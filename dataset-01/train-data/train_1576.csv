4,Jello Girl,"As a child growing up in the cornfields of Minnesota, I LOVED my mother's Lime Jello Tuna Casserole. Besides Lime Jello, her recipe includes one can of tuna, a cup of mayo, sliced green pimiento-stuffed olives and chopped celery for crunchiness.There was some controversy in the neighborhood as to whether this was not actually a Jello salad rather than a jello casserole, but I was unconcerned with the semantics. My mother, a devout Lutheran, would not let me peek into the frig until it was done, and I never caught that magic moment when the mixture became a jiggly solid."
1,Zero stars.,"I would give this zero stars if I could. Aspartame is poisonous. Its effects on the body are more dire when it is heated. I gained a large amount of weight when I started ingesting ""diet"" products such as sugar free Jell-O, Diet Coke, sugar free gum, etc. I was chronically fatigued 24/7. My brain ""fog"" was so bad I couldn't think. I was depressed. All of these are symptoms of aspartame poisoning, and luckily, they all went away after I discontinued use of aspartame."
5,Great little router bit,"I used this bit to make a groove down the center of 3/4"" stock (both pine & oak) for a nice looking profile for picture frames. Cutts clean and makes an attractive profile on the face of float frames.."
5,Didn't Expect It To Be This Good!,"Five minutes into the OVA, I was hooked. Rarely do I ever become so emotionally involved with the story and the characters. The dialogue was mature and philosophical. I won't tell you any part of the story because it has been elaborated on from the other reviewers. I purchased this Director's Cut version not too long ago and overall I am very pleased due to the entire story continuing seamlessly but there were some minor dialogue changes that I thought was inaccurate from the originals. I recommend this version but I would highly recommend the original Trust and Betrayal DVDs due to the exactness of the dialogues as a whole."
5,A real tearjerker...,"This movie is based on some of the flashbacks from the Rurouni Kenshin manga, and is done very well. Fans of the TV series should enjoy this, as long as they are prepared to see Kenshin when he wasn't such a great hero. The animation style is different, it's more realistic. This movie is violent and dark, but it's really moving and definitely got me crying. By comparison, the TV series is more light-hearted. There isn't really any humor in this movie, so be prepared."
5,Excellent and Gripping Story!,"Very well presented, and written. Would recommend to anyone, whether Rurouni Kenshin Fan or just simply into Anime."
4,Wow,"Wow, I didn't actually think that ADV was going to release the directors cut in the USA. Basically its the same thing as Trust and betrayal, except that the two episodes are combined into one 2 hour movie, and put into ""wide screen"" (Top and bottom are just cut off). There are also a few extra scenes not included in the original version. If you already own Trust and Betrayal I suppose its up to you if you want to fork out another 30 bucks to see a couple extra scenes or not (the whole ""wide screen"" thing is pointless since they just cut the bottom and top off).You might want to check your local video rental store first."
5,Not so much a review but a warning ...,"I'd like potential buyers to know that this particular version - the 2003 release ""Samurai X - Trust & Betrayal (Director's Cut)"" is completely missing the music track.Both voice tracks as well as the sound effect track are present, but the key ommision of the music track is nontrivial."
5,SAMURAI X IS THE BEST!,"This is the best movie I have ever spent $22.00 on! The graphics are great and are a welcome change of pace from the anime from the TV series(not that they're bad). The battles are the best, especially the ambush of the meeting(love the music there)! Be warned that the battles are EXTREMELY BLOODY and some are very gross. If you buy this, you'll want to buy the soundtrack, Samurai X Ova Soundtrack! SAMURAI X 4 EVER!"
4,Excellent movie!!!,"I recently saw a episode of Rurouni Kenshin on Cartoon Network and found the show to be very interesting. I purchased all 95 episodes on DVD and became hooked. After I finished watching all 95 episodes, I wanted to learn more about Kenshin Himura, the man formerly known as Hitokiri Battousai, the rebellion's most feared assassin. When I learned that a movie was available on DVD that was a prequel to the series, I immediately ordered it and was blown away by the story and artwork. All the questions that anyone may have about the series and about Kenshin's past will be revealed, including how he got his famous cross shape scar and why he became a wanderer. My only complaint is that the dub does not stay true with the translation. All in all, this is an excellent addition to anyone's anime library who is a fan of Rurouni Kenshin."
5,Think of it as two for one,"Trust and Betrayal are both excellent OAV's but this is not are review on the content, but the disc it's self. If you already have the original two releases, then I don't think there is enough justification to buy this release. But if you are just now getting around to purchasing Trust and Betrayal then you can get them both on one DVD."
2,"If you already own trust and betrayal, skip this dvd","because there is NO point getting this for less than 10 seconds worth of additional scenes that you really aren't going to notice much.Gee, let me see.. there is that additional half sec of kenshin stabbing and twisting his sword, additional 1 sec of using two hands to cut down a man, additional 3 sec of battle in the bridge scene, couple additional facial shots in different angle.. and oh, all four anime packed into one dvd in original Japanese OVA style.. and this coming from a guy who saw trust and betrayal over 10 times. I really wonder what was ADV's point of bringing this masterpiece back as ""director's CUT"" when there really.. isn't much to offer other than saving $$If you haven't seen or own trust and betrayal, by all means get this DVD. your basically getting two for one deal, but if you already own both, trust me - skip it."
1,Disappointed,"I would first like to say that I really enjoy Rurouni Kenshin and the especially the Samurai X movies, however, having said that I was greatly disappointed with this release. I was hoping for more than an additional fight sequence that appeared in the very end of the movie. Also, I was very bummed, by the lack of extras on the DVD itself. In all the DVD is quite worth it if you don't own Trust and Betrayal. Another redeeming quality if you don't own the aformentioned movies is Director's Cut is one long feature not divided into two episodes as it appears on the other two DVDs. Also, the cover is reversible, but the reverse artwork really was not that great. Overall, the only reason I gave this DVD 1 star was because it is Samurai X and the story is wonderful, but if already own T&B don't bother."
1,Samurai X - Trust & Betrayal (Director's Cut),"Very Boring. For something title Samurai X, there really wasnt much fighting.... just lots and lots of repetitive dialog. not even worth adding to your anime collection"
5,FAW ROCKS!!!!,I am going to totally agree with Zeldie. Fall As Well's music absolutely has a way of wrapping around you and pulling you in. There is an abundance of creativity that you don't find in a lot of the newer bands on the scene. You can feel every word that Jarrod sings and every note the band plays. They are an AWESOME band to see live!!!! FAW was signed to Imprint for a (very good) reason. Knowing Todd Harrell and his wife was just a bonus! GO BUY THIS CD!!!! It is absolutely worth it! It has not come out of my car yet!!!!
2,Disappointment,"I heard ""Lazy Eye"" as a single and really liked it. The version on this CD is different (not that big of a deal) and the rest of the CD is pretty boring. I have nothing HARSH to say about the guys (unlike some others that have posted here) other than I really don't care for this CD at all. Whoever did the remix for Lazy Eye totally saved the song... Consider using him/her again..."
1,Terrible album,"The production quality is horrible. The songs suck and have no hooks except for Lazy Eye. Apparently someone helped them write Lazy Eye (see songwriting credit in cover). I can't imagine this band having any success (at least not on this effort). The singer is really weak, no studio magic here. All in al,l a terrible album."
1,Terrible,"Do not purchase this product. It actually creates more work than is necessary and is an embarrassment to the Rain X product line. I used these wipes to clean the inside of my windows/windshield (which were fairly clean to begin with) and to provide some fog protection. When I wiped down the inside of each window, it left terrible streaks that ended up making the windows dirtier-looking than I have ever seen them. The only solution was to go back over each of the windows with a microfiber towel...which then removed all of the anti-fog protection. I could have done better with Windex and a paper towel because I could have used the wasted time to put another coat of wax on the car. Bottom line: If you purchase this product, expect to use twice the effort and achieve none of the advertised results."
1,We Repeat: Do Not Buy These,"My windshield was clean and my car is new (first Winter in my new Scion xD). I ran out of the $1 spritz can of no-fog I bought last year in the check out lane of my local grocery...so I went in search of a replacement. I picked these because I thought it was a name I could trust.WRONG! I used one and it left streaks all over my windshield and the side windows. I tried another; same result. I worked over the windows until I could see through them...but the fogging was not diminished...it was WORSE.This is a useless product no matter the price. I am headed back to the check out lane to see if I can find that little blue can--when I do, I'll let you know what it is."
5,"If you are not using this on your windshield, ask yourself why?","This is the best windshield product on the market. Use this monthly, and the rain will bead-off your windshield. I have used Rain-X for years, and now to have it on an applicator, makes treating your windshield a no-brainer."
1,Don't work at all.,"I apply this product on my windsheild but does not work at all. I'll just stick with the spray on formulated one, it's more concentrated."
1,Requires Way Too Much Effort,"This product is almost like a wax for your (interior) glass. Yes, the instructions say ""use a clean ... microfiber cloth to buff out excess haze and remove excess material."" Unless you're OCD about your cleaning efforts, you'll spend DAYS finding new places where this stuff is still lingering. I'm sorry I didn't heed the previous reviews before purchasing, but the Rain-X Glass Cleaner wipes will cause you way more work than should be required. Windex and a clean rag for me from now on.I've used one wipe out of the package. The rest are now in the trash, since I don't want to mistakenly happen upon them again down the road ..."
4,Relive HoMM and KING'S BOUNTY pre-game included!,This comes with King's Bounty a prequel if you will to Heroes of Might and Magic (HoMM). An old board game was used as basis of King's Bounty- OGRE the 70s old school strategy Board Game (I think Origin Systems made a home computer version too in the 1980s).The other games are classic Heroes of Might and Magic fare with excellent expansion adding replay value. On a fun note - the King's Bounty has been re-released on PS2 as Heroes of Might and Magic: Quest for the DragonBone Staff!
2,"Bad graphics, slow gameplay","When I first got Heroes of Might and Magic, I thought it would be a great game. But when I installed it, I was very frustarted. The game had bad graphics, and slow battles. The creatures were huge, and battles slow. And when the creatures died, they poofed away in a cloud of smoke. Uh huh, that was realistic! The best thing I can say about this game is that it can be very addicting. Even thought I disliked it VERY MUCH, it got addicting. It was something that was cheap and I could play quickly, even though it was cheezy. I don't think this game is very hot, but if you want a cheap game to addict yourself on with poor graphics and a funny story line, go ahead!"
3,Good story with an unlikeable main character.,"The story had a nice flow, and seemed like an honest look at what the world was like in those times. However, the main character/author is far too arrogant and hypocritical, which gets tiring to read quite quickly."
3,pricey but good,I really enjoyed this product.I just really hate that its French.Gave a 5 star for product and a 1 star for where it can from so it got a 3 star.
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT.IT IS SUPER SUPER SALTY...LIKE KOSHER SALT(CHEAPER CERTAINLEY)I HAD IT MIXED IN A CHOCOLATE BAR THAT I PURCHASE. THERE IT SEEMED MUCH BETTER.ON IT'S OWN.. WELL, MELTING ICE WITH THIS STUFF WOULD BE A BETTER MODE FOR IT."
3,not sure what to expect,"This tastes like damp salt to me. I can not really tell why this is so different than table salt. Yes it is not uniform in shape, but it was hard to sprinkle on a caramel cake. I was hoping the grains would be more visible on the cake."
4,This is one funny and great Army men game!,Army men is a great game.besides the fact that they are the worst pc army men graphics.I got this game for my birthday about 4 or 5 years ago and I still play it. Every stinkin new milatary game out there has all this totally unnessisary blood and language. Army men deserves its E rating. controlling Sarge is diificult at first but once you get used to them its great. The story is good and so are the voices.Army men has great music and adds to the world war II authenticity. Army men also adds its plastic twist to the combat. Examples are throwing grendades at the tans and they explode into ittie bittie chunks of plastic. Or shooting a tan and his head fly's off. But its at an over head view so its not gross or extremely violent.The game rocks! Its a great buy and works somewhat well on windows XP.Get is now!
5,Vitality through the roof!,"After incorporating just a few concepts from Jeff's book, I feel way more energetic throughout my day. Starting with breakfast, my mind and body feel full of energy and other people see it. See for yourself."
4,8 Hours of Healing Wisdom with a Laugh!,"This 2 Dvd 1 Bluray set has the foundation of Jeff's food healing system in a concise and humorous manner. Filled with precise detail and protocols for almost all our modern illnesses it walks you through step by step by step providing the WHY and the HOW! I use it to share the system with other people.Best of all it's not some multilevel marketing supplement based system. While there are some supplements mentioned, most of the system is based on whole organic foods! When supplements are mentioned the reason why and the specific brand is mentioned based on substantial research!"
1,If only it were possible to give this a minus rating.,"This, I believe, is the dumbest movie ever made. The nonviolent pacifist uses violence to achieve his ends. Its garbled message is just too hard to believe. Don't waste your time or money on this pathetic piece of junk. I was completely clueless at the time and still am to see what others saw/see in this clunker."
2,Awesomely Pretentious,"I was twelve years old when I saw this on the big screen and loved every minute of it. Today I feel a trickle of cold sweat whenever the movie is mentioned.It isn't so much that BILLY JACK is a bad movie as it is an awesomely pretentious one rife with hypocrisy. The story of non-violent native Americans and flower children saved from hysterical cowboys by Billy Jack (who wants to be non-violent but always has to kick butt) is well-intentioned, but from a modern standpoint it is more than just a little embarassing. The production values are so-so, and the cast is merely adequate at best. If you have fond memories of this film, keep them by leaving BILLY JACK in the past: don't see it again. And if you have never seen it... leave well enough alone."
1,I gave i 1 star only because it made me laugh,"And whats not to laugh at? Poorly directed, the dialouge is idiotic, and the message is a joke. I went to a private college that was pacafist, and pacafism does not denote naieve stupidity. This film has the most retarted message of any movie. But at least the action scenes are decent, even though his karate is not quite up to par."
4,A classic from the 1970's,Sit back and enjoy. Keep in mind when this movie was made. Enjoy the martial arts and the hero persona projected by Billy Jack. This one is classic good against evil.
2,I forgot how lame the sixties were,"I saw this movie for the first time in a drive-in theater during the mid-seventies, and remembered how much I loved it. Seeing it again convinced me that my teenage world was quite narrow - this movie is so sappy, it's pathetic. At first, I thought my reaction was unfair, until my kids (ages 10 and 8) started laughing at the movie's best parts! (Yes, I skipped over some scenes while they were in the room). Although most guys agree that the line about ""this boot"" and ""your face"" is the ultimate tough-guy threat, the movie definitely reminds me of how confrontational everything seemed to be back then."
5,Great movie but still in standard Full Frame!!!,"I hate to gripe but Warner Bros. is releasing again ""Billy Jack"" in Standard 1.33 full frame! Lots of people now have 16.9 widescreen tv's and would like a 1.85 widescreen version,the original ratio of the movie,Ventura had this in widescreen(with a beautiful transfer,5.1 sound as well as original mono and 2 commentaries!) as part of the now out of print ""Ultimate Billy Jack Collection"" (I have 2 copies/1 opened and 1 sealed!) The transfer that Warner used for the 1999 tranfer will obviously the same one used here,the same mono soundtrack,just new packing,no snapper case. It's also coming out on Blu Ray,I hope thats widescereen! Like the cover art though!"
3,Didn't Really Work For Me,"After I saw this film I tried that thing where you take your shoes off when you're going to fight somebody, and the guy stepped on my toes with his boot and then he kicked my derriere into next week."
3,Differing woth those who beg to differ,"As a former martial artist, child of the '60's and part Native American Buddhist (no fooling) I've got to tell you that I found Billy Jack embarrassing in 1971 and--while I've no desire to relive the experience--I've no doubt I'd find it so now.Having looked at the issue from both sides, (or all three, if you will,) I find no more ""message"" in the film than in Sly Stallone's mindlessly violent epics. It basically says that if you're tough enough you can get away with stuff. It also says, in subtext, that there's no such thing as a violent proponent of non-violence, but that there certainly are such things as hypocrites.Oh, yeah...the Native American ritual stuff was laughable. Maybe that single laugh was the merit of the film."
1,Is This Really Necessary?,"There's a reason this video is not widely available, and it should be obvious to any one who has had any previous exposure to the film. The best thing about Billy Jack on video is that you can always turn it off-- something you couldn't do when you went to see it on the big screen."
2,"If you're old enough to remember when this first came out,","you more than likely thought it was one of the greatest films ever made, and left the theatre holding your fist high in support of all Billy Jack stood for. I know I did. He was, after, on the side that mattered.Watch it again now. My first reaction was, ""What the hell did I ever see in this?"" And not because I've become a conservative in my more mature (ahem)age, either, because I most definitely haven't. There's nothing wrong with the basic principals in the movie, but they get lost here. I just think that in your teens, you look at films far more emotionally than critically.This one had medicore to just bad acting, a paper-thin plot, and included almost every stereotype in the book. This is another one to buy cheap... if at all."
1,"An enigma wrapped in a tortilla, smothered in bean dip...","There's something touching about this film until you really begin to dissect it. Finally, the dichotomy becomes evident: peace-loving hippies and Indians against the 'establishment'. This film managed to enjoin revolution-based politics with brain-baked standards and really took the entertainment value out of movie-going. This looks like a direct antithesis to ""The Green Berets"" and remains a symbolic statement that forged a trend in Hollywood. The only things missing were the SDS, the Weather Underground, and the Black Panthers. At a time when the Barrow/Parker gang and Butch Cassidy and the Hole-in-the-Wall gang were being glorified in sweeping cinematic grandeur - just short of a musical - it's no wonder that Billy Jack was standing in the wings. If you really want to get depressed, check out the sequels..."
1,Blu Ray Review,I loved the movie but gave the blu ray a rating of 1 because the studio was too cheap to include sub-titles. Some of us who were around when the movie was first released may not have all of our hearing intact. Is it too much to ask of a transfer-to-blu ray to have subtitles? I will not purchase it and cannot reccomend it to anyone.
5,Billy Jack as good today as it was years ago,I love this movie as much today as I did seeing it growing up. Ok the fact that Tom isn't hard on the eyes is one thing but I love the story line.I love watching him kick the crap out of the bad guys! Ok give it a break it's an old movie and the quality is that of that time era...which I would give anything to go back to. The music is good. Coven's version of One Tin Soldier is amazing. The kids in the school ...love it! Love those rebel stand up for what you believe in songs!Give me these good old movies over the garbage of today anytime!
1,Billy Jackoff,What is the worst movie ever made? It's a tie between Billy Jack and the Trial of Billy Jack. Jackoff abhors violence until it's time to save the children and then he attacks the establishment with the relish of pit bull smelling blood. Full of bovine blather about Flower Power and Death to the Pigs. Unless you're a Nazi skip this and watch a nature film on the sex life of a sea slug.
1,A big wheel of stinky cheese!,"Billy's fake rez accent seems to have inspired every wannabe since 1971. It is easily one of the most stupid films made. Billy Jack is the quintessential film people of ""a certain generation"" recall when they think of ""native spirituality"".The native element to the film is, at best, fantasy. For example, the mix-up with the outfits is bizarre. When Billy does his ""snake dance"" with his Arizona tribe he's decked out in quasi-Plains garb. The extras wear outfits seemingly from every John Wayne western ever made.If people want to see a film that more accurately represents Native Americans, I recommend Dance Me Outside, Smoke Signals or Pow Wow Highway."
2,Incredibly dated and unintentionally funny.,"The plot: Half Indian, ex-Green Beret punches, kicks, and shoots his way through waves of rednecks making the world safe for flower power.One of my all time favorite bad movies! I watch it everytime it comes on TV and laugh my head off. There is so much to enjoy here for a bad movie lover. The dated politics- the Freedom School? The hypocritical message- peace and love and karate chops to the throat. The bad acting- Delores Taylor is so wooden that I think I could make a cabinet out of her. The phony spirituality- the Snake Dance? It all adds up to an extremely humorous look at arrogant, self-important filmmaking. ""Billy Jerk"" is one film that is not to be missed."
2,billy joke,"Amateurish hippie crap. The only good things about the movie are scenery and the ...and the uh....hmmmm ....let me think for a while. Of course one side had to be totally good and one side totally evil. And we can't have Tom Laughlin's wife's freedom school losers be the evil ones can we? This movie is basically a repetition of every hippie myth propagated by the left during the sixties and seventies about all those wonderful losers er dreamers who wanted to sit around do drugs and sing awful neo-folk songs and the (gasp, shudder) the establishment (boo, hiss) who only want to shoot things like horses and puppies and kittens while acting like violent racists towards everybody who isn't a member of the Elks. A really awful movie. But I love the western scenery, so I'll bump it up to two stars."
3,"Somewhat dated, but entertaining!","I watched this movie as a 10 year old and found it to be an awesome movie. Upon further review, I found that this movie lost some of it's touch. The movie seems dated with all the hippies walking around. But, Tom Laughin as Billy Jack makes the movie work. BTW, the original Billy Jack movie was ""The Born Losers"" back in 1967. It works!"
3,INDIAN TREATMENT,the points made in the movie about the way that the treatys were broken was true and the way that the indian people were shunned and mistreated by not only our government but by the whites as well.they made treaty after treaty and none of the treatys were honored
4,A graphical novel without pictures,"I liked the style of this book a lot. It was almost graphical, punctuated just right, very moving. Tears rolled off my cheeks when I read this story's last exchange between G'Kar and Vir. The story seemlessly used most of the Babylon 5 characters and kept them strictly in-character.And there wasn't only a one main plot either. A lot was going on on the station, and the pieces fit neatly together.The events take place after ""The Coming of Shadows"" and before ""The Long, Twilight Struggle""."
4,RARA AVIS,"I must be getting old and jaded. The subject matter certainly didn't throw me for a loop as it seems to have done to others. In fact, this novel acurately depicts the period and people of 19th England.My only gripe is very tiny. Ms. Holman just has to be non English. Indian summer I believe is an American phenonomen and I don't think ""quilts"" would be a word Brits would have used.Overall, this is a rare bird -- a book you can enjoy and learn from."
2,Do not lodge here...,"If atmospheric fiction about prostitutes trying to survive in the underbelly of 19th-century England is your cup of tea, try ""The Crimson Petal and the White"" instead. I started this book with eager anticipation, thinking that it would be similar to that wonderful work, but the grimness and arch pretension of ""The Dress Lodger"" are such that I probably will not finish (especially after reading some reviews by fellow readers that were less than underwhelmed). Go directly to Michel Faber's fabulous novel and give it a go. I promise you will not be disappointed!"
2,Unremittingly depressing,"The writing style is annoying as all get out, but at least there were no typos or misspelled words, and the grammar was fine- that is honestly why it gets 2 stars instead of 1. The characters were very unsympathetic, and I didn't realize until 20 pages from the end that Gustine is supposed to be the protagonist. It's gruesome and ugly, and I felt like it really captured the feeling of working class 1831, but that's a horrible, horrible feeling. Everyone's a prisoner of ugly circumstances, and almost everyone is a deeply flawed person doing deeply wrong things for their own right reasons."
5,Quite incredible and wonderful,"Who could guess that historical ficiton about cholera, body-dissecting doctors and sad whores could be so delicious?? This book manages to weaves together complex stories, colorful characters and engrossing history into one terrific package. Dickensian in the best sense of the word, the novel tuned me in to an extraordinary new voice in fiction. I'd recommend this book to anyone..it's that great."
1,Disappointment,"The book had an interesting premise, characters that I thought I would care about. I dragged myself through the first half of the book thinking it would grab me. Never did. I found the rambling stream of conciseness writing style a distraction and the subject matter too grim, between the two I lost interest. The book was filled with ugliness, not a glimmer of hope for the characters or alas the poor reader. The best part was when I gave myself permission to skim the last 80 pages.Overwhelmingly a non-hit with the book club."
2,Great concept - the implementation didn't grab me,"Sheri Holman had a powerful concept, an intriguing plot, and characters with lots of potential. I just wish she would have refrained from doing something too many contemporary authors do, get in the way of their own stories. I thought there were too many self-conscious effrots to be ""literary."" (It starts right in Chapter 1, where after a while, she wonders if she started the novel by introducing us the the worng character.) That sort of creative-writing-workshop stuff can be OK in the rioght spot, but definitely not here, when there was a story that could have been so poweerful had it not been weighed down with cute writing technique. I would have given the book 5 stars had allowed the story to shine through on its own."
2,Good story but difficult read,The base story is engaging however the writing style is awkward and the overly complicated. Not a book I will be re-reading unfortunately.
3,the second time through is easier,"Interesting read. The story changes from 1st and 3rd person which was hard to follow at times. Overall I enjoyed the author's way of allowing the reader to ""enter"" in the book. I believe the writing style helps readers feel the time period. It was suspensful and tragic."
4,Engrossing,"Frequently when I read a historical novel, I feel like I am not getting a true sense of the period. This was definitely not the case in The Dress Lodger. Although I did not identify closely with any of the characters, I was engrossed by the book and enjoyed reading it."
3,The Darkest Side of Victorian England,"Very much in the spirit of classic Victorian novels of the down-trodden, ""The Dress-Lodger"" explores the darker side of the Industrial Revolution by giving it the face of Gustine, the potter-by-day and streetwalker by night. Wonderfully written, the writer holds back nothing in describing the desparate resignation (or is that resigned desparation?) of Gustine's plight, and that of her melodramatically handicapped child. And that is perhaps where things began to go awry for me. About half-way through the book, the plot absconded with the characters, bearing them off into pecular plot twists and turns that seemed to bear little relation to the beautifully drawn sections in the first half. As the hero, Dr. Chiver is particularly difficult not only to like, but to believe is a real as his behavior becomes increasing outlandish. Still, worth reading, if only for the well-crafted descriptions."
3,Vivid descriptions but too depressing for me,"The author does a good job of describing the terrible conditions these poor people live in and fleshing out her characters. I simply found the subject matter too depressing. I disliked ""Angela's Ashes"" for the same reason."
2,unfortunately disappointing,"As a big fan of historical fiction, I thought this would be right up my alley. Unfortunately, the writer uses a tone that is oddly distancing from the action of the novel -- you never become fully absorbed in the time and place. Additionally, the charaters are rather slight (too much action, not enough feeling/thinking). The ending is just flat-out anitclimactic."
3,Enjoyable historical fiction,"I thought this book was enjoyable and kept my interest. The characters were bizarre and different from most one-dimensional people in current popular fiction. Some of the medical scenes were fascinating. My only major complaint (which occurred mainly in the first few chapters) was the too ""cute"" writing of the author. Those who have read this book may know what I mean: ""...Now, dear reader, let us follow so-and-so..."" I found it cloying and unnecessary. Once I got more involved with the characters the writing (at least to me) improved. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading about class society in early 19th century England."
3,"extravagant, overwrought, sensationalism","Very readable, which is my main criterium for a book. The prose is lush, extravagant, sensational. The overall impression of the book is of crowded, smelly, disgusting streets filled with extremely poor, diseased, distressed people, lots of noise and movement. The author seems to have done a lot of research and is really a better writer than many, but still the book is overwhelming and repetitive (just in case you don't get the point the author is making), and the outcome obvious, and after a while I resorted to dipping into different chapters to follow the plot, but not reading every word."
4,took a little while...,"This book does take time to get into. For me to consider a book good, i have to care about the character and wonder what is going to happen next. In this novel, it took until I was half way finished before i really was intersted in the lives of the characters. Interesting story. I did truly enjoy the end."
4,Good,"It is a very good, detailed story. Sometimes i was confused, but then i got what was going on. The books gets better, so force yourself through the first 2 chapters! Overall, very good."
2,Travelogue of 1830,This interesting book about life in 1830's England lacked the personal narrative to make it compelling. The use of multiple points of view made it difficult to become involved in a single person's problems. The book became an interesting viewing of the horrors of life surrounded by poverty and assaulted by plague. Unfortunately the research and understanding was not translated into characterizations that took hold of us. This book does not involve us like Girl with a Pearl Earring does in a similar historical setting. That is too bad because the author did fine work otherwise.
2,This book is a challenge,"As other reviewers have pointed out, the cover blurb to this book suggested an engrossing story. With eagerness I bought it! The author's narrative method, however, is unusual. It changes from third person to third person, plays around with chronology and, occasionally, speaks directly to the reader to form a view about a scene or a character. Frankly, I did not like this approach - I wanted to read a story and instead my mind was being challenged from all directions. This is not a criticism - as you can see from the customer reviews, many people love this book and Holman is a clever writer. But I did not enjoy the style of writing and could not finish the book."
4,A tragi-comedy,"It's referred to as ""Dickensian"" but, viewed from our perspective at the dawn of the 21st century, the conditions of the day are even more chilling.By the end, however, there is light at the end of the tunnel--like a Stephen King novel gone horribly right!"
2,great in theory; mediocre in reality....,"The book started off with such finesse- a great plot, unique and enjoyable writing style, wonderfully complex characters and the promise of topics so rarely written about. Why then did it go downhill??? I still can't understand what happened. I raved about the first one hundred or so pages and couldn't put it down. Somewhere along the way I reached the point where I couldn't even finish the book, save to skim the last chapters. I think the dark subject matter just became too much- cholera morbis, body snatching, class disparities and ignorance...not enough to keep this reader interested or to lead to a positive recommendation."
1,Irritatingly pretentious and excessively gruesome,"The Dress Lodger is one of the bleakest books I have ever read. The story is dark and lacking in any kind of subtlety, the descriptions of grave-robbing, autopsies, and death from cholera are morose and gruesome, and the characters are unrelentingly unsympathetic and grotesque. Moreover, there is too much going on in the story. There are too many lives whose stories are being told, too many points of view. The author seems to tell the story both through the eyes of different characters and through the eyes of an omiscient narrator whose identity, when revealed, is simply unbelievable. By the time I reached the book's inconclusive conclusion, and realized that I didn't really care about any of its characters, I felt manipulated and just plain annoyed."
2,Highly over-rated,"This book is strange, dark, unhappy, twisted, and somewhat boring. I had to force myself to finish it. Don't expect historical fiction, just historical boredom and dreariness. Definitely not a book to be judged by its cover. Strange such a normal looking author should write such an odd, morbid novel in which everyone is just plain bad or sad."
1,Not my type of book,"I really thought this book would be different, but it was a hot mess. I just couldn't get into. The surgeon freaked me out. I think I was fascinated by the title and the vibrant blue dress on the cover. I couldn't even tell you what I was expecting, but after I read it, I immediately put it into the donate bin."
2,Dry,"I will join the small number of reviewers who did not find this book fascinating or captivating. It was slow, dry and dull. I found it did not hold my attention and thus remained on the bookshelf collecting dust. Despite several attempts to get back into the book, I was simply unable to finish it. I may try again; however, it is more likely that I will send this book to the used bookstore."
2,"Too ""out there"" to be believeable; couldn't finish","The truth in the streets of Sunderland was probably not far off the in-depth descriptions, but I could not finish this novel. The first few chapters grabbed me, but as the characters became more intwined with one another, the plausibility decreased to the point that I found myself skimming. Gustine was such a pathetic creature, perhaps the most admirable. The others were far from human and the story became so twisted that it lacked credibility. The historical background for old England and the potteries was my favorite part."
2,Did Not Enjoy Reading,"I did not really enjoy this book from the character stand point. The majority of the characters were wrapped up in themselves and I was not able to really visualize them. Gustine's evening occupation was not at all glamorus. There were also many examples of ""racism"" with characters from the upper class towards the lower class. I do realize that this was a factor in the 1800's but I did not like reading about it. The writing style, such as ""dear reader"", was very confusing. I did think the historical points in the book were some what interesting."
4,Beautiful and compelling historical novel!,"Sheri Holman has given us a fascinating study of the weakness of the human heart with this fascinating novel. Set in cholera stricken England, The Dress Lodger is an interesting and engaging tale of Gustine, a young woman forced to be a ""dress lodger,"" who, in exchange for rent and the care of her frail, newborn child, wears an expensive dress and acts as an escort of sorts. She meets Henry Chiver, a doctor running from his past, and hopes that he may help her sick child. However, Chiver has his own agenda, first seeking dead bodies as his salvation, and then the live one of Gustine's son. There are various enthralling moments in this novel. The Dress Lodger is an excellent work of historical fiction filled with believable and heartbreaking characters. The story is wonderful and compelling -- full of twists and turns, minus the saccharine language that accompanies most historical novels. Highly recommended..."
3,A good airplane read,"I picked up this book on a business trip and finished it in a day. It moves right along, from the opening page to the closing scene. I took the liberty to ""ruin"" the novel by reading the reader's guide questions and the author's notes in the back--which didn't reveal all that much. A body snatching doctor, a young, street-smart urchin/mother/prostitute and a sea of struggling poor--it sets a good backdrop for a interesting story.By no means is this book a feat of literary genius, nor will you want to rush out and get a hardbound copy, but a trade paperback and a couple of spare hours in a hotel room will leave you satisfied. You won't have to waste your mind on drivel, but you will be able to relax from the highbrow likes of Milan Kundera (who I well love, but by no means can read in a stuffy hotel room.) Bring this book on a trip or to the beach."
4,"If you are depressed, save this book for later!","Cholera epidemic, poverty, prostitution, grave-robbing.... Could have been written by a deeply depressed Charles Dickens.However, this really was a very good book, difficult to put down. The prose is well done; it is obvious Holman was meticulous in her research of both historical and medical detail. The uniqueness of the plot will keep you reading in spite of its bleakness. This is not a light read, and as a caution to readers with sensitive natures, you really shouldn't read this if you aren't emotionally ready for it. It's humorless, but deep -- far from dull. Fans of historical settings and character analysis will appreciate this one."
3,Strong Stuff!,"The story of a pretty,young prostitute who hires a glamourous blue ball gown from a pimp,to attract customers.She is the mother of a baby who was born with his heart outside his chest cavity,and attracts the attention of a young doctor who was involved in the infamous Burke and Hare scandal of body snatching and the murder of indigents to supply cadavers for medical schools. The prose is wonderful and the stench of filth,poverty and death remains in ones nostrils.This is life at its most degrading and the thought that people really lived like this is unbelievable!You'll need a hot bath a a good hair scrub after reading this!"
4,Riveting,"I couldn't put it down......The unpredictability of the secret narrators was an outstanding literary twist. And while some may have found it gruesome, let's face it, the cholera epidemic wasn't pretty. I think the descriptions were probably fairly realistic. I only wish the ending would have been more fulfilling. Unfortunately, after deftly establishing the characters and their plights, it seemed like Sheri Holman ran out of steam. Despite this, I'm still recommending the Dress Lodger to everyone I know."
4,"Interesting story, but tiresome writing style. . .","""~I found myself engrossed by the disturbing story, but was constantly distracted by the annoying, pretentious second-person writing style. This story could have been written beautifully without this attempt to make it ""different"" by referring to the reader (?) as ""you"", when the ""you"" keeps changing. in the early 19th century."
1,Big disappointment.,"This book was highly recommended, and a big disappointment. I did not enjoy the writing style at all. If I hadn't read the jacket description, I would never have figured out the plot. I pulled the bookmark about 1/4 into it, and I rarely do that. The only good thing to say about this book is the speedy delivery by Amazon."
1,"Annoying to read, don't waste your time",I could not wrap my head around this book. The writing was just strange. It was like the author was trying to put me into the story. It was written in the present tense which I found to just be annoying. I couldn't concentrate on the story because of it.Too annoying to continue with it. It wasn't worth it. one and 1/2 stars.
1,Disappointing..,"Loving history, rich detail, medicine, period pieces, I was anxious to read this, but absolutely could not maintain interest. I didnt care about the characters, nothing they did moved me, and I didnt feel anything exciting from the period. Reading it felt more like an assignment than pleasure. If you want to feel the real excitement of being there, being educated and richly entertained while reading, try Ken Follet's ""The Pillars of the Earth"" - (this is not a spy novel)."
2,Disappointing to say the least,"I've had such great luck getting book recommendations from Amazon based on previous books that I've purchased (The Reader, The Mark of An Angel, Girl in Hyacinth Blue, Girl with a Pearl Earring) I thought that I couldn't lose with this recommend. How wrong I was.I found this book unengrossing, slow and tedious. The story just drags. I wanted to scream GET ON WITH IT. I didn't care about Gustine, the Eye, Pink or Henry. Why would I? These characters were completely undeveloped. Similar to some of Anne Rice's books in which Anne goes on forever with some historical description (but interestingly, I might add) the author of this book puts the reader to sleep with her writing.Help! I need a really great book after this one. But on a positive note, I guess four out of five ain't bad. Thanks for the mostly wonderful suggestions, Amazon."
1,Pretentious- grisly - depressing- morbid,"I bought this book based on the strength of the advert in the book club and was looking forward to reading it. What a surprise when I got it! And what a dissapointment. The pretentious narrator destroyed any sympathy I could have had for the characters of this grim, grisly and depressing depiction of this period in English history. I found the constant 'dear reader' cloying and distanting. If Ms. Holman thought she would become the modern equivalent of Dickens with this book, she couldn't be more wrong. Her loving detail with the death scenes is morbid in the extreme. Dickens wrote a lot of grim detail too, but his characters were filled with hope and love and the promise of redemption. These characters are not!I can't remember what author said it, but this is not a book to be tossed aside gently, it should be thrown with great force against the wall. I'm just sorry I can't give it no stars."
2,The Dress Lodger,"Because I loved ""The Mammoth Cheese"" by this author, I thought I'd enjoy this book as well. I just could not get through it. The story line is vague & confusing & the writing is belabored & boring. What a disappointment."
4,"The Dress Lodger, a book like no other","This well written book takes us to a colorful time and place that will fascinate, surprise, horrify and also amuse the reader. An unusual reading experience."
4,Fabulous,"I have just finished turning the last page of The Dress Lodger and I have to say that it was Fabulous!! Holman managed to shock me with the character development. I loved what she did with each character. I was especially satisfied with the ending. As for the history surrounding the plot, I have to say that she brought the reader into 19th century England. It was wonderful. The gloom and gore of the setting is only the reality that was 19th century England. Bravo to Holman!!!"
4,funky music,"Fabulous funky sounds by Cassius with a delicious french taste, from the same Daft Punk, Dimitri from Paris groovy family that can make you dance all night long or listen them in your walkman, you car or house without being bored. An intelligent and esential fresh and tasty disc. Totally recommendable."
5,Fascinating!,"By itself, the concept of psychological maturity justifies the time spent reading this book. Fascinating viewpoint. Full of useful gems."
5,Life changing,"I highly recommend this book. It offers a way of looking at things that actually made sense for me, and it came at a time when I really needed it. Read this book, and ignore the negative reviews here. It's worth the effort."
1,Nothing new,"Well, it's been about 7 years and psychology hasn't been turned on its ear. I suspect that this book and its author are perturbed, but I can't think of a reason that they should think otherwise. The book is vague, barely readable, very obtuse. If a new paradigm is to be found in psychology, I think it will be understandable to the masses, not just the intelligentsia."
1,Great help as long as you don't really need it!,"If you're over 40 and looking for hope and you've completed all the S1 stuff he talks about earlier, then you'll like this book. If you didn't, I feel very sorry for you because you'll still have the perfect ability to understand the hopeless situation he describes you as being in and then just leaves you in with no chance of moving forward. In other words, this is a typical product of our self-satisfied generation of ""To h--- with you, I got mine, look how smart I am!"" medical types."
1,Pretense,"This book is fairly pretentious in that it makes a lot of noise about changing psychology, and it comes with lots of recommendations, but really it doesn't say much at all. For instance, it calls homosexuality ""sexual behavior"", and never really addresses it. I suspect the author is of the belief that one can ""develop"" beyond it to heterosexuality; I, however, do not believe that. It smacks of the Reagan era, which was way repressed. On the other hand, the book OKs abortion, so political ideology is probably not behind this book.But it just doesn't seem to merit its ""groundbreaking"" subtitle."
1,"epiphany, or not?","It seems that this book either offers the reader an epiphany (unconditionally), or that it does not, with concrete reasons. Count me amongst the unepiphanied. I found that it did not really say anything relatable to my life. I did not find it groundbreaking."
1,one star is too many stars for this book,"Frankly, I didn't get it.The author makes a huge case for type 1 and type 2 abilities being our maturational building blocks, but about the only ability (which would be a type 1) he feels comfortable actually discussing is the ability to say ""no"". Well, I say no to this book. I'm not holding my breath for a revolution of any kind to come from this book. Save your time and your money.On the other hand, if you are looking for something to blame for something that went wrong in your life (like a failed marriage), you might enjoy this book"
1,Now what?,"Well, I read it. Now armed with all of this ""knowledge"", what the h-word do I do with it? I really don't feel any better off having read this than I would had I read a volume of Portuguese haiku (and I don't speak Portuguese)."
1,disappointed,"I believe I am a reasonably intelligent person, and I would consider myself interested in self improvement (I read this book), but I found it less than enlightening. The first half of it is, in my opinion, incredibly obtuse. Very difficult reading. The rest of the book was lighter in its tone, but of course built upon the first part.I found it disturbing that the author called this path of maturation ""God"". I also found the analysis of the ancient Greek mindset (based upon translations of the Odyssey and the Iliad) to read like a poor college term paper written during an all-nighter.I wish I could say that this book changed my life, but I can't. Here's its effect on me: I have a watch that has a picture of Donna Reed on its face. I now think of this watch as my maternal carrier."
2,Newly revised?,"If you are on some kind of Healthy plan and are thinking of using this book to help you plan your eating when you are not at home, think again. The last revision of the book was in 1991 and several of the Restarurants and Brands listed no longer exist. Of those that do, watch out. This book includes listings for menu items which no longer exist, or which were changes within the last few years.Unless this book is updated, this is not a good resource."
1,Too old to be of any use,"Almost nothing in this book is current enough to be helpful. You are much better off using the online sites of the food manufacturers and restaurants and, if necessary, doing the math to figure out how the carbs, proteins, and fats translate into food exchanges.Don't waste your money."
1,WAY Out of Date,I guess I didn't realize it was published in 1991. (17 years ago). $10.17 down the tubes. I guess I trusted when I should have researched a little more. My bad for not paying attention.
2,Old Data,"This is the second edition (1986 & 1991) but should have been updated four more times to be up to date. There are a lot of foods now on supermarket shelves that were not available 20 years ago as well as some things covered that are no longer on the market. The data that is there is helpful, but there are too many gaps to make this a good choice for someone needing real help today."
5,Awesome,"I have to agree with the last reviewer, this is one of the best punk CD's I own. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up, as well as their first release, City Lights that Lead the Way. My only complaint is that it's only about 16 minutes long, I pray their next album is a full-length CD!I'm revising this review just to state, for the record, track three is ""The Tragic Tale of Fate and Death"", not the ""Traffic"" tale..."
3,"Good story, sappy narration (AUDIO BOOK REVIEW)","While the bulk of this story is 4/5 star material, the author writes as if he thinks the reader cares about his personal life. As read by the narrator, this story is overdramatic and too touchy-feely. The author restores the listeners' opinion of him by reading a bit at the end of the story, but overall, it is too late. The narrator comes very close to killing the whole experience."
3,3 1/2 stars,"I've read several mountain climbing/Everest books lately and this is in the top half of that list. That having been said, as one reviewer noted, it was more interesting than gripping, and for all the ability to give a auto-biographical look at a world class climber, it didn't really capture the drama of the climb. Since reading about it is about as close as I'm ever going to get to doing it, I need something that makes me feel the cold and the wind and the struggle for air. This was more of a narrative retelling, and emotion is overly removed from the story.Everest is almost as much of a protagonist as Breashears himself, and it was indeed very interesting to read about the history, about the other expeditions, and about the call on the author that brought him to climbing as a life. It was enough, and I recommend the book without reservation, but I would say read ""Into Thin Air"" if you are looking for a more powerful and exciting retelling of an Everest climb."
3,A good psychology read,"This is as much a book about climbing Everest as it is an autobiography about a man's inner struggles. Would be a good read for a psychology class. The author gives great attention to detail and does a good job explaining the sport of mountain climbing to the novice.As you read about the people who climb Everest, you'll think: Why? And then you'll find the answer: Because it's there!I can summarize the book in two words: VERY HUMAN. Breshears is not afraid to tell you his strengths and weaknesses, nor is he hesitant to point out the same in others."
5,Excellent book,"David Brashears writes the way I imagine him to conduct his climbs and his shoots. That is, he is methodical, but not lacking in passion. He is careful and controlled, but also powerful and decisive. It is quite clear from his writing in this book that he has a deep respect for his fellow man as well as for the nature that gave him his beloved mountains. In addition to this, he respects the discipline and drive of those compelled to conquer the mountains, and he aspires, from childhood, to do the same. He seems to be a most impressive person, and his personal story is fascinating and authentic. I, for one, hope that he will continue to write, and to give a solid human voice to an otherwise anonymous visual medium."
4,Inspirational,"High Exposure by David Breashear, is about his life experiences that indulged him into attempting and doing the impossible. Breashear's passion for mountain climbing and hiking is described through his adventures in Colorado, Tibet and other parts of the world.Breasher's book is really good for people who are interested in reading inspirational books. David describes how he pushed his mind, body, and soul to its limits through his hikes and climbs around the world.One thing about High Exposure that wasn't eye catching dealt with David's childhood and what influenced him to climb. In his book he explains what made him develop a passion for climbing but with little detail. It makes the reader wonder why didn't he use the amount of detail described in his experience across Tibet? Overall the book was very motivational. After reading the book, you'll just want to overcome any obstacle in life."
3,Decent Read,"This is a very good book if you find the culture of mountain climbing as interesting as I do. If you are looking for something as gripping as ""Into Thin Air"" by Jon Kraukauer, you will probably be disappointed. This book is more of a autobiography of David Brashears and his adventures climbing and filming the world's greatest peaks. One section toward the end is devoted to the summit disaster on Everest. After reading ""Into Thin Air,"" it was interesting to get a different perspective on the disaster from someone who was there but not directly involved in the drama."
4,A Compelling Life Story,"David Breashears has led an interesting life, one that included summitting Mount Everest four times, usually using his skills as a cameraman more than a climber. This book covers the history of how, and why, he developed his skills in both film and climbing. Though sometimes sad, the honesty with which mistakes are admitted is refreshing. The book is well written and hard to put down."
5,Highly recommended,This book is hard to put down once you start to read it. You feel like you are watching the adventures of the author. Breashears takes a close look at himself and does not hesitate to describe his own faults and mistakes. Breashears gives addititional information and insight as to what went wrong on Everest in 1996.
1,TWO THUMBS DOWN,"Let's see, the decision-making and wisdom of Rob Hall and Scott Fischer are questioned, but the author sees nothing ridiculous about Sandy Hill's outrageous behavior? I agree with the earlier reviewer--there's something amiss with this book."
2,"Interesting, But Not Gripping","I must agree witht he reviewer who commented about the book being written by committee. The narrative is choppy and lacking not only key details, but also historical background. Because it's an autobiography, I don't necessarily think that it's fair to damn the book for being self-centered; it IS about him. I do feel, however, that the book needs better editing and a bit more self-examination.It's an okay addition to one's list of books about Everest expeditions - which I must admit, I've developed a morbid fascination with after recently re-reading ""Into Thin Air"". I wouldn't, however, use it as my primary source for information or impressions."
4,"OK , but not the Top of the World","The introspect into the life of a high altitude climber/cinematographer provided in this book is quite good. However the book labors on about the 1996 Everest season. While this may have been the author's attempt to deal with the tragedy, it comes off as another climber trying to cash in on the deaths of others. Granted it is far better than Krakauer's ""Into Thin Air"". I was hoping to read more about what it takes to be a world class climber. This book started to do just that then... it plunged into the death zone. It was a real struggle to finish once the 1996 episode was started. Over all a good read. Quite interesting early on."
5,Best of the Bunch,"Having read almost every book in print regarding Everest mountaineering in the 1990's, and many accounts of Himalayan and ""Seven Summits"" climbin in general, I consider this work one of the best. Breashears' experiences in the mountains are vividly recounted, including his participation in the 1994 tragedy on Everest. This account differs from those of other authors (like Jon Krakauer's solo work ""Into Thin Air"" and Anatoly Boukreev's ""The Climb"") most notably in being authored by an individual both ""one step removed"" from the tragedy itself, in the sense that Breashears was not himself in the eye of the storm, who nonetheless acted heroically in the face of developing need. Breashears is able to provide a ""third-party"" account which is telling without being judgmental; I highly recommend this book for anyone who has read other accounts of the '94 disaster."
3,"Fascinating in parts, but I wanted more","I found this autobiography of Breashears's exceptional and seemingly fearless life very compelling. However, I feel as if he was holding back somehow...although he digs into the psychological origins of his fascination with climbing, it seems as though some details are whitewashed or left out. What did he do with all those years unaccounted for? Were there jobs too mundane to be mentioned? And he describes his ex-wife as if she were a plaster saint. Noble, but seems unrealistic.He touches on his apparent need to be alone a lot, and alludes to good friendships such as his mentor Mr. Bass, and yet his offhand comment about relief from Bass's excessive chatter seems telling.It can't be argued his life is an amazing string of adventures. Their description alone makes the book worth it. But with more everyday details and self-examination, I feel this book could have been taken to another level, if you'll pardon the pun."
5,Everest Adventures,Purchased with Touching the Void and found this book very informative about Everest an many of the climbers that Joe Simpson mentions in his book. A good companion read to Touching the Void.
5,that makes two,"Wrong wrong wrong is sooooo right right right! I have the album (the CD is on my wish list) and it sounds just as good, if not better than it did when it was released over 20 years ago. I can't wait to hear it on CD. You must hear Patti and her girls on tracks besides the commercially successful Lady Marmalade, etc. to appreciate the depth of their talent. You'll be glad you got this one."
5,Classic album,"I wouldn't call this disco - to me, this is funky and at times rock-influenced soul music, with great songs and powerful singing. This marked the first appearance of ""Lady Marmalade"", a classic that has since been often covered but never bettered. An essential album!"
5,Wonderful stuff.,"For the most part, I'm not real fond of coconut. I didn't even know they made coconut syrup til I ate at a pancake place in Hawai'i. Mmmm, is that stuff good! My recommendation: buy a bottle right now."
1,Outragious,"Received this as a gift, and it was pretty good so I went online to order another bottle. I was astonished that anyone would have the gall to ask $21 for a regular size bottle of syrup. Seriously, this is crazy talk. Yeah, it's pretty tasty, but you would have to be an idiot to support these clowns in their attempt to pick your pocket like this. In Hawaii, the exact same article is about $5 and targets tourists, because anyone who truly wants this would just make some from scratch. It's not hard, the ingredients are easily available at any grocery store, and home made does not have the chemical aftertaste. It doesn't even take long to make, and you can easily have it done, fresh, if you start the same time you begin to cook your pancakes. You are not doing anything else except waiting for the tiny bubbles to form and start to pop, anyway."
3,NOT THE BEST,TTHIS PRODUCT ARRIVED CLUMPED UP INTO A THICK MESS ONLY SOLVED BY GENTLE HEATING AND THE FLAVOR WAS CERTAINLY LACKLUSTER. I WOULD NEVER REORDER THIS PRODUCT
5,Coconut Syrup,I ordered this coconut syrup as a reminder of my trip to the Big Island Hawaii. I am very pleased with my purchase as this syrup tastes exactly like the one I had while on vacation. I ordered 2 bottles and when I am out I will be ordering more of this syrup. It has a very pleasant coconut taste without being overpowering. Highly recommended!
4,almost there,I must admit that this cd is much better than I anticipated but wasn't quite at the 5 star level. This cd is great for anyone into the emo/indie rock scene. It sounds kind of like Get Up Kids meets Weakerthans. It took me two listens before I connected with #6(When is Pearl Harbor Day?) and a few listens more before I completely fell in love with the rest of the album. He has an amazing voice and each song sounds completely unique from the previous one. My only complaint is that the melody and words to the verses are awesome but they build up to a very basic chorus line that is repeated a few times to fill the chorus.
2,Casshan Volume 2,"I felt a little ripped off, when I got volume 1 and 2 together as an offer from Amazon.Com. Movie wise, volume 2 is actually exactly the same as volume 1, with volume 2 having the option for japanese dialog and Eng subtitle. Amazon could have at least indicated that in the ""description""."
5,The true spiritual of Karate and Martial Arts,This is another classic animation from my childhood. I've read some review complaining the weak figure of Casshan. A true and good martial artist has nothing to do with being Hugh and muscular. Casshan depicted the true beauty of martial arts and humility to sacrifice his human life to become the man and android hybrid to defeat BK1! Graphic may not be perfect but this is one of the classic that fans of animation shouldn't be missing.
2,Disappointing,"Well I waited for five and a half weeks for this DVD to come and was quite disappointed when it finally did. There are NO live concerts on it, its just an album with a few pictures and a 5 minute interview from Emmylou's producer/ex-husband! The Spyboy DVD is great though... I'm a great Emmy fan but this isn't very good..."
2,Old music and kind of boring,I love Olodum- however I found this DVD to bit a bit boring. I was expecting a better show- especially for the price.
3,BEWARE,"This is NOT the same JOHN FLYNN that put out Dragon and is from Philadelphia. Same name, not the same man. This is some Christian music man that lets people THINK they're getting the original John Flynn. And AMAZON refuses to refund my purchase. I've called 4 times, asking for them to send me a mailer to return the disc (which is still unopened), oh they SAY they will, and are ""oh so helpful"" over the phone, but then they ignore me and a mailer never arrives. I can see that happening once - but 3 times in a row??? Come on. Lousy customer service for a 10 yr + customer."
3,Take it for a holiday read,"My first book by this author, and I will look up some more of her titles. It is a pleasant reading, however it will not keep you up whole night, but you will like to get back to it the next day (at least I did), it is one of those books that you start to read and finish it quickly (not like next week or so). I like the mixing of the Scottish history into the plot, so one can actually learn something by reading this fiction."
1,This is Elizabeth Peters?,"I find it difficult to believe this pedantic, clumsily-written novel is by the same author as the delicious Amelia Peabody mysteries. Where is the wit, the good plotting? As outlandish as the Peabody books are, Peters writes so well in them that one gladly suspends disbelief. This book seems more like the effort of a not-very-talented undergraduate in a creative writing class. How disappointing! The narrator doesn't help; did she read the book before recording it? Inflections are inappropriate, the heroine comes across as a ditsy dame, and the male protagonist doesn't seem to know whether he speaks with an accent or not."
3,"So much information, there's no room for words!","Here comes the new kid on the block, attempting to overthrow Modern Chess Openings (MCO).Extremely dense, but chock full of new ideas.Prose explanations are rare.(Indeed,there are hardly any game references, which makes me wonder if the line is from Kasparov-Karpov, one of the games from the authors, computer analysis, or some guys from the local club!)But it has all the coverage you would expect of a one-volume opening book.Should this be the only opening book you buy? No. I find it more interesting to compare lines from MCO and NCO rather than blindly accept one book's version as the final one.But if you were to _only_ buy this book, you would not be disappointed. You would have to be prepared to play through the lines, and attempt to justify the author's evaluations yourself. You won't get much help from them."
4,Requires work on your part in order to be useful,"The general sentiment that I've read about this book is correct: there is little in the way of explicit explanations as to which line is better. What this means is that you will not be spoon-fed reasons why a given line is better for white or black; you'll have to do the legwork yourself through an analysis of the position.Frankly, I wouldn't have it any other way. People often complain that many books don't give ""the ideas"" behind openings, but the truth is that there are so many ideas that the truth of a position can't be summed up with a one-liner like ""White is better because of his active bishops"". It's only though analysis of typical positions that arise from your favorite openings that you will understand the complexities that arise from said openings.Before buying this book, I recommend playing until you consider yourself to be at an intermediate level in the fields of tactics, analysis and strategy before buying this book."
1,Nunn's nothing,I am an 1189 player who believes that Nunn's Chess Openings is worth nothing more than a paperweight. In volume two can we have some evaluation please? I found myself after move 14 ahead according to Nunn but didn't know why or where to move next.
3,Makes a Good Openings Reference Book,"I got this book just to have a book with some lines that were more up to date than ""The Ideas Behind the Chess Openings"" by Reuben Fine... This book is NOT for beginners or newly-achieved amateurs. Each openings chapter gives a short essay on the idea of the opening, but I would definitely have to direct anyone pursuing greater openings understanding to Reuben Fine's book, ""The Ideas Behind the Chess Openings"". Nunn's book makes a great reference book for openings, but one must realize that today's chess tournament life is constantly in pursuit of an opening that is more surprising or forgotten (thus newer or older respectively) than what was played in the few previous years...Don't take up a lot of your time trying to get through every move of even one chapter of this book. Just use it as a reference book."
4,I get the giggles,"I get the gigglesI totally get the giggle when I read all the bad reviews of this record. One guy even says ""Mick Ralphs is no Eric Clapton"" which is like ""Okay, I've only slept through every Eric Clapton record ever recorded."" No offence but what kind of irrelevant BS is that.And Ian Hunter is no Neil Sedaka...This record is not played well (like so many live recordings) it's not a stellar technical recording either. That said I would not trade this record for virtually anything. It's funny and irreverent and displays perfectly 1974 in a beautiful rock and roll time capsule. You either get it or you don't. It is a beautiful thing only because of it's imperfections and haphazard train wreck of a performance. I love virtually every second of this record and I hope people continue to explain all the reasons it's not good. They might just be right, but in too many ways to list they are also dead wrong.I still get the giggles... It rocks, it is rock (defined)"
1,I get the heaves,"There seems to be a great deal of controversy and backbiting over this one, and that is tragic, because this set is not worth all the commotion. The whole Ralphs/Clapton thing doesn't matter, because Ralphs wasn't that good, and Bender is even less adept. Hunter's voice is ragged, the whole set is sloppy, and it would seem that the only reason for releasing this thing was to fulfill a contractual obligation. Reviewers, if we must disagree with each other, let us do so respectfully. Let's review the album, and stop the character assassination. Are we not capable of better than that?"
2,So-so,"By the time this album was recorded, Mott was pretty well washed up, as this performance will attest. Mick Ralphs (who was no Eric Clapton) had departed, and Ariel Bender (aka Luther Grosvenor) proved to be even worse than Ralphs (this was before the arrival of Mick Ronson, who was far better than the other two combined). This album offers a tired band slogging its way through a ho-hum set. There is simply nothing here that Mott hasn't done better somewhere else, which makes this a rather uninteresting listening experience. Avoid this one."
2,Not that good,"There seems to be considerable controversy regarding this one. As an avid admirer of Mott the Hoople since their early days, I must confess that this set is somewhat disappointing. It is certainly true that the band had nearly reached the end of the line by the time of this recording, and much of the playing here was less than inspired. Ian Hunter talks too much throughout the set, and poor old Luther (Ariel Bender) Grosvenor proves that a hack by any other name is still a hack; he just doesn't seem able to adequately fill the gap left by the departure of Mick Ralphs. Pete Watts and Dale Griffin were still on board, and Morgan Fisher plays adequately, but the performances are rushed, sloppy, and seem to scream the fact that the members of Mott no longer really cared. In fact, this entire album seems to be mere ""product"", meant to fulfill a contractual obligation, a sad epitaph for a once-great band who simply threw in the towel."
4,Not that bad..................,"A tired band..yes A band still enjoying playing live....yes they never quite seemed at home with the success. I met them in poor but happy days, it became prettier, but even then as in this recording, the guts came out with all the emotions. Live double set from 1971 pre fame and then US post fame ( Bowie introducing) just emphasises the point. Some of my best nights, I will take this even tho its not the real biz"
3,Stop Talking and Play!,"Mott the Hoople was capable of writing catchy, powerful rock and roll, as well as interesting, melodic ballads. However, this live album falls short, due almost entirely to Ian Hunter's propensity to babble, often insultingly, for up to 30 seconds at a time. This serves as a major distraction to the music, which packs an impressive punch otherwise."
2,Not enough for a book...,"I was greatly disappointed with this so called book. To me it wasn't even worth it's binding. It lacked both content and detailed instruction. Sad, really."
2,Not very diverse,I did not find this book very diverse regarding hairstyles. It has a lot of variations of the same types of styles. Not good if you are looking for different types of braids.
5,Kansas Soars,"On their second comming, Kansas took Genesis, Yes and E,L & Palmer and gave the world Americans version: Song for America, with such energy and class that it stands as Kansas Masterpiece. One of the true Ecological Mind Set Rock Progresive Bands of the 70's. It's a Classic. Wow..."
4,"Even though it is a 25+ yrs recording, it is ageless","First of all, I very rarely give 5 stars to any cd, but if this were a 10 star rating, this would be a 8.5/10So why should you buy this cd?As stated in the title, it still holds up after 25 yearsIf you like Leftoverture and Point of Know Return, you will like this cdUnlike Leftoverture and Point of Know Return, in most places on the globe, you are unlikely to easily find this new or used in a cd store (Same with the brilliant live recording ""Two for the Show"")In some ways this may be the most progressive rock of all Kansas recordings"
3,Not the best album,"""Song for America"" is Kansas's 2nd album. I don't think its that great of an album. The first 3 songs on this album (I think) are the only songs that are worth getting. I don't like the last 3 songs on this album (not including the bonus tracks). If you are either a big Kansas fan or just want the full version of the song ""Song for America"", then you should get this album. I wouldn't recommend it if you are new to Kansas."
4,"Superior 70s Album Rock, Full of the Sounds of the West","Arguably the best album that Kansas ever put out, Song for America is quintessential 1970s album rock (no singles ever made the charts from this album). The album shows the distinct influence of roots-tinged country music on the stock rock music of the early 70s. The title track is certainly the best song on the album, despite its trite lyrics. It is the music that is the magic in this track as the listener can clearly hear all of the band's influences at work: classical, country, rock, and even a touch of the rural mysticism that would find its true voice inPat Methenybefore the decade closed.And, it's the best album cover Kansas ever had, and one of the most iconic album covers of all time, from a time when the album cover actually meant something."
4,american prog rock,"While I don't put Kansas on the same level of brilliance as bands like Genesis, Yes, or Emerson, Lake and Palmer, at least these guys are pretty good songwriters most of the time (unlike the Dream Theater stuff I was unfortunately exposed to earlier tonight- that's one band you should avoid at ALL costs).I will admit Kansas was probably ripping off Genesis and Yes a little bit to make this album back in the mid 70's, but despite that, these are some top notch vocal melodies and the instrumental sections are pretty good most of the time, if not very complex. Pretty good stuff.The title song has some interesting instrumental parts, and ""Lamplight Symphony"" has some gorgeous vocals. Good music from the small American prog rock scene."
4,Much better sound,"Epic/Legacy's reissue of Kansas' ""Song for America"" is a welcome one. The result is a crisper, punchier sound compared to the original CD release. Even my old ears can pick up some subtleties that seemed to elude me on the original. Some of these songs are available on other remastered releases, but it's still nice to have the whole album in remastered form. The additional tracks are novelties at best -- were there no unrelease studio pieces they could have included -- but the live version of ""Down the Road"" shows that the band could deliver the goods in concert as well as on record."
4,Kansas rocks!,"Kansas stood out as one of the top prog rock bands of the mid & late '70's and this was one of their best efforts. Kerry Livgren's guitar work was impeccable and Steve Walsh's vocals and keyboards gave this band their signature sound. A must for any Kansas fan, or other fan of that vintage of prog rock's collection. Play it loud!"
4,What musical power youth casts upon us!,"It certainly does! I grew up listening to these guys from the get go. Some of ""early Kansas's best albums besides this one is Masque,Audio Visions, & Point of Knowe Return."" Phils drumming can be matched by only one that I know & thats Neil Peart of Rush & I liken Steve's voice to Journeys Steve Perry but with a bit more punch. Kerry is a spectacular writer in his own right. This band should NEVER go away. There is fire lying within the heart & soul of this band & sincere melodic harmonies of all accords. I still see them every chance I get & you should too! Song For America , Lamplight Symphony, & Devils Game are my fav's here but the whole albums is some of KANSAS at their best!"
5,Emotionally stirring finale to the series,"Matt and Julie are approaching their first anniversary, and Julie, pregnant with their first child, couldn't be happier.Then one day, with a sense of freedom she knew she wouldn't have for much longer, she is in a car wreck that knocks her unconscious. Matt, concerned about possible injuries to the baby, signs the papers to go ahead and have the baby delivered 2 1/2 months early. As a result of being premature, the baby does not make it. Naturally Matt blames himself and Julie sinks into depression and goes back to her parents.I don't want to give away the ending! It's not as bad as you may think! A grande finale to a wonderful series!!"
5,Love the series!,I love the book it was real like someone could have been in your family that was going through that. When I have a little girl I would love her to read this series. I hope very little girl or adult reads these books.
5,wonderful,"After previewing the ""Jigglin George"" at their store in Gatlinburg I went on line and found this product.I ordered it immediately for 1/4 of the price. I realize that it is not exactly the same but it is awesome.My main reason for getting it was to help my husband with blood flow to help his diabetes. I enjoy it myself and my eleven year old grandson is hooked on it and wants his own for Christmas. I highly recommend this for everyone."
1,Management tips on a 3rd grade reading level,"Hands down, this is one of the most ludicrious books I have ever picked up.I was a little miffed when I opened the box and realized what I'd paid $11.95 plus postage for, but that was nothing. The print is large-some of the pages are only half full. What this an attempt to draw out what should have been a booklet? Or maybe not printed at all? The behavioral modifications presented can be picked up easily-positive reinforcement gets better results than punishment-how new is that idea? Or how about ""clearly communicate goals""? Good grief. If this is truly the state of management today I think I'll take my master's in psychology, write a repetitive, inane book and make a fortune. If your IQ is above 75, skip this."
1,Disappointed,"Upon receipt of TV plugged it in and got good audio but no video. Called Philips technical support, they tried but could not help. They told me that that was all they could do and the TV was ""out of warranty"". I returned the TV to Amazon for a refund (with no hassle). The net result of this experience was disappointment and the decision to purchase a TV retail and under warranty."
4,monoliths from Maslanka,"Jordheim et al. play musically and technically challenging music with equanimity. I particularly recommend this CD for its inclusion of the Song Book for Alto Saxophone and Marimba--a lesser-known work for an unusual ensemble, presented here by a fine pair of artists. The piece lacks the (admittedly few) problems I have with Maslanka's saxophone sonata, namely repetitiveness...indeed, Song Book is deceptively simple but well worth a listen."
5,This is an Awesome Senior Exercise Program!!,I actually found this exercise program very well laid out and easy to use. I would definitely would recommend this Senior Exercise Program to everyone I know!!! Thanks PTSue you are Awesome!! :0)Bed Mobility Kit
3,Great Accessory but not perfect,"I purchased this eye cup after the original eye cup disappered and I now know why. The eye cup does not click into place - it just slides on. I have knocked this one off already when placing the camera back into the bag. So, beware of this weakness. Other than that the Eyecup Magnifier is just what I needed. I don't wear glasses but my eyesight isnt' quite as sharp as it once was. This Eyecup really helps."
4,Fits the Bill,"The eye piece slid right in to my E-300 but not the way described on the instruction. Beautifull, works fine though. !!"
3,Limited Benefit,"The magnification difference on a Canon 20D is really pretty subtle. The quality of the glass magnifier is high and doesn't degrade or darken the view, but it really doesn't do a whole lot."
3,"works, but",This doesn't really magnify all that much -- I was somewhat disappointed that it didn't do more than about 2X. But it does make a slight difference. Difficult to decide whether or not to wear glasses -- depends on the shooting situation.
3,Gets in the Way for Tilt Swivel LCDs,"Easier to read the detail, but every time I want to move my tilt swivel LCD, it won't move until I edge the eyecup out of the way."
1,Virtually useless,"I can barely see a difference in E-500 viewfinder with and without ME-1. It even appears that the field of view in viewfinder is narrower with ME-1, that is when exposure info is in the view, the left side of the image is being obstructed by the ME-1 aperture. Very disappointing. I knew it was only x1.2, but now it's clear it's not even worth bothering..."
2,Not worth it,"I really didn't find this product helpful. The magnification is 1.2X which is really not much. Both my husband and I couldn't tell a difference from the original viewfinder. Olympus should make a higher magnification, and should build it into the camera (and not charge you $30+ extra). I plan on applying my refund to an expodisc instead (this is a product that helps with white balancing)."
3,I don't notice much difference,"This review essentially repeats what some of the earlier ones have said: I don't notice much difference with this eyecup. The information is a little more difficult to read along the side of the viewfinder, but not distractingly so. The viewfinder works fine with my glasses, but then, so did the original one. No complaints, but no distinct recommendation, either."
2,Not worth the money,"Quality wise this item, like everything else Olympus, was high in quality, fit and finish. However, it did not provide enough magnification to make it worth $40. The image seen through the viewfinder was only slightly magnified. Maybe in the future they will make one with more magnification."
5,great upgrade from std. eyecup,"I bought this eyecup to improve my view and ability to focus accurately with OM manual lenses.It does exactly that. In response to some other reviews I read prior to my purchase...my view of the exposure information on the right side of my e510 is just fine - littleto no loss of view. Also, the eyecup stays on very securely...more so than the original, despitesome reviewers claiming it fell off easily. I feel this should be std. issue with all e-seriescameras. Very pleased. Unless you need to push your eye right into the eyecup, it worksjust fine with glasses as well."
2,Really doesnt make a big difference,"I bought this because I thought it would improve my viewfinder of my Olympus E-500 but the difference is minimal and it's harder to use with glasses. Also this doesn't attach as firmly as the original eyepiece, so I lost mine after a couple of months."
4,"Olympus me-1, some benefit","Hi,I use an Olympus E300 and I've found the me-1 magnifier somewhat helpful when using my old manual focus lenses; I can still focus them without using the magnifier, but it's more trouble and takes longer. I haven't used it in the field, where it might be more beneficial because conditions aren't as optimal as the testing of it I have done (in good light with no time constraints).I wear eyeglasses and as many eyeglass wearers have pointed out, when using the me-1 you have to shift your head a little to see the right most side of the viewfinder where the aperture, etc. information is displayed. I suppose you could get used to this."
1,Don't bother,"I just got it. I can see absolutely no difference in the size of the image in my viewfinder. The thing DOES seem to help me with sharper manual focusing..by JUSSST a little bit. But that's not worth 40 bucks to me. Right back it goes.Think carefully about getting this. 40 bucks is a lot of money to throw down on a piece of plastic, particularly one that does almost nothing for you."
3,Game Boy Advance Strawberry Shortcake Sweet Dreams review,"This game was fun. Cute graphics, easy mini games, etc. However....we beat this game in about 45 minutes. 45 MINUTES!!! Definitely rent this game first or buy it used....because it is definitely NOT worth the full price."
5,Fantastic adn LOL funny,"Okay, when I first started watching this movie, I thought that it was going to be a weak series and I was a skeptic. After My friends and I finished the video, we were laughing and thought that the series was greater than Sailor Moon (our original fave).Now I'm hooked adn I want to see more. At one point in the movie, it got so fimilar that we quoted it and fell on the floor laughing. If you are a new anime fan, get this movie. Trust me, you will want to watch it about a hundred times over."
5,Absolutely Fabulous!!!!,This was a great video. I loved every minute of it. My best freind gave me this video and the soundtrack (vol. 1). I love it all. The tape and the music. The theme Rinbu Revolution is spectacular. This video is definetly worth it! Especially if your an Anime fan. All the characters are fun and unique. There is great intrigue throughout the whole video.
5,This show will change your life!,"I've seen this tape subtitled and dubbed, and both times, it inspires me to... well, to revolution. For three years, I was a loyal Sailormoon fan, but thanks to Utena, I've seen the light. ^_^The scenes, the music, the direction... it's all superb. Even with the flatness of the dub, all of the intrigue, mystery and beauty of this show is left intact and pierces your heart like the sword of Dios. ^_^ Do whatever you can to see this series."
3,It is O.K.,"I own a couple of these chairs. Be very careful putting it together that you have the screws perfectly aligned, or else it will strip out the aluminum screw base. Since the arms hold the back of the chair to the base, this will cause the chair to become ""Wobbly"" if not firmly seated.Once together, It will last at least a year of daily use before the padding is worn out. It is worth the $65 I paid for it."
5,Up and Coming Pop that Rocks!,This is a CD w/ enough variety to keep it spinning all the way from rim to rim. Classic rock guitar and a strong lead VOCAL make it ear candy- but not too sweet (too pop) and not to tart (too grunge.) If you can catch a live show- DO IT! The first band I've seen in awhile that actually sounds like their recording-ie no production addicts here. PS- Don't miss the hidden track if you've ever been a traveling musician.
2,A Modern Day Western Disappointment,"The 1st thing you need to know about Silver Rock is that this is set in the 1950's not the 1850's. Thus except for a hidden sniper scene, the book is pretty much bereft of any gunplay. There are a couple of good fistfight scenes. After reading the first few scenes of the book, I was reminded of the Spencer Tracy film ""Bad Day At Black Rock"", a great movie which is also a modern western. Both book and movie deal with a war veteran returning to find something about the family of a dead brother-in-arms. The similarities end there. Silver Rock deals with Tully Gibbs' efforts to mine a valuable but forgotten claim with his friend's father. There is little action and a standard subplot involving a girl, a jealous boyfriend and Tully's guilty secret. All in all, a disappointing effort from a Western Master."
5,Dogloo Door,"Easily installed and performs better than I anticipated. I would recommend this to anyone that has a dogloo, as it provides for a better environment for their pet."
1,Ballroom tango is not Argentine tango,"This video teaches ballroom tango, which does not look like or sound like or has anything in common with real Argentine tango. Don't be confused by ballroom teachers who don't know the difference."
5,Tango,"This helped me and my fiance prep for our dancing lessons. It ended up saving us a ton because we had the basic steps down. I love it and dancing with him was fun, buy it and a few dollars you can't beat that."
3,Final CD not what was originally advertise by the label,"The original listing for the tracks on 90124 on the UK label's (Voiceprint.co.uk) website (which still has not changed)had 14 tracks, only three of which had final versions on 90125: Hold On, Changes & Owner Of A Lonely Heart. The final version of the CD that was released has only 11 tracks, 7 of which have final version on one or more YES albums. I was very excited about hearing all those unrelease tracks that never made it to a final studio album, but that ended up not being the case. Most of the songs that were released on 90124 are demos, the sound quality varies from pretty good to poor. Still a must for Yes/Trevor Rabin fans, however a disappointment when you consider what it was suppose to be."
3,Gold Figaro Link,The picture makes it look larger than it really is. Find for a woman but not as a man's chain.
1,It doesn't fit my car,This product didn't fit my car and interfered with the brake caliper on my vehicle. Upon contacting the manufacturer they admitted to the problem on some production models which really surprised me. If you know of a potential problem then why are you selling a product knowing this. A true mystery to me. I must say though that Amazon provided excellent customer service in this matter and resolved the problem to my satisfaction.
5,Buckner scores again......,"just when you think you might be getting a handle on him he throws another killer curve (how refreshing). all one track intended for a ""whole listen"". different, experimental, brave...... multiple spins required."
1,I'm not going to take it,A one-track CD forcing me to listen to all or nothing? Not in my collection! I bought this recording years ago and listened to it once. I just pulled it out again and whisked it into the trash along with some of my CDs that have 87 bonus tracks (each being one second of silence). The quality of the music? Who cares! I would turn OK Computer or Dark Side of the Moon into coasters if they were programmed with 1 track or 99.
4,Richard Buckner Visits Spoon River,"The new Richard Buckner album 'The Hill' is a departure from his previous three; instead of writing the lyrics and music, Buckner set poems from Edgar Lee Masters' classic 'Spoon River Anthology' to music (and in some cases composed instrumental pieces inspired by the Spoon River poems). I had heard of the book but had never read it, so I picked up it and the CD both today. While I miss Buckner's lyrics, the fragmented phrases almost in code that I don't always comprehend but do always enjoy, the melancholy that runs through most of his work is amplified here; for each of Masters' poems is the voice of one of Spoon River's dead, buried on the Hill, encapsulating their life and how they met their fate. The music and Buckner's voice are enthralling. I leave him with four stars based on half-a-dozen listens today but I wouldn't be surprised if it grows to a five-star album with time."
3,Moderate,"It is fun to travel around in accurate celestial maps. Take a trip from Earth to Mars in a few minutes, etc. The physics are amazing. Unlike other games, the ship actually has to use thrusters in order to change direction. In other games, ships in space could somehow turn like an Earth-based fighter jet. In this, once you start moving, you could turn around and, without thrusters, travel backwards through space.The main problems with the game is overscripting and its very steep learning curve. The missions are WAYYYY too long, and for beginner commanders, it is very difficult to make the craft function properly. I'd recommend this game only if you're willing to put a lot of time into learning the controls and tactics."
3,Good for hard core space flight enthusiasts,"If you own a lot of space flight games, this will be an addictive addition to your collection. In many ways revolutionary, it is entirely more challenging than most of its counterparts.But challenge ain't all it's cracked up to be. There's no absorbing 'universe' here in which to get lost. Campaigns do build on each other, to an extent--and get very much harder--but there's no sense of real, plotted progress.Purists would undoubtedly find little difficulty with this. The stuff's in the time spent at joystick, they would argue. But for me, I'd gladly sacrifice a tiny bit of 'revolutionary physics-based modeling' for a reason to care."
1,Disco or Jazz?,"I love jazz, but I hear more dated disco funky beats here, than anything interesting. What kind of true jazz fan would really go for this, if youl ike disco and funk, than ok, buy this, but other reviewers are being misleading when they refer to this as jazz, I bought this based on the 5 star reviews. I guess you can't trust amazon.com reviewers, they'd give anything four stars. I understand there are a few nice solos here, but why the disco beat, that just cheapens everything. CHEAP, 2nd rate bargain basement jazz, with more disco than jazz, and yes I like Miles Davis' B*tches Brew, so it's not that I don't get the concept of fusion. There is just a little too musch crap fused with not enough jazz."
5,his way with words are magical,My way of looking at life changed completely as I read this book. I even learned to love doing the dishes!
2,Pocket book,was expecting a real book. This book was about the size of a matchbox. The amount of text would fit on 1-1.5 normal sized pages. Not what i expected.
5,Extraordinary guidance,"This book is amazing. Peace is indeed possible, and it begins with each of us. This book helps us step by step to get nearer to the practice of Peace. Meditation, living life itself, with this guidance, becomes a joyful peaceful dance. I heartily reccomend this book to all! May your life be full of mindful joyful moments."
3,A good introduction to living mindfully,"If you've never read anything by Thich Nhat Hanh and you are interested in and open to the concept of living mindfully, then this book is a nice, easy introduction. If however, you are familiar with Hanh's work and/or Buddhist philosophy, this book may well be too simplistic. I didn't find it nearly as meaningful as some of Hanh's other books, particularly The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching."
4,Nice book,Book arrived earlier than expected and in good condition. Found a lot of Thich Nhat Hanh's books to say a lot of the same things. Recommend to potential buyers.
5,Peace is every step,very short and easy to read with a profound messege. It teached me how to look at life and how to have peace in every step of life. Buy it
5,Simple yet Powerful,"""Peace is Every Step""is very simple to understand yet has many powerful themes and ideas. A perfect book for someone who needs something to help them figure out how to reflect on the many different aspects of their life."
5,A great meditation book,"This book is not too big, and not boring. Out of all the books I have read on meditation and all his books, I would rate this one my favorite especially for beginners. You can read it no matter what your faith, and it will be helpful, even it your not a beginner, it is a noce suplement. I have bought over 20 of these books for others who are trying to learn to meditate, and they can't sit still. I highly recommend this book, and a lot from this author, but not all his books."
5,An excellent intro to mindfulness,"This book was given to me as a gift from a friend. It was a fitting means of delivery. It truly was a ""gift"". Thich Nhat Hanh has a wonderfully clear talent for writing and communicating his thoughts and ideas clearly and simply. Having read many books about mindfulness and meditation, I found this to be among the best. As a Christian, I found many of his methods for practicing mindfulness daily very practical and useful in deepening my own spiritual connection with God and the many people I interact with daily. It's a beautiful book. He is an eloquent champion of living with compassion, conviction, and humility."
3,Can't wait to finish this,"Peace is Every StepI haven't read this thoroughly yet, just scanned it.It looks wonderful......arrived in good shape andpromptly. Thanks for asking."
5,Beautiful book,"This book is highly spiritual, easy to read, and one that is hard to put down, when something else needs to be done."
5,An enlightening book,"This is a simple, easy to read, down-to earth book about how to achieve peace in our individual lives and thus in the world as a whole through learning to be in the now. The book is composed of short passages, which makes for enjoyable, relaxed reading. Thich Nhat Hanh advises us about how to obtain mindfulness in various everyday circumstances, for example, while eating, walking, in connection with answering the phone, driving and while mowing grass with a scythe. He advises us that there is no path to peace, peace is the path. Each of us must achieve peace here and now with our smile, words and actions. Everything we want is right here in the moment. He also includes useful advice about how to cope with our anger through a walking meditation. The author's love for humanity and all of life pervades the pages of the book, which includes a poem he himself wrote that helps us understand how we are all connected, are all one."
4,I enjoyed this book,"This is the first book from Tich Nhat Hanh that I've read. It was a recommendation from a friend and colleague at work. I really like the techniques that are discussed at start of the book: breath in (relax your body), breath out (smile). That is amazing advice - seriously! Anyways, the book makes you feel a bit more guilty for being ""privileged"" in the unfair world in which we live. Now, what do you do. I totally agree with the statements of ""trying"" to understand, but really who understands ""why"" the world is in the shape it is in. Tich Nhat Hanh tells you his view, but he is human. He doesn't mention God or the universe in his book. So, don't look for a resolution to your spiritual endeavor in this book. Instead, look to become a more compassionate and contemplative human being."
3,Awful Sound Ruins A Great Album,"Talk about your lousy mastering jobs...Most of the songs are so compressed that they sound like they are in mono. Aside from that, the songs, singing amd playing are all noteworthy. Too bad the asking price is in the rarified atmosphere."
2,:(,Good book about something many people don't like to talk about because it's so dark sounding. People do good things and stay outta trouble...that's all. 2 star just because...I don't like these kinds of subjects but needed to write a report about it...
4,Good information,"This book provides very good information. It is a book that is well done, is thorough and has been well researched."
4,My thoughts,"Good information covering both side of the argument, I did however find it a little repetitive once you have read around two thirds of the book."
4,quality reading about PTSD,"I just presented a couple of Power Point presentations in two University classes on PTSD. Though I didn't reference his journal production or his books, I find that reading this book pulled many things together after doing the above. He is at Emory now, going there from Yale.The hardback could have used some editing. He repeats himself almost verbatim many times, which might help somebody who just picks into stray chapters.Anyway, you might want to check out a PPT he presented March 2007.http://braininstitute.vanderbilt.edu/Vanderbilt_March07_BremnerLecture.pptHe frequently studies how trauma affects brain structures."
3,Didn't quite live up to its potential,"This book could have been so good. There are moments where it becomes richly profound and genuinely moving - such as when Doyle considers the place of his son in his life, heart troubles and all - but then he slips back into what felt like simple hero-worship of the (admitedly talented) surgeon who saved his son's life.I really wanted to love this book, but when I finished I felt more disappointed than truly moved."
5,Walk in his shoes before criticizing!,"This is definitely a beautiful tribute to his son AND his surgeons!To those who may feel as though the author has resorted to ""simple hero-worship"", I must tell you that you will NEVER fully understand the author's position. He does, in fact, worship those surgeons. He puts them on a pedestal and will never be able to thank them enough.I know this because those same surgeons, (Dr. McIrvin, Dr. Iguidbashian, Dr. Hagup) also performed surgery on my son who was born with the same heart defect of Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome. They are the epitome of pure genius.I bought this book in part because it IS a tribute to those men. How would you feel about someone who gave your precious child the gift of life and hope?Thank you, Mr. Doyle, for this moving story of hope, strength, inspiration, and admiration."
5,The books only get better,"I saw this book listed on your suggested items several months ago. I had purchased several of Brian's previous books and always found them uplifting and thought provoking. It was only a few days after I purchased this book, The Wet Engine that my wife had a heart attack so it brought home to me the frail qualities of our most important engine. Doyle writes with a very sensitive but yet funny style that kept me turning the pages even though I needed sleep. As his books go, I would recommend this one as a leap forward in his style and insight.My highschool writing teacher told me that you need to write about something you know or are close to. Evidently Doyle understands this as all his writing is deeply personal and close to home."
5,very unexpected,"wow can't say I was ready for this book, nothing like I expected. seems the whole book was about sex. well written of course but not what I was expecting. this is the first book of Ray Garton I've read. I will look for more of his books. Ive already recommended this book to several people. It is a good read , I couldn't put it down. makes you think about the people around you for sure."
4,RAY does it again,reading everything RAY GARTON writes and never seems to amaze me...until i read his next book...this was great read from cover to cover as always and you won't be disappointed...especially if you are a RAY fan or love horror!!!!
1,The New Neighbor of Silly Town,"What do you do when a demon moves in next door? Especially when it is in the guise of a beautiful nymphomaniac? Apparently, everyone turns into an idiot. This story was not believable at all and I frankly quickly got tired of people succumbing to the demon over and over. Okay, so maybe that goes to the strength of the demon, but does it make an interesting story? It was just silly."
5,Still reading,Love it so far. This is my first book by His Holiness. I feel it's a good start to know his background story before reading his other books.
5,Great book kids,I bought this for my daughter and think it is great. My son loves it too. I really like that it has alot of fun things to try to learn about the wind. Great book for 5-8 year olds!
1,1 star only because zero star is not a given option,"I would give this movie a negative star rating if it were an option.First of all here is one crucial thing that I missed when I ordered this poor excues for a movie:""Language: Japanese""When you go to the ""language / subtitle menu"" the only option that you get for English is subtibles ONLY!I hate having to read a movie!The audio track only offers two versions of Japanese.The rating on this is also VERY misleading it is rated ""X"" Why it is rated X I have no idea, it should be NC17 at best, it does not show ANYTHING explicit at all for the X rating.The Title is also a mystery to me there was no ""Party""This movie would not even qualify as a bad B movie!I paid$4.99$2.49 + Shipping & Handling:-----$7.48 TotalFor a used version and feel like it was $7.48 too muchDo not waste your money or time with this poor excuse of a movie!"
3,Beware of the digital SPDIF optical output,"Even though the card is 7.1-capable, the SPDIF output is only 2-channel. It seems that this is the case with all these cheap surround ""SPDIF"" cards.If you don't plan to use the digital output, then this is a good card."
4,Great Card,"The card can fit into a slim case. I've used both the optical and stereo outputs and they provide great sound. I had some software issues with the mic settings, however."
3,Interesting book probably about the Door Fellowship,"I found the book interesting. I can't say I believe in the Christian curse concept, nevertheless, I found it curious. I read the book because Dennis Cramer attended the same church I attended for more than 20 years, The Door Fellowship in Williamsport, PA. I found his detail of what happened at the hands of the pastors to be incredibly fascinating and sadly I believe it.He details fairly well the symptons of a church growing off center. If you are in a spirtually abusive church you will find the book helpful."
4,breaking christian curses,"this is an excellent book. very informative. i knew that christian curses existed, but many times people used the verse: an undeserved curse does not allight to try to disprove the fact that i could be affected by this. the author gave many biblical examples and verses to back up his side of the story and also gave many personal examples and other examples. i think this would be a good book to read if you suspect or know that others are cursing you and also a good book to give to another person that doesn't realize that they are cursing people. it will either open their eyes or give them better ideas, so it could help or make them worse. i reccomend this book especially to anyone who has loved church and christians for a long time and suddenly dreads going anywhere near them."
3,Good Book,"I have had this happen to me, so I am enjoying this book. Although it is sold on Elijah List for $15.00. So why the big price hike here?"
4,Wargasm: Graphics Powerhouse!!!,"I almost guarantee you will love this explosion filled all out battle that encompases modern and near future battle. Tanks, choppers, and decked out troops lead the charge in this awesome eye-filling explosion that will keep you glued to the chair and your eyes fixed on the screen."
5,template bit,"Bit worked well for my specific need which was cutting out a template hole for a router plate in a table saw top. I could see where a longer fluted bit would be beneficial for other template work. Bit was sharp, cut well and was well behaved."
4,another good one,"this is another good noir, mabye not as good as the earlier ones, but good all the same"
4,All Star Line-up!,"Arrangements by Oliver Nelson. Sidemen include Chick Corea, Dave Pike, Jimmy Heath and Carmell Jones!"
5,A Rockin' Gem!,Johnny Winter / Captured Live! : All familiar songs done to the max by the great Johnny Winter. It don't get much better than this. Five Stars.
4,Some great rock and roll guitar!,"This is not a very well known album, but it really showcases Johny Winter's talent. This was Johnny at his electric best. An added treat is Floyd Radford on second guitar. Floyd really blazes on Bony Morony. I had the chance to see this particular Johhny Winter band back in 1975 and they blew the house down. This album captures most of that spirit."
5,Totally Rockin' Wild Greatness,"Johnny cuts loose from the opening bars with his signature high-energy blues-rock. This was recorded from some huge live shows on the West Coast and the quality is very good. He plays a fair amount through a stereo chorus which adds a nice touch. Every track is played with the full out energy of a headline centerpiece. If this don't get you rockin' then nothing will. I recommend this instead of coffee in the morning, higher volumes preferred."
4,A fun read!,"I've used name-your-baby books and websites to help me name cats, so I was glad to get this. Even if I never take a name from it for a future cat, it's still an interesting, very entertaining read. Besides, the book may help to pique your ideas on naming, considering it gives most actual meanings and goes beyond: ""Spencer - For a cat that never leaves marks! ""Duvet - A cat that always seems to be on the bed! ""Livingstone - You'll always find him eventually."" I would've liked male/female names to be grouped as such, but I admit that wouldn't have worked since many names are for both. Also, the black-and-white cat on the cover is enjoyable to see! I wonder what he/she was named."
3,Not their Best,"This is by far Versus's worst album. (Keep in mind, all their other albums are fantastic) Everything sounds good on here, but most of the songs are lacking in one way or another when compared to any of their other albums. 'Stars are Insane' 'Secret Swingers' and '2 Cents plus tax' are all great albums. Versus won't blow you away when you first listen to them since their approach is not unique, but they do it better than most. I'd give 4-5 stars for all of their albums but this one.Unfortunately this album sounds like a band going through the motions. There are a few great songs on this: ""Play dead"" and ""Shangri-La"" are great... and ""mermaid Legs"" and ""walkabout"" are good as well. Since its been 5 years since this, I'm curious to hear the next Versus album...I hear that there will be one"
4,EASY USE,HAD THIS MORTGAGE CALULATOR BEFORE. GOOD PRODUCT WITH EASE OF USE.LIKED FOLDING COVER BETTER THAN THE SLIDE ONE IT COMES WITH NOW.
5,Every Loan Officer/Mortgage Broker should have this.,"I should have searched for this on Amazon first. I purchased this after finding out that the one I had was like learning calculus all over again. Enter this then 2nd Function that and keystrokes up the kazoo before getting any answers. The Master IIIX is a breeze. Enter your loan amount, your interest rate then your term and you immediately get your monthly payment, PITI and even your 5y I/O loans in quick easy. Get this. You will know what I mean."
5,Great,"This is about the best calculator for mortgage professionals I have ever found. You don't have to be a financial genuies to understand it's features and the booklet that comes with it lays out almost all mortgage scenarios. It's so easy to use and you don't waste a lot of time learning to use it. If only it could generate leads, it's all you will ever need."
2,War and romance rage on west of the Mississippi River!,"The Civil War in the west builds into an orgy of destruction and death while the Kimbrough family fight for their very survival. The second novel in the Kimbrough trilogy rolls along as Quantrill's Raiders rip through Lawrence and Jo Shelby's cavalry battle on in Misssouri and Arkansas against Federal troops. If you enjoy vivid battle scenes and a you are there sort of experience then you'll enjoy this eye-opening view of true battles and campaigns fought in the Trans-Mississippi region. Despite the raging war that envelopes them, the fictional Kimbrough's fight on and cling to the last vestiges of love and family. Please give my novels a try. The author- Randal L. Greenwood"
1,Frost/Nixon was Pathetic and poorly writen,"This so called movie was all about David Frost and what he supposedly went through in the process of interviewing President Nixon. It was a real yawner. The responses of Nixon was not what was on the original footage, it was all taken out of contex, mostly just fiction, on what could have turned out to be a good film. Nixon was portrayed as an uncontrolable vilan, which was not reflected on the original footage of the real interviews. This film made both Frost and Nixon seemed out of step with reality of the times."
2,"Watergate Down.....,",Like a rabbit caught in headlights: check out Nixon in the real interviews.This film told me nothing I didnt already know; those who know nothing of Nixon will come to this with eyes wide open.Langhella obviously did his homework well; Sheen was Blair was Frost.Pointless really.
4,Always a good storyteller,"It took me a while to get to this movie. Living thru those days was enough. But Howard does engage us, and gets us to take another look at a fascinating time."
5,FRANK LANGELLA,"I AM A GREAT FAN OF FRANK LANGELLA. I HAVE ENJOYED HIS ACTING CAREER SINCE HE WAS A YOUNG MAN IN THE MOVIE""DIARY OF A MAD HOUSEWIFE"". HE DID AN EXCELLENT JOB STARING AS PRESIDENT NIXON. HE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS, AND I ONLY HOPE HE CAN MAKE MORE MOVIES IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THANK YOU AMAZON FOR THE EXCELLENT SERVICE.BILL K."
4,Great Movie!,"I had to watch this for a class, and ended up getting pretty into it, it is fascinating and historically accurate. The actors are great and it keeps you entertained. It is worth watching."
3,"Seemingly a dry movie, but actually quite good","1. On face value, most will find the thought of watching something about Nixon a very boring prospect. However, this is a well made movie with solid acting, especially via the actor portraying David Frost.2. As always with any film of this type, there will always be debates on the interpretation of the historical facts. With that being said, this is a well worth movie to spend one's money and time on."
3,Interesting during the interview portions,"Some spoilers below:This film takes a while to get going, focusing on a number of minor participants in the real-life drama surrounding interviewer David Frost's attempts to get interviews with Nixon a few years after his fall from grace. One has to be patient for a good 45 minutes or so, and then things start happening.Once Frost starts drilling Nixon about his Watergate involvement and his incursions into Cambodia, the disgraced former president reveals his stubborn side and his belief that presidents are actually above the law. That Nixon does not remember a lengthy rant on the phone to Frost shows either that he's drinking too much or he's getting confused. Either way, Frank Langella does a fine job of showing his deterioration and disorientation.And then it winds down and it's over. It's informative about our political history, but that's about it."
2,Somewhat Over The Top...,"Frank Langella turned in a good performance, but he was by no means truly 'being' Richard Nixon. The stereotypical image of Nixon as the hunched over, brooding character has been done so many times before, that it would be interesting to see someone really attempt to play him as he really was.That being said, it was entertaining at times and the actors did a good job. However, many liberties were taken with history and it wasn't all quite as it was protrayed. Just be prepared to see a very loosely based portrayal of actual history. In reality about 2.5 stars for me."
5,The Infamous Nixion Interview That Shocked The World.,"Politically intriguing as the film and its actors really have captured the mood of the 70's after the Watergate incident. The film pretty much portrays very closely (if not exactly) to the original Frost/Nixon tapes although in the film, it does not go into vivid detail on every topic that was originally discussed in the real interview but that is hardly a flaw for a great film. The casts of the film did brilliantly portraying figures of the past, most notably Frank Langella as Nixon and Michael Sheen as Frost. Despite the lack of action sequences, this film surprisingly managed to have kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole screening as the suspense between Nixon and the outside world was somewhat very sad. Overall, I've enjoyed this film and would recommend it to those who share the same political fascination with Nixon and/or Watergate such as I."
5,Great film,"""Frost/Nixon"" is a very well done film directed by Ron Howard that explores the post-Watergate interviews of Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) conducted by British television host David Frost (Michael Sheen). The film chronicles Frost's desperate attempts to land and finance the interviews, as well as his poor preparation for the first three sessions, which are completely monopolized by Nixon. Frost finally gets his act together by the time it's time to discuss Watergate, and the interview ends up being one of the most successful pieces in all of television history.I really enjoyed the film. Excellent performances by Sheen and Langella are supported by a wonderful cast that includes liver Platt, Sam Rockwell, and Kevin Bacon. I definitely recommend this film to any political junkie."
3,"RON HOWARD, OPUS 19","***1/2 Ron Howard is a director who's not thought highly of by some of us. You will vainly search for a personal thematic map in his filmography. But Ron Howard knows how to please the audience and his movies are mostly successes. I respect that because the public can not always be wrong. As for Frost/Nixon, it's a very good movie that leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. Simply because it reflects one of the main problems of our era: success, in terms of public recognition and financial terms, is always rewarding the swankiest and the less deserving one at the expense of the demanding or simply the most intelligent one. Recommended."
4,Great go-to cookbook for last minute entertaining!,"I love this cookbook! With easy to follow directions and affordable ingredients that are easy to find in your local grocery store it's perfect for anyone who likes to entertain on a whim! The recipes/menus are written in a clear, concise manner that is easy to follow along with."
3,good recipe for carrot cake,"I haven't really tried any of the theme party recipes, but there is a fabulous recipe for carrot cake that is almost foolproof."
4,"A good CD, but . . .","Although I liked it, I have to say that Enemy Glory Darkly Blessed is better, if only because the songs have grown and matured. If I hadn't heard Enemy Glory Darkly Blessed first I might have given this one a higher rating. It's an earlier version of that album. They are both good listens if you like hard rock with more than a touch of fantasy, but Enemy Glory Darkly Blessed is everything Enemy Glory is and more."
5,Excellent history of America's addiction to drug prohibition,"This is a must for anyone who wants to understand how we got into our counter productive War on Drugs. Every section has suggestions on how to proceed, and nearly none of them have been implemented in the decades since this book was written. Shame on America for ignoring pragmatic solutions."
5,The Best Book on US Drug History,"As the other reviewers say, this book is hands down, the best book on drug history available. Unlike other books about the history of drugs and drug policy (i.e., Musto), this book is not dry. It covers most drugs, including licit drugs (which is very important), and this man has great insight. This is the right way to write about drug policy. I have no idea why this book was never reprinted; it is truly the best drug book that exists."
5,Great Book,I read this book in the early '80s. I say that it helped me survive my period of drug experimentation. Now as a father I don't endorse the use of drugs but I do recommend this book so that the reader could make an informed choice.
5,As described!,Bought it for my 8 year old son's birthday gift. The wallet was as described and came to our home on time.
3,vinyl replacement dog door for Baux'r by Igloo Dog House,"A good product for the price. The door is easy to attatch, made of good quality durable vinyl. The only drawback is that it is not wide enough. There are gaps of about an inch on the right and left side. The wind can get in but it will keep out snow and rain...the main reason I bought it.My 10 lb. puppies don't seem to have the knack of pushing through it yet to go in/out ...but neither do they like to use the doghouse much in the winter.MY RECOMMENDATION:Maybe it would be better for a truly outdoor type dog breed who spends more time in a doghouse and needs the protection."
4,Great Album,This is some good modern jazz. The drummer is excellent. He shows some amazing skills. The same goes for the bass player and saxophonist. They're very good improvisationalists.
5,We Love This Thing!,"It was great. I used 3 lbs. of chocolate (Nestle Toll House MILK Chocolate Chips) & 1 1/2 cups of Wesson veg oil. I melted the chips & oil in the microwave, poured it in the machine and it worked right away with no problems. You couldn't even taste the oil. I served many things to dip but the large marshmallows & strawberries were the biggest hit! I have a 5, 3, & 1 year old who all had fun dipping.Clean up wasn't bad, all parts go in dishwasher. The only problem was what to do with the leftover chocolate."
3,Rival CFF5 Chocolate Fondue Fountain,"The fountain worked fairly well, but the chocolate only really poured out on one side. It definitely didn't look like the pictures, where the chocolate poured out smoothly and evenly on all sides. But otherwise, it did work well enough for dipping and the chocolate itself stayed melted throughout the night. It didn't get lumpy or anything. All in all, you get what you pay for. If you're using it for a party, it's fine; if you want it for a formal event like a wedding, it's probably better to rent a professional one."
5,Rival Chocolate Fountain Best for the price,"I used the Rival Chocolate fountain over the Christmas Holidays on two separate occasions. The Rival Chocolate fountain was easy to assemble, use and clean. The directions were simple and easy to follow. The Rival Chocolate fountain was operated for a minimum of 3 hours each time. The chocolate flowed flawlessly. While cleaning is a little messy (too be expected when cleaning chocolate) it was still easy to wash by hand. A bottle brush is indispensable when cleaning the tower. After hand washing I then put the tower pieces in the dishwasher to ensure sanitanizing. Keep the box it comes in for storing the Rival Chocolate fountain. I highly recommend the Rival Chocolate Fountain for anyone looking for a fountain product at a reasonable price."
2,Chocolate fountain flop,"The fountain works... once. the problem with this product is the auger is made of plastic, and after one use it wore down so much, now it doesnt spin. DON'T buy this product, it's poorly manufactured, and you will be dissapointed."
3,"Nice, but not great...","Doesn't flow chocolate like the picture, in facta lot slower. After melting the chocolate downand pouring it in the fountain, it only pumpsout streams down the sides, not the thick sheetsthat are displayed in pictures. Otherwise it is funand a great little toy to play with, not recommendedfor more that four people at a time."
4,Fun! And yum!!!,"The fountain was a blast, but I'll actually remember the party more for the taste of the chocolate we got to go in the fountain. It was the best chocolate I've ever tasted! We got it online from a company called Chocoley. The best thing was their chocolate is made for these fountains so you don't have to add any oil like you do to other chocolates. Yummmmmmm!"
2,slow flow!,"We could never get the true waterfall effect, we used 4.5 lbs of chocolate and gradually added more and more oil. We also made sure the unit was level, so I don't know why it didn't flow consistently--part of the unit flowed nicely, but about half of the circumference was ""dribbling.""Next time, I will forego the extra oil I used in trying to achieve the waterfall effect, as it began to affect the taste of the chocolate (premium style, for which I paid $14.99/lb.!)I probably wouldn't buy this again, but it's OK. I was disappointed at the rave reviews on this site vs. our experience. I would have preferred the Sephra fountain, even for the extra money--but I didn't have enough time before my event to have it shipped. The only thing they manufacture is chocolate fountains and provide you with chocolate that doesnt require adding oil or pre-melting, so I suspect it may be a better quality and easier to use."
4,Worked well for a fun kids' party,I bought this for the teen party after my son's bar mitzvah. The kids had a great time dipping all sorts of things into it and it worked well. Pretty easy to clean in the dishwasher. A good value for the price.
4,We love ours - but read my warning below!,"WARNING--this product is great and will work exactly like it says IF you use at least 4-5 pounds of chocolate and add all the oil it recommends (don't worry, the chocolate tastes fine with the oil mixed in). If you do not use this amout, it will not sheet/flow properly and will just trickle down. This minimum chocolate amount is not part of the instructions, but can be found on the box on a sticker that the factory must have added after the box was printed. Since a 60 oz (3.75 pound) bag of chips can be purchased at Costo/Sams Club for only about 6.99, even if you end up tossing a lot at the end, it's still a decent value especially for a large gathering."
3,Top tier arrived melted,"The product arrived defective and after melting the chocolate in a microwave, it didn't flow smoothly as it showed in pictures. Melting the chocolate in a double boiler gives you a better texture for the fountain to flow."
2,not worth the effort,A friend got this as a present and brought it to our party to used. It used lots of chocolate and tons of oil. It kept on siezing all night long so we had to keep adding more oil. The element did not keep the chocolate warm enough so that it would flow properly. We eventually gave up and we to a good old chocolate fondue pot.
1,"No longer manufactured, parts are nonreplacable/warranty not valid","This chocolate fountain worked ok and I was happy with it for the price but if you lose a part or a part gets damaged then you are out of luck. Rival no longer makes chocolate fountains of any kind and they do not have any replacement parts for them. So as long as you don't ever end up with a damaged part, the motor doesn't blow, or you don't lose any parts then you're ok. I asked the customer rep at Rival how they were going to honor their one year warranty if they don't make them anymore and apparently the warranty isn't valid anymore because of this. I'm going to purchase a better one in the store where I can return it if something happens.Just want you to be aware of this. Won't be purchasing Rival products again. Poor customer service."
3,Ok product,2 things I don't like about this product: The amount of oil you have to put in it and the mess it creates! Everyone loves it but the person who has to clean up the mess. It's a really nice idea but I personally don't like to use it because it's also hard to clean unless you stick it in the dishwasher right away because the chocolate gets hard when it's cooled.
4,Big and Rich,"Met all expectations. We bought two. Taller that I thought and worked well as long as you kept the chocolate thinned out a bit.Big hit with the crowd, clean-up messy, but not difficult."
1,Not a good investment,"Unfortunately,I bought this fountain for the 1st. birthday party of my granddaughter..and as you can imagine, we were very excited about it. We spent hours trying to make it work properly, we spent a lot of chocolate, lots of oil and never worked and it had a horrible noise. I called the company and explained in detail my case and the man on the phone said they will refund my money.... yes, I am still waiting. Not only I had bad luck getting a broken fountain but bad luck in getting my money back."
4,AKAI 42 INCH PLASMA MONITOR,Interesting post from another. Since buying mine over four years ago and moving 4 times I have not had any problems with it. Thing is it is a MONITOR NOT A TV.. I watch HD TV with no problems. The one problem I am having is finding another remote due to my girlfriends mutt chewing it up.I have also run it on generator power and again no problems.The contradiction on the other poster is this? If you lose pixels by moving it as claimed? Then how was it ever shipped in the cardboard box and get to the store and then to your house and still work? The power supply also has nothing due to it being moved..This monitor has done fine as a TV with the digital HD box and I also have a computer hooked to it as a multimedia PC - movies; games and more...
5,Cables,perfect for what I needed - easy to install- price was right - could not find in local stores- thanks for your help
1,Have to disagree,"This is NOT a book for non-physicists. I have a doctorate in Dentistry and began reading the book, thinking it would become less obtuse. Ten pages later, I resorted to flipping each page in the hope that I would find something that made sense to a ""layman""...no such luck. It could have been written in a medieval Persian language and I would have learned as much from it."
2,Dated Description of Cosmology,"This book was first published in 1977, and the discoveries in the 29 years since then have made the material obscelecent."
3,Excellent photos but poor reading,"Like always, the Muench's photos are excellent but from the viewpoint of a book; especially, a how-to book, this book has not met its mark.Lots of rumblings but does not delve into techniques and how-to's.Conclusions: good coffee table book but it will not be in landscape photography reference shelves."
3,Love the movie but cannot put on English soundtrack.,First of all I love Gamera. I even have a pet tortoise named Gamera but we tried to watch the Blu ray tonight and can't get the english soundtrack to work. We tried a few different ways and it always went back to Japanese. I hope that they will fix this!!
5,the final conflict,This movie was the last Gamera movie to be made that I know off.When a young girl who's parents were killed during the first Gayos invasion in a flashg back see swear revenge gamera. The ayos are heading to tokeyo by the millions. Enter in a new monster irish who bounds with this anger stircken child. Can Gamere save the cild and all of tokeyo once again from utter desturction find out in the thrilling conclusion. There are about twent of thedse movies but only six have been converted to DVD. I have the original gamera together on one disk along with attack of thegiant leaches and attack of the blood beast. To get the other films you might have to get them on DVD. There is also suppodedly was a movie made when Gamera fights godzilla but have yet toi find it unless it's that stupid slammy brothers movie. If I here about any new Gamera movies in developement or for release I will inform you.
3,Gamera 3 revenge of Iris,"Do not know why the R rating, the effects where not that good, story could have been better the older gameras had a better story line this was not bad but if this is a reboot please try again"
3,Rollercoaster!,"I enjoy monster movies, especially Godzilla and Gamera. I thought that this third installment of Gamera is a huge improvement. The special effects during the fight scenes, and their view from a person's prospective, are excellent for a japanese monster movie and better than Godzilla 2000, however still not quite up to the American standards. My major complaint is regarding the acting and overall plot which it just does not seem to change much from movie to movie and they are mediocre at best. Also the dubbing to english is not that great either. The dvd picture quality is very good and the sound is good as well. Overall: FAIR."
3,"GREAT FX, MEDIOCRE STORY","While this is clearly the most visually stunning of the three Gamera films--the sequence where Gamera fights Gyaos in downtown Tokyo will set the benchmark of Kaiju battles--the story relies so much on the metaphysical that it's hard to understand. Add two characters who do nothing but extrapolate this confusing plot just before they die senselessly, and you find yourself scratching your head and wondering how this could come from the same writer/director as the first two Gamera films. Still the monsters are great, and turning Gamera into an anti-hero--as hinted at with the closing line of Gamera 2--was inspired. The special effects will knock you out of your seat, and for that alone the movie is worth the purchase price."
3,Gamera 3 blue ray disc,"Bought this for my husband as a christmas gift, he seems to be happy with it even though i never watched it so i cant give a movie review"
1,"Murder, Gore or Handycam and ketchup","God aweful Movie!!!!!!!!!! Don't watch, Stay far far far away from it. Not even so ad its funny. Its so bad its painful"
5,tool of the year for me,"I do tile for a living and install cement wet beds on metal lathe. I used a bump head craftsman 1/2"" air gun for the last 15 years. I went to buy another case of staples online for that gun and they are no longer available. I got the duofast gun because it seemed like I would be able to get staples in the future. I was nervous about the fully auto feature. It payed for itself the first time I used it. I put in about 15,000 staples in 800 square feet of floor without one misfire or jam. It cut the time to do the job of stapling the wire lathe to the floor in half. Everyone on the job, including myself, were impressed at how fast and good it put in the staples. Awesome stapler."
5,Hidden Gems!,"These rarely mentioned or recorded partitas lie hidden in the work of Weiss. They stand above any of the Dresden manuscript's contents for sheer emotive power in this performance. This is the stuff that makes Weiss one of the top Baroque lute composers.I had picked these CDs up to get a better ""flavor"" of Sylvius Leopold's complete works and was very pleasantly surprised. I would normally not give a 5 star rating to an album unless I deemed it exceptional. I think this one truly is!"
5,Very Nice,I have never had a straight bit (or any other) with a top bearing before. I learned something on You-Tube that required a straight bit with a top bearing so I bought one. It works great so far. I heard that Freud has good bits and stand behind their tools so with a desent price and shipping cost with Amazon I am happy.
5,Super Gals rocks next to Sailor Moon!,"Super Gals is so cool. Its about 3teenagers who are ready to shop till they drop. You get 5episodes on This DVD. The Worlds Greatest Gal. Phone Tag Gets Chilling, A girls feelings, Luck with guys, Fresh start Broken heart. Ran Kotobuki is the worlds greatest gal. Very good epiosdes i reccomend buying thid DVD."
4,Needed a helmet....,So we got a helmet for my son's Knight costume! It was a bit small but the only thing that looked right! The snaps are hard to use but it was only for a Halloween!
1,Cheesy looking,"I ordered for Halloween costume. My son did not wear it, I knew I was returning it once I opened the box. It looks like it's made out of tin foil, the material is a good idea gone wrong. It is soft and seemed like it would be good for small children but it just looks cheap and silly. Save your time and money and do not buy this item."
5,WE LOVE THIS!,"Ordered this for my 3 year old who wants to be Super Grover for Halloween. Couldn't find a child size Super Grover, so we are using this along with a blue sweatsuit and an awesome cape I ordered here on Amazon. My son loves to wear this soft & comfortable helmet...perfect for youngsters and comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time. It will be great for dress up and maybe even a trip to the Renessance Festival too! Great find at a great price."
2,Mundane and Uneventful,"I bought this book thinking that it might be interesting and even funny, but I was disappointed after reading the first few stories. The humor is predictable and Michelle's writing is flat and leaves no room for the imagination. I felt like I was reading someone's diary who is very bored with their life. I had to put the book down. I hope that the author comes up with more interesting material before she decided to put pen to paper again."
1,Much better Chicana fiction out there...,"I was disappointed after reading this book. I love reading the work of new Chicana writers. However, this book gives ""Chicana"" fiction a bad name - I mean, would have this been published had ""Chicana"" not been in the title? Sure, the title may help it sell, but its what is inside a book that matters, which in this case is nothing more than fluff and boring material. I'm a big fan of Chicana fiction - Julia Alvarez and Ana Castillo are some of my favorite authors - but this simply does not qualify as any type of fiction, period."
3,Chicana Power,"A book for all Chicanas, this book is filled with humorous tidbits and ideas on how to be a ""Chicana Role Model."""
4,"Funny, Lively, light reading","Not usually a fiction/memoir reader I usually go for literary biographies or business/nonfiction politics, history etc. But after listening to my wife laugh for a few days reading this I decided to give this a try over the weekend...boy am I glad I did.Smart, witty and at times quite touching. I especially loved the story of about here winning the scholarship/grant and the reaction of her father to this news...(no , I wont give it awat, you have to read it and find out). Although , set in a Latino neighborhood in LA, the themes and problems she tackles are universal and ones we can all relate to....Michele Soros in a gem!"
4,Give this chica a break!,"The beauty of culture is each person's own self expression. This book was a light-hearted and fun read, nothing more, nothing less. Instead of putting it under the microscopic spotlight, I think this this book should be celebrated. It's refreshing to see yet another angle of chicana life. There are no rules in this game of who we are and where we came from. I personally will continue to support chicana/latina/hispana writers from all walks of life!"
2,...but not a writing role model,"I raced to buy this book after hearing Michele Serros interviewed on National Public Radio. She came across as so articulate, energetic and intelligent that I was really looking forward to reading her work. After struggling through about the first quarter of the book, I have had to admit defeat and replace it on my shelf, largely unread. The writing is painfully banal, and downright boring at times. The issues raised seem very familiar to anyone who's thought about race, culture and gender, but no new insights come from their telling. Much is explicitly spelled out for the reader, where better writers would have built enough richness into the characters and the dialog to carry the point without further explanation. Serros clearly had a lot to say when interviewed in person, but her writing isn't mature enough yet to be in print."
1,How (Not) To Be A Chicana Writer,"The writing is just plain sloppy. Each story is a farce - undeveloped, silly and far-fetched. I seriously doubt that this book would have been published if it were not written by a Latina, during a time when Chicana fiction is finally (and justifiably) exploding. Unfortunately, when you move past the ""Chicana"" theme here, which seems exploited in this case, there is nothing of substance left to this book. What you are left with is some very poor writing."
1,The Taco Bell of Latina Literature,"Serros makes a few mildly entertaining observations, but she in no way matures as a person through her writing. That is something that every good memoir must entail. The writing is childlike. The observations have been made before, usually by better writers.A good chunk of the book is used for Serros to assert her superiority over whites. She makes sweeping generalizations about non-Latinos. If a white writer did that they would be run out of town on a rail (rightfully so).I'm your average white, middle class American. But I have several years of studying Spanish and Latino literature under my belt, both for fun and school. I've read stories that were much more compelling than this one.Try Julia Alvarez, or Sandra Cisneros if you're looking for intelligent Latinas. Try Serros if you're looking for shallow mediocrity..."
2,Best for a young audience,"A lot of excellent chicana/o literature has been surfacing as of late, and I was very excited to get my hands on this selection of short stories. Some of Michele's stories are funny, even silly at times, and other stories plainly reveal the day-to-day prejudice one has to endure becuase of the color of one's skin. However, Michele's writing is a bit juvenile and simplistic. I would recommend this book to a younger audience as some adults may find it a bit tedious and boring."
5,Very very touching!,"This DVD was a very very touching story. You can feel the sadness and the love between the characters, and the music sets the mood perfectly. It's an amazing anime, and one of my favorites."
3,"Good or bad, depends on what you're lookin for.","This movie is a love story, and not even a sappy one. The action in minimal, but is existan,t and there are enough plot holes that you don't know what happened to cause this war, how the war is solved, or even how the movie is resolved. but that's not tht point.I do not believe those were the intensions of the film. I think he wanted to show you love. Love that superceeds distance and time, though both are great factors in this equation.The movie itself, bonus features aside, is only about a half hour. I would give this as a suggestion to an anime buff dude who would like a female friend to get into it as much as he does. The animation is clear, the story simple...it is, in a sense, a very ""pretty"" movie.As far as breakin girls into anime,Princess Mononokeis great for that as well."
2,"Short, interesting, mixed in quality","This is a 30-minute work made by a single artist. The story is somewhat reminiscent of Haldeman's classic SF novel ""The Forever War."" The artwork is variable... the characters themselves tend to be poorly rendered and at times almost grotesque. On the other hand the imagery of the fighting mechs are very well done and fascinating. The story itself is reasonably satisfying although very angst-filled.The DVD also includes some very interesting extra material including an interview with the artist and one of his earlier works which is quite good. Overall you wont get much for your money. But if you are an artist interested in seeing what can be done by a single person with passion and drive this is as good an example as there is."
2,A little to distant for me even as an avid anime fan.,"I thought the premise of this sounded good. It turned out to be one of those things we regular folk just don't get. Now I love anime in most of its forms, except gratuituous mecha. I had hopes for this one as a good, sci-fi topic. It might have made an impression, had it been a bit longer. As it was, its hardly worth the money for a 25 minute runtime, when I was expecting a bit more of a movie.I've seen some excellent award winning, short animations, where the animation itself told a great story. I will admit there are a few parts like that in this film. Unfortunately, there are also time wasting, still shot moments, which should only be part of a longer piece. In the end, I was left with a lot of questions, and maybe that was the point of it all. I still hate it when the existential artists make something, and their patrons tell us we should all like it. If you like thought pieces OK, but I'd still advise renting this one first."
1,No Romeo and Juliet,"While I can understand the appeal of a good doomed love story, this one didn't cut it for me. I picked it up on a whim, without having read any gushing-oh-look-what-this-brilliant-guy-did-all-alone type reviews before I saw it. I hated it! With the sparse dialogue, the lack of action, the pointlessness of the story, the absence of a conclusion...it was painful to watch. It's easy to relate to the concept of pining for your would-be lover while he/she is away performing important duties, but, realistically, watching something that is drenched in those unhappy feelings with no sense of relief in sight is no way to spend your time."
1,nice but too short,"this is one very well animated movie.The problem is,its only 30 min which makes it more like an episode."
4,!,"Quite a good DVD. I had to watch it a couple of times to fully appreciate it. It has a great story with good animation.It brings to mind the questions of love and time travel. As Mikako travels to speeds close to the speed of light, she ages far less slower than her boyfriend Noboru as he is home on earth. Their love not only has to endure the effects of time travel but also the distances between them. The further she goes into space, the longer it takes for messages to be sent between them.The animation was good too. The only flaw would be the frame rate, as some parts were quite choppy, but it doesnt dampen the experience.Voices of a distant star is a touching story. Recommended."
2,Warning! This DVD is flawed!,"The feature is great! No question!But currently I can't recommend this DVD for purchase.As I discovered in a newsgroup there are several problem with this release.The most important one:The soundtrack featuring the director and his wife is MISSING!It was checked by several people. There are two sound version on this disc, but there are actually the same!So if you plan to purchase this disc, please remember that you probably won't get what you expected.I hope there will be a replacement coming very soon."
3,Shinkai's first but not his best,I thought this movie was alright. It was a bit sad and it was interesting and well done but I didn't like it all that much. I saw 5 centimeters per second before seeing this movie and I liked 5 centimeters per second much much better. Not bad to check out but I think you can expect better from Shinkai's later releases.
1,A Good Idea poorly executed,While the Animation is visually rich and the basic concept of lovers separated by the realities of Spaceflight are a good start they have not been used effectively. What there is of a plot is told rather than shown. Despite the characters occasional claims to the contrary there is no real character development. In all this made for a rather dull 30 minuets of viewing.
1,Not Worth any reward ... how did this got a reward,"when i look for anime or animation then i'm looking for "" ANIMATION "" this one don't have any .. i think its animated by Flash or some other program .. i feel cheated by the "" three award winner stuff "" , i'm a huge fan of great "" ANIMATIONS "" , i like to see the drawings move . i saw better 3D graphics on PS1 , don't get fooled by the cover it makes you feel that you found a treasure .. but its fools-gold .it is really bad ... the only good thing here is the coloring and the background art but the same is used too often , i don't write reviews that much but i hated this anime that i even didn't care to complete half of it and went to my laptop to write this review , a really really honest advice DON'T BUY IT , DON'T RENT IT and DON'T STEEL IT , its not worth it . YUK how did i buy it .."
4,"Good game,needs joystick, not for Win 7","This game is pretty good, but very complicated to learn all the key commands that are required to play without a joystick. It's not entirely clear which joysticks or yokes work with it, either. IT DOES NOT INSTALL ON WINDOWS 7 !!!"
5,Discgear Selector Makes DVD Selection/Storage Simple,"We love the Discgear Selector because it saves storage space and makes locating the DVD we want to view quick and easy. We can also tell from a quick review of the listing which DVD's we have, without having to sort through all the little plastic boxes the DVD's came in."
5,my favorite cartoon,This cartoon is broadcasted as TV series during early eighties (1985-1988). I am happy to find its VHS. Don't hesitate to watch it. But now as a child development specialist I don't recommend children who are younger than 6 years.
4,Very good but sometimes messes up,I bought this memory card and started putting all my saves on this. It worked fine until I put an NFL2K save on page 7. It seems whenever I put a large file on page 7 in corrupts it. But sides my page 7 problem it works perfecly and I highly recomend it. It also hooks up to a PC and you can download saves and stuff.
2,works . . . When IT feels like it!,"I really thougt this was going to be a good product.but i've had this card for a while, and i think it needs some jackhammering.I see why people like the vmu's;they work!This memory card might work for a month, and then stop working for two months, . . . My advice is to buy the vmu."
3,A good book on cleaning.,"A fair and good book on the subject. I have a friend who has all these books for her business, and I when through them all. This is not bad, and will get you going if you like.I mean, cleaning is a sort of basic business, its not that its hard, its that no one wants to do it - that is the success principle of the cleaning business.I can really recommend the following book on the subject, its VERY good and anyone fighting the recession will win big if they follow this one book:Mopping Up Millions!: Making A Killing In Cleaning -Get busy and make some money!"
1,Only gave this one star because no other option,"This has to be the worse ""anime"" I have ever seen in 17 years of watching anime. Not only didn't the story make any sense the animation has to be some of the worse I have ever seen. Not just bad animation, but poorly lit, I swear a few of the pieces were cut outs. I generally will do everything I can to watch an anime, and rarely turn it off midway, but this garbage I did. Avoid this title at all cost!!!"
1,"A theme, not a story","Watching this disc is like starting a book about 300 pages in and trying to figure out what's going on, but then deciding to stop reading with another 200 pages to go. There is no beginning or ending to this incoherent mess, just some stuff that happens for no explainable reason."
4,Good product for the $$,"This digital picture frame was a great value. The frame itself has a quality look to it and the operation aspect of it is easy to use. Picture quality is good as well. The only reason I give it 4 stars is the speaker quality...not great but adequate, which is not really an issue for me since I wanted the frame primarily for displaying pictures at a wedding. Overall, a great value for a quality product."
5,"10"" Picture Frame","The product was excellent and in amazing condition. On the other hand, the time between ordering and recieving the package was extremely extended. We did not recieve the item till after a month after we ordered it. I expect much better out of companies working out of amazon."
3,This product works if you don't have too many photos to run a slideshow.,"I'm having trouble to display all photos in my 256MB SD. While play music and run a slideshow simultaneously, it only display about 300+ photos then jump back to the first photo and display again even though I have total about 1400+ pictures in the SD card. The tech support can not help me to resolve this problem. I did a replacement to change a different frame but same problem happen. So I have to return it. Too bad. The frame looks really nice and elegant but it can't function what I ask for.*** But I have to give Amazon customer service an excellent rating. They really make my whole purchasing process much easier and fun. Thank you."
5,Really good frame,"My brother bought this frame for his wife about 2 months ago. He liked it so much he suggested we get one for our parents anniversary. So he had it shipped to my home because I'm the family historian and have most of the pictures my folks would want. I selected 2900+ pictures and converted them to 640x480. All 2900+ pics plus 15 Glenn Miller songs fit on a 512MB SD card with about 50MB still vacant. I liked the frame so much I just bought one for my wifes birthday. Really good looking; both the actual frame and the images. I'm a fairly serious digital photgrapher and I didn't think 640x480 resolution could look this good. Looks much better than I expected. Sounds just OK, but about what you'd expect with the size speakers that can fit in something this size."
2,"Looks great, but quirky","Rec'd this 5/31, and for 3-4 days it worked OK. Then the problems started. Customer support tried to help, but when I solved one problem another popped up. I finally quit a couple days ago when the slideshow quit in the middle, music would start up somehow, and screen continally froze and went back to opening screen. Had to manually turn off and on to get file and menu. Sent it back yesterday. But SIX stars to Amazon for their cooperation. That's why if Amazon has what I want, they always get the order."
3,Kinda happy,"I got this to give to my wife for mothers day 2007.We where expecting our next child at the end of the month so thought it would be great and Amazon had a Gold Box sale with $40 off price.It works fine for first month but I think I see it getting a touch dimmer. Not sure if its just my eyes or not. My wife still loves it and see's no issues, but she maybe just biased cause of the photos on it.She does love it, she turns it on everyday and when feeding the newborn just stares at it.The 10.4"" seems big at the time, but truth is I wouldn't get anything smaller that that in future. I may upgrade to a Philips model in a years time, I hear they are very bright.BTW, it only takes 640x480 images, if you have a larger image it scales on fly down. No biggie. I just export my images reduced size from iPhoto to the SD card.Ed W."
1,Not a good buy,"Impressive looking, large frame. It would not read my SD memory cards reliably. After much fussing and reinserting the SD card it might work, but usually didn't. I complained and was shipped another frame which had the same results. I ended up requesting a refund. I was very disappointed."
4,Great product,"It is a great product, very easy to operate, great size, accepts all my flash card formats. But the resolution could be better and the plastic in the back (ok, no one will look at the back of a picture frame) looks cheap.Compared with other products I know, I still think it's a great one."
1,Not compatible,I got this product and could not get it to work with my Mac as advertised. There is no phone number to contact these people for product support. Don't want anything they don't give you a phone number to contact for product support.
1,It never worked,"It never worked for me, I sent couple of emails to the vendor and never got a response.Hate to say that but never had this kind of experience as I could'nt find any customer service number to contact."
3,Works well in spite of insides being loose,Portable USA 10.4-Inch Digital Picture Frame (PU10W)I chose this digital picture frame because of its larger size. When it arrived the digital card slot on the side was loose inside the frame. I was able to turn the frame on the side and gently shake it into place where I could insert an SD card. The SD card holds it in place while in use but I will have to be careful when I change the card to show additional pictures. I chose to put up with the problem rather than pack and ship the frame back. The pictures are reasonably clear and bright and people who have seen the pictures have enjoyed them.
3,looks ok- works well,Seems fine. I like the looks of some others a little better. User friendly so far.
2,Disappointing,"First one received had glass broken, so got another quickly and with no problem and no extra expense.Menus are very difficult to understand, manual is inccorrect on some menu options.The only way to just display a single picture is to pause a slideshow on that picture and then a pause icon appears in the upper right of your picture and just stays there. The only other way is to delete everything on the frame memory and only insert one picture and then hit slide show.The button to progress through a slide show doesn't work all that well, but seems to function if you keep hitting it. Why do engineers think it is cute that a single button has multiple uses depending upon what part of a menu you are in?The email help from company was very responsive when I had menu problems (how can they make money if they have to answer questions from everyone who buys one???)AJ"
4,"Love it, best for its price!","This unit arrived very well packed. Instructions reasonably well written, that means that it made sense and I could follow the instructions. I loaded up several pictures and mp3 music. Amazing, it worked as advertised.Would recommend this product, especially when compared to the prices of others on the market."
5,Great,"I first saw this movie on TV under the title ""A Thousand Men and A Baby. I thought it was one of the best movies I ever saw."
5,Try keeping your feet still will this plays at full volume!,"With a familiarity that reaches back to the old country and lyrics that will etch themselves as part of the 20th century American experience, this CD is magic. No serious bluegrass collection should be without this work. Get one for you and one for your children!"
4,Very satisfactory read!,"Well written and credible detail. The intricacy of the relations, especially racial and legal were right on target. Exciting finish--even if you guess the final bad guy. I am looking forward to the further adventures of Tom, Joey and Kelly and I highly recommend this to my fellow crime readers."
5,Hard to put down and full of twists and turns.,"It is hard to believe that SINS OF THE BROTHER is Mike Stewart's first novel. This book just gets better and better and ends too soon! The plot twists and turns and the action speeds up as it rushes toward several surprises at the end. Stewart's Tom McInnes is believable as a clever, wisecracking attorney caught up in a whirlwind of a mystery. I can't wait to read the next book by this accomplished fellow Alabamian!"
3,A solid effort,"I wrote because the other reviews are so gushing in their praise of this book. It is quite good, but it can be a little bit predictable at times. There are too many fist-fights, which the hero always wins. Also, the ending is an improbable ""deal"" between the hero and the villian. The hero also seems to find everything he is seeking without having to work too hard.In its favor the author does a good job describing his characters, including their flaws."
5,Excellent Southern Action,"I really enjoyed this book and hope to see more good things from Mike Stewart. He fills the book with a strong leading man, evil henchmen, beautiful and suspicous women, and tightly plotted action scenes. The final wrap-up is one that is logical and suspenseful if not a little familiar. I definitely recommend this novel and only wished more thrillers of this caliber were released more frequently."
5,Too Good for a 1st Novel,"Mr. Stewart (no relation) has written as good a crime novel as I have ever read. I do not see any of the rough spots so often obvious in first novels.The suspense never stops, but he also gets into the details somewhat like James Lee Burck. This guy is destined for greatness. We will hear a lot more about him."
4,Let the water wash you clean,"This author-attorney has created a not-so-nice, intelligent protaganist, who relies on brains more than brawn to solve the mystery of his not-so-nice brother's death. After a slow start the pace gets rolling and the last third of the book holds you to the end. Lots of action and realistic fight scenes mixed with a plausible puzzle reward the reader."
2,"Adequate, but didn't live up to the other reviews","This book was an adequate read, but not in the same class as Robert Parker or Michael Connelly. It seemed surprisingly brief for a novel, but perhaps brevity is a virtue when one has not so much to say. While I suppose no one is fond of lawyers, and it IS a work of fiction, I did not find the attorneys in the book to be very believeable. However, in one area, the author truly excels. His ear for the behavior of your stereotypical white trash rednecks is tuned quite finely. Write what you know best, I say. This book was mildly entertaining, but Scott Turow and John Grisham should continue to sleep easily."
1,Page turner... true. But more like a Jerry Springer Show.,"This book was somewhat entertaining on the beach, but in all reality was just eye candy and offered no nutritional value. The characters portray all Southerners as gun-toting, fist-fighting idiots who eat Crawfish ettouffee for breakfast, lunch and dinner.How many times can an author write a scene about the main character beating someone senseless and continue to make it interesting? This book will surely push that boundary.Loose plot ends are tied up in a paragraph or two in the last pages of the book, leaving the other 300 or so pages to describe in great detail just how tall, attractive and physically brutish the main character is (modeled after the author's self-perception?? perhaps)This book might as well be called ""Sins of the Author""."
1,Bate and Switch!! They still owe me money for returned item!,"I bought this thinking it was Vangaurd, and trust me, its not! It's cheap, looks cheap, and couldn't trust to put anything in there. So I left a bad review, and their customer service called me right away. They told me they want to work with me, so I was actually happy about it at first. So thought it would be easier just to replace it with another product, Sakar video light, well guess what, another bait and switch. They sent me the lesser costing, cheapest video light I've ever seen, and it wasn't what I ordered, again! They still owe me money!!"
4,"Nice sturdy camera case, at a good price","This is a nice sturdy case with good flexibility in custom fitting your equipment. Its a big improvement from the soft bag I was using. I have a D200, 3 lenses and a SB 800flash along with batteries and misc items. No more room but it holds that good."
4,A wonderful simulation game,It took me sometime to start with the game especially to understand how to fly a wonderful machine like the F22. Once you are used to it things turn out awesome and great. There are a number of missions that you can choose from. Most missions are really good. Some are very difficult. However all missions are guaranteed to give you fun. One feature that amazed me is a war like simulation where you got to plan according to the situation and execute it.
4,Awesome,"This is 23 church hymnals done by Elvis. For years I've been searching for a version of Hark the Herald Angels sing that I was satisfied with. i find it here in Elvis of all places, an excellent rendition. Other prime cuts are: Deck the Halls, Silent Night, Joy to the World, O Little Town of Bethleham, Away in a Manger, o Come All Ye Faithful and We Wish You a Merry Christmas."
5,This is an Awesome set.,"This knight set is AWESOME. It takes forever to build though. But, I like to build it. It's the funnest part. It's a little overpriced. This set is very big and can fold to do all kinds of stuff. It comes with 7 guys and 4 catupults and ballista's that shoot stuff. It has a working drawbridge and 3 different types of building with traps and Lord Vladek's Shadow Knights. This set is highly reccommended. If you really like it, You should get the Citadel Of Orlan and the expansions."
4,Definitely worth the price of admission. . .,"I've had the pleasure of working with both of these fine musicians for several years (I've known David since I was a freshman in college and he was just starting graduate school). David and Brian have put together a very fine project in dB Smoothe. It currently stays in the car with me at all times and is a good way for me to unwind after a long day of playing my horn. FOR YOU CASUAL BANDLEADERS OUT THERE, TAKE NOTE: this is a great CD for you to spin at gigs during dinner or when the band is on a break."
3,Good way to learn one tenth of Metallica song,"I bought this DVD thinking that the instructor teaches the entire song. Wrong! While the instructor breaks down solos and riffs which makes it incredibly easy for people to play, only fractions of the song is explained.I guess it's cool to be able to play signature riffs and solos, but I'd like to learn how to play the entire song. Only being able to play like a minute out of 6 minute Metallica song isn't worth buying a $20 DVD.And the fact that the instructor does a wonderful job of explaining makes it worse. With his instructions, I could be playing any Metallica songs in no time (both James' and Kirk's parts) But, that's not the case here. It would've been the perfect way to learn hard Metallica songs.. but they stopped way way short of accomplishing that goal."
1,Waste of money,"I expected to have the entirety of each song dissected on these DVDs. Not so. You only get the easy parts that you can figure out for yourself. For example, on ""Sad But True"" you only get the first few opening bars. Holy moley I had that already, and I bet that everybody else does as well.Don't waste your money. If you have problems look up the tab on the net and just bang on the CD until you have it."
3,a bit disapointing,"The video is fine, but there are only partial riffs , no full songs. Good if that is all you want. I don't use it much."
3,Dumps upside down,"Butter in small cup preserved with water in base. Only butter often dumps out of the ""lid"" cup. That with having to add the butter to the lid makes it more trouble than it's worth."
3,Flawed design,"I loved the concept of a fully automatic toaster, and when this toaster is working properly, it toasts beautifully and quickly. Within 2 weeks of purchase it started acting erratically. It would fail to stop toasting and would not lift the bread. The cancel button would not stop the toasting process and without a lift lever, the only option was to unplug the unit, wait for it to cool down, turn it upside down and try to shake the burnt toast out over the sink. It didn't misbehave regularly, but often enough that I did not feel safe leaving this unit unattended while in use."
1,"If zero stars were an option, russel hobbs would've gotten it!","I really do not know if at one time Russell Hobbs was a good name brand. It certainly is not one now. They are owned by SALTON who makes appliances for almost every ""Walmart"" ""China"" made garbage manufacturer out there today.Don't let them fool you into the WAY TOO HIGH price for this piece of junk.Made in China, and not worth the gasoline it would take to start it on fire.What complete JUNK!!!! It stopped working properly within days!!!!Sorry, but gone are the days of the good old made in America Toastmaster toasters our grandparents had! (incidentally, SALTON now owns Toastmaster too!!!)They have the same garbage Chinese manufacturer making all of these toasters and appliances, and putting all different brand names on them.They should all have only one brand name: ""El Crappo"""
4,Refreshing... Curtis at his bests.,Curtis is always so inspiring..Always refreshing to the ear.His band and musicians are so tightthey make you move everytime.
1,Dismal... absolutely dismal.,"This is actually an unlicensed bootleg, and the production quality is absolutely horrid. It's just a bunch of old interviews recorded from television."
5,It's one of the best books written on the subject,"I picked up Susan Braudy's book first among the pile a friend of mine recommend because the title 'Between Marriage and Divorce' describes exactly where I was at the moment. I was immediately drawn in within the first few pages reading the details of her question, fear, confusion. It is so real, I was so touched to read how her desire to be herself worked against her intention to protect her 'perfect' marriage and how she needed support from her husband but could not get it. Many of my friends and I are going through the same thing, this books helps me understand better some of the emotions and struggles women go through especially when the husband and the marriage seem so 'perfect' to all th outsiders.The book is beautifully written with a lot of insights. You can read it as a novel."
2,Suffers from a hyper-contentious attitude,"I find that Eric Svendsen's writings are having an effect on me that I presume can only be counter to that which Dr. Svendsen intends. Elsewhere I've read his ill-conceived critiques of John Paul II's theology of the body. Dr. Svendsen, while apparently capable of parsing biblical Greek, cannot repair to an English dictionary to learn the difference between ordinate sexual attraction and sexual lust - an inordinate sexual desire - and in his misunderstanding complains that the avowedly celibate pontiff is criticizing healthy marital relations. Where John Paul II posits a theology of the body, Dr. Svengali provides a horse's arse theology.Don't expect much better from this book."
3,As Advertised,"Ordered Friday night, received Tuesday AM...I was impressed.Thanks to Affordable Med and FedEx for the quick delivery.Table was easy to assemble and functions as advertised.Like some others, I didn't like all the little foam pieces they packed around the table. They were a pain to wipe off and they get everywhere.I might end up attaching some kind of decorative angle iron to the front edge, so stuff won't slide off too easy when the table is tilted.Still, we like the table. It adjusts easy, rolls easy, looks OK and from what I've seen it is priced right.Cheers,Rich"
4,"Great for laptop, reading or small projects","Definately worth the purchase price. The table has proven useful for a variety of purposes, laptop table, reading/taking notes, working on small craft projects and eating. It was easy to assemble with just a few parts. I take 1 star off perfect score for the height adjustment, the spring ""assist"" seems to keep it from locking into some intermediate heights. While it won't work to slide under a chair, I've had no problem in any of my chairs, sofa, etc getting it to set at a useful height to set it in front of the chair. It is much more comfortable than a regular tv tray or sofa table. In the short time I've had it, the table has already made it through most of the rooms in the house house and forayed out into the garage."
2,Not Great,Functional but not great. Messy packaging. Rough finishing. Price OK. Quality not impressive.
4,Deluxe Tilt Overbed Table,"When the box came, it has been repackaged into a much larger box because the original box had been opened. Table went together very easily, but one of the wheel locks had been broken. Since this did not impact overall functionality of the table, we did not bother to return. Would suggest checking as soon as you receive to make sure there is no damage and all parts are there. Overall table does what we wanted and serves the purpose well."
4,Graham Field over bed table,"Love my table. One small complaint...you really have to turn the knobreally hard to keep it from tilting.Saw some previous complaints about that it's hard to bring down when up high.There's a trick. When something heavvy is sitting on it the table looses its 90 degree, I would say it's a safety feature so it won'tslam down on your legs. Never pull down table on the other side of the lever.While you pull the lever to lower push down and with your other hand slightly push table up to get it level. It took a little practice,but it's working."
3,Serves its purpose,"It is strong, BUT has a side to side wobble. Its greatest weakness are its casters. They're plastic and will break surprisingly easy. DO NOT subject the casters to hard impact and DO NOT put stress on the rolling casters."
3,Table,I purchased an over-the-bed (hospital-type) table. I am not completely satisfied with my purchase. When I have used this type table before (always in a hospital) there has never been a problem with the table staying at the right height. My husband and I have tried to get this table to stay at a certain height but it just keeps going up about 2 or 3 inches from where we set it and I have to keep pushing it back down when I am using it.
1,Terrible Product,"I purchased this product for pc laptop tables for Christmas 2007, it's now January 14, 2008 and one is completely broken and the other doesn't function properly. They are made so cheaply that they are destined not to last. The biggest piece of junk I have ever purchased. DO NOT BUY!!!!!"
3,good,The table works fairly well. Rolling freely is hard since we have it on carpet. Only problems are the top tends to tilt slightly a all times not when a tilt is wanted and when pushing the table top completely down it pushes itself up several inches.
4,Home Hospital Style Overbed Over Bed Tilt Top Table/Computer Tray,"This tray is great for using in bed. The tray has plenty of room to set plates, glasses etc on it. It does have a small lip around it so things can't slide off. I didn't use the tilt but if you want to read or something it would be helpful or use the laptop in bed. I have one complaint that it should go lower because patients sometimes sit in a chair and then it is WAY TO HIGH. I wish I knew how to make it go lower. So that makes it to high when you are well enough to be out of bed sitting on the couch where you could use it too since a TV tray doesn't work well in that instance. If you know how to make it go shorter please let me know."
3,GOOD TRAY TABLE,The tray table works well as an over the bed work space..Its a good item for the price!
4,Tough and affordable,"Perfect for my pregnant wife. Wish there was another option besides faux wood grain, but other than that we love it!"
5,"This is very interesting, but very funny","Super gals is definetly a girl directed anime with a good message, but quite a bit of swearing. But for all those that can handle that, it's pretty cool. Ran and the others are very cute and very funny and enjoyable to watch. If you can't stand prep-type voices, this might not be the anime for you, but if you can get past that, it's a good show. I recommend this for all gals out there! So, 5 stars is good for this. I'm getting number 2! Ja ne! ^_^"
3,Wow * I'm * So * Bored.....!!!!!!,"Are you interested in fashion? Cute boys? Cliques? Lots of bright colors? If you do you will absolutely love this anime! If not, I suggest you move on and try something else. This is the kind of show I would have enjoyed when I was twelve years old. I'm no longer naive enough to believe a kick here, and a speech there, will suddenly change people. The main character Ran is a loud, obnoxious, cute, super strong girl who lives life all in a flurry. Her main concern is to have fun, fun, fun and more fun. She's the only character I really liked, all the other characters are quite boring and don't do much than stand around in the background unless a particular episode happens to revolve around them. Too bad for Ran-chan...if only this character had been in a different show...The best thing about this show is the ending theme song, ""Dakishimetai"". It's slow, touching, and very sad. The animation itself is decent and colors very bright."
5,Sawzall,This is just as powerful as the corded model. These 28 volt tools are smooth and quiet. Don't hesitate to buy one of these tools.
2,There are better books on the subject available,"My advice is to get ""Ancient Cahokia and the Mississippians"" by Pauketat, which is a much better book, with many more illustrations, and concerns itself with the archaeology and culture of Cahokia. This book ""Cahokia the Great Native American Metropolis"" is great if you want to learn much more about the interactions between the archeologists themselves, and not much about the culture of the Cahokia people and the archaeological site. I much prefer to spend my valuable time reading about the culture and the site, rather than the petty squabbles between the archaeolgists. Buy the book by Pauketat, not this book."
2,Terrible interface,"The reason this game is hard is because they completely botched the interface. Once the game gets going, its almost impossible to tell where things are going to land with any precision, and I found pieces constantly dropping where I didn't want them. Part of the reason also, is because the pieces take a minute to float over to where you want to drop them, which is completely ridiculous. (definitely not part of the N64 game) You'll think its lined up, only to have it drop a couple spaces off. I've been able to get my score up to 130,000 on the console version but can't even make it past 5,000 in this game. Terrible adaptation from the console game.The N64 version is by far my favorite game for the console though, and it is pretty addictive, which makes the PC version all the more frustrating."
5,Simple and Effective,"after determining what my Dell would take (using Crucial Scan), I ordered.delivery was prompt and the product was as described. installed easily andfunctions properly. this was a simple memory upgrade."
5,So far works great,"I ordered this for the dell dimension 2400 that I bought for my birthday. It was running 1 GB but I upgraded it to 1.5 GB. It can run programs like blender 3D and such. Just saying that when your installing it YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE STICK IN SO THAT THE CLIPS FIT INTO THE TOP CREVICES. Thanks to my dad who saw that. Anyway, it's a whole lot faster and for all of those who keep wondering if it can run more than 1 GB, IT CAN!! So if you have a dell dimension 2400 this is defiantly what you want."
4,"Great book, especially for coaches","I'm not a coach, and I haven't comletely read the book, but I've browsed through it in stores before. There's a lot of information and diagrams about situational plays. For example, one page will say ""1st and 2nd, ball hit to right field on the ground"" or something like that. Then it will show where each player should go (cutoff position, base, etc.) There is also information about each individual position (about a few pages). I'd recommend it for players and coaches."
2,IT FLATOUT SUCKS! 3.5 OUT OF 10,"At first it seemed like this game was going to be fun, then you see it's disastrous gameplay unfold and unleash the hell that lies beneath it. To start off the controls freaking suck to a large extent. When aiming your sniper rifle for example, you will notice how it won't seem to stay on target, like it's being weighed down by something heavy so aiming for your target is too damn hard. Your grenades can be useless too because when you throw them they can roll down a hill even if they are spot on to a enemy which made this game even more infuriating play. The gameplay is total crap as well! Yay! IT PLAYS LIKE AN INCREDIBLY POORLY MADE ROLE-PLAYING GAME BECAUSE YOU AND YOUR ENEMY TAKE TURNS TRYING TO KILL EACH OTHER. Aside from the broken gameplay, broken camera, and broken controls the only positive thing I can find in this game is the humor, that's the only damn thing that's good. Oh yeah, war is hell alright, hell if you're playing this broken game."
1,Terrible,"This is one of the worst games ever. The concept is interesting but it plays so slow. War games should be fast, like the army men games. But this thing moves at a snails pace, very boring. Buy at your own risk."
2,"Buy it, but only to pay them for Felt Mountain","The only reason to purchase this record is to help Goldfrapp make up for the relatively small sales of Felt mountain, which was a brilliant record. Heck, buy Black Cherry too, as it was an excellent record. Supernature is, however, bland, rambling and uninspired."
2,"""Fly Me Away"" to ... Felt Mountain","You know I love Goldfrapp and that's why I was highly disappointed with this album. When I was first introduced to this group I thought how amazing they were. First there was ""Felt Mountain"" which I consider in my top five, a thoroughly amazing album! Ambient, Dark, weird with a touch of winter trip-hop. Then came ""Black Cherry"" a 180 degree turn from ""Felt Mountain"". It was everything that ""Felt Mountain"" was not - lustful, glam, with a touch of 80's Electo-rock. A fantastic album in it self, though not as brilliant as ""Felt Mountain"".""Supernature"" - Goldfrapp's Pop Hour. This album I like to think of as ""Black Cherry"" part 2 or a lesser version of that album. Moving towards dance remix land and pop. This album sits on the edge of alternative and mainstream. Much too polished and not interesting enough to keep you sticking around.Sadly this is a throw-away album from a fantastic band."
5,GoldFrappiccino....!,"One of the best dance/electronic albums I've ever heard. A masterful blend of thumping grooves, hypnotizing rhythms and silky vocals."
1,Terrible.,A total sell out album. Felt Moauntain is by far the best Goldfrapp album. Thisn album sucks.
1,this + black cherry = the 2 biggest disappointments of my life.,"the days of felt mountain are gone forever! Long-live the trend-following(damn electro revivel), sleazy & uninspired goldCrapp they've become(OH! Except that just let it take you song...that one is the best song ever made) :) :) :! :! :( :("
5,Sexy and Fun!,"Its a rarity that I become smitten with a cd from the get go. However, Supernature caught me and won't let go. Its in heavy rotation in my car and on my MP3. I feel like I should be cruising down the highway on a warm summer day with the top down on my convertible. Its sexy and fun and I totally recommend it if you are a fan of the song Strict Machine."
5,Makes me want to buy a winnebago.,"I've been a fan since the beginning. This is a culmination/continuation of the first two albums and it's just perfect. Great pop that references and respects T. Rex, Gary Numan, Moroder, Kraftwerk... It sounds great on radio or a party but the real treat is on headphones. Production is velvet. And I've had the import for months - just gets better and more infectious. The special edition is well worth it. And I saw them on their teaser show in NYC at Nokia Theater. They rocked. (it was a star studded affair and i saw some big stars with mouths dropped) Wind machine companies owe Alison royalties. Enjoy!"
2,THE CHILD DEVIANT,"I have no intention of blasting Goldfrapp completely out of the water, though I must admit...this is the official ""sell Out"" album by this band. Yes, the beats are catchy, and there are some neat tracks...but the lyrics are kinda blase...perhaps they are subliminal...I don't know. One thing I do know, is that Goldfrapp has suddenly become the background music to various car, cell phone, and Ipod televison commercials...and for that reason alone....I think I'm starting to dislike this album. I strongly suggest that if your new to Goldfrapp....you select Felt Mountain as your introduction to this band. If you have eccentric taste in music...this particulur album will probably just annoy you. It's basicly just another modern day disco album with verry little substance."
2,Repetitive boring electronica.,"The album is sterile, cold, dull, repetitive electronica, with a passionless vocal track. If that's what you like, you'll like this. It doesn't do anything for me. It doesn't repel me (like rap), but provides nothing of interest for future listening."
3,Goldfrapp Lite,"With the release of Supernature, it is obvious that Goldfrapp are concerned mainly with winning over new fans who hadn't previously heard of them before. Upon first listen, these songs immediately grab you with the plethora of hooks and catchy vocals this album displays. After repeated listens, however, these songs begin to lose their initial allure. I own all three Goldfrapp albums, and this album definitely ranks lowest. Although boasting tighter production and more (but not much more) PR, it is no substitute for the creativity and beauty that Goldfrapp's music showcased on Felt Mountain and Black Cherry.This is not a bad album, it's just not a very original album. This is Goldfrapp Lite."
4,Supernatural,"Goldfrapp is an awesome band and I respect them for taking risks and doing different things with their music. However, I must be honest when I say this cd is not as a great as Felt Mountain, but it is better than Black Cherry. On this album, the music can only be described as ""out-of-space glam"". Songs like 'Ooh La La' has the appeal of a purring dance party, while 'Ride A White Horse' pumps funk to keep the party going. The haunting 'Let It Take You' slows the music down, while 'Koko' relives Kate Bush from the 80s. My only issue with this cd is its not as cutting edge as Felt Mountain. However, because Goldfrapp still beats to their own drum, they probably won't find an audience here in America. Only a few music lovers who wants something different, like myself, will take a risk on Goldfrapp.On another note, Madonna took alot of her styles on her Confession On the Dancefloor from this group. So I think fans who love music owe it to themselves to check this group out."
5,Supernature will fly you away,"This deluxe edition worth every penny. Great 5.1 mix with photos, videos and live footages. Erotic pulsing beats, very catchy certainly not ""Pop"" or mainstream. Interesting and underwhelming record."
4,Blondie meets Kylie meets Fischerspooner,"This record has a sound like no other. Goldfrapp has done a phenomenal job of putting together a smooth and brilliant sound that is perfect for lounging to at a cocktail party, listening to on a treadmill, listening to while lounging on a couch, or blaring on a crowded dance floor.The sound is difficult to label, electro-synth heavy, with vocals that range from soft to husky. The tracks are both up- and down-tempo, with stnad outs including ""Ride a White Horse"", ""Slide In"" and ""Satin Chic"" (my personal favorite).This is one of the most memorable and repeat-listen worthy records I have heard since Kylie's Fever and Gwen Stefani's Love Angel Music Baby. The genre is electro-dance, but fans of pop, rock and lounge music will fall in love with the sound and catchy beats of Goldfrapp."
4,Mixed Bag,"I found every song here to really great or very bad. I love Madmen for God, Devi, Jaya, Om Mani, and Meeting Rivers. This is definately worth a spin. The tracks I listed have a great vibe and will make you happy!"
2,Disappointing worldbeat,"I bought this CD with very high expectations, hoping that this would be another great example of Indian-inflected worldbeat. Unfortunately, I was wrong. While two tracks on the album--Devi and Jaya--are well thought out and played, most of the other songs are too diluted, commercial, or slick-sounding to be substantial contributions to the subgenre.Too bad. This could possibly have been much better, but when you have a song with lyrics like ""Strange, strange world, it's incredible"", or ""Endless sea of hope, unlock the mysteries"", you know you're very likely in for a bumpy ride. The musicianship is actually quite good in places--the sarangi master Ramesh Mishra certainly gives it his all--but here, the whole is decidedly less than the sum of its parts.A good one to pass up."
5,13 Going on 30,"Ruby Tuesday is a coming-of-age novel and an excellent first novel. The characters are well-drawn, especially Ruby, her absentee mother Darlene and her tough grandmother Nana Sue. Even the pet iguana has personality! The plot takes off when Ruby's handicapper Dad Hollis is accused of murdering his bookie. After that it's difficult to put the book down. The seamy Las Vegas underworld is described to a T. Some scenes are laugh-out-loud funny, especially the beach wedding with the bride in a white bikini. I highly recommend Ruby Tuesday for ages 13-83. I'm looking forward to Jennifer's next book."
2,I cansee why The O'Jays objected to this CD's release.,"I can truly understand why The O'Jays objected so strongly to this CD's release--the music is definitely inferior to most of the group's other (released) recordins. If you are a truly hard-core O'Jays fan you may like this CD but I do see why Eddie LeVert urged the group's fans not to buy it as it's made up of ""Rejects""."
5,Good OEM part,"Good OEM part need I say more? Works great on my 1996 Impala SS, supposedly a little more reliable than than the stock part. I'd go with this if you have an automatic or 5 speed LT1. I'm still on the original valve in my 97 6Speed Trans Am with approx 150k miles."
5,Miss these guys...,"I came to the party late as far as Smalltown Poets were concerned, having first heard them when a friend lent me the brilliant Third Verse CD a couple years ago. Christendom's answer to the Gin Blossoms, all of their CDs feature well-crafted tunes, well-performed. I've since tracked down all of their CDs and enjoy them immensely. I encourage you to check 'em out! Highlight's on this particular release for me are Upside Down and Here."
2,"Half okay, half great","Audrey's Rain started out with swearing right out of the shoot. It has a good story, but was disappointed in the many instances of swearing. Life on Libery Street was better, no swearing, but maybe a little uncomfortable for those that are not used to the mentally handicapped. But it does have a great story line."
5,Stephen McHattie IS James Dean,Stephen McHattie stars in the best bio-pic of James Dean created so far. It is quite an early but factual account of the 50's screen legend. This movie really started my interest in James Dean which continues to this day. Although he only made three films his tragic death has had a profound effect on millions of people. McHattie's performance captures the charisma and charm. Since seeing it on BBC in the 1980's I have been looking for the film. Only on Amazon was I able to find it. A rare gem which should be seen by anyone who has had a picture of James Dean on their wall.
4,Video Review,"Length:: 2:15 MinsI hope that by doing a video review, I am giving others a better glimpse inside the book. This is an excellent book for anyone looking to create an outdoor space.Enjoy-"
2,A book for the unimaginative,A fair book - I suppose if you have no imagination - have never looked at another landscaping book - or a new to the concepts. Nothing new in here - so that's where I was disappointed.
2,Great movies......BUT BEWARE!,When watching the movie I noticed the logo Platinum Disc at the bottom right hand corner of the screen and it would not go away even after the movie started. The menu has no setup to get rid of it and worse than that the logo was underlined in red so it was a real eye sore to watch the movie. I would have never bought it if I knew that. Love the movies but hate the logo.
4,Calming and Intriguing,"I read this book to prepare for a term paper this semester -- stumbled upon it at the library merely by chance, and I'm glad that I did. Moore takes an unusual look at the soul, drawing upon Renaissance thinking and Greek archetypes as well as his own experiences in the Catholic church. It's easy to follow and inspirational to read."
2,Half good/half bad,"The concept of valuing what makes us human and befriending our true selves is fascinating. Moore writes with eloquence and is thought-provoking, but he has obviously never suffered from depression (to which he devotes a chapter) and this raises doubt as to the credibility of the remainder of the book. Depression is not some kind of poetic melancholy or boredom. It is a deep pit of despair where reality is distorted beyond recognition. The only thing I have learned from depression is to fear and distrust it. I have retrieved this book from the trash because the final chapters intrigue me, but I will read it with skepticism."
1,Extremely boring,I love books but this book is seriously boring. I was swayed by the 5-star reviews but I found absolutely no tangible value in the content.
1,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this book as I thought it would address spirituality in a humanistic way. At first, I thought I agreed with the 'accepting of self' philosophy, but gradually statements made by the author just didn't ring true. I kept on thinking that maybe I was resistant to the reevaluation of my own thought processes, but gave up when the author spoke of a patient who found out her husband was cheating on her and the author's response was that she had control issues (!?!) and was acting like a victim. I think at that moment, perhaps she feeling victimized. But instead of telling her to 'embrace her victim', she is a control freak. Then he presents depression like it is some kind of choice, instead of a chemical imbalance. Perhaps depression can spawn creativity, but you have to be able to get out of bed first -- and that is a problem. I gave up on the book after that."
5,A Beautiful Work,"This book, while a challenging read due to it's academic bent, was a pleasure from beginning to end, and changed my life. It helped me to make significant inroads into removing chronic depression from my life, and opened up my eyes to a new way of living. I owe much to Thomas Moore."
5,Nonfiction for the literary lover,"Being a student of classical literature, I have very rarely found nonfiction that can speak in the same language to which I am accustomed. This book is deeply profound and challenging--perhaps the most evocative approach to psychology I have ever encountered.It is especially helpful to those who enjoy literature. It is artistic and aesthetic, yet still very, very helpful for practical use and everyday living. I have found myself challenged deeply towards personal and spiritual fulfillment, and have been recommending the book to everyone that I know.My husband and I read it together and are continuing to sift through its richness. No other book has been able to so completely shift my spiritual and psychological paradigm effectively. This is a must read."
5,Care of the Soul,"I purchased Care of the Soul so that I could have my own copy after returning the copy of Care of the Soul that I had borrowed from the library. The author's approach is best suited for a reader who is highly educated and can benefit from the author's skillful, extensive usage of Greek mythology and psychological in-depth principles. The average person who is attracted to the book's title ""Care of the Soul: a Guide for Cultivating Depth and Sacredness in Everyday Life"" would not find this book to be a simple, down-to-earth practical ""common sense"" type of self-help ""manual for everyday living."" For those who can understand and appreciate the author's approach and insights, this is a very valuable and worthwhile book."
3,Inspiring ideas/Mediocre writing,"When I read the introductory chapter to this book, I was overcome by the notion that what I held in my hand might be about to change my life. Then, what could have been profound was muddled by poor structure and incoherent arguments. I mean, I agreed with most of Moore's ideology and still I found myself rolling my eyes at his arguments! No wonder so many reviewers here completely missed the point! The worst were his constant, generalized analogies to mythology. The myths DID have relevance to his points but AGAIN, his actual writing destroys conherence. For those thinking about reading this, look at the value of what is trying to be expressed rather than the way it is expressed. It is worth reading if you've the patience."
4,nurture yourself...,"a very insightful book on tending to your own garden, that is your soul. This book is beautifully written and thought provoking. With wonderful lessons in nurturing your daily life and finding the sacredness in day to day living that will deepen your own soul experience."
4,Fast & Furious,The books were received in good condition and very fast. These were ordered for a group of people and all appreciated the quickness that the books were sent out.
2,A few gems in the trash,This is my second book by Moore that I've read. I have found him to be an alternative thinker. He writes some great things criticizing the course of modern society however some of his positions on morals are just unthinkable for a former monk. I agree with the reviewer who questions Moore's advice to the women whose husband was cheating on her. I've found some good insights while digging through this earthy volume.
1,Thoroughly irrelevant,"I bought this book without hesitation, and I regret it. After the GREAT book Journey of Souls by Michael Newton, I have become very interested in matters of the soul. Care of the Souls does nothing but rehash ancient mythology without applying any analysis to real life people. I don't know how anyone could find this book aspiring. Aspired by what? One chapter talks about how one should be depressed from time to time for the fuller understanding of the soul. I cannot remember the last time that I was depressed about anything. I've have made choices in life that have made me very happy. Why would I be depressed? Does that make me less aware of my soul? Absolutely not! I found the author to be very well read; however, he does not have the SLIGHTEST idea who he is or what a soul is. He is clearly unaware of his."
5,A life-changing book,"I whole-heartedly recommend this book to anyone interested in making their live more meaningful and purposeful. My fiance and I have been reading this book together and discussing it for several months. I have found it to be one of the most profound books I ever read; one worth reading slowly and savoring. Moore's ideas about creating sacred places and meaningful rituals in the midst of our increasingly secular and materialistic culture have been life-changing. His message that the path to developing depth (soulfulness) is not to reject one's preceived faults and weaknessess but rather to embrace them as unique and critical aspects of one's self has been a wonderful alternative to the ""fake it 'till you make it"" spirituality of my upbringing."
2,"Pretentious, dry and BORING!","I excitedly bought this book after hearing wonderful things about it from friends, fellow students and teachers. I was profoundly disappointed. Moore never actually guides one through ""cultivating depth and sacredness"". He lectures about subjects that the average reader cares little about. There are a great many books out there that are infinitely more accessible to the common reader. I suggest that they be sought out. This book is thoroughly unenjoyable."
3,The spirit revealed ....,"Thomas Moore enters into the realm of spirit in this book, and he takes the reader with him on this wonderful journey through the human soul. I never quite thought of the soul in the way it is presented here, but having reflected on Thomas Moore's path to enlightenment via the soul, I have to admit I found much to think about in this book. In an extraordinarily imaginative way, we learn the myriad aspects of how to care for our souls. This book teaches, entertains, and provides us with a plan of action to begin working on recognizing the soul's need for attention. Parts of the book were a bit dry, but overall this is a deeply spiritual and emotionally penetrating book."
2,Biggs lost it,"Once, early in his career, Biggs was a fantastic organist. Unfortunately: his technique declined early; he was taken over by the HIP movement to a significant extent; and, most unfortunately, severely progressive rheumatoid arthritis started early in his career (worse, the treatment he received resulted in his death). Still, there are many Biggs recordings that are very good, and mostly impossible to find: Hindemith Concerti; Hindemith Sonatas; Handel Concerti; Rheinberger Concerti (made late in his life -- played better than any that are available). But his Bach -- unimaginative, labored, very close to boring.John Turner"
2,Naked violence,I was looking for some old 70 gems with some exploitation in them. theses do not come close one of these movies is in black and white. I didn't make it far enough to know if there was any character build up or plot. The movie couldn't hold my attention.
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!,"WE AINT GOIN NOWHERE!!!!!!!!this song is 1 of the best songs that P Diddy has ever written.i think that this song is better that the whole of STEPS songs put together!!! and trust me, thats enough 2 send u BALLISTIC!!! altogether i think that P DIDDY has writen another amazing song!"
5,Feats Don't Fail,"Excellent live Little Feat from their prime. Great look at the interaction between the band members. Looks good and sounds great. If you're a Feat fan, this one's for you."
4,Fantastic!,I ordered the DVD for my birthday and it was great. It took me back to a time that made me feel happy and free. I loved it!!!
5,Little Feat live concert,"As a long time fan of Little Feat I didn't know this existed and am delighted to have a copy. Waiting for Columbus, the classic live recording was made weeks after this performance. Lowell George was fabulous both singing and his excellent slide guitar work. I had never seen Lowell actually playing which was a treat. The whole band was tight with some of the best musicians in the business. If you like the Feat this is a must have."
5,can't get enough FEAT,Why is band not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?a redone video but with extras.great for anyone who missed LITTLE FEAT with Lowell Georgethis is rock an roll done right
4,Good Show,"Not necessarily the best video quality but that's not this products fault. Just an old show. Great performance, good song selection."
5,Price Soars As Amelia,"This recording of ""Un Ballo in Maschera"", made for RCA in 1966, is first rate. Despite earlier comments to the contrary, the 39-year old Leontyne Price is still very much in her prime here and does some really terrific singing and acting. Carlo Bergonzi is an excellent Riccardo, full of lightness and elegance and humor. Reri Grist is the perfect page, in lovely voice with flawless high notes. The always wonderful Shirley Verrett, though a mezzo, sings the contralto role of Ulrica with firm tones and excellent musicianship. There was a comment that Robert Merrill was past his prime here. I can tell you that he is in better voice for this recording than he was for the Traviata he made with Joan Sutherland in 1962. I was amazed at just how good he sounded and what an all around fine job he did. I also own the Ballo with Pavarotti and Margaret Price, et al. Even though Pavarotti is a fabulous Riccardo, the RCA recording is superior overrall, especially because of Leontyne Price."
2,For Bergonzi... but not Price!,"Au début des années 60, Decca a sorti un Bal masqué avec un Bergonzi à la fois lumineux et incisif mais sous la direction hautement discutable de Solti -dont la conception analytique du son se trouvait d'autant plus accentuée que c'était le péché mignon des ingénieurs du son de Decca. En 1966 RCA sort son propre Bal masqué avec Bergonzi qui n'a rien perdu de ses qualités. La direction de Leinsdorf, précipitée mais sans la brutalité de Solti est homogène. Malheureusement Amelia est Leontyne Price, une chanteuse avec certes un superbe timbre mais chez qui l'intuition remplace trop souvent la technique. On a donc des moments pénibles où la partition est tellement malmenée que l'on ne peut que penser à un immense gchis."
3,"Price isn't at her best, and Leinsdorf is Leinsdof","Leontyne Price had two late shots at greatness with her second Aida and this Un Ballo, both sunk by the wooden, unfeeling conducting of Erich Leinsdorf. In both performances her incomparable voice isn't at its best, simply becasue of age, yet her tenor partners--Domingo in the Aida, Carlo Bergonzi here--ae certainly very good.I am not able to listen to Verdi simply for great singing. There has to be a guiding spirit on the podium, and Leinsdorf is utterly without spirit. As Renato, Robert Merrill is past his prime and does a blustery job. So even though I admire the two lead singers--and everyone else in the cast is good if not superlative--I much prefer the live 1975 La Scala perfrmance with Carreras and Caballe, both in great voice, that can be bought for a song on the Opera d'Oro label."
5,Excellent ! Really addictive.,"I wasn't expecting much, but this album really got me. Great lyrics (if you know Portuguese) and excellent songs. Really addictive."
4,Just like having 2 keyboards!,"Excellent!I used to write in a ""virtual"" keyboard.Now I feel the difference: I am typing in a magic two languages keyboard!My old English one and the brand new Russian! Wow ! Why did I take so long to discover this ?Applying doesn't take more than minutes. And you can immediately enjoy your Russian Cyrillic-English keyboard, instead of clicking to call the small virtual one. Great! And, better...cheap."
3,"Good adhesive, bad design.","Overall, not a bad product. They really stick to the keyboard, and sure beat cutting letters out by hand. They fit well on a netbook keyboard. However, there are two issues:1. The letters come stamped out of a plastic sheet, attached to a backing paper. However, when the letter outlines were stamped out, so was the paper. This means that about 1/3 of the letters come off with a thin layer of paper stuck to the adhesive side. It is difficult to peel off. I resolved this by using a razor blade to gently pick at the edge of the letter, so that just the plastic part comes off.2. For keys F and J, there is no allowance for a little bump on the keyboard. So, have to use a razor to slice off approximately 1/2 of the clear part of the sticker, so that it fits.In the end, they worked for me just because I don't have time to order a new set. It took me 45 minutes to attach all the letters. I think there are better alternatives."
2,Not quite accurate description,"The decals are NOT transparent. On the keyboards I put them on, they dull the background keys significantly. I do not recommend them except in urgent situations, or where you have no idea where the Russian keys are."
1,Cryllic Script too Big to be usefull,"I purchased cryllic letters for new HP Laptop. My new laptop keyboard has english alphabet exactly in center of keys. Because of the large size of cryllic stickers they will not work without covering english letters and making chinese gibberish. If you purchase these large stickers, make sure your keyboard has its factory letters offset into a corner. Otherwise your money is wasted just like mine was!These cryllic letter stickers are too large."
1,Russian transparent keyboard stickers,I was forced throw it away because it was impossible to take them out of the paper in order to put on my keyboard.
1,do not buy!!! waiste of money,i purchased this stickers for their color and free shipping. I wanted letters to contrast with my english letter. BUT sticker wont come off from the paper. I come out only with paper stuck to tha back so it took me about an hour to clean them. And still i had to through away some of them. very dissapointed
1,RUSSIAN CYRILLIC KEYBOARD STICKERS WITH RED LETTER...,"Looks not good on black keyboard, red letter shall look on white field much better. I did that on my keyboard by myself."
3,Scotch tape but functional,"Standard stickers with a clear background and red letters. They don't match the size of the keys on my laptop, look smaller. The worst part - you can see it's stickers on the keys. Like scotch tape. Not attractive but functional."
2,Shipping charges preposterous,"My only advice is to watch and compare the shipping charges. I did not notice that shipping for this was $7.44. As the item is the size and weight of a postcard this is a farce. Total purchase price was $7.94, with item cost 49 cents."
2,"Poorly made, but servicable","Stickers are very hard to take off, tend to bubble when you put them on. Also not easy to see if your keyboard isn't under direct light. Shop around. Really, you're getting what you pay for. Also somewhat confusing where certain letters/symbols go, but that can be looked up."
4,Works well enough,"The Cyrillic stickers cover Russian, Ukrainian, etc. The actual application to your (recently cleaned!) keyboard will prove a bit tricky as the stickers often either didn't want to separate cleanly from the backing or the cut around the sticker wasn't completely clean. Grab an Xacto blade, scalpel or similar sharp implement to work around this little problem.Overall the stickers work really well once applied to your keyboard."
3,The stickers are not bad.,"In short words, the stickers are not exactly transparent; in addition, it takes lots of time to attach all of them."
3,You get what you pay for,"These keyboard stickers are OK at best. The best thing about them is the price, but, as always, you get what you pay for. First and foremost, it's REALLY hard to peel them off the backing without damaging the sticky side and thereby making them less sticky or ruining one of the corners. Oftentimes, a thin layer of paper sticks to the plastic sticker when you try to remove it from the backing, and it's very hard to get it off. Second, as another reviewer pointed out, they are not really transparent, at least not on a black keyboard. You can see the letters pre-printed on your keys through these stickers; however, your keys will look as if they are sprikled with a whitish powder. That being said, these stickers are serviceable and I expect them to last a few months."
5,Very original !,I saw Señor Carranza perform Nov 2001 in San Jose Costa Rica at the Jazz Café. He was amazing and very original. If you have a chance to see him do it. His two CD's are great.
4,So glad I was able to find this!,"I have used this product for over 5 years and was so sad when Garnier decided not to make it anymore. Thank goodness for this vendor! I received my order in 7 days (now UPS is a completely different story)as expected. One bottle of this will last me over a month (and I have long, wavy, hair)."
2,picture of product is deceiving,"I have used the Garnier Fructis shake effect ligui-effect for years. When I found this on this site was excited. BUT, what I received is different bottle and different name. If company changed bottles and names it should be noted on the sellers site and picture changed. Will try it as I hate the hastle of return.I was disappointed in this vendor but after talking to him he resolved the issue to my satisfaction. Will likely use this vendor again. Would also give 5 stars. thanks"
4,Generally great; a few annoyances,"This is a great book. The proofs are clearly presented, and generally it is easy to understand the motivation behind definitions and theorems. Exercises are relevant, interesting, and well designed, often allowing the reader to discover things that other texts describe in dull detail. Unfortunately, a few exercises (such as ""Integration Theory: Junior Grade"") seem to pop out of nowhere. I consider this a minor defect. A much larger annoyance is that Kelley defines partial and linear orders in an utterly non-standard and somewhat clumsy way, which ends up affecting a large number of exercises. If you already know something about orderings, you will encounter many surprises; if you know nothing about them, you may get the wrong idea."
2,May have been good in its day,"I cannot agree with the other reviewers on this. Back in the days when there were hardly any general texts on topology this may have been good. Nowadays there are at least a dozen such that are far better than this. The printing fonts and layout are spidery and primitive and not easy on the eye. The style is rather formal and dry for a subject as rich as this and little effort is put into illustrating the material with background, diagrams or examples. As I said before there is no shortage of better texts amongst which Hocking & Young is worth special mention."
3,Alice Neel Video,"I was a little disappointed by this video. Although I can appreciate the ""no frills"" approach, I felt that there was something lacking. The footage consists mostly of Neel around the studio, chatting with friends and family (mostly about stuff other than her work); there is some great stuff, but because it is largely unedited, you've got to sit through the whole 2 hours to catch the gems. The black and white footage is beautiful, but because of the nature of her work, I found myself longing for color (that's just a personal bias). This one is great for people already VERY familiar with Neel and her work. I bought it to show to one of the classes I teach, but decided not to because absolutely NO background information is given on Neel and her work--this is purely old film footage. Being a big Neel fan, I enjoyed watching it, but I am not sure it was worth the hefty price tag."
3,Entertaining...(3 1/2 stars),"Fiend is the 3rd installment in JJ's vamp series. I have to say out of them all, VOTB was my fave, but Fiend, IMHO, was waaay better then Wounds. Fiend focused on Orfeo...his human life, his creation and life as a vampire, and his relationship with Daniel. The book held my interest, but I have to say that some of it put me off a little...it was at times just too graphic for me. Still, Fiend was a good read and I will definitely keep a look out for more of this authors work."
4,Give it a week,"This is not the first time I have used this item and what I have learned is that you have to give it a about a week to stiffen up and really work the way it is supposed to. During the first week, the flap may not settle over the pipe correctly and water escapes so the toilet keeps running. Next time, if I remember, maybe I will soak it in water for a week before I install it and then it will work great right from the start. After that first week, it is reliable and works consistently. Also, I had trouble when it is brand new getting the thin back piece to fit into the correct groove, but after a week and trying again, it clicked in securely and that is probably what made the most difference in its proper operation."
1,Will not work on older models,Fail to tell you that it will not work on older Rialto models until you get it.
1,Does not work,"I tried and returned three of these to my local hardware store. They simply do not work. I figured out that if you buy the original Kohler part, it works as intended and I haven't had a problem since."
1,terrible performance by BIC Superstore,"I ordered this item on April 24. BIC Superstore did not ship it until May 3 so the earliest I will get it is on May 10, which will be 16 days after the order was placed and payment was made. I will never order anything from BIC Superstore again. If they are out of stock of an item they should state this on the Amazon web page and not be taking orders for a week with no product to sell."
2,Thumbs down on Kohler Toilets,Never had such an issue with a toilet before my Kohler purchase. Stick with the lowest line of Toto and it's still superior to a Kohler toilet
3,duh,"its a flapperwhat kind of review do you think it deservesif you need it...buy itif you dont, dontwhy are you even reading this"
5,Great Kohler replacement but make sure it looks exactly as the one in the tank,"If you have a single piece Kohler toilet and do not know the model number, I highly recommend taking a lid off of your water tank and seeing if this flapper looks like the one in there. If they match visually then chances are this is a right replacement part. Worked like a charm in my mom's toilet. The warranty period is 5 years, so buy a few of them as they are absolutely not available in any local hardware stores."
5,Works good,Couldn't find a good replacement for my kohler flapper at Home Depot. The universal one leave much to be desired.This one is a exact replacement.
3,"Good fun, but a bit annoying at times.","This game is pretty fun, with not-so-good graphics, but hey, for ten bucks, that's pretty good. The first level is fun, but the second seems nearly impossible. I had a guy die and had his ghost walk around the second level world, and it seems impossible to kill all the glores and whatnot around there. If you've gotten farther, you must spend more time than I do on this game. Oh well, I hope that at least YOU have a good time with this game."
1,Ugh,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. THERE ARE MUCH BETTER ALTERNATIVES. IF you are simply looking for a cheap game go ahead, but do not waste your hard earned money on this when there are so many better options out there."
4,Great looking watch,"This a very nice watch I like the way it looks it is a little heavy but is easy to adjust wrist band,the day does not keep up it fails to advance properly and the stop watch function buttons stick and are hard toget to reset,"
1,This Is A Break-Away Album?,"Jonatha Brooke has left Jennifer Kimball, but it doesn't sound as if Jennifer Kimball is quite through with Jonatha Brooke. This album sounds just like one of her old partner's solo efforts. Not much break-away here, nor anything we haven't heard before from the red-head."
5,I wonder...,"As a product of the Joni M, Karla Bonoff, Bonnie Raitt, Wendy Waldman et al, generation, it's hard for me to understand why Ms. Kimball's music hasn't made a bigger splash. Her music has depth, yet her melodies stick with you like good pop songs. Her lyrics appeal to my sense of past intimacies and emotional rememberences. I suspect that it's just a generational 'thing'. I like thoughtful and complex music and I grew up with it. If you did the same, you'll love this..."
3,HUGE Story fan...a little let down...,"I LOVE The Story and Jennifer solo is not far from that path. However, my disappointment has to do more with the quality of the songs. Love her voice, but the songs just don't motivate me to listen to the CD. Bummer! Hope she keeps trying with some better songs."
5,Garfunkle outshines Simon,"This CD has been in high rotation for me since it came out. I was a fan of the Story and was disappointed by their breakup. I was further disappointed by Jonatha Brooke's solo albums (own them both; listen to neither). Jennifer Kimball's Veering from the Wave was an unexpected delight! Favorite tracks: ""It's a long way home,"" ""World without end,"" and ""Veering from the wave."" I've been lucky enough to see her live twice and I recommend it. It has often been noted that Jonatha wrote the songs for The Story. All I can say is that Garfunkle has outshown Simon this time."
4,Genesis on Bible Prophecy,"Another good prophecy book by Pastor Hagee. In this one, he covers 30 Revelations of Truth that we can find in the book of Genesis. From the Garden of Eden, to Joseph, and how it relates to prohecies fulfilled and those yet to be fulfilled. Hagee demonstrates a deep study and knowledge of the Hebrew culture. He also describes the 7 ages of Dispensation. From the Age of Creation to the Age to Come, the Kingdom of God. Worth picking up this book, if you are interested in Bible Prophecy and the book of Genesis."
2,Sean Granger commentary,What is interested to the educated reader (Christian) is the author's use of the formed Earth in describing how the modern science and the book of Genesis do not condridict one another. That and the idea of the pink elephant . . .
5,"Brilliant, Readable, and Profound","""Brilliant, readable, and profound ... concerned with the broadest and deepest questions about our history."" -- J. Morgan Kousser. ""One of the most important books ever written about the politics of race in the United States."" -- Tyler Anbinder. ""Superb ... exhaustive [and] convincing."" -- James M. McPherson. ""Extraordinary and sophisticated. [The author] is one of the most meticulous historians in the business."" -- John Lauritz Larson. ""A model for both political historians and students of nineteenth century race relations."" -- Albert S. Broussard."
2,"If You Want a Christmas Movie for Kids, It's OK","If you expect Leslie Nielsen to stop his trademark bumbling slapstick acting which he showed in his ""Naked Gun"" series; and if you buy the idea of Santa with amnesia, give another star and make it three. As I don't either, excuse me for my low rating.So, if you want to buy a Christmas present for your kids, and thinking about a harmless and amusing one, ""Santa Who?"" will do. It is good-natured, and though slightly sexual relationship is implied (between the two adults), it is nothing you might be embarrassed with when watching it with kids.However, if you seek for more profound and thought-provoking one, how about ""Miracle on 34th Street""? Both the original and the remake (featuring Natalie Wood and Mara Wilson respectively, and they are so cute!!) are great, I assure you."
4,Scrooge the Musical,"I have the film version of Scrooge the musical with Albert Finney and all those other wonderful actors/actresses and have watched this film many times, I fell in love with the wonderful music and have wanted to buy the cassette/cd ever since I bought the film. I must admit to being somewhat disappinted with the cd with Tony Newley and the rest of the cast of the stage show, it just does not live up to the music from the film. BUT I shall play it any way because of my love for the musical score. ..."
1,"If You've Seen The Albert Finney Film, Don't Buy This","For all of you who carry the memories and the magic from the 1970 original musical film of Scrooge, this ""production"" will destroy that magic. Anthony Newly is indeed, wrongly cast, and is an absolutely horrendous, egotistical and overdone [his style] obscenity to the gorgeous songs of Leslie Bricusse and to Albert Finney's characterization of such."
2,"Why, oh WHY would anyone want a CD of this show?","After appearing in Scrooge two years in a row I have more than a passing acquaitance with the score; I am honestly at a loss to explain why anyone would want to own a recording of it! The only worthwhile song in the entire thing is the beautifully-arranged opening, and one would feel awfully silly listening to it in April. I really can't understand why you would want it . . but if you do you do, there's no accounting for taste, i suppose."
4,Scrooge,I'd always wanted a soundtrack for that movie and this is what I found. It has a pretty good sound.
4,Very good adaption,"Whether the 1970 movie was created from the musical, or the musical was created from the 1970 film is unknown..but what is known is that this musical is very enchanting. From its beautiful opening song ""Sing a Christmas Carol"", to Ebenezer Scrooge's realization and change of heart in ""I was able to begin again,"" I was captivated through the whole thing. Coming from someone who has performed in A Christmas Carol, it is a great adaption of the Dickens novel."
2,Just OK.,"Anthony Newly is a disapointing ""musical Scrooge"", and is really misses the mark here. Where's the ""Scroogy-ness"" here? And Newly's singing isn't able to give us the transitionof cranky old miser to being filled with the Christmas Spirit. Overall, this version of ""Scrooge"" is OK, but I feel it pales in comparison to the movie soundtrack featuring Albert Finney.Unfortunately, the movie soundtrack is only available on LP I believe, but it's worth it!"
1,Interesting,"I have to agree with my collegues above...this is but a poor reflection of what the movie film conveys. I personally didn't like the ""I hate Christmas"" track either as compared to the ""I hate people"" track from the movie. It definately softened his hatred, which misses the mark completely. Alberty Finney plays an awesome role going from the most bitter and angry scrooge on film to the most jovial and friendly scrooge on film which is what makes the movie so great. As for the music, this disc lacks a passion that the movie disc has.Apparently the CD of the movie musical does exist...there was someone selling it on Ebay and they claim it's not dubbed from an LP or taken from the movie. So who knows ;)"
2,But we WANT the soundtrack from the MOVIE!!!,"The reason for all the negative reviews isn't necessarilly a reflection on the Birmingham cast. It's because the FILM was so wonderful and the songs were spectacular and memorable as done by THAT cast, and everyone is looking for a recording from THAT!!!Unfortunately, unless you get the DVD and hook it up to make your own bootleg recording, there isn't any soundtrack from the film available.This version isn't misleading - it clearly identifies itself as the STAGE soundtrack. But most likely, it isn't what you were looking for.Let us all know when the Albert Finney film cast version is ready! It's long overdue for release."
3,Newley plays Scrooge (about 20 years too late),"As much as I enjoyed Albert Finney in the movie SCROOGE, I had always imagined Anthony Newley in the role. Working with his old partner Leslie Bricusse, Newley finally got a chance to play the role in a theatrical adaptation of the movie. The only trouble is this is the Newley of the early 90's, his voice no longer up to the demands of the role. While Finney talked his way through the film's score, more is expected of Newley and he can't quite pull it off. The orchestration calls for him to reach for notes that were no longer a part of his range and this shows up throughout the recording. Despite these limitations, there is a lot to enjoy on this CD. Newley still entertains throughout and the score has a number of catchy songs (""December the Twenty Fifth,"" ""I Like Life,"" ""Thank You Very Much"") that will leave you singing along. I'm more disappointed in what could have been, but for a true Newley fan this is something you should own."
3,Not What You Expect,"I enjoy this album. It is definitely the work of the force and voice behind Humble Pie. If this is what you are looking for, I highly recommend it.That being said, this CD is not the one that was released in 2000 under the title ""Sing The Blues Live"". I thought it was when I bought it. It has a slightly different name and very different tracks."
2,Not very well done.,"There are several other ""Fireplace"" DVDs that are done much better. Skip this one and get one of the others."
4,Old Favorite,"I have been looking for a copy of this out-of-print book forever. It is one of my all-time favorites. I enjoy all the stories: ""Nightfall"" is of course very good but many of the others are just as intriguing to me. Definitely worth picking up if you can find it."
3,Good Asimov stories,"The book arrived very fast, but it was in poor though readable condition, though for the price was certainly worth it."
5,Joyful Joual!,"This book is great, especially for learners of French. I bought it as a guide to the dialect of Quebec for a project I was doing in my French class and found it fascinating. I am going to study French in Quebec this summer and found that a lot of the phrases this book contains are used there. This book is also wonderful for anyone who is interested in dialectology!"
2,only some words,"when I had opened it,I felt very dissapoint.It is like a mini-dictionary that only has some Canadian French words.and some words in its list are same as French French:(it hasn't CD or Tape to acoompany it so I can't listen,study and compare the pronunciation to ordinary French.it has not writen Quebecois grammar and some more what I want to learn.it give me a little help to know a accent of French,so I give it 2 stars."
4,"Good phone overall, easy to type, mediocre voice and speakerphone","This is my first Blackberry. I bought it specifically for the size and the look. overall it works great - the keyboard while not full QWERTY is easy to use once you get used to it. The LCD is bright and clear. However the voice quality on the phone is mediocre and the speakerphone is not that great. Sometimes its hard to hear the other person, they sound distorted and muffled. I have to ask people to repeat what they say many times. Overall good phone, but wish the phone quality was better"
3,Bought it and returned it,"The phone is nice and small, but the small keyboard makes it tough to type. I like to put my phone in my pocket, this phone is the perfect size for that. The battery cover kept coming off. Not impressed with battery life. I really like the fact that you could start dialing a person by name from the home screen instead of going through address book. Seemed to have software issues (slow). Traded it in for the 8700G could not be happier. Google maps is far superior to the map software in the pearl. I would rate the 8700g with 5 stars."
1,Looks good but Bluetooth disaster,This phone is perfect in many ways but the bluetooth feature is a disaster. There is simply inadequate service connectivity with other items (especially Mac) despite what the manual says. This means it HAS to be synced every time you may want to add a phone numer from your computer or vice versa. No dragging and droppinbg on this phone. No apparent support for industry standard v cards either. A boring issue needing cables etc. I got a free upgrade on this phone in the UK but it's going back to Viodafone and I am going back to Sony Ericsson who also have 'push' email - just like Blackberry!
5,Retired my 8700 and RAZR,"Up until the Pearl, I had one device for e-mail (BB 8700) and another for voice (RAZR). Form factor on the 8700 was the big reason - just too bulky for my suit pocket and the holster was too techie. Loved the RAZR for its size, battery, camera and 'coolness', but the e-mail/browser offering is pitiful. Needed the phone 100% of the time, and the BB not so much, but missed it a lot when I didn't feel like carrying it.Now the Pearl! Great looks, super phone and camera, and all the BB functionality and features a 100+ e-mail per-day person could need. The 8700 was a lot easier to type on, but so is the keyboard on my desktop ;). For me, the ability to send and receive e-mail with 80% of the 8700's ease at 50% of its size, along with everything I loved about the RAZR as a phone, make this the device to have. BTW, I am a Cingular customer. I got the T-Mobile phone unlocked for $40 on eBay."
5,Greatest Wireless Email Device Ever!!!!!,"I have been using a BB since 1999/2000, but was convinced to make a switch to the MOTO Q in May, because I need the camera feature and was tired of carrying around 2 devices. Was also told there would be no BB devices with a camera feature, ever. Hated the MOTO Q. And the $175 early termination fee for leaving VZ for T-Mobile Pearl was the best money I have ever spent. I have had the phone 2 days and it does everything. The phone is BRILLIANT! I was concerned about the typing after using traditional BB typing for so long...well, like I said the phone is brilliant, in only a couple of hours I have mastered it completely. It is a great organizer too, something the Q was not. Again, the greatest Wireless Email device Ever! The camera works great too."
2,Problematic phone!,"The smaller size of this popularBlackBerry 8100 Pearl myFaves Phone (T-Mobile)is very nice, but I found basic functionality of this model very poor. Reception didn't compare to other phones I have, and speaker feedback problems never went away despite swapping 4 phones and 2 SIM cards. Voice dialing recognition was useless. I've moved on to a different model...."
1,Should not be on the market!,"My husband and I both got the Blackberry Pearl with a 2 year plan 3 months ago. We are both on our 3rd phone each. It is ridiculous!!The phone is meant to be a communication tool - well, I cannot hear anything the caller is saying on the headset, unless i use it in speaker mode or use it with the hands free headset.T-Mobile has charged us $9.99 for shipping each time to replace the phone - so we've spent $60.00 on just shipping charges to get a new one each time, only to have it replaced within a month.If you want a stable phone, buy anything but a Blackberry Pearl. Very disappointing."
1,Blackberry is Junk,"I have two Blackberry devices on my plan. The 8100 and the 8130 and both have had the USB connections break. This the charging mechanism for the device and when it goes, it is gone. I didn't buy insurance on the 8100 thinking there was a year warranty. Good luck getting anything fixed under warranty. After being without a phone for over a month, I finally get it back NOT repaired stating customer abuse. They then charged me $55. There are 50 pages on google on the USB failing. This unit was under a year old. The Blackberry USB is just poorly designed. Blackberry has the arrogant mentality that they are the only game in town. The operating system on the blackberry is the most poorly designed I have ever seen. Setup is a pain and almost unmanageable for a novice. Don't waste your money on any blackberry (even the storm). There are many better options and a whole lot less stress. Prediction: BB=chapter 11 three years."
2,useless..,"I only had this phone for a year and experienced soo many problems with it. From numerous dropped calls, battery life only last 1 day if u use the internet alot or listen to music, not receiving numerous text messages, I guess there is some kind of miscommunication btw blackberries network and Tmobile, needed to replace the track ball twice and the battery once and my phone still has problems. Now it randomly shuts off when I make a call longer than 6 minutes, Going in the garbage can when my NEw E71 comes...can't wait to throw this junk away!I'm done with american phones!"
3,Limited Mapping Application,"Just a quick note about the mapping application...Mapping does not allow points of interest searches. You can only input an exact address or select an address from your address book. So, you can't use it to help you find a Starbucks, ATM or other POIs.If you hook it up with a Bluetooth GPS receiver, it will show you were you are on a map. (BlackBerry plans to roll out some tracking services.) However you can't use it for GPS turn-by-turn directions (like TomTom or Garmin) or use it to start your direction request. For directions, you need to input both your starting address and your destination address. It is probably more useful to use a web-based mapping application, like Google mobile maps or Mapquest.But yes, this phone is sleek and sexy."
3,Very unstable phone,I bought this phone a month ago. I think it has major problems with software and stability. I called the technical support and was told that I have to remove the battery and reset it once every 24 hours. Phone suddenly stops ringing or it suddenly stops making calls. If you remove the battery and reset it it will fix itself. Very annoying. The benifits are that it is easy to carry and it easy to sync with your computer and contacts. Hopefully they will improve the next model.
3,The software needs serious attention,"Let me start off by listing the problems with this phone. I have owned it for about a month and tonight all my text messages and call logs were deleted. This happened to me once before and when I called tech support, they told me to take the battery out to reboot the phone.I called again tonight and after they had me reboot it again, my fave5 contacts were corrupted. For starters, only 3 of my 5 show up on the phone and one of them is an old number I changed 3 days ago. The same picture is assigned to all of my contacts. They said there was a known problem with the software. I gave them my phone information and they are supposed to try to re-install my software to see if it helps.Other than the software glitches, the phone works great. Sound quality is very good and it's very easy to type messages on the keypad."
5,Great Reception and Stylish,"Very clear, stylish phone. I don't really know what else to say, I just rank it because when I search for phones I find this rankings very helpful."
2,Don't bother,"I have to say, the looks on the phone is the only thing it has going for it. The signal is always low, the flash doesn't help much, can't disable the shutter noise, CAN'T PLAY ANY VIDEO IF IT'S NOT MPEG-4 SIMPLE PART 2(good luck finding a converter), DOES NOT RECORD VIDEO, the maps feature isn't fully functional if you don't have the additional Bluetooth receiver that doesn't exist, broke 2 already from normal use, had to apply the 5.99 for insurance since I can't trust the quality of the phone to stay working, the instant messager never works properly. Wow I got myself in a 2 year contract just for this phone and it was the stupidest thing I done."
3,No match for a Symbian OS smart phone,"The phone is just OK. The applications are just average for towards standards and the features are sub par. If you are a business user and your company is running BES, then you may like it.Media capabilities are a joke.... but then again it a Blackberry.If you are getting a smart phone get the Symbian OS one."
1,does this deal exist?,"Sorry I have to write this review. This is not peticularly about the phone, for I haven'd received this phone yet! I placed an oder in December 2007. But I was told it was delayed. Then I went to approve this delay, saying I still want it. I was told is was delayed again. .. And again. Someday in middle of January 2008, I got an email from Amazon because my order was cancelled!I went to find another blackberry phone and T-mobile plan, which is almost same thing as the last one, and at Amazon as well. Today I recieved the third email to say my order was delayed. What is the problem of this page? It shows product which doesn't exist at all. How costumer like me who really need a cell phone can trust it??"
3,amazon shoves data plan with the black berry on top,"Hey guys,Just figured that amazon shoves the data plan along with the voice plan you chose. Anyway we can avoid this data plan???Thanks,"
2,"Pearl ... very disappointing ... TREO much, much better","I am not one to write long reviews, so excuse the brief comments. I much prefer the Palm Treo to the Pearl. The Pearl's keyboard stinks, the camera quality is poor and there is problems with the click wheel.I think I will return it."
3,No On/Off Switch,"Who was the idiot that decided to leave out an on/off switch? As a result, whenever there is a problem, you have to remove the back, pull out the battery, wait, reinsert the battery, and wait for about a 2 minute reboot. Reminds me of how long I have to wait for a Microsoft operating system to boot up. This was a huge oversight by some Blackberry engineer. I am glad he's not a brain surgeon - he might have forgotten anesthesia.This device is an OK phone. It does not always pick up all of the email. I don't like the small keyboard (difficult for a man's fingers). Overall, I would not buy this product again."
5,"excellent, pretty neat and light!!!","First time using a Blackberry and this Pearl, the black one is just awesome. Everyone at work is so jealous, and it is nice and handy, cool and can go by as if it was a simple phone (less tempting for it to be stolen I believe, i hope!) but it is very nice. Letters are clear, you can chat on it! I need to buy the case for it if they sell it.Definitely if you are getting a smartphone, or a Blackberry, this one is it."
1,Beware,"Don't choose T-Mobile. I live in Sacramento Ca. I had no coverage in my home. I could never even finish the Blackberry set-up. I also traveled in Minnesota, When I got off the plane at Minneapolis International airport (a major airline hub)I had no coverage there either. I had to use a land line! I used a total of 16 mins. I cancelled within the trial period and was still charged $51.00. Save your money and go with one of the major carriers. I will wait for the i phone."
5,The Best Phone Ever,I have been waiting for ever for this phone for ever. I have been checking all the blackberry sites every day for the last 3 months and finaly on September 12 2006 it came out. And now I have it. This phone is one of thegreatest phones ever!!!!!!I absolutly love this phone...The only downside to this phone is that the little timer is always popping up whenever I switch themes. Oh and for all of you other big fans of Blackberry you can change the theme to the old style of the of the menus and applications. Hope this helps anyone on the edge of buying a Pearl...........
1,Half-baked!!!,"Changed my carrier to try this phone---completely not worth it. Even when phone is ""free"", the data plans are nuts--$100/month on average for data and locked in for years.Suretype stinks for anything but standard dictionary typing---browsing and emails basically required me to shut off the ""feature"".I'm going to return this phone and maybe try out the alternatives: Nokia E62, Moto Q, other Blackberry models or the new Samsung ""BlackJack"" phone out soon.Blackberries are awesome for corporate emails in the normal QWERTY format. Pearl is a major compromise in usability, battery life and stability. Looks are nice, but it's not enough to overcome the other negatives.Maybe Indigo will be the right balance."
4,Refreshing upgrade from other BlackBerry's - Depends on Priorities,"I have had BlackBerry's for years since the ""black and white"" pager style models that didn't even have phones.Over time, I have found that even though I had the large-keyboard units, I typed out relatively short messages, generally, and did not have a use for the detailed keyboard. I did write a memo on a plane one time that when printed was two pages. I would not want to do that on the Pearl.What I can tell you is that if you are needing a phone plus email and not email plus a phone (note the difference), the Pearl is for you. I give it four stars only because it's not perfect; no phone ever has been.PROS: Camera - good. Thin, narron (better than the Q's wide size). I like the pearl instead of the track wheel we're so addicted/used to.Cons: Speakerphone is weak, to be expected for a small phone. Keyboard is too small to write long articles, like this one."
1,"I'm on my 3rd phone and guess what, its broken ...","...I love every part of it if it only would just work, even for once! T-Moblie had now sent me 3 BlackBerry Pearls due to some unexplainable errors and malfunctions. Not my newest one isnn't working anymore ... the track ball is off, it freezes all the time (and I know all the secret tricks to this phone). Just put my sim card back into my 3 year old Nokia that works every time, nothing fancy but at least I can count on it working. T-mobile BlackBerry staff was very nice, spent hours on the phone with them. But obviously the model needs some more development."
4,Phone is very compact with nice screen and keypad,"The pearl is one of the smallest smart phones out there and is very fun to type with and it only takes a few days to get used to it and get fast. The screen is a nice size and has many options, it has a nice media player and support for 2gb micro sd card that is behind the battery. 8/10 because it can be slow starting up and takes a little while to get used too but once you find the shortcuts you will love this phone!"
4,Great Phone but some quirks,"This is the first phone I've had of this kind (s'appelle ""smartphone""), but the battery life is bad when using for email, texts, calls, browsing, etc... when using all day. I don't know if that is the nature of the beast, because I haven't had a phone of this caliber before, but my impressions are that it is a battery drainer. No tech problems at all and it is an all around an awesome phone for any purpose."
5,Understanding Affluenza,"Rich kids, like poor kids, can't choose the families into which they born. We can all, however, change how we feel about our own relationship to money. Ms. O'Neill explains these facts in a book that has much to say in a era in which the number of millionaires is increasing and those at the bottom of the economy increasingly hope to escape their circumstances by winning the lottery or a television game show. While personal stories and appeals to spirituality are not everyone's cup of tea, Ms. O'Neill's account of her own affluent upbringing and the role that spirituality can play in overcoming affluenza--truly a disease of the soul-- is compelling rather than cloying. This book is well worth reading by anyone seeking the full picture of how people relate to money."
1,Wrong title,This volume iv and not vi as listed. Its not a big deal but someone must have read the roman numerals backwards.
2,Your Mama Don't Dance To This,they put out one album too many. maybe they wanted to be pop stars. maybe they were just bored. something happened. they went way downhill with this one.
4,Nice album,"To me the best L&M albums were Full Sail and Motherlode. I just purchased Native Sons recently as I had never heard it. Don't ask me why because I don't know. So now, over 30 years since it came out I have heard it. It is not nearly as bad as some of the reviewers feel. With due respect to them I say this as we all have our own tastes. I like it and would recommend L&M fans buy it, but don't forget Full Sail, Motherlode, and their fairly recent and superb concert dvd and cd where they put on a great show in Santa Barbara."
5,A keeper!,"1999 Romantic Times Reviewers Choice Nominee! Frankfurt eBook Award Nominee! EPPIE 2000 Finalist!""FALLING STAR is a keeper for any bookshelf! I have to admit that I started this novel expecting to have a little trouble identifying with the heroine. She and I have nothing in common, and I thought that I might have to work at feeling involved in her story, but nothing was further from the truth. From the first page, I was interested and absorbed. I cared about the characters and I cried for them when their lives didn't go the way they should. I recommend this book to any lover of romance, and I won't hesitate to pick up the next Karen Wiesner book I find for sale.""~ Ivy Quill Reviews"
5,Wonderful Storytelling,"What a wonderful story. While this novel is similar to Jan Karon's Mitford novels, Annette Smith's storytelling reminds me more of a cross between Phillip Gulley and James Herriott (my personal favorite.) Small town life. Community. Neighbors helping one another through the ups and downs of life. I'm so glad there will be more of Ruby Prairie. I can't wait."
5,Great for Puppy Play!,"I used this whip as a flirt pole and tied a fuzzy dog toy to the end and had a blast playing with my puppy. This is a small size suited for a small dog or puppy as they won't have to run so far away from you. While my dog was having fun chasing the prey I worked with her on the drop it and leave it commands. For those days when you just don't feel like a 30 minute walk, you can spend 15 minutes working the flirt pole and your dog will be tired. I've also taken it on walks (with the toy attached!) to use it as a distraction when my dog saw another dog to redirect its attention. There are all kinds of training benefits from using this product as a flirt pole."
2,Poor Quality,"The car case is really cute and a great idea, but not well made. The latch broke off within days of receiving it. If you don't have the exact cars that are pictured, then they may not fit. The car spots are specially fit for the cars pictured. Save your money on this one!"
5,My son loves it!,"My son loves this case. Its made out of thick sturdy plastic and is nice and rugged. It doubles as a race track, but its kind of small for that."
3,ok holder,"It is nice that it has plenty of room for most of the cars from the movie, but the latches did not last long, maybe a month."
1,Don't waste your time,There's a reason why this book is out of print.It is missing huge key concepts and even defines words completely wrong.I was impressed with Penguin's Dictionary of Critical Theory so I thought I'd take the chance on this one.Save your time and money for a LaPlanche Dictionary of Psychoanalysis.
1,crap for christmas,"Gotta love Patrick Swayze...but come on, this is crap, even with the great Tim Curry too. Still crap and sorry I purchased it. Waste of movie funds."
3,Christmas wonderland,"This movie is very complicated, with weird happenings like money from above and the kids decide to spend it not find out who's it is. Anyway, Patrick Swayzie is still great actor but why he did this movie I don't know. I would probably get another movie for entertainment."
1,atrocious,"grabbed this one without thinking and watched for 25 minutes, which was 24 minutes too long. horrible writing and the attitudes of the teenage boys are really depressing. like a bad 80s b-movie."
3,Not bad,"This was not one of the best movies I have ever seen, but it was not that bad. I bought it because Patrick Swayze was in it. I will probably watch it again next Christmas. Very pleased with the delivery time."
1,Total poo-poo,"This movie was total poo-poo. There were 2 good things about it. 1) We only paid $1 to rent it from Redbox 2) it held the attention of our 2 and 7 year old boys while my husband and i shopped on amazon for Christmas gifts. If you want to watch a great Christmas movie with the family, I highly recommend ""A Christmas Story"", ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""The Polar Express"", or ""Miracle on 34th Street"""
4,kind of good,"I bought this movie because Amazon had this as one of their daily deals during Christmas for cheap. It was kind of cute. I didn't like that they had some actors act ""so"" stupid in it. I hate that! Being one of Patrick Swayze's last movies I took a chance and bought it without seeing it first. If I had watched it first, I wouldn't have bought it."
2,Christmas in Wonderland,This was a delightful movie. Some of the things the children did was a little far fetched but none the less a cute movie for Children to watch.
3,"Very average show, make sure you're doing something else while watching","Filled with some famous, though at this point B-list actors. It isn't a bad show, but feels like a low budget ""Home Alone"" based in the mall."
4,Christmas in Wonderland DVD,"This movie is cute and entertaining. It involves a brother and sister at the big mall in Edmonton, Canada. They find counterfeit money and spend some. The bad guys are after them to get the money back. It involves action and humor. At the end there's a big surprise for the family."
3,Christmas in Wonderland,"Reminded me of Jingle All the Way with Arnie. Okay if you're a kid at heart; myself, I'd like something a little bit more seriously dramatic. Patrik Swayze did the best he could with the script; he gets 4 stars."
4,Great read,"I reccomend this book to anyone who is interested in the subject of space travel. Mike Collins tells the story of his adventures in space really well, from his beginnings in Gemini and later on Apollo 11, he gives a great account of being part of the crew that made the first moon landing, a must read"
1,Were the Moon Landings Real?,I have many doubts about the Moon Landings being Real. Just too many questions. I honestly think it was FAKE.So many people have been sucked in by nasa. It was done in the Arizona Desert and a Studio.People can find out for themselves. Too many persons listen to nasa as if they are god.
4,The Only Thing Wrong With This CD Is That It Is Too Short!,"This is yet another CD that I previously owned on vinyl when it first came out. This is one of my favorites from him. This is long before he had achieved national recognition. Don't expect a set of country, or just love songs, or ballads. Perhaps, this CD shows off the versatility of Dan. The disk opens with Aspen/These Days. He uses strings on this song and it has a classical/rock feel to it. Comes and Goes is a wonderful, relaxing song and is one of my all-time favorite songs from him. The title track and Crow are okay songs. Next Time and Man In The Mirror/ Below The Surface are better. But, The Last Nail and Old Tennessee are superior. Perhaps, it's because my young, wife hails from TN and these songs both make me think of her everytime I listen to them. The only thing wrong with this CD is that it is too short!!! This is one of Dan's best!!!"
5,Another great oldie,"Great album - some of my favorites are Aspen/These Days, Comes and Goes, The Last Nail, Crow - which doesn't even cover the top hits from this album - Old Tennessee, Captured Angel..."
4,Classic Masterpiece by a Master Songwriter,"I owned this album when it first came out on LP and had probably played it 100 times over the years. Out of nostalgia I bought it last year on CD. It had been 15 years since I had heard it. Even though I had never really stopped being a ""Dan Fogelberg fan"", I just hadn't listened in a long time as other artists and interests captured my ears. The songs brought back so many great memories. Dan's crystal-clear angelic voice, acoustic guitars coupled with orchestral arrangements, and haunting songs make for a great album by a terrific songwriter. Along with ""The Innocent Age"" and ""Netherlands"" this is one of my favorite Fogelberg albums. Timeless!"
4,A Wonderful Surprise,"Prior to buying this album, I owned PHOENIX, INNOCENT AGE and GREATEST HITS. I was more familiar with Dan's later work and, gazing at the back of this CD, I didn't know any of these songs.What a pleasant surprise to discover that these songs are not only as good as Dan's later and more famous material, they might even be better. I wasn't sure if Dan would really sound ""young,"" probably because of his tendency to overproduce arrangements. But he truly does here...and this is amplified by the wonderful accentuation of country elements on this record.Tremendous guitar playing, soulful vocals, lyrics that actually have something to say...this is the sound of an artist truly coming into his own. And the songs are absolutely wonderful - a great mix of ballads and rockers, often within the same track!If you like Dan at all, make sure to get this one. You will not regret it, period."
2,Not Good,All of Fogelberg's Albums are very inconsistent and uneven but most contain at least a couple of good songs. This one is probably his worst and does not even have one memorable song or melody (OK - I guess Comes and Goes is the best song here and is pretty good). Amazing really how bad this is overall -- Avoid!!
1,Junk - buy an extension cord instead,"It looks good, but it is pure junk. The box is very light, and the design puts two rounded plastic tabs on the front, essentially little ice skates that the box wears so that it will slide around if you touch it even gently. For a device designed to sit on your desk so that you can plug a cord into it, this is a braindead design decision.The power cord on it is also painfully short.Buy an extension cord and duct tape the end to your desk. It will work better than this."
2,Not that efficient,"I thought I'd love this, and the power outlet is very useful, but the USB ports aren't that useful to me, because they don't allow for my iPhone to be charged while being plugged in. So I have to use my regular USB ports after all. What a waste."
5,Great Mix of Great Music,"This CD is increddible. It mixes together electronica with trance, with house, techno, and ambient music using a unique and dynamic bled of DJs, mixers, and musicians. A great buy. Won't find many more this well-created coming around soon."
5,This is great animation,"This is one of the best Dvd's I own. It's funny with somewhat a serious story with it. 3 adventures, a Warrior, a Thief, a Priestess and this dim-witted Magician. The latter adventurer being pretty much useless with his spells is always gettting abused by the others in the typical misshaps. The animation is really good and the the dialoge, though standard at times, is pretty funny. Definetly for muture audiances over 15 years old I would think. Go get this series I think it's great."
1,a case of Amazon being too big for its own britches?,"Buyer beware that you may not (and probably won't) get what you paid for. According to this product advertisement a cd is included, however none came with book. I emailed amazon concerning this problem and was informed that no effort would be made to remedy this situation (since it came from amazons warehouse) and If I was unhappy with purchase I would have to send it back. I'd say that is awful customer service which I hope isn't systemic with how amazon does it's business, certainly will give me pause when ordering anything from amazon directly and makes me think twice about renewing my prime membership. I'd say the book is ok, maybe a little outdated."
4,Great Product & Seller,"I ordered this book about 1 week before my online course started and I received it a few days before. Very fast to ship their product! It was in great condition. Well worth the money; I paid about 1/2 of what the campus bookstore sold it for. The only thing...It said it came with a CD-ROM, but I did not receive one. Luckily I did not need it for my course! Would definitely buy from again!"
5,Take a close look.,This bundle is specifically for Santa Monica College and should only be purchased by students attending this college. The extras will work with any class but the book will not. Please be aware of this. The product in whole is fine.
5,Excellent introduction to Horton Technique,"I'm a dance instructor and bought this video because I was interested in incorporating Horton concepts and exercises into my jazz warm-up.This is an excellent introduction to the Horton Technique, the video goes through the exercises of the Horton warm-up from a variety of angles then gives specific technical information on how the exercises are to be performed. The pacing is great. The video begins with a brief introduction to the history and philosophy of the technique and its founder and ends with a Horton Family Tree that lists all of the influential dancers and choreographers (Bella Lewitsky, Merce Cunningham, Alvin Ailey) who were trained in Horton technique and were able to use it in their varied styles.I recommend this video to anyone interested in a highly adaptable technique that emphasizes anatomically corrective movement and the expansion of the expressive capabilities of the body.I also recommend theDance Technique of Lester Horton"
3,Changes Needed,"The movements are excellent; however, they need to convert it into a 50 minute workout so that a student can mimic the performer. For this you need a different camera POV. The performer faces a mirror. You see the performer from behind and the side while also seeing the mirror reflection which shows the performer's front. All done on a 36"" x 78"" mat so the routine can be done in a small room - which is what most people will have. If they make these changes this will be a great, tough workout."
4,Dance Couples,"""Great Movie Dance Couples Paper Dolls"" is a lovely reminder of the magical musicals of old Hollywood. All of the famous gowns worn by the leading ladies are recreated by the artist's loving hand.For me, the renderings of the gowns worn by Ginger Rogers are especially beautiful. The ostrich feather gown from ""Top Hat"" and the Scottish outfits from ""The Barkleys of Broadway"", stand out.The second part of this work is less effective, probably because the costumes portrayed aren't as glamorous. I would have actually preferred it if Rogers and Astaire had been honoured by a book all to themselves."
5,They just do what they have to do,"Well theres no much to say, cables are great for its value, excellent quality and time will show how durable they are."
1,Does Not Last Long,"I bought this after looking at the great reviews it received. However, the quality was impaired after only a couple of months of usage (approx 2 or 3 times a week). The spectraflex cable was never stepped on, but after plugging and un-plugging this between my guitars and basses it would produce a ground hum with the slightest movement. This was not worth the price."
2,Poor sound,Poor sounding quality from my guitar which was a Gibson Les Paul. Won't buy from seller again I'll just head over to guitar center for a better brand
3,"OK, but nothing special","This is an ""OK"" instrument cable, but nothing truly special. For the discounted price that I paid on Amazon.com, it is worth purchasing, but there are many better cables available at what is shown as the ""list price""."
5,The Best,There is no need to pay any more for cables. These are the best. The connectors on these cables are unique and the cable part utilizes 20 gauge copper and like their name are very flexible....CAN'T GO WRONG HERE.........
4,No CD with Blu ray,"My only complaint is the Blu-ray version does not come with the audio CD like the DVD copy does AND it costs more. So unfortunately if you want the audio by itself for your music library you'll have to sacrifice Blu-ray video quality for DVD, which is probably just fine. I'm just bummed about paying more for less."
2,Audiophile Viewer,I love Lindsey and I have all his collections since 1985. Honestly he is purely Fleetwood Mac !His two individual albums employing those musicians who are just affecting his image and reputationand those hits in these two albums they played are mediocre due to their musical ability and talent.Most of the songs are either sounding with no punch on bass or drums and percussion were too weak.Lindsey should have arranged a better competent team to play with him. He must shine on again !
3,First impression,"Three stars. Mr. Buckingham's voice is not as good as his guitar virtuosity in this concert as a whole. One in particular: End Of Time, is the best song on the DVD. Here he puts it all together with his voice, the band, and his lyrics."
4,The Small Machine Packs a Big Punch,"For me, watching Lindsey Buckingham in concert is a sometimes hit or miss proposition (usually hit). This one definitely is a hit. I think the smaller venue was a great choice in showcasing his unique guitar style and his connection with the audience. I missed him in concert this time around, but this DVD does a good job of making up for that."
3,In the tradition of Haden & Hall!,"Gene Ess is an award winning guitarist from Japan. After discovering Jazz music in clubs around Okinawa, he moved to the states and studied the craft intently. His music style can be described as Avant Garde with influences from the likes of John Coltrane. It's a challenging style of Jazz that will satisfy purists and interest wannabes. ""Sandbox and Sanctum"" is his fourth release. I found his original compositions pretty good. The supporting quartet is outstanding. If you love music in the tradition of John Abercrombie or Pat Metheny's work with Charlie Haden and Jim Hall, this is for you! Good effort!"
2,Not so great at all,"I bought this book based on the tittilating title, but found it to be sorely lacking in both originality and excitement. This guy's really got to get over his (balding) self and find something new to do with his life. Maybe he could write for a boring little local newspaper or something. Don't bother."
5,"High, Wide, and Handsome","The Jonathan Ames that I most relate to is the man courtside at a woman's tennis match looking for flashes of panties under the short skirts. His columns, which filled what is now a gaping void in the NY Press, are collected here and they remind me of how much fun it was to read them every week. His persona is kaleidoscopic. He's the man in the trenchcoat and Fedora at the porn shop, the witty gentleman at the opera in a tweed coat and tie, Bernie Wooster with a prediliction for booze, drugs, and sexual depravity. It goes on and on. He's as brilliantly funny as Love and Death-era Woody Allen, S.J. Perelman, and Charles Bukowski. The book is a gem."
5,"BEST BOOK OF THIS YEAR, OR ANY YEAR","Ames writes with such honesty about the human condition it is amazing, and he does so with such humor I find myself laughing outloud, which can get me in trouble on subway when i read the book going home. But it's worth it, his writing is so real and true and honest. He really gets it. Definitely the best book of this year, or any year."
2,I expected something else,"This book is just a list of combined definitions from all sections in the MCAT. Although it does have some formulas well-organized in the back of the text, it's sort of worthless if you're looking for a cut-to-the-chase MCAT text. If you want an MCAT mini-dictionary, then this is your book. I thought it would be more of a breakdown of essential formulas and concepts, with examples of when use them, but it wasn't. My mistake I guess, but don't make the same one I did."
2,Just a dictionary,"This book is good if you get stuck on a particular word or concept, but it does not help you prepare for the MCAT. I'm not quite sure how I will use it yet!"
4,Cool,"I really find that this book of poetry is like an autobiography and after reading each poem, I yearn to know more about the author. This is a really good collection of poetry. It's sad, it's funny and even sometimes insulting, but in a good way. I love how he sometimes mocks society."
3,Great Album!,"I visited Dingle in Nov. 2005. I saw Eilis live in a pub down by the waterfront. I was hooked immeadiately by her voice and music. I purchased Time to Sail in the pub that night and listen to it all the time to be reminded of that wonderful trip.Her voice is equaling haunting and soothing at the same time. I have to say that she easily outmatches many other Irish singers I have heard in pubs around the country. But in my opinion she is better than pop crap like Enya because her songs are real and moving. Real nice CD. Go to Ireland, visit Dingle, see her sing, and buy it there."
4,One of the better incarnations,"The only version of Power Rangers that I accept camp in is the original. My favorite versions had some edge to them (Power Rangers In Space, Power Rangers Time Force, Power Rangers SPD) but this one is okay. While not really edgy, it certainly had more bite than the other more recent versions! Especially towards the end of the series!I would recommend this to die-hard PR fans or to young kids."
3,Ranger review no.1,"Too Disney-fied, campy, even compared to original. Edgier incarnations had better acting, less stereotyping. Let Bulk and Skull retire. PLEASE."
2,Nice Try,"I've been an avid Power Ranger fan since the day it first aired with ""The Day of the Dumpster"". I left the show around Disney's takeover and watched it sparingly throughout the years. After I heard of Saban returning to the series, I was happy and hopeful that the show would return to it's original self. Sadly, my hopes were not met. The show's cast is handsome and beautiful faces but, and I'm sorry for being blunt, can't act their way out of a paper bag. It's almost cringe worthy to watch them on screen. Specifically the Red and Blue Rangers (the two leaders). I'm hoping the next incarnation of the series that Saban produces is better than this series."
5,Great Supplement!,"There are some neat feats and build variations in this book. I also like the in depth description of dwarven culture. Oh, I'm sure the gnome and goliath are good too, I just haven't read them yet."
1,"Not a critical miss, but pretty close...","I accept that WotC is a business first and foremost, and that the bottom line is often the only line that's important, but at some point someone needs to step up and say enough is enough.If there were no Races of Faerun, I could perhaps see a reason for this book. Even then, I'd be annoyed by its narrow focus, pathethic handful of races and padded selection of feats and prestige classes. If ever there was a book who's sole reason for existing appeared to be to soak more money from a loyal audience, this - and the other core 'Races of...' books forthcoming - is most definitely it.Buy Races of Faerun instead and/or get a subscription to Dragon, but don't throw any money in this one's direction."
4,The Matrix examined by science fiction authors,"This is a very interesting book, with essays written by several science fiction and cyberpunk authors, like John Shirley, Bruce Sterling, Stephen Baxter and others. Some essays are great, others are so-so, but all in all, it is definetly worth its price."
4,"Little in size, Great the message","I had checked out several research methodology books to find out 'how' to keep fieldnotes. I had been looking for very 'practical' and 'down to earth' reference which can offer me the real examples and approaches of fieldsnotes. Although there were good research methodology books, I could hardly find the reference for 'fieldnotes'.The content of this practical and theoretical guide to fieldnotes is quite satisfactory and now I think I know how to keep my own fieldnotes. The text size, however, is so small that I got tired of reading it. On the whole, I am satisfied with this little booklet (small in size but big in quality) and I would love to recommend this book to those who are interested in writing qualitative research articles.Jimmy Lee, PhD Student, mmed, Florida State University"
3,"Good CD, overall.","""Toys in the attic"" is truly a great release, and worth every penny. Rock sound, and crazy vocals."
4,WALK THIS WAY,THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST AEROSMITH RELEASE EVER IN MY OPINION WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ROCKS AND PUMP.TOYS IN THE ATTIC IS ONE OF THEIR BETTER SONGS BUT FOR SOME REASON YOU NEVER SEEM TO SEE IT ON ANY OF THE COMPILATIONS THEY RELEASE.SWEET EMOTION AND WALK THIS WAY ARE STILL LIVE FAVORITES TO THIS DAY.A VERY GOOD ONE!
5,Toys In The Attic Rocks On CD,This album always was and still is Aerosmith's best. This CD is a must have for anyone who likes Aerosmith. They have never sounded beter.
5,One of the 3 Pillars,"Get Your Wings, Toys In The Attic and Rocks are the 3 pillars on which Aerosmith was founded. They are honky tonkin, melody-makin, hard, bad and blusey. The ""Sweet Emotion"" ""No More No More"" & ""Round & Round"" combo still gets me..the anticipation in those songs is killer. This band could have ended their run after Night in the Ruts, but they didn't, and say what you want it's not about their old stuff vs their new stuff, it's about continuing to do what you love."
5,"Tyler and company's best work, IMO","First released in 1975, this is Aerosmith's finest album although there are a lot of you that will not agree. It features the roots of the group which is a blues and hard rock blend. This was a period of hard playing and partying for the group and this rocker exhibits all of that and more becoming a classic rock 70s centerpiece for many. Play it often and play it loud. Remastered for better sound quality, it's well worth adding to your collection. Featuring the smash hits ""Walk This Way"" and ""Sweet Emotion""."
5,Great Rock n Roll,Withstands the passage of time. Brings back memories of College days. Much simpler times....Just great meaty rock and roll.
4,Toys in the Attic and Rocks are the only two albums you need,"""Toys in the Attic"" and ""Rocks"" are both 4 star albums. They are pure rock n roll at its greatest and raw form, with a classic feel. For simplicity, I have combined both reviews in this one review.There is not a bad song on either disc, although I would not call these albums masterpieces in the true sense of the word, hence four stars. I would argue it is the only albums of theirs that you need. Frankly, I would give all their other albums two stars, although I realize that might make a lot of people gasp. In my book, nothing else Aerosmith has done compares. Other earlier works are not as solid and later works sound like an entirely different band. Even the greatest hits albums fall short, to me.You want the greatest hits? It is a double disc set, sold in seperate parts - Part 1: ""Toys in the Attic"" Part 2: ""Rocks""."
3,record company is greedy,"This is a great work from the 1970s. The band was at their prime. The songs are all classic.A major problem is that upon re-issue on cd, there should be extras. The album is short and it is foolish to not put outtakes, extras etc. Lesser known artist get tons of stuff crammed onto their old recordings. This is not a sacred, Beatles recording that cannot be altered. A 25-30 minute cd is silly!"
3,"No more no more ""Walk This Way,"" please","I'll admit that this is a good album, but not one I normallychose when I decide to listen to Aerosmith. Sure it features manywell-known songs, but if I never hear ""Walk This Way"" again, I can't say that I'll miss it. The songs are good, sometimes great (""No More No More,"" ""Sweet Emotion,"" ""Uncle Salty,"" and ""Adam's Apple,"") but the cover song is lame albeit popular, and there is that Run DMC song on here as well... Buy it for ""No More No More"" if nothing else and know that ""You See Me Crying,"" while it is their first true ballad, is also the only good one. On second thought, buy ""Get Your Wings"" instead."
1,Music great - sound is crap,"I first bought this album on 8-track when it was originally released and that 8-track sounded better than this CD. I'm so dissapointed in the sound quality.Remember the first CD that you heard of a song that you were familiar with and you heard thngs that you never knew were there? This is just the opposite; the recording is so muddy that things you know are there are inaudible. I had to check my settings to make sure that the kids hadn't turned the treble and bass all the way down.This is no sizzle to the cymbals, no punch to the bass and no twang to the guitar. This CD sounds like it was mastered from an MP3 at the very lowest quality setting."
4,Rumpus Room,"Last week I was in The Boiler Room, a boy-dive in the East Village and this great song came on the juke box. I thought to myself, ""this band sounds just like Aerosmith."" It was Aerosmith, Toys In The Attic to be exact. It sounded so fresh, I was shocked to find out that it's over 25 years old. I ran out and bought the CD the next day. I love it all, and I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the annoying re-make of Big 10""."
5,Toys Revisited,"My feedback for the 5.1 channel SACD version of this classic is glowingly positive. The levels of discrete channel separation and effects do vary from song to song, and I wish the piano in some songs had been relegated to the rear channels, but having said that this album rocks harder than ever! Aerosmith's great song-writing and lyrics are clearly on display and the studio effort during the 5.1 mixing should be applauded. Sweet Emotion never sounded sweeter, nor Big Ten Inch more in your face; No More No More's beginning so crystal clear it sounds live and Round And Round - as you might expect - washes around the room in a dizzying display of the superior effects capable with 5.1 surround. Get this SACD before they're all gone; DVD Audio is already dead and unfortunately SACD may be a walking dead-man as well. Enjoy this superb SACD!"
4,A kickass album with only one flaw.,This album totally rules but has a flaw: No More No More. I'm sorry but this song just doesn't do that much for me. The rest of the songs are real cool like Uncle Salty and Sweet Emotion. Sometimes You See Me Crying stays in my head for weeks. One time I started jamming to Toys in the Attic during a test in Pre-Algebra and everyone looked at me like I was crazy! This album is real cool an deserves a lot of attention.
4,Keep up the rockin,"Toys in the Attic is actully one of my favorite Aerosmith albumsof all time. Like I said before, I would get this in addition toGet Your Wings, & Permanent Vacation. My favorites on this are2 of the bands biggest hits, Walk This Way & Sweet Emotion. Funheadbangers."
2,"Broken Case, No lyrics to read",The CD plays fine but the cd case came broken. No lyrics to the songs.Why Not?
1,Whoops,"Wanted Aerosmith represented in my collection, but I think the live album might have been a better bet. This one just gathers dust."
1,the worst album by the worst band ever,"I cant stand the band nor the album.There are bad lyrics, ugly, half dressed long-haired men inside. Not one of the songs is a little good. If you never bought an Aerosmith album before I reccomend you to never do that."
2,Thiz Disserves Minus Infinite 200000!!!!,"Aerossszzzmmmiittthh r just as bizzad as Van Gayf*glen (with DLG & SG). Luckily tey became better wit 9 Lives & the mizzasterpiece Just Push Plizzay. Avoid they 70s & 80s (...) at all cizosts though!!!!! I bet you'll hate it as well, dude!"
1,Leave these toys in the attic,I hate this band and everything they stand for. Areosmith is a band I despise immensely. They sould out YEARS AGO and they never remembered their roots. One star.
5,A GREAT PIECE OF WORK,AEROSMITH IS A GREAT BAND WHOM I LIKE IMMENSELY.This is a work of art which should be there in your collection.FIVE STARS.
4,Early Aerosmith,"This is when Aerosmith was still pretty young, but includes classic songs like ""Walk This Way"" and ""Sweet Emotion."" A very good album if you like early Aerosmith songs."
4,Aerosmith Rocks!,"This cd is great! It is an oldie but a goodie. My favorite song is ""Walk This Way."" It is a great song to rock out to. Its a fun and entertaining cd altogether. I definately reccommend it."
1,Poor Effort,"Kafura is a professor at VA Tech. and this book is a compilation of his notes teaching this course over the years. As others have stated, it is riddled with errors, some that could have been caught by a spell checker. I assume the only people who buy it are the poor students at VA Tech. (like me) who have no choice. The online quzzes are also a mess sometimes displaying questions from his C++ book or even the wrong answer.I found some of the writing to be OK but it really should be much better with less complicated examples. I can't imagine a sophmore in college having much success with this text. If you already have the basics of Java or OO down, then it may be plaltable. Remeber, professors are not really rewarded for being able to teach and this book is a classic example.Also, I noticed that many of the ""other books people bought who bought this book"" were also VA Tech required books (e.g., books by Larman, Christensen, and Daconta)."
1,oscar 1672,how can i review this item. the songs on the album are not listed. i have no idea what is on this album. that really sucks. who would buy an album without knowing what music is on it. i can't understand why the tracks were not listed for this album as they are for most other albums.
5,Perfect gift for dad or grandpa!,Show the special man in your life how much you love with them with this custom packaged fantastic fudge... Order yours today!
5,"So sweet, and wonderful to add to animal vocabulary","Many Spanish books teach how to say the NAME for the animal in Spanish - this one is so sweet, funny, and enjoyable, and adds to their vocabulary the SOUNDS the animals make. Again, another great board book to go along with Flip Flop Spanish. I'm tickled to have found this line, and will be using all of Boynton's Spanish Board books in my Preschool Spanish Classes.Sra. GoseAuthor of Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 1 & Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 2"
1,Expected more,I've never seen a book without a story...until I got this one. I could have grab a pet smart magazine and show them to my kids and told them muuu beee meow instead...my oldest (3) liked the pictures though.
2,Lost in Translation,"I bought this book for my 8-month old daughter, as I had seen the English version of this book and really enjoyed the rhymes. Spanish is my first language and I intend to raise my daughter bilingual, so I though this was a fun book to start introducing some words and animal sounds. Well, I must say that the Spanish version of this book is not nearly as entertaining as the English version. This book just doesn't rhyme at all! Why would three singing pigs say something so meaningless as ""Asi fue""?? Then you get three pigs saying ""oink"" day and night and a ""Ya est?"" phrase that was obvioulsy added to keep some rhyme, even though it doesn't make any sense at all. I'm dissapointed with this book and wish more time had been spent on properly translating it."
4,Muuuu,"Muy lindo :-) A mi bebe le encanta hacer los sonidos de los animales. Very nice :-) My baby loves to make the sounds and enjoys the illustrations. Really really like it, though the Spanish sentences at times don't really make sense, it's ok :-)"
3,........but i swear they are cool in concert!!!!!!!!!,"I promise! I saw them play with other bands like two months ago and they were pretty cool. This album is great and the only song i really like on it is ""Wiggerside"" but besides that......."
2,IS THIS VANDALS??,"Hmmmm why did this band change? when i say change, i mean, why did they change to be sloppier than ever and trying to sound like their ""heroes"" the vandals, their first album is way better than this CRAP!! buy it if have extra cash left over!"
2,Django is not on this CD,Deceptive CD label - Music is fine - but none of the songs are played by Django - the music is all from musicians imitating his play. While they are very good - I wanted Django.
1,"complicated, formal language","This phrase book suggests constructions that are not at all the way people speak in Turkey. Instead, it contains complicated phrases which are not only difficult to remember, but which are unfamiliar to Turkish people and hard for them to understand.For example, to get a bill in a restaurant you can say ""Hesap, lutfen"", which is ""bill, please"". Instead, this book has you saying: ""Hesabi alabilir miyim lutfen."".When I tried that, the waiter gave me a confused look, and I said ""hesap, lutfen"", after which he nodded and brought me the bill.Another example: the usual way to say ""where is"" is ""nerede"". If you want to be very formal, you could say ""nerededir"". This, of course, is the construction suggested by Berlitz -- the unusual, informal, unexpected construction.My recommendation: get another book."
3,Pretty good for Rexanne's first novel...,"...BUT...it was her first, so it's not exactly up to par with her later novels. Kind of slow, with a somewhat boring plot. It was worth reading, but was ultimately not a keeper."
5,Book,Have not read yet! I do like this author!! Will continue to look for her books. Thank you very much!
1,Awful! Please don't waste you time on this,"I had previously read ""Dangerous to Love"" by the same author which I had liked very much so I picked this up with high expectations. What a disappointment! It is impossible to feel any sympathy or liking for the hero - I know that Regency authors like their heroes to be cads and rakes that are reformed by the heroines - but this particular hero is not worthy of redemption! He is thoroughly superficial, overly concerned with the heroine's looks and just a nasty person! That made the heroine's behavior that much harder to understand. I stopped reading the book three-fourths of the way through because I was too disgusted! Please don't waste your money buying this book - there is much better stuff out there."
2,Don't buy this thinking you're getting the BEST of progressive rock,"While as the previous reviewer pointed out, this is a solid live performace. Greg Lake, Rick Wakeman, and Gentle Giant all appear on this set.The music, of course, is five stars, but the title in packaging isn't. I give this two stars because while this is great progressive rock from some of the premier names, you shouldn't get fooled into thinking it's the BEST of progressive rock.From what I've seen, there is no perfect prog rock compilation. But, I give this set SOME pointers: It's the best one I've seen.Buy it if you really love progressive rock like I do. It's not a bad CD; it's just not the best. Great music, wrong title."
5,Great work!,"I love the sounds and the tone of this album. Portions feel like a noisy big city street, portions sound romantic and troubled. I loved it on vinyl when I bought it all those years ago, and I still love it on MP3."
5,Beautiful Noise by Neil,"'Beautiful Noise is a quality recording, the songs are good, and the only problem I have is that there aren't more. I have been a Diamond fan for many years, and this CD is one of the albums that I have from the collection. I recommend it to all fans."
3,"Neil Diamond, Beautiful Noise","It was ok, not the greatest of what Neil Diamond has done.It didn't have the smoothness. It was too edgy for me."
5,"Jungle time,Rumble time,Tumble time","Beautiful Noise is Neil's very rockin' tribute to his hometown.While this album has some beautiful slow songs,it is the rockersthat I most enjoy.Songs like ""Jungletime"" and ""Street Life"" are almost-punk songs about NYC's nightlife.Neil's macho delivery matches the cool guitar riffs and the songs subject matters perfectly.The album has many diverse styles-""Stargazer"" sounds like it was written in the 1930's.""Dont Think Feel"" and ""Surviving the Life"" have a gospel sing-along flavor.""If You Know What I Mean"" and ""Signs"" very poetic and pretty.""Dry Your Eyes"" a powerful and timely rocker that deals with a nation healing from war.Yes,Robbie Robertson poduced it and took some heat for it.But it is Neil Diamond who is still a superstar almost 30 years later!"
2,NOT ORIGINAL GROUP,The original Platters were no longer singing together after 1970. After that time the group was most times performing under the name of The Buck Ram Platters. Not sure who is singing on these recordings.
5,Great Boots!,My husband bought these boots to use for hunting season in NW PA. We get alot of snow and can be really cold. His feet stayed dried and warm. He would tell everyone to get these boots. They are GREAT!
1,Cheap,The boots leaked when I stepped in an inch of water on opening day of deer hunting. Sent back for refund
4,Just what we needed!,"As always,I have difficulty finding the idea in my mind of what I want. This space saver hit the nail on the head. I am fairly hard to please since quality is sacrificed on so many things anymore, but this item fit the bill and is of acceptable value! The only issue we had was mounting it to the wall (didn't like the legs) but my clever husband mounted one of the brackets to the cabinet then screened it into the studs! I love it!!!"
5,Beautiful and sturdy,"This item totally surpassed my expectations. It looks more expensive than it is. Finish is great, size is perfect, glass cabinet is really pretty and doors hang perfectly.Note: I had our handyman receive and install it while I was on vacation, so I can't offer any comments on ease (or difficulty) of set up."
4,Read Them All (and liked them well enough to remember them fondly as an adult!),"I admit it's been a long time since I've read these books, but I devoured each one as a kid! There were 18 in the series at that point, maybe there are more now, maybe not.But I loved them as a girl, and the only thing I didn't really like was they tended to be a bit too ""preachy"" at times.However, if I loved them enough to read all 18, and then remember how much I loved them a good 15 years later...they must have been pretty good :)"
3,Dave Mason-era Traffic,"This record is nothing special. It sounds like Dave Mason-era Traffic--rough hewn, bluesy folk rock. What's all the hype about?"
1,Lame,"This album is mediocre. It may be better than other traditional-style rock being produced today, but that does not make it great. That guy shouting ""Blue Moon Rising""--God! How embarrassing!"
3,How to write a Gomez song,"This album seems like 10 variations on the same song. A lot of bluesy jangling that meanders along with some calm vocal accompaniment, then an energetic freak out with some gravelly shouting, then back again, over and over. It all hangs together, and it's not *bad*, but it doesn't really stand out. The melodies are capable, but nothing exceptional. The vocals sound like something from a Subway commercial. Again, competent, but so what? They do present you with a full sound, and a lot of details, but it's like they did it just so I could say that. None of the touches really accents anything.idk. I bought this disc because Amazon kept pushing it on me. I want to like it, but maybe it's just like a girl that's pretty and all, but doesn't click with me. It's just there, employing some musicians and entertaining those who do seem to like it.Amazon isn't always wrong, though. I loved The Shins."
3,Guilty,"I've been often accused of making bad comparisons, so, to keep my track record intact, I'll say that Gomez reminds me a bit of Blind Melon (and to me, that is a good thing -- I'm a big Melon fan). Trippy, weed-twinged southern-style jam rock. Right on brothers and sisters, right on."
2,Average musicians making average music,"I first heard the song Rosalita from a friend's mix CD and thought it was a decent little song. I gave the album a listen after reading all the rave reviews here. Maybe my expectations were just too high after reading all the praise, but I found this album unimpressive. The music is trite and uninteresting; not that it's bad, but it just lacks anything really that original. The lyrics are too heavy-handed and recycled at times. There are a few decent tunes on this album, but overall, it's average at best, IMO."
4,At a place between Beck and Blur,"If you want some points of reference on Gomez, think Beck (circa Mutations) and Blur (Blur and 13 era). These guys, like Beck, are trying to haul blues and folk into the 21st century. They also, similar to recent Blur efforts, aren't averse to taking some chances. More often than not, what they do works. And even when it doesn't, you have to give them credit for trying to push the boundaries. Liquid Skin ups Bring It On because the actual songs are stronger and, like any good craftsman, Gomez have learned from their mistakes the first time around. At a time where pop music is at its lowest creative ebb since the early 90s, Gomez are doing their part to lead us to greener pastures."
4,They're 'Getting Better' all the time,"Gomez have a very unique sound that isn't like any other in music today. Although they're a British band they sound nothing like you'd expect. Many people will recognize them from their cover of the Beatles' ""Getting Better"" on a television ad. Although some may look down upon this type of commercialism, hey, if it gets them noticed... This is a prototypical late night album that is a perfect soundtrack following a long day. Songs like ""Devil Will Ride"" and ""Hangover"" have that almost ragged sound that fits like an comfortable old pair of shoes, and ""We Haven't Turned Around"" is a ballad in the best sense of the word. Do yourself a favor and pick up this album. I doubt you'll be disappointed."
5,True Creativity,"While other bands are regurgitating the standard song format and 'catch-pop' tunes, Gomez is truly exploring the realms of musical possibilities. They do so in a way that you can listen to over and over, because we haven't quite heard something so original for so long. They are *awesome* live and a great band all around. Try 'Las Vegas Dealer' for starters. Please, do yourself a favor, spend the $$ and enjoy!"
4,Good followup but missing Bring It On moments of brilliance,"Moments of delight but somehow missing the quirky brilliance that peppered last years ""Bring It On"", there's no '78 Stone Wobble' to make you go ""What the...?"" and not want to listen to anything else for a while. Enjoy where much of the album is coming from though - ""We Haven't Turned Around"" assures you that their debut effort was not a fluke, and the UK single ""Rhythm & Blues Alibi"" like so many of the other tracks, will age well. Great to see live, and look forward to Irving Plaza tonight! Liquid Skin is not a disappointment but the lads have lost some of their debut's edge - best of luck for Album #3!!!"
2,There's a Reason it's so Cheap!,"Let me add a dose of reality to the reviews. This is a very low-budget production. The storyline is more predictable than most kid movies, and the CGI quality dates back to the early days of CGI. The graphics bears no resemblance to Pixar, Dreamworks, or Disney productions. See for yourself, watch the trailer at [...]While our 3-year old likes the movie (our 4-year old doesn't), and we have not warmed up to it after seeing it too many times to count. Usually, we can appreciate a movie after watching it numerous times (like ""Over the Hedge"" or ""Open Season""), but not so with Tugger. It's just not well written and the graphics are too dated to enjoy."
5,Tuggo! Tuggo!,"Tuggo is what my 22 month old calls Tugger. We also discovered it on Netflix instant streaming and it had everything this boy loves, trucks, planes, crashes and music. The first time he watched it and Tugger crashes he got real quiet, turned around and looked at my husband and I and sadly said, ""Tuggo Crash."" It was so cute. I finally came online to find a copy. Any little one who is into anything with wheels will like this movie. While I admit it isn't on my top favorites it is definitely one of his, and since it's a kids movie that's how it's supposed to be. I highly recommend this movie for any little boy. (or girl if she likes trucks, my daughter seems indifferent, but maybe it's bc she's only 10 months). If your kid likes CARS, then they would most likely like Tugger."
3,It was okay,"My 3 year old loves loves loves Jeeps. My older son wrote a Santa letter for him and asked for a Jeep movie of all things, so I found Tugger. It was okay. He watched it once and got distracted, and never asked for it again. I'm sure he will watch it again, but it is a little slow or maybe too long for a little one. It fit the bill for the Santa gift though."
2,hmmmm...,"I bought this after having heard a number of mixed reviews on this band - either praise or being called 100% bulls**t. i even saw them once and thought they were charming, had some nice stuff, but were overall a bit irritating. So i bought this CD and it is exactly what i thought it would be: a mixed bag. To say it is bad would be completely unfair - this band is very good and they write nice songs. But they don't really bring any excitement to the plate like some of thier contemporaries working in the same realm."
4,A worthy addition to any French music collection,"This compilation begins with ZouZou's music from the 1960s (tracks one through nine). ""Il est parti comme il etait venu"" is lovely enough to make up for the second half of this album, which is marred by 1980s production."
1,Low battery,"This battery is generic as they come. The battery casing is a solid green plastic with no markings whatsover on it. The battery even game in a lightly padded envelope. I was expecting better packing. The battery wasn't dead but tested low as it wasn't the full 7.2v it was supposed to be. It was approximately 4 volts. Basically, I'm out $5 and my laptop still needs me to program it every time I turn it on since it still has a bad cmos battery and can't hold the time."
1,Not for a Latitude C640 as listed,"As another reviewer indicated, this isn't the same type of battery that comes in the Dell Latitude C640 (my computer). This is a straight line of 6 cells, where the Dell battery is two rows of 3 cells. As a result, I was unable to use the battery. In trying to make it fit, I broke the battery, so I couldn't return it. My fault, so it's my loss. But I highly recommend you take a look at your current battery before ordering. There isn't much room inside a laptop. The same other reviewer said he got it to work, but I don't know how."
5,Solo Safe,"A Good common sense book. !! The Book gives information about the things a person needs to consider when going alone and covers it in enough detail to help make your outing safe.You can tell the recommendations are based on a lot of experience and common sense.I enjoyed this book very much and got a lot of pointers that will help . Also, I was impressed how fast the book was shipped(48 Hours) and received the book in less than a week after I ordered it. Highly Recommended."
5,Love it,"Very fast shipment! Well packaged. Strong and well built. Will be using it to hang all my dog leashes, dog sweaters, harnesses, and collars. Love it! Thank you!"
3,OK,"This movie has merit because it adds an interesting possibility to the story La historia oficial provides, but it is rather slow-moving, and the shower scene is silly."
2,A little disappointed,"I've watched this film twice and am still not impressed. The reviews that prompted my purchase promised way more than was delivered. Throughout the film there was an absence of tension and conflict. A subject that received so much press and impacted the lives of so many should have been treated as deserved. Had I seen this film and known nothing of the political struggles in South American countries I would have forgotten the whole thing with a big ""ho hum"". I chose foreign language as the tag because ""drama"" did not describe this work."
2,For an experienced historian,"Becoming Citizens was a good book about the plight of women in California. It is filled with great detail and a lot of well researched facts. However, it is not a book for a novice historian. Being a US History major, I found myself lost with the lack of explaination on the women's plight. It is a great book to use as a reference for a larger term paper or thesis, but not for the average reader."
4,Rest in peace,"Tommy was such an accomplished guitar player-so sad he checked out so early in life. This is one of those albums that you have to be a fan of his playing to fully understand. Listened to this album in my senior year of high school, still one of my favorites."
5,A 70'S CLASSIC,"Man, it's unfair that this man doesn't get more recognition for the work he did. He was without a doubt the most versatile guitarist of his time. He could play it all, and he did play it all. Psychodelic-blues with Zephyr, Rock n' Roll with the James Gang, Hard Rock with the Deep Purple machine, Jazz with Alphonse Mouzun,, Fusion with Jan Hammer and Billy Cobham, and that's only half of it. Now with that all said, it's a cryin' shame this man is hardly heard of or his name isn't ever mentioned when discussing rock's finest guitarists. This is a great ""lost"" 70's album filled with all the styles of music I mentioned above Tommy plays except hard rock. It's not really on this one, that would be Teaser(the 1st Bolin solo album), but this is Tommy's best one. Not a weak track to be found. Post Toastee, Shake the Devil, and Sweet Burgandy(it's so beautiful) are the clinchers. LONG LIVE TOMMY BOLIN!"
4,MOST UNDER RATED ROCK GUITARIST EVER,"why is bolin so utterly ignored by the rock historians? all he did was play the fastest, hottest, jazziest, most inventive, classiest rock guiter of his time. and he was the first (and perhaps only) rock guitarist to stand up to the likes of jazz fusionists like billy cobham and jan hammer and more than hold his own on Cobham's classic record ""Spectrum."" perhaps the only rock guitarist more advanced than bolin was hendrix.well here we are treated to bolin's more extensive rock and ballad side. the album has a nice mix of heaviver pieces such as shake the devil and post toastie as well as acoustic ballads like gypsy soul.any fan of sophisticated rock and/or top notch guitar soloists will love this record and ask themselves the same question i have: ""why is bolin so under-appreciated?"""
2,More martyrdom & hero-worship,"Geez, this is really a mediocre album and the over-enthuastic praise given by most of the reviewers in below, borders on the ridiculous.At least Teaser had some good jazz-like jams on it. The tunes on this one are nothing short of boring and dull vamps made in the studio by musicians going through the motions.I really wonder if all the praise being heaped here is more a result of excessive hero-worship and the fact that he died young, then it is solely with the playing on this and his other album. Once again, an early death brings more fame than being in life.I find this also to have been the case with Randy Rhodes as well. Both excellent guitarists, both died young, both are now martyred in 70s guitar-god circles. Call me jaded if you will, but that's how I see it."
3,Private Eyes is not nearly as good as Teaser,"Private Eyes was the first Tommy Bolin album i heard and i loved it. That is until i heard Teaser. Private Eyes is good, Teaser is awsome! If you an only get one Tommy Bolin CD get Teaser"
5,A Great Classic!! Columbia--Where Is the Remaster??,"Even after all these years, Bolin's second solo record still holds up as a strong exit statement of this guitar legend. But the question remains: When will Columbia Records release an updated remastered deluxe edition of this masterpiece? The 2008 version is just a repackage of the original 1990 version. With all the interest in Bolin's career still in demand, there is no excuse why Columbia / Legacy has not given this a proper remaster."
4,pretty proggy for petey!,"this originally came out on hooj in the UK, with all of these mixes being on the UK promo vinyl. pete goes for broke on his mixes, really nice. the sample ""voices"" is from an old house record from about 7 years ago. the pmt and fata morgana rmxs will suit the more true progressive fans out there (pete heller does housier things - usually! BTW - the artist of this single is FUNKY JUNCTION vs. KC FLIGHTT. ""voices"" is the name of the track."
2,"Sorry, I didn't like it","To be honest, I didn't read it all from cover to cover. Of that which I read, I found it was a lot of psycho babble and I always found myself asking ""How do you know that?"" They did include references, but I found myself questioning the basic logic. Also, I didn't find this book helpful in being a better mother, which is the reason I bought it in the first place."
5,Very Surprising,Bought this item for my brother-n-law for his birthaday and he loved it. The items came as a set and I was very surprised how cheap they were for the size. Awesome! Would definitely recommend doing business with this seller. Very fast on time delivery.
2,Famous Pianists,"Unfortunatelly R Smith is not a good Alkan interpreter,he's a bit cold and dry. If you listen to his playing of Etude N#12 in E major and compare it to Bernard Ringeissen's, the latter is much better.The Naxus cd: The Railway and other piano works is inexpensive and really good. Alkan's chamber music can also be found on Timpani label. Hamelin is definitelly the best Alkan interpreter, it would be great if he ever decided to record all Alkan's work, like Leslie Howard with Liszt. R Smith is famous but just like the mainstream media, which is often off, the most known pianists are not always the best!"
3,Very Useful History,"The history concerning the French Revolution and the discussion of the ongoing political and religious fissures after that moment are very helpful. This book was written at around the time of World War One, and the writer has a first-class grasp of history as it was unfolding at that time. I have my doubts (IMHO) about some of his Daniel-based timelines, but I think the historical analysis is fresh, and very relevant for today."
2,wolves bath rug,the rug is very thin does not stay in place on tile floors don't think it will wash very well disapointed
2,Discordant and Distracting,"I enjoyed the first book in this series but found Duty and Desire to be a bit tedious. Aidan tries to tell the hidden story of Darcys return to his sister and London society. The story takes a turn through religious conversion and then veers off into intrigue and susperstition. Suddenly, readers will find themselves trapped in a gothic novel, where mysterious characters and events take over the storyline and Darcy takes on the mantle of ""detective."" Not a bad thing if I was looking for a romance/mystery. However, this narrative is supposed to be Jane Austen, not Amanda Quick. I'd almost recommend skipping this book all together, but there are some characters that pop up in the final novel. Maybe read til the castle party and skip the rest?"
2,May not be worth your time,"I loved the first book in this series, An Assembly Such asThis, but the second, Duty and Desire, was not as enjoyable to me. To put it succintly, the first was delightful and the second really dark. Read it if you want an interesting story, but it doesn't seem connected to the P&P; story we have grown to love. Unless you like that gothic touch, I'd suggest skipping it. You won't miss any of the plot line. I look forward to the last of the series. I hope it is just as good as the first."
1,Such a Disappointment,"What a letdown. After the sheer rightness of her portrayal of Mr. Darcy in the first book, I couldn't believe how completely Pamela Aidan switched gears on us. I accept that she's not Jane Austen and that it must be very hard to come up with plausible ways to fill in the unknowns. But she wrote the first book with such believable, Austen-like spirit, if not her actual writing style, that I don't know where this dull, preachy sequel came from. Was she in a hurry? Was her publisher pushing her too hard? To start the series in one style and to continue in such a completely different vein...well, let's just say that $14 for a paperback is hard enough to pay without feeling like you've been defrauded after reading it."
2,The Battle Rages On,"Heh. Between the dutiful sycophants from Aidan's mailing list who were actively solicited to write positive reviews here, and the intolerant and unjust reviewers who simply can't push the doors to their minds open far enough to admit that this book actually does have some merit, these reviews are turning out to be more entertaining than the book itself. My two stars say all they need to say, so I'll stay out of the fray. Instead, I'd simply like to let those who have never heard of Pamela Aidan but are considering buying this book know that it would be better to start with the first book in the series called, ""An Assembly Such As This."" Both books are beautifully written forays into the mind of Mr. Darcy, and you're not likely to find a writer more capable or engaging than Ms. Aidan. So start with the first one, get acquainted with the author's perspective and style, and then delve into this more controversial volume. You'll be glad you did."
4,An Absorbing Read,"Surprisingly absorbing. This book corresponds to the slower, less eventful portion of ""Pride and Prejudice,"" and my expectations were pretty low. What a nice surprise. I can't wait for the rest."
3,Dazed and Confused,"What a strange reaction I had to this book. I was simultaneously delighted and appalled. After I finished it, there was a veritable marquee of conflicting thoughts running through my head, everything from ""what a splendid imagination the author must have to so realistically put me in Darcy's head"" to ""oh no, tell me she's not going to turn this into a holy-rollercoaster ride"" to ""how can I learn to write like that - I must learn to write like that"" to ""what just happened, did Phyllis A. Whitney somehow inhabit Pamela Aidan's pen?"" Very disorienting, it was. I guess all I can do is sit back and wait for the final book to clear up some of the confusion."
1,Simply Hysterical,And not because it was funny. I read the first book and was so excited I bought the next two. What a mistake. This book had me laughing at the absurdity of the storyline. What the heck? It's like the author wrote two different books about two different things and accidentally included them in the same series. I have never been so intolerably bored. I could not even finish the book because my eyes were to engaged rolling around in my head. In the end I skipped to the third book for the wedding.
3,A bit out there,"This one definitely goes a bit off Austen 's path, but still quite good. Many interesting characters in this novel."
4,"Duty and Desire: A Novel of Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman",This was a fun and insightful look into Darcy's mind for the first third of the Pride and Prejudice novel by Jane Austen.
4,Wonderful!,If you are an Austen fan - you will love this series. The author does a GREAT job of capturing Jane's voice. Enjoy!
4,"Not as good as book one, but have to read anyway.","It seems that most people agree that this is not as strong as the other two in the series. It is still a good book, but takes Darcy into situations that I did not believe. Austen is so great because she is so believable, and this just isn't. That said, this book does a great job of giving Darcy's valet a life. So many books just gloss over servants, and this does not. This book covers the missing months between Netherfield and Rossings. You have to read it because the situations are alluded to in book 3."
4,"Good, but not appropriate to Mr Darcy's story","While I wholly appreciated this book for the story in of its self, I was not a fan of how far away it strayed from the story of Mr Darcy and Miss Bennett. This really could have been completely taken out of the Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman series all together. It was more of a historical mystery novel than an addition to the story of Pride & Prejudice in my opinion. Marketing it as such would have been a better idea. The story itself was good, just not to the inclusion of an addition to Jane Austen's original work."
2,Not as good as the first...,After just finishing this book I have to say i am disappointed with the second book in this promising series. it is decent until the second half of the book which just feels untrue to jane austens story and is mostly a very outlandish filler plot line. i wish i had skipped it and moved onto the third book which i am still excited to read.
3,Duty & Desire,"I devoured this book....I couldn't put it down. I did miss Elizabeth's presence, BUT, this series is about about Darcy, not Elizabeth. Pamela Aidan seems to have truly captured Fitzwilliam Darcy. I don't read it and think, ""yea, right"" like I have done with other P&P ""sequels."" I am very anxiously awaiting book three, ""These Three Remain."""
2,Not on a par with the other two books of the trilogy,"I enjoyed the trilogy, but found the second book over the top. I felt she was trying too hard to make something exciting happen in Darcy's life. I didn't find it plausible that he would be so easily duped. The main reason to read it is to connect the first and second book."
1,An unnecessary filler book,"I bought all 3 books at the same time. I loved the first one, but hated this second one. I just couldn't get interested in it and so stopped reading after 3-4 chapters in order to start the third book, which I also loved.I think Ms.Aidan gave us two great books, for which I thank her. However, I feel she did her readers a big disservice with the second ""filler"" book. She would have done better to add a few chapters at the end of book one or the beginning of book three, providing us some BRIEF info about what Mr. Darcy was doing between meetings with Lizzie--after all the relationship between Mr. Darcy and Lizzie is what people love.And don't worry about things not making sense in book three without having read book two. The few references to prior things that I didn't know about didn't bother me at all--not nearly as much as trying to wade through the tedious second book. Save your time and money on ""Duty and Desire."""
2,What's the point?,"Skip this book, and just read first and third one. I get the author's intention - it's a Victorian Gothic novel, just with Darcy and some random women thrown in. I'm as much Jane Austen fanfick reader as the next girl, but I just couldn't get into ""Duty and Desire."""
3,"Three-and-a-half stars, actually","I wish I could give this book three-and-a-half stars, because three stars really doesn't do justice its overall quality. What's amazing to me is that I enjoyed it as much as I did, despite the fact that I have very little patience for ANY religion (yes, I am an atheist). Strangely enough, while I did find myself getting peeved at the direction this series seems to be going, I was still completely engaged in the story and completely convinced by the plausibility of Mr. Darcy's struggle. Pamela Aidan doesn't know it, but this is a great testament to her skill as a writer. I'm a hard sell, and she sold me. If only she'd ratcheted back the Christian slant just a tiny bit more, this would be a four-star review."
3,"First half was great, second half was NOT...","I actually read books 1 and 3 and then decided to come back and read this one. I found the first half of the book delightful regarding Darcy's interaction with his sister and cousins and how much he loves Pemberly. The second half I thought would be good because Darcy was looking for a woman to replace Elizabeth but it turned out to be a very weird mystery at some remote castle. I agree with the reviewer that said this was out of character for Darcy. He would have looked for a wife within the circles of Town. However, the book itself was very well written and researched. Not a waste of time to read it but don't have high expectations."
4,"duty & desire: a novel of fitzwilliam darcy, gentleman","This book has given me a better insight from William Darcy's perspective regarding the British Society, and his duties withing that society. Overall, it has given me a better appreciation of Jane Austen's book, ""Pride & Prejudice"" even more."
1,Not what I was expecting.,"It's been a long time since I've been so disappointed in a book. Maybe it was the expectations raised by the first one, I don't know. I even ended up caring a little less for Mr. Darcy, I was THAT disappointed. Considering my long-time crush on him, this is no small thing. I'm no literary critic, and I'm not even sure I can pinpoint what turned me off so much. All I know is that I hope the third book will be nothing like this one."
1,ONLY GOOD FOR THE FIRST FEW PAGES,"After having read the first one, which I thought was absolutely BRILLIANT, I was so dissapointed with this one. Being caught in this lame mystery is very out of place for Darcy. What made the first so great was seeing into his mind about all of the events in Pride and Prejudice that we know so well. The first pages of the second continues the great intrigue with his sister, Georgiana. However, I would recommend that readers simply close the book once he sets out to the castle. Not worth reading at all. I just want him at Lady catherines and bewitched by Elizabeth. Come on Pamela, do us proud!"
1,Pretty dull.,"Eh, I thought it was dull. Couldn't stand Darcy, couldn't stand what was made of his sister, couldn't stand the sensationalist mystery. No worries, though. Someone here is bound to tell me to ""deal with it"" or ""get over it."""
4,VERY GOOD CONTINUATION!,I like Ms. Aidan's concept of writing P&P from Darcy's viewpoint. Most authors choose to pick up where Ms. Austen left off. Ms. Aidan's approach is refreshing. I am ready to devour the third book.
3,Austen junkies -- must read this series!,"This second book in the trilogy waxes and wanes and completely deviates off course from the P&P plotline. The entire book starts with the Darcy and Bingley post-Hertfordshire time in London and ends with the meeting of Darcy and Elizabeth at Rosings. Feels a little like filler between the first and last of the series (great reads!), but a page turner nonetheless, introducing complexities to Darcy and many new characters. Read it just to get to book 3: ""these three remain."""
1,Save your money and don't buy this,"This was a bore from start to finish. And there was not a wit of Elizabeth from start to finish. Several reviewers have described it as ""filler"". I would call it ""tripe"". I don't know how this character was but he bears little resemblance to the Darcy we know and love."
1,hoping for better in book three,"I guess I'm one of the few who didn't like this book. Did Mr. Darcy really need an entire gothic storyline to make him realize that Elizabeth was a good person? Did Georgiana really need a conversion in order to get over having made a mistake? Maybe. But it just seemed like everything was taken to such extremes. Like the book was trying too hard to get its point across. Instead of feeling like I was reading a story about a man's internal struggles, I felt like I was being instructed. It left an unpleasant aftertaste that I hope the third book will dispel."
5,A most enjoyable read...,"This second volume of the Darcy series continues to explore Darcy's struggle with his feelings for Elizabeth Bennett. I especially enjoy the incredible details depicting the life of a gentleman of means during the Regency period. Ms. Aidan successfully creates a credible story that fills in Darcy's whereabouts and experiences during his period of absence in Pride and Prejudice. Although I already ""know"" how it all ends up, I am still patiently awaiting the third volume!"
2,Dissatisfied,"Gah, I paid too much for this book. It might have been worth it if it had lived up to the first one, but it didn't. With every well-written line, I was sure there was something just around the corner that would surprise and delight me. Nope, the corners brought nothing but more joyless text. Thank goodness for Darcy's valet, as he was the only thing that alleviated the boredom. Who knows, maybe the tedium was deliberate -- some attempt by the author to parallel the grayness of Darcy's world without Elizabeth. Whatever the case, it was, to me, a dissatisfying continuation."
2,"By All Means, Skip It","If you skip this second book and just wait for the third, you won't miss a thing. After all, what's the reason we're all reading this series? We're reading it for Aidan's delightful speculation into Mr. Darcy's character and his feelings for Elizabeth. Sadly, the very few snippets of feeling we're allowed to see boil down to ""Elizabeth is 'good'"" and are buried beneath so much contrived nonsense that it becomes a slog to get at them. If you simply must read it, keep your expectations low. Aidan doles out Darcy's feelings for Elizabeth with a miserly hand, and this book doesn't deliver nearly the emotional impact or excitement of the first one."
2,Jane Austen would never!,"If this book were billed as anything but ""in the style of Jane Austen,"" I wouldn't have had such a problem with its style. But, Jane Austen writing about sacrificial fetal pigs, faked deaths and Darcy and his valet working as amatuer slueths? I don't think so. It entirely lacks Austen's wit, and delves off the deep end in subject matter. The first book in this series, ""An Assembly Such as This,"" was much more like Austen's writing, except that it didn't have her sly humor. I'm hoping that the upcoming third book is better than ""Duty and Desire."""
2,Too 'gothic' for me,"I am not a big fan of the gothic novel which is probably why I didn't like this book. As far as gothic novels go, it was probably pretty good...it was weird and everything. But there were many things that Mr Darcy did or said that seemed too out of character to me. If you are reading this series simply to read Darcy's side of the P&P story then I think you could get away with not reading this book. Aidan does refer to some of the events and characters from this book in her third book but I don't think they are necessary for the continuing story in the third book, especially if you know the P&P story."
2,Skip This One,"Although it was interesting in some chapters, it is so far away from who Darcy really is. The Story was nothing about his romance with Elizabeth and was about bizarre happenings that were so unreal pertaining to the P and P storyline. Book one and Book three were very enjoyable and I highly recommend reading just those. They jump right into eachother. Book two is completely on its own."
2,Skip to the third book,"This book is filler nonsense. The only thing this book does adequately is explain the ""Duty and Desire"" title of the book. Darcy tries to make his duty to find a wife with money and rank to be the mistress of Pemberly override his desire for 'lesser' Elizabeth. This conundrum could have taken place in two chapters and spared us having to read this slow book about revenge and nonsense. Darcy would never have been caught in something so diabolical. I was also simply not in the mood for this book and storyline having recently read a similar nonsense P&P 'follow-up' called ""Pride and Prescience"" which was a silly, mystical mystery that I thought was stupid. This second in the trilogy could easily be skipped, as they aquaint you with what you missed in the third."
2,Very little to do with Pride and Prejudice,"It's not a badly written book and does serve the limited purpose of explaining how Darcy comes to grips with his love for Elizabeth. However, there's lots of prose dealing with Georgiana and her new beliefs and an odd story about a several days in the country with an old classmate of Darcy's and his looking for an eligible wife that continues for way too long. This could have been condensed into a couple of chapters and suited the purpose adequately. If you are reading the series for the Darcy/Elizabeth interactions you can skip vol. 2 and move straight to the third installment since none of the Bennets make any appearance in the book at all."
3,No Austen vibe in this one,"This one was good and definitely necessarily for the trilogy but if you are looking for the same Austen qualities as Pride and Prejudice, then this isn't going to be your favorite book. I enjoyed the parts that let us get to know some of the lesser known characters from Pride and Prejudice that are in Darcy's life much better."
2,A Missed Opportunity,"Pamela Aidan missed a great opportunity here. She had the chance to take us deeper into characters who are close to Darcy, like Bingley and Colonel Fitzwilliam, and she had a prime opportunity to display her wit with the London antics and ""attentions"" of the person who most wishes to be close to Darcy, Miss Bingley. Instead, we were introduced to an entirely new cast of characters. The only familiar character we learned more about was Georgianna. Too bad, really. If I can see myself picking up a book and reading it again, I consider it a good read. Since I can't see myself reading this one again, two stars."
3,"Come on, people","How in the world can anyone give this book only one star? That's like putting it on par with the millions of trashy bodice-rippers on display in airport bookstores. Ridiculous. Yes, there are some valid complaints, and no, I didn't personally enjoy it as much as I enjoyed the first one, but the writing talent shines through with every word. And the effort behind this book must have been tremendous. I appreciate an author who puts so much into a book, even if I don't always perfectly agree with the end result. Good grief, have we dumbed down so much that we no longer appreciate or reward good writing? I swear, we're going to end up with only Jackie Collins and Clive Cussler on our bookshelves. Kill. Me. Now."
2,So-So,"Well, I will definitely buy the third volume when it comes out. But that's solely based on my admiration for the gifted Ms. Aidan. I'm unwilling to give up on her, even though I reluctantly have to agree with many of the negative reviews here. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a very different sort of third volume...."
2,not as good as vols. 1 and 3,"This book is supposedly paying tribute to the gothic novel (like Northanger Abbey) and fleshing out Darcy's character, but it just comes off as too ridiculous."
2,I like the language but not the plot,"I suggest you read the 1st and the 2rd and skip this one, I really mean it. Its a very boring one about Darcy trying to look for a wife in a new made up place full of new made up characters while Elizabeth is no where to be found. Its completely boring."
3,Fun Read but not best of the three,"I loved all three of these books. However the second is not how I would have imagined Darcy spending those months before seeing Elizabeth again. I use this book now to read the first few chapters of the torchered heart Darcy had, at the sheer love of this woman who had captured his body and soul then once he leaves for the castle I go to the end of the book where he tosses out a keepsake and I weep for him. I love the final book best. Enjoy the book and reread the trilogy over and over."
3,second book,"I really enjoyed the first of this trilogy, but was disappointed with the middle of this one. I thought it was too dark and sinister to go along with the rest of the story. I am looking forward to the third book however, that promises to be back to form."
3,"A filler, though still entertaining","This book was Pamela Aidan's chance to develop Darcy's character entirely independent of Jane Austen's storyline. It begins with Darcy back in London just after the ball at Netherfield, and follows him up to right before he leaves for Aunt Catherine's. Essentially, this is the period of time in which Darcy tries unsuccessfully to forget about Elizabeth. However, I found myself kind of bored by the pseudo-drama that surrounds Darcy for the second half of this book and wishing that he'd finally run into Elizabeth again. I actually struggled with whether to just put this one down and start the third. Eventually, I kept at it, but skimmed through a bit. The parts with Georgiana are interesting, but the whole to-do with Lady Sylvanie is less so. Anyway, if you are planning to get the whole trilogy, I would still recommend reading the second book, as long as you have an idea ahead of time as to what you might expect."
2,Filler novel - not worth your time,"I read the first book of the series and really enjoyed it, and quickly read through it. I was actually excited to read this book after the first, but was sorely disappointed!! It was long, drawn out, and boring. Some of the story line was interesting, like the relationship with Darcy and his sister, and his constant affections for Elizabeth. Otherwise, I thought the story was a little rediculous. It kind of takes a mystery turn where Darcy sort of plays a detective, and that really turned me off. I still am excited to read the third novel, for that is the parallel to the heart of Pride and Prejudice. Even if you enjoyed the first novel I would not waste your money or time reading this one. If I were to do it over again, I would just read the first and third books. I don't think you would miss anything by not reading this book!!"
2,"Series should have been two parts, not three",I definetly agree with the other reviewers who stated that this book was ther weakest of the three. The plot was very much like a Regency Romance Novel that just happened to have Darcy in it. Elizabeth was mentioned sporadically and never seen. The first and third book in the series are good though.
2,Weakest of Aidan's Three,"Over half this book is wasted in a Northanger Abbey diversion which is totally off tone from P&P. Miss Aidan's instincts are good - have Darcy look for a woman to replace Elizabeth. But the method of doing it was all wrong for a P&P wannabe. Harmless? No, because the wasted pages were needed later in book three of this series to beef up a too short chapter six (Under Transgression Bowed) on how Darcy changes his personality to be worthy of his beloved Elizabeth, even though he is sure he will never see her again. Even so, read this book to bridge between the first and third installments. You won't be sorry, because if you're a P&P fan you'll really enjoy book three, my comment above notwithstanding."
3,A Strange Mixture,"What do you get when you cross Pride and Prejudice with Northgate Abbey and throw in a little Celtic mysticism? Well, something sort of likeDuty and Desire: A Novel of Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman (Fitzwilliam Darcy Gentleman)This is the second in a three part series and frankly, if you want to cut out some reading time, this section could just as easily be skipped. It really doesn't advance the overall story in any significant way. Many characters who are introduced are unnecessary. While they may figure a bit in the subsequent bookThese Three Remain: A Novel of Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman, they do not add to the resolution of the story.Having said that, if you are a fan of gothic romances you would probably enjoy this book more than I did. It was also fun to see other references of Jane Austen's work in this book.This is a fun series, just don't let this book turn you off from reading the other two volumes."
2,Not Necessary!,"I gave this book two stars only because it was written well. It was COMPLETELY irrelevant to the story, and I could have read the first and the last without really missing anything. Elizabeth is not even in it once! That is what I love about Pride and Predjudice, the interactions between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. Or even Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley, who also wasn't in the book very much. I did love the first and last installments though, and couldn't put them down."
2,You can skip this one,"The first book of the 3 books is a must read, but this one goes way out of the way of a regular story...feel free to skip."
3,"Entertaining, but less so than the first in the trilogy","While I throroughly enjoyed the first installment in the trilogy and eagerly await the third as a guilty pleasure, I was disappointed in the second novel. Aidan relies too heavily upon the fantastical settings and events to illustrate the characters' morals and mores, using it as a crutch. Darcy's impeccable morals and general disdain for the rest of the world is cemented, but the plot line does little to advance the reader's understanding of his appreciation for and fascination by Elizabeth other than ""at least she's better than..."" I frankly wonder at how Aidan plans to cover so much material, from Rosings to a wedding, in the third nove when there was no interaction with the Bennetts at all in this novel.I do appreciate the fuller illustration of Miss Darcy; Aidan creates a real person who was hurt and is struggling to not only to come to grips withevil in the world but within her own pampered existence."
2,Sophomore Curse,"The first book in this series was interesting and compelling. The second, alas, is ridiculous, silly, and something akin to a romance novel with its foolish, gothic mystery angle. Not even close to something Austen would have conceived. I'm waiting for the third, but not with great expectations. This book was lousy, plus the third was due in the winter of '05. It still isn't out, and we're well into the spring of '05. Major rewrites going on perhaps? Save yourself trouble and don't bother with this one."
3,A bit tedious,"Some chamber music seems like the composer is determined to try every possible mathematical combination of notes. This just drones on and on,unlike some of the other Koechlin music I've heard. I don't know his works very well, but I'd stay away from this one unless you are very into blah-de-blah-blah music."
5,Snowfall,"I really took the news of the loss of Phoebe Snow to heart today. I cannot think of another voice like hers.This album, and other tunes of hers I adore, were little moments in lost days I lived, that I find this remarkably beautiful to hear again. If you had to offer a tribute to her, you might just as well put this on, close your eyes and dance to the music.It's been years since these were penned but I don't find them dated, naive, or in some way lost to another time. I find them remarkably prescient. By far my favorite of her albums.Sad loss of a lovely singer songwriter and a mom that had uncompromising love for her child."
5,"I Miss You already, Phoebe! Need 10 stars to rate this!!!","Phoebe was taken from us recently. Was sad to hear this news. This album showcases her talents wonderfully. Her beautiful voice was so very unique, never duplicated. Even when she did commercials, you knew IMMEDIATELY it was Phoebe. I first heard this album in 1978, turned-on by a fellow Army buddy (Twiggs, that's you if you read this). Her lyrics are so mellow, yet complex. She covers substance abuse, dating a married man, other unpopular subjects, but presented in such a palletable context, it's all very musically digestible. Her voice, and the high quality of musicians who added thier various talents, make this album a MUST HAVE!!! R.I.P. Phoebe! I Hope Valerie Rose was in Heaven waiting to hug you! Thanks, Phoebe!!!"
1,dont get it,omg i hate it and the pads totally noticble i wold not get it but the regullar padds are good when you pin it to your bra or else it will ride up
2,Violent and stereotypical,"Forrest Carter's writing is exceptional, but I found the cowboy and Indian stereotypes trite and there was way too much blood and guts for my taste."
5,good writing,"Forrest tells a good story and his characters are fascinating. I like both this book and Clint's movie. There are a number of differences between them. The Vengeance Trail adds quite a bit to the characterization of ""The Outlaw Josey Wales."""
3,It's okay,"According to the person who read these stories, they preferred the Vengeance Trail more than Going to Texas. Both were good stories but Going to Texas didn't flow as well as the other."
5,Great Set,Great set of books. Exceeded my expectaions. Only had time to read one so far but looking forward to reading the other one.
4,RAO feedback,Pretty darn good. A good mix of history and fiction. Follows the movie well and leads into the next adventure. A good read if you like this genre.
5,Once I started reading this book I could not put it down,"This book capatured my attention from the first page you can feel yourself on the trail with Josey and his PEOPLE. I thought the movie was good but the book is much better. It gives you a look into Josey""s being and the resons he is the way he is. I can't wait to order and read another book by Mr. Carter. If you like westers you will love this book"
5,Josey Wales: Two Westerns,"I enjoyed this book immensely as I have been searching for it since I saw the Clint Eastwood film. The book and the film run quite a close parallel, but I enjoyed the additional story of the journey to Mexico to revenge Josey's friends brutally killed in the saloon. The characterization of Lone Watie is different in the book: he is a much stronger individual than as displayed in the movie. I found this book to be an excellent example of the western genre.Glenn Wheeldon"
5,Very pleased!,"Loved the movie, even loved the book more! Thank you! Have been searching for this book for a long time!"
5,Outlaw Josey Wales,Tis book is hillareous! A fun and entertaining book. If you like the movie you will the book. Plus more adventures of Josey.
4,Easy beautiful projects,The projects in this book are easy and beautiful.You can make for all seasons and be the talk of the town!
5,When Do We Get To Read Your Next Book,I found this enjoyable with a few twists and turns I didn't expect. What a suprise...Tonya keep on wirting and reading
5,Phenomenal,"There are not many opportunites in a lifetime to experience a novel like this. It is so poignantly written, you feel every emotion there is to feel. You laugh, you cry, you feel anger and happiness all at one time. You even find yourself referring to the characters by name. You must read this book!!! I invite you to experience both pain and perserverance with Jordan Baez. Feed your mind and elevate your soul, leave your wilderness!! I loved every chapter!!"
4,good combo of james and aussie crawl,"I was after a James Reyne best of CD but this is an excellent combination of his solo hits and ""Australian Crawl"" hits and the Company of Strangers track ""Sweet Love"".James Reyne, a very underrated Australian Artist.If you have not heard of James Reyne but you like Bruce Hornsby,Huey Lewis or Dan Hartman I believe you will Like James Reyne"
4,Another Australian Crawl Greatest Hits album,"One more of the so many Greatest Hits Australian Crawl albums. I guess that if you consider the Live albums, recopilations, hits and so on, they must have the highest ratio real albums-greatest hits albums in the history of music. This one is good, though."
4,Works great!,"This item works great, puts out plenty of light, I just wish you didn't have to use the remote. If you could give them power and they would come on with your last setting, that would be a great improvement! Overall though, I am very happy with these small, bright, energy efficient lights!"
4,"LabelPro3.0 - could be a ""5""",This is an excellent program for ease of use and versatility. The only problem I have encountered is that it is difficult to incorporate some graphics onto the labels. Business and personal applications are nearly limitless!
4,Almost Perfect!,"While this is one of Avery's most poplular products, and one of the best on the market, it falls short in one area. When you do a layout, you should be able to remove the grid, and have ""cross hairs"" to aid you in alignment. It's a small thing, and the average person may not require it. But especially for business cards, it needs a few more features. Everyday design though, makes this a top program full of artwork and is easy enough for even a novice to design with!"
3,Not complete,"It's nice if you're using Avery labels you just select the number. But, not all Avery labels are listed, and the size isn't listed in inches to choose from that."
3,Could be of use,"This book could be of use. If you are a teacher and have little creativity, this book can help you structure a course. However, it is of note that the book reflects a particular muslim region by the way the phrases are presented. Better than others, but not the best for me."
4,great content poor organization,"As I say with every TY book, they always have great content but poor organization. It is not that hard to order the concepts in a logical way so that it helps to faciliate the learning. PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE ORDER OF THESE BOOKS TY!!!!"
4,Great Album!,"Cash money did a great job on this mix. He used some great tracks on this one. However, some of the tracks seem a little too fast even though they're up tempo tracks already. Like Splack Pack's ""Let Me See You Work It"" track. It sounds great at its normal tempo, but when the bpm is increased it loses some of its edge."
3,Not what I expected,I was really wanting a book that would help me relearn French. This was not the book. It was laid out awkwardly and I didn't enjoy the process.
2,Not Very Good,"This book isn't very good. It's not very user friendly for a beginner. It's the usual workbook stuff; you know greetings, how to ask questions, numbers, common verbs and nouns, months and days, etc. Anyway, I've seen better ones out there - it's always hard to buy these things online without being able to view them, I recommend going to a bookstore like Barnes & Noble where I have bought a lot of my French workbooks, they have a very nice collection in the foreign language section. Anyway, the exercises in the book definitely isn't going to help you learn or better your French just on this book alone."
2,EASY FRENCH STEP-BY-STEP IS NOT SO EASY AT ALL!,"Come on, this in no way makes learning French easy. I might as well have bought the paperback version. It is simply a good summary of grammar. No one I know is only interested in just grammar. No pronunciation guide at all! No index to help find things! I find this simply an inferior product. A much better buy would be Lliving Language French (beginning, intermediate, advanced). By contrast Living Language does it right--pronunciation, grammar, games. For me, Easy French Step by step was a waste of my money."
2,Not enough instruction,"I bought this for homeschooling my son in French and it does not provide enough instruction. We were not able to use it. I expected it to be a basic book, but you need to know French to understand it."
3,"Good book, but answers filled in","I will be honest and admit that I haven't been able to dive head first into my new book but after starting Rosetta Stone, I can tell it is going to be useful to help me learn French. Unfortunately I have to remove the answers by hand because they were filled in by the previous owner. I know the book was used, but I think a lower quality rating should have been placed on the product."
5,Great,"A great book to get you started with French. Learn the vocabulary and grammar and then go for some reading practice, eg. withA B C Petits Contes (French Edition)andNouveaux Contes de Fées pour les Petits Enfants: Fairy Tales in French (French Edition)."
4,Absolutement!,I had looked for this version at our local book-seller and they did not carry the series. Such a shame because it is a great book for learning a second language and has fabulous resources for verbs and grammar.
5,Wow!!!,"Great book. I got the book from the library and have been using it for a college class. The book is very good and has actually casued me to rethink some of my ideas about non-christians. There are excellent stories in the book. It reminds me of how Jesus taught; in parables. I have never written a review here, but this book impressed me quite a bit."
4,Authentic...,"This is one of those books that you could read at any pace, but to really nudge out the details of the pages you really have to do alot of reflection. What i really like about the book was it opened up avenues for fresh questions and perspective. I found that by preasenting their concepts of ministry tried with real stories makes the book authentic. I love this. It gave a realistic vibe to it."
4,DVD & CD are appreciated and shared. Very good singing.,"I truly think that David is a messager, and I believe that he means every word he says. I am convinced that he conveys with conviction, and, for sure, his talent is truly exceptional. This,(I understand), is his first DVD on his own. The audio was not that good on the song, Gentle Savior. I have this piece on a previous work of his, which he sings so beautifully. Also, the cameraman could have done better with some of the shots of David's performance. Nonetheless, I thought -for the first publication of a DVD- it was outstanding, especially with it being contemporary Christian music, which is not usually my preference. Good job."
5,"Oh, my Stars!...10 Stars~Plus! An Extra-ordinary Talent!","Caught him in a special...bought the DVD..and..the CD, together...CD's in the car. Great music..no wonder they call him ""The Voice"". WoW!~I'd seen him sing with the Gaither's group where there's some super talent, too..and he's carved his own niche'...there and, now, on his own..There's not a bad song in the bunch...just better and better and better, all of 'em! He can sing some notes not heard, before, on this side of heaven. ~Just totally remarkable."
2,Phelps needs to rest,"First of all, I'm a huge phelps fan. Huge. He is an incredible talent both vocally and as a song writer. But, i'm concerned about his tour schedule and his more contemporary vocal style. It seems to be taking a toll on his instrument and he doesn't seem as strong as he was five years ago as a performer. He also seems awkward on stage in the dvd and not as seasoned as i would expect. Especially when he's talking. Many of the songs are live repeats of better previously recorded tracks. Get it if you must see phelps live, but I'd stick with his studio albums. Take care of your self Mr. Phelps...I want to be able to continue to enjoy your voice."
3,"Flimsy, but does what I need it to do","For the price and for what I need, it does the job, but I h ave to use a rod to hold it across the doorway. Fortunately, our dogs are trained well enough to know that this gate is telling them to stay out. As for it being a baby fence, I would not suggest it. It can be knocked over easily and I'm sure a baby would get his or her little fingers pinched in the accordion."
1,Worst Gate ever,"made poorly, not stable - would not recommend to anyone. Good if you are trying to keep a ghost out."
1,Waste of money,I bought 2 for my dogs and broke on the second day ... Waste of money! doesn't even deserve 1 star
1,"Flimsy, moldy, ridiculously delayed shipping",The gate couldn't be more poorly constructed. It doesn't stay opened and slowly creeps closed. The wood feels like it is made from balsa wood. The gate I received also had mold all over one side as if it had been packaged while wet. The shipping was also ridiculously late. After contacting the company by email and phone I have yet to hear back. Disappointing.**The company contacted me a couple months after this review. They were willing to refund 50% of the purchase price if I removed my review from Amazon. Apparently they realize that their company is lacking and are trying to buy off any unfavorable reviews.
2,Baby wooden fence,Right size and height for what I needed but very cheap construction. Would of paid more for better quality. Would be concern to use to protect baby from stairs.
2,Fell apart,"Sorry to say we did not have this gate 3 months and all the little nails sarted coming out. I did put it back together ( 30 minutes), but only because my daughter liked the versitility of it."
2,Baby Wooden Expanding Fence,"I was very disappointed with this gate. It is very flimsy. I bought it to keep the dogs from getting into another part of the house. IF they were to jump on the fence, it would break into a million pieces. I would NOT suggest buying this gate."
1,"DO NOT BUY --- DEPLORABLE QUALITY, SPLINTERS",I purchased two gates for to use as baby barriers. The quality is beyond incredibly bad. Rough cut trash wood full of splinters. A total waste of money.
2,Saucy,"Don't expect too much. The fence is very flimsy. If your expecting to use it for your children I do not recommend it. Extremely light weight. Easy to break, push over, and move. I cannot expand it to its extent with out it retracting by itself. Dosent really offer much 'protection' at all. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Wooden expanding gate.,"This gate is not worth using. It is not strong enough to stay in place under most conditions. Also, the points on top and bottom are sharp and dangerous."
1,Does not work,The item sold to me for a Dell Dimension 2400 series does not fit the memory slots that came with equipmente. So I lost the money invested in the chip.
4,"Good items, but instructions or marking would help","Well made, as with all Freud items I have, however it would help if they would mark size on cutters and other items. A list of spacer thicknesses would also be nice."
2,Can't do size I want,"I got this after reading about the lack of documentation and measured the heights of each cutter at 4, 5, 6 and 8/32's. Did up a chart in excel and found I can't do 1/2 or 5/8 slots. Not much call for the 5/8 but I do need 1/2. Emailed them and awaiting response before deciding whether or not to return it."
1,Waste of $3,"I read the reviews before renting this all 3 just so happened to be full of praises about this film, so I rented. Now I want my $3 back and I'm wondering if the other reviewers are actually actors from this film trying to hype this movie up.It slow as heck practically through the entire movie. Tons of walking round aimlessly, talking bout sex, having sex (they act like high schoolers instead of adults)and useless random talking about absolutely nothing. The actors say their lines like they are reading from a teleprompter. I can't even consider a movie's plot when the acting is this poor. Utter waste of time and $$, I could have put a gallon of gas in my car instead.I have 6 more days to view this movie, so I guess I'll use it to help put me to sleep."
4,A great story...,"This is a wonderful video, one i still remember from childhood; however, i don't think that it equals the original, Dot and the Red Kangaroo. If anyone knows where to find the first video, please email me! :) Dot and santa claus is full of music and entertainment for young children, and worth purchasing."
3,The Precursor,Battle of the Books: The Curriculum Debate in Americaby James Atlas is the better version of this book. This is the precursor to that work.
2,not a concert!!,"Being a fan of White Lion, I expected a concert according to the title. Not so. The main 2 songs are Wait and Radar Love and a lot of tour talk, which is informative about the band, but not what was expected. It only ran about 77 minutes. Was very disappointed that more songs from the band were not included. They could have made an awesome dvd with live coverage of one of their concerts."
4,Great for Younger Kids,"I bought this game for my son who was just a beginner on the Nintendo DS. He really loved this game because it was easy for him to understand and do, which made him feel successful. I recommend it for ""little gamers"", ages 4-5. My son is turning six, and he doesn't play with this game anymore because he says it is too easy and boring. I think it's because of the repetitive nature of the game. I have no complaints, as I got it for about $[...] in the Marketplace and that included shipping to Hawaii."
2,Boring Game.,"I found this game to be boring, you do the same thing over and over again, throw balls to explode the bombs. Very similar to Meteos which I also have and don't like."
5,FOE WHAT U WANT YOUR LIFE OR YOUR JEWLES!,OFF THE HOOK! I LOVE THESE GUYS! U WANT TO GET PUMPED UP FOR ANYTHING THEN THESE GUYS ARE FOR U! ANYONE WHO DID NOT GIVE THESE RAW STREET PLAYERS A 5 HAVE A MENTAL PROBLEM! I'M TALKING TO U ALEXISI! ANYONE WHO IS WONDERING WHY I'M WRITING IN BIG LETTERS THESE CD JUST GOT ME TO PUMPED UP! THESE SRTEET HUSZLERZ ARE THE S#!T
4,M.O.P. Drops a Classic,"After a couple attempts MOP has finally dropped the real deal. Warriors is sure to be an instant classic, and Lil Fame and Fizzy Womack make a name for themselves big time. Primo helps out laying down the best beats I've heard from him since his Gangstarr days. Definitely the illest track is ON The Front Line, where Primo puts down, in my mind, one of the best beats of all time, and MOP rip the track up. But theres more than just one. Ante Up, G Building, Old Timerz, On the Front Line, Nig-gotiate, Follow Instructions, Calm Down, Home Sweet Home, and Cold As Ice will all have your heads bangin. Pick this [CD] up now"
3,not bad,"This album isn't bad, however it was up for album of the year on the Source awards, and it definetly isn't that great. ""Nig-gotiate"" and ""Ante Up"" (of course) are really the only stand out tracks. It is somewhat annoying and it gets repetitive how they scream BROWNSVILLE!!!! after every verse but other then that, a solid effort from the Mash Out Posse."
5,"""ANTE UP""!!!","Again M.O.P. has blessed us with another banger. Buy this CD and feel the lyrics, there flow is so raw. Track 14 ""Home Sweet Home"" is one the illest songs to ever come out, this CD is not for the clubs or the radio it is for the streets. Switching over to Loud Records was an A-class move and hopefully they will get the props they so long deserved. If you consider yourself a fan of Hip-Hop than pick this up ASAP. Warning, this CD will bring the Warrior out of anyone who listens to it, that's how real it is......"
3,"How about a wee tone down on the hardcore, chaps!","Indeedy, I loved ""Ante Up"", next to ""Gangstas Paradise"" it has to be one my favoritest hip hop songs ever. But catch my drift fellow listeners!This album is to hardcore for you!... It is unfit for any ears, though the background noise is quite jolly!God save the Queen! At least that's what I screamed after listening to this monstrosity. Only because the beats were as dandy as a basket of fish and chips did I give this 3 stars!Super yucky! GO BLING BLING CHAP-O-ROONEYS!"
5,Warriorz...Come out and playayyy!!!,"Where to start? M.O.P. is def not for the faint of heart. Their raw and hardcore style is unrelenting the whole cd. Billy Danze & Lil Fame absolutely tear it up on this album. DJ Premier among others provide some top-notch beats here. You have probably heard ""Ante-Up"" and ""Cold as Ice,"" as they got some radio play back in the day. Other than those two songs, my two favorites are ""Welcome to Brownsville"" and ""Power."" I recently got a new copy of this since my old one was scratched and decided to review it. M.O.P. seems to bit a hit-or-miss with most people I know, although mostly hits. Don't hesitate to pick this up if you have heard M.O.P. and enjoy their unique style.Also if you like M.O.P. give Jedi Mind Tricks- Legacy of Blood album a try."
5,Hip Hop In The Purest Form!,"If you love hip hop, you will love this album. From start to finish this album keeps your attention. CUts like ""G Building"", ""Calm Down"" and ""Ante Up"" are vintage M.O.P. joints. M.O.P. is to hip hop what Limp Bizit is to rock. They bring the heat and make you get out your seat. Ya underdig dat? ""Welcome To Brownsville"" takes you on a journey through their hood. To make a long story short, buy this album."
4,Change of pace from standard WWII run and gun games,"This game is more in the genre of ""FAR CRY"" rather than the MOA games. Stealth, patience and situational awareness are the keys to this game. One must approach targets carefully and secretively to advance. In the higher difficulty levels, factors such as gravity and windage must be taken into account in order to achieve the ""one shot, one kill"" ratio. The backdrop is the burned out ruin of the once proud and beatiful Berlin, just days before the Nazi capitulation. It is a very eriery enviornment that adds greatly to the game's overall atmosphere.If you need a breather from mowing down hords of Nazi's in mass as with other WWII games, I highly recommend this game."
4,THis is a Fun game for Snippeees!!!,"Head shots, Long Range, Reality like,,,talks abt Wind, Posture, heart rate, Aiming, all thosee techniquees. if you are into fast ,12,3 combat shooting games,, this might be just the opposite of what u desire. i like this game overall its exciting Kepping my Blood pumping all the time..COOl stuff!!!"
1,Risky,"The game loaded well, needed to re-boot , no big deal, BUT it has a program protector , that destroys your computers drivers.So I did not complete the download process.Had I know about the game protection system, I would not have purchased the game."
1,I threw it in the garbage,"The absolute worst tactical game I have ever bought. so bad, in fact, I couldn't make myself give to someone else, I threw it the garbage."
4,Good First Person Shooting game,"Sniper Elite is a good FPS, but mainly for those tired of the usual scripted WW2 games. The graphics are average and you won't need too strong of a system to play, but be warned that the product does carry Star Force. There were a few glitches in the controls, but nothing too major. The gameplay is where this game is unique. Having played a lot of MoH and Call of Duty myself I made a lot of mistakes in this game at first, trying to shoot everything that moves. With this game you get a better sniping experience and that includes taking your time when moving around and not engaging the enemy unless you have to. I also enjoyed having gravity, wind, sniping position, and heart heart affect your shooting. You will also be rewarded with a great bullet camera close up when you make a difficult shot. The price of the game (around $10 for me) was well worth it. I would highly recommend it for those who like FPS games and have some patience to play it out."
5,Sniper Elite review,"If you like FPS games, you will probably enjoy this. It has a bit of a different feel to it but I really enjoy it. It is not as fast-paced as a standard FPS...you need to move in stealth and choose your shots wisely but that is what makes it fun."
3,okay,the graphics are a little testy but its OK for a shooter game to start with. would like to se Elite 2.
5,A true classic.,SE is just one of those timeless games which comes along every so often that is just in a class of its own. Still being activley played online after 5 yrs and STILL holding a large following. realistic and well thought out. a MUST HAVE for every war gaming/sniper gaming buff.
5,Best sniper game out there!,"I have played a number of similar games and this is certainly the best of its type. If you like slower moving games that require patience and skill, this is the game for you."
2,Disappointed,"Because I fell in love with Stella eau de parfum, I wanted more, more, more of the delicious fragrance so purchased the body cream, which smells a little funky and barely resembles Stella. Sometimes I like a body cream much better than the fragrance (e.g., Juicy Couture), but this just doesn't do it for me."
1,1990 version,"This cd has not been made in 2008 as described above, but in 1990. Five stars for music! Great jazz fusion guitarrist!"
5,Land of the Midnight Sun,"One day, about 35 years ago, I was walking through a mall and heard this music playing and I loved it and had to go find out what it was. The store was playing the first song ""The Wizard"" from the album ""Land of the Midnight Sun"" by Al Di Meola. I had to buy it. I no longer have a record player to play the album so needed to find a CD and here I am with it on my computer playing as I write this review. I didn't know before this what kind of music it was called and have come to enjoy jazz."
4,Good stuff!,"First heard of Al from this record being played by one of the DJs at the local FM album rock station back in late '70s (before corporate radio regimens that pigeon-holed what could or couldn't be played on the air). What a trip! Coming back to it 30 years later (!), it's a little dated in places, but Al's playing is still amazing to hear. Totally forgot about Jaco Pastorius making an appearance on the album, so that was cool."
4,"Raw, yet powerful.","The one thing that really stands out about this album is the rawness of Al that hasn't, in my opinion, been recaptured in later works. It was obvious that he had to prove himself, and he did. The mid 70's saw a need for this type of rawness in the Jazz field, and Al delivered the goods."
4,Please enter a title for your review,"This Luke Walker is a really talented songwriter. Yes this album is commercial and juvenile, basically the musical equivalent of an American Pie movie, so if you can't deal with that move on, but the songwriting skills are so there on this record. There are a few weak songs, but most of the time the riffs, melodies, and harmonies are a cut above most similar bands. The lyrics on the single Chemical are quite thought provoking, questioning the validity of romanticizing the feelings of attraction people have for each other. ""Love is a chemical, straight from your genitals, never is spiritual, never unconditional...Love is a beautiful way to face your day, but everybody's got it wrong"". Who'd have thought such a dumb band could come up with such insightful social commentary? If there is any justice these guys will be bigger than Good Charlotte and Simple Plan."
4,chemical rocks,"I first heard chemical and thought that the lyrics were really catchy. After listening to the rest of the album, the rest of the songe were the same. It is a pop-punk album. This is not an album for your little sibling though, with a lot of swearing. Other than that it is a good album with some really funny lyrics"
3,Movie Sound Track,"I bought this album looking for something new/different/and off the wall to play on my radio show, and it has it. It's kinda fun to listen to and the songs are good. For the money it's worth adding to your Dwight Yoakum music library, and will give you 9 Dwight songs that to my knowledge aren't on anything else. Just wish one of them had been a rock-a-billy number....The Mean Eyed CatRock-A-Billy ReviewKNON Radio 89.3Dallas, Texas"
3,always pushing the envelope,"Dwight Yoakam is always pushing to see how country he can sound without losing any of the quality. I like some of these tracks, but in all fairness, I think I should see the movie so I can get them in context."
3,NOT GOOD ENOUGH,"DWIGHT MADE JUST A BAD ALBUM THIS TIME AROUND IT SOUNDS LIKE HE SINGS OUT OF HIS NOSE. THE LYRICS ARE BAD . SOMEONE DID A BAD OF HELPING IN STUDIO.SONGS DON'T MESH RIGHT . VOCALS SOUND LIKE BEING IN A DRUM WITH BAD ACCOUSTICS. WHAT CAN I TELL YOU . I WOULD NOT HAVE MADE THIS CD IN MY STUDIO. I WOULD HAVE MADE A CD FROM THE FANS WHO KNOW MUSIC. LET FANS TELL YOU WHAT MUSIC TO RECORD. THEY BUY THE CDS, GIVE THEM THAT RIGHT TO TELL YOU HOW TO RECORD. LET THEM DECIDE GORDON"
1,In accurate for teaching and learning!,"There are too many errors in this book. I used it in my class for a couple of weeks and found many errors. Too many errors to continue using it to educate teachers. I would not recommend this book to anyone, especially if they are trying to learn from it."
4,THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX,"SICK is a very original novel, and Jay Bonansinga crafts some sympathetic and some vile characters. Our heroine, Sarah, is a stripper, who is experiencing mysterious headaches; she is diagnosed to have an inoperable brain tumor. Her friend, Dr. Henry Decker, tries to help her through this. However, one day the tumor mysteriously disappears, and it seems like Sara has ""healed herself?"". Meanwhile, a vicious serial killer is on the loose and somehow Sarah finds herself mysteriously involved. From this point on, a truly strange case of multiple personalities emerges, with some original twists from this crafty writer. There are some slow, redundant passages, but overall SICK is a very different and enjoyable read."
4,MTD Belt Success,"Before the snow, the blower would start up but during the snow, it would not budge. Turned out it was the belt yet there were no workable replacement belts at local stores. Found the correct one easily at this site, it arrived right away while there was still snow to blow, and the price was better than the local dealers. Soemtimes things go right."
1,no refunds!,I don't like the fact that we ordered a belt but was the wrong model# and they refused to refund my money or do an exchange for something not used and brand new and saleable.
4,Arrived Damaged,"Very nice and quiet pump. Arrived quickly, but with some minor damage to the end cover that covers the electrical connections. Contacted Hayward about replacement cover and even offered to purchase a replacement part to avoid any problems of assigning blame for the damage. It didn't matter to me if it was sloppy initial packageing, or rough handling by UPS, I was offering to pay myself for the damaged part. Hayward said no parts available!"
5,great service and price,"We needed a new pump for our pool to replace the old and broken one. I checked pool stores and other on line businesses & you have the best prices. Amazon came through and saved the day with a new pump. Your service was great and we received the new pump within in a few days and made my 8 grandchildren and me very happy!Thank you, Janet"
5,I got what I paid for,"This Hayward is absolutely a great product. Pricey, but worth every penny. I was somewhat suprized at the lack of packing material in the box when it arrived. Fortunetly it was not damaged."
5,Best price with delivery,"I was replacing a pump and this one was the best fit for our system. With Prime membership, next day delivery was only $4 more. It is quiet and seems to work well. The pump has easy access to the filter basket. The only issue is that installation of the electrical connection is not easy since the space for making the connections is tiny. And make sure the 120V/240 volt jumper is set properly before turning the power back on."
4,Great Pool Pump,The pump works great and was easy to hook up. It is a little bit louder than the previous Aqua Rite pool pump I had which is why i gave it a 4 and not 5 stars. It is still not a noisy pump.I would definately recommend this pump to anyone with an in ground pool.Hayward SP2610X15 Super Pump 1-1/2-Horsepower Max Rated Single Speed
2,A good pump but very noisy,"A good pump with good output, and easy to clean basket. However, this pump is very noisy. I can hear it running from inside my house and from the street, hundreds of feet from the pump. My neighbors are starting to complain, not good!"
3,It could last longer,"I have now purchased three of these beasts. Amazon is the best price, but I sure wish the pumps would last longer. I replaced the first after some 6 years of service because it began running very hot. The second ran for only a couple years. It complete seized while being idle for almost 20 months. I suspect some chlorinated water slipped past the seal and corroded the shaft. I also considered a motor only replacement, but with shipping and a new seal, the savings weren't enough for the couple hours needed to strip one of the pumps and replace the motor/seal."
1,Damage During Shipping,"Product is not secure in it's packaging. All the stress is on the mounting foot holding the motor off the mounting foot adapter. When the item is mishandled, you break off the mounting foot adapter.Tried two different times to get this pump. Both times the pump arrived damaged. Was told by Amazon that since the third one would have the same problem, they refunded my money.Gave up and bought one on Ebay. Came the next day without any damage and now runs like a charm. Amazon should find out what is wrong with their shipping department. It sure isn't the shipping company since the one from Ebay came the same way."
1,Hayward Super Pump SP2510X15,"When we built our inground pool in 1996 it was installed with a Jacuzzi pump. This pump did a great job but finally quit working in 2007. I ordered a Hayward pump as I could not get the Jacuzzi pumps any more. We installed a Hayward Superpump 1 1/2 HP #SP2510X15. It has just been over 3 years and we are now having problems with the pump. Sadly, I'm dissappointed that this pump only lasted 3 years. Called the manufacturer and they did not seem to care about their products. I believe we will be looking for a different manufacturer for our next pump."
5,Replacement,This was a replacement pump for one that broke. Perfect in every way...was an exact duplicate of the one that broke.
5,great product at great savings,"I ordered this pump as a direct replacement for my 15 year old pump, which finally failed due to bearing wear. That's a long life, considering it ran 24/7 during pool season. I expect the new pump to last as long. It dropped right in with no piping modifications whatsoever. I saved over 30% compared to local retail store prices by ordering through Amazon!"
3,good product but dented,"The hayward pump replaced an older one I was replacing which is about 9 years old. The only problem I have with the one purchased from AMAZON is that the rear removable plate which covers the electrical components was DENTED when I opened the box. The box appeared not to be damaged. I inspected the pump to determine whether there was any internal damage and found none but was not pleased that this so called new product had been outwardly damaged. Instead of returning the pump I decided to keep it and it has been running fine. Shouldn't somebody be checking these things over before they are shipped out?Additionally, I just purchased and received a new CL 220 Chlorinator from AMAZON and the box that it came in had been RE TAPED and looked damaged also. Luckily the Chlorinator was not damaged. But the box had been previously trashed and retaped for shipment."
3,Review,"This is a ridiculous process, and if amazon continues it I will no longer do business with amazon."
2,Cracked housing,"I bought this pump new for a swimming pool. The problem is that the housing cracked on me after the pump was dropped by accident from around 18"" above ground. The crack was all over the bottom section of the housing. I didn't notice the cracks until I tried running the pump. It would not suck water out of the pool and notice the leak underneath it. Took the pump out, located the cracks and glued it. Tried agin, this time it developed suction, but still leaked water from underneath.Now, I am trying to find a housing for this pump to replace the one that came with it. I will contact Hayward and see if they sell parts for it.Another thing was not clear during the electrical connection is how to use the jumper between the 110V or 220V.I am sad to say, that my pump purchase turned out to be a disaster and I am still without a functioning pump."
2,Does Not Last.,I bought and installed this pump two years ago after our other pump failed. It ran quiet and performed flawlessly until now. I guess with the hot summer we have had the bearings have failed as it is making a lot of noise. Since this pump only lasted two years I can only give it a (2) star rating. We are replacing it with a Intelliflow pump for energy efficiency and it has protection circuits to protect against over heating or loss of prime.
5,Hayward Super Pump,Excellent pump still running on the pump I installed in 2004.I bought this pump as a backup.Good price.I use all Hayward products & I have been very satisfied.
5,Hayward Super Pump SP2610X15,I received the Hayward Super Pump 4 days sooner than the projected delivery date. I installed the pump and it was an easier job than I thought. The pump works great and I can tell more water is being pumped than my other 1.5 horsepower pump I replaced. The filter basket is much easier to remove than the other one. The price for the pump at my local pool supply store was $200.00 more - so this was a great deal for a very good pump.
4,Swimming pool pump,"This swimming pool pump is working nicely! Although it isn't a direct physical replacement, PVC pipe modifications and ac wiring were simple. Amazon shipping was very fast!"
2,3rd in 6 years.. not a 30 yr investment.,We just got our current pump in 2010 and when we opened our pool this week and turned it on the inverter was locked up and the motor overheated. It might be a good pump when it is running but you need to plan or replacing it every two years.
1,Two failures in four years.,"The first one died after roughly two years. The second one died just now (18 months). This exact model cost me $314 in June of 2010. The first one, the pump impeller shattered which jammed, which burned out the electric motor. Not sure what the problem is with this one. It's been off since last summer and when I turned it on I was treated to a 220 volt fireworks display. Its not reliable and its not safe. The first one was purchased locally. The second one was purchased from Amazon."
5,An Absolute Masterpiece,"I am 25 y.o. this album was made before i was even born. But let me tell you, you will never hear another album like this in your life!. The vocals are beyond description. Sarah Dash's Soprano is out of this world. I've never heard another woman use high notes as soulfully and as powerful as her(except Ms. patti of course. Also this album probably showcases the best of Patti's vocals. Nona's writing is fanatastic, and she serves the sexiest vocals on ""man in a trench coat"". I must listen to the songs on this album about everyday. This album has made me cry, laugh, and dance! This is a must have album!. It is just so funky and tireless. Forget Destiny's Child, and The Supremes. This is Labelle!"
1,Do not buy this!,"This was the saddest excuse of a documentary video I have everseen. I worked and lived in the backwoods of Ghana for more than twoyears and have some idea of what I am talking about. The majority of this video is spent showing the viewer expensive homes and large office buildings, things that are not typical of Ghana by any means. The only person who would find this mildly interesting is the businessperson who is re-locating to Ghana for work and is worried about whether he/she will be able to get their hair professionally done or have an air conditioned house. I watched my copy once and then promptly threw it away."
2,Lego Dino Attach Urban Avenger vs. Raptor,"Seriously? This item is priced at $119.00. It's no larger than a $12.00 Lego set at a retail store. Unless I open the box and the Legos are made of precious metals, this is an absolute rip off. Chaulk one up for the commercialism of Christmas."
3,OK Birthday gift,I gave this to my grandson for his 9th Birthday. He is an expert Lego guy and had it put together in about 10 mins. so not as challenging for him as I hoped it would be.
4,Urban Avenger vs. Raptor,"This is a very good lego set. The dino is very durable and fun. TheUrban Avenger is fun, but the antenna sometimes falls off. Parts of the engine sometimes falls off, too. I really recommend you buy this toy!"
5,A great book for your foundation for success,A must read book for those who are looking for stepping stones to greatness
2,"Dated, dated, dated","--look for something newer, or at least Think and Grow Rich. This book was originally published in '71 but reads like a florid self-help book of the '50s. Extremely religious and heterosexist."
3,An OKAY product,I got this product for my 2 year old who loves to play with magnetic cutouts of animals. I wanted the dual usability one so we can use the surface for both velcro ones and magnetic ones. Unfortunately you have to turn the board to use the other side. And now I have it hanged on wall and we are using only the magnetic side as it is too much work to change/flip sides. The way they have shown in the product picture to me it seemed that the flannel and the magnetic board is on the same surface.Over all an okay product.
1,bad choice,"I purchased this book before leaving and studying Norwegian intensively for a year. Now that I am in Norway I need to use the book quite frequently, but find many faults with it. It seems to be much more tailored to the Norwegian than to the native English speaker. For instance, gender is left out of the dictionary though this is quite important to know. Also, many common words and phrases are not given. I would recommend that one try another dictionary."
2,Keep shopping,My Norwegian friend tells me the translations it uses are rather formal. Indeed for some words she says it borders on archaic. The lack of gender information and limited information on irregular verbs also really hurt this dictionary. But hey the cover's nice.
2,Outdated,"My foreign exchange student from Norway looked through this dictionary, shut it and said, ""This is old - if you spoke like a lot of this, people wouldn't understand you in Norway."" I would recommend looking for a different dictionary of Nynorsk."
4,Norwegian-English Dictionary,"A thick paperback filled with a great amount of information, words and translation. Bigger than pocket size that would be great in a backpack."
1,not a good blade if you have any serious work to do,"the design of the blade is not good AT ALL. the dust from the blade builds up and smokes. this is the second one tried, thinking maybe that the first one was a fluke but even grooving for simple t-mold edging proved too much for this blade."
5,A Delightful read!,"Nanny and the professor was a delightful read, just the kind of book you would want to curl up with at the end of a busy day. The writing was flawless and the characters in the book were well developed, people one could relate too.Cassie and Joshua's romance was endearing to read, they didn't always see eye to eye and that made for some witty sparring between the two of them.Cassie was resilient in the face of adversity, her character enforced the saying "" make lemonade off the lemons life throws at you"".If you are looking for entertaining feel good romance look no further than the Nanny and the Professor."
4,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this book. The characters were people you wanted to know more about and they were funny. Funny and romance is always good. Actually it may be my favorite combination! :)However, there was something about this book that left me wanting. Maybe because it was a bit boring and cliche!"
4,Nice ring but where's the proof it's real?,This is a nice ring. Small defect in the silver coming onto the stone but not worth returning. I was expecting to get something with the ring showing that it is a real garnet stone but I didn't. Being that this seller also sells created garnet.. I suppose it's just a matter of trust that you're getting what you pay for.
5,Spend the extra $5 for the GENUINE garnet ring,"I just received my ring and I love it. The garnet gemstone is of good quality and a generous size for the price. It sparkles, it is clear, and the color is a deep but intense blood-ish red. It's beautiful. This same company has a similar, but less expensive ring, but notice that the title does not include ""Genuine"" when describing the garnet. I suggest spending the extra few dollars to get a real gemstone. Other people have complained that the gemstone for the less expensive option is more orange than red, but let me reassure you that the genuine garnet is RED. In addition, the service was great. I received my ring sooner than expected!"
5,One Year Later.,I bought this ring for my daughter last year. I was looking for birthday gift ideas and noticed I did not write a review. My daughter loves this ring. She has worn it every day and there has not been any damage. Worth EVERY penny. I hope I find another excellent gift this year.
5,New discoveries of Jesus' life in India,This is a very detailed account of a journey by a famous Indian Swami into the hinterland of the Himalayas. He makes amazing finds recorded on ancient scrolls at a buddhist monastery about Jesus's life before and after the crucifixion. Great read!
5,suspense? here it is,I loved Shubin's 'The Captain'. His voice is strong and clear. A very good mystery thriller and worth the awards it got. An easy read with suspense that builds. A surprise ending. I suggest that you have time to read the whole book perhaps at one sitting. You may not be able to put the book down.
5,The outstanding seminal work from which rai music sprung.,"Raina Rai's early 1980s recording is to rai what Casablanca is to movies or Macbeth is to theatre -- groundbreaking and just as relevant today as when it was first released. The album was remarkably ahead of its time and shows almost no signs of being dated. The infectious grooves which combine the traditional North African rythms and music with other world influences (such as reggae) produce an album which is joyful and exciting to listen to. If you have the open ear and open mind to enjoy international music, you cannot go wrong with Hagda...."
3,Indian ingredients in american cuisine,"Neelam Batra has been made an attempt to substitute Indian ingredients in an american cuisine. A good book if you're trying to blend both.Photos would have been nice. But if you're looking for authentic Indian recipes, I suggest you look elsewhere."
3,"Complete, but sloppy","This is absolutely the standard introductory text to quantum information and quantum computation. Nielsen and Chuang certainly covered all the basis, and tried to give a self contained book including many reviews of related topics in the appendices. The main complain about the book is that some times it is sloppy, making hard to grasp the concepts. In some parts of the book there are even grammatical errors. My advice, get it, read it, but be very careful."
4,Complete and didactical,"It is a book for specialists. In order to fully appreciate the contents you should have a physics, maths or computation science diploma. It contains a good introduction on Quantum mechanics, but for people that have already assited an introductory course on the field. Concerning the main subject: quantum computation, this book is the most complete review of the field and also suitable for a course on QC."
3,Nice Design But....,"This design of this product is very nice. It's sleak and modern. The directions on putting the pedestal base together could be a little more concise. The sound is still a little tinny even with the base booster on. The electrical cord is a little too short for wall mounting unless you mount it directly above an outlet. The remote does not allow to select specific tracks on the CD; you can only forward to a track or pre-program your selections. For the price and reason why I purchased this product, it will serve it's purpose. But had I seen and heard this product first, I would have made another selection."
1,Where are the Great Danes!?,"I was very disappointed with this video! The monotone dialogue of Josh was okay... but talking about a Great Dane aging and showing the same little puppy just didn't hit home for me. Where are all the Great Danes!? When you talk about a fawn colored dane, show one! When you talk about all the things a dane can do... show it! Looking at the same little puppy trotting around is a poor example of such a fantastic species. ""Everything you need to know"" ... not quite.The training tips at the end were helpful, specific and valuable."
3,Close enough I suppose,"It wasn't exactly the baseball I saw on the website. I have another one for my older daughter and the ball is all pink, which is what I wanted. This one is only half pink and half white. It's a small issue I know but I wanted them to be the same and the picture led me to believe they would be. I was disappointed but I guess this one will be just as good...just look at the picture real close to ensure you're getting what you want."
2,Pretty but extremely malleable,"I loved these earrings but unfortunately they bend VERY easily and I will end up having to replace the hooks. However, considering the price I paid I guess that is to be expected."
5,Perfect in every way,"These earrings are lightweight, delicate, and really beautiful. In my opinion, they are PERFECT. On top of that, the price is really reasonable. Don't think for one minute that more expensive ankh earrings would be superior to these! I bought an extra pair to put in the safety deposit box in case I ever lose them."
3,Not your typical western,"Surprisingly, The Proposition turned out to be a good movie.... though pretty brutal at times with the nonsensical violence. I guess that is part of what made it a good movie, although,it is sometimes hard to watch because of it. It is a little slow moving here and there, so don't be expecting constant action. It is definitely worth watching if you like western type movies."
4,An Australian western that understands the genre,"The Bottom Line:All the best westerns are about the nature of order and justice and The Proposition, while set in the Australian outback rather than the old west, understands this completely and probes these themes well; a film of exceptional (albeit never gratuitous) violence but also one which generates many wonderfully quiet moments with Ray Winstone (good as ever) and his wife Emma Watson, this is quite a little movie.3/4"
3,A good one,"I bought this movie hoping to see an action western, well it's not but it's a very good drama and it left me with a very very good impression. I would recommend this one to my friends."
3,Good movie but don't believe all the hype,"Overall Good movie but from all the reviews I was expecting it to be more violent, I also thought the ending was predictable."
4,"A 'Dirty"" Western",This movie reeks of Australia in a different time. The actors were completely new to me and the two starring bearded brothers looked enough alike that I had trouble telling them apart for awhile. Once I figured out who was who I really enjoyed the plot although I continued to have trouble with the plots premise; that a close brother would kill another to gain his own freedom. This is a graphically violent movie with the harshness of the Australian Outback adding to the venue. These guys are more realistic than any American cowboy movie I've seen.
3,Needed a better title,"I really debated whether the film deserved 3 stars, but I settled on it. You've probably read some of the reviews already , so you know the storyline. The old Australian ouback with a justice seeking ""sheriff' and a couple of really bad brothers reeking havoc. Because the word proposition was uttered once , it still didnt seem to fit the movie for a title to me. A rougher word word would have worked better.That being said the film holds the adult viewers attention with a strange feel that is shockingly real. Intense, wicked, welldone acting all around. I realize the film was a bit ""artsy"" but some scenes were stretched out too long. The violence fit the occasions in a unique way and really was gruesome. The seperation from Hollywood was felt in every way. Not for the squeamish or those into quick action . Decent sound and picture quality."
4,A different type of Aussie Western,"Shot in the Aussie outback, and featuring a cast of Aborigine actors, this off-beat take on the Hollywood Western has its moments, even if you know the outcome can only be bloody. Actually, more than the outcome is bloody. The whole thing is dripping. Even so, you may enjoy the tick-tock plot here, with its many moments of stillness just before the savage action erupts yet again. The gist doesn't matter, though the ending makes no sense. Let's leave it at that. Watch if you will enjoy a modern Western made in the outback of Australia in 2005. The photography is quite nice throughout, though some of the acting is maybe a bit wanting."
2,IRSH CLAN GOES WILD IN OUTBACK,"This supposed ""western"" is set in Australia and involves an Irish clan being hunted down by the authorities for murder and mayham. Actually, it is a vehicle for propaganda on the ""wholesale slaughter"" of aborigines. You know, what the whites did to the Indians in America? Bad white people. Bad. Bad. There is not much of a plot in THE PROPOSITION: one brother is captured and another forced to hunt the third down. It is really rather boring and juvenile and the scenary is bleak unlike the stunning scenary in American westerns. The acting is okay but this is just another violent, humorless, dark and lifeless film. For a good Australian flick, see BREAKER MORANT, which has intelligence, drama, and a fine script, all lacking in THE PROPOSITION. I propose that you skip this one."
1,Insane movie,"I don't mind violence, but the director of this movie must have been insane at the time this movie was shot. It is incomprehensible. I cannot say one good thing about this trashy movie. The ""Blu-ray"" video quality was no better. The story (what story?) sucked as did the acting. Don't waste your money!"
1,Who Directed This Crap?,"The husband - This movie is dumb. Whoever wrote it was really bored and whoever decided to produce it was either smoking crack or really wanted to incinerate their dreams of making a business out of film making. Good job on crappin' up my evening. P.S. You suck at moviesThe wife - Wow. This was an epic failed attempt at artistic movie making. First off, the cheap western version of A Thin Red Line meets the gore of a Terentino flick was pathetic at best. I could have filmed all the plot of this movie in a 30 minute episode. The rest was dramatically boring and pretentious scenes of barren Australian landscapes and silhouettes of sulking cowboys that would've fared better in a Marlboro ad. Great job at disappointing me with your ""too cool for school"" independent film class project plot. Please stop making movies. Go work at a gas station."
1,Amazon download does not work,"After downloading the file, i have not been able to view the movie, it keeps ont trying to get a license, much simpler using movielink or vongo."
4,nasty,"In 1880s Australia, a lawman makes a deal with a bandit to bring his murderous brother to justice. Simple story about the brutality of frontier life has direction, cinematography and characters reminiscent of the best 60s spaghetti westerns such as ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (1969). Viewers may also enjoy the similar-styled ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"" (2005) and ""No Country for Old Men"" (2007)."
3,Trying to be Unforgiven,"I have no beef with the cast; they did a great job. And the setting can't be beat: lawless, savage Australian outback. However, I couldn't help feeling that somebody was trying to redo Unforgiven Aussie style and not quite making it. Too many scenes of unrelenting brutality don't help."
3,"A nicely shot mess, ultimately unredeemed","I was drawn to this movie for two reasons: 1) it was written by Nick Cave, whose musical output I greatly admire and 2) the presence of Guy Pearce, whose acting chops I respect.Well, Mr. Pearce does a great job acting and the film is well photographed. Nick Cave's writing (overwriting in some instances) however, fails to make this a satisfying experience. When it comes right down to it, there is not a sympathetic character in sight and no hope of redemption. None of these character's motivations seems clear or reasonably consistent. It all just seemed like pointless brutality. Life is hard and then you die in the Australian west ..."
2,Wanted to hit the stop button a few times...,"Maybe the other reviewers are paid to give high praise to this film?I watched it, I continually asked myself ""What is the point of this movie?"". There was an obvious plot, but it was hidden behind a dozen inconsequential tangents that were boring enough to push me into the kitchen to do dishes while I kept an eye on the movie. Needless to say, I don't feel as though I missed anything while I was bending over putting said dishes away, either."
2,Wake Me When It;s Over,"Some will no doubt claim this is a powerful and moving movie, but the pace is so slow one can pop popcorn and do the dishes and not miss much. The action, when it comes, is harsh, cruel and grisly, painting a bleak picture of the terrain of early Australian civilization, the race relations between whites and the aborigines, and the brutal underpinnings of what passed for society in a cruel and violent environment. The movie reminds us in a stark way that Australia began as a criminal colony."
2,Broke with no guarantee,"Though the corkscrew comes with a ""guarantee"" for craftsmanship, it turns out they don't honor it. We spent $150 on one of these corkscrews from a local wine merchant. After 4 years of normal in-home use (about 2 times/week), one day the corkscrew just broke off while opening a wine bottle. We contacted the merchant and it turns out they stopped carrying this brand for the same reason - customers were returning them broken and the company did not honor any ""guarantee""."
1,Freud Went to Sleep on this One,"If you are looking for a really handy substitute for a biscuit (aka plate) joiner, use a 5/32"" slot cutter, with an arbor and a depth adjustment bearing (7/8"" for #20 biscuit, 1 1/4"" for #0 biscuit, etc). (You need to slide the wood back and forth around 1/2"" to get the right width.) HOWEVER, DON'T EXPECT THIS ARBOR TO DO THE TRICK BECAUSE THE THREADED PORTION OF THE ARBOR IS NOT LONG ENOUGH TO HOLD A SLOT CUTTER AND A BEARING (unless you do not feel the need to put the nut on to hold them on). I have had good experience with other Freud products, so this was a bit of a surprise."
3,Mediocre,"Great for someone in junior high, high school or someone who is learning English as a second language. It would be better if the words were more difficult. The immature stories are hard to enjoy. Word Master is better."
4,Increasing My Knowledge,So far so good....Great product! I am not sure why we need to rate all the products plus type 15 words min.....
3,grammer and word smart,"I like the product but there is too much unnecessary talk. I think the subject matter can be presented in a very simple form. I didn't really care for the alien story without a belly button. It was really annoying and distracting.I would really like the Grammar CD to cover the Grammer rules and use of articles. As English is not my first language,I am dying to learn to express myself in English clearly. This CD has not helped me to the extent I needed."
5,Perfect if you are on your own or want to be,"Successful Independent Consulting is the best available source of written information and advice on independent consulting I have come across. I recommend it highly as both a reference tool and for in-depth reading. It is an unusually well organized, well exemplified, comprehensive, and concise. It is full of critical, savvy insights for prospective and new consultants as well as those in the business for many years: some tips I already knew and could recognize as critical to consulting, and some were new to me and are proving to be very helpful in my career. It also has substantial, high-quality appendixes of additional resources, and is a great value. If I were just starting out in consulting, I would build much of my career plan on this book, and I know I will be referring to it frequently in years to come."
3,"Okay, but....","This book is okay. But, I have used ""Strategic Organizational Change"" by Beitler as a reference guide in my work as an organizational change consultant. It is full of checklists, examples, etc. Beitler captures 25 years of experience in one book!"
4,Nice Cutting tool,I am using this tool to groove ipe' for a hidden fastening system. I have set grooves in nearly 1000 linear feet of borad and still cutting with the same tool with little to no difference in quality since the beginning.
3,Fun read about movie marketing,"Lightweight and superficial, but a fun book and easy read about the movie business and movie marketing -- not about the art of actually making movies. The authors focus on how the making of ""big"" or ""blockbuster"" movies are driven by pseudoscience and marketing forces, and on the relationships between the theater business and movie making and promotion."
2,Poor Proofreading mars a great read,As a fan of the series I was pleased to find it on the Kindle. However the typos literally begin at the first word of the first sentance - and continue non stop to the end. The constant stream of printing goofs distract from an excellent tale. I am disapointed that Amazon charges for such poorly done work.
3,Disappointing,"I have read all of Laura Rowlands books. I was disappointed with this one. In several of her books she has painted the wife, Reiko, as a martial arts master. In one of her novels Reiko is attacked by assassins and still manages to kill several before she is captured. In this novel a poor girl who is a murderer captures Reiko and threatens her with a knife however Reiko seems to have forgotten all of her karate skills. It does not follow the form of the other novels. Besides for that I enjoyed the novel as I have all of the others."
4,Just fine but not quite her best,"Ichiro and Reiko are back! Hirata-san copes with his injuries. And Hoshina-san seethes as ever. Yanigasawa is still in exile but his presence is everpresent.Others have dealt with the plot, so I shall not. It is as intricate and interwoven as ever, though a mite contrived in its conclusion. Also, as remarked by others, the language seems to have lost some of its Japanese-ness and some truly modern expressions and English verb constructions have crept in.But I ordered the hardcover as soon as I knew it was out; inhaled it whole on Friday night; and savored it whole again all day Sunday.You won't be dissapointed in this newest addition to the Sano series.Joe Dehais"
2,Revisionist History of Japan,"I got hooked on this series because I like history, but the stories are lightweight and tiresome after a while."
3,They Were Broken,My CD cases were broken when I recieved them. 11 out of a 50pk. I called the company and they had re-sent another pack free of charge for the damage. The packaging was alittle better than the first time they sent them but it could of been better in terms of how they ship them to you. Overall I managed to get 50+ cases that were in good condition out of the two packs I recieved.
2,"Nice Cases, 10% arrived broke","These are really nice cases, I use them to mail DVD's and CDs. However upon opening the package about 10% of the cases have broken hinges."
3,"Nice product, deceptive name","Just a quick note. These cases are NOT clear cases, any more than a standard CD case is clear. The front is obviously clear, as almost all CD cases are, but the back plate (with the mount for the disk) is black, again like most CD cases. My Memorex clear cases are completely transparent. If I hadn't had a time-sensitive job that I needed cases for, these would have been returned. They are, however, of pretty good quality and great value for the price - they just aren't clear!"
5,Jewel Cases,I make a lot of CDs for other people. These slim line cases work great for these projects and they take up less space than commercial CD cases.
4,have to pack better,had some with broken tabs but over all they were cool the broken ones aren't worth reporting
4,"Fragile, but gets the job done!","If you are looking to buy this product, chances are because of its relatively cheap pricing and that its a space-saver with its thin case. It gets the job done and the price is great but beware that because of this, it makes for a fragile case and the cover gets scratched pretty easily! You have been warned."
1,bad decision,I thought a dvd case is a dvd case but the plastic on this product is so thin and brittle that the little tags that hold the front and back together break off on half of the cases. Next time I'll spend the extra money and hopefully have better luck.
5,TDK 50-Pack Slim CD Cases,"As Jewel cases don't really need to do much more than hold your CDs and DVDs, if it works, it works. You would have to TRY to make them unusable and therefore bad. In that respect, these do the job. You gotta love the space they eliminate. I wish regular disc cases were this thin."
2,UNHAPPY,They came packaged 50 to a package. I had to discard 10 because of the tabs that hold the top in place being broken. They are very fragile and I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Megalomaniac twit in charge: it is all about Peary,"Having read Scott, Nansen, Shackleton and many others, I was really looking forward to an engaging and indeed fascinating read here. I was, to say the very least, quite disappointed. I left off reading this tale about half-way through, being extremely tired of yet another Peary heroic gracing his pages. Peary is, as many have chronicled, very very fond of himself and loves to tell every reader how he singlehandedly saved the Inuit race, taught them so much, saved their souls and so on. This self-aggrandized spirit leaps from almost every page and quickly becomes muddling and frustrating. There are many other much better tomes of Arctic and Antarctic explorations, and I have listed some of the authors above. I highly recommend them to you, but am patently unable to endorse the pompous and vain adventures of Mr. Peary. PK"
3,"Very nice, but....","The flat/flush back does not allow it to sit flush against the wall if the there is anything blocking it. It should have been reamed with edge, and then it would be perfect. The design is as picture, and the quality seems average. The cost is a little high, so I don't know that I would buy these again."
3,"Magisterial, fair, but not the best way","Make no mistake: Robbins knows his stuff, he's fair, correct, and surprisingly open-minded. However, this is a transcription of lectures, and the syntax is contorted. He interrupts the flow of every other sentence to insert some qualifier or oral footnote, and the effect can be maddening. This is too much to read for the depth of treatment you will actually get. If you do read it, you will get a pretty swell reading list, but the material is definitely weighted in favor of antiquarian literature and ancient disputes. I personally found it a pleasant read, because I like old books and economics, and I felt a certain affection for the grand old man, but unless you share these tastes, you're bound to be frustrated"
3,Transcription of Robbins lectures lack some depth,"The book is the transcription of the lectures Lionel Robbins gave in the London School of Economics during 1979 on the History of Economic Thought. The material covered goes from Plato to Fisher (very few developments from the 20th century are included). Since the book is verbatim transcripts of the lectures, there is not much depth here. Therefore, a conventional book by Robbins on the subject would have been preferred (that he knew the subject, there can be no questions of). Also, the coverage varies: there is ample stuff on Smith and the early mercantilists, but the material on Marx and Walras, for example, is frustratingly short. Still, for those starting in the subject, this is an OK read."
2,1 good song.,"If you like ""Changed"" and want to buy this CD because you think the rest of the CD will be the same kind of upbeat music, you will be very disappointed. The rest of the CD is extremely mellow. The song ""Awe"" almost makes you want to howl. This is my first experience with Phil Joel, I think if I was familiar with the Newsboys, maybe I would have known what to expect. I hate buying a CD because I heard 1 song that Rocks, then the rest of the cd is a JOKE! :O("
1,THESE ARE NOT THE REMASTERS THEY CLAIM TO BE,Dont be misled by the date of production or the fact these are Japanese mini sleeve whatever..They are the original sony special product issue from back in the 80's....The first go round.....I went and ordered the first 3 cd's in the Journey catalogue......I recieved these.....of which I already have.This is definately a case of misrepresentation...and somebody needs a big wake up call...I get really tired of sellers who list things wrong
5,MY FAVORITE JOURNEY ALBUM,"I found this album long before Journey hired Steve Perry and found commercial fame. I forget what year it was but Ive always loved this Journey ). Featuring a young Neil Shoun fresh from playing back up guitar with Santana and now showcasing his own skills and while not anything in the main stream of rock at the time this album stood on its own merit and style. Its a very different Journey during this period, and I would have loved to have heard them do something more between this one and the next release with Steve Perry on board at lead vocals. Maybe they wouldnt have went any where without Perry , but I can still remember being in a record store last year and the customer next to me stating that he would only buy a early Journey record prior to Steve Perry and with that being 30 something years plus since I bought it that says something."
4,Expedition To Pre-Perry Journey,"It is like jumping into completely different world. The difference between Journey until Next and after Infinity is not just a vocal change from Gregg Rolie to Steve Perry. The sound heard in Next is avant-garde vivid, mythic, dynamic rock we have probably never heard before. Rock music like no other. Spaceman is a most catchy song reminiscent of early Chicago rock. Here We Are after careful listening you will find that it serves somewhat prototype of later Journey hits such as Lights and Touching, Squeezing... if you just imagine that the arrangements are more upbeat. The opening riff of Next is really familiar for 80's Journey fans. I do not know if Journey fans that are used to Steve Perry vocal will like this one, but you will find it refreshing and invigorating in different manner after repeated listens."
4,The only Journey I can listen to,"I was recommended this recording by a fellow musician who insisted it wouldn't be anything like I imagined it. He was right! Steve Perry, who sounds like a victim of testicular rupture, has not yet joined Journey at this point, nor has Steve Smith (who's more than a pretty good drummer). Instead, the incredible Aynsley Dunbar lays down thunderous drums on this release, while Mr. Schon's guitar causes boils to form in your head. This is not a collection of corporate-hit rock songs like their later releases. This is a fantastic progressive-rock group playing complicated meters very well and a definite must-have for anyone interested in good musicianship. After listening to this, you'll wonder why they abandoned this approach in favor of the drek by which you identify this band today."
3,ROBERT SHAW'S EARLIEST,"INTERESTING SHOW FROM THE 50'S BRITISH ATTEMPT AT TV. THE ACTING WAS RATHER PHONY PRIRATING GESTURES, BUT SHAW WAS PRETTY CONVINCING AS WERE CERTAIN GUEST APPEARNACES BY FUTURES BRITISH NOTABLES. IT WAS TRAGIC THAT IT WAS A SHORT SERIES. INTRIGUING AND TYPICLE 50'S STYLE OF PHONY SETS,"
4,OK,"I NEVER SAW THIS SHOW GROWING UP, BUT THE PRICE WAS GREAT FOR THE WHOLE SERIES. IT IS CORNEY AND NOT EXACTLY PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN BUT THE MORE YOU WATCH IT, THE BETTER IT GETS. IF YOU CAN GET CHEAP IT WILL PASS THE TIME."
3,Incomplete Collection,"This is just a word of friendly warning. This collection apparently has 30 episodes of the series. There is another collection available for just about the same price that has all 39.The series itself is fun. I'm about halfway through and am really enjoying it. Each episode tells a self-contained story, but there are plot threads that carry over from episode to episode (the fort is in ruins in one episode, then they rebuild it in another, etc). There's a lot of fighting but no real bloodshed. Something that kids and adults can both enjoy."
3,For Die-hard Piratics,"If a campy black & white TV series from the 50's is what you're craving, this will satisfy your hunger. Featuring Robert Shaw before Man For All Seasons and Jaws, it's for pirate fanatics that can't get enough. Don't be tricked into buying the recently released 2 DVD set, you'll pay more for them than this Complete Series collection. Arrrr!"
3,The Buccaneers,"The videos are well produced - but - the stories are disappointing - memories are better. However, having said that ..... I do not regret buying the set and will watch them with a certain sadness."
4,Informative and Guide for further Research,Recent investigations in Circulating Fluidized Bed have been reported in systematically. This book also explains the advantages of high velocity fluidization in various fields of industries. It also gives the further path of research which should be conducted. All in all this book is very good tool for the researchers allover the world who are actively engaged in research in the field of CFB.
4,A compelling and informative introduction,"to a part of modern-day warfare that does not seem to get its proper consideration in light of the massive damage it can do, *Plague Wars* is a fine historical overview that does not get too bogged down in the textbook bio aspect of biological warfare, but rather concentrates on the more easily-appreciated facts of who (who has them, who is willing to use them) what (bio and chemical agents we're looking at), where (have they or could they be expected to be used) and how (what strategies, vectors, etc). I was impressed by the balanced tone of the book, which conveys the seriousness of the topic without tending toward sensationalism"
3,Campfire Stories of the Biological Kind.,I'm going to keep it short and to the point (just like the book). What was good abot the book is that it covered several topics throughout the history of 20th century Bio-warefare but what it didn't do is elaberate on many subjects. This Book was well written and an easy read but doesn't realy go as deeply as it could into some areas. Instead the book gives general overview which works for this book. This is a good starter-book for anyone with a curiosity in the area of bio-weapons but I would reccomend anyone with even limited knowledge to stay away (or just borrow it from the library) otherwise there are other volumes that go more in depth into specific topics. Overal though: a pretty good book just a bit on the short side.
5,Absolutely great book.,I've ready many books on BW and found this to be the best out there today. It is both informative and interesting. I must read for anyone even remotely interested in the topic.
5,"This was a replacement copy - it is so good, my colleagues stole it...","Great detail, and eye-opening in its' detail of the development of Bio-Warfare.Well worth reading, if this is your interest or is job-related."
4,Great Overview of the Area--Still Current,"Although the book was written in March 2001, before 9/11, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and the Anthrax Attacks of 2001, ""Plague Wars..."" remains a very good overview of the history and threats posed by bio warfare. Although the authors are journalists by trade, versus scientists, they have conducted thorough research and the book is very solid technically, and generally free of hype and drama.Particularly interesting are the sections that describe how the Free World's understanding of Soviet efforts in this area gradually became clearer with the collapse of the Soviet Union and various defectors from their programs.Highly recommended, especially for professionals in the CBRN defense or disaster planning profession."
2,wrong category,"I'm pretty sure this singer is Moroccan, not Algerian. Should not be listed in the Algerian category."
3,"Good, but nothing more!","After ""Dawn of victory"" (Rhapsody)my exptectations for Luca Turillis side project rose to enormest hights. But King of the Nordic Twilight is an avrage album. Its has some good songs but it alsow has many weak songs. The good songs - ""Legend of steel"", ""Ancient Forest of Elves"", ""Kings of the Nordic Twilight"" The bad songs - ""Black Dragon"", ""Lord of the Winter Snow"", ""Where Heroes Lie"", ""Warrior's Pride"" The music reminds of Rhapsody, but the singer is not as good. But one thing is incredibal on ""King of the..."", they have a female vocal from Iceland, and she has a voice that is damn GOOOD and the Tow songs with her is very original and exiting."
4,great if you can get past the cheese factor,"Luca Turilli says that he composes his music by writing it out on sheet music like the classical composers rather than experimenting with riffs like most modern musicians. Perhaps it would be better if he put more attention on the riffs, however, because sometimes this album gets bogged down in the symphonic parts. Note as well that the ""classical"" music appearing on this CD (as in Rhapsody) tends to be of a simpler, soundtrack-y sort. But there's no doubt that he pens some great songs, among them ""Black Dragon,"" ""The Ancient Forest of Elves,"" and ""Kings of the Nordic Twilight."" This is a fun album, if still a guilty pleasure."
2,Whining 80's sounding vocals and decent music,"Don't get this cd if you are looking for some nice traditional sounding music with a new edge. I am so glad I sampled some on Limewire first. The songs sound great until you get that whining cry baby in there yelling about things only 80's songs could accept. Tough lyrics for no reason just reminded me of what is now called arena rock. Its a shame because the music is pretty catchy with it's traditional feel, then it changes. If you aren't into songs like ""The Final Countdown"" for reasons other than it's novelty, don't grab this!"
4,Much better than Rhapsody,"It's hard to review a Luca Turilli record without mentioning Rhapsody at some point. Truthfully I've never understood the comparisons. Not only is Luca's side project better musically its significantly stronger in the vocal department. Luca's lead singer Olaf Hayer not only has a better voice than Rhapsody singer Fabio Lione but he also has better word annunciation and vocal control. It's been said that Lione has better range but his higher range generally sounds forced. All in all Luca Turilli is more focused on making good music where as Rhapsody tends to be the soundtrack for a Viking film. It is often said, by the way, that Princess Aurora is a weak song. Although it is somewhat out of place on the record musically it is very much on target with its subject matter and is a beautifully sung song."
5,Waiting for more,"King of the Nordic Twilight is an Nordic Odyssey in the form of an epic opera. The music has emotion and drama. My favorite piece was 'Warrior's Pride.' Along with the CD you receive the words that tell an enchanting story. The musician Luca Turilli is a member of Rhapsody, but has gone out on his own for this CD. He has done an excellent job. King of the Nordic Twilight was to be one of three CD's in a trilogy. I'm waiting for number two. Luca."
5,Amazing,"This is the side project of Rhapsody's guitarist Luca Turilli and is it ever amazing. In my opinion every song on this album rules. If you like rhapsody or Blind Guardian or any type of band like that,pick this up NOW."
1,Poor audio quality,"This CD has about the worst audio quality I've ever heard. The vocals are barely discernable. I recommend that you NOT buy this album. Too bad, too, because in its original form, it was a really good album."
5,A nice slice of Americana,"If you lived in Evergreen Colorado in the 70's I think you were required to own this album. It was one of those albums that everyone owned, everyone listened to. I purchased this album through Amazon on cd after having owned it on record, cassette, 8-track. When it arrived, I put it on and was in a time warp back to high school. Pickup trucks, warm beer, good times. There isn't a bad tune on this album. Start to finish, Charlie has the ability to paint a portrait of life in America through his songs that few artists can match. A very nice slice of Americana!"
4,Power Mix,"This is one fascinating Powerpuff soundtrack. It features themes of the many characters in the TV show - both heroes and villains.In fact, the mix is produced by James Venable, the guy that does the music on the TV show. (He did a really good job, too !) These songs are merely remixes of the show's music along with audio clips from the many episodes. Some are interesting to listen, while others might be fun to dance to. There are seventeen tracks in all including Ursula 1000's ""Super Secret City of Soundsville"" specially made for this CD. Trust me, this is a must have for any PPG fan."
5,A Must for PPG Fans!,This record is what PPG Fans have been waiting for. You get to hear your favorite characters' themes remixed into danceable tunes! Great for the car! Blossom and the Professor are my personal favorites. Hope you love it!
2,Can't see what's on it!,"Since you can't see the song selection,and wether they are the original songs by the original artist! Not even worth the penny-$2.98 shipping fees. To recieve another one of those GOT'CHa's."
3,History or Hysteria?,"I found much of this book fascinating, until the author got to the sections on D&D and Heavy Metal. At that point it became obvious to me that this was just hysteria masquerading as historical research. J. Giles and Rush are not heavy metal bands...nor are they satanic, and much of the mythology connected w/D&D has long since been debunked (though to be fair much of the debunking happened after the book was written 11 years ago). I also got tired of the only sources cited for some of this (mis)information being groups w/obvious ties to the right wing religious establishment. Overall though, not a bad way to while away a dull afternoon."
2,"Entertaining, but not redeeming","I read this book out of a sense of morbid curiousity. Frankly, I've had better times at the dentist. Mr. Raschke appears to sincerely believe the things he writes; that does not, however, make them true. I recommend ""Satanic Panic"" and ""The Satan Seller"" for a better-researched and more reliable description of the issue.For those who still believe in Mr. Raschke's version of history, I would remind them of the old Usenet saw: ""The plural of anecdote is not data."""
2,Sticky,The joy stick became sticky and would constantly veer to the left. It lasted less than a month for me.
1,Doesn't work at all,"Controller came fine, feels nice and looks alright. When I plugged it in though, it fired random button presses constantly, making it unuseable."
4,Works good!!,"Just got this controller this week, and so far it has worked very well with my N64 system. I got a whole different one than shown in the picture, but oh well! Overall a great controller!! 4/5!!"
2,Works in a pinch,"I bought this controller in a pinch after my kids broke my real Nintendo controller. Unless you just cannot afford a real Nintendo controller, or unless this is the only one available, you should give this a pass. It does not control nearly as well as the OEM controller. It feels cheap in the hands, and makes any game harder than normal. Only get one is you have no other choice."
2,Controlller with issues.,"I Bought this because it was new hoping for rock solid performance.It is ok, The analog joystick is a little loose but doesn't effect the gameplay at all. However The Start button and select button can get squished down and cause all shorts of havock till you flick it.I would recommend not getting this product at all unless you are deperate for a controller that is not been mucked up by some kids at some point with slimey hands."
5,Number One for Weight Loss!,"I've tried many diet products but none have worked as well for me as Retiva. I like the energy it gives me as well as the ""baggy clothes."" I'm buying smaller sizes now and loving it!I'm still receiving compliments on my weight loss."
5,Donna Leon: Newly discovered treasure,"While in the UK last year, I took the advice of a bookseller and discovered a fabulous mystery writer: Donna Leon, a best selling writer in the UK who is little published in the USA. Her mysteries are wonderfully plotted and her prose impecable! Venice, its people and traditions come vividly alive, adding to the books' appeal. This audio is a prime example of the author's mastery of her craft. My only question: why hasn't she been more widely published in the United States?"
2,Why spoil the good story by arrogant bigotry?,"This is basically as good a Donna Leon book as any and well worth reading, but I'm surprised so few readers complain about the arrogant anti-catholic bigotry that keeps popping up (apart from this book another example isThe Girl of His Dreams). I'm not a catholic or a religious person otherwise, but I find this pretty disgusting. She must have a very deep-seated grudge. Try substituting catholics for Jews, black people, feminists or gays: I'm sure most would (rightly) think such prejudices and generalisations very stupid. She wouldn't dare to abuse the Islamic faith this way, would she? No wonder the books haven't been translated into Italian."
1,Disappointed,"This book did not please me. It is a poor example of the murder mystery genre. While the story was well set up, and unfolded in an interesting way, the ending was all botched. The ""mystery"" of several deaths was not solved, and the killer had no rational motive."
5,Satisfied customer,I received my order promptly and in great condition. I love the concept of the movie star shower curtain. The color was actually more brown than I thought but that was a plus for me. I love it more than I thought I would.
4,Great shower curtain,I bought this for my son's college apartment. Perfect for a movie buff and it really added some pazzazz to a dreary old bathroom. I'll probably have to get another when this wears out!
4,My Favorite Weather Report,"This is my favorite Weather Report album with Jaco Pastorius. My favorite parts are the improvisatory solos, where everyone really gets an opportunity to jam out. You can sense the interactive dynamic happening between band members.Heavy Weather used to be my favorite, but since I have been in the jazz scene for a while now I appreciate improvisation more than I once did. I&#65533;d say the actual tunes on Heavy Weather are better overall, but the soloing on Black Market overshadows that on Heavy Weater. The beginning of the first tune on Black Market is a bit lame, with the repeating &#65533;Do La Sol&#65533; bassline motif. You&#65533;d have thought Jaco could have made that more interesting. Other than a weak first few measures, though, I really liked this album all the way through."
5,Where it all started...,"After picking up Mat Kearney's commercial debut album, I did some research and found out about this album and had to pick it up. Much like his more recent/popular music, this album is filled with inspirational and deeply personal lyrics that any listener will be able to relate to on any given day. Mat has a gift for pouring his life into lyrics in a way that speaks to the masses. His unique rap/singing delivery is what truly sets him apart from other artists. Even today's commercial rappers can't touch Mat's voice, delivery, and lyrics. Many of the songs on Nothing Left To Lose are on this album but it's a must-have album for anyone who is a Mat Kearney fan. Fans of free thinking, positive artists will also dig this album. Don't miss out!"
5,One of the most original and best albums in the last 10 years,"This album is without any doubt one of the most original CDs I have ever heard. The success in which Kearney mixes musical styles is astounding. What makes this album so enjoyable besides the catchy melodies, good lyrics and his voice is the top notch production given to each of the tracks. There is so much here that one most listen to the album a good 3 or 4 times before you start to truly appreciate the depth of this work."
3,"Good, but not great","I bought this album because I liked the style of music from the couple of songs I had heard. Once I got the album, however, I discovered there were only 3 or 4 good songs. A couple of the songs are downright boring. So, while a couple of the songs have reached my favorites list, I never listen to the whole album anymore."
5,refreshingly good!,"Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, so is Mat Kearney's ""Bullet"" emerging from a sea of so many unremarkable new acts/new music. In a time where so much of the newest music is homogenized and lacking in edge, ""Bullet"" successfully marries hip-hop to acoustic. When you listen you will not only be blown away by the uniqueness of his sound, but the powerful messages. Mat is breaking the mold. He sings, raps, plays and writes. May he have phenomenal success and be greatly rewarded for choosing to take risks and be honest with his music."
5,Wonderful gem of a film,"This is a delightful movie, starring Billy Zane (""Titanic"") and Barry Morse (""The Fugitive"" and ""Space: 1999""). In the vein of the classic ""It's A Wonderful Life"", it's a warm, wonderful gem of a film that's both humorous and dramatic. Highly recommended!"
3,Corny but Cute,This movie is a little corny but cute overall. The romance is a litte unrealistic but the movie takes you away from the day to day activities.
3,Nice bag but it wasn't pink..it was blue...,"The bag in the picture is pink, but they sent me a blue one. We weren't happy, but too much to send it back and no one responded, so we are stuck with a solid blue one. The bag is useful to hold stuff, smaller than a previous one my sister has. Wish it was the colored I ordered. The picture is deceiving!"
3,Does it's job,"Not really a toy, but a toy helper. It's lasted for over a year now, with no broken zippers, and the cardboard partitions are holding up well. My then 4, and now 5 year old takes it out every day, sometimes opening/closing and packing/unpacking her collection of LPS multiple times per day. It has taught her my favorite rule, that there's a place for everything, and everything has it's place. Helps keep the LPS jungle under control. :)"
4,Cardboard inside but kids still love it!,"I wasn't expecting any more with this kit than what was stated. I would have to say this toy met my expectations, but has a long way to go before it gets 5 stars from me. First, the inside of the carrying case is simply printed cardboard, thicker than your standard cereal box, but not as sturdy as a bisquick box. It is also stapled to the outer plastic case surprisingly. I can imagine MOST kids will pull that right out and then be left with nothing except a zippered case. Would I recommend this toy? No, I would step up to a better playset, and buy the 2 packs of pets seperately. Ours came with a frog and puppy. My daughters friend has the same puppy that was purchased seperately and it has a bow, but our puppy did not have a bow."
2,Not what is pictured!,"The case that comes is blue with Lamb and Iguana figures. I specifically ordered this one for my niece because the picture shows it as a pink case with Dog and Cat figures (her cousin already has the blue one and I didn't want them to get mixed up). Amazon said they can't control what color is sent, but they would let me return it and refund my money. When I contacted the seller, they wouldn't intervene at all since the order is fulfilled through Amazon. I took a chance and ordered a second one, but the second one was the same as the first - blue with the Lamb and Iguana. Someone at Amazon should change the picture to avoid further confusion."
3,an honest somewhat sry account,"i wanted to give this a higher rating but although there are some interesting anecdotes throughout the book, i think the writing style leaves a lot to be desired. the author has an immense amount of material to draw from but the results here are mostly wanting. i would have likes to have read more about his encounters with the press when he ran that room and some more of his back and forth with gore and hillary. he skims the surface--maybe with the intent for another book inthe future."
2,disapointment,"I must admit that I bought this album because of Charlie Hunter's participation. I'm a big Hunter fan and I'd read and heard good things about clark. I must say though that the album is disapointing. Charlie Hunter only takes one solo, but that's not what bugs me. It's the artist that do solo that bug me. Clark and Hunter do fine on the album, but none of the horn players who take most of the solos are particularly exciting. If you want some good funky jazz, I recomend checking out the Charlie Hunter Trio or the original quartet or some of Scofield's latest efforts like A Go Go, Bump, & Uberjam (all of these artists' albums are quite good though, these are the funky ones). However, if you're used to the likes of Karl Denson, Stanton Moore, or any of those types, you might like this album, and I don't say this to dis' Denson or Moore."
2,not quite satisfied,"The Tamron lens is not as sharp as I had hoped. The Opteka filters are dirty, difficult to clean, not good glass, certainly not as represented in the picture shown inasmuch as they are shown as being black metal ring exterior, whereas they are plain shiny metal which could create reflections. VERY disappointed about that in particular."
5,A stunning compilation,"This is truly an art book that invites you into the sensual, romantic and yes, dark, world created by the talented mind of Joseph Vargo. But it isn't only for those with an affinity for all things gothic. The artistry of his paintings along with a well written text make for a definitively inspiring read. The timeless appeal of his imagery is evocative and soulful. The stories inherent to each beautiful painting continuously unfold drawing the observer in ever deeper to the mysteries lurking within these lush and shadowy visions. This is not a book to be ""reviewed"", it is to be savored. Highly recommended!"
4,A Wonderful Introduction,"This book provides a wonderful introduction to some sun information--like the sun is a star; why it looks so much bigger than other stars; why there is night and day. The text is very well illustrated with pictures that help you ""see"" what is meant.There is a slight leap to the final conclusion of how the sun is always shining somewhere, which is why I give 4 stars rather than a full sunny 5! The leap can be grasped by children who have already read about the sun, or read other books on time zones, etc. Or who have intelligence in this area. Or who have a parent or teacher guiding them. Or for those who don't mind small logical leaps and can get there easily.This book is graphic and helpful. But not awe-inspiring."
4,better then i expected,"i actually had the privilage of seeing these guys live. they were fantastic. not only is the single great, but it's not their best work. i highly recommend this single because it will make you want more of them. enjoy..."
5,Great Pics and Info.,"Bought this for my son, he had a project in science and needed info and pictures. Nice pictures and detailed info."
5,Awesome book!,"This is a great mix between picture book and Encyclopedia. There are beautiful, colorful photos on each page as well as sufficient text facts and details of each animal/species. We are animal lovers so we bought this book to share with our son (currently only 8 months old); that being said, my one complaint is that it is not available in hardback. We'll be reading this with him, but I can foresee a replacement being needed in a few years!"
5,BLACKFOOT BOOGIE,"THIS ALBUM IS THE MOST SKYNYRD LIKE OF ALL BLACKFOOT'S ALBMS. SONGS ISLAND OF LIFE, FEELIN' GOOD, MADNESS ARE THE BEST ON THE ALBUM. THERE'S A COUPLE SONGS THAT ARE AVERAGE/OK AND YOU COULD SKIP BUT IT'S A GOOD ALBUM AND IT'S ANOTHER ALBUM THAT LP'S OF WERE SELLING FOR HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS. THANK GOD IT'S ON CD NOW."
3,Raw and unpolished southern rock,"This is a solid (vintage) southern rock album - no doubt about it. It has an unpolished rawness that got lost later on, especially on ""Vertical smiles"". Some people would consider this a lost gem!But the main problem with Blackfoot's ""Flyin' high"" is too little variation between the songs. The guitar riffs (often too many notes which gives a slightly frantic feeling) on which the songs are built around is very similar to one another, and the tempo of the songs are also rather similar. This results in a feeling that it's more or less one long song instead of ten different tunes. If you choose to play not more than a few songs each time (and not the whole album) you'll find it much better."
5,Blackfoot's Second Masterpiece In A Row,"FLYIN' HIGH is the second masterpiece in a row for Blackfoot. All of the songs here are great, with the exception of the album-closing ballad ""Mother"", and could teach a valuable lessson to anyone who needs a little kick in the tail to get their lives in order. The fact that the surviving members of Blackfoot advocate efforts to free people unjustly jailed in foreign countries, police use of deadly force to rescue two girls kidnapped in California in 2002, capital punishment for kidnappers, increased funding for law enforcement, and major federal crackdowns on polygamy, schools and programs affiliated with Scientology (e.g. Mace-Kingsley Ranch), and privately-run ""boot camps"" for troubled youth makes FLYIN' HIGH an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
1,A terrible piece of cinematic trash,"Lord, I wish I hadn't spent money on this thing. It's probably one of the worst movies I've ever spent ten minutes with. It ranks right there with ""Red Sands"", ""Warbirds"", and the re-make of ""The Day The Earth Stood Still."" Avoid this one at any cost...even if somebody wants to give you a copy. Want mine?"
3,Ray Harryhausen where were you......,when we needed you? What a stupid looking computer cyclops. Why does every movie today have to use computers for special effects? Computer effects have their place but only if they look real. The acting in the movie was also bad. The only real character I liked was the one Frida Farrell played (Barbara) and the only real reason I liked her was she looks good as a gladiator and has nice looking thighs. All that said: The plot is these roman soldiers capture a cyclops. He is put into a arena and that is all I'm going to say. For all the bad I just said for some reason however I liked it but if you want to see a better cyclops movie watch the 7th Voyage Of Sinbad.
1,Worst movie ever!,This is the worst movie ever made!! I threw it in the trash! I wasted 1 hour of my life watching this garbage. Don't waste your money and buy this trash
4,One-eyed one-meeeelion pleasures!!!,I am very thankful for the chance to purchase this movie online. The delivery was prompt and the condition was perfect! I would definitely buy from this merchant again.
3,TOO HARD!,ok i bought this game because i thought it was gonna be like the playstation game but i was totally wrong. u lose half ur health trying to kill a bird. i mean u have to find all these passages to get to a next level. even with the web ball it's still impossable i suggest u think about getting a diffrant game
2,THIS GAME IS WEIRD,"I usually really like stuff that is spider-man but man does this stink. The levels are way to long. And their is hardly any plot at all. Plus, I got stuck a lot of places."
4,Jet Li aka Li Lian-jie,This biography offers an indepth look at Jet Li's life. We see a humble little chinese boy from a poor family who through rigorous wushu training transforms from a martial artist into an action movie star. We also get an overview of his films and situations that lead up to him filming them. The book even manages to reveal personal things about this famous yet somewhat shy man. The only part I did not enjoy was when it implied some sort of rivalry between Jet Li and fellow martial artist turn movie star and friend Jackie Chan. Based on commnents from Mr. Li on his official website Jackie Chan is a friend of his and they socialize regularly. However overall this is a good book to buy if you want to learn more about this amazing man.
2,Ok for People that absolutely do not know about Jet Li,"Oh, man. How can this book get such good reviews? If you are already a Jet Li fan and have been going on his websites and checking out bios on the internet from his official site and the Jet Lee Homepage, then this book will mean absolutely nothing to you. The main focus of the book is one review of his movies after another. And it always has to give away all the plot twists and endings of the movies, leaving the movies dreadfully boring to watch, except for the fight scenes which no one can ignore. Good thing I watched all his movies before reading this book. If you watched maybe one of his movies and you like him, then you could get this book to decide which of his movies to watch next, but the info on JET LI in this book could be condensed to about 5 pages."
3,"Good, but not accurate","Simpson has done a good job of compelling the reader to see the power of a house church, but used other church models (small groups and cell group models in particular) as a straw man to make his case.Like so many prophetic voices, Simpson wrote with a sharp, critical tone when speaking about the larger body of Christ. In this regard, the book is lacking and could use a good edit to remove inflammatory statements that make him look like he's beating up the church instead of treating it gently.When this book first came out, it was the first book on the ""new and improved"" housechurch movement. Much has been written since and I personally believe a better, more balanced book to read on house churches is Larry Kreider's book, entitled, ""Starting A House Church"" which was just released in first quarter of 2007."
5,Great Blues & Rock-n-Roll,Check this disc out & you'll find out why even Bruce Springsteen was blown away upon hearing Southside Johnny. Southside & the Jukes are at their best. Southside's voice & harmonica are right on. The Miami Horns show why they are the premier horn section in rock-n-roll. Guests Lee Dorsey & Ronnie Spector are nice complements to Southside. Jersey shore rock-n-roll at its best.
3,Mediocre,A rather mediocre effort by a great author. I had expected a sensational read and was found myself just entertained without finding a real drive to find out more about the characters. I do plan to read the sequel The Glory and hope it gets better.
1,Disappointed,"OK - I went into this book hoping it would be a James Michener-type epic with sweeping characters and a grand sense of the rich field of Middle Eastern history since World War II. What I got was a romance novel about 3 men's boring love lifes and their boring affairs with a little war thrown in for spice.The book starts out well but becomes hopelessly sappy. In addition, I was irritated that the story was told exclusively from the Israeli point of view (undoubtedly since I was hoping for the more-inclusive Michener-type approach). I stopped reading about halfway through.My grade: F"
3,a good read,"The Hope is an interesting and informative story about the early years of Israel's history. Wouk's strength lies in his historical research rather than as a dramatic writer of fiction, and I found myself overlooking literary shortcomings while enjoying informative and exciting historical aspects. I found the romantic affairs of the charcters in ""The Hope"" to be completely superfluous. Unlike Wouk's ""Winds of War,"" in which the romantic liasons between characters could be said to represent the historically-relevant changes in women's roles and sexual mores, the affairs between characters in ""The Hope"" seem to add nothing of value to the overall story either from a historical angle nor a narrative one. But nonetheless, it was a good book and I'm glad I took the time to read it."
4,Good Enough,Compared with some of Wouk's earlier books THE HOPE is definitely not as good as his other efforts written in an epic style such as THE WINDS OF WAR or WAR AND REMEMBRANCE. It also is not as gripping as EXODUS by Leon Uris but I still recommend THE HOPE to anyone who loves Israel and its history.
3,NO CD for playalong,"Hal dropped the ball on this one!If there is a CD that goes with this Bass tab white pages, please, let me know so I can buy it, I am a beginner and can use all the help I can buy, oops i mean, get.Great tool to have, but no CD to play along."
4,Why buy Bass tab white pages,As a 62 year old and having never played a guitar in my life I went out and bought a Yamaha bass.I got free lessons on the net from Andrew Pouska at www.studybass.com and boughtBass Guitar for Dummiesby Patrick Pfeiffer an equally wonderful teacher .but I wanted to play real songs so bought what I consider one of my best buys Bass tab white pages. It contains a selection of songs to suit everyone.with this book you too could be like me after only three months of owning my own guitar I now play in my own band . GO FOR IT .
4,Good product,"Bought book for 16 year old bass player son instead of lessons, as he's a self-taught player, and any lessons I've tried enrolling him for don't teach him anything he doesn't already know. Was more like just paying someone to sit there and play with him. This book gave him the new songs he wanted to play and the challenge he needed w/o having to pay outrageous prices for someone to give him new songs to play."
4,Good Book,"This book is very good. Some of the tabs are not as good as some that are found on the internet, but all in all most of them are good."
3,Good but not Great.,"This is an interesting selection of basslines, but for the most part is not a compilation of ""GREAT"" bass performances from Rock. There are some real weird choices in here, that I wouldn't even consider the best bass performance from those bands, ie Metallica choices are just off. No Rush whatsoever, just weird songs. Probably due to licensing issues.Wish they would do a book of truly 200 of the BEST actual basslines."
5,LOVE IT,GREAT! I'm a beginner bass player and this book lets me walk into learning my favorite songs!
5,Lenny White is a drum God!,Nothing like a great drummer to put down great groves.To me he is the stand out.I'm a person who loves guitar and bass and most of all drums.If you understand drums you would know these licks are very off time and very technical.Stanley Clarke is a great bass player i know his tone right away same with al diemola.Anyway if you like jazz rock(fusion)and drumming get this album.
2,I really dont get it....,"I first became interested in fusion the day my dad threw the mahavishnu record Visions of Emerald Beyond on his turntable. The sheer power and emotion of that record assaulted me completely. I then listened to RTF's Light as a Feather and the mellow chords and melodies entranced me. I then listened to Where Have I Known You Before by RTF and I was floored by the drive, the bass playing, the guitar playing, the drumming, and chick corea's synths and piano work. That album is a masterpiece. Later I went out and bought Romantic Warrior... just after 10 minutes of trying to cope with the cheesy synths and boring grooves, I had to turn it off. This is a landmark of the commercialization of fusion and nothing more. Ive been trying to understand why there was such a sudden turn from the previous album's energy and enthusiasm, and why this album is so popular."
3,The TOTO of Jazz,"For twenty five years this album set the standard for wasted talent.The only collection of all-stars to come home so shortchanged were the 2004 LA Lakers.Clearly, this is a case of the whole adding up to less than the sum of the parts. That being said, however, there are some fine moments. Al DiMeola never sounded more nasty, bluesy and powerful than on this mid-70s set. Stanley Clarke is up to his usual sonic genius. There is also plenty of great interplay among all these wonderful players.The problems stem from their forays into clasical music that are pretentious, dated and silly.There is really nothing memorable as far as songs go, rather like TOTO, they come off as fine studio musicians who have nothing to say and no way to say it."
2,KJhsfv,"This is album with no emotion, passion or sense at all!!!!!!!! It sounds like a computer midi file."
5,just review,"I love this album, pure electronic fusion. A bit different from other Return To Forever albs. Al Di Meola did a great job, only Flora is missing, but electronic instrumental music of this quality sounds great. If anything I'm missing is more people of my age (22) listening to this style."
5,a bunny rabbit,"this is the only other jazz/fusion album that i have kept repeating for weeks at a time. every song is so well done i just dont have words. you need to listen to this album if you havent yet. if you like jazz, fusion, music in general you will buy this album if you dont have it yet"
4,"Return to Forever's ""Romantic Warrior""","I was very impressed after buying this album (my first Return to Forever CD). Being entirely instrumental, this album tells more stories than any words could ever tell. One of the best ""stories"" on the CD (to me) is the first one, entitled ""Medieval Overture."" It starts off like you're in outer space, then becomes incredibly upbeat, truly a great jazz song. The second song ""Sorceress"" is more of a ""funk jazz"" song, starting off with a cool bass intro. My favorite song, though, is ""Majestic Dance,"" a song that is centered around the skills of the ""guitar wizard"" Al DiMeola. This CD wasn't meant to have songs to get on the radio so they could make money, like a lot of today's bands. They use their enormous musical talent to write songs that people can feel, rather than just sing along with. All in all, this CD is a wonderfully different jazz/fusion composition."
5,Return to Forever,My husband LOVES this album and didn't think it existed on CD anywhere. He was SSOO happy to get it. We both are Chick Corea fans.
4,An enjoyable read,"This is actually two books published together ""Timediver's dawn"" and ""the timegod"". They are a complementry pair that are a beginning and end of a story, although there are different main characters in each book.I had not read these novels before I picked up this book, though I'd seen them around at some point. They reminded me in theme and story of an earlier novel by this author called ""the hammer of darkness"". They all deal with the subject of timetravel, space, power and gods.These books are pure fantasy. This author has an unusual writing style and creates strange worlds. I would have to say that ""the timegod"" seemed to go slower than the first book ""timediver's dawn"". Both are a good read if you like fantasy or this author. Value for money, with 2 books in 1."
5,Great Writing,This book is beautifully written. I wish I could describe people and places and things the way Mark Spragg does. This is a a great picture of life in western Wyoming.
2,Where Rivers Change Directions Review,This is a very poorly written book with no continuity. A documentary should flow from one age to another. How it ever won any awards amazes me. I could never tell what age he was in any paragraph let alone in any chapter. The best written and easiest chapter to read was the last chapter. Very depressing but you at least could follow the train of thought and what he was feeling. His editor should have been fired on this one and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone to read or waste their time. Frankly I would have stopped reading it after the first 50 pages (I give every book that much of a shot) if it hadn't been our book club reading choice.Barb S.Montana
1,Portraits of My Life: Looking Back As a Adult Child of Alcoholism,"I ordered this book because I too am an adult child of an alcoholic. The book is a collection of letters written by the author about her relationship with her father an alcoholic and her relationship with her mother the woman who married him. I don't know where you would find this book in a book store, it is not fiction, it is not a biography or a autobiography, and it certainly not a self help book. The subject of the book spiked my interest, the writing did not!!"
5,Heart of Texas Hits the Top,"Sometimes authors who are as prolific as Ms. O'Banyon get into a rut, but I am pleased to find that Ms. O'Banyon's books are always fresh and different. HEART OF TEXAS is no exception. What you can expect from Ms. O'Banyon is a well-crafted story with characters, that whether good or bad, are so real you would swear the book isn't fiction."
3,The title is misleading!,"I don't know what film the other guy saw, but the movie I watched was made sometime in the early 70s or late 60s, and it's about this crazy dude who thinks all women are sluts. This stems from the unorthodox way he was raised by his mother. He escapes from this mental institution after attacking, and nearly sexually assaulting a nurse. Then goes home, rapes/murders the maid, kidnaps her daughter, and then goes to murder his mother as well. Not a bad movie to watch if you can get past the cheesy disco music and hokey slow motion effects in the final scenes.I think the title is misleading, because there are no dismemberments or decapitations in it that I can recall. It isn't even technically a horror film. It's more like a drama/suspense thriller."
3,this game is ok,This game is very fun when you first play it but it gets boring fast! The graphics are good and there are many ways to kill your opponet. This game is pretty much the same the whole game there are alot of badguys and the bosses are almost impossible.The worst thing about this game is once you beat a level the next levels are exactly the same!
3,Too friggin' short!!,"Blade is a game with nice graphics and control and the battles with bosses are cool (you get to block and slash with a sword) and the concept and gameplay is quite original, complete with attribute upgrades. The only problem with that game is it's too short. It took me like 45 minutes to beat it. But, the game has quite some replay value so it won't be a waste of money at all, it is so well done."
2,not so good,this game was not so good. it had a lack of wepons. only 4 or 5. it was very short. with 7 levels i beat it in an hour. the bosses were very easy and your statas advences to quickly. i don't see how this game has any connectionwith the movie. i wouldn't buy it if i were anybody
2,Standard side scroller with the Daywalker,"Blade for the GameBoy Color is yet another 2-D basic side scroller which would be practically generic were it not for the fact of the Blade license. Playing as Blade, you have control over a very small array of weaponry, and you run from side to side taking on a horde of vampires and beasts; all of which amounts to at least 45 minutes of gameplay. There's no replay value to Blade, and the bosses are easy to beat. The graphics are colorful and are standard GBC graphics, while the control is easy to get the hang of. This might be worth a rental at best for fans of Blade, but besides that this one belongs on the shelves."
1,Broke within minutes!!!!,I own several Freud bits and blades they are generally exceptional. This bit broke almost immediately. Think I will try a different manufacturer for this item as half the reviews say it broke quickly.
1,Broke in under 5 minutes,This is a fairly expensive router bit and I generally like Freud products but this bit broke after literally 5 minutes of use. I was using it to cut a circle into a piece of red oak (granted a taxing task for any bit) but I definitely don't think that it's okay for a $20 bit to break after such a short amount of time. After it broke I used my Ryobi bit to pick up the slack and it did just fine for the rest of the task.
3,Not a bad little outfit.,"This coat is lightly lined. The hat might be a tad big for the size of the coat. My LO has a very large head (over 90th percentile), and the hat was quite loose when the coat fit perfectly. He's a relatively long baby (75th percentile) but not too bulky (50th percentile). However, it's a cute outfit and he got some good use out of it."
5,Brilliant!!,"I was hoping they would release more than just Season One of this magnificent show. I could not sleep one night and by chance saw one episode from the first season. I was crying from laughing so hard. I immediately went out and bought the DVD's and have enjoyed them ever since. Admittedly I have not seen any episodes other than season one but what makes this show is the writing and I can't imagine that much of a downfall. Some of my favorite scenes from Season One....The camping scene from ""Yoko""---- Eugene ""I peed in Coach Mcguirk's canteen."" ""Tastes like pee turkey.""Mcguirk is living with Melissa and Erik and he tries the yoga. Ok, it's immature but the fart jokes still crack me up.My favorite, Jason, ""What question would you like to 'axe' me?""Oh man, I'm laughing just thinking about it. On par with Family guy."
2,Disappointing New Gettel CD,"It is fair to say I was really excited about receiving Michael Gettel's latest CD; the beauty of his piano playing on his earlier title ""San Juan Suite"" impressed me beyond words. ""Disappointed"" is an understatement as the disc played through.The words ""just ordinary"" spring to mind. None of the compositions reached out and grabbed me, each track came and went with no so much as an ounce of excitement. What has happened to this man's melodic gift?Technically, the CD is fine, with the tracks being split evenly between Gettel and his wife.No magic here."
2,better off alone,"being a long time fan of michael,this cd is a dissapointment for me.the songs lack the melodious gift he showed in albums like san juan suite 1 and 2 . the music is timid,and by playing just the piano,you need a strong melody to capture the listeners attention. and for the fans of albums like the journey north ; this performance is too flat anyway."
2,Michael Gettel's Latest Offering,"It is fair to say I was really excited about receiving Michael Gettel's latest CD; the beauty of his piano playing on his earlier title ""San Juan Suite"" impressed me beyond words. ""Disappointed"" is an understatement as the disc played through.The words ""just ordinary"" spring to mind. None of the compositions reached out and grabbed me, each track came and went with no so much as an ounce of excitement. What has happened to this man's melodic gift?Technically, the CD is fine, with the tracks being split evenly between Gettel and his wife.No magic here."
5,A truly special album from a truly special artist.,"A wonderful album...perhaps her best work. ""Some Enchanted Evening"" will move you to tears."
4,ABSOLUTELY RAVISHING VOICE,"My title says it all - she's must be the best kept secret, I reckon.My personal feeling is that the repertoir is simply not as good as the performer. That said... with such a gorgeous, flawless sound and inteligent interpretation, it almost doesn't matter... (I never thought I would ever say something like that). Just think what she could do with some classy arrangements and some quality material!!"
2,First Night,This CD needs to be digitally remastered due to lack of sound quality. Not some of Jane's best songs.
3,great product.,"I used it for 4-5 months until I ran out. I have been off of it for almost 1 month now and can't really feel a difference, so maybe it is still working in my system. I should know more in the next few months without it."
3,it is ok,I found this product in one of the health/natural store and the woman explained that this would help to relieve the muscle/join inflammation due to excessive workout but I am not sure if I see any result. It might not work for me but that doesn't mean it doesn't work.......
5,Truly helps with energy,"Have chronic fatigue and sometimes this is all that gets me through the day. Tried Now brand, also a good value but this one mixes and tastes better. Both help with energy. Started with 2 scoops/day for 2 months and reduced to 1/day. Have read it dies not work for everyone and that some people don't need to continue indefinitely as I do. On bad days I increase the dose."
5,It's Amazing,I am a new fan because of this CD. She has an incredible voice and diverse talent. There are many different flavors of music infused in her songs. Definitly not boring. All songs are great.
