1,Late Delivery,"Today is the last day of the estimated shipping date, but i still didn't receive my watch. I am wondering when my package will arrive because i already payed it 3 weeks ago!! I am still patient... and will give a full comment when my package arrived..."
4,Great companion book for Scotland,This is a great little book to take as a companion book to your Scotland guidebook. Good information on castles . . just enough to be interesting.
4,great death/grind band!!,"i just heard of this band and felt like buying the cd.man,i was glad i did.this is a great piece of death metal.i urge you to try this band out."
4,Bears mini helmets,"I ordered 2 Chicago Bears mini helmets and did get what I ordered. The helmets were new, but had some scratches on them. Overall they were in very good shape."
4,Pretty Good,"I've listned to many japenise anime music, like Dragonball Z, Gundam Wing and many others. Like any anime soundtrack this soundtrack has soul. I've got to say this soundtrack realy is good to duel by. But of course the lyerics are american-ized. making the lyrics sound like it's meant for 7 year olds. But i can't say that about all the songs though. I'm amazed that even though that this soundtrack apeals from kids age 7-15. My thoughts- I think if you play the card game and you collect every card, you should buy it, but if you just wach the cartoon show, you should have seconed thoughts."
2,It's okay,"The CD.....it's okay. Though I haven't bought the CD myself, but I did hear sample soundtracks, it's not really that good than the Japanese version. I had my high expectation on the CD, but apparently it wasn't what I thought it would be. Sure the dueling music can be great for dueling against a friend or family member but it doesn't give you that feel to the edge that you can and can't win."
4,Yu-Gi-Oh fans only,"I love this CD and all its songs, a great Joey vs Yugi song. You have to have seen the series to understand though. That's why i give this CD only 4 stars. Otherwise it would be 5 ^.^Enjoy the sound of Yu-Gi-Oh! ;)"
4,Good CD,This CD has got some cool tunes on it but if I had known about Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie soundtrack when this one had come out I would have left this one alone. Buy Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie Soundtrack!My favourite song on this was the Heart of The Cards except for the Yu-Gi-Oh! Bit.This CD is quite good but i like Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie soundtrack much better.
3,"Bizarre, but not bad","Upon listening to this, I got the same flushing embarassment that one got from actually borrowing from the library, the soundtrack to ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turles 2:The Secret of the Ooze"" (You remember that?Go ninja, go ninja go!) One you get past the fact that people were paid to put together songs about a kid's show where people play trading cards (who would've thought that it would be so engrossing, either), most of these songs are pretty neat. These guys were obviously inspired to make something that doesn't suck. And it worked."
1,One of the worst cd's i have ever purchased,"i can't put into words how awful this cd is. The song ""face up face down"" is by far the worst song i have ever heard."
1,PARENTS BEWARE,There is a cuss word on this CD! Most people don't notice it....Parents - Look out if you don't want your kid to learn the f-word.
3,Whatever,"Its okay, though I don't remember most ofthe songs being on the show except I'm Back and No Matter What. The thing that made me give it a low rating is that they had sample songs on CD's at McDonald's (I think; it may have been Buger King ; one of those anyway) and on the sample CD it had One Card Short and Panic along with another song I forgot the name of and none of these songs were on the actual CD which was misleading but I guess the CD can't be blamed for that"
4,cd maniac,I think its fad it's cool for a while for duelers and then it wears off after a while unless you love yugioh so much it can never wear off
5,it's a great cd no one can beat it in my opion,this cd rocks on ice all yugioh fans should have it each one is longer than the music on tv show and I love it long and it is never boring. I espically like no.3 which is about Kaiba and no. 13 which is theHeart of the Cards. I also like no. 1 The Yugioh Theme.
3,Yu-Gi-Oh! Fans ONLY!,"This is a good music CD. If you're a fan of Yu-Gi-oh!, this is one of those must-have items.However if you're not a fan of Yu-Gi-Oh!, you may find the songs a bit silly.Yugioh Theme - 10/10 - This is the full theme!Time to Duel - 10/10 - My favorite song!I'm Back - 7/10 - Ok song, not my favoriteSummon the Dragon - 6/10 - Boring songYour Move - 10/10 - Makes you wanna duelDuel Madness - 5/10 - Only Yugioh! fans will like this songNo Matter What - 10/10 - Great Song!Exodia - 4/10 - Another instrumental!Ahead of the Game - 5/10 - WAAY too repetative!We'll Be There - 0/10 - By FAR the worst song on the CD!Face Up Face Down - 5/10 - Pegasus? Singing? LOL!Millenium Battle - 4/10 - ANOTHER instrumental!Heart of the Cards- 1/10 - 2nd worst song in the CD.World of Yu-Gi-Oh!- 10/10 - One of the best song on the CD!Overall: This CD is ONLY for Yu-Gi-Oh! fans! If you don't like Yu-Gi-Oh!, you should stay far away from this CD."
3,Rayban Quality is Deoendable,"Rayban quality is first-rate, and Miki Paris' services as regards communications and delivery times can't be topped."
5,What can I say but incredible!,"Being an Anime fan, it surprised me that I stumbled upon this series by accident. But in all honesty, I'm glad I did. I have always liked EVANGELION but never knew that a series of books had been published.When I picked this book up at my local book store, I found that I wasn't able to put it down. The art work and the story blend together beautifully, and will keep you entertained long after your first reading.The book and movie series are wonderful, and are some of the finest the Japan has ever produced. In my opinion, NEON GENESIS EVANGELION ranks #2 on my list of favorite Anime, just below Hayao Miyazaki's epic masterpiece, PRINCESS MONONOKE.Read it, I know that you'll enjoy it."
5,Excellent!!! One of the best all around baseball coaches books....,"I highly recommend this book to any coaches that want to take their game to the next level. The one thing that this book does is break down every aspect of the game and gives you many, many ideas on how to implement the strategies explained.I have been coaching baseball for 7 years at the high school level and have attended many baseball coaches clinics throughout the United States. I have learned many things at these clinics.The beauty of this book is that it something that you can continue to reference back to again and again. This book has definitely aided to my players development. From defensive strategies to times to use the run game, this game covers it all.I have also loaned this book out to other coaches and they have enjoyed it also.If you are looking to take your coaching to the next level, I highly recommend this book."
5,Healthy plant,Ordered this for my Mom who has high standards for plants. She got it delivered to her door in 3 days and liked it so much she asked me to order another one for her. She said it was healthy and had good size.
2,Too depressing after the movie,"The music on this CD is fabulous in the movie, which plays out with a different sort of plot than NUTS, yet similarly dramatic. POT, the music enhances the movie's drama without being overbearing. However, on it's own, if you've seen the movie first, or went through the rooting for Barbra to finally find love in real life (POT was produced before she met James Brolin), the music, while including a couple passionate pieces, is too depressing to stand out as a best. Well done, but grab something instrumentally funny or you might end up under some heavy violins for a while. Might have felt differently about this one if I didn't see the movie first."
5,amazing,Amazingly score for a heart touching movie. James Newton Howard capture the fragile and emotive story of Nolte and Streisand so beautifully that makes your heart trembling! a must have!
3,A classic beach flick!,"This is not a movie to take seriously, but it is great to watch 10 years later while remembering what it was like to dream of being a beach bum for the rest of your life. Even though the acting is weak and the surf footage is sub-par, it will still entertain you after all these years."
2,kind of lame,"If you want pictures of bluegill, trout and bass on your screen, get this. The fish are very 2d-ish and move more like pac-man than fish. When they eat the bay fish, they eat them just like pac-man too. Maybe that is the engine they used to make this. I would hold out out for a later revision of this software."
3,Another catalog.,"I'm not sure what to think about this book. Sometimes I read it with joy. At other times I wonder why I bought it. Nice pics, little advice on building."
5,The Art and Craft of Living Out on a Limb,"Dear Sir/Madam,i love this book because it is what i would choose for a treehouse.It is next to nature as well the construction of it.I adore the stairs with so many stepsand of course the old fashion makeup.Very secluded area and greenary.Lovey."
5,Truly Inspiring,"I had this book as a child....absolutely inspiring, this book opened my eyes to the many possibilities and forms of treehouses. The masterpiece doesn't explore many specific details on any one construction method...but provides enough imagery and general info on the subject so that anyone with a knack for building could take an idea from the book and make it a reality. A great read all-around, I would highly recommend it for kids interested in nature and construction!"
2,From the heart but what about the trees?,I bought this book as I always loved climbing trees in England as a child. This book hit a cord straight in the heart ! if you love trees and feel a deep connection to them this book will hurt like hell ! The poor trees have to take nails and drilled holes all over to support our homes. Unlike the birds we yet again end up destroying. Um I guess this isn't paradise for the trees any way you look at it. But lets not become the chains that literally bind them. This book inspires one to feel for the trees freedom not my own.
2,Interesting at a high level,"I was looking for something practical to help me design and build a tree house for my 5 year old. This is a great book if you want to consider ""possibilities"". It helped a little, as well in terms of providing conceptual designs. It was not as good in providing detailed plans on how to build a specific tree house. If you are an experienced builder you could probably take what they have here and develop your own blueprints. If you are a novice,and need detailed plans this book will not get you there."
4,good light reading...,"Shakespeare fans are in for a great surprise. I was enthralled at the idea of drawing parallels between Shakespeare's works and management concepts. The book was not exactly a humorous book like I'd expected. It was a great read on a short flight. Some analogies like the one about Murphy's Law seemed contrived though... Also serves as a good reference guide to own, for those who ever read excerpts from Shakespeare's works and said ""Oh even in that era, the business fundamentals were the same, and Shakespeare sure appreciated them""!"
5,Audubon's Elephant,"Excellent biography of Audubon. Most interesting, well written.I liked it so much I bought a copy for myself & give the originalto a friend!"
3,cd,I would not recommend this to anybody. The name of the songs and the song played are not the same
4,Good simple to use thermostat,"I have had this thermostat for a little over 3 years now. It holds the temp rock steady wherever it is set. I am just now getting ready to change out the first set of batteries in it. My only minor complaints about it is that it does not monitor line voltage, as in, if the power briefly goes out in a storm, it does not shut down and lock out the AC compressor for a timeout to let the pressures drop and protect the compressor. My old Hunter did that. The 2nd minor complaint is that it is hard to tell when it is in temp hold mode instead of program run mode. I really like the big backlit touchscreen."
5,worth every penny,"This is a great programmable thermostat. It has great functions like ""filter counter"" to track how long not just your filter has been in, but how many hours has it been actually filtering. Other more essential functions are great.Really easy to use. The copy/paste function is a bit awkward, but if you read the user manual when you need to use it, you'll get it.A+"
3,Boxed item?,"The description for this item does notsay if it includes the cooler and fan,and therefore the 3 yr. warranty.Amazon did not know. Thanks."
4,Best Choice for Infant Car Seat,"After checking all the reviews and prices for infant car seats, we purchased the Britax Companion for our newborn. We are VERY pleased with our decision.Positives:SAFE, SAFE, SAFEPrice is compromise between cheap and 'high-end' seatsHigh quality product - sturdy and comfortable for our little guy Side-impact/head supportAnti-rebound bar on baseCoordinating Britax Preview StrollerDrawbacks:Hard to find (not in any stores in our area and out of stock most of the time online)Heavier than most infant car seats (but this is also a positive)Handle hard to move, especially with canopy in place (but it is getting easier after 2 months of use)"
4,Safe but hot and heavy,"After a lot of research my husband and I got the Companion for our daughter, we both felt very safe with her in it. However our daughter is a baby that runs hot, and this seat does not have breathable fabic, she is always hot in it! Also the seat is very heavy which I agree means safe but it is so hard to carry even on short trips like from the car into the post office and back. Also since it is bigger than most car seats it's hard to take into a restaurant. Most car seats will fit in the wooden high chairs turned upside down, however the companion does not and a lot of the times it doesn't fit in a booth either. As with people saying it's hard to get into the base we found that if you hold the release handle and push down at the same time it goes in first time every time. I would buy the companion again because I feel it's worth the extra effort, just go into knowing it's not the most user friendly but it's the safest!"
5,"Heavy and bulky, but worth it","Yes, this car seat is heavy and bulky, but I feel it's worth it. It's very well built, and the bulk and weight enable it to absorb more impact. The inflatable head restraint is great. It's also larger than some other car seats, so you'll be able to use it longer. I didn't pick the car seat for convenience, I picked it for safety, and this one is the best.On the downside, it might not fit into a small car. It fit into Mazda Protege and Toyota Corolla with no room to spare.Also, the release handle on the back is difficult to access, and the buttons that move the handle are tough to press. So what? As long as it offers the best protection, I'll live with the inconveniences."
1,a complete dud,"The seat is too heavy to carry even WITHOUT the baby, making the portable option all but worthless. The seat is so deep it's hard to take the baby in and out (and since I have to do this and leave the seat in the car due to its weight, the baby always wakes up).The fabric is very hot, and the straps are very awkward. I never want to leave the house. The seat sticks in the base and the straps are hard to loosen.I would not buy this car seat again. It's a hassle. The stroller that works with it (forerunner) is just as bad, and I cannot usually fold it. It's simply too hard to do. Despite high safety ratings, if a seat is so bad the parents never want to take the baby anywhere, what's the point? Maybe the reason it's so safe is because using it encourages the parents and baby to never even get in a car and risk an accident."
3,Too big,"I'm sending this carseat back because it's just too big. I really like the safety features it offers, but it's not worth it. Not only is it heavy, but it's bulky. It seems like it would be very awkward to carry and it doesn't fit well in either of our vehicles, a VW Passat and a Ford Escape. There is no room between the back of this carseat and the back of the seat in front of it, which makes it nearly impossible to get out because the handle that releases it from the base is right there. It is also impossible to put the handle down once it's in the car because of the lack of space, and it says the handle is supposed to be down when it's not being carried."
1,DID NOT PASS CRASH TESTING!!!,Make sure you do your homework before buying this. The latest consumer report says that this seat did not pass the latest crash testing. That's a lot of money to spend for it not to pass!!!
4,Excellent Resource,"I disagree with the other reviewer. This wonderful text is not at all hard for the average reader (see Gramsci's view of the great intellectual potential of the working class). This is not that challenging of a read, but it is too brief. I wish the sections were a bit longer -- but that's the only drawback of this book. Also, the term ""post-Marxism"" does not refer to just any Marxism after Marx. It refers specifically to the post-structuralist Marxism devised by Laclau and Mouffe. Marxism after Marx is generally just called Marxist Theory. I would just like to end by saying that so-called ""average people"" are smarter than a lot of us think, and we should be more respectful of the proletariat at all times."
1,VERY Poor Quality,"I just installed (or attempted to install) this mirror glass around ten minutes ago ...the glass was extremely thin (between 1/16"" and 1/8"") and fragile ;it shattered in my hands as I attempted to apply it to the 2 pathetically small and inadequate adhesive strips that were provided.Just so you know, I have bought and installed these before and the quality of this product was drastically inferior to any I've seen.Bottom line:I wasted my timeI wasted my money ... and I still need a side mirror for my truck."
5,Most Original Vollenweider,"Whilst his other works are very pretty, and Book of Roses does have its pretty moments, this piece stands out for its changing pace and variety. Vollenweider is much bolder here with his Rock moments and so the entire event isn't as soporific as his other more tranquil works. It has elegance,even humour and surprise. Vollenweider recordings improved in the mid 80s and this 92 release is another exceptional recording. It is a real treat for the senses. It is probably no coincidence that this CD is often used to impress at hi-fi shows. It isn't difficult music to reproduce, but, oh boy does it make a system sing!:-)"
1,BE CAREFUL WITH THESE LOCKS...THEY ARE NOT STANDARDIZED!!,"I purchased 10 packs of these locks and had such a difficult time installing them that they are now sitting on my shelf as multiple ""shelf racks"".I paid ~ $14 for each of these locks and they are not standard. The other writer was correct. The part that you install on the inside of the hole is longer than that of kwikset, schlage and other standardized locks.I did not have a drill or a tool to increase the depth of my existing circle for the hole and as a result, could not get the piece to fit.I spent almost an hour trying to install one lock and I can normally install a quickset or other lock in about 6 to 10 minutes.I am dissapointed and do believe in the old saying that ""YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR"". What I got was a waste of my money.*******Right now they are retailing for $29.99 and they are not worth the $14 that I paid for them.Thanks Amazon for letting me share my opinion."
1,poor quality -- fell apart in 2 month's time,"I really love the practical design of this product but really have to warn other customers about the quality. the handle is secured to the case by a pair of vinyl loops that are less than one half inch wide. these ended up tearing after 2 months of use. the material used as ""edging"" around the sides of the product lost it's black finish within the first week, it is very susceptible to wear, leaving you with a scratched/cloth exposure wherever it has come into any type of stress. IE when you set it down...."
3,Bad attitude ruins the book,"This book would have gotten 4 or 4.5 stars, if not for the negative attitude that the writers display when writing about Hong Kong's various attractions. ""Act impressed""? Gee, thanks for that advice. How Lonely Planet. It's a nice book, unfortunately ruined by the tone, which sounds like it was written by a bunch of bored expats who mainly sit around in bars and binge drink. If you want to buy this, then be prepared for the bad vibes this book gives off, and please do not let it ruin a wonderful experience in Hong Kong."
3,They are OK,"Got these to replace my VERY old Remo Soundmaster Heavy coated heads and my stock bass head. The bass sounds good, the snare sounds alright, but the toms sound absolutely horrible. Could not get them in tune for anything. I dont know if it is because they are one-ply or if they just suck. They make my Pearl Exports sound like a First Act Walmart kit. I ended up putting the old Remos back on and putting Attack heads on the resonant side. I honestly do not understand how these have gotten such good reviews on sites like MF.Overall Im glad I got these. I needed new res heads anyway. And my bass is a lot punchier now. For the price these are a steal."
4,great debut,"These guys rock. Ive been listening to them nonstop since the CD came out. Great sound if you like Taking Back Sunday, or Brand New. They are touring with TBS, remember this band, as they will be well known very soon."
2,Not what it is all cracked up to be,"Ok Ok ok...so yeh the reason i bought the cd was because it said on the case ""the best band ever"" - TBS...and I like TBS so i took there advice. Much to my mistake, so they are ok, they aren't great or even good they are ok. At least the cd is, i dont know about live shows, thats how i tend to rate bands but this cd could have been alot better. The production is horrible they try to do too difficult of unision rhythms and they can't pull them off. Sometimes the drummer sounds like he just randomly drops his stick on the snare. The singer is nothing special, the guitarist is choppy. I mean there is nothing on this cd that is just flat out good, but then again its not live....so take it which ever way you want it but to me they should of spent a little more time in the studio"
2,are these guys tone deaf?,DO not buy this cd. For all the generic pop-punk/emo whatever bands there are these days...Northstar is among the worst. The production is seriously lacking. Songwriting and compositional skills need much work. Listening to this cd...you realize that the band is NOT very tight. It's sloppy. The vocals are probably the worst thing I've ever heard on a punk record. PLease support bands that truly deserve your dollar and respect. As for Northstar...they didn't let me down because I wasn't expecting very much from a band with such a stupid name.
5,Northstar - Is This Thing Loaded,"Northstar have released a ten (10) track public display of Nick Torres' insides. ""Is This Thing Loaded,"" exhibits the most lyrical competence of any rock record in 2002. By far the strongest disc Triple Crown stamped their approval on that year. The riffs are raw and erosive sounding; yet Torres' effortless vocal delivery meshes impeccably with the blistering music. These down South rockers have turned a lot of heads with their debut triumph, and rightfully so. Northstar shows promise for what lies ahead in the Rock music scene. Check Out ""Rigged and Ready,"" and ""Taker Not A Giver.""5/5"
4,Northstar definately deserves some credit for this one.,"Northstar brings out a uncomparable combination of hard riffs and the sweetest vocals out there. I absolutely adore the vocals. Check out 'my richochet' and 'rigged and ready', my favs for this album. If you like these songs go out and get this album! Enjoi"
5,Northstar is the only band worth listening to,"Is This Thing Loaded? is one of the best cd that triple crown records has ever put out. Buy this cd and listen to it, you won't want to listen to anything else. Its not a hard metal type rock, or a soft rock, its just right! This is the best band and I will keep supporting them. Go Northstar!!!"
4,"One scent good, one innaccurate","I've tried Holy Water and Paperback.First, the bad: while paperback was a perfectly lovely scent, it had nothing to do with paperbacks. Smelled, actually, pretty exactly like cookie dough or cake batter. Raw flour, vanila, sugar, eggs- the works. It's lovely but absolutely nothing like the cedar-dust-sweet ink smell of a book. I did give it a bit of time, and rhe sweetness faded a bit, but still not enough to call it bookish.Second, the really, really good: Holy Water is gorgeous. It took a bit to settle on, but when it did it smelled glorious on my skin and hair. Smelled like the best part of church as a kid, like beswax and incence. I think they did this one because they liked the smell but the Holy Smoke one had too much of a smoke overtone, so this might be HS without the smoke... Whatever, it's really, really nice."
1,"Disgusting, Smells Nothing Like Books",I bought this for my librarian sister. It smells NOTHING like books. It's very overwhelming and smells more like the perfume your great grandmother bathes in prior to a big shindig. I am so very disappointed!
3,Almost but not quite right,"I ordered this Scosche connector and the Metra 70-7301 for my '01 Santa Fe thinking that if one didn't work the other would. I would rate this connector only three stars for two reasons:1) The Scosche connector lacks one of the two wires (has orange, lacks orange/black) for illumination on the head unit. There should be two, one for +12 volts from the lighting circuit (hot with lights on) and the other for the controlled ground regulated by the dimmer for the dash lights. On most aftermarket head units the controlled ground isn't used so the illumination simply lights with the park light circuit, but if you have a HU with the controlled ground feature so the illumination dims with the car's dash lighting, this connector won't work. Even if the ground isn't used it still should be there.2) The Metra connector has both wires for front panel illumination, costs less, and works very well."
1,NOT INSTRUMENTAL,"This is a short but not bad collection of Zydeco music. I bought it because the title say ""All Instrumental"", the description says ""Instrumental"" The voices singing on all the tracks say otherwise. Again, it is fine if you want a zydeco collection but I would have bought a different album if they had advertised correctly"
4,This couldn't get much better.,"I really enjoyed this book. It was a little slow in the middle, but on the whole it was very good. Zoe was a really strong woman and is trying to do what a million of other women are trying to do. It is nice to read of one doing well and making it against all the odds."
2,Cute,"Ok I want a djinni. I mean who wouldn't. Well the heroine of this book didn't. Her daughter and her wacky neighbor conjured him up and now she has to deal with him. Now if he looked like the cover mode I could think of several ways to ""deal"" with him but its not my story so I won't go into those.I liked Simon. He was a marvel. He took his djinni duties seriously but longed for the freedom that had been denied him. I didn't care much for Zoe, the heroine, though. She seemed too interested in her business than in her daughter and of course in Simon. I mean it was good that she wanted her business to succeed but at what cost. I just felt that her character could have lightened up a bit. She did come to her senses a bit toward the end.I did enjoy the secondary characters. They added to the total mayhem and brought lots of humor to the book. I would love to read a book about Darius.I would recommend this book for a lite afternoon read."
5,Very Good Read,"I had read Kathleen Nance's 2nd book, and enjoyed it so much I ordered this one. I enjoyed both and hope she keeps up the good writing. Wishes Come True was fun to read and a page turner."
2,Major Disappointment,With the reputation of Liane De Pougy I was expecting to read about the exciting and scandalous life of a notorious courtesan. Instead I was disappointed with reading about the mundane life of an arrogant old woman constantly complaining about her health and annoying love/hate relationships with practically everyone she was associated with. This book was definitely a waste of time!
2,Turning Self-Absorption in an Art Form,"Liane's life gave her all she needed to write a delicious and delightful book, had she but turned outward. Her self-absorption is amusing for a chapter, then becomes banal. The book made my 17-year-old daughter appear altogether gracious!"
1,My BORING Blue Notebooks...don't be fooled by the back cover,"Our entire book club of 12 wonderful women thought this book sounded like a great read, but NONE of us could make ourselves finish it (a first in 7 years of book club!). The back cover promises insite into Liane's exciting live, but we just get to hear abou her boring life as an over the hill sinner. Don't waste your time...we didn't! Unfortunately, we had already wasted our money :(- Lisa from Madison"
5,Could She Deny Her Growing Tendre For A Gentleman...,"...Who Clearly Was Not Who He Pretended To Be?Miranda Gannet was a poor relation and treated little better than a servant at Carlisle House, possessing neither funds nor fortune to escape the miserable existence forced upon her by the death of her parents years ago.An outcast herself, she could hardly remain immune to the sad plight of Lord Carlisle's new houseguest, an eccentric gentleman claiming to be the new Earl of Severn, whose own family belived him to be an imposter!To her surprise, Miranda discovered that a man with keen intelligence and strong carriage was hiding behind those ridiculous spectacles, odd ways and strange speech. She had no way of knowing what kind of secrets the earl was hiding. But she did know that she found him much too appealing for a man who was evidently quite skilled at deception..."
4,"delightful ""disguised"" Regency romance....","what a wonderfully unusual Regency. While we have seen several Regencies where the heroine is in disguise, this was the first I've read where it's the hero in disguise.I loved the hero, Anthony-the product of a well born mother, and a military father, who were cast out of the family for marrying for loveand they moved to India. The father commits suicide, and the family supposedly thinks the mother and child died in India as well. Fast forward 20+ years later, and the child, Anthony, comes back to England as he is the rightful Earl. His Uncle, who is the heroines ward but treats her like a servant, was about to claim the Earlship, and here is where the readers come in.I don't want to give away any more of the storyline, but the story is dramatic, funny, adventure filled and a mystery to boot. This is my first book by Miss Ward, but definitely not the last-recommended!4 stars!"
3,"Heavy overlap with ""London Warsaw New York""","This EP, released shortly after ""London Warsaw New York"", is a bit of a disappointment. Several songs are the same as the LWNY version and the remixes are almost indistinguishable from the originals. The saving graces are the four additional songs. I really like both ""Masquerade"" and ""Come to Heaven""; they are some of Basia's sassiest pop-jazz numbers. ""Give Me That"" is mediocre, and ""Forgive and Forget"" was a track from ""Time and Tide"" that only seemed to make it onto the European and Japanese releases."
5,PINK: FUNHOUSE TOUR-LIVE,ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE BEST CONCERT DVD'S I'VE EVER SEEN AND AM SO GLAD TO OWN! IF YOU'RE A PINK FAN...THIS IS A MUST TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION! EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A PINK FAN...YOU NEED TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION! I GIVE IT 100 STARS!
5,Mind Blowing...Like her song...Fing Perfect!,"LOVE Pink! And I was not disapointed with this STUNNING video, I LOVED every minute of it. Made me definately want to attend one of her concerts in real life when she comes! LOVED all her bandmates and dancers, just a visual feast for the eyes as well. LOVED Bohemian Rhapsody! Loved the behind the scenes footage...just an incredible video and worth every penny!!!"
2,Irritating,"I was expecting a crystal clear, high resolution recording on Blu Ray, like all the other live concerts I have purchased which make you feel like you're in the front row of the audience. Instead, the producers of this recording wanted you to feel like you were watching a drive-in movie on a snowy night through a frosty windshield while your car was moving. Pink's performance was exceptional, but why would anyone record it using modern high definition cameras and microphones, only to screw it up in editing and production? Grainy images, out of focus lens, and lighting halos are irritating."
4,"Great Pink, Bad DVD and Amazon Return","Love Pink's voice and writing, and this show, from what I could see of it, was fantastic.The trouble is that 30 minutes into it the DVD froze. I cleaned it several times. It's defective.Amazon's take on that? Sorry bud. You get 50% of your money back. Oh, no you don't, it's too days after 30 days. You get nada.I will grant it is my fault that I didn't get time to watch this for over a month, but a defective DVD is a DEFECTIVE DVD.For all the years I have been an Amazon Prime customer, youd think they'd allow a return on a defective DVD without charging their customer for it.I hope you get a DVD that works. Otherwise you'll pay double to get it from Amazon. I think I will buy it elsewhere now so if I get another defective copy I can actually return it and get my money back.Yay PINK. Boo Amazon."
2,Item was not as described,Customer satisfaction still in progress. Thought as it was listed and described that it was the actual dvd of Pink's Funhouse concert tour in Australia. But it wasn't. It was the cd with a few music videos. SO hopefully the seller has that and will exchange the item.
2,Concert is Great - DVD is bad!,"Everything was great with ordering the DVD (Amazon was even the only place that we could find it).While watching, towards the end the DVD skipped over several chapters and no matter what we tried we could not get to those chapters. We had ordered one for us and one for a friend so we tried the second one with the same result.We have not received replacements yet, but so far Amazon has been very responsive in handling the return.Will update when issue is finally resolved."
5,The Undisputed Queen of Rock,"P!NK performing live raises the bar for any Live actIt's Cher meets the StonesAlicia Moore (Pink) is One of the Most under-rated Singers!Vocally she can really sing, There is alot of soul and emotion in her voiceThis BR is One of the Best Concert BR Disc in my collectionthe PQ is Awesome! The Audio is Also Close 2 FlawlessThis disc could be used as a Tech Demo to Push the HD FormatThe Concert itself makes me wanna see P!NK LiveGreat Set List,Larn Poland (Director) & Roger Davies (Producer) Did a Great job filming the show!It's just a Over-All Killer Concert to viewIf you are a P!NK Fan or A Rock/Pop Fan It's A Must See 9.4/10"
5,Excellent!,"This is very simply an excellent concert disk. The show is amazing... very theatrical and entertaining. I have never seen a Pink concert before (live or disk) but was really impressed with this one. If you like concert DVDs, this is a great one. Even better in Bluray!"
5,Amazing musician! Amazing performance!,I love this video. Great performance. She's such a great performer live. Hands down this is a must own.
5,Brilliant; Pink and her band F...... ROCK!!!!,"what a masterpiece; the setlist, performance, and audio are superb on the bluray!only negative is the video editor is missing all of Mark Schulman's incredible drum fills.he butchered the video on Babe I'm Going to Leave You; one of the highlights of the set...what a moron; otherwise this performance is as good as it getsBUY IT!!!"
5,Terrific,"One of the best Album and CD ever. The dancing, costumes, (Pink's silk routine is breathtaking) lighting, music and meaningful lyrics are memorable. Pink's personality really shines. Her voice is incredible. Worth the money...you'll watch and listen over and over. Just love it.Very pleased with ease of ordering and free shipping. Satisfied with delivery time and packaging.Funhouse Tour: Live in Australia"
5,If you missed Pink's Concert Tour.....,LOVE this DVD of Pink's Funhouse Tour. Saw Pink in NYC at MSG in October 2009 and this DVD follows her concert exactly. You will feel as though you are watching her Live. The sound quality is exquisite and video is excellent. A Must Have!!
5,Pink DVD,"Wow. Even if your not a Pink fan, you can see this young lady is talented, driven, and very attractive, even to an old dude like me. Seriously, she can really sing, what a great voice. She has a lot of swagger, however she can be very tender also. Great physical shape I might add."
1,Lousy Customer service,"I love Pink but this seller was very slow! I didn't get the Dvd timely and when I finally played it 1 1/2 weeks after the delivery it would'nt play at all And the return warranty had expired. So no playable Pink Dvd, No recourse and I'm out my bucks"
4,A Pink fan you may become,I bought this as a gift but I watched it too. I saw this on cable before I bought it. Pink is amazing because ther's no lip-synching and a lot of acrobatics.I'm not a huge Pink fan but I have to admire the theatrics. I mean WOW this girl can sing while spinning around upside-down - that's impressive. I wonder if she can sing under water...
5,One of my favorite concert DVDs...,I'm am a recent P!nk fan and this DVD is great. It has several of my favorite songs and includes some of her more daring acrobatic feats. I think that even a non-P!nk advocate would be impressed.
5,Ya gotta love P!NK,"Great show by a great artist! I love the short bonus clip on how to ""Shred the GNAR""! Totally Hilarious!!"
1,Bad product does not last long,Lexmark z 55 is a very poor product it does not last long and trying to find out how to replace the product even with a warrenty stinks.. I am now without a printer I will never buy a lexmark again this is my third one in less the several years other people I talk to have their printers for years but they are not lexmark models. I need help with a refund and cannot even find that much.. Paid over $80.00 for a piece of junk I would not recomment this lexmark z55 to anyone.. Sorry I ever bought one to begin with.
5,Amazing!,"This is a quality item! You're looking at a horn made of brass with a heavy rubber bulb that is the quality and thickness of tire rubber. Perfect for a 1910s/20s car. I use this horn as an accessory piece for a 1920s-style silent clown costume. The circular tube has a brass tie near the bell which allowed me to slip it onto a belt around my waist and it can't fall off. The sound from this horn is a very loud, low, guttural honk, just like the sound Harpo Marx's taxi horn cane used to make. It definitely creates a stir, people jump and take notice!"
2,Not quite what I expected.,"The horn finish seems to be okay. The problem I have with it is the sound. It only makes one sound and not the dual sound these horns usually make. I think it may be the non-replaceable reed. I haven't had a chance to work on it yet but will do so later. If you only expect one sound you will not be disappointed, but if you expect dual sound like the horns on the cabs in India, you will be disappointed."
1,"Bulb Taxi Horn, Circular","The horn was defective. Did not properly honk. Returned for refund. Hesitate to re-order, being afraid the next one would be bad, also. Best to purchase at music store where one can try it out before buying."
4,The End of the Trail...,"""Tucket's Home"" is the last book in the Francis Tucket series. Although there is some action, it is mostly about tying up loose ends and getting to the final destination.As in the other books, Gary Paulsen has done an excellent job of making it crystal clear that the western journey wasn't easy. If it wasn't disease and starvation trying to get the better of you, there were the elements, and worse, the kinds of wild men that gravitate to areas were the law isn't present.This is a short quick read and good ending to the series. I highly recommend these kid-parent-and-teacher approved books.a Pam T mini-review(booksforkids-reviews)"
4,Tuckets Home Is Great,Tuckets Home is a great book to read.Gary Paulsen really does a good job writing the series.In Tuckets Home Tucket trails a journey.He meets Jason Grimes on his way north.Also he meets a group of men that cook everynight.Tucket really likes them.Later the decide to go down stream on rafts.Tucket keeps going north though.He keeps on going and he finds some people.I encourage you to read it. It is a great book!!!!!
4,Only for the enthusiast,"For those of you collecting Swervedriver's singles, this is perhaps their least accessible set of B-sides. ""Good Ships"" is a slow, druggy retake of ""Wrong Treats""... ""Hate Yr Kind"" is mostly forgettable. ""Stimulini"" is the best song on here. For the hardcore fan only."
5,Two Boys Coming of Age,"This is a wonderful documentary that follows the lives of two boys, Chris and Cody, growing up in Eastern Kentucky from ages 15-18. Each boy has significant family problems to deal with. Chris's father is unemployed and a severe alcoholic. Cody is an orphan being raised by his step-grandmother. They go to an alternative private school, which is a last resort for troubled kids. They are trying hard, and you can't help hoping they'll beat the odds. Highly recommended."
2,to much work,the screen protector was to hard to keep clean and hard to get bubbles out . and after washing it to reuse same problem
3,iPhone 5 screen protector,I wanted a screen protector that was not so shiny. It makes it hard to see some things sometimes. I really wish they would state clearly if it’s shiny or matte.
3,Clear screen protection,"Very clear, and fairly easy to put on. It feels just like the glass of the phone, so it's really not noticeable. My only complaint is that it isn't as tight fitting as other screen protectors on the market, but this does give you more margin for error when putting it on."
2,short attention span theatre,"I remember really liking ""Joseph Andrews"", another famous novel by this author.I remember it being funny. I just couldn't get into this one. It takes a while to get going. The basic plot is that Tom is a foundling, in love with a wealthier girl, but Tom is forced to leave his home. After many complications, including Tom's somewhat ""innocent"" infidelities, you can guess what happens. It's sort of a male version of a Jane Austen novel, with more travel involved, and more comedy. Maybe my attention span is shrinking."
2,Not that great of a kit,"The folder that you put the quarters into only shows one side of the quarters. For these new quarters, I wanted to be able to see both sides of the quarters. Whitman's other binder is much better."
1,Bugs!,"Was nice for a short while... I had to throw this out because of small black bugs that kept appearing in the hamper. Turns out they were feeding on the wicker. I was so discussed, as this was for my daughters nursery."
5,Outstanding Performance,"Poco is one of my favourite bands.I owe every album.Since I live in The Netherlands,it has allways been impossible te actueel see or feel a concert.This dvd makes it up.And how!The music is state of the Art and I really got chickenskinned when I heard Paul play on his beautiful Gretsch.Rusty on pedal is amazing and a sight to see.Even a Hammond B3 was showcased.I hope that one of the guys(Poco)will drop me an e-mail.If you love Poco,get this one.My favourite song,Rose of Cimarron,got me almost crying.The sound is great,and while the band does not give a entertainment,they just do what they,re good at.Play music and making me happy.Thanx guys."
3,puhleeze,"I know we're not supposed to do this ...but...this cd is $2.97 here at Amazon, $19 at Starbucks...first, the $5.00 cup of coffee (and we smile and say 'thank you')...now this!!?? By the way the cd is interesting and surprisingly good...I bought mine from Amazon..."
2,What rarities?,"The Stones (or their record company) need some counseling. Do they want to issue true rarities? Here are some suggestions:Think Im going madClaudine (Emotional rescue outtake)Drift awayCriss-cross man (Goat`s outtake)Living in a harder loveFiji Gin (Some girls outtake)Yellow cabLonely at the top (Stones version, not solo Jagger)Travellin man (Exile outtake)The list goes on and on. When are they going to open the vaults? To call this collection Rarities is an insult. For Abkco, some suggestions too that could make us Stones fans very happy:Looking tiredSatisfaction (early version, with harp)Blood red and wineCo**k sucker bluesGold painted nailsHighway child (extraordinary Let it bleed outtake)Jumpin Jack Flash (TV version)Record companies should invest a little time, do research and deliver true lost gems."
1,I DONT GET IT,"I LIKE MAYBE TWO SONGS FROM THE STONES I DONT GET THEIR POPULARITY, I WANTED TO RATE IT 0 STARS SORRY!!!!!"
1,Waste,"This album is a disgrace. The Stones are obviously trying to fill some contractual obligation (it was also a contractual obligation that led the Stones to record and release the rarity ""Co**sucker Blues"" which, ironically, is left off this album).By the way, Bill Wyman has been airbrushed out of the picture used for the album's cover. That's loyalty for you.Save the cash that you plan to spend on this album and give it to a Hurricane Katrina charity."
1,ANOTHER RIP-OFF,"Early in 2005, there were a few Stones releases on the schedule that never saw the light of day. Stones freaks like myself salivated over the prospect of hearing these multi-disc collections, which promised outtakes and unreleased recordings and live songs from the late 1960s, and early 1970s. Instead we got this knock-off Christmas release that amounted to nothing more than theft. I bought 'Rarities' as soon as it came out (for full price). I had already bought 'Sucking In The Seventies'. Given the crossover of tracks, I soon felt like a TOTAL sucker. As for airbrushing out Bill Wyman-- this reminds me of the recent double-disc compilation which featured a thick booklet but no space for Mick Taylor. I love the Stones but I hate how they rip off their fans. And what's with the Stalin-like rewriting of history?"
3,Rare to most listeners but not collectors,"Well I look at it this way, I have 65 rolling stones releases, of that are albums, singles and foreign items, not alot to a collector but I do know stones tunes by now, and I can say that these are not common for people to find in the general public.The few actually rare songs are worth my buy, and for the other stuff that some are only mp3 format, this will be nice because of the remastered sound. All in all this one is worth my $13.00 and maybe these guys can pump out part 2, part 3 or even part 4 soon...then I will know they are treating their fans the best.For those who like the Rolling Stones but are unsure about this album, I would say ""buy the basics first"" then come back to this kinda stuff after you get that ""want"" to hear more.Either way, it's the Rolling Stones, so button your lip baby...(Mixed Emotions)"
2,Not so rare,"Well I agree with most reviewers....most of this stuff is readly available. There three solid gems, the live let it rock being one of them! So yes I will buy this...but really this was a shoddy attempt at xmas buyers! I mean where are all the b-sides like ""So Young"" ""I'm gonna drive"" ""Jump on top of me"" those three songs alone would be worth it....they should have put those on Voodoo lounge. Come on Mick and Co...give us a proper rarities and b-sides CD."
2,Live With Me?,"Just a quick note-Chris Bushman's reviews are always welcome-I use them to help decide song running order and which CD's get burned with extra tracks from the tunes contained on other CD's from the same session (such as ""Tops"" and ""Waiting On A Friend"" from ""Tatoo You"" get re-burned onto a CD with the rest of the ""Goats' Head Soup"" album to make it a more complete listening experience).Anyway, the live version of ""Live With Me"" on this CD is the same version that appeared on the ""Wild Horses"" single. So it seems that this is from the same sessions as yeilded the ""Stripped"" live album (the other 3 tracks on that CD single are all from the ""Stripped"" live dates). So i'm not sure that this really is the same version that was contained as a B-side to a ""Voodoo Lounge""-era single.."
3,Very little that is rare,"Unless you are obsessed with collecting RS material, or have never heard these tunes before, you could probably pass on this one. There is very little that is rare here, and in some cases (e.g., Wild Horses) has already been released. Too bad, because the Stones would presumably have some gems in the vaults. For what its worth, the beginning of Tumbling Dice on this CD is fun (complete with hand-clapping and acoustic guitars), and the harmonies on Through the Lonely Nights are vintage Stones, a la Exile on Main Street. The rest is fine, but you could live a happy life without it and save a few bucks in the process."
2,"""Here Comes Your Nineteenth Nervous Re-release""","""Fancy Man Blues,"" the original B-side to ""Mixed Emotions"" sounds like an outtake from ""Exile on Main St,"" which is probably the ultimate compliment you can give a ""single."" But the rest? EEeeehhhhhhh.........I cannot conceive of the quantity of narcotics it'd be necessary to ingest to listen to ""Miss You"" for much more than a minute. The timing of ""Bigger Bang"" coupled with the timing of the release of this CD - much like the release of ""Metamorphosis"" in tandem with whatever-that-early-seventies-""greatest hits"" thing back in 1975 (""Made In The Shade"") - just proves that it has...all...already...been...done. I mean, COME ON, Guys! Take the hint that Stu's death and Bill's defection should have given you and retire gracefully! PLEASE don't pull a ""Kurt Cobain"" and have Charlie die onstage just to get attention!"
4,Pump it Up,"Let's rock, a good lick of the Stone's and their history,some great material can be heard on this one, get it, andenjoy it."
2,"Review for 12"" dance single collectors: So few Stones 12"" versions on CD...still!","There were only a handful of Rolling Stones songs that managed to make their way into the 12"" era of the late 70s and 80s, and while they are basically all on this mish-mosh of rareties, there's only ONE full length 12"". ""Mixed Emotions"" is it's full 6:10 12"" version. As other reviewers have stated, ""Miss You"" loses a minute. But also, The NY mix of ""Harlem Shuffle"" has been edited down by about 40 seconds! Not to mention, the original vinyl 12"" version of the song had two different mixes, the flip side being a UK 12"" mix. It would have been like striking gold to find that on here, too instead of all these live tracks (who cares?), as well as the FULL LENGTH 12"" versions of the other tracks. Otherwise, why BOTHER putting the stuff onto CD at last, probably the only time any attempt will ever be made to preserve these remix rareties???"
2,Sham -with a few essentials,"This is a very stupid compilation with two essentials and a few tidbits. The 1971 live version of ""Let it Rock"" is fabulous, and the 1974 b-side ""Through the Lonely Nights"" features some great Mick Taylor guitar playing. I always liked the ""Steel Wheels"" b-side ""Fancy Man Blues."" But do we really need live versions of ""Thru and Thru,"" Mannish Boy (rare? it's the version from ""Love You Live"") ""Tumbling Dice"" and ""Wild Horses"" (rare? it's the same version from ""Stripped"") I wanted two of these cuts so I bought this cd (hence a two star rating) But the idiots who complied this cd were lazy and stupid in their selections."
3,J.P. Hit's nail on the head,"Gotta agree with JP Ryan from Mass. The Stones had a great chance to affirm thier status as music pioneers after their excellent 'Bigger Bang' release and then following up with a ""rarities"" album. This had the chance to be a great one-two punch but the Stones fell short. Why do the Stones put 'live' versions on this album when they can be found on one of their million live releases already? If there must be another live release save the Stripped outtakes and release Stripped 2. As a Stones fan, I would have been much happier if this had been a B-sides/soundtrack releases only CD. Who's advising the Stones on song choices anyway,the London School of Economics? Hey Kieth, get off your ass and get involved in these projects it would probably help."
1,Rarities?!,"What a rip off! I love the Stones, but I can't believe they have the balls to call tracks from ""Love You Live,"" ""No Security,"" ""Stripped"" and ""Sucking In The 70's"" rarities. Of course the back cover doesn't tell you the source and year of the recordings, you get to find out when you get open it up, like I did."
4,The Storm..Eye of the Storm,"I liked it. Anything w/ Gregg Rolie & Ross Valorie has to be good, I'm a huge fan of early Journey (before Steve Perry)& I wish they could cut more songs of the same style!!!"
5,rockers lady,I had the pleasure of meeting the band back in the 90's when their first CD The Storm was released after a concert in California. Their second and final CD (sad to have to write this is the last CD) continues where the first one left off. To bad it has to end....
5,nice deal,"good quality, and the price is nice. The book is the textbook of one of my classies this semester, and I really enjoy the deal."
5,Nice Pegs,These metal pegs are top quality. Very nice! We used them to replace the rather lame plastic pegs that came with a cribbage board.
1,Cribbage Pegs and Seeing Double,At first glance these cribbage pegs look exquisite. They certainly are durable and they feel right. The problem with them is they look too much alike. I cannot tell the gold pins from the silver pins whether I'm indoors or outdoors. However the problem can be solved with a little fingernail polish. But then who wants tacky looking cribbage pins when you must pay a quality price.
2,Shiny,"They are shiny, metal and come with a sweet bag. However, they don't fit in my cribbage board. These pegs are really thick. I kicked them around for several months, then finally threw them away."
2,Cribbage Pegs,"Having brass cribbage pegs instead of plastic ones to use with our board was an appealing idea. However, these particular pegs are too large to really fit into the holes of our conventional boards. Disappointed."
3,Okay product: Slightly Disappointed,"The cribbage pegs are nicely sized and sturdy. However, I am slightly disappointed by the artificial, almost cheap looking finish on them; the pegs have a fake shiny, almost too metallic finish, which makes them less classy."
1,Did I just put butter on my face?,I tried a bit of this after getting it for my mom for Christmas. It's so thick and oily feeling that it felt like I just smeared butter on my face. Its smell kind of resembles feet or dirty socks. I think I'm going to send it back and get her some Mary Kay to use instead.
5,This really IS something!!,"Techno is alive and well. The title track ""something"" deserves all of the radio and club play is has received and is the best song on the disc. But Evi's sultry voice does not stop there. Similarly great, uptempo songs that deserve airtime include ""blue"", ""alone"", ""searching"", ""follow"", ""pray"", ""you"", and ""heaven"". ""Cloud surfers"" is an excellent instrumental. I initially just bought this CD to record ""something"" onto another disc with other artists. But after listening to the entire CD, I can't stop myself after that one song."
2,Blah....,"I bought this cd with somewhat high hopes because of all of the good reviews. But what I got was not too thrilling. You can have a ""sound"" but when that ""Sound"" is way overused and repetitive it loses it's merit. Lasgo, unfortunately, are not very creative it seems. Some reviewer dared to compare them toAce Of Base...please do not compare Lasgo to that very talented Swedish group! Don't waste your money on this cd. I'm VERY lenient on techno music but this is one that i would definitely like to resell."
3,Good Vocals,"This is a good album for those fans of sylver, and dj encore, and 4 strings. The vocals are really strong, and the arrangements are smooth. Lasgo's style twists house until it almost becomes trance. The songs that are more trance aresomethingaloneprayI wonderIt is a good album for fans of trance or house, but it can't be considered any more one than the other. Lasgo's Some things is progressive with a depressed tone."
3,Some Things,"It's silly, it's irritating, it's obnoxiously addictive...yep sounds like typical dance music. Lasgo's debut ""Some Things"" doesn't really offer any surprises- there aren't many to dig up with their batch of trance/electro-pop. As to be expected, the majority of the album plays off the same formula and winds up being one carbon copy after the next, but kick-off single ""Something"" is a sure-fire club anthem."
3,I hope their 2nd album is better,"This album is mediocre and I feel it could have been better but I guess it's alright for a debut. The songs seem to sound similar with a ballad here and there such as Cry and Searching. Standout tracks are Don't Belong 2 U Follow You and Cloud Surfers. They have a new single out called Surrender and they filmed a video for it in Berlin, Germany."
1,are you kidding me?,"Incredibly cheesy. Her voice is flat, with no pleasant enhancement or overdubbing. Nice for a song or two but then it's just boring. The music is simplistic. Not simple; simplistic. Drum machine, her voice and one or two synth tracks. That's it. Really thin. While some musicians might make an amazing work out of this scaled-back style, here it is incredibly boring. And the singing is just too cheesy. Really disappointing."
1,Not a good fit.,"I really love the look of this case, and the front half of it fits nicely, but the back half of the case keeps falling off which is very frustrating, because you can't clip the phone to you. I also think the clip is too thick, and makes your phone more bulky."
3,its ok,It doesn't cover the screen so there is no protection for that. It also will not fit if you have purchased the larger battery for your phone. so I just have the front part of this cover on my phone. It looks great and if it fit with my bigger battery I'd like it more.
4,Serves its purpose,"I think this would work better with a ""money"" type clip. However, since Verizon doesn't carry anything like this in clear, this works."
2,"Works... halfway, literally.","I bought this for my friend. He put on the front piece, it fit fine and he thought it was great. Then he put on the back cover... big mistake. It bent the back half of his phone backwards. Now, he only uses the front piece."
1,Bad ordering,I place an order for the CU720 LG Shine but was shipped the screen cover for LG VX8500 Chocolate and was charged for shipping when it came to me in a 1st class envelop with one USPS .40+ cent stamp.
2,Front Piece Fits,The shipping was quick. Very satisifed with that. The front part of the cover fit my phone perfectly for a while then kept popping off- the back - not at all.It was half useful for about a week...
2,It doesn't fit all the chocolate phones!!,"I had bought 2 cases to go on my chocolate phone, I got a new one now but when I went to pass off the cases it didn't fit a friends chocolate phone."
1,Cheap case,Don't bother getting this. It doesn't fit on the Chocolate correctly. It's a waste. I would have sent it back but I didn't want to waste the postage.I just tossed it!
3,As good as price.,"This case is looking good and traslucent.But, it's tight a little. I think this is not perfect case cover for chocolate phone.Just worth for its price. That's all."
3,Informative but sad,"Allthough the book is quite informative i had some trouble understanding some points in regards to Yusuf Ali. The author was not clear enough, in some parts i didnt know whether he was serious or sarcastic in remarks made.I must admit though it was dissapointing learning about Yusuf Ali as such a man who did such a great Job turns out below your expectations.In the end you are left feeling sorry for the Man, The translator of the Koran to English is abodoned by All those who are family.You are left with a sense of guilt as you cannot , or find in yourself to judge Yusuf Ali. A few questions stay un answered... Was he really a great man? Was there justice in the ending of such a man who did such a great job?"
5,heartfelt singing,"There are singers who sing for the sake of showing their range and their vocal virtuosity, while another group of singers who may not be vocally equipped opt for the musical storytelling route. Rondi Charleston possesses the range necessary to dazzle and the ability to make us pay attention to the lyrics. And she can tell a story through the songs she used to re-introduce the listeners to a familiar song's narrative with her tonally rich instrument. In her version of ""Time After Time"" and ""Where Do You Start?"", there is an urgency in her voice that makes the songs highly engaging. In ""So In Love"" she manages to sound like someone deeply in love and for the first time that it is almost heartbreaking to hear -- both for the lyrical beauty and the fragility that she imbued the song.Do yourself a favor and get ""Love Letters"" and enjoy the supreme artistry of an artist certainly deserving wider recognition."
2,I keep having to buy more accessories! GRR!,"This seems like a nifty cool little lightweight drive... the price is great for a reason though. The drive comes with nothing but a 6 pin to 6 pin firewire cable, and an install CD.That meant I had to go back out and buy a 6 pin to 4 pin cable for another $29.99 so that i could plug it into my laptop. So I finally find one locally and go get one.THEN, it turns out that the drive is no longer bus-powered when it's plugged into a 4-pin port, like the one on my laptop... so now I'm expected to buy yet another $29.99 for an 'optional' AC Adapter so I can finally try using this drive. I ordered from Amazon so I could get the drive right away, in 2 days expedited shipping... so I got it, and now 3 days later I'm still having to buy more stuff to find out if the drive even works.If these things are necessary to operate the equipment, they need to either include the accessories, or make it CLEAR that you have to buy these things before you use the drive.NOT COOL."
1,You've got to be kidding,I love DVD RAM. It is a superior recording device. DVD RAM makes the VCR antiquated. But the price on this is out of range by more than a little. ...
3,Could be great,"This tool works great and is sturdy, however the handle is held on by a single small screw that comes loose constantly. I have replaced the screw with a larger one and that has helped greatly. The big handle is a great idea however the plastic is the weak link here. Mine broke in half at the molding mark on top.I went on line and contacted Fiskars and was rewarded with a free new handle. I feel the metal portion of the shovel is very stout, but I worry I will be contacting Fiskars again for a new handle. We will see. I will enjoy the tool while it works like a champ for now. I don't baby my tools, but feel it has this weak link. It could be great."
2,Broke right in half,"I had this item a little under a year, stored it in the garage. It has gotten a lot of use and I really liked it until it the spade portion broke right in half while spading up some grass. I went back to where I bought it and they said they could do nothing and deal directly with the manufacturing. They said they received my request for help but have not contacted me and now it is over a week later."
3,"Heavy, bulletproof, and a little silly","This spade has a tough finish which will likely prevent rust for a very long time even if left outside, the shaft is sturdy steel with an oval cross section, and as described, the orange handle is oversized. If you have the physique of Shrek, and want a tool to chip through a thick layer of winter ice, this spade should do the job. If you want a handy tool for gardening, it's unnecessarily heavy, a bit clumsy, and well, a bit silly too. The diameter of the handle is so large that it's not easy to close your fingers around (and my hands are rather large.) Though my tastes have been shaped by the years of farm work as a kid, I much prefer a round cross section wooden shaft with a curve at the attachment point, to the larger oval cross section of this Fiskars design. In addition the steel will feel very cold in cold weather. The good news is this spade will probably last forever -- the bad news is you'll probably wish it didn't."
4,Great Edging Shovel,"I bought this for edging the lawn. Its performs great, is sturdy and a perfect size for the job. I've used it to chop a few roots when leveling pavers and it was great at that as well. As others have said the handle seems to be the weak link, I can already see some whitish pressure strains forming, but we will see."
3,Fiskars Garden Spade,"This product is designed for men to use. It is a pitty they do not make a lighter, smaller version for women. I have found it sturdy but too heavy and cumbersome to use for long periods of time. It always amazes me how little manufacturers think of women when they design products and in the case of gardening tools, women are often active users of such tools so the oversight is all the more egregious."
3,"Sweet, unassuming lo-fi pop","The Best Friends Group is a collaboration of members of Portland, OR's Kissing Book; Melbourne, AU's The Lucksmiths, and various other PNW indie pop luminaries. Mark Monnone of the Lucksmiths contributes vocals on ""Sweet Little Ray,"" while Drew Kaffer revisits a Kissing Book classic on ""Another Sad City"". Uncomplicated production values remind you that simplicity is beauty. Good for fans of the aforementioned bands, or for anyone wanting to expand their collection of indie pop."
3,folders to organize papers,not bad for the price. Grandson uses for college to organize files at home. would buy again. recommend for others.
2,Pop Psychology and Freud,"The book came highly recommended, but I thought it was lousy. Most of the ideas he puts across are not based in science. Too much 1950's Freudian psychobabble. However, I still give it 2 stars for the same reason others gave it high marks - a lot of the men's issues and struggles are honestly expressed. I just don't agree with his explanations and solutions. The chapters are a jumble of ideas and hard to follow. You ask yourself, at the end of a chapter, ""What was the point?""It could be a good book, if it was re-written with a logical presentation of ideas, and more accurate science including some of the discoveries on hormones and brain development. In summary, some small nuggets of valid points lost in a sea of circular language and bad logic."
2,Better off buying Beta vcr tapes---- totally useless,"This book, albeit comical at times, was a total waste of my time and money, not a very good read, pretty much all the same jokes you hear as you are preparing to be wed, yada, yada, yada.Save your cash for the expensive reception dinner."
2,"Funny, but under this guise should provide actual guidance","A good helping of humor is good for potential grooms, but most of us need more substantial info along with it. This book does provide a few good laughs (like the description of a diamond as an ""overdigested lump of coal -- the kidney stone of earth's urinary tract),"" but if you are looking for actual guidance - which you most likely will need - look elsewhere in the handful of books for grooms."
5,HAVEN'T LAUGHED THIS HARD IN YEARS!!,I received this book as a gift and expected to be bored senseless with useless bits of tired advice. I was thrilled to be wrong. This book was both FUNNY and ENLIGHTENING. I highly reccommend this book to all marrying men. Everyone needs to laugh before the big day and this book delivers.
1,Quickly being returned,"I bought this book for my fiance hoping he could have a little fun with it. We've decided to return it pretty quickly -- while it starts our funny enough -- it quickly denegrates into non-funny jokes that indicate that there is NOTHING positive about getting married at all (meeting her parents -- no matter what her mother does means she's coming on the the groom). I expected a book of humor with some practical advice on how to get through it -- I found some humor, but nothing worth keeping."
4,"Hilarious commentary on weddings, marriage, and people.","The authors' sitcom-writing experience shows in this nonstop blizzard of jokes about weddings, marriage, and relationships. A cross between David Letterman and Mad Magazine. Though targeted at guys, will appeal to anyone. There's poignancy and brutal honesty beneath the thick blanket of funny."
1,This book is absolutely useless!,"Not only did this book not impress me but my fiancee thought it was terrible as well. Most of the authors' attempts at humor are unsuccessful, and most importantly, this book contains little valuable information for anyone who actually wants information on how to get smoothly through the engagement and wedding process. If you want a helpful manual save your money! This is not it."
2,It's ok,"If you are looking for a book that will help you on the afternoon electrical specific portion of the FE (or EIT) don't get this book. it helps alot with the morning session and gives alot of good ideas on being prepared and ready for the exam in general, but not alot on the afternoon portion"
2,Not the best,"This book features a lot of exercises, but unless you are extremely rusty or have little knowledge in general principles I wouldn't recommend this book. The exercises are incredibly basic, and the book is riddled with errors (I lost count after the second chapter). I'd recommend another book."
1,FE prep using this textbook,I find this textbook is not helpful in terms of completness for preparing for the Electrical Fundamental Engineering in the afternoon section.Don't rely on this text if you want to pass the FE for the Electrical Engineering.This review is after one month of writing it.
4,Helpful,Alot of useless crap but it is still very helpful. I would recommend it to everyone to give it a try.
3,I passed!,"I passed the FE, and that's all that matters. Although I probably didn't need this to do it, considering all the review sessions my university held. I'm sure it helped a little though."
5,best chocolate ever,"I have had so many difference chocolates, high end to low end, and Gorant's Mill Creek Asst is one of the best I have ever had. Creamy, different centers you don't find in other boxed chocolates. The fruit fillings are fantastic.If you want a great gift for anyone, and they love chocolate, this is the box for you!"
5,Simply Amazing,"This video is simply amazing. It is a must see for every pediatric cancer caregiver and parent. The video captures the parent and patient prospective as well as gives an important lesson in ""living in between"" cancer and treatment. It gives us wonderful examples of all that is possible while living with and battling disease...it shows indeed ""The Art of the Possible""!"
1,Poor Hose Design,"The hose / barrel interface is so poorly designed it WILL leak and what good is a water barrel that won't hold water? The indentation where the hose is attached makes it impossible to get a screw driver on a clamp to try a fix it without taking the water out and turning the barrel upside down. The hose they give you is so ridged that using it has the effect of ripping it off the little, short pipe. I'm going to have to fix this.My fisrt attempt will create a new hose system on the existing exit pipe using a short, extremely flexible piece of hose to attach to the barrel that will not streess the connection when it used.If that doesn't work I'll try revising their little interface connection or plugging it and making a new one.Don't buy this product."
3,Broad strokes,"I own both the ""Special Colour Edition"" as well as the previous release of the book. My mistake was probably to expect the content itself to be refreshed, which in itself is pretty timeless. The fresh colour photographs and hard-cover makes the book a much better gift to rifle enthusiasts than the previous low-cost version.Still a good buy and must have for any serious fire-arms collector or enthusiast. Don't expect expert advise on any of the specific disciplines such as bench-resting, clay-pigeon shooting or silhouet shooting though. This is a general overview of the rifle and how to use it."
5,An excellent reference,The Art of the Rifle by Jeff Cooper is a very good reference on practical rifle handling and marksmanship. I highly recommend this book. The chapter on the use of the sling made this book worth the (high) purchase price for me.
2,Not Terribly Impressed,"I grew up shooting, took a 20 year hiatus, and then came back to it. Looking to improve my rifle shooting skills, I figured this ""authoritative"" work would be full of useful tips. It is not. Most of what is in this book is common sense. And if you spend anytime at all shooting, you'll figure it out on your own. It's a fine read but don't expect to get much out of it but ""steady your rifle"". Frankly, I feel like I wasted my money."
4,Raw and Real,"Classic rebel album from Declan Hunt and the lads, the perfect soundtrack to your next St. Patty's drinkfest. A little rough around the edges but performed with such passion and drive that after one listen and you'll be ready to storm something."
5,best for my height,Especially like the light weight and stable design with the fold down seat. When I lift the fold down seat the rollachair becomes thin and easy to place in the car/
1,No university/college should use this......,"I had to use this book for an online course while earning my bachelor's degree. This book was horrible. This group of 3 authors did not do a good job. The ideas and points did not run smoothly together from one point to another. It seems like the 3 authors did not work very close together to make sure their ideas connected and related directly with each other's ideas. It was as if the authors went from talking about point A, skipping all the way to point F, then going to point C, then back to point F, etc. etc. Their ideas did not flow in an understandable sequence. I also agree about the examples. The examples were no help and they were not thorough examples of material that you would run into the real-world. The examples needed much more details in them."
2,Huge waste of money,Horngren makes a notoriously dry subject even worse. It is filled with long winded verse and practically devoid of dynamic examples. Accounting is something that 'works' and can be worked out. It's best learned when applied to real world situations...this book aims to have you memorize boring definitions and then support those definitions with scarce examples. Even our professor said he's been lobbying to get this book out of my school's curriculum...too bad that didn't happen BEFORE I came along.
3,NOT ONE OF HER BEST,"Gloria Loring is a remarkably talented songstress, and over the years has brought us many memorable albums, most notably ""Full Moon and No Hesitation,"" and ""Is There Anybody Out There."" This collection of requests solicited from fans of her web-site and/or e-mail is full of those songs you would expect Jane Olivor or Linda Eder to do in a smoky coffee house. Gloria sings her heart out, particularly on ""Quiet, Please, There's a Lady on Stage,"" a song written about one of Judy Garland's last stage appearances. Starting out softly and quietly, the tune becomes a Broadway-type showstopper, up in tempo and such. It only works because Gloria's a pro. Her version of Kenny Loggins' ""Cody's Song"" is well done. In fact, they all pass competency and delivery. However, the production values are sparse and there are times when Gloria sounds tired or uninvolved. I'm a staunch Loring fan but I was disappointed in this set."
3,One Big Problem...,"The DVD cover should have Abigail and her husband John Adams on the front. But instead it has Abigail and HER SON JOHN ""QUINCY"" ADAMS on the front. What knucklehead approved this?"
2,A bad cover,"Though I plan to watch the video later, but clearly the photo shows John Quincy Adams, the 6th president, and not his father, John Adams, the 2nd president.Did somebody do their homework?"
2,Wrong John,"It would be helpful if the picture on the cover had the correct John. Abigail is fine, but the John with her is not John Adams her husband, but John Quincy Adams her son."
3,Very Informative,"This was a very informative CD. We had recently visited this part of the Untied States and had also watched the HBO mini series 'John Adams"" This just expands on that"
4,BALL ACCESS-GLOBAL AND1,"This mixtape was actually very entertaining all though it was a bit short. You get to see the And 1 crew in different countries doing there thing, mostly open runs against different international regions and a lot of sick moves and high flying dunks. What's original about this tape is the fact that you get to see that AND 1 is a international Phenomenon, not just know by us in North America. I would recommend this DVD to all who are fan's of AND1, there is some dunks/moves that I have never seen before-one word AYYYYYOOOOOOO!!"
1,Navajo Trader,"Gladwell Richardson, a.k.a. Maurice Kildare, was perhaps the most prolific writer for western history magazines from the 1950s through the 1970s. Unfortunately, his legacy is tainted. The articles he wrote, though based in fact, are heavily fictionalized. He published a great deal of folklore and fabrications and passed them off as facts. He wrote many memoirs of his childhood, but they conflicted with each other. At different times he claimed to have grown up simultaneously in Oklahoma and Arizona. When called on this by a complaining reader to Real West magazine, he claimed to have grown up in both places. This memoir, and anything else he wrote, should not be relied on as history. Gladwell Richardson was a story teller, not a historian, and his articles should never have been published in magazines like True West and Real West, because much of what he wrote was neither true nor real. John Boessenecker"
3,Fair enough equipment to keep your heart rate up,"I work out regularly and I hate just sitting in front of the TV. I wanted something that I could use without being on the ground or doing something that makes you lose focus on the television like running in place.It's fair. You tend to shift around. I got bored with it time and again but it's pretty good at helping you engage your abs.It's great for my 50 year old mother who rarely works out. To avoid shifting, she places a chair in front of her and holds onto it.Fair price, fair equipment. Nice to have around but not as a main source of exercise."
4,I've kept a copy in my shooting pouch for years.,"_This is a nicely done little pocket guide that covers everything you need to know to get started in muzzleloading. It really will fit in your shirt pocket or shooting bag._This guide covers everything from selecting a muzzleloading rifle or pistol, how to build a kit gun, how to load, how to clean, basics of shooting and sighting in, and casting lead balls. There is a good glossary in the back covering most of the specialised technical terms. Both flintlock and percussion are covered. There are really well-done and useful black and white photos and line drawings on practically every other page._There are a few things that aren't covered in this guide however- the new in-line modern designs, muzzleloading shotguns, and cap-and-ball revolvers. Still, for the tradition muzzleloading rifle and pistol fan it is an excellent, practical how-to guide."

3,so so,The stories in this book are Ok but its nothing out of the ordinary. The book itself is gorgeous like all leather bound book it looks great in a shelf. The shipping was great got it on time and the book cam in one piece no scratches or dents.
2,Diary of a mad black women,"Be Careful... I was thinking i had order the MOVIE, But, I got the PLAY instead...It was horrible .... BUT, the MOVIE is wonderful...."
1,Buyer Beware!,"These are NOT movies!! They are live-action plays on video. It does not say this in the product description. I should have read the other reviews and I would have known this. But, I think that Amazon has an obligation to be more clear in their presentation of the product to the consumer. Amazon was, however, very accommodating when I called to complain and requested a return authorization."
1,Not as described,"This product is misleading. While I absolutely LOVE Tyler Perry's movies, these are not movies. They are video footage of love plays. The product description doesn't clearly state this. I am returning this for a refund."
1,wish i had had any results from taking this product,"No telling if it was working or not, still had totake anti inflammatories so it didn't do aswell as the XanGo juice did, however, it ismuch less expensive so I tho't I'd give it a try.Good service, good ship time."
4,great lights,I used these lights on my bowfishing boat. I like the fact that they are the same a 300wt halogens. I just wish that the shipping cost wasn't so much.
5,lasagna pan,"This is a fabulous heavy duty, great looking pan. I used it to make a large moussaka, which I served in the pan. Definitely an important addition to my cookware."
3,Suprised at the finish,"The pan is fine but the edge was not finished properly on one area, and is sharp enough to cut my fingers. I must be very careful or I'll tear my hand!"
5,Time Mist Fragrances - A Real Blast of Goodness!,"At New Birth Community Church, we have been using these Time Mist Spray Refills since 2006. Often members and visitors have remarked on how fresh our church smells. We have set the sprays to dispense every 45 minutes. For us the micro sprays have usually lasted about 1 1/2 months."
3,A decent first show,"The first UFC includes plenty of brutal excitement, and you should get it if you are a fan of this type of competetion. The matches are all quick, and most are one sided. Also, the referee does a horrible job. Solid commentary, although only Jim Brown gets invited back for 2. Plenty of classic moments, from Tuli's tooth, to Pat Smith in the leg lock, to the rather anti-climatic final."
5,A classic & must buy,"Equally entertaining for both the historic Shamrock-Gracie I fight and as a time capsule of the Gracie family, back when they were still a family."
4,Pretty Good,The first taste the US got of NHB combat. This UFC did a great job of getting 8 different Martial Arts stylists together in a pretty exciting tournament. The first fight between Teila Tuli and Gerald Gordeau set the pace to how this tounrnament is going to be.
4,Available new on UFCstore.com for $14.95,"A must buy for a mixed martial arts fan in order to see the changes in the sport since 1994. However, I would buy it new from the UFC for 15 bucks."
5,THE WAY IT SHOULD STILL BE !,"ALOT OF PEOPLE THINK GRACIE ISN""T A GREAT FIGHTER.WELL THE FIGHTERS TODAY CAN BARELY MAKE IT TROUGH TWO 5 MINUTE ROUNDS.THIS DVD SHOWS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE. NO TIME LIMITS,AND THE ONLY RULES WERE NO BITING OR EYE GOUGING. THERE WERE NO ROUNDS EITHER. SO IF YOU WANT TO SEEREAL MMA COMPETITION BY THIS DVD!"
3,gracie chokes out shamrock!,"royce gracie chokes out ken shamrock. and in the post fight interview ken whines "" I'm not used to that stuff"". ha! ha! ha! ha!"
2,Not very good,First off the broadcasters did not know that they were talking about. there was no john mccarthy as ref the royce gracie shamrock match was very boring. ufc 1 was not as good as i thought it would be
4,Worst Man Wins,"Hey Greverio, news flash GRACIE IS BORING, the crowd was booing because shamrock should have won, oh let's waqtch a guy put his opponent in a leg lock for 20 minutes, (yeay) oh and shamrock is still around today where is gracie. other then that this event is a pretty solid debut for ufc"
5,Are Vampires just exploitive?,"The grandfather's speech halfway through the movie reveals what this film is really about - watch for it.The acting is very good, the writing is very funny, and it's refreshing to see a movie shot somewhere other than Southern California-pretending-to-be-somewhere-else.And watch out for the Gypsies!"
3,"How About a Half-Dozen ""Roses"" Instead","This is a delightful reissue of a 1953 Mono LP of Cello Sonatas by the under-appreciated Leonard Rose and pianist Leonid Hambro. I love Leonard Rose and very much enjoy his Concerto recordings of the Dvorak Cello, Saint-Saens Cello No. 1, Lalo Cello, Tchiakovsky Variations on a Rococo theme, Bloch Schelomo, Faure Elegy and Brahms Double, all currently available in the Sony Essential Classics series, and the Schumann Cello, formerly available in the Bernstein Royal Edition series but now out of print. This CD is also terrific, but it is literally the same as the original LP. It logs in at a whopping 38:57! Sony, surely you could have given us a half-dozen Rose recordings instead of just the three featured here. That would have been worth getting excited over."
1,Not needed,"If rabbits are given the proper diet of vegetables and pellets, they don't need extra vitamins."
4,Glad to find,"For a month, XM radio counted down every charting song from the 40's to the present. Quite ambitious, and an incredible listen. I here this song I love, but didn't get the name. A week later I purchase this CD and ""Witchi Tai To"" is on the CD. Great luck for me. ""My Boy Lollipop,"" ""Black is Black,"" ""Tobacco Road"" - all great songs. Okay, Lollipop isn't a great song, but it's hilariously fun."
1,Cheap and cracked!,"Got it, set it up - even got the fish who were patiently waiting for their new home. Suddenly we hear dripping.. onto.. our.. expensive ...dining room set (for the record - we had the tank on a high counter, not on the table). Long story short we discovered the crack along one side. The fish died. Child freaked out about the fish dying. The end. Cheap product."
2,poor fish,frish shouldnt be in this small of a tank one goldfish is spouse to be in a 10 gallon tanks\
1,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in this book. Although she does give some good tips, they could all have fit into less than two pages. The rest of the book consisted of lists prizes she's won and famous people she's met. Boring!"
2,Poor editing,"The editor of this book either must have been in a hurry when working on this book or has no business in the field of literature. There are numerous grammatical structure errors and word misspellings, i.e. Bush [sic] Stadium should be Busch Stadium. In another paragraph a reference is made to bugs bunny [sic] then in the next sentence it is spelled correctly as Bugs Bunny. I see the book nothing more than a list of prizes that she won and how she won them."
3,An okay book,"This book is okay. It has some nice old photos. However, it lacks the detailed captions that would have put the photos and the cars pictured into context and explained how they illustrate the development of chief's cars. One sentence is information is really not enough. Also, as with anything by Wood and Sorenen, it is very heavy on left coast photos. There are very few East coast departments featured. Overall, it is a nice book that fits well in the Iconografix line."
5,Works Great,This if my firs time to own a pressure cooker. It's well constructed and performs as advertised.
2,Things have changed,"For years, the Outback Trading Company's oilskin dusters were the equal of Schaefer's, and were nearly as good as the Barbour equivalents -- at a quarter of the Barbour price.Regrettably, this is no longer true. The coat, which used to be cut from 12 oz. canvas, is now constructed with 10 oz. canvas. The stitching and tailoring display nothing like the craftsmanship they once did. One experiences a sense of flimsiness when handling the coat, as opposed to the stiff-as-a-doormat feel true oilskin should provide when it's new. It's just not the same high-quality garment it was until now.If you're lucky, you might find one of these coats from Outback's old stock. If you're unlucky, you'll get one of the newly manufactured ones, which are made -- can you guess? -- in China."
1,Health hazard,"Had to get rid of mine. Skin burned after coming in contact with the water repellent, and suffered severe respiratory irritation. Washed and washed and washed to try to get it off, no luck. Hardcore bad chemical.I'll get a bare fabric duster one of these days and a dang umbrella."
5,Fire and Ice review /5 stars,"I buy Fire and Ice for my daughter who has used it since her teens, I love the smell so I buy it for her online."
1,cheap cheap cheap,"I saw a you tube video on this perfume and how good it smelled. I usually wear very good perfumes but was looking for an easy everyday different smell. I could not find a bad review on this, everyone seemed to love it. It is supposed to be floral and clean smelling on some reviews. I know everyone has different body chemistry but the price was cheap enough so i gave it a shot. Keyword is cheap. To my nose that's exactly what it smells like, cheap and heavy. Like being trapped in an elevator with an older woman with teased out short hair and bright red lipstick and drawn on eyebrows, that's what the smell reminds me of. Since it is not returnable...right in the trash can. See if you can sample it somewhere first before purchasing. I'm sticking with my coach poppy flowers..light and feminine."
5,its as said best,love it and bought it fire and ice smells like nothing else and stays with u all day or nite loe it
5,made girlfriend happy,"she likes it. its her favorite perfume. she happy me happy. now they want nine more words, who's review is this?"
5,Love It!!!,"This watch is exactly what I had hoped. Dressy enough but still casual for every day wear. I LOVE Relic watches, and this did not let me down. The warranty is more than I could ever expect, and ordering/adding links is very easy."
3,"Maybe okay for grass only,...","...but did not work for me because the chain is not coated and thus caught on the deck, the flags, the gate...everything between my sliding glass door and the grass!"
4,Good product,"Has all the described features and holds my cards well. I thought the 240 slots were part of the plastic pages, but there were less there and then the last few are the side pocket ones. Decent binder but doesn't look as nice as in the pic. The brown leather one I bought was much nicer. Still great product and works good for holding your cards. The leather is sensitive to touch and gets marks in it easily, but the inside organization is great."
5,Perfect for Business Person On the Go,This case was perfect. It was brand new and had a lot of space for business cards. The sleeves make it easy to place and remove cards without them tearing. Very sturdy and compact book. It is the size of a notebook tablet. May be hard to fit in a purse but it can fit into a bag easily. Does the trick perfect.
5,Thank You...........,"Thank you Teresa for your insight, sensativity and your honesty. This book is a tool for everyone, victim, survivor, family and friends can all benefit from the insight and information provided. This books not only acknowledges the tremendous emotional and physical impact rape has on a woman but it reminds us of our capacities to endure and rise above.Thank you!!"
1,The beginning of the book traumatized me,"The beginning of the book is a transcript and in one part the author describes being raped twice. It was horrifying, but after starting, I couldn't put it down right away. Then I put it down and couldn't pick it back up for years. The story seriously disturbed me at a time that I couldn't handle any more trauma. Maybe that type of story helps some people relate or work through their issues, but I think it needs to come with a warning.I definitely wasn't ready to hear it and don't think it would ever be helpful to have to imagine her horror. So there's your warning. On the other hand, the back section of the book seemed helpful enough, but by the time I was able to pick the book up again, it had been a few years, and most of those questions were no longer relevant to me."
2,a stark confronting book,"Mabey for some but not for me, too confronting to be useful as a self help for carers or victims. Too descriptive - although I am not saying not honest - not to be too traumatic for victims to be of use."
3,Is What It Says,"This is a good basic guide to writing a mystery from inspiration to book signings. The instructional side of things is enlivened by showing a mystery novel in the making--""Murder in Montana""--which puts an interesting spin on the process. Frey has a nice, easy style and uses humor to good effect. For the student/writer of mystery fiction, I would also recommendHow to Write a Mysteryby Larry Beinhart."
5,"No Mystery Here -- It's Clear & Great, Too!","James Frey does an exceptional job at helping out authors with this book. It's actually more than a book; I'd call it a guide even though it's not written in a step-by-step format. As a nationally published author of several books, I was slightly skeptical on what I'd learn from this, but I was willing to give it a try.I was wrong! Not about the book, but about what I'd learn -- Mr. Frey tells you so many little tricks to implement that once you've read of them, they seem so natural. If you're writing your first mystery novel, or your tenth, buy this book and you're bound to find something awesome inside that will make your manuscript so much better!Stuart Gustafson"
5,If you buy only One Book on Writing--Buy this one!,Too many people sit down in front of a computer and decide to write a novel without knowing how. Ignoring the craft of writing has put too much boring and dull material in the bookstores. Frey's book is the nuts & bolts of building complicated well-orchestrated characters plus creating a step sheet for an exciting story full of conflict and drama. His chapters on plotting theory and the villain's plot behind the plot are positively brilliant. There comes a time in every writer's career that they have to decide--Am I going to write schlock or a damn good novel. James N. Frey makes the choice easy.
2,Poor examples,"Do not waste your time reading this book. Read Carolyn Wheat's Funhouse of mystery and suspense. This book is ok, but not great. The examples he uses are mostly from his own books. These examples are terrible. You will be able to write a mystery after you read this book, but not a ""damn good"" as evidenced by the popularity of Frey's own books.If Frey could have written a ""damn good"" mystery, then why hasn't he."
5,"Bought This ""for My Daughter""","As a young lad, I was often enticed into buying toys that claimed to soar into the sky 50ft, 100ft, 150ft or more, but I always came away disappointed, because they never lived up to their claims. Based on my childhood experiences, I didn't have high hopes for the Arrowcopter. Wow, was I shocked and amazed when I slung this thing for its first flight, and it effortlessly shot 150ft into the air. Once I started stretching the rubber band to its limit, the arrowcopter easily soared 300ft into the air. It's great fun. Makes a great stocking stuffer for any Dad...I mean, boy or girl."
4,Happy 4 yr old!,My 4 yr old had my 12 yr olds gameboy and i had to order this. He loves Lil Einsteins and this game keep him busy during car rides.
2,Nice-looking but pathetic mounting hardware,"I like the appearance of this rod, but the drywall anchors included are very poor quality. Throw them in the trash and buy some good ones. If you are mounting into studs you will need wood screws which are not included."
3,Review of Moen 5' Curved Shower Rod,"Though the unit is designed well and should work well, its length is not adjustable even by a few inches. Most 5 ft. shower stalls or tubs are not truly 5 ft but are either a few inches longer or shorter. Mine turned out to be shorter and hence could not use the curtain rod as provided. The designers at Moen, should have been sharper and aware of this issue when they provided a fixed length rod. You'd be better off buying a curved rod from a competitor which has an adjustable feature."
4,Looks great!,Easy to install and looks really nice. We used our own drywall anchors as suggested by other reviewers. Lots more space in the shower now
3,Does what it is supposed to.,It does what it was supposed to do but it looks a little cheap. I should have bought one out of the store so I could see what it looks like.
3,eh...,"didn't really work in my application, caused the curtain to stick out too much and my toilet is located right next to my tub, therefore making it a little claustrophobic when going to take a poo. Glad I tested it out before I installed it. I didn't return the thing, its sitting in my basement up in the rafters collecting dust. A shame, really."
5,Fits perfectly,"I was a little worried that this new curtain bar wouldn't fit correctly, but the mounting hardware is solid and makes the shower rod feel equally solid. It went up about as easily as could be expected, it was a little wierd putting up a curved rod that only went in one directon. The extra space is nice in the shower and it has helped to take our bathroom up a notch."
5,Great upgrade and change,"I already bought one of these on Amazon and the second is on the way. Easy to install and it gives you much more room to move around. It adds 6,7,8,9,10 inch's to the shower /bath. Nice looking finish and sturdy."
1,Rod is great but price is absurd,"These go for $50 at big box bath stores. If you use one of the the twenty 20% coupons they send a year to get it for $40, that puts this one essentially at double the price. Amazon products are almost always the cheapest around; they should not allow their reputation to be tarnished by this nonsense. Go to Moen's website; even they put the MSRP at $10 less than this."
1,Horrible,This was a horrible purchase. The only part rx was the 5 foot rod. Neither of the ends or connections were included in the box. It's absolutely unusable.
5,great quality and beautiful,this is great. Had to cut it as it did not fit but still really great product. Easy to assemble.
5,curved shower rod,Love this product; really adds a nice touch in the tub-shower for a 'spa' like feel. Easy to install; looks great.
1,Moen Rod that rusted.,It was a beautiful rod AT FIRST. After about 3 months rust began to appear and now it's just another cheap looking bathroom fixture that needs to be replaced. Because of the rough texture of the rust when you pull the curtain across often as not some of the hooks jump off the rod. I would never recommend this rod. If you don't care about the rust I'm sure you can find a cheaper rod that will rust for much less money.
5,Ace your space!,"Had seen these curved rods in various hotels, and decided to try one at home. Moen generally produces good to excellent quality appliances, and this shower rod is up to their expected standards. The product measurements are accurate, and the rod was installed easily. Buyers should be aware that they will need a few simple tools (drill, screw driver) to set it up. Once the curtain is installed, it will provide a significantly larger showering area than a traditional straight rod/curtain. Very good product!"
5,Perfect,I bought this for our guest bathroom and it looks and works great! Gives you that extra elbow room that you need. It looks expensive and it is sturdy. Very happy with purchase.
5,Great!,"This shower rod is great and matches my fixtures perfectly! Great Service, quick ship, received earlier than i had expected! Definatelly would recomend!"
3,It wasn't fairly easy to install,This is a beautiful shower curtain rod. It wasn't fairly easy to install. The roller hooks that come with it roll really nice. I have a shower curtain I also purchased and it is just simply beautiful. Really sets off the bath.
5,home furnishings,"I realy realy like this product. Everything from timely receipt and condition of product. Installed fairly easily for me ( even by myself), as I did not place it where it had to be cut, which actually brought it out a little further than expected. I have always been a Moen customer and am still. They fully back their products and one quick phone call and they will ship you free, any replacement part of their products that may break from usuage over time. My home is 11 years old and my kitchen faucet acted up a short time ago and they had me a replacement part(s)in 2 days! No shipping or parts cost to me. Their product garantee of their products is impeccable. I really like this product. It gave me tons of extra room in my shower without always touching the shower curtain. My only regret is I only bought one. I will most likely buy another for an inner shower curtain, and a double bar one for my spare bathroom."
5,Great Product,"This was fairly simple to install. My only complaint is that they don't include screws for insertion into a stud (they only include molly-bolts for use with drywall). Luckily we had a few in the garage. I'd recommend this shower-bar concept--the bar gives you elbow-room in the shower, and it looks pretty, too. I bought shower curtain rings with the little balls above to make them slide easier. Looks great."
3,Nice but not easy,"Bought this last year December, with the plan to replace the straight shower rod I was to tired of. Well, after having to gut my shower in April, I finally got it up. Easy to install, it wasn't. I can tell you the screws and drywall anchors provided are more then likely, not going to work. If your installing on tile or studs then you have to go to the hardware store to buy the screws. I had hope that I won't have to cut this but after installing one of the brackets and having it come partly out of the wall while I tried to get the rod to hook to the other side. Well, I knew then that I was going to have to cut it. Like it has been stated several times, its better to cut a small amount at a time which I did three times. I did replace 5 of the 6 drywall anchors with much better ones, so that the brackets were nice and sturdy. I'll have to see how well it hold up after a few months."
4,So close,"The quality is good with this flag, my only problem with it is the outer hem. The outer hem folds up the exterior fleur-de-lis on the Lion Rampant and the toes of the triple lion. Other than that, it's fine. The artwork is good, and I appreciate that the Irish harp has white strings instead of a cheaper cop-out with the gold."
2,damaged in shipping,I bought this unit along with a set of loading ramps from Northern Tool.They ship in the standard retail package. The sweeper arrived with abadly damaged and bent wheel spindle and the ramps with less than halfof the required fasteners. Both cartons were damaged due to improperpackaging. Heavy and irregular shaped items should be re-packaged forshipping. Northern apologized and that was the end of it. Sending backthis type of item is a hassle so I will remedy both problems.I will buy items like this locally from now on........cheaper in thelong run. This sweeper at best is worth about $35.
2,Not Worth The Money,I purchased this item for my 8 year old grandson for Christmas. It is very similiar to the show which is what convinced me to buy the game. The captions are great but reading the captions is much more fun than playing the game.My grandson played with this game all of 30 minutes and then said this is a very boring game. I may take it to the local Gamestop and trade it for something better.
3,Verhoeven for better or worse,"This film is necessary only for the Verhoeven completist. There is no trace of the films to come (Spetters, Fourth Man, Robocop) and video and audio are no more than acceptable."
2,BORING......,"Can't sleep at night? Just put on this movie and will help you fall asleep in a nano second.....Slow melodramatic movies are not my cup of tea. I am sure though, that other people might enjoy it. I guess, I failed to see the Poetry in it."
4,Arabic Decameron,"Also a ""Thousand and One Night Stories"" (""Arabian Nights"") was fairytales somehow remembered from an early kidulthood, watching this sexy staff is a real fun after reading newspapers of islamist advances worldwide nowadays.It is hard to believe that ancestors so addicted to sex left behind just blood thirst well-based on a complete ignorance to the neighbour.Not so bad movie also characters are played by actors with quite average appearances on any level while DVD extras are really poor contextually."
2,eh,"This book struck me as being saddled with two principal flaws. One, Stableford loves to use the five-dollar-words, and neither his dialogue nor his interior monologues (even given that this book is supposed to be the autobiography of its principal character) ring true at all. No actual human beings talk or think the way Mortimer Gray does. The style is turgid in the extreme.Two, for a philosophical novel of ideas, there's little that's innovative. The philosophical issues of ""spacer vs. planet-dweller"", ""genetic engineering vs. cyborging"", ""hedonism vs. stoicism"", and even ""death vs. life"" are not dealt with in a way that is more interesting or entertaining than has been done by previous authors. Plus, Stableford commits the great error (in my mind) of actually trying to depict the contents of a Great Work for the Ages.Bruce Sterling's _Schismatrix_ went over much similar ground 15 years ago in a much more entertaining way."
4,Their last rockin' disc,"Not their debut, but still kick a**! 'Reach for the sky' may just be my favorite song by them. Good, bouncy pop-metal, enjoy cause it all goes south for them after this one!"
1,Tastes like cardboard,"I have been buying the unsweetened carob chips from a local high end supermarket. I decided to try these since they cost less. What a mistake! These taste like cardboard! I was very disappointed after having bought 5 lbs. thinking they would be the same. These are awful! I had to throw them out and go back to buying the other ones at the supermarket. Sometimes it doesn't pay to try and save money, in this case it didn't. Also, when they arrived, 2 packages were melted, so they were not packaged well."
2,sweet tooth,I was fairly disapointed with this product. I wanted to make homemade candies but this product does not melt in a creamy fashion. It is all clumpy.
1,junk,"i bought one of these and hung the engine from it and it colapsed, spend the money and get an OTC"
4,"Some of this stuff is truely ""Hard To Find""","I've been listening to and collecting recorded music since 1960. I've had several of the songs in this collection on 45rpm vinyl for years, but finding them digitally has been tough. I reccommend this collection to old farts and folks who like old fart music. Great stuff!!"
5,Great find,I purchased this CD to get Midnight Mary - Joey Powers aftering hearing the song on XM radio. This CD is a great find for those wanting to get digital copies of these old songs.
5,Eric Records stands for QUALITY,"You just have to listen to this CD...people complain about some of the songs being ""obscure""...16 of the 21 tracks were Top 20 hits...maybe not the tired stuff you hear on the local ""oldies"" station, but this series bases a song's validity more on merit than anything else."
3,Hard to find & some for a reason!,Patty Duke singing is forgettable. The later cover of Sukiyaki much better. Utopia is not so hot. The G-Clffs: I Understand is memorable. I had not heard it for quite a while. Nancy Wilson- How Glad I Am - that I found you again.. Bad To Me & Have I the Right recalls the early days of the British Invasion.Listen to the clips and decide for yourself.
1,Laurel & Hardy Masters of Comedy,"THE MASTERS OF COMEDYLAUREL & HARDYThis is one box with 2 DVDs that have 12 movies.There is one short talky with about 30 famous (old)actors in walk-on parts.The remaining shorts are all silent including a really long home movie at maybe Laulrel's house, with kids doing kid stuff ....boring!Many are poor quality and some are just Laurel and some are just Hardy.Silent movies are not much good for me, I was expecting all talkies."
3,"Nice size, NOT WHITE!","This is a perfect size for my child's nursery. The shape is attractive and the basket arrived in good condition. Unfortunately, as another reviewer mentioned, this basket is not white. It has a very thin white ""glaze"" on it, for lack of a better term. You can easily see the tan wicker color through it.I had to paint the basket white in order for it to match my trim."
3,Nice size but not pure white as expected,"I ordered this laundry hamper for my baby's nursery, which is mainly white furniture. The hamper was described as white wicker, but when it arrived it was a light white wash color, not as in the picture, you can almost see the cream/yellow wicker color coming through.The nice thing was the interchangeable colored ribbons; green, blue, white and pink.It is a good size, so I am going to keep the hamper even though it is not the pure white color I was expecting, or saw in the image."
4,Wicker Hamper,"The hamper is sturdy and attractive. My daughter loves the color choices for the sash. It did arrive with one tiny wicker piece broken off in the box, but other than that, it arrived in good condition and on time."
1,I am very surprised at the 5 star rating of this book,I read this book and found it boring at times and inconsistent in terms of how it flowed. I think the mix of Afghan womens stories and American activists stories being compiled in one book was a good idea. The book did not spark interest in me and didn't fully grasp my attention the way other books have or Afghan women that I have met in real life have. In my opinion it was poorly written:(
3,Not written too well,I found this book a little difficult to read. I was expecting a powerful & gripping call to support these women. But instead got a dry read without continuity and just a statement of facts. Some folks may like that. But it wasn't for me. I still though support the cause and therefore 3 stars...
3,Another crime,"This a great action film, more than good enough to be on DVD, don't you think? I'm saddened every day by the older films that don't make it to DVD, and shocked at some of the things that do. There doesn't seem to be any real criteria for either situation. Anything with Charles Durning as the star is usually worth watching. This would be a great movie for all grandpas to watch with their grandsons. It's never going to happen though."
5,Entertaining and educating,"Evelyn Kaye gives a delightfully entertaining glimpse of what travelling was like in the 1800's. I found the book inspirational in that the subject, Isabella Bird, was determined to find adventure at every turn - and it really came out in Kaye's book. Well worth space on your home library shelf."
5,Linear and Rigorous,"Lulushi did a wonderful job in laying out this book. He explains the basics simply - in all cases giving numerous examples. The reader is lead from building her first form all the way to putting some meaningful database form modules on the web. This is a great reference book in addition to an extremely AWEsome tutorial. All in all a great addition to my library. I am an Oracle Certified Professional DBA and am having a hard time keeping this book on my shelf - Both my users and fellow DBAs have become enamored with this one (Perhaps, I should buy another copy and hide it!). This book covers all the improvements that are in the 6i release! As Oracle puts it: ""The web changes everything!"". Thank you Albert. A great follow up to your Forms 5.0 book. Keep'em coming....."
2,Frustrating and full of inaccuracies,"This is a tutorial, NOT a reference. As an experienced Oracle/IT professional, trying to learn Oracle Forms from this book has been extemely frustrating. The author is verbose rather than concise. Important information about a single topic may be spread across several sections making it difficult to get an answer to a specific question. As another reviewer stated, the index is weak. The author offers many warnings and tips that I eventually learned to test out for myself because, in a lot of cases, were just plain not true. There are tutorials on OOP, SQL, and PL/SQL that are tedious if you already have that background. I'd reccomend this book only for someone with little Oracle background who has a lot of time and patience."
2,Could be better,"The book is full of typos and mistakes in the code examples. Even with that the book has been helpful in some situations but hard to use. It is written like a huge tutorial and if you don't get something in the previous section, the next section doesn't work. I just want to know how to do the code. I want specific examples that aren't dependent on other parts of the book. Why can't there be more books on this subject to choose from?"
1,The Index was HORRIBLE. No CD? C'mon I paid [$$$],"A refence book without a good index becomes a novel you have to skim through. I had to do this on several occasions. What is sad is that the Table of Contents was pretty in depth (17 pages which is more than the index). When I need an answer I want a place in the book that will point me somewhere near the item I'm looking for. I was lucky because I had read the thing from cover to cover, so I had a general idea where to look. It covers the various form elements in advanced, but I could have gotten the same data from a help file.It would have been more useful with a better index. I found the downloadable sample files, but why not have a CD? Not recommended for the beginning Oracle user."
5,The best Christmas gift received,"I do love a good read. One of my favorite gifts was the set of Ellen Phillips's ""consumer empowerment"" books. I actually began reading Fight Back and Win first as I knew it had a large section on senior/elderly issues. Even if I never write a complaint letter, I now own a valuable resource that tells me anything I want to know or how to find it out. The author is amazing. She doesn't condesend to us older people, and her sense of humor helps when discussing some of the self-help promotions that often make me feel ill-at-ease with younger so-called experts.Of course if and when I get reday to write any sort of complaint letter, she shows me just how to do it to get the desired results. I can't thank Ms. Phillips enough (nor my daughter-in-law who gifted me with these wonderful books)."
5,Excellent storage for my convertaball,What more can be said about simple storage for a convertaball. This works great to organize my MasterLock Interchangeaable Mount Hitch Ball in Chrome. Worth the small price for organization and protection.
4,Holds all 3 and keeps 'em from rolling,"This little bag will hold all three Switch A Ball balls (1-7/8"", 2"", and 2-5/16"") and will keep them from rolling around or knocking into things and making noise when stashed in your tow vehicle. On the down side, it's just one single pocket for all 3 balls, and it doesn't provide any loops or tabs you could use to say, hang the bag on."
5,Fender 346s,These picks are great for strumming acoustically or on electric. They are easy to hold and provide great tone. I would highly recommend these.
2,"Great looks, poorly made","Great looking system, although it does not keep temp at all so it is unusable as a wine cooler. If it worked well I would not have a problem and it would get 5 stars, however it was unplugged and moved about 2 miles safely, sat for 48 hours then plugged back in...temp stays around 72. Too bad."
2,Hardly Mexican Cuisine,"I was so disappointed in this book, especially after reading the reviews of others. Perhaps the author wrote the book for people who have no access to ingredients typically used in Mexican cookery, which 10 years ago might have been somewhat an excuse, but today, authentic Mexican ingredients are widely available. To those interested in real Mexican cuisine, there are much better choices, with this caveat; it's really too bad the author chose not to give us authentic recipes, as the cooking in this particular region of Mexico has not been covered well, and I have searched extensively."
2,"TOO MANY WORDS, LITTLE STRATEGIES...","At the start, you are reading, and reasing without finding any strategies you can use. After reaching 32% of the book you get to some images. You are suppose to study these diagrams and images... However these have failed to display, so you are left wondering. The entire book than offers more lengthy explanations with little strategies a normal person can use. If you plan to walk 3 miles a day, take about 12 different supplements x day, sex enhancement medications and abstain yourself from ejaculation than maybe this book could be for you, otherwise, please don't waste your time or money."
4,Good to know..,"This book is real informative about a topic nobody talks about but everyone wants to know. Cool facts and strategies included. I personally enjoyed the section on horomones and male cycles. However, I was looking for a little more magic to assist. In the end it just comes down to will power."
1,History Falsification,"This book is the real example how Communists and Soviet Union did the falsifications of the real history. I started reading that book and it looks like the author used the sources the KGB provided specially for him. You cannot compare that book with “Enemy at the Gates” by William Craig, where the different sources were used in order to help readers to understand the real history of the WWII. I would recommend reading that book to anybody who wants to get the real picture about WWII and how Soviet Union won the battles. But Albert Axell copied the books I used to read when I was a kid in Soviet Union and our grandfathers told us that the real history of that war is different."
5,Love these watches,These timex sport ironman watches are packed with features. There are more features than I would ever use. I bought this on amazon because it was the only place where I could find the purple---love the purple. My friend has the blue one. We are both more than happy with our watches. I wear mine in the pool and ocean and don't have problems either.One thing I do not like too much is that the bands seem impossible to find replacements for--so you have to buy a whole new watch. But usually when I am ready to look for a new band I'm ready for a new watch anyway.One advantage with this ironman over previous versions is that the numbers are slightly bigger--which helps as I am getting older. The size of the watch remained the same though.
3,Pyramid TW17 2-Inch 200 Watts Satelite Tweeter .. eh? $20.. satisfied.,"The sound quality is fairly decent. The construction is pretty beefy as well, strong and heavy. However, the plastic anchor or brace used to connect the speaker to the car is weak. How the speaker and the brace hold together is weak as well. It won't fall out or anything, but it just has a generic twist-click feeling that just feels like the pieces were constructed from low quality materials (and yea, they were).BUT, the speakers do work, and do the job. 2"" tweeters look a little bulky, but if thats what you're asking for, you know what you're doing. I haven't blasted them yet to check to see what they can handle, but from the looks of them, I'm not expecting much, dont forget the price is super reasonable. I guess one way to look at them is they were speakers you would find at a swap meet or a garage sale, and made in china or mexico, but leaning more towards mexico."
1,Buyer be AWARE,This is a terrible death trap for regular hamsters. Bought this cage for my daughter's hamster and thought at first it was great. My daughter loved the colorful pieces in the cage. However BE AWARE it is hard to keep together as the pieces are a challenge to make fit. The worst thing is the tube that runs up the cage. Our hamster got stuck and almost died. This is not suitable for regular hamsters. This cage should only be used for very small animals like the robot hamster. The top cage also have a very week latch and our hamster escaped twice by just pushing up the top latch. This cage should be a recall!!! I would not recommend this cage.
2,Save your money if you see Amazon listing a cage,"I was disappointed with this cage. I do not think this cage was new at all, as Amazon had advertised. The wheel was already assembled. There were scratches already on the wheel like somebody had used it. The wheel does not even sit on the turning table. All the materials that came in packaging were wrapped in plastic tied together with red tape...why did you advertise that this product was new when it was not Amazon?! I am disappointed because I was expecting better straight from the company, and this was my first time ordering straight from Amazon. It also took the company a long time to ship the product. Usually when I buy from other people on Amazon they ship next day, it took Amazon 4 days to ship, which was annoying. I am not a happy customer."
2,Cheap piece of junk,"Don't waste your time on this cage because it will ultimately end up in the trash! It is very cheap. We had to replace the ball the first week due to my daughter dropping it on the floor and the plastic broke into pieces (a wood floor). Our hamsters escaped (3 different hamsters on 3 separate occasions) and all three ended up with the cat! If you want to forego the heartache for your child in losing their pet this cage is poorly designed and easy for the animal to escape! They constantly used the ball for a nest, dragging their bedding into it. So much for the exercise ball. They also used the look out area as their bathroom and that is hard to clean out! Nearly every part of this plastic cheap contraption of ours is duck taped together because it has broken so easily. Do not buy this, it is easy to put together but is flimsy, the plastic is flimsy and will not last!!!!!"
1,cheap,"Although it has already been said, it can't be pointed out enough. The hamsters escape because of the cheap quality.We have had the cage for 2 months and now she is escaping easily. The flimsy device designated to hold the ball in comes up allowing the hamster to wiggle out through the opening. We have taped it down and that works well except she now can't use the ball for exercise. The ball gets dirty fast so it requires daily cleaning. The cage comes completely apart when you go to clean the base and the plastic snaps to hold it together have broken. If the hamster wasn't getting out all of the time I'd give it 2 or 3 stars, but if it can't do the most basic of functions then what's the point."
3,Tough to clean,"This little hamster house is definitely tough to get apart. We haven't snapped any of the pieces yet, but it feels like a matter of time. In retrospect, I would have ordered some of the pieces that close off the tubes, at least temporarly. Our little guy is quite shy just yet and he suspends himself inside the tubes. Which is not only frustrating, but also a little freaky. Initially, my kids tried to ""shake"" him out - which was a really bad idea and probably reportable to the humane society (although they meant him no harm). It would be easier to handle him if he was restricted to the ""main floor"" until he gets used to us. Just a thought."
2,Not happy with this cage ...,"Since purchasing this cage three months ago, my hamster has been able to escape several times through the top satellite room on this cage. Also, every time I clean this cage, it comes all apart and the small plastic latches are easily broken. I would not purchase this cage again and now I already have to look for another one since my black bear hamster keeps escaping."
1,HAMSTER NOW DEAD THANKS TO THIS CAGE! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!,"My hamster ""Buttercup"" is now dead thanks to this piece of crap cage! The plastic top of the lookout tower was so cheaply made that it popped open several times. I paid almost $70.00 for this worthless mess of a cage too and it is only a couple of months old. Last night my hamster popped open the top and escaped and at some point ran into my Himalayan cat and I found him dead on my kitchen floor. It was horrible :(.This product is overpriced for the quality of it. In the future I will go with a wire cage that will be sure to keep my hamster secure and safe. I'm very dissatisified with this product!!!"
3,Nice little cage but gets messy,My daughters got this as a gift along with a hamster for Christmas. The cage is cute and colorful. At frst I though it was great because of the ball which he could run in attached to his cage and then the ball could come off so he can run around in it while cleaning the cage. I quicly found out that the ball was a bad idea. The hamster found it very cozy and began spending all his time in it. Which included pooping and peeing in it. So as he would run it would make a lot of noise from the poop flying in it plus because the ball needs to have little air holes the poop was flying out all over the carpet. Needless to say I took the ball off and got him a wheel and another attachment for the top but then I had an open hole at the top so I had to cover it with cardboard (not very attractive) but I couldn't find a new top to replace it without the hole for the ball. Hope this helps.
3,Great cage... but the ball is hard to clean,"I read all the reviews before purchasing this case for my nieces as a christmas gift. From what I read the cage was easy to clean. I bought the hampster 2 weeks prior to handle it. But I had to clean the ball once a day. It's great because the hampster was getting plenty of excercise but he was in it all the time. Which means he poops and pees in it all the time. If not taken apart and cleaned once a day, it tends to get dirty really fast and start to smell. My sister ended up buying something else to replace it. Other than that the cage is good."
2,Poor Quality,"I did not purchase this from Amazon but a pet store. This was ok for about a month and then the ball attachment began to break down. Once that happens this cage is basically worthless because the ball attachment covers a huge opening at the top of the cage. I also agree with a previous review that the hamsters prefer to nest in the ball, which means much more noise from seeds and shells being tossed around. I'm already seeking a new cage for my sons hamsters."
2,Blah,"Bought this from Petco for use with Gerbils just last weekend and am already moving to a fish tank. I had the cage on my wooden garage workbench. The ball rolled off the top of the cage onto the workbench and the clips that hold the ball together broke. The depth of the bottom pan is not nearly deep enough as half the bedding ends up on our floors. The ball clouded up from gerbil waste within hours of them moving in, requiring it to be cleaned daily, unless you like watching waste go around in circle. Ball was noisey and really seemed to be held on ever so precariously. Really not pleased with this cage."
5,The Way of the Elders,"This book did not disappoint. The Doumbia's are wonderful writers, historians and storytellers. Packed full of traditions and wisdoms. This one is a keeper."
1,"Horrible Locks, Avoid!!!!","We tried to install the locks for our new house. None of them fit a standard door! Also, the key wouldn't unlock the knob for the door and the key only unlocked the deadbolt halfway! I'm going to have to return them if amazon lets me. Do yourselves a favor and avoid the locks. They're tempting because they're cheap but there's a reason they're so inexpensive!!!"
1,THESE LOCKS ARE NOT STANDARDIZED... AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!,"I purchased 10 packs of these locks and had such a difficult time installing them that they are now sitting on my shelf as multiple ""shelf racks"".I paid ~ $14 for each of these locks and they are not standard. The other writer was correct. The part that you install on the inside of the hole is longer than that of kwikset, schlage and other standardized locks.I did not have a drill or a tool to increase the depth of my existing circle for the hole and as a result, could not get the piece to fit.I spent almost an hour trying to install one lock and I can normally install a quickset or other lock in about 6 to 10 minutes.I am dissapointed and do believe in the old saying that ""YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR"". What I got was a waste of my money.*******Right now they are retailing for $29.99 and they are not worth the $14 that I paid for them.Thanks Amazon for letting me share my opinion."
2,spin mess,"So we were very excited to open this and start making cool art. But the paper was too big, so I had to trim it with a very excited 4 year old dancing next to me. Then, the thing wouldn't spin fast enough to splatter the paint. They should make a plug in version. Also, the refills sold are for the Alex spin art and the paper is the wrong size and the paints with that refill are PERMANENT!!!.Not like the one I bought my older sons when they were little."
2,Stained hands & nails.,"Cool toy, kids had fun, but it would be nice if it came with a warning that the paint is pure NON WASHABLE liquid that WILL stain your skin, nails, and nail edges incredibly, that would have been helpful. My hands look ridiculous & I barely touched the thing. Work aught to be interesting tomorrow!"
3,Paint seems to smear more than anything,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and it is pretty flimsy and most of the time the paint would all fly to one side of the paper with a few splatters all around, but kids really like it because they are making they're own pictures and it's fun to watch, so if you're considering this, I'd say give it a shot at least once."
2,Don't buy it...,It is the very first that I feel a toy is completely 'purposeless' and a waste of money and time. It is poorly designed and a disaster to clean up after the mess.Just buy the washable paints and paper - a lot more fun than the spin thingie here.
2,Not much magic here,"This toy has multiple issues, from getting more of the customized sized cardboard canvas pieces to getting them to fit in the device, I don't think this toy is much fun. When you follow the directions your art looks more like poorly placed blobs on paper. You have to trick the thing into working correctly. Not very exciting."
5,I haven't used it myself,"My granddaughter loves this toy. I haven't seen her use it yet, but I understand that there is now a higher lip on it to keep the paint from going all over."
3,Gave it as a gift,"I bought this spin art as a college graduation gift for a friend that had great memories of using Spin Art in the past. It was just a fun thing, but she was very excited!"
4,Impressive survey of Nineteenth Century Britain,"Nineteenth century Britain packs a mean punch. At a slender 300+ pages it astutely documents the staggering amount of history in Britain during the nineteenth century. No stone goes unturned from economic, social, and politicall ideas to the intricate and all encompassing aspects of Britain during this time period. Black and Macdonald present this history in and orderly and accessible fashion that allows even novice readers to understand the complexities that occurried in Britain during the nineteenth century. At times the scope of information can be overwhelming, but I find it necessary in order to understand the complexities of history. It is an indispensable source for those studying the nineteenth century!"
3,ADEQUATE AT BEST,"If one is looking for a quick book on the top villians of the Nazi regime, and does not care for anything more than a few facts and figures here and there, than this book is fine. Snyder does indeed tell us about the lives and times of Hitler's henchman. Sadly, though, the characters never come alive and one is likely to finish the book feeling dissapointed. Avid readers should look to other sources. In one area I also took issue with Snyder. Again and again he argues that these Nazis were guided by blind obedience to Hitler. Whatever Hitler wanted, so did they. But is this accurate? Was Goering blindly obedient when he leaked information about Barbarosa to the world? Was Himmler in negotiating with the allies in 1945? Certainly not Hess, who humiliated Hitler by flying to Britain in May of 1941. In the end I believe only Goebbles could be said to have been blindly obedient."
2,A mixture of facts and sensationalism.,"There are some interesting moments and information presented in this book, such as most of the Nazi inner circle had high IQ's. However, the overall tone of the book is not historical, rather it is biased towards the author's viewpoints and sensationalized. Any good historical work should present just the facts, no matter how notorious the subject(s) happen to be without any spin to grab book sales. Snyder should have read John Toland's ""Hitler"" before undertaking this work."
2,Sensationalized sketches,"I agree with what others have said...this work is too biased to be taken seriously. The overall tone is emotional and sensationalistic, rather than factual. Also, this is a fairly old work (the version I have dates to 1989) and many of the ""facts"" have since been disproved by other historians. For example, the story of Heydrich shooting at his reflection in the mirror, or that he had a Jewish grandfather or grandmother. While it gets the ""big picture"" right on these awful people, it really fails in the details- to the point you don't know what the author says as fact is fiction."
3,"sensationalized, but contains good information anyway","While you can tell that this is a mass-market paperback (the type found in the 'true crime' section rather than the 'history' section) by its unapologetically emotional tone, there are still good reasons to use it as a quick reference.The motivations, thoughts and attitudes attributed to the characters here should generally be checked before accepting as fact, but the basic events they were involved in are mostly accurate enough. A particular gem is the inclusion of the sentencing statement of the Israeli judge who sent Eichmann to the gallows, which I have since quoted a number of times for its eloquence and reason. Recommended with the above caveats."
4,Good,"Good book. I think the author shows Jesus main message was one of love - as Jesus Himself demonstrates here: ""But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me."" Luke 19:27"
5,AMAZING BOOK,I wanted to give you my review by saying this person Dr. James Gardner has an incredible mind and spirit to have written this book. I can not begin by saying every one should own a copy of his book. It explains so many different things in such detail.I am very impressed how a person can take an idea and research countless of books to explain to any one who reads this who Jesus really was.Thank you Jim and I will recommend your book to everyone.Jim QuinnNewport Beach Califoria
1,Illogical and NOT scholarly,"I was very disappointed. The author's reasonng is fallacious, his research spotty. Could have been written by a high school sophomore. There are much better works out there."
1,I should have heeded the warnings,"I heard numerous bad reviews for this movie. it was even on Mystery Science Theatre 3000! Yet, the cover grabbed me in, and I rented it. I haven't even watched thirty minutes, and yet i know it's the worst werewolf movie yet. Bad camera work, horrible effects, a fight scene that I could've made look more realistic, and for gosh sakes, the first werewolf looks like he's got a Wal-Mart mask on. The werewolf skull that somehow keeps effecting people has ear bones! The fight scene looked worse than WCW, and that's saying a lot! Plus, why would a werewolf decide to kill a man by choking him to death, rather than eating him? If you see this movie, see it for laughs, like the part with the werewolf in the hospital gown, where you can see they didn't even bother to put hair make-up on his back."
1,Werewolf not drive car,The best scene in this hideous movie answers a question we all may have posed at one time or another. Just how long can you drive a car when you are turning into a werewolf? The answer: quite a long time. The film is also noteable for a scene depicting the world's most helpful victim; a geezerly bumpkin who moans in horror while actually continuing to move TOWARDS the werewolf. Must be seen to be believed.
1,This was on Mystery Science Theater 3000,"Yes, that is true. This movie was Featured on MST3K. For those of you who have seen this movie, you can tell why. Truly horrible, badly lite, bad acting, Joe Esteves, you aren't your brother. STOP ACTING! the werewolf scenes were cheap and boring, the blood looked exactly like paint. To the director. You can make bad movies, but dont make a bad movie that you want to be good. It doesnt work"
1,The most ridiculous movie ever made.,"A gallon of rum could not have made this film more incomprehensible. The plot is laughable, the characters more so and the effects are the worst ever. Couple this with the most egregious production values and, I think you'll agree that this is the worst movie ever made. However, it is worth seeing for the unintentionally comic soundtrack."
2,"""Dis Is Absolutly Fussinating""",to understand this word see this movie on mst3k the next time they air i
3,Not for serious Sanrio fans,"I got this book as a gift, and was glad that I didn't pay for it. It's got some content, but most of it is just ""fluff"" for tha hardcore Sanrio fan. It has lots of pictures, including some vintage (that's my favorite Sanrio item(s) to collect). This theme has a lot of potential, and I hope someone makes a more definitive Sanrio ""history"" book, with more characters & information. I'm working on my own Sanrio history & such for my site ...that will have more of a history of the Sanrio Company. It was a good attempt, but could have been better if written by a more hardcore Sanrio fan."
4,"hello kitty, hello (not quite) everything","While i would love to see an all-encompassing book detailing *everything* in the evolution of kitty, this isn't a bad place to start. It's really more of a novelty book, but I for one, was surprised to learn that there's even a dang HK vespa! and now i can not rest until it's mine.The pages are laid out very clearly, and the uh...""necessities"" are well organized. I would recommend this book if you can get a slight break on the price."
2,"Gardening, Not Design","Although a good book on planting a small garden this book is not, as I thought by its title, a book on designing small gardens. There are only two fairly complete gardens shown amidst the many beautiful pictures of plants. The book deals almost exclusivly with the planting and growing of flowers, primarily perennials, bulbs,has a chapter on houseplants and treats the subject of soil amendments, fertilizers and such. If you need to know what plants to use in your small garden, this book will help."
5,A No-Bull Garden Book,"This good is a clear step-by-step blueprint for creating a garden virtually anywhere. The author has a dry, ascerbic wit and is a great debunker of misconceptions about plants, as well as a bit of a plant historian. It's a really good read, as well as a really good manual."
1,For Beginners Only,"This is a great book for the beginning gardener, but does not provide much information or inspiration for anyone who already knows the basics."
4,"Everybody looks at your watch, but its one of the heaviest watches.","I have this watch since early 2006 and I bearly take it off, its one hell of a tough strongly built piece of machinery. I say machinery because its built like a tank, since its heavy some times while swinging your arm you hit the corner of a brick wall and the watch takes a piece of it. One time I slipped in the shower and it hit a tile and cracked the tile - it is tough !Pros:- Easy to operate- Goodlooking and attracts attention- You will easily feel the gyro winding the watch - you feel the vibrationCons:- The small degrees (angles) dial are too small to read- You will never in a life time use its features (But good to show off that you know how they are used - calculating the direction shift against the wind - towards the port .. . bla bla bla)- Maybe bcoz I am hyperactive it is starting to advance 5 minutes every 30 days :("
5,Warning : Student driver !,Have you ever rode the school bus?Did you have a nice bus driver and then you got a mean bus driver?If you want the experience read Dont get driving the school bus to learn how it feels.I have read alot of books but this the is the first book I dont want to put down.This book is about a kid named Kyle who thinks he is the class clown.After school he gets on the bus and he has a bad bus driver who will get you in trouble if you switch seats. He used to have to try to get the mean bus driver to quit.I like that the book has a related part because I am a sixth grader like kyle and his friends.I realy recommend this book to people who like read books about a trouble maker.you should read this book because you will wet your pants with laughter.ISABEL
3,Too sweet,"I bought this CD as las Faez' contribution to *Casa de la Trova* is the best part of a first-rate album. On *Casa de la trova* [buy now!], their voice timbre does reveal their age -- circa 69 and 71 at the time; the previous reviewer here seems to have added a decade -- but there's nothing geriatric about the spirit of the performances. Unfortunately this has rather gone to pot in *La trova de las Faez*, which is considerably less spirited. I listened twice, but gave up and reached for one of my collection of ""Tumbao Cuban Classics"". Sample before buying."
2,boring,This c.d. sounds like a school boys recital. There is no excitement at all. He has all the notes and they are all produced alike. Very Ho Hum
2,Waste of talent. Bad sound!,I was expecting a lot more from this DVD-A.It is actually the worst sounding DVD-A I own.Good thing I bought it used. You are better off just buying the CD version.
3,"Average, but enjoyable",I agree with other reviewers that this is only an average read. But the story of this Antarctic adventure is still remarkable and anyone interested in women's outdoor adventures will find this book enjoyable.
2,Great story poorly told,"My bookclub chose this book this month and we were very excited by the subject matter. What a disappointment! I've never read such a poorly, blandly and simply written book about such an expansive, exciting and complicated subject! I felt like I was reading a book written for 4th graders, being talked down to to make it simple. I found no difference between the 2 voices of Ann and Liv and would have prefered a much more detailed account of their expedition. I have no doubt that their trip was fascinating in so many ways, unfortunately, they weren't able to translate that into their book. Maybe as educators of children they forgot that adults like a good story on a more sophisticated level.Too bad."
2,An average read,An interesting story but only an average read. Jumping from one author to another is distracting. There are many other books written about women doing remarkable journeys that make a better read an deserve attention.
3,Good Story,This is an interesting adventure that contains some good information. These two women had fortitude. Some information is repeated as each character tells her story. Lacks vibrant description but reads quite well.
3,Disapointing,"Celia Watkins, Dallas TXThis story is one of enormous sums of money and a large team of people to get two women across Antarctica. Three authors in one book produces too much confusion. Parts of the story are well written, while others, mostly by the adventurers themselves, ramble, sometimes in a self serving manner. Several photos are noteworthy, while others are washed out in color. This is not one of the classic adventure books."
1,Horrible,"I received the item and was just kind of surprised on how crappy it is made. The glass on the clock was broke when I opened the box. The clock does not work, and I'm not even sure how you would get to it anyways to adjust the time. The pen looks nice, but may be made out of plastic. It weighs about one gram and is extremely flimsy. The packer guy on top is cool, I am basically just using it as an over priced paper weight."
5,Enviroment,When this aired on PBS we watch. Everyone should own a copy of this. It's sad to see what is happening to our planet.
1,AWFUL! -a waste of time to watch,This was by far & away the worst documentary on Global Warming I've ever seen. No research or evidence is used to support the film's assertions. ...more informative and evidence-based conclusions on Global Warming can be found at any grammer school science fair.PBS should pull this one off the market. It is a shame!
1,Peeved,"I passed up local opportunities to purchase Alfred Sung's Shi. It is difficult to find, and the only thing that I have worn for the past few years. The lotion and cream that are included in this set, were the deciding factor for me. It is nearly impossible to find a full set these days. I knew something was wrong when the color of the Parfum was greenish. The body lotion and hand cream felt only approximately one fifth full. They both smelled stale. When I removed the lids, there was residue in side the tops. After rancid appearing ooze fell out of the hand cream tube, I was compelled to warn people: who, as I, depend on the reviews of people who work too hard for their money to be scammed. I am peeved. I will not have the opportunity to buy this until Valentine's day."
4,"Lokar ,,good product","It does work just fine, and looks good on my 36 coupe,good price and fast shipping,what can i say i like it"
3,not so pleased with book,"This was a fine transaction, but the edition of the book received was not what I expected..it was an old edition..new, but out of date. I've learned to check further before ordering! O"
4,Infant Hulk costume,This costume fit well except the head piece was a little large but my son's head is on the small side. The material is light weight and there was enough room to fit an outfit underneath. My son is only 6 months but he weighs 22lbs (hence the hulk costume:) so it should fit the average 12 month old. It was adorable on!
5,Too cute,My one year old wore this for Halloween and he looked adorable in it. He even wore the hat without too much hassle.
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,My order actually came 1 day earlier than estimated. This is great considering I did a last minute ordering. Great quality and cheaper than retail stores. I would definitely recommend you and others to order.
2,Hard to tell that the baby is Hulk,This costume looks much better on this baby than it did on my live baby. It was very hard to tell he was the Hulk and the costume is very cheaply made. Hat does not stay position well either.
4,Hilarious and awesome,"We got this for our 6 month old for Halloween. It was a little big, but it looked great on him and he seemed very comfortable. The construction and material is really cheap so just know going in, this is not a high quality costume. However it was a definite hit at the party we went to."
4,Need their charger,"This battery worked fine in my camera, but does not fit in the Kodak charger. It also doesn't charge when in the camera using the Kodak dock. You must use their charger."
1,4 Runs and it's flat,"I wish I had seen the review after this one before making this purchase. Just as they said, the tube went flat after just 4 runs, ending my kids sledding trip very prematurely, a real disappointment for all of us. On the plus side, it worked very well and was very fast for a few runs. Also, delivery was fast and uneventfull. Two patches were included to repair hole, but, AND THIS IS IMPORTANT, upon taking the tube home to repair I found the leak was actually the result of a split in the seam between the top and bottom pieces of the tube....MEANING IT IS NOT REPAIRABLE! I am returning the tube today and will update this review if there are any problems getting a refund."
2,didn't last,bought this for a trip to colorado. very flimsy. went flat after it's first use. will try to patch it and use it for water stuff back home.
1,Leaks and gets Holes easily,"I gave this to my daughter for Christmas. It snowed the next day and, after a few trips down the hill, the snowtube began leaking air and one more time down the hill and it ripped a hole in the bottom. For thirty dollars, this tube is JUNK! I am buying a plastic sled, for half the price tha won't die after 20 minutes of sledding!!! DOn't buy this snowtube!"
4,good brief intro,"Bought this book because I'm starting a new job in merchandising. This is really only an introduction read. 14 topics are discussed on less than 140 pages, that's about 2 pg per topic.If you are a student or casual reader looking for an overview of the E industry - great book. If you are a professional I have to repeat that this book is really only a brief overview without depth.Still, if you're interested in the E industry, Mark Vinet gives you a good comprehensive read. * * * *"
2,Sleep Material,"I kept falling asleep when I read this book. Although the author stresses that it's just a preliminary glimpse at the entertainment industry, I think he could at least make it more fun to read. I felt like I was reading a dictionary."
3,"Does anybody remember, 1982 True West EP","This album is good - but does anybody remember a 1981-1982 EP by True West with a GREAT song called Steps to the Door? Anybody know how to get this? This EP also had Lucifer Sam on it, but Steps to the Door was and is a favorite for me. This song had a great psychedelic sound that isn't dated. If you have this EP you're lucky because it's so hard to find."
3,"True West, but not the Truest","A smile-inducing reminder for confirmed believers, this November '84 concert tape is no subsitute for the original True West studio release on Bring Out Your Dead. That record could create fans; *The Big Boot* will only make those who already are sigh at what might have been. Sound is thinner and momentum more erratic than zealots will claim. Delicious cover selection: ""Happenings Ten Years Time Ago."" Prophetic cover selection: ""Lust for Life."""
4,Here's a story everyone needs to know about,"I am so glad this book was written. This is an important part of American history that all of us should know. Esther Morris went west and became part of the movement in Wyoming Territory to win women the right to vote and hold office. Then, to help solidify their position, she applied for and became a Justice of the Peace. She held this position until the next election. The book is more about the suffrage movement and its early beginnings in the American West than it is about Esther Morris' life. But, it's information I didn't know and now, would like to know more about. This will be a good book to read to students and a good lead-in to research more about this interesting topic. I like the illlustrations which enhanced the story."
2,Didn't help at all,"I have an oily skin and all eyeshadows always smudge above my eyes. A friend of mine told this is a great product, sha has skin problems too.. So I went for it, but unfortunatly it did'n help me at all.. :( Maybe I need something srtonger than that."
2,it was okay,It worked great for a base coat for the eyes. It says you can use it for dark circles under the eyes. It did not work at all. I was very disapointed in how the product did I would not buy it again.
3,Sorry! Not Charlie!,"After having listened to alot of Charles Earland music, I thought I would purchase this CD to get some new Earland music.I am sorry to say that, despite a number of very good musicians on this set, it did not remind me of Charles Earland. With all due respect to Joey DeFrancesco, I could not see his playing as ""burning"" like the mighty one did when he was alive.On a positive note, I did like ""Pick Up the Pieces"" and ""South Philly Groove"" as good organ jazz music but it still did not remind me of such great numbers as ""Happy Cause I'm Going Home"" or ""More Today than Yesterday"" that Charles played so well.So, save your money on this one and get the real stuff like ""Intensity"" or ""Slammin' and Jammin"". You won't regret it!"
4,You Shouldn't Oughta Hear What Joey Does To Roberta Flack,"The drummer is in love with his small mounted tom and the recording is a little too echo-y for my taste. But when Joey D's solo on ""The Closer I Get To You"" climaxes, this becomes a must-have disc. ""Defiled"" is the politest word I can think of. Ooh, it's naaasty."
1,Don't waste your time with this trash,"this is trash. the people who made it clearly know it's trash. at the start and ending of the movie they basically give you the middle finger for being stupid enough to watch this piece of trash they made. i repeat, don't waste your time."
2,two stars just for jill Schoelen,"This movie is awful, just awful. But in my quest to see every film Jill is in, I had to buy it. It was a cheap purchase. Jill sports the look she got in When a Stranger Calls back. She does a good job. But everyone seems like they are just sleep walking here. See Jill in Popcorn or Phantom of the Opera instead."
4,Superb,I bought this album mostly in order to test my audio-system - Vivaldi is not my favourite composer. Cecilia Bartoli's technical level is superb and the audio dvd really delivers a perfect sound - it makes you belive that you are sitting at the stalls of La Scala. I hope we will see more arias in this format.
1,what is it ?,"May be it is me but I can not play this album on my DVD player, nor can I listen to it on my CD player.I managed to play it on the sound system of 1 of our cars and it wasspectacular, however, I am not going to buy a new Lexus LS460 to hear Cecilia.It was not made clear, unless I read it wrong that it was not a normalCD.Thats all Folks,Bastiaan Vancouver BC"
5,Somethings never grow old!,Weebles were my Sons favorite toy when he was little. I was so delighted to find them again for the next generation...My Grandson also fell in love with Weebles! They weeble and wobble but they don't fall down!What a wonderful way to unite two different generations or more!
4,AWSOME TOY,THIS IS A WONDERFUL TOY MY 11 MONTH OLD LOVES IT! AS WELL AS MY OLDER CHILDREN THE MUSIC IS LOUD ENOUGH TO ACUTALLY HEAR. VERY DURABLE! WORTH EVERY PENNY! GREAT FOR LITTLE ONES TO EXPLORE.
4,Most played with toy,My daughters LOVE this tree house. It keeps them both (ages 2 and 4) entertained for long stretches. I've been quite surprised by how long this toy has remained popular with them both. The only thing that stops me from rating it a 5 is the volume. It is loud. And there is no on/off switch for the music. I really don't understand why manufacturers feel the need to make things loud and I intensely dislike not being able to turn it off. (Also the price of $60 here on Amazon is ridiculous. You can buy it for half of that.)
3,Volume control would make it perfect,"Great fun, interative but...This toy would earn 5 stars if there was either an on/off switch for the volume, or some kind of volume control. It's way too loud..."
3,Very Loud!,"My son loves the tree house, but as a Mother- I HATE IT!! It doesn't have a volume control or an on/off switch. It is very loud and I am concerned about the effect it may have on my sons hearing. Beware!"
5,Happy with my first Weeble purchase!,"This toy is great! There are so many different things for my daughter to do with it: send Weebles down a slide or chute, put them in a swing, rocking chair, or ferris wheel, stand a flag or megaphone into one of three different holes (which definitely challenges my 17-months old's fine motor skills, but is doable!), and more! She will play with it in her play pen for 30 minutes or more with no complaints.My only disappointment with this toy was the music that plays each time the ferris wheel is turned (I felt it played a little too long, loud, and often--even though it is cute!). My husband solved that by unscrewing the bottom and cutting one of the wires that runs to it. Now the music just plays when the flower button on the front is pushed, and I consider it a practically perfect toy, and look forward to collecting more Weebles in the future!"
4,Great Buy!,"We bought this for our 1 year old, she absolutely loves it. It keeps her busy we also bought the Weebles camper and these are the only toys that keeps her attention span longer than 10 minutes."
4,LOUD!,"This is a good toy to actually play with, but suffers from two related problems:First, it is LOUD. There is no volume control whatsoever.Secondly, it is the sound activation is VERY sensitive. You look at it funny and it starts playing music. The ferris wheel on the side actives the music and it only takes a slight jostle to get it going.All told: a good, fun toy... but this will be one of the ""landmine"" toys you will find yourself desprately avoiding stepping near when crossing the living room after the kids are asleep."
4,Favorite Birthday present,"my son just turned two and I actually hesitated on buying this but wasn't sure what other toy to buy. Boy, am I glad I did from the second he opened it he has not stopped playing with it. This is one of the few toys that has kept his intrested. He even tryed to take it to bed with him. Before this I wasn't a big Weebles fan, but now they have my attention. Also, Toys r Us has the barn dance on half price in store, and I purchased it for $4.50. It was a nice addition to the tree house. Have fun."
2,Promising story ruined by weak ending,"Expatriate American teacher Evan Kendal and British doctor Addie Burwin find themselves involved and on the run from Addie's husband Paul, who has apparently been touched by some kind of evil that causes both physical and mental decay, as well as giving him the power to cause catastrophes. Back in Evan's hometown, something similar seems to have happened to Evan's uncle. All of this is presented effectively, which is what makes the conclusion such a disappointment. All of the various plot threads come together, but it all feels very arbitrary and sketchy. The final explanation for the supernatural goings-on is vague. Also, Mr. Grant does not write teenagers well; the grammar, vocabulary, and references in their conversation makes them all sound like people in their forties."
5,Great price and great product,"This hamper is available at several local stores including specialty baby stores in our area for a much higher price. It's sturdy, comes with different colored accent ties, and has a liner. For the price, you can't beat it."
1,Did not receive Product,"I'm unable to review product, but surely can say that Barry Farm is not the easiest place to work with. Perhaps it's just the Holiday jitters. Postal Service notified me they received empty package from the order I placed with them several weeks ago. I thought it'd be an easy matter to handle, but after not hearing back, I called Barry Farms, and was greeted with rudeness from person answering the phone. She told me I was talking over her as I tried to briefly explain the situation. Having paid only $2.69 for a product that cost $7.80 to ship, I was not satisfied with their customer service, and since the company told me this happens sometimes, perhaps they need to readjust their packaging methods."
4,"b.o.c.,s amazing debut from 72!!","this album began the interesting carreer of one of my favorite bands blue oyster cult. this album was the proverbial kick-off.from the unusual but very cool album cover to the catchy melodic hookish hard rock of the early 70,s sound one thing was clear..blue oyster cult had a unique approach to hard rock and a unique sound that no one else at the time really had.b.o.c has been compared to black sabbath as far as sound goes.i don,t think that comparison is a valid one.b.o.c and sabbath are both great bands but quite different in sound and song writing styles.many fans of the band think the first 3 albums were the best, i disagree i think alot of the later albums were equally good if not better.so for me the stand out tracks on this are;transmaniacon mc,then came the last days of may.stairway to the stars,workshop of telescopes and cities on flame with rock.n.roll. the bonus cuts are interesting. overall it is worth buying.so grab it!"
5,Blue Oyster Cult's Debut Is Great,"Blue Oyster Cult's self-titled debut album is great. Most of the songs are strong, and the playing is lighter than most heavy metal of the period. Both Eric Bloom and Donald ""Buck Dharma"" Roeser have excellent singing voices, with Roeser sounding a lot like John Lennon at times. ""Stairway To The Stars"" and ""Cities On Flame With Rock And Roll"" are this CD's best rockers, and the ballad ""Then Came The Last Days Of May"" is a cautionary tale of a drug deal gone wrong that inspired me to avoid anything stronger than ginger ale. This album is a must-own for anyone interested in rock music."
2,Waste of money,"My 2 year old danced around the chair as i attempted to load this corrupted disc on my computer. I have bought games from the discount bin ...that didn't mess my computer up the way this did. When i finally got it to load, it would freeze up constantly. My 2 year old played it and loved it, but was rightfully irritated by the constant freezing up. We enjoyed the Scholastic games much more."
2,Don't bother...,"I recently bought this for my 3-yr old grandaughter. While she loves Dora, I can see that she gets bored with it already. Not much choice here...Really disappointed in it. I have installed/uninstalled several times, but the sound is horrible. First, you need the volume up to hear the game, but then when the songs come on, the volume is way too loud. Also, the audio skips, freezes, etc. Save your money."
1,Disappointing Dora,"It's too bad that this title is nowhere near as good as the Nick Jr. TV show. It starts out nicely, but is short on content and gameplay and is very repetitive. The movies become dull, and children cannot click through them which caused alot of frustration."
2,Dora,Dora's backpack adventure was too easy. My three and a half year old completed level 2 in about 15-20 minutes. The third level is only harder because it the activities are in Spanish. She loves Dora but was bored with it the second time around.
2,Dora A+ CD Operation D-,"This is the second copy of this game I've had. My three year old granddaughter is quite the Dora fan.The first CD was apparently damaged....only the ""choice"" version worked...couldn't use the ""game"" half.So.....purchased a replacement. The characters are cute and charming but the movement from one game to another is very frustrating. Even the three year old thinks the computer has frozen while waiting for the next segment to appear. Pretty frustrating for a three year old...and the adult ""playing"" the game with her.Visually it's clever and enjoyable but the mechanics do not measure up.Except that if the child you are getting this for is a confirmed Dora fan, I wouldn't recommend it. The little Dora lovers are a tad more forgiving."
1,too boring for my 3 yr old,"My 3yr old son loves the Dora tv show, but quickly grew tired of this game. He finished his adventure within 20 minutes. The 3 difficulty levels are virtually the same and the activities are limited. The Reader Rabbit games offer a lot more fun for the money. This software is a waste."
2,Should have listened to the poor reviews,"Dora the Backpack is a disappointment on a technical level and interest level. One of the games (the Troll gmae) freezes the computer each time we reach it. Also, the game is generally boring, even with the level changes. Too bad!"
1,Didn't work,"I could never get this game to work on my computer, or the other infogrames Dora game (Lost City). It crashes as soon as I launch the game. I have never had trouble with any other game, and my computer meets all of the requirements. The tech support people tried all kinds of things but could not help me. This is very frustrating as my daughter was so excited when I brought the game home she kissed it.It does work on my work computer so sometimes I'll bring her there and let her play it. The game is OK, nothing really that isn't in the free nickjr.com online version."
1,good for 10 minutes of entertainment,My 3 year old completed the backpack adventure in 10 minutes. Then she completed the hardest setting in another 10 minutes. Now the game sits on the shelf and she won't touch it because it's way too easy even for a three year old. Save your money on this one.
2,Waste of Money,"I was so disappointed with this game. Originally when I hear a DORA game was coming out, I was very excited. I have a 3 year old girl who loves DORA. Unfortunatly, there is no variation to this game and little challenge. She was bored with it in less than 15 minutes because she had already completed the BACKPACK ADVENTURE. From there you can go to the MAP and roam free...there is only one adventure on this CD. I expected this game to be more entertaining and fun."
2,Average at best game; Dora only redeeming feature.,"Do not buy this game if you are used to the better quality games Humongous software has produced for NickJR characters in the past: Humongous was sold to Infogames, and well, if this title is indicative, much was lost.This game is saved only by the appearance of Dora. I really feel the two star rating is generous. My daughter is Dora crazy, and even she shows little to no interest in this game (and she loves edutainment computer games).The program is not well executed, and there is little asttention to detail. One my daughter noticed was that at the begining of the game Dora collects 5 books to return to the liebrary. When she returns the books at the end of the journey, the colors of the books which come out of the backpack don't match the ones put in, prompting my daughter to ask ""what happened to the books we put in Dora's backpack..."
2,"Look, I am all done.","The overall design is great but there is only about 20 minutes of playtime. The game is very much like a TV show, you watched it and it's over."
3,Dora's PC Games - Animal and Backpack Adventures,"I bought Dora's animal adv (using Win2000) for my 2.5 yr old and he loves it. At first it was kinda hard for him. But he mastered it. Now at 3 yrs, he loves to play with it with no help. There are good memory game, fun facts, numbers. Lotsa activites. I rate this one a 5 star for fun, educational and overall. Worth getting.BUT then I bought Dora's Backpack adv (using Win98) and there were so many problems with it. The trio came on very slowly. The game exited itself or froze up while playing. I'm not sure if it's b/c of Win98. The game itself is okay if there are so many bugs in the game. I rated this one a 3 stars for fun but 1 star for too many bugs."
1,Defective,"Beware of purchasing if you have an iMac - the software DOES NOT function properly. We have now purchased two copies, at two separate stores (including Amazon), with the same result. When signing in, the game does not properly recognize the letters to spell your child's name. When you click on "" M "", it states ""S"" - when you click on ""A"", it states ""F"". My daughters name ended up being spelled SFMMT. (Her name is Maddy) Then, when clicking, the software takens 2-3 minutes to move from one screen to another, and last but not least, shuts down without warning. This product needs to be recalled, not purchased. STAY AWAY!"
4,Pokey pokey,"It's pointy, it's sharp, it does the job, and it doesn't get rusty. This has been my boot knife for years, I lost one and replaced it with the same model. Good stuff."
2,Not good for saltwater,"I thought this was a dive knife, so I purchased one a couple weeks ago , after my first dive there was rust all over it. I would have never bought it if I thought it would rust, who wants a rusty knife? It did perform well as far as spearfishing goes though. Would not recommend to a diver, unless you want to look like an idiot in front of other spearfishermen with your old rusty dive knife that looks like something you found in a ditch."
5,Kershaw Amphibian Dive Knife,"This is a great knife. Perfect. Strong, lightweight, nice shape. The knife holster is below average, but the knife is so good you forget about the sheath."
4,Knife Review,"This product is pretty good. The knife is awesome. It's very sturdy and well sharpened, not to mention it just looks amazing. However, I do not like the sheath; it's extremely uncomfortable. So the knife is good but the sheath sucks."
4,Bought for other reasons but is my current dive knife,"So overall has been a great knife, came out of the box sharp as hell like all my other kershaws, but this was almost 8 years ago, maybe the quality has gone downhill a little bit since then, the sheath was okay then, but now its ""locking"" well holding feature has worn out, every once and a while i take a lighter to the kydex to bend it back it a holding position. I use this as my current dive knife, i wont attach to a bc easily and im not much for having it on my leg, cause its not an easily accesible position if i were to get entangled in something. after my sixth dive i noticed some rusting on it, that was with salt water mostly, since then i have cleaned it up, rinse w/ fresh water like all my other gear, and i spray a little silicone on it before i put it back in its sheath. and ive seen no rusting since.(BTW - a star because of no lock feature on the sheath. Like others biggest drawback)"
3,so-so,"It is not a dive knife. The sheath is ok. It does lock the blade in place, I have carried it quite a bit over the last 3-6 months and never had a problem with it coming loose. It is uncomfortable however. The sheath is made to clip onto a belt, or on the reverse side slide over a belt. This means there is a protrusion on either side and does not lay flat against a leg or hip. The blade is perhaps a 6-7 of 10 on sharpness. The handle is pretty thin, which is good for the style but not comfortable to use. The guard makes me a little nervous with a double edged knife."
3,cool knife but no uses,The Amphibian made by Kershaw is a small double edged knife with a partial serration and kydex sheath. The knife is light weight and razor sharp. The kydex sheath easily attaches to your belt the only problem is the knife rattles constanly when on the move. Since the knife is double edged it is impossible to brace your thumb on the spine of the blade for more precise cutting. That being said if you did end up falling in love with it you would be unable to EDC carry it as it is technically a dagger [this is true for Texas it might be different in other states lookk up your states knife laws to find out]. Long story short it is a cool little knife but i've never used it and would recommend it only as a collectible.
2,Not as I expected,"The Chieftains are known for their rowdy, spirited Celtic music. Most of the music on this CD was quieting, dirge-like and disappointing to the expectation of the ""spirited"" music I could pound my knees and legs, get up and dance with.....Too many other artists to enjoy just the Chieftains. I'm wondering who puts these 'favorites' together."
5,Wow.,"Like at first I thought this CD would be lame because it was my dad's CD.But I was sooooo wrong!This CD is brilliant!The instruments are played very well and the voices are great.Some songs are energetic and others are slow.Either beat,both are good.I love irish type music and if you enjoy this type of music,you'll really like this!"
5,Searching for a song?,"I'm looking for the song that was song at the time of J.F Kennedy Jr. memorial, I believe I heard it on the Today show with Katie Curic. I hope you will know what it is or where I can go...."
3,"to ""searching for a song""","The song that was played on TV at the time of JFK jrs funeral ( they said it was one of his favorites) was ""Carrickfergus"" and it's on the album ""Irish Heartbeat"" by Van Morrison and the Chieftains. Hope this helps. If you can, let me know if you see this."
5,"Delightful, fun read","A most delightful fast-reading book about life in a small town called Harmony, because that is what they aspired for. Written by a Quaker minister about a Quaker pastor. Many charming and interesting characters, uplifting little nuggets of wisdom at ends of chapters. Beautifully written, funny, clean, spiritual at times and entertaining throughout. I am glad its a series because I hope to enjoy more of these. They are homespun tales of people mostly in his parish--some lovable, sweet good people, and some you wish would move away! ""Reminds you to savor ordinary moments of life and to treasure sacred things like family, friends, and faith."" (quoting Alice Gray--a reviewer)."
3,Less funny and charming than I had hoped,"I read excepts and was excited by the gentle humor of the author. However, the stories didn't coalesce into a spiritually meaningful plot. They were funny and heartwarming but not moving."
5,Home to Harmony,"This is a wonderful lighthearted book. It is fun to read, and just right after a hard day, when you need some good laughs and relaxation. I would definitely recommend it."
3,Home to Harmony,"Phillip Gulley's Harmony Series is well-written with entertaining situations and plausible resolutions. Be prepared to be offended, however, if you are a religious conservative. The most obnoxious characters are so-called ""fundamentalists."" Unlike the other characters who have forgivable foibles, the evangelical Christians are portrayed with no redeeming qualities. As the Harmony book series progresses, the derision increases. Anyone who leans to the right politically is also portrayed as biased, close-minded, and unenlightened. If you share Gulley's religious and political views, you will love these books."
4,Not what I expected,"I thought this book would be more like the Mitford series. It isn't. But that's not a bad thing. This book is more like Tom Bodette's essays - short vignettes that illustrate something to think about in the days ahead, told with wisdom and humor. Not as pushy as Garrison Keillor, not as pithy as some of the others, just plain folk and things that everyone can relate to. I'm considering getting this for My Dad The Pastor."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I voted against this book for a book club discussion. I have to go this month and admit I was wrong to do so. The story primarily hangs on the strength of the personalities that compose a small town's Quaker church. Anyone of any church who has served on committees, in leadership positions, or frequently networks with others in formal organizations should find the stories amusing and fun. Great selection for someone needing ""light"" reading material because of illnesses or stresses. I will be passing this book along to my mother and others in the family. Can't wait to read the Christmas one."
3,Pleasant debut novel,"Harmony, Ohio, is the home of Sam Gardner, the pastor of The Harmony Friends Meeting. As the narrator of the book, Sam's gentle humor pervades throughout with his wry observations about members of his church. Each chapter is like a short story in which a humorous person or event is described. Despite the humor, this would have been a better book if the characters and situations had been developed a little more fully. Philip Gulley began as a short story writer and he continues in that genre despite this being a ""novel"". I also would have liked to gain more insight into the worship practices of the Quakers, but didn't really feel that I learned much about this religion by reading this book."
2,Anything But Harmony,"Please, please, please don't compare this author to Jan Karon; well, other than small town and some scripture, anyway. Mitford's warmth, charm, characters, jokes are so much fuller and make you want to visit on a regular basis. I just wanted to drive through Harmony and never look back. Back-biting, spineless, hateful...I passed it along with a disclaimer because I don't like to keep books from friends just because I don't like them."
2,Harmony ain't Mitford,"Having just finished this book I can safely say that Jan Karon has nothing to fear. This book was funny, at times poignant, but somehow lacks heart and soul. While not a devoutly Christian person, I felt a certain satisfaction after each of the Mitford books, plus a genuine affection for the characters. Most of Gulley's characters left me flat, I do not care about them, and to me that's a fatal flaw in a book."
2,FICTIONALIZED :FACTS,"A friend, knowing my interest in America's Presidents, brought me a copy of page 64, thinking I would be interested in it. I was. . . in all of the errors! I found at least 7 errors of fact on that one page about Vice-President Wheeler. I know nothing of the rest of the book, and hope this is definitely advertised as fiction. Even so, I would think a little more attention to historical facts would be worth the author's time.Del Hambley"
4,Slap in the face,"If you have been wading about in the spiritual path, and got a thought into your head that one day you might be sitting under a tree, and all at once the Truth will be revealed, and you will be doused in holy light, and forever have a saintly smile etched on your face, and will commune with the spirit, and recognise your true self, your face before your parents begot you...Then this book is indeed for you, coz it will slap you back into your senses. To quote from the book ""You are your own worst enemy. Ram Tzu is your friend, so he will have to kill you to save you from yourself."""
3,humor? more emptyness.,"simply admonishes your foolishness for seeking...If you need such, then this book is for you. It's intended as a joke, so take it as such."
2,No way (actually) for the Spiritually Advanced,"sometimes cute, and always pretentious, if you've breathed air on your own, you don't need this book, Ram Tzu could certainly learn more from you. But it does, in a childish way, present some basics for those new on the path..."
2,"OOPS, wrong country","This book was written for plant life in ENGLAND, not the USA. That is a marked climate difference, generally cooler to colder and a bit wetter than much of the USA. Plus the US has a greater range of climates than many countries (being the 3rd largest nation, area wise, on earth). This is a very nice book, but I'd NOT recommend it for USA gardeners."
5,Bravo!,"This is a wonderful small cook book of only biscotti recipes. I have one for myself and have given three as gifts. My Sicilian mom always asks me to bring the ""Tuscan"" biscotti (from page 13) to holiday dinners at her house. I tried one of the chocolate versions made by my neighbor who also owns the book and they were outstanding. For ten dollars you get a great varitey of recipes which are easy, and don't call for ingredients which are too fancy or hard to find."
4,Great variety,This book was recommended by an Italian friend who gave me my first lesson in basic biscotti-making. The variety of ingredients in the recipes has me anxious to try them once I master the dough handling and double baking.
1,not the best book,"Not the best book, wish I had checked it out at the book store first I wouldn't have ordered it."
3,Biscotti recipes,"I tried a couple of recipes and the taste was good, but the mixture would fall apart when cutting after the 1st bake. I added an additional egg and it seemed to help a lot. Next time around, I would increase the amount of flour and reduce the amount of butter to help the consistency and make it more chewy and less crumbly. I will continue to try other recipes.Thank you.Curt"
5,An in-depth and practial review of the human engineering,"Kiba's book on bathrooms is one of them best studies of human needs and how to accommodate them that has been written in recent years. He begins with a look into how bodies actually work, not what people assume. He delves into basic of people's feelings about their body processes. He studies the design of plumbing fixtures and proposes changes that would reduce ""spray"" and improve sanitation. Plumbing for private homes and public facilities are both addressed. For anyone involved in the design and manufacture of fixtures, architecture or engineering of sanitary facilities, sales, or installation of sanitary waste facilities this book is a must read."
5,Scientific analysis of today's horrible bathroom facilities.,"Cornell University's Dr. Kira performs extensive scientific research on how humans use bathroom facilities, and discovers our current designs and practices are WRONG. For example, our sinks are much too low and our toilet seats are too high. Urinals are designed to splash on us(!), and women's restrooms would be much more useful if they still had female-friendly urinals (which they did until the 70's). Dr. Kira provides many new designs that solve the problems we tolerate out of ignorance.How could so much detailed research and beneficial new designs be overlooked? An Amazing book that is totally relevant today (humans are still the same, and so are toilets). It should NOT be out of print"
2,Fat Case for Fat PDA,"I bought this case several weeks ago and have only used it twice. It's big and bulky and makes it look like I'm carrying around a dishwasher, not a PDA.I've since found a better use for it. I use it store blankets and comforters. Slides easily under the bed."
2,Author Found What He was looking For,"This is a prime example of why scientists should follow the the Sientific Method. Instead of trying to disprove his belief, he found (interpeted) much to prove it. Although Europeans may well have been in North America before Leif Ericson, Barry Fell finds such ""evidence"" across the U.S.. Sometimes his ""finds"" elicit laughter."
4,Humidifier Filter,The humidifier pad seems to be working well. I had to remove the old one and remove deposits but it seems to be working as expected.
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"It's a humidifier pad. It works, does what it's supposed to do - but it comes coated with this powdery stuff that, I guess, is supposed to prevent deterioration and rust. It's really messy, and gets all over the place. Once you get past that, though, the pad lasts me for one or two seasons."
4,Filters Now,It is the required filter for my system and seems fine. I will search Filters Now for filter needs in the future.
5,IT fit,"It my furnace humidifier quite well . If the price is right, I would buy this filter again for sure."
4,Good filter,"easy to install, reasonably priced and was shipped in a very short period of time and arrived in good shape"
5,Arrived quickly and in perfect condition,"Ordered this for my GeneralAire Humidifier on my heating system. The product comes in a sealed plastic pouch, because the wicking material is coated with a compound to help the material hold and distribute water over the surface of the metallic wick. Open the pouch over a garbage can or your sink, as some of the powdery coating comes loose in shipping, and it is a little messy. Pre-rinse this item in cool tap water before installation into the humidifier housing. It will also be important to remove this item at the end of the heating/humidifying season, and clean up the wick tray and surrounding surfaces of the interior of the humidifier housing with a wet sponge. The coating compound breaks down after the heating season and can end up fouling your return air ducts if you do not remove it promptly. This is a procedure I have developed via trial and error over the last 6 years."
4,Humidifier Filter,"I bought three filters (pads) because I always forget to buy one in the fall to replace the old before winter dries everything out. The price was rights, so I stocked up. The only down side was that the box arrived damaged. The filters do not appear to be damaged, but they were not packed well (need to be individually wrapped inside the box)."
5,My daughter LOVES his album,"My 17 year old daughter discovered Frank Sinatra last year and fell in love. I told her she might like Harry Connick Jr. but she was sure there was no one, ""as good as Frank"". I gave her this album for Christmas and it has been on non-stop revolving play ever since."
4,This bought me to him,This is the first CD I borrowed from my friend way back when I was in the university. And it is this exact CD that brought me to start listen to Harry. Great CD!
5,His best yet!,Harry has out done himself again with this wonderful album. I know every song by memory and I have only had it for a week. Once you start listening to it you cant stop!Harry is a musical genius!
2,MFZH Doesnt live up to the Hype,"I am a huge Zebrahead fan, Ive seen them play twice and was probably the first person to get there new CD. Waste of time and Playmate of the year were awesome albums. Still today they are permanently in my changer. As for MFZB it lacks everything that zebrahead are, there wild and witty songs about off beat topics and really crazy sounds they made are totally gone off this album. They truly did ""sell out"" or did something really stupid. Zebrahead are a huge hit in japan, like blink 182 or some ragged pop star is in america. I can only imagine the dissappointment of a whole nation. Either way Zebrahead best bet is to get back in the studio (and fast) and tell everyone that martians abducted all of them and in place put in Godsmack, maybe they can save some face than and not sign there own tombstone!"
2,playmate and waste are far better,"Want to know what I think about this CD? IT MAKES ME SAD. Zebrahead are this amazing band I got into when I first heard ""Get Back"" off Waste of Mind. An amazing song...awesome CD. If you've never heard them, think extremely fast punk interlaced with funk, a dj, and two singers with opposing ways of singing...and lots and lots of tongue in cheek lyrics.Their follow-up, Playmate of the Year, did not disappoint either. It was fresh and fun, just like Waste of Mind.But this. THIS. This is music that you can pick up from Blink, New Found Glory, Simple Plan...all that crap they call punk rock nowadays. It's power chords, dull lyrics, no funk, no fun. All that I listed above in the previous cds...GONE. Is it an improvement? No...they've lost what made them special, and now aren't worth listening to, unless they change their act.I would however, highly recommend both old cds. Pick them up now if you haven't heard them."
4,Still zebrahead as always...,"Though the cd lacks humor, the songs are a culmination of their last two releases. I hated the first cd, except for ""someday"" which is my favorite Zebrahead song, and the whole second cd is also good. I think that this cd will grow on me the more I listen to it."
2,Pretty much trash.,"It seems as though this once orginal band has jumped on the ""punk"" bandwagon. They used to be a cross between funk and rap, with a tiny bit of punk. Now, if you listen to the CD, there is only 1 funk song, which isn't even that good. They're now 90% punk pop, with whiny pop punk lyrics and simple guitar riffs. Where are all of the crazy G solos now? Zebrahead went from a great orginal band to yet another punk band. I do NOT recommend. Bad choice, not worth your money."
4,the rock has been delivered,"I am only writing this because I see so many bad reviews for this cd....By far the best Zebrahead cd, and I liked the old stuff....I don't know how anyone thinks this is ""poppy"", they really stepped it up on this one, way less pop than playmate of the year for sure. If you like anything from Zebrahead but haven't heard this check it out and you will probably like it more."
2,Crappy Like Linkin Park,"There is a hardly anything good to say about this album. The first cd is even better, the songs just get annoying for the most part there are like two or three good songs and the rest are just crap like Rescue Me is. I wish they would go back to Playmate Of The Year."
1,waste of time,"It's difficult to believe that this is the same group that created Waste Of Mind. Like Incubus did with Make Yourself (after S.C.I.E.N.C.E failed to fully breakthough to the mainstream) Zebrahead completely dumbed down their sound on Playmate of the Year and now even further on Mfzb in an attempt to gain commercial success. Fortunately for anyone stuck listening to a radio they probably never will in America, simply because they sound like every other irrelavent wannabe pop-punk band crowding the airwaves. It's time for Zebrahead to remember what separated them from the pack in the first place- mainly an extraordinarily talented lead guitarist and a lyrically gifted rapper. This stripped down version just isn't worth the time."
1,Boring!,"Uggghhhh. I just can't possibly imagine why any old school zebrahead fans would actually like, or worse yet, love this album. I have followed Zebrahead since the late 90's, and this is by far the worst thing they have ever put out. Their early work had a hardcore vibe, Waste of Mind had a very funky sort of vibe, and Playmate of the Year blended pop and borrowed from electronica for many of the beats. Mzfb takes Zebrahead and turns them into a pop punk band with a rapper, maybe to buold upon the Sum 41 hit ""Fatlip"", or maybe for other reasons. But theres no way around the fact that this is just awful. Most of the songs are indistinguishable, and Zebrahead's trademark sense of humor is almost non-existant. The music is still fast and bouncy, but compared to what they've done before, the guitar work is mind numbingly simplistic and has been done by just about every other band in the pop-punk genre. Shame on all of you 4 and 5 star reviewers."
2,A dissapointment,"There was a lot of hype for MFZB, and all I have to say is WHAT FOR? This is probably their worst cd, the production is awfull, the songs are uncreative and just lame. Sopposedly they wrote 80+ songs for this CD, I'd hate to hear the songs that didn't make it. Zebrahead was my favorite band up until I heard this CD, now I am less of a fan. There is only one good song, ""Hello tomorrow"". Breakthough CD? I think not, sorry but maybe next time Zebrahead"
5,Wow.,"If you like their other stuff, you'll love this. Simple as that. It's better than the other two CDs (which I own and love).If you've never heard their stuff, I suggest downloading a few songs, and I'm sure you'll be hooked. I suggest: Rescue Me, Strength, Blur, and Type A.Awesome. Five stars."
5,"Best ""Undiscovererd"" Band Around","My friend turned me onto these guys way back when Waste of Mind was new and they've been my favorite band since! I can't believe they haven't hit the big time (In some ways, i'm glad since bands seem to get worse once they've been infected by TRL wretchedness) Anyway - ZH has this energy that can't be described - you NEED to hear the vocal interactions and infectious rythms they produce. MFZB, their latest, continues this style with more of a hard edge than before. You won't find the bouncing easy going sound of ""Move On"" or ""I'm Money"" - more of the ""Get Back"" sound here. That said, it's great new stuff. Listen to ""Hellow Tomorrow"" one time and tell me you don't want to just hit repeat and rock on. Buy MFZB and feel good about being in the know!"
3,WHAT HAPPENED TO WASTE OF MIND!?!?!,"I would like to know what has happened to the Zebrahead that made Waste of Mind? Waste of Mind shows that there was a lot of time and effort put into the album. MFZB shows anything but. If you are into pop-punk at its fastest pace, then MFZB is for you. With similar chord progressions and licks for each song, it is hard to wonder what exactly has happened to this band. Now, I am not saying that Zebrahead isn't allowed to evolve musically, every band can do whatever they want whenever they want. But, let's face it, the melting pot of musical influences in Waste of Mind is no longer apparent in this new album, showing a step down in musical tastes. There are no longer any jazz or funk bass rhythms, disco inspired tracks or fast-paced guitar solos. I miss the old zebrahead and this album only makes it worse..."
2,A Little Dissapointed,"I have to dissagree with some of the previous ratings. I was a much bigger fan of their earlier released stuff, they went to a much more ""pop-punk"" sound. If that's your style, definately pick up the album, but if you were into the uniqueness of previous material you may be let down. To each their own, surely give it a listen, but you may want to check out some tracks or clips before buying. I got it for 3 dollars so really I can't complain but I figured I'd throw out my input."
1,I wish I could install this so I could see what it is about.,"Amazon.com listed that this game would work with Windows 95. After many failed attempts to install it, I read on the packaging that it only would work with Windows 98, and above. How can we review it, if we can't even install it. Ordering online it is very important that all system information is correct. This wasn't. Too bad, my son will miss not being able to play Thomas as promissed."
1,Is that it?,"As others have mentioned, there really isnt a lot here. Despite the appeal of the Thomas characters, my 2 1/2 year-old was bored very quickly.We also have a very well-worn copy of Thomas and the Great Festival Adventure, which actually has puzzles and seems to teach something other than just mouse skills. I was expecting something of at least that quality as was very disappointed.Also I should mention that whilst the interminable instructions are being recited, the mouse cursor is hidden. This caused a great deal of confusion as my son couldn't work out why the mouse wasn't working all of a sudden.In short, a regrettable purchase (I will check the reviews next time!)"
1,marc,"this product stinks! First of all,it only worked when it felt like it and then when I updated my computer,the tool bar told me that the operating software was too old to be compatible with my mac! They are selling software from the early 2000's around 2002 or so....don't buy it,you'll have to buy a real old computer for it to work or better yet,just return it! Its a waste of cash!"
5,Building a New Line,My son has hours of fun with this game. The price and shipping costs were great and it arrived just in time for Christmas. I was quite pleased.
2,Would be better if it would stop talking,"Attention to all makers of children's computer games: please, please, PLEASE do not make games where there a long, dull instructions that cannot be skipped. This would have been an 'ok' game if it weren't for the directions that are repeated every single time you play the game. Maybe there is a way to skip past the directions, but I haven't found it yet. The kids I work with get annoyed and lose interest by the time the directions for each new activity are repeated."
4,"Guidebook for clinicians is terrific for parents, too.","Russell Barkley's book starting with the title ""Defiant Children"" is, I think, very misleading for potential readers. During my years of working with parents in my psychology practice, I often recommended this book to parents to help them to understand better how to use behavioral change methods with their children, some of whom were difficult children, some were normal active children, and in some cases, the parents just lacked the knowledge. Well written and strikingly devoid of ""psychobabble"", the author gives a clear, simple explanation of how to use point systems effectively and is especially good at pointing out to parents the importance of their attitude and behavior toward the child during their training. It is the kind of book that parents want to keep around for referral for many years after they have learned to deal with and help their children learn how to learn positive, productive ways of interacting with other people."
1,Warrior,"I have viewed this tape and having been in both combat and having been in law enforcement for over 20 years, the techniques which Mr. DeHook show in this tape DO NOT work against a determined aggressive attacker. I am especially appalled at the knife defense. Should anymore, let alone a woman attempt to defend herself against a knife attack the way it is shown, she will die. I say this as I have studied the art of knife fighting and knife defense for the past 12 years. The basic information is okay, and if someone is buying this tape for the statistics and information only, then its okay. However if anyone feels that these techniques will save them against an aggressive attacker, then they are living on a myth. Mr. DeHook may have been a police trainer, but never in teaching officers how to defend themselves. If you want to buy a tape on self-defense for women, get Mellissa Soalt's Fierce and Female. She is at least credible!"
2,"Not ""Pure"" Aloe","Although this product is titled ""Pure Aloe Vera Gel"", it isn't. It's got the usual stuff in it - yellow dye #5, thickeners, etc. Aubrey makes a true pure Aloe product."
1,LOTS OF CHEMICALS!!!,"Smells like chemicals the second you open it! I should have looked harder at this product before purchase! FAR from ""Pure"" Aloe! I would never put this on my skin!Complete ingredients: Aloe Vera Gel, Sodium Acrylates/C10-30, Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polysorbate 20, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA, Benzophenone-4,, FD&C; Yellow #5, FD&C; Blue #1, Methlychloroisothiazolinone, Methlisothiazolinone."
3,Dont last very long,"The sticks look very good, they sound very good on my drumset, but after a week or two of medium use one of the sticks bent."
5,Outstanding!,"I've been buying these carob chips for years. No other chips compare. These are just the right amount of sweetness & mimic chocolate! They're great for baking in place of choc chips but also good to at by themselves, out of the bag! Also, the customer service is great, the folks at Barry Farms are awesome!"
1,Old chips,"The dark chocolate chips came flaked with white discoloration. This is usually a sign of an old product. The weather was cold,so it wasn't due to heat. I would return it, but the site says it is not returnable. Don't by these chips from this vendor."
3,how to use,Dosent come with fluid insted it has cotton inside it. all you need to do is get lighter fluid and get the cotton wet.
4,A darkly humorous look at a man who regresses to infancy.,"In Tantrum, a middle-aged man grows tired of the pressure of his life and spontaneously rejuvenates into a two-year-old. Feiffer gives a humorous but sometimes uneven look at the misadventures that follow. Some of the story is realistic (eg., the man's family take the infant to a doctor, who proclaims that ""this is a normal, healthy two-year-old"" and chastises the family for wasting his time), while other parts are fantastic (the man-infant, out on his own [?] happens into a convention of other regressed adults and has to pretend he is a simple two-year-old to escape them). Some of the book does not bear close scrutiny -- such as why a person who looked and dressed like a baby would be allowed to travel freely like an adult -- but is overall an enjoyable and thought-provoking work."
3,"An OK book, but somewhat uninspiring at times","I liked this book, but it was a middle-ground presentation of the genre. If you want a good read, this is one for you. If you want deep quality writing without too many common tropes and innovative plot? Not this one."
3,To expensive,"The of the Lionel FasTrack O72 22.5 Degree Curved Track Section - 612041 over $14.00 is very costly, as compared to M.B. Klien's price of $4.89 ea. I was highly disappointed when I learned of this after the purchase at your cost."
5,Oustanding!,"Olanda Draper and the Associates have rendered quality and clarity in their music since thier inseption, This Cd is testiment to thier legacy"
5,Raising Cane,I think if you have boys every mom needs to watch this!!!!! This is amazing video that shows that there is nothing wrong with active boys. I have loaned it out several times and watched it over and over again. Please Please Buy this it will truly open your eyes to a lot of things about raising kids
3,Good But With Flaws,"Important with a few flaws. Regarding the Snow White Rape Scene: First of all, they talk about these boys being shocked that people would be offended by this. Does it trouble anyone else that rape and violence against women has been totally de-sensitized in the eyes of American boys? Of course seeing a mock rape scene would be upsetting! Yikes. Second of all, allowing these boys to have their mock rape scene sends the message that rape is ok to their fellow students. Rape is a huge problem even in wealthy communities in America. The documentary began to touch on how boys are taught to sexualize women and view them as the other but didn't complete the dialogue. I'm disappointed this was not delved into deeper."
4,Great book!,"This book was definitly the type you can't put down. Once you start reading, you can't stop. It brings you into ancient Persia and teaches you about the different rituals, cultures and religions in the most entertaining shape historical fiction can take.The only problem I had was that the supporting characters seemed to lack any life of their own or purpose other than to serve as contrasts or compliments of Esther.Other than that, if you like historical fiction, biblical fiction, or any book with an emphasis on religion, I recommend this."
3,ESTHER,This book was okay. was detailed could of being better. not one of my favourite Esther books. The author could of done a better job should of made the king more of a man then a woman.
2,There's better historical fiction than this...,"This was one of the worst biblical come fiction books I've read. I usually really enjoy this genre, but never before have I been subjected to such an over-romanticized, milk and honey bunch of hooey. According to this book, Esther's was a life of joy from almost beginning to end. She's faced with a few sorrows here and there, but for the most part she joins a harem where she is lavishly treated almost from day one. Most harems were not the place of luxury and pampering portrayed in this book. Basically, I give the book one star for historical reality and two stars for readability. Really, if you like this genre, go out and get yourself some really good reading like ""The Red Tent"" and Orson Scott Card's ""Women Of Genesis"" series. This book really isn't worth your time unless you're just looking for a basic beach book."
5,Listen To Tommorow,"Very short review. Musically as good as it gets. Sonically This is As State Of The Art as you can hear. This recording is the reason many of us Audiophiles spend so much money on this hobby. This recording and all the AIX albums deserve the title of THE BEST RECORDED SOUND ON DVD AUDIO. With the right equipment, you will hear what many of us have been waiting for. MUSICAL Truth,your living room is now a true Concert Hall."
4,Satisfied,"The watch is nice and seems very durable. However, I wish I would have know the dimensions and not for sure if it is water proof, but I do like! I will be purchasing another Relic watch in the very near future."
5,this was off the hook!!!!,"i've been a fan of IIG's for a long time and this album immediately comes out strong with Watch, Pray, Live Holy. What's great about these guys is that they a real clever with the lyrics and blow you away with the bumpin' beat. I especially like Bad Company, that comparison of Samson and Delilah in the club had me rollin' on the floor. ""Went to sleep with braids, but woke up with a fade."" And I do agree tik and chill come wit it nicely but Solo just stands out more it seems to come easier to him."
4,The Exodus,How can I be unbias reviewing this CD?I can't so I won't be. If your a christian as I am and you enjoy rap (Snoop Dogg...etc) you'll be surprised at the production value as well as skills the gangstaz have been blessed with. something that caught me off guard was their ability to preach the word of Jesus and not really preach. make sense? didn't think so...heres what i'm talking about the whole album is full of life experiences and what their worlds where without Christ and then what happened to their life with JC. it's very refreshing to see a group not affraid to be real (christian or not). the gangstaz do just this on the exodus. my advice and this is only advice..buy the CD...
5,FABULOUS!,"this book is an archival wonder. the author brings us into intimate contact with the potters of a generation past. production, studio, and industrial potters alike should read and absorb the severe trials these men(and women)had to go through to make a living during a time when living wasn`t gauranteed. details such as kiln construction workshop layout and techniques make this book intresting for anyone involved in the pottery field. give it ten stars!!!"
5,A Must,"For anyone who has any interest in pottery this is a ""must read"" and this also incudes whoever may have an interest in US History."
5,What happened to the Farmers's Wife?,If this documentary did'nt scare you 11 years ago it should terrify you now. I remember watching it then and just finished a second veiwing tonight. If you dont think our goverment is out of control set back in you're chair watch this and see the events that Juanita predicted in 98 that now have come to be. What a great play of human life in REAL TIME!
5,"Overwhelming Strength,Love and Hope.","My wife and I watched the Farmers Wife when it first aired on PBS. The strength this couple has is overwhelming.They showed raw,honest emotion that had us glued to our set for 3 nights. At the end of the film you feel as if you know these people and want to know them forever. If you have ever fallen upon hard times,true hard times,this film will give you hope that love,hard work and faith will pull you through.I bought The Farmers Wife(VHS) for my wife's birthday this year and it will be something that we will share with our families and friends.We will cheerish it and watch it often,because in it's own way it gives us a little more strength than we had before we sat down to watch it.Any hard working family man or woman will love and respect this wonderful film."
5,Poetic story of real life drama,"This is the real 'Real World' documentary. The documentary shows true to life struggles of a young farm family trying to make it through rough times. The first time I watched this was on PBS when I was first married. I just purchased the dvd after something made me remember how much the story touched me. Watching it as a wife with plenty of life/marriage experiences I felt that I viewed the story from a different perspective. It's a great portrayal and I would love to know how the family is doing now, ten years later."
5,"Love, Hope, and Perseverance","The plight of the small farmer is not fully recognized by those people who are not directly involved. This film is the best way to relate to the joys, and struggles of small farming.No one who watches this film will pass a farm, and look at it in the same way as before. And they will never forget Juanita and Darrel. Never! Hopefully, they will also want to then read the statistics on the Farm Aid Website, and get involved before it is too late."
4,This is the best book I've read on this subject.,"I highly recommend this book. It has many interesting facts with lots of New Testament translation errors, ambiguities and factual information. I also liked the chapter, ""How The Universe Really Works"". Really interesting! The chapter on ""Dinner With the Christian Fundamentalists"" was also informative and even funny. This is an easy to read book. Concise. Intriguing. Informative. Full of introductory and advanced information. It even has a chapter on Aramaic and Greek translation errors. This may sound boring, but Cayce presents the information in an easy to read and intelligent manner. The only complaint I have is that I wanted more. But that's the sign of good book. Isn't it? I'm actually starting to read the book a second time and I'm discovering some things I missed the first time. Good stuff!"
2,Off topic,"The idea that the historical Jesus differs from the post Easter Jesus presented to the world by the early church is well documented. This book tends to rant too much about John and Paul, without getting into the scholarship. When he does get into some of the scholarship he gets it wrong. For example the author states that Matthew is the most accurate gospel. No one gospel is any more or less accurate. Mark is the first gospel and influenced Matthew and Luke. The author misses a very important fact about John's gospel,that it is written as a defense of the faith against the gospel of Thomas. The blend of physics, faith and karma at the end of the book is dubious at best. It just another spin on things that someone pulled out of his...well, you get the idea. On the postive side anything that pokes at the scourge of fundamentalism deserves some praise."
5,Very interesting. I really enjoyed reading this book.,"This book was really interesting. I enjoyed reading it.I initially ordered the e-book, but decided to order the paperback to pass along to several of my Born Again Christian friends who are always trying to persuade me to become ""saved"" and to join their Assemblies of God Church.My Christian Fundamentalist friends now sheepishly look at me and are even a little bit dumbfounded since they know they can't answer my questions. They now eventually just tell me that I ""just have to have the faith.""My thanks to the author for providing me with interesting and legitimate questions for my Born Again Christian friends. They no longer try to convert me as they used to, and I always feel like I have the last word with them now.The book has also given me a new respect and interest in Jesus the man. Bottom line, what Jesus taught and what Christianity has been teaching is not always the same."
2,Information seems accurate - needed an editor,"I bought this book based on a radio interview with the author as well as the positive Amazon reviews. The book does cover much of the material I expected it to, and it seems accurate and well documented. But I was very disappointed with the quality of the writing. Mr. Cayce seems to have a hard time sticking to one subject at a time. Instead he changes topics regularly, often repeating points he has made previously. While each of the sentence are generally tight and coherent, they are put together in some pretty disjointed paragraphs and so the end result seems sloppy."
4,A very intersting book.,"I really liked this book. A friend of mine recommended it and I'm glad she did. I started reading it and when finished, I liked it so much that I read it again. Many interesting things that I had not known. Definitely worth the read. Jesus comes through with a fresh perspective. I especially liked the final Addendum chapter of ""How Everything In the Universe Really Works."" An interesting mingling of science, philosophy, and religion."
4,An interesting book,"I've had a few friends who became Born Again Christians. Unfortunately they've been trying to convert me as well. I've got nothing against Born Again Jesus people. I actually have a lot of respect for the individual called Jesus. Just leave me out of this born again stuff.This book gave me just the right bit of information to keep my overzealous Christian friends at bay. After reading this book, I now also understand why my friends are so fanatical about converting me. Fortunately, they now tend to leave me alone since they don't have answers to my questions (questions that I got from Cayce's book). Thanks for the information Mr. Cayce.This book is actually quite good and is different from other books of this genre in that it is less about boring biblical analysis and more about 'What To Say To A Born Again Christian Fundamentalist, But Never Had The Information.'"
5,Truly Awesome CD!!!,"I already own all the Romances CD's so I was a bit skeptical about buying Luis Miguel's Greatest Hits CD because many of the songs I already have. However, after thinking about it for a couple of weeks I went ahead and bought it anyway because the track list looked great. I have to say that I am beyond impressed with the quality of this CD. The old songs must have been re-mastered because they all sound amazing, the production is impeccable and the choice of songs couldn't be any better. It has quickly become my favorite CD and I've been listening to it over and over again.If you like Luis Miguel this CD is a MUST and if you are looking to buy one of his records for the first time, this is certainly the one to get, satisfaction guaranteed!"
3,Prefer Romances,Kuis Miguel is one of my favourite singers. A number of the songs on these two CD's are very good but I guess I prefer the ballads from his ROMANCES days.
1,so in ordewr to hear si te perdieras,"you have to buy this 2 cd set,there is only 1 other song on this 2 cd set that is good, but its an old song on another release..looks like i will have to hear si te perderias on youtube.but what a song!!wow!but i'll skip buying a 2 cd just for 1 song.me entiende?"
4,Green Hornet Strikes Again!,"The company known as Video Treasures has done it. They have successfully raised a film from the dead A long, long, time ago a list was published called ""The Lost Sound Serials"" GHSA was one of them. There was no hope to ever see this story again, until Anchor Bay makes a fine print brought fromk Universals original film negatives. As for the movie, it's good but not great. Warren Hull brings more dignity to the role of GH. Keye Luke is a passable Kato, but expect no Bruce Lee, Kato rarley gets into a fight. The story is full of action, adventure and heart stopping cliffhangers. It's great fun for children and adults."
1,beatles disappointment.,Very unhappy with this. Won't play on regularly formated DVD. Why bother . Save your money. Maybe some day some one will do this up right. I don't wast to have to sit at my computer to rock out. .
5,"Away From Here's ""Anatomy of a Broken Heart""",I'd definitely buy this cd if I were you. They're an awesome band with a range of genres including emo and screamo. I love all of their songs and so will you. :) <33
5,I am suprised to see this on the US amazon,"I moved from Saskatchewan to Chicago a few years ago and I had the pleasure of learning about this awesome band. When I googled them a while back to see if I could get ahold of another one of their CDs for a friend I was happy to see I could get it right here in the US!It is a great Screamo CD, the sound quality isn't perfect... but what do you expect, it was made in Regina. The band has a lot of talent... poison arrows is my favorite track."
5,A book worth revisiting time and time again.,"Dr. Joe Rubino's book is incredibly insightful from the beginning to the end. Dr. Rubino explains why it is SO important to create a strong, well-defined vision to keep you motivated everyday. The prospecting portion of the book is informative and should be a book all its own. The book covers a wide spectrum from warm market to trade show marketing. Dr. Rubino shows you a simple and easy way to describe the idea of network marketing and exactly how it works. One thing that I learned from the book is how important it is to really listen to and learn from what your prospect is saying. Dr. Rubino explains that by doing this you will be able to bring value to your prospects life by listening to and learning what the prospect wants and showing them a way to get it."
4,Good step-by-step book to recruiting marketing prospects,"I read this book thinking that it would be a well-rounded book that has a system to building a strong base for the network marketing products AND opportunity. This book was excellent at describing how to build a strong base among opportunity seekers/brokers. However, the author flat out says that he believes the overwhelming majority of your network marketing cash will come from other brokers. I was glad he said that at the beginning, because I knew what to expect in the rest of the book. However, I have a network marketing business, and most of my business comes from the product. I wish he outlined how to continue to build upon that base. But at the same time, I was definitely more interested in attracting brokers. If you're only interested in marketing the opportunity, this book is absolutely perfect for you. If you're interested in marketing the products, you'd be better off looking elsewhere."
5,Incredible Insight.,"It doesn't matter if you are new to Network Marketing, or a seasoned pro, Dr. Rubinos book is a must. I have read it through several times and am applying what he says. There is no fluff and he knows his business. I certainly think this should be your next purchase if you are serious about building an incredible business. He takes the concerns out of the business that have been tagged to it over the years. It has helped my Network Marketing business in a big way. Thank You Joe! Doug Marshall www.dougexeseries.com"
4,A book every networker should read!,"If you're serious about being sueccessful in network marketing, this book is a must read. Dr. Joe pulls all the aspects of personal and business development together to help both newcomers and experienced networkers alike learn the skills that will move them forward. Every chapter has golden nuggets. It's a book that I have recommended to everyone on my team. If you want to excel, look at other's success and the notes they have left behind to guide you to the top. This is a book that you will read over and over.Peter Wright"
2,Not what the picture said it was.,The flag is made of good materials but its not what the picture said it was. The dragon on my flag is blue and it is a lot less cool. I wish it was the right color but it is still a good flag.
3,need to buy bigger.,"you have to choose 2 size up than you think.size S is just for children (less than 10 years!!) M is for girls...i bought M and have to change it for XXL.the quality is amazing, good price, good fit, and nice."
5,Unusual and outstanding !,A brilliant portrayal of how a fanatics mind might work. A mind-numbing story of what it might truly feel like to lose your freedom in the blink of an eye.As a short novel this book suceeds on every level and leaves the reader wishing for more.
2,Meh,Interesting premise for the kidnapping but all in all a dull tale with segments seemingly only written for shock value.
2,Hunt wasn't given a chance to thrive in this one,"I don't know about this one. Fairly good story, but thin in many areas. The main character is Wyatt Hunt a former military inspector and former child protective services field agent turned PI. Definitely not of the traditional gumshoe mold -- he's a bit too self aware with some scars from the past left by growing up in the foster care system and later losing his fiance. I really wanted to like this guy, but I don't think Lescroart developed his character well enough or allowed for a rich enough story line for him to grow on me. He did a far better job with the other characters in the book like Hunt's friends Amy Wu and Devin Juhle. But maybe Hunt grew on my just enough, because I do think that I'd give a ""Hunt"" novel another chance. Just to see where Lescroart can redeem him."
3,a decent read,"To me this was not the strongest Lescroart book I have read. I donot think that this was his best effort because the plot did not seem to be as strong to me as others I have read of his work. However it still is a decent read for mystery and suspense fans.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,"Okay, but I'll take Dismas Hardy anytime!","John Lescroart is an excellent author. He's very good at setting a mood or a scene, and let you feel as though you're there with the characters. It was the same in this novel, but I just never felt connected with the story, or the new cast of characters, some of which are also side characters in many of the Dismas Hardy/Abe Glitzky novels.Read this novel if for no other reason than to keep tabs on some of Lescroarts other main characters. Otherwise, can't wait for Lescroarts next novel."
4,Always Entertaining,Lescroart's books are always entertaining reads. Although this novel has new characters (I really missed Dismas and Glitzsky) his new character was fun to get acquainted with and I hope we will be hearing more of him in future books. Maybe Dismas Hardy can hire a new PI to work with and help Glitzsky to solve more crimes. Great book if you can't sleep on an airplane!
5,Vanishings and a San Francisco crime wave,"John Lescroart's THE HUNT CLUB receives Guerin Barry's warm and quietly dramatic style as it tells of a federal judge's murder, a crime wave in San Francisco, and the disappearance of others who have a connection to the judge. A beautiful woman becomes the suspect until she vanishes too, involving Wyatt in the chase of his life."
2,First time for this author,"A friend recommended John Lescroart's books. Did I make a poor choice? It seems I did. The Hunt Club seems to meander aimlessly. I'm now on page 286 and wondering if I should bother continuing. Even the promise that it will get better isn't motivating me. As an avid reader, I'm disappointed that I couldn't add Lescroart to my list of favorite authors. May it suffice to say that, in my opinion, ""The Hunt Club"" is no page-turner."
2,"Disappointing, but let's hope it is a temporary blip...","As some previous reviewers noted, the author has introduced two new characters in this effort, abandoning my favorites, lawyerDismas Hardy and cop Abe Glitsky, who thrilled me in several novels. I just don't feel engaged by the new guys, Wyatt and Juhle. The book is overlong, the hunt for a missing babe gets a bit ridiculous, and it becomes a chore to finish. Perhaps the next in the series, with condensed ""back stories"" for the heroes, will move faster and more credibly."
1,Not a Lescroart winner,"If this book had been written by someone other than Lescroart, it would have been an OK read. But knowing that the author brought several characters so memorably to life (Dismas, Abe, their wives and associates, etc) in a previous series, I expected more from this new effort and was greatly disappointed."
1,What a Disappointment,"This book does not deserve a sequel. The longer I read the book the more conviced I was that this was not a novel but rather an editorial about issues the author has with the State of California. Finally near the end of the book, the story seemed to come together. However the new characters in the book just did not gel for me. I found no warmth between them but rather this seemed to be more of an adversarial friendship."
1,"Great start, but . . .","This book showed great promise early on but quickly degenerated into a very boring story. After reading more than half of it, I gave up. The many storylines and lifeless characters were major factors, and I decided I didn't care how it turned out. In short, a waste of time."
1,A Tedious Read,"There is only so much disbelief I can suspend, and this book exhausted my supply. After the character introduction and exposition of the crime, the author lost his way through the interminable and illogical ditherings of the so-called plot. I soon lost interest in the characters, their motivations, and finally just wanted it to be over."
2,dissapointing,I look forward to his books. but not this time. His new main character leaves a lot to be desired. The plot was messy.
3,Certainly not very entertaining!,Certainly not as interesting as his first books.Much too long and lacking excitment.
4,"Fast, exciting read","This book was exciting from the moment the two main characters met. Some fine tuning might be in order for grammar and punctuation, but all in all, it was an excellent first book: just the right blend of action and romance. I liked the tension caused by all the twists and turns. The main characters were likable and believable. What woman wouldn't feel safe if a trained assassin was watching out for her? It will make a super movie! Can't wait to read more from this author."
2,"Oh God, how very little research went into the writing","Grammar is terriblePunctuation is as wellZero research into anything, from sailing, Israeli culture, Israeli politics, Israeli NAMESOnly 'split second' by David Baldaci was worst I believe, and that says a lot"
4,fast paced espionage tale,"Ward Larsen does not disappoint. He keeps you intrigued from beginning to end. Found him through a daily deal, and now he is one of the authors I am reading on a regular basis. Nice to know that there are lots of authors that aren't ""best Sellers"" but still tell great stories."
4,Assassin Review,"This book started a little slow, but was gripping in the end...unexpected ending. I recommend it as a good read."
4,Excellent book from a new author!,Caught my attention from the first page and held it till the end. The Scotland Yard inspector is a great character- would love to read more books about him! Good read.
4,exciting,"I enjoyed this book although I believe it suffered from a rather poor translation.Still, it provides great suspense, good plot and believable and very likeable characters.Don't think you will be disappointed if you are looking for an entertaining read!"
4,pleasantly surprised,"Couldn't put this book down. Story was fascinating, intriguing. Espionage is my favorite read anyway. Will look for more of his books."
2,"Not bad, but definitely not great","I was a great fan of the Bourne series years ago & this book sounded like it would be exciting & the same genre. It is a little disappointing. The main characters are interesting enough, but can't wait to finish this book. Seems like it doesn't hold my interest for too long."
3,Readable Assassin,Good story. Good pace. Pretty good characters though the seemingly invincibility of our assassin wears a bit thin. Enough suspense to drive you forward through the book and arrive at your destination satisfied. Not however elated or moved to tell your friends about a 'must read book'. Good but not approaching Perfect.
4,A good read . I hope the author keeps improving,"I thought Perfect Assassin was a well paced enjoyable book. Is it the best I have ever read of this type? No, but it certainly was enjoyable and intriguing. I thought the ending was a little weak or I would have given it 5 stars. I would recommend that you give this title a try."
3,Action packed thriller!,"If you're looking for intrique and action, here you go! Book moves rapidly. No dull spots. You begin to see how the plot is going to play ouit fairly early. The characters come alive with some excellent writing. Not necessarily a ""can't put down thriller"" but one you look forward to picking up again."
3,Interesting from the beginning,"Good and easy read. Even better if you have knowledge of foreign affairs. There is a lot of jumping around that at times doesn't make sense, but later all connects."
5,Will buy another book from Larsen,"My first book from this author and I certainly liked it. Good pace, good story, hard to put down.. perhaps too much imagination in some parts... but overall credible."
5,Perfect Assassin,Great book. First book by this author - Ward Larsen. Hope he continues this as a series.
4,Excellent read!,"A solid page turner. It maintains a tight storyline and rapid pace, with well developed characters. If you like Vince Flynn or Stephen Hunter as I do, you're unlikely to be disappointed."
2,Fairly pedestrian,This is a reasonably engaging thriller but requires the reader to accept some fairly implausible plot elements along the way. I think it would be good if authors could move away from assassins who have impossibly high levels of skills in every aspect of their personal and professional functioning.
4,Suspenseful with good story line.,"Well paced story with good character development. Liked the story line, gripping at times - hard book to put down. Well done."
3,average,Not very original - neither the story line nor the quality of writing. For me it's a throw-away read on a beach vacation.
3,"ok, but","Why do I care? The author plots a hunt for a ""good"" assassin. Reasonably well done. But the reader is never hooked. Never invests anything with the characters, and ultimately doesn't care."
1,The Perfect Sleep Aid,"Really quick...The 5-star reviewers are lying to you.-Just another book where they talk about how lethal the character is but he never does anything special.The author puts alot of effort into making this one bad.Horribly overwritten.Initially, I had the feeling that the story was building at a slow pace...There's no reward.I can forgive a book for being predictable... IF its entertaining.No bright side to this one."
4,perfect assassin,a well written book with lots of action. I like the characters and the interaction between the characters. A very good read with up to date facts
3,The perfect Assassin,This was a good read but is written in what I would call emode. Short snappy chapters follownig the journeys of the various characters in the story.I enjoyed the plot and the main characters were well drawn. But emode does get a bit tedious after a while.
5,the Perfecrt Assassin,"A really good book, did not want to put it down!!!! moves right along even though it goes from one scenario to another its easy to follow. One of the best mysteries I have ready lately, one of the kind that you want it to come to the end to see what happens and yet its so good that it could be longer!!"
3,What will happen next?,"It was a little over the top in some parts - like a super indestructible Jason Bourne, but overall I liked it b/c it was suspenseful and adventurous. If you are looking for a fantasy thriller this is a good pick. Well written and seemingly knowledgeable with military/spy tactics."
4,Perfect Assasin,"My new favourtite author, similar to Baldacci in style. Face paced, well written with mulitple strands to the story. Keeps you guessing."
3,Lame But Engrossing,"Read quickly.Good characters, believable dialogue but lame when assassin slept with the woman he abducted. Then suddenly...he is in love, forgetting things. The last 1/4 of the book was a disappointment."
5,Great First Book,"I loved this book from the start.You get a heroine and a hero who work together to make things right. I've always loved the Israeli assasin Mossad type characters. They bring a ""winning--ness"" to the terrorist type of threats we face everyday. And in this story Ward Larsen doesn't fail. Fast paced plot and lots of action.Very good read. I look forward to reading his other 3 books."
3,scooby doo,"a book that in the beginning was very hard to get into, but once one got through a few chapters, I found it very interesting, but the end was hard to fathom out."
3,The Not-so perfect assaisn,The Perfect Assasin was a good read. However the book ending was so abrupt that it made it a little unsatisfying.
2,too slow,This book just never quite got to the point that I didn't want to put it down. Instead I found myself wanting to hurry up and finish so I would be done with it. Finally decided I didn't care enough about the characters to see how it ended!
4,The Perfect Assassin,An unusual story line that unfolds in very readable form. It is a good read that gets you in so that you want to keep going to the end.
4,Nice Read -,This is the first book I've read by Larsen. Entertaining read. Well written and I look forward to reading more of his work. Frank
4,Pretty good read,"I got this for $1.99 special so I wasn't expecting much. Many of the free and inexpensive Kindle offerings are new authors, with minimal editing, and plot holes big enough to drive through. This was pretty good.Some of the ideas strained at logic, time was condensed/expanded inconsistently, but the story moved well. It was tightly written with few superfluous detours. I liked that there were as many good, trustworthy people as there were bad, deceptive ones. It had a few unrealistic moments, but the protagonist was a little smarter and more capable than everyone else, and I always like that in my thrillers.I enjoyed it."
3,Kept me guessing who the bad guy was,"I really enjoyed all the characters. But some parts were more for men than a lady. However, it was entertaining."
2,UNMEMORABLE,"I don't remember the story now, so must not have been exceptional, although I did read it to the end"
4,Decent first book,"Larsen's book has the usual formulaic ingredients-action scenes,convoluted plots,romantic interest-but lacks in credibility even compared to other novels in the genre:there is a little too much deus ex machina for my taste.That being said I will look forward to Mr Larsen's next book as he does have potential."
2,solo sailor no way,"solo sailors do not sleep at night, they cat nap daylight hours when visibility is max, if a vessel is on the horizon it takes 7 to 30 minutes traveling on a straight line to make contact. the writer's ""hook"" of picking up a person in the open seas is next to impossible by an experienced solo sailor If a movie is in fact to be produced, write this in a manner that would seem plausible. Bad start for me with so many good books out there to read, however at 99 cents what do you expect?"
3,Not Quite Convinced,"Although some parts of the story were a bit far-fetched it was pretty good reading most of the time. Some of the sailboat terminology wasn't very convincing. The thing that probably tipped my score from a 4 to a 3 was that the personal interaction between the main characters wasn't very well developed. I just wasn't drawn into their lives the I would have been by some authors. Also, I often found myself unconvinced that real people would react the way they did in similar circumstances."
4,Great story.,Enjoyed reading this book Mr. Larsen set a great action story. The book moves well and fun to read . Enjoyed this Bondish type reading material w/o Mr. Bond though
3,Always a twist,"Keeps you guessing. Parts are predictable, but for the most part it's a good read. This book is worth the price"
4,Enjoyed it.,I thought I had this book figured out about 5 different times. The plot twists and turns. I had a hard time putting it down. Mr. Larsen goes easy on the technology and concentrates more on the story. I could have used a bit more techno-speak but I still really enjoyed this book.
1,Wrong rope arrived,"I had been researching ropes for awhile, and decided on the 70M dry as a all-around workhorse. When I typed this into the google search-box, I was looking for the best price. I found the rope I wanted on Amazon. Now I've never ordered any climbing gear from Amazon before, but figured it's a rope. How can you mess that up? Well I don't know how they did it, but they did. The rope that arrived wasn't the 70M Dry that I ordered. (I have the receipt).When I asked Amazon what happened, they had now idea. All they said they could do was refund my money. I called the Gear Co-op and nobody returned my call. I sent the rope back. Now my question is this: Is it legal to advertise one thing and then sell another? I think the term ""bait and switch"" would have qualified here."
4,Great for the price,Got a lee pro 1000 very similar to this one somewhere else for about $170. Loaded about 500 rounds so far and after some adjustment and getting used to a progressive press i knocked out about 250 rounds in 45 min. just keep your primers full and you should be good.
3,Fun Horror,"Horror films fall into two camps for me - serious horror and not serious horror. Serious horror is focused on delivering good scares with mood, shock, etc.; it requires a highly effective director and story to pull off, and my standards are very high. The not serious horror is very different; the focus (in my opinion) is not necessarily on creating real scares through a sustained mood of dread, but more on a fun story, loose horror, typically young actors, some comic elements, etc. This movie is clearly in the latter category, and you must have that mindset going in to enjoy it. Be warned - its very low budget, and some of the acting is ok (and sometimes there's a very noticeable discomfort as an actor looks directly into a camera). But...on the good side, the dialog is generally good, there are no characters that I hate (which is often a downfall of low budget horror), some good comic parts, and its filmed on a boat, a fun thematic element to me."
4,so cool,"Jump is an unbelievably good track. Rappers respect this group and i guarantee you will also, man! listen to two young dudes up on hip hop."
3,Klassic!,"In the early 90's, if the word jump was in your hip-hop song, you had a hit. The song ""Jump"" was so well put together I'm sure they knew it would be huge before it was out. No clothes gimmick was really needed, but why not play it safe. Now this album sits in the used bins with Positive K, Das Efx and Tone Loc. Ahh when rap was fun, and those are all still good jams. Totally Krossed Out has a number of other good songs. I remember singing ""Warm It Up"" all the time. Second best song easy. It may be tempting to just download the big hit here, but since it's often one penny used, why not get the cd and jump!"
3,Old school,"I got this knowing I would like at least three songs. And that is about it. I still only like three songs. Jump (and it's extended mix), Warm it up, and I missed the bus. The rest are too old school for me I guess! Still better than paying retail!"
2,Music for tha kiddies.,Tha title says it all. This is strictly for tha kids. It doesn't fail at being just that so I guess this album was a success for them. They did have a few tracks on here that transcended age but not enough to pay for. This is a good listen if you wanna take a trip down memory lane though.Notable Tracks:JumpWarm It UpI Missed The Bus
1,Yard Dancin',Well..... I can't love it. I can't hate it. I can't stop myself from listening to it. This is more of a cry for help! (I feel like dancin')
1,"No ""flava"" in this cd.","I remember back in the early 90's, when Kriss Kross, was the man. Everyone thought so. I was 18, back then, and I had seen many trends in the music business. This was definetly one of them.All these ""teen"" groups, you are currently familar with, (Backstreet Boys, N' Sync), will be the same way Kriss Kross is, in a couple of years.Kriss Kross may make a comeback, but, come on! Those guys are in their 20's now. They might enjoy the comeback success that MC Hammer enjoyed!Sorry guys, but I think the first reviewer hit the nail on the head. Kriss Kross can't make anything memorable!"
2,Where are the other hits?,"I like the songs on this disc, but it's missing a few of their bigger hits. Like that one that goes, ""At the playground, know what I'm sayin'? / Plaaaayground / Oh yeah, ABC is back"". I thinks it's called ""At The Playground"". And what about that other song, ""Iesha"". I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed."
4,LIL BOYS IN THE GAME,"This cd is fantastic, the sounds are really cool and all classic sounds whit original style, I remember the bomb whit the song JUMP featuring warm it up, it s a shame and i missed the bus are the best songs in this album."
1,"Gee, was it a trend or what?","Hey, how come no one else reviewed this? If Amazon.com was out at the time of this release, this place would be packed with 5 Star reviews, and girls saying ""This guy is sexy!"". No more, of this trend. I am for one glad, I will never hear ""Jump"" again."
3,It was alright,"I was such a typical teen, I just knew Kriss Kross was da' bomb diggity. Yes, I tried wearing my jeans backwards, it wasn't working. Especially when I had to go to the bathroom...REAL BADLY!! This album for me really didn't do much for me. I didn't play it to death like I did all of my other boy bands that I enjoyed listening too. And of course, I thought they were cute but of course we all thought the ""Light skinned"" Chris was cuter than the other Chris. Remember that?? Kriss Kross'll make ya jump jump!!"
5,Excellent update of a classic,"This book is largely an update of the author's earlier classic, _Secret Freedom Fighter: How To Fight Tyranny Without Terrorizing The Innocent._ Outdated information has been removed, and there is now references to things that happened since the first edition came out. I was one of those lobbying for the original to be reprinted, but this is better than a straight reprint would be."
4,A great read,The thing that appealed to me about this book is that it has a spectrum of situations and what the author feels is appropriate action within different possibilities.
1,Ridiculous Nonsense,"There is never anything wrong with questioning something, but this book is laid out to make a person supposedly feel like they are someone doing something rebellious while staying within the lines. Please, do not apply the word ""insurgent"" to someone walking a picket line or fighting the IRS paper trail, that is truly ridiculous nonsense."
4,Mmm... Rich German-y goodness...,"A must-have compilation of anyone trying to see the scope of industrial music. Great singles cuts, lots of listener's tracks as well."
2,Bulb burned out in under one month.,"I ordered this Product on 1/11, today is 2/6. After seeing the bulb flicker, I checked the manual to find that its technically burnt out and needs to be replaced.After reading the next page of the manual I see that it says:ImportantThe UV-C bulb is specifically excluded from this warranty. Use only a Guardian Technologiesreplacement bulb. See the section under the heading ""Replacing and Cleaning the UV-C Bulb and Filter.""I'm hoping the replacement bulb lasts the expected 6 months. But it doesn't make a happy buyer.Otherwise I'm happy with the product. This little unit I blame for preventing the plague that was crossing my office space from coming down my cube isle."
1,Failed in 4 weeks,I purchased three of these together as they were on sale. The bulbs in all of them failed in less than a month and the fan also failed in one of the units. Terrible quality control on this Germ Guardian.
4,Great Unit!,"I purchased my Germ Guardian unit about 2 years ago from Lowe's for my home bedroom. I'm currently considering a second purchase for my office which is located in an old dorm building. I haven't had an issue with the bulb, and I've let this thing run since I've had it! The only times I turn it off is to get under the hood to clean out the filter, of which I'm ordering a replacement for today. I would definitely recommend this as a way to clean the air of mold and bacteria. To note, it is not made for filtering the air, but sterilizing it."
2,Bulbs still failing early,"Bought 2 units Jan 4th 2013, both bulbs failed to light after just 4 weeks in continous (on) service. Contacted company, they claim new type bulbs are being used now, we'll see how the new ones they're sending out (no charge) last, I'll write a follow-up after a few months with new type bulbs installed!? I'd wait a month or two from this posting date to buy one, for the supposed old ones to filter out of the supply stream..as they (germ guardian) claims!Ohh yeah...the motors in some are louder than others, not to bad if off in a (20ft) corner from you, they sound (PC case cooler type) cheap,...imagine that..huh!?"
1,"Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says, ""most home air purifiers fall short""","UV purifiers. These devices rely on ultraviolet light to neutralize biological contaminants. Experts agree that UV light is effective in destroying microbes such as bacteria, dust mites and mold spores, given sufficient exposure time. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), however, most home air purifiers fall short: ""Bacterial spores would require a relatively long time under the light for the light to have a killing effect. Most household air cleaners move air too quickly to provide adequate exposure time."" Without the addition of a filter and fan, UV purifiers are ineffective against particles such as dust, pollen and pet dander, and some experts have raised concerns about the safety of UV units in household settings."
1,This is a gimmick!,"When I first learned about the Germ Guardian, I thought, ""Wow! I've just got to have it!"" The manufacturers claimed that it was tested and found effective by the Harvard School of Public Health so I was impressed and ordered it. It turned out to be a slick looking product, space age and all and it looked good in the house but unfortunately, that's the only good thing I can say about it because after 5 days, my sneezing (I have allergic rhinitis) was no better, I felt the same as I did before it arrived and then, one day, I came down with an absolutely severe allergic attack and this thing did absolutely, 100% NOTHING!! So I have sent it back for refund. I don't recommend it at all and I feel that the whole thing is just a big bad gimmick."
1,POOR QUALITY,"POOR QUALITY, FAN MAKES NOISE AND YOU CAN HARDLY FEEL ANY AIR MOVEMENT, THIS IS A PIECE OF JUNK!"
2,It works! for almost two months?,"I used this in a sick house bedroom (lots of mold about including one toxic strain, likely due to a leaking ceiling) and I was no longer sneezing before going to bed each night. In a month's time, however, the unit was already constantly making random noises that sounded like its bulb was about to explode, and the light would flicker on and off, often waking me up, all night long. I got another air filter machine, (True Allergen Remover: HEPA type?) and that seems to help maybe as good as this machine, but as the bulb to this unit burnt out in just over two months of use, I'll be sticking with my other machine. Even if I got a new bulb for this, I don't want to be constantly woken up by this thing. If I hadn't been in the process of moving and packing stuff up I would have tried calling the company to get a replacement bulb.Be Warned!"
2,The Germ Guardian would be great if the bulbs lasted more than a couple of weeks.,"I purchased two EV9102 air purifiers and they did a great job of removing the odors created by three dogs. But the bulbs burned out in couple of weeks, and the replacement bulbs I've purchased burned out quickly, too. I've replaced the bulbs three times, and have given up."
1,"Nice idea, but junk construction","Seemed like such an amazingly quiet device. It was a few months before I realized there's a fan inside the unit to move air, and that fan is frozen in place (I can push the blades around with a stick, but they're very very stiff.)Junk. Too bad, I liked the idea."
1,"AWFUL, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!",I purchased this unit new at Lowe's and the bulb began to flicker after less than 6 weeks after I started using it. I ended up boxing it up and taking it back to Lowe's for a full refund.If you do buy this save your box because you will need it!!This is more cheap junk made in China!! Buy American made products and boycott this Chinese garbage and bring back jobs to Americans!!
1,Loop holes,"Arrived on time looked and worked well. In less than 50 days use (1200 hours) the bulb burned out. The warranty is pretty standard till you come to the bulb - NO WARRANTY. So recommended bulb replacement almost 25% the cost of the unit. While it was apart to get to the bulb I took a look at the ""filter"" a small plastic disk but in a unique shape. Recommended replacement for filter - yearly, cost $28. Reminds me a the Polaroid camera - great price on equipment but the replacement parts unique and pricy."
2,loud fan,"I bought one of these from the local Lowe's and returned it. The fan in it was loud even on the lowest setting. This would have been fine if it were moving a lot of air, but as the others on here have said it barely moves air.. so why all the noise? It was louder than my computer.Also, it doesn't need to move a lot of air through it to treat all of the air in a room over the course of 24hrs.I'll try another at some point.. and if it's loud then I'll swap the fan for a higher quality one."
1,"Poor construction, extremely noisy, fan failure","Rugged appearance of exterior can't mask shockingly cheap interior components. The fan lasted less than one week, and the bulb flickered and sizzled after three days of use. Maybe there was a bad batch? Do not recommend."
2,BAD PRODUCT,"I purchased this unit and the bulbs kept burning out within 4-6 weeks. I contacted the company and they knew the model right away( I'm guessing it is a common problem) and sent me a replacment unit. Within 4 weeks of the NEW unit running, the light burned out . The company sent me a replacement bulb, it burned out today after 3 weeks. I have been over the proper use and location for the product with the company and am following it. However, the bulbs still last less than a month. The UV-C light does help with the mold and such in my apartment. I reccomend using UV-C light, Just NOT this brand. Perhaps it is a bad model design but for the money I am not willing to find out ."
1,Didn't even last a month,"Week 2 of ownership, the unit started making some noise, so I turned it off. Tried turning it on later (different outlet) and the bulb flickered, plus the noise. Took it apart to see if was dirty, and it was pretty spotless. What a waste of money. There aren't any decent dehumidifiers or mold killers sold where I live, so to anticipate something I thought that would help was a major letdown."
2,Not worth buying.,Seemed to work at first but light started to flicker within a month of receiving it. Not worth purchasing if the manual says 8-10 months but lasts 3 weeks.
1,Waste pf money!!!,What a waste. Had to return the first one because it was DOA and now this one stopped working after only 3 months. total waste of my time and money!
2,Decent product but does not cover room adequately,"After hearing about this product and reading the reviews, decided to get one for our newborn baby. The problem however, is that this does not cover the entire room even on its ""high"" setting. Over the course of an hour, I would say this thing covers only a sixth of the air in our room (12 x 12). I put my hand in front of the sanitizer and could barely feel any airflow and this was on the high setting. I've only had this product for a month so I will have to follow-up on durability.First month impression is this thing is too weak to adequately sanitize an entire room. If it were a bit stronger, would give a better rating. I feel like I will return this item and get a stronger air cleaner, or buy 3 of these (not practical)."
1,"Germ Guardian ev-9-102 uv-c Air Sanitizer, Black",The UV light went out on the sanitizer five days after using 24 hours a day. There is no restriction as to the amount of usage. Where can you get replacement lights?
1,"light bulb burned out in about 1.5 months, no response from customer service","Bought for parents, light bulb burned out in about 1 and a half months. e-mailed customer support, no response after 2 weeks. another review said they got a replacement bulb from the company at no charge. good luck with that."
2,Wish it would keep working....,For the short time that these actually ran they worked beautifully.I purchased the first one and ran it in my musty basement with great success for about two weeks when the light went out so I returned it for another and Amazon has been great at getting the replacement out to me in a timely fashion.Now about two days after receiving the second one the fan has quit working.I notice a huge difference in the smells in my basement and in my breathing in the whole house when it was working.But I'm not bothering with trying a third machine at this point. I'm going to look around for a different brand.
4,"Great product, but poor light bulb","We bought this to sanitize environment in the kitchen. UV light is a proven technology used in hospital so that's out of question. It's a bit noisy, but since I keep in the kitchen, it does not bother us at all. We keep it running 24 hours; after 28 days, it started to flicker as an indicator that the light was burnt out. Note that it was about 1/10 manufacture estimate. I contacted the manufacture, and was told that the bulb should last 6,000 hours. Anyway, they would send me another bulb for free (free shipping). Right now, I am waiting for the shipment. Same bulb is about $10 on Ebay vs $29.99 at electronic stores. I know it fits, but there is no way to verify if it does UV or just regular light with a fit socket. I think I rather buy manufacture's bulb or from Lowe's just for a piece of mind.------Updated:In May, 2012, the manufacture did send me a replacement bulb. All went well. Great customer support!!!"
5,Impossible to give this a bad review,Reader from usa certainly got this wrong - not even a mention of Vienna or Israel. I guess this is the problem. This is a highly mystical book and will only be understood by those who have that inclination. Others will see it as confusing. I thought this was one of the great works of the last year and have made sure I have told everyone about it. It moved me for weeks after and to give this a bad review is just impossible.
4,Works,"I got this laxative tea for a cleanse I was going on. I chose it over the other main brandTraditional Medicinals Organic Smooth Move Herbal Stimulant Laxative Tea, 16-Count Wrapped Tea Bags (Pack of 6)because, though the ingredients are mainly the same, the other tea contained fennel which I can't stand. This tea tastes fine. I don't like mint flavoring, and you can taste the mint, but it is subdued. I even drank this tea for pleasure once on a cold day when I had nothing else warm and calorie-free in the house.This tea definitely performs the stated purpose. It does get things moving. The active herb is senna, which contracts your digestive muscles to get things out. I find it causes me to cramp just a little too much, however I'll happily take a natural remedy to constipation that makes me cramp if it means I don't have to put the totally bizarre ingredients in over-the-counter laxatives in my body. Overall I'd definitely recommend it."
5,works Great,"This is a great tasting tea, works fast and naturaly. I love it with stevia, try it you won't be disappointed"
5,LOVE THIS TEA!,"I've been drinking this tea for years and I was very excited to find such a cost effective option to order in bulk like this. It works great! I drink it before bed, its caffeine free and there's something about the licorice undertones that is calming. An hour or two after I wake up, BAM! I swear the detoxing effect helps my skin too! This tea will get you moving. Enough said."
5,Supremely listenable rock,"The Bevis Frond was one of those bands that I had always heard of, but never heard, so I bought Valedictory Songs just to find out more. It has not yet left the CD player in my car. Every song has merit, and most are neo-psychedlic masterpieces: some of the riffs recall Hendrix and Led Zep at their heaviest, but the arrangements are not throwbacks--many sound positively post-grunge. Besides, teenagers couldn't write these lyrics! Nick Saloman, as a lyricist, seems alternately caught between cynicism, wonder, and bafflement, and I think most slightly-older-guys can relate. My favorites: Let Them Beautify You, Early Riser, Can't Feel It, and the exquisite High On A Downer."
4,Bevis Frond - 'Valedictory Songs' (Rubric/Woronzow),"Good neo-psych release from long-running trio known as Bevis Frond.Seventeen tracks total.The disc gets better as it progresses.Tunes I found to my liking are ""By The Water's Edge"",the melodic ""Early Riser"",""Let Them Beautify You"",the upbeat ""We Are The Dead"",the jammin' ""Sugar Voids"",""Old School Rock"" and ""Living In Real Time"".Really liked the instrumental passages that occured several times.I mean,this band can PLAY!Line-up:Nick Saloman-guitar,keyboards&vocals,Adrian Shaw-bass and Andy Ward-drums.Comes with 16-page booklet packed with song lyrics.Might appeal to fans of Flaming Lips,Mercury Rev,Sonic Youth and Julian Cope.Note:also see my review of Adrian Shaw's 'Tea For The Hydra' disc.A should-have."
1,Tammy Wynette,Was not able to play in my DVD as this DVD was made in Germany and I do not have a DVD that will play it.
3,slightly disappointed,"I love Moosewood- I love visiting and I love their cookbooks, and, like many people out there, I owe much of my culinary incliantions to them. I can't place what it was, but somehow this book just didn't measure up to the others in their collection. It isn't that these are not meals you would serve for ""festive"" occasions, it is just that none of them really struck me as something I would want to serve while playing hostess to people whom I have never cooked for before. There are so many other great recipies from the Moosewood that would be more appealing- especially if you are serving guests who are not vegetarians (meaning, I don't think any of these meals would really impress non-veggies). I would suggest getting one of the other books in the collection, and choosing meals for yourself that you think would best suit your occasion."
4,"Good recipes, pretty cookbook","I bought this cookbook after I tried the ""Harvest Nuts & Seeds"" at a dinner party. The recipes are easy to make and very good. I would recommend this cookbook for tasty vegetable recipes. The desserts are good too."
3,Just OK,"It's a book with some good recipes but I was expecting more, I can find similar or better ones online almost in every blog or food network or books I've at home."
3,"It's not the best Moosewood cookbook, but it's okay...",My biggest complaint: Lots and lots of seafood recipes. Since when did fish and shellfish become part of a vegetarian diet?
1,Deceptive Don't be fooled,This cookbook is not Vegetarian at all. Maybe a good portion of the recipes are.FISH is a breathing creature and if you eat it you are a Pescotarian not vegetarian.
2,Televue Eyepiece bag,"Like many amateurs who have been observing for many years, we have collected more than a few Televue eyepieces. And we get quite attached to our eyepieces and consequently, the eyepiece case can be very personal item. I was attracted to this case because it is a softcase unlike my other cases.Now I understand you can't provide the cut outs for all the various configurations of everyone's eyepieces. I had read TeleVue's specs on the bag before purchasing. That said, it would be nice to be able to choose from say 2 or 3 configurations. My hard reality is that I would need 3 to 4 of these cases for all my eyepieces and then there would be eyepieces left over that did not fit the remaining cutouts. But at this price, that is way to steep. I am still evaluating other solutions. So I'd recommend this only with reservations."
5,Reversible and machine washable - mandatory for white bath rugs,"Soft reversible rug that machine washes with ease (we've washed several times so far).We use one side, flip it when it gets too dirty (which is real easy for a white rug), and then throw it in the wash with the rest of our towels, tee-shirt, etc.Softness hasn't decreased after our 3 washes."
2,Greatest hits?,"A greatest hits collection only in name. Half of the ""hits"" on this album are unlistenable songs I'd never previously heard, and many of their real hits are missing.Reminds me of the English Beat ""Best of"" that didn't include Save It For Later, the only top 40 hit they ever had.I don't know if there are better Cheap Trick collections out there, but this is a waste."
4,"Four stars only in the context of the 24 cut Jap.version. Why do they always get the good stuff, Rick...","The 24 cut Japanese version of the 1991 releasedCheap Trick, The Greatest Hits has even more ofthe REALLY good stuff on it. The stuff from theLPS that Jon Brant played on when Cheap Trickthe band, was the kings of MTV! B.B.B? Hope so!"
5,My son's favorite book,"We love this simple story, with it's adorable pictures, and interesting artistic perspective. I think when you are a child, you pick a book that just sticks with you. My son is not adopted, but we love this story all the same. Perhaps because we love and raise ducks. Ducks are amazing, vulnerable creatures. They are always, ALWAYS, together, inseparable. I disagree with another reviewer who stated that this book is not a good adoption story... I think the reality is that many children who are adopted do come from 'crocodiles' and have to reconcile who they are with where they come from."
4,Doing the right thing,"So, here's this crocodile mixed up in a duck's nest. You know this can't end well - crocodiles! They eat ducks!Of course, Guji Guji, although more ruthless than the average duck, is not ready to eat his family, so it all turns out to have a nice pat ending anyway with a minimum of carnage.I did find the resolution a little too fast... and maybe somewhat overdone. Why throw rocks on the crocs? Why not just... not show up to where they were waiting?"
5,Children's Book,Good message about being true to yourself. Not giving in to peer pressure. And about a mother's unconditional love.
3,Not A Positive Adoption Story,"As a former foster child and current child advocate, I would not classify ""Guji Guji"" as a positive adoption story.It's nice that Mother Duckling loves all her ducklings the same, including a baby crocodile whose egg rolled into her nest while she was reading.However, the crocodiles (Guji's natural family) are depicted as bad. Inherently bad. So bad that after meeting them, Guji Guji stares into a lake and wonders, ""Is it true? Am I a bad crocodile too?""Think about how you might feel if you were an adopted child, of a different race than your adoptive family, and you read this book. Its message is incomplete. Why? Because, in this book, to be a crocodile means to be ""bad.""There are no other ""good"" crocodile pictured. What children will take away is: ducks are good, crocodiles are bad. Ducks are cute, fluffy and nurturing and crocodiles are carnivores with sharp, pointy teeth.So... this is a wonderful picture book - but definitely not an adoption story."
5,We love Joe!,My daugther is 3 years old and it only took her one evening and she was playing the game on her own. It is very educational learning to buy items and picking out different shapes of food. Their is also A school where there is a computer where they can print different kinds of pictures on it. My daughter can play it for hours if she was aloud. I am sure your child will love it too. I also have a 5 year old nephew that plays this game that also enjoys very much.
2,"Great promise, does not deliver","I bought this after reading these reviews hoping for a fun new game for my 2 year old. He has already mastered the mouse, colors, numbers, alphabet & has several other preschool games.This game is absolutely dull. The graphics are great, but it only holds his attention for a few minutes. The problem is that each section takes too long to load. Once loaded you have to listen to a VERY long discussion on each area. BORING! He looked at me & asked ""play Elmo instead?""He enjoys the free Sesame Street & Noggin websites much better then this game. Learning should be fun. I am very sorry I purchased this CD"
3,Blue's Clues Preschool is Pretty Good,"Blue's Clues Preschool is pretty good, but not great. My 3-1/2 year old daughter likes Joe and the animation... but it's a bit of a pig on performance and limited options. She plays this game the least of all."
3,Not as good as the other Blue titles...,"Our 3 yeat old son doesn't care for it... he asks for the old 'Steve' games... like the art one and Blue's Birthday party. It's not Joe's fault here, it's just that the game is pretty basic and does not offer many choices."
2,"Go with the ""old"" Blues Clues programs","We were so excited to see a new title released with Joe in it. We quickly oredered this for my 3 year old twins and when it arrived we were very diappointed. The kids quickly bored of it and don't even ask to play it anymore. When asked if they want a Blues Clues with Steve or Joe in it they say ""NO JOE!!"". Stick with the older Blue's Clues, my twins love Blues Art Time activities."
2,Unsatisfying,"Blue is cute, but this program is a bit on the boring side. If each of the activities in this program were released seperately on its own, they'd make a nice little online Flash or Shockwave game that you would expect to play for free on the web. And like most online games, you wouldn't be too impressed when you were done. Too bad as we were expecting more than that from Blue."
5,"Outstanding new songs,","This album was a pleasant surprise as I really enjoyed many of the songs and found myself playing it over and over (many times a CD will only have 1 song that I listen to). The title song ""Loving You Up"" just stays with you all day long. ""Tell Me I'm Wrong"" is a classic C/W ballad and ""Wasn't It You"" is fun. ""Never Stop"" has lyrics describing true love that's really clever. There is even a ""blues"" song. The music and quality is excellent."
5,You will feel like an insider,"This travel book is very good and easy to read. It covers basically all the major attractions in Vancouver and it even gives you a list of the top ten activities not to miss. For every single attraction, you will find detailed description on how to get there (either by car or by taking the public bus), the admission fee, hours of service, and a phone number. The book includes about ten maps that are absolutely great. You will also find the information on restaurants very useful. They organize them by location, by cuisine, and by price range. This book is a great travel planner you will like to read before visiting Vancouver. And, do not forget to bring your umbrella and your rain jacket!"
1,Hard to Get Through,"I am still trying to read this book. I am not a grammatical genious, but there are so many errors in wording, spelling etc that I can't get to what the book is saying to me, because I am not sure if that what was written on the page was really what was meant. Being bi-polar is hard enough, but making it harder to understand doesn't help either."
3,Oh well and Ho Hum,"If you have read the published journals and collected letters, this book is largely redundant. Ms Reardon has meticulously documented how she has supplemented these with interviews and excerpts from the Fisher papers at the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe. Despite the significant effort and research, I'm not sure that this book has added significant content or understanding. I believe that we are all human beings with our own frailties and foibles and I think that Ms Reardon has tried to fairly capture that aspect of Ms Fisher's life. However I think Ms Fisher's voice in the published journals and letters does this as well."
3,A very dense biography,"While Reardon has done her homework and then some, there is no interpretative consciousness that evaluated whether a fact matters or not, and so the book becomes dense with facts that are either insignificant or whose significant is never revealed, so that they crowd out the more purposeful narrative like weeds in a garden. I had to read sections of the book twice to get to important aspects of her biography. Moreover, there is little effort by the author to weave the story of her writings with the story of her life, and since it is only the former that makes us care about the latter, this is short schrift where long schrift would be better. Finally, in this period (ours), one doesn't expect nor particularly want a sense of ""shock"" about Fisher's lesbian relationship."
3,Mack trucks photo gallery,"This book has lots of pictures, just like it says, they're all black/white. Most of these pics can be found in other ""truck"" books. If you're in-to Mack trucks it's a required item but it's not suitable coffee table fodder."
1,Poor quality,"Very poor quality! After about 1 week, all the liquid instead leaked out and caused a stain in my car that was inpossible to remove. Will not buy again!"
3,extremely thin cable is not reassuring,"Thick audio cables tend to be more robust .These are surprisingly thin. They may be fine, but the thinness makes you wonder.They arrived the same day that these did and these are much thicker, a bit cheaper and a few inches longer:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I23TTO/ref=oss_productI will keep the thin ones as a backup. StarTech is a good company."
5,Great Service,Fast service from all company with Amazon - You can't go wrong with Amazon's products and service for customers. Just try them and you will be please.
5,Peace and Power,"After listening to this newest CD I now realize why I love Joanne's music. From the first time I heard her music and how it compelled me to talk the storeowner into selling me the demonstration CD, the only one he had, convincing him that I had to have it now. Then I went to search out and find all of her existing music to add to my collection. It is not hard to understand why she has won so many accolades and awards. This newest album is a weaving of her past magic into a new medicine bundle of music. Listening to the healing that comes forth only makes me yearn for what comes next."
5,A great blessed voice,This is the first CD that I buy of Joanne Shenandoah. It was I great surprise not just for the quality of the production but for the unique sweet voice Joanne has to sing this king of songs. To those who are looking for new experience into this kind of music it is high recommended.
4,Peace & Power: Best of Joanne Shenandoah,The songs are beautiful and beautifully sung. I am happy that I got the CD. I like music that has more drum beats and rhythm. More of a beat to it - a little faster pace. But I enjoy the album alot and recommend it to others.
5,Fantastic CD!,"I am a very new listener of Dir en, and I must admit that this CD rocks in ways that I can hardly discribe! Every track is absolutely killer, but my favorites that I can't seem to stop listening to are ""Child Prey"" and ""New Age Culture"" which I find to be a very addictive head-banger (especially for an old head-banger like myself). Any fan of hard edged rock, be it JRock or not, should give Vulgar a listen, it's now my number one CD."
1,Utterly boring,"Too much going on at once, sounds like they put songs up in the air and mixed them together, plus the guys voice sounds horse.CD really was bad, not worth $40, worth more like $2."
2,Not a fan,"I purchased these bags along with the Gerber NUK/Gerber Seal N Go (AWESOME bags) and the Honey Suckle bags (ok bags). These Gerber bags are far better than both.The reason I do not like these Lansinoh bags is that of the three brands that I purchased, these seem the thinest and flimsiest. The seams of the bags appear very thin and fragile, however, of the few bags that I have used so far none have leaked. Also, the ziploc on the bags is not great. I always try to eliminate as much air as possible when I seal a bag but the ziploc on these bags can be a tad bit challenging to line up and seal quickly. This causes more air than I would like to be sealed into the bag.So far these bags do the job but I am not happy with the quality and ease of use. I would not purchase these again."
3,they don't really stand up,These bags are a good price and hold a lot plus they lay flat. However I have twice lost a whole bag of milk when I was pouring milk into them. They are advertised as able to stand up but they don't really. They have fallen over and spilled milk everywhere. Just keep it in mind when you are filling them.
1,Awful!,These bags are awful and all LEAK! This is the first review I have ever written for any product. I have NEVER been more disappointed especially when since they are for breast milk. My son is a 30 week preemie and I'm trying to give him all the breast milk I can but have lost so much because of these bags. They should be DISCONTINUED IMMEDIATELY!
1,Please don't buy these bags,"I am so upset that I didn't research milk bags before I bought these. Seriously, I have to research everything, including the plastic bag that I pour expressed breastmilk into - that is crazy. Anyway, these bags LEAK!!!! What is the point of a milk storage bag, if it is going to leak from the bottom seam. It is not like the manufacturer warns you about this potential, but they probably should considering that reviews discussing bags leaking from the bottom seam go back several years. Breastmilk is precious and it is extremely disheartening when you realize that you have to throw milk away because of a leaking milk storage bag. Do NOT buy these bags!!!"
2,bags can leak,"These bags can leak when defrosted, maybe a couple bags per box. I'm going to try other brands. I use them with the playtex drop-ins which is very convenient. I pump frequently since I'm returning to work and am looking for something to streamline the process."
2,They leak if frozen,"I would say that about 25% of these bags leak. I have found that they leak less often if frozen flat,rather than upright, but they still leak. The best way to prevent leaking is to open the bag to release the vaccuum seal, then thaw it tilting down towards the top of the bag, since the bottom of the bag is where it breaks. This morning I forgot to do that, and I lost an ounce and a half to the sink. That's a lot of milk! I nearly cried. I've been working hard at keeping up my milk supply since I started taking my son to daycare, and it's a shame to keep losing milk due to leaks.I am debating getting the milk freeze trays from freshbaby that lets you freeze them into little 1-ounce milk cubes, then you can put them in a ziploc freezer bag after that."
1,Leaky Bags,"We bought these because we liked the safety of the double-zipper. But it doesn't do much good when the bags leak. 10%-20% of the time the bags leak when you defrost. Why take that risk with your ""liquid gold""."
5,Best Breast Milk Storage Bags,"I have a 6 mo old and have been pumping & storing since shortly after she was born. These are the thickest bags on the market and I have never encountered any problems with leakage. Each bag is sealed and you must tear the perforation before filling, so I feel safe that it is sterile (unlike Gerber bags). I have used Lansinoh and Gerber and feel much more confident with the Lansinoh bags. These are, in my opinion, excellent breast milk storage bags."
2,"They may be the best bags on the market, but they're still not good enough.","I chose these bags partly because of the reviews that I read on this website and because they made economic sense. I gave birth to a premature infant who was unable to breastfeed. I have pumped everyday btwn 6-8 times a day since she was born and was blessed to have an ample milk supply. However, when thawing these bags out I found that I was losing sometimes 4 and 5 bags of at a time due to leakage not from the double seal at the top, but from a seam at the bottom (and no I did not fill them over the 6 oz mark). I later tried some of the other bags out there and found that yes, these bags are better than their competitors, but they were not good enough for me. I have worked way too hard to provide my child with nourishment only to have it leak all over the place. My solution was to use bottles. They too have disadvantages (take up more room in the freezer), but I feel that they are a better choice."
2,These suckers leak!,"I got an opened package of these from a friend who gave me some of her extra stuff. I rarely pump and even more rarely thaw out frozen breastmilk, so when one leaked I thought it was a fluke and possibly because the bags were old. I ordered some new ones online, and out of 6 that I have used so far two have leaked. That's in addition to the one that leaked earlier, so the ""leakage rate"" of these so far has been 1 out of 3. At least it forces me to thoroughly clean my fridge shelves!The only reason I gave two stars is that I do like the space on top to label it so that there's no chance of permanent marker leaching through to the milk.I even double-checked to make sure these are actually freezer bags, and it says they are freezer safe right on the package! I'm definitely not thrilled to 1. lose ounces of milk that took a while to save up, 2. have to clean milk off my fridge and the food in it!"
5,These are great and convenient!,I purchased these bags before I went back to work so I could pump and still give my baby breast milk. I typically store between 3 and 4oz and have never had an issue with leaking. I store them in separate container in our freezer and then thaw them out in warm water and I have never had an issue with them. These are wonderful and I would highly recommend them!
2,Not much help if your bed is not sealed completely.,"I installed product to keep some dust out, but instead created another place for it to rest. Unless you completely seal your bed seams, which would allow water and moisture to rest, do not waste your time with this product."
3,works so so,"Does a so so job, You have to make sure the tailgate is shut tight. Then with preasure on it, it's hard to open."
3,Extange MaxSeal Tailgate Seal,"Seal was relatively easy to install, but is not staying in place, particularly near a bracket. Does seem to work OK to keep out dust, etc."
1,WAST OF MONEY,"Despite of the price, wich is not really too high, I was expecting such a great product. I aplied it following all the instructions and it didn't lasted for more than two weeks. It didn't stick well to truck bed."
5,Excellent book,Definitely a page turner from cover to cover. Dick Morris calls it what it is. He exposes those who wish to do harm whereas others are scared to offend someone.
1,OFF WITH ALL THEIR HEADS,"I read about 50 pages of this book and could take no more. Dick Morris should know deception when he sees it. How about a guy who solicits ladies of the evening while serving in government and writing this book? Fine man who is right where he belongs, on the FAUX NEWS CHANNEL in such fine company as William J. Bennett (Virtuous High Roller), Newt Gingrich (intern doer), Sean Hannity (propagada merchant), and Bill O'Reilly (pathological liar). Completely discredited. I say off with ALLtheir heads."
3,Dick Morris?,"The problem I have with people like Dick Morris is that they are largely responsible for why this nation is in the condition it is in. You never heard him say anything about the Clinton abuses when he was on board with them. Unfortunately, in my opinion, he abdicated his right to criticize or make money from his political views when he fails to accept the responsibility for his own contributions to the problems. Political spinmeisters like Morris are a big part of the problem. They can be bought for the right price...but won't stand up for the right purpose.Morris needs to stay quiet and stay home."
3,An Ax to Grind,"I admire to the fullest this clever insider to the beltway. I always read or listen to every word from him available to me. I am not planning to attack his intellect or his character here, as I am an avid admirer of both.What I found to be troubling was that toward the end of the book I began to get bored. It seemed Mr. Morris had a few axes to grind with the tobacco industry and other things too close to his heart to hold my interest. He spoke too emotionally, and in the process, didn't speak with the ferver that I have grown so accustomed to over the years. Dick, the book was a dissapointment, but you will still always be a must read, and one of my top analysts to listen too, and I am sure this is just a rare moment of extreme passion in your objectivity."
1,Clinton is responsible for terrorism?,"I stopped reading this Morris' illogical book when he accused Clinton of being responsible for terrorism.Was Morris really suggesting that terrorism didn't exist before the Clinton administration?After that stupidity, why would ANYBODY bother reading any further?"
3,not insightful,"Morris's book is weak on facts and weak on shrillness, and not ideologically based, basically its a big wandering tale of nothigness, railing against people that he is of the mark to rail against.He takes on the media when he should be taking on Hollywood and Chomsky. He takes on all manner of people while not focusing on the true hypcrisy in the leftist love of the hate for america found in Islam.Morris wrote this to capitalize on the sudden resurgence in conservative poplar literature and to capitalize on the money he could make by saying we should ""off the heads"" of the traitors. Coulters ""Treason"" is superior and so is ""In the path of god"" Islam and political power.This book is not helpful. But it is on the mark probably, since some of these liberals are traitors and should be sent to france."
1,It doesn't deserve one star,"Everyone needs to make a living, even self-destructive nuts like Morris. Talented? Yes, but nutty as a fruitcake. What was he was doing in that hotel?Off with their heads? Start here with Dick Morris, who fits his title as few others can."
2,insightful if not pompous,This guy has something to prove - his exaggeration and claims of prescience are simply embarrassing.
1,Right wing nutball,"As usual the right wing blames everything on Bill Clinton, ignoring the obvious fact that clinton is a top 5 president of all time, this coming from a moderate republican, me. The far right gets so carried away, it ruins the cause for the realistic moderates. Mr. Morris is mad as hell because he does not understand too many basic principles of human nature and economics. What we should all be reading about is how to get the rules written to get President Clinton back in office to get this economy going like he did before!"
1,Dick Morris' game,"When Morris recently appeared on a talk show, the inteviewer went along with Morris' line of thought, and then continued by saying ""So basically what you say depends on who is paying you"".It took Morris about 10 seconds to realize what was going, indicating that in fact the interviewer had correctly identified Morris' game.So it is with the latest book by Dick Morris.Recall that his zipper problems got him fired from the Clinton team. Imagine that.Remember: The Right wing lies. They just want to take your money so they can buy drugs, gamble, or work with an employee from the oldest profession. Ignore them!"
5,You can't make this stuff up...,"What a great read --- made all the better by the fact that it is all true. I started the book on Saturday and finished it last night. I am not normally attracted to non-fiction crime books but this book grabbed me right from the beginning. I was particularly impressed by the journal entries Captain Loughlin made while he was working the case. His compassion and concern for the victim and her family is very moving. The writing is clear, straight-forward and elegant. This book is profoundly moving all the more for being real. It has everything --- a truly innocent victim, an extremely perverse killer, an intelligent and dedicated police force. Fiction should be this good!"
5,Finding Amy,could not put this book down - had to keep reading to find out what happened. A true story - sad but riviting!
1,"Uninteresting book and definitely not ""gripping""!","This book is basically a chronicle of the murder of Amy St. Laurent - and it is a poorly written one at that. Footnoted information should have been incorporated into the text of the book, especially the part about part-time officer Ryan Campbell. And there is absolutely no suspense whatsoever - it is know almost immediately who committed the crime. As far as the crime itself, I find it appalling that it was months before anybody actually searched the location where Amy's body was found. It was an obvious location and was the first place that came to my mind. Also found the two-person narrative distracting and uneven. If you are really interested in reading about the Amy St. Laurent murder, read about it on the internet. It will be a more interesting read."
3,Missing Person,"Through no fault of the author, I was somewhat disappointed in this book. I was actually told about this book on a website dealing with illegal drugs, but when finished with the book, it wasn't as billed on the website."
2,A Boring Read - Could Barely Finish,"I am a avid reader of true stories and have read many books in this genre over the years. This one was slow-moving and basically you knew who did it from the very eaerly pages. There was no mystery, just lots of dragging boring details."
4,Finding Amy,"This was a good, although heart-wrenching, book. It's amazing how well the different law enforcement agencies worked together."
4,Good read with some filler,"I became intrigued to read this book when I saw Amy's story on the ID Network. The book is factual and gives even more detail into the investigation and trial. It gives a great in more in depth picture of who Amy was and what she meant to people. It also gives a good look at a cold killer. There are some slow parts that seemed to be filler, but if you can get through that you find this to be an incredible read and story."
3,"Modulator works great, low quality cable.","The FM modulator works great, but the cable is low quality and will most likely need replaced not long after purchase."
3,good way to learn but not real muppets,this is a exellent way to get your kids to learn to read. I have had this video since I was young and I must warn any one who wants to get this video that this is simply taped pictures out of a book. The characters do not move and are not even real muppets. If u r looking for muppet videos don't get this but if u r trying to get ur kids to read u should get this.
2,DO NOT BUY,"Ordered off Amazon. It seems sturdy, but the lighting is cheap and mine flickers and gets dim for no reason."
3,Frustrating,"Like this flashlight very much. Great amount of light for it's handy size. Solid construction (externally), but experiencing the same frustrating intermittent light problem reported by other buyers. Wish the marketer, and seller would pressure the manufacturer to correct the problem."
2,"It works, kinda....","this light is great when its working, but it cuts on and off and i can't figure out why. when i first got it i couldn't get it to turn on and i found out that you have to have the cap on really tight for it to work, but later when i actually needed it i couldn't get it to work right. it'll stay on for a while, then turn off and i have to mess with it for a couple of minutes for it to turn back on. i haven't figured out the trick yet."
4,Flickering Lights,I've had this flashlight for at least three weeks now and while most of the time it provides a very bright light usually there is a noticeable flicker. Otherwise the flashlight does it's job though it would be nice both the base and the head were detachable as opposed to only the base. There is a review in the gunmetal silver version of this flashlight where the reviewer talks about soldering over the original printed circuit board (PCB) with copper which eliminates the flickering but the PCB is located at the head of the flashlight so I am unsure as to how he got to it.
3,It had some issues,For the price its a very bright and cool designed flashlight. However the power button cove came the back after about 2 weeks. the button on the back looks pretty ugly so i switched it with a much nicer looking and performing button from another 9 LED flashlight laying around. Supper Bright light Quality wise its pretty bright. For the price it's Really Great.
1,Not good,It broke in two weeks ..it would shut off when you shake it ..the inside looks like a 5th grader made it in class for a project ...
2,get what you pay for flashlight,Only works correctly for a short time then you have to tap it or hit it to make the light come on and then a few seconds later it goes off and you have to repete the process.
2,O.K.,"Quality of light is good. The switch is inconsistent. Still, going to keep it as a casual use item around the house. The price was good."
1,super bright 9 led light,"save your money your hand will get sore from beating on the switch to make it com on.the switch is a push button it does'nt make good contact,the light goes on AND off.my advice is if it is push button don't buy it,ihave two of them."
2,"Bought Two Flashlights. One worked, one did not.","I bought two of these flashlights. My roomate and I work as security at a nightclub and we needed flashlights. One worked great, the other had maybe 1/4th of the brightness the other had. I returned one for a refund."
1,Excessive shipping charge - bait and switch on premium,"A shipping charge of $7.69 is truly excessive for four little flashlights.Beware of vendors selling cheap merchandise with high ""shipping"" charges -- it is really an upcharge or markup in disguise.Amazon should get wise to this and outlaw it before their reputation and customer base suffer."
3,Good little light.,"This is a good light. The LED is very bright and the batteries last forever. The case is light and works well in pocket or purse. The light is bright, but it is not a focused beam like a Mag-light. It also tends to wash out colors like a florescent light, but it does throw out a good deal of light."
4,Good useful litle light,This light is nice and handle for small situations. I keep it in my car. I shines nice & bright but not far.
1,Defective,"I bought a couple of these, two of them only work now if I beat them on something first. Something is loose inside...."
2,They are great when they actually work,"Some work...and some do not. The most annoying thing to me though, is the way the light will just cut out for no reason....and if you tap it good...it comes back on for a bit...then pulls the same stunt again. These are handy for odd jobs around the house...but do not work too awfully well actually. I would not wish to depend on any of these, to get me out of the deep woods after dark."
3,"bright, small and compact.","For the size, it is super bright. It is small and compact and fits in a back pocket. great buy."
2,Switch is not reliable,The push button switch does not always work. Have to mess with it and unscrew and rescrew the battery compartment part. Nice size and has enough light so I can see the buttons on the remotes controls when the room lights are dim and I am watching/listening the TV/DVD/CD. I would not buy a second unit of the same device.
2,"Cheap, that's for sure.","Bought this light for a 3 week trek in Norway. 2 days into my journey this light began to flicker and I had to bash it to get it to come back on. If I hung it in my tent for a little light and it hung motionless it was bright. It is bright but certainly cheap, do yourself a favor and spend a little more for something functional."
2,Arrived with dead batteries,"Pros- LED's are bright enough to light up a room- cheapCons- 3 AAA batteries arrived with the package were dead already- flimsy on/off button- came with a lanyard, no idea where does it go in!"
2,"Get a Dorcy or Fenix, still very cheap..tons better quality","This torch is cheap enough that you probably would not necessarily be dissappointed, but after I got this I discovered Dorcy and Fenix brands so this one will be regulated to a very non-critical bag or drawer.If I had to say something nice, it is very light. That is about it for the positive aspect. The idea of all the LEDs was appealing to me until the first bulb went out after twenty minutes of use, and two more were out before the first set of batts ran out.It is just crappy quality and I have a single lamp, 1 AAA Fenix keychain light that seems just as bright.Spend a extra buck or two for kne of the other brands I mentioned, you may not be as impresses as I am, but at least they won't start failing on the first battery."
3,LED Flashlight,The on/off switch is made very cheap and doesn't last long but the light output is good
2,Great when it works.,"It's a great little flashlight. Sadly the interior connections are not done well on the one I got, so it occasionally shuts off or dims and you have to whack it to get it back to full power. Otherwise it produces a very nice light."
4,Good value,"Nicely made flashlight for not much more than the price of the included batteries. I had to buy one for every family member. You have to read the warning label, it's a hoot. Made in China, of course."
2,Quality issue,"Bought this to have in my car for emergency purposes, yet wanted to tested on the house !!.The ilumination is great, with a very need white light, yet about two weeks it would not turn on .. and need to shake it for it to start.At first, just taking the batteries out, would work, but then it just would not turn on !!!"
3,Works in a pinch,"I keep this hanging on a nail in a dark closet, to help see what is there. It is not very bright, but is good enough to figure out what I am looking at. There are better options out there."
2,"Bought two, one worked","We bought two of these, one as a gift and one for my hubbie. I'm glad my hubbie opened his first because it didn't work. We opened the other one and it did, so we gave it on to the recipient. After messing around with hubbie's we got it to work - so if you're not afraid of playing with some electronics, go for it, otherwise - get something else."
5,"Sturdy, Long Battery life","The torch feels very sturdy in hand, the illumination is great and battery life good. What else could you ask for."
4,Great,These little flashlights are superb. They are well made and work better than one I have that cost four times as much. It is a real brain teaser to figure out where the lanyard goes -- there is no hole for mounting.
2,Poor quality,"This is a really cheaply made flashlight, even for 5 bucks. Unless you just need a throw away item, spend a few bucks more. I could find no way to attach the included carry strap, nor does it have a momentary on/off as described on the package.On the plus side it is fairly bright, and like most LED lights, will last a long time on set of batteries."
2,Can't beat the price for an aluminum flashlight or can you?,Purchased with an in store credit at Walgreens. What can you say about a $4.99 flashlight that works. I'll tell you what you can say... It works but would not want to depend on it to light up a work or emergency area. If your reading this far then you probably know there are hundreds of manufactures Making these things so shop around. I will say for the money the battery life is above average and years later it keeps on ticking. Just gave mine to my girlfriend and replaced it with a Maglite for $8.95 at Lowes. (Yes my girlfriend got a new Maglite also.
4,good but,"it needs improvement. I'm very satisfied with the brightness of the light for this size and price. It's very portable that it does not bother me even in the pocket. Mine does not show any mechanical or electrical problems but the light flickers very often. When I focus on something and the light flickers, it's very difficult to do fine jobs.But I've noticed that this flickering is a typical problem for most of LED."
4,I was able to find my zipper.,"Well this is a very light flashlight, but it serves it's purpose at night. It's bright enough to find anything in the dark at a distance and I was able to use it to check my fuses under my dash. Would recomend for anyone who wants something really cheap in price but does the job."
5,"Cheap, Bright, and Durable","I don't know much about flashlights, I cannot tell you exactly how many lumens this puts out or how excellent the beam distribution is. What I can say is that as an engineer that works in dim, confined, and sometimes wet, spaces this light is ideal. It's bright, lasts more hours than I have counted on its 3 AAA batteries, and it's at minimum splash proof as mine has been dropped in several puddles and still works.It's also very durable, mine rattles around in the bottom of my tool bag with hammers, wrenches, and pry-bars, and does not mind at all."
2,Quality expected with price,"I anticipated the quality of this flashlight to suffer due to the low price. I ordered two that worked for a while, but within a few months of very light use, the flashlights started to short out when held in a normal way. This was tested on both flashlights with the same result. I'd recommend spending a few more dollars on a better quality flashlight."
3,Will serve its intended purpose,"I needed something small that i could just leave in the car's glove box in case i ever had to stop at night and have to look under the hood. I was not impressed by the quality of this flashlight, and the light it makes is disappointing for LED technology, but it will do for what i need, and with its current price tag i cannot complain too much.If you're looking for a quality flashlight though, this is unfortunately not your stop."
5,awesome,"This is the best dam light for $5.30, Its much easier to handle at night then my mag light. Its very bright for its size and sits right next to my bed with my gun, if I shine it in somebodys eyes it temp. blinds them.I love this light and gettin more..."
5,Works + Bright,"It works and it's bright. I don't want much more from a flashlight.Based on the warning that came with it I'd imagine some of the inner casing (certainly not the shell, it's too light) is made of lead. This isn't ideal; but as someone who works with lead-based solder, I'm not too concerned."
1,Does not work,Do not buy. This does not work. Tested batteries and they each had a full charge-so it's not the batteries which are at fault
5,"Good value, Good light","So far I am pleased with this 9 LED flashlight. It is short and easy to hold, All the LEDs light and the light is bright. The Amazon price is definitely right. In fact after writing this review I am getting a second one for my car."
3,"Bright, but a little flakey","This flashlight produces a very bright beam. I don't know how long the batteries last, but I'm sure it's far better than incandescent bulb flashlights. I've noticed that the circuit can be a little flaky at times and when dropped or jarred you may have to re-tighten the battery pack, but that might just be my unit."
1,Doesn't cost much or do much,"This baby sure was cheap, in both senses of the word. It doesn't project light at all. It may be good for finding keys in a purse, but don't count on it to shine more than 6 inches...not worth the price."
1,did not work at all,We opened the box and put it all together and still dont work. New batteries didnt work either. Going to send back....
1,The thing did not work.,"simple little device, but even changing the batteries, switching the battery pack around to ensure that a contact was made could not raise a single lumen. sent it back, of which I received no credit. scam."
2,Poor Quality,"Since the day I bought it, had to shake it to make it light up, then the lens falls out and won't stay in...had to jam it in with paper, pretty bright for the size though."
3,Ok for the money,"The compact flashlight puts out a decent light and will be good for a camping light. The rubber cover for the switch will not stay on unless I glue it, or something, but that is not a huge deal. For the money, I am glad I bought it."
4,Dim-lit,"Decent for the price, not as bright as I would have suspected. Don't count on the batteries that are supplied. Even with low consumption, the generic batteries provided do not last long. 3AAA's required. Should have been in ""AA"" battery size. I find that it's a little too short for my hands."
2,"Poor build quality, cheap product","I bought these for relative's kids. They liked it. It was good deal.But this product is just made in China quality. It doesn't last long! Just for one time use.in this build quality, $2-3 is proper deal."
2,Had to fix it right out of the package,"Upon opening the package and inserting the batteries the light did not work. I checked a few things and found that the housing for the batteries has a pin at the top and that you do not get all of the voltage from the batteries unless it is fully compressed. What I did was pull the spring from the end cap out and this was enough to push the battery pin in when I reassembled the light. It's still cheap and a decent little light, but I wouldn't rely on it too much if it doesn't work right out of the package."
5,Nothing but,"As Mac Rebennack he built a solid reputation as an inspired session player, able to inject a little New Orleans life into any song. As Dr. John, the Night Tripper he earned a small, devoted following and one hit record, ""Right Place, Wrong Time."" In 1981, he dropped the voodoo trappings of his stage act, sat down at the piano and played this lovely set of original tunes and New Orleans standards. The piano work here is less ornate that of Rebennack's predecessors, Professor Longhair and Tuts Washington, but every note sounds heartfelt. For those who think of Dr. John as a funky New Orleans singer, this album will demonstrate his solid musicianship and his abilities as a tunesmith. Out of print for several years, this remastered recording adds a few unreleased tunes and makes one of the great moments in Dr. John's brilliant career available once again."
5,Dr. John plays classic New Orleans blues piano with style!,"Dr. John can rock a piano like nobody I know. Blues classics and some of his own renditions make this album an enjoyable treat to anyone who loves blues piano, New Orleans style. The next best thing to being there!"
5,Dr.John and his Piano!,"Ohhhhhhhhhh, Yeah! Simply amazing. Can't believe Dr. John has only ten fingers because he's all OVER that keyboard on any one song. ""Dorothy"" is simply beautiful and starts and ends Vol.1, but the whole of the album is nothing short of amazing. THIS is piano playing at its best. He's a virtuoso who can play anything and wouldn't be the least surprised to hear him launch into classical music. I think this man could do anything on the piano and though he's quoted as having said ""I've done that"" as far as simply recording his solo performances on the piano....a man can change his mind, can't he? and there's a whole lot of us hoping he will. Stunning work!"
5,One of my very favorite Dr. John recordings,"I have listened to Dr. John with pleasure for many years, but this recording has to be his best. Complete solo piano by the man himself, in only the way that Dr. John can do it. I just marvel at this man's talent, especially after listening to this CD. Highly recommend!!!"
4,Daughter Loves It.,My 3 year old loves it. It has very little space for a back pack to keep little snacks or toys but she likes it.
3,Pretty but it's a little short to make much of an impression,At 20 minutes this single is pretty and hypnotic but it needs a couple more tracks to make a real impact but for what it is it deserves to be listened to. Those interested in Add N to X and/or Fuxa should be interested in this but ultimately it's too short for my likingIt does make me interested to see what Fuxa sound like though so maybe it has something
5,Terrific Read!,I loved this book. I was leary of the subject matter but I have read three of Ms. Gutcheon's books and have enjoyed all of them enormously. This was the best of the lot.
2,Wish this book was missing...,"I found this book was the basis for the TV movie ""Without A Trace"" and decided to read it. What a disappointment. The book does hit some home runs when it comes to describing the mother's feelings and reactions but overall, the characters are shallow, undeveloped and stereotypical. I also found the writing to be very poor in most places, even amateurish. The book was more like a high school student reading about Etan Patz (real life disappearance)and writing about it for a composition class. The low point is the ending, which I won't give away. Aside from being highly improbable, it felt very rushed, abrupt and WAY predictable. When an author spends more time and effort describing an encounter with a homosexual prostitute than in a book's conclusion, there is something wrong. I have never read Gutcheon's work before; ""Still Missing"" would not make me seek her out again."
3,...,Little Alex is missing. Who kidnapped him? The gay housekeeper is immediately suspect... It is true that the man certainly appeared suspect due to the sexually explicit materials about men and boys that was found among his possessions. His false French accent and deceit about his credentials certainly painted a grim picture...This is more suitable for television that book format as you can finish the movie within 2 hours and feel you haven't wasted much time.
5,Missing and I found it!!,"This book has been missing from my book collection and now I have it. I read this book a few years back, but i remember it dearly. I cried and was in shock pretty much while reading this. I still can't believe how it ended. I cried!!! (Sorry no hints)!! Written 22 years ago and its like it was written this year."
4,Still Missing,This is the first book I have read from Gutcheon and I really enjoyed it. Her character development was great and after a while I could not stop cheering for the mother. I was glad that the book ended on a postive note after investing that much time into reading it I would have been very upset if the boy was never found or had died. I really felt like I was part of the book.
5,Pretty good ELP CD/DVD release IMHO,"I am 19 and am a huge ELP fan, I was very surprised to hear they released a DualDisc album of the gig at Isle Of Wight. The sound quality of the recordings are outstanding. Those three guys weren't that bad at all, this blows me away of how great they're introduction worldwide was. The DVD was interesting to me, you get to see recent interviews with Emerson, Lake & Palmer themselves and see footage of Isle Of Wight Festival. I would recommend this to anyone that likes ELP that dont have the recording of them of Isle Of Wight or people that wanna be introduced into theyre music. Long live ELP!"
4,ELP-In The Beginning,"This release takes you back to their birth. It is amazing to see how comfortable they were with stage, the audience, and each other, so early on. The concert footage is pretty darn good considering the time it was recorded. The background of the concert, the event, and the interspersed interviews with the members of ELP (in 2005 when this was released) really help to give you insight into where they were as individuals, what they hoped to achieve, the luck they knew they had in their timing and venue; and their surprise of the world-wide reaction immediately after that concert.Whether you are a fan or not this is great entertainment. It will bring you back to the greatest live concert event to date."
3,"Some were really good, most were just OK.","Given the price, these should have been really flavorful. A few were, but most were very average. They are better than what is available at a grocery store."
3,Some good comedy monologs if you like George Burns,"What does a man who is 88 have to be happy about? Well at 88, George Burns finds enough to be happy about to fill a book with jokes and tongue-in-cheek advice on happiness.Don't read the book to find the secret of happiness because most of his advice is simplistic and written to get a laugh rather than to enlighten. However, if you like George Burns as a stand-up comic, then you should find plenty in this text to amuse you.There are over 40 full-page black and white photos of George Burns with famous friends, his staff, stills from his movies and nightclub acts, and photos of him with four female models posing as either patients or nurses. These cheesecake photos are the worst part of the book.At the end of the book he names all the people, including the writers and models who helped him with it. Since everything he says is a joke, you can't count on the book as a reliable memoir, so read it only for its amusement value."
3,fun romp,"I enjoyed this book. The characters are engaging, the ideas are clever, and the mysteries are well crafted. There is nothing to dislike about this book!On the other hand, there's nothing to set the book apart from hundreds of others I've read. It's not a ""must read"" book.My advice: buy it and keep it around for the next time you need some light, escapist reading. You'll enjoy it, but you won't fall in love with it."
5,Previous poster is wrong about translation,"It is common knowledge that an article needs to be placed in front of nouns in Spanish and that this is not necessary for English nouns. It is absolutely correct that this was done in this book.""Color café"" is a term used quite often throughout Latin America, but especially in Mexico and Central America, to mean brown."
5,Simple but effective,This board book illustrates objects little ones are sure to recognize with their colors in both Spanish and English. This is a great book for bilingual households where one parent speaks exclusively Spanish and the other speaks exclusively English or any household in which the caregivers want to expose their charges to Spanish and English.
2,Didn't work very well for us,"This didn't work very well for us, it has no way to seal and hair still gets down the drain. Maybe it works for a different kind of tub, but I don't see how it would without having a way to ""suction"" or flex enough, without breaking like ours did."
5,Excellent service,"The product arrived promptly. It will be used to refill the jar-like bottle of the same lotion. I like the the way it smells--it is exotic and clean at the same time, and layers well with refined unisex musks."
3,cheap and works,Cheap replacement cable for a clients system. These can be made very easily but I always buy product for clients systems. System has had no problems since it was installed. That's obviously what you want.
1,Very vague and broad,"I was very excited when I saw this book hoping it'd open me all of the secrets of not-known-until-now world of HDL Synthesis. How wrong I was. The title is very misleading, the book spends just a few pages on synthesis. Overall, this book might be useful for a novice, but even for me, an undergrad ECE major, it turned out to be almost useless. It contains minimum of factual information, often outdated(and this is critical in the ECE world), and only slightly touches the surface on a number of topics it tries to cover. I think the authors whould have concentrated on something specific, instead of giving ""what happened in Computer Engineering in last 15 years"" review."
2,"Less and more, Richard!","I am having trouble understanding the good reviews. This is a paper mill book that is rushed to press to get it out there before the next version of Flash comes out.It starts out slow, too slow, and then accelerates into oblivion, with information that could be useful, however isn't reinforced enough by the exercises or further explannation. If one is to learn independently, there needs to be many more exercises reinforcing less content.There is a nice format and THAT has merrit, but due to the numerous errors (mostly omitting instruction steps) I have found this book to be detrimental to learning Flash.Who wrote those reviews, anyway?"
2,Disappointing,"I was VERY dissapointed with this series. My daughter read this book in a class designed around it. She told me that everyone in the class, including the teacher, disliked the books and thought them to be quite boring. The book has a very nice Christian message, but does nothing to keep your attention. The book would go on and on for pages about the same topic and was very wordy. All of the reviews and descriptions are very misleading. I have heard that the Elsie series (that was actually written by Martha Finley) were very good and I imagine that is why the Violet series was so bad. Martha Finley did not write them! In the end, I do not recommend this book."
3,Wellll...,"A lot of other people liked it, so don't consider only this review or anything, but I thought the book was pretty boring. The first third or so I got through kind of quickly, but after that I got a lot slower. It was nice pretending to be Vi during the last third of the book though. :) But overall, I'm not excited about reading the rest of the books, and I probably won't. Then again, I am 14. Oh well. I hope you like it!"
3,Policy Studies,This was one of the most uninspiring books I have read. It was a monotoned read. It did not hold my interest. Maybe because I have had classes similar to this with books that were more interesting.
3,Pretty good order,"I ordered the book in hardback, but I received a paperback because the hardback was damaged. It was said to be a first edition, which was good."
3,It's okay but just barrow it from the library.,I am 17 years old. 3 stars. This book is good but it has some really sick parts. The girl was really mean to the guy in the beginning but he still loved her and thats why I liked the book. Some of the gross parts were when the guys out in the woods caught the older guy and plucked out his eyeball. That was really gross. They didn't need to describe how they plucked out his eyeballs. It was kind of scary too because at one point the people thought that the girl was a witch. I liked this book because it had the boy and girl liking eachother and their problems.
2,Not Much Blast,This fan is less than OK. Not very powerful. Too expensive. Wish I had thought twice.
1,Get Prevage MD instead...it is double-strength and cheaper!,"I can't believe how much amazon and other retail stores (like sephora)charge for this. I buy Prevage MD (which is double the strength of regular Prevage) from my plastic surgeon's office and I only pay 120$. Why would you pay 30 dollars more for something that is only half the strength of the good stuff? If you don't want to go to the doctor to buy the MD version, then you can get it off ebay for around 100$..."
4,Very good skincare product,"I have used both the .5% Prevage and the 1.0% Prevage MD. I prefer the half-strength for a couple of reasons. First, with the .5%, you get almost twice as much (1.7 oz versus 1.0 oz) and, as such, I felt more comfortable using more product - 2 pumps twice a day as opposed to 2 pumps at night for the MD. Using the product this way got much better results for my skin - with the MD, it felt drier and itchier and it didn't seem to work as well. However, I am sure it varies with individual skin types. This product is not going to replicate the effects you'd get with a few well-placed injections, but for me, it really does firm up my skin a bit and soften some lines. As I haven't had a full night's sleep in about 2 years due to birthing babies, I am going to try the eye treatment as well. (Although honestly, I'd prefer a month of sleep!)"
1,Defective from Be Bold Store,I have used this product for some time. I really like it. I ordered online from Be Bold Store. It arrived defective. The color is normally a transparent peach. The product from Be Bold Store was brown and not transparent. I contacted Be Bold store multiple times for a replacement. They do not respond.Good product. Bad seller.
1,product was old,"I have had the worst luck with this product. Prior to this I had to send it back because it was black instead of gold in color and had a foul odor (like rotting skin) This order was the same, I just threw it away and will not be ordering it again through ANYONE! YOU pay for what you get and this case I have learned my lesson!"
2,"Very costly, no effect","My experience: I heard such great things about Prevage - restores youthful skin, reverses damage, etc., I couldn't wait until it was available. Finally, I was able to buy it - nice packaging, great dispenser of just the right amount. After two months, I found it to be only a great under makeup moisterizer, and there are plenty of others of equal efficacy for 1/10 the price - Eucerin, for instance. Kinerase did nothing for me either, so it may just be me - just fyi - fair, sensitive dry skin, middle aged."
3,Too early to tell,"I've been using the product for a few weeks, haven't noticed much other than a strange odor. I'm hoping since I paid so much I haven't gotten a bad batch."
4,Prevage Anti Aging Face,Always loved the product. This time though the color was brown & smells awful! That only means it's old but it should still work.
3,Old Product :(,"If it's too good to be true, it probably is. Sadly, this was the case with this. It came today in an unopened box and sealed in its capsule. I should have caught on to the brittle tape that sealed the capsule but I was blinded by my excitement. The serum was brown and smelled funny. Wasn't sure if this was normal since some products like Perricone MD have awful odors, but upon investigating, it should be a mustardy color and have no smell. Bummer :( ....UPDATE- I was refunded my money for the unsatisfactory product and received an apologetic email stating they do not intend to send poor product. :)"
2,Prevage is not for everyone,"I have received a complimentatary size Prevage pump. I have used it in the evening because I wanted my skin to enjoy anti-aging effects overnight. Skin was visibly soft and wonderfully moisturized in the morning. However, several days after using it consistently once a day in the evening, I started getting pimples. Whatever active ingredient is for this product, my skin is reversing to puberty. I have not exactly wanted my anti-aging products to go that far back in time."
2,Prevage gave me blackheads!,"I tried using Elizabeth Arden's Prevage for about 3 months. While I did see a little change in skin tone (e.g., it is less dull) I had to quit using it as my face became COVERED in blackheads (I assume this cream clogged my pores?)."
4,"This is good, but Derma Step is still the best!","I had tried all kinds of skin care systems, with different levels of success, but in the end, the Derma Step system works the best, with long lasting results. You can get a free trial and see for yourself here: stuffgratis.biz/dermastep"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED...,"As a longtime Paul Mitchell product user, I was very disappointed in the Super Skinny Shampoo and the Super Skinny Conditioner. Both seem to leave leave buildup no matter how long or how many times I rinse. I even tried watering down a small portion so that I would not be putting a thick clump anywhere on my hair and it still seemed to leave behind residue. I tried the Shampoo alone and it still did it and the Conditioner seemed to make it worse! I don't see how anyone could praise the Super Skinny Shampoo & Conditioner... i liken it to putting crisco on my head. I LOVE the Super Skinny Serum but would not recommend the matching Super Skinny Shampoo or Super Skinny Conditioner to my worst enemy. For the record I bought my products from a licensed salon and Paul Mitchell seller and both the shampoo and conditioner were confirmed to be fresh purchases from them. I will continue being a loyal user of the Original and Awapuhui line from Paul Mitchell."
1,Not good,"I think it's old or i was sent something else. Compared the color and the smell to a bottle i have and its different.Have been using this product for years, so i can tell it's not the same, but i will use it once and see what happens. I know exactly how my hair should come out,"
1,Build up,"I bought this elsewhere so my review isn't about Amazon service, strictly about this product. I've used the conditioner and like the other review it doesn't matter how little I use or how much I rinse it leaves a thick ""build up"" residue all over my hair. I have thick wavy hair so my hair can use the extra conditioning... this made my hair dull and gross."
1,angry,I have used this product for years and have been extremely happy with the size and format. This year they changed it and there is only ONE page for every letter. Do people only have 8 contacts per letter? I can't find anything else this size (it fits in my purse) and I have to go to another product. You have lost me as a customer unless you change this format. So angry!
1,Waste of Money,"I was very disappointed when I received this replacement for my old Week-at-a-Glance address book. The old one had about three pages in each tabbed section, but this has only the tabbed pages. Nothing else. Yet it costs $11.86! There is hardly any space to write your information.Don't buy this - it will only make you as angry as it made me."
5,address refill,It is not possible to just buy the telephone/address insert in local stores. Thank you Amazon.
3,shirt,"product made of polyester, very hot but fits true to size. It snags very easily but a very nice color."
5,Fun puzzle!,Thanks for carrying this new Lauri puzzle. The kids at my preschool really enjoy playing with it.
4,Wilson finally sings some good tunes,"Nancy Wilson powerful and emotive jazzy pipes have long been wasted on pop trash the likes of which will never be recorded again. But this album, especially out her recent releases is as good as it gets and it's good. Wilson has fun with some superb styling and music by Mandel and Manilow. Her voice is well-suited to all the accompanied, which could have been sparser. Let's hope that Wilson goes into the studio soon to record some pop standards."
4,Same satin voice....,It is lways a pleasure to add to collection of Miss Nancy Wilson's well-sung tunes--love When October goes the most!
4,First music for the Cybermen,"The tracks on this CD are apparently off of stock music that the BBC had available in the early 60's. (You can even hear that the CD is copied off of LP tracks because of the occasional pop, but only if you listen with earphones.) Some of the tracks were used in the ""Tenth Planet"" and subsequent Cybermen stories of the 60's, including ""Tomb"". The CD is short, as are the tracks, but it is a rare example of early music used in Who."
4,Nice boot!,"These boots are really comfortable, and very stylish. I didn't have to break them in at all. I wear them all the time, and am looking to get another pair in a different color :)"
5,great boot!,This boot was comfortable right out of the box and I've gotten several compliments on how they look!
2,Not tough enough,Sled works great on firm deep snow. Does not hold up at all to any lumps & bumps.. such as pebbles or sticks. Sled shreds easily.
2,Not very happy,"I bought 2 of these for my daughters (8 and 9). After the first snow storm one of the handles broke off of one of the sleds. Before the season was over, both handles had broken off and my daughter was destroyed that her sister's didn't break. They treated them both the same. I was disappointed."
4,The furry friends aboard Titanic,"I love books about the Titanic, but I've never read one that really told about the dogs that were on board. Indeed, there was a dog kennel on the Titanic!Sam Harris is a young boy in 1912 traveling on the Titanic. He has a sharp eye for dogs and always enjoys having fun. He makes friends with the boy who works in the ship's kennel, Phineas MacDonald. Together, with Sam's friend, Bucky, these boys create their own adventures aboard the ship (mostly adventures which include dogs).White Star is the name of the beautiful Irish setter which immediately becomes attached to Sam. However, it's the Titanic owner's dog, so Sam knows that their time together is short.It's a quick, fun book. Most suitable for ages 9-14. The story is dominantly about boys, but girls would enjoy reading ""White Star: A Dog on the Titanic"" too."
5,Excellent Customer Service,I needed the books quickly - they arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I would use this seller again.
3,White Star Review,"I am glad I got the book on time, and it was worth it for how much I paid, but it was in terrible condition, despite being called ""in very good condition."" I was overall dissappointed in the appearance of the book, but it works well enough to pay my sister back because I lost her book. I definitely will not be buying from Amazon any time soon. :("
2,RABID,OKAY movie. It depends if you want to spend money on it. I probably will not rent again or buy. I thought she grew up in a cage and the movie takes you down a wrong turn. Exciting you then finding out she can hear and barely speak. I thought she would be wither in pain or think it was normal living in and out of a cage. The movie takes the viewer then out of movie.
1,Disapointing,"After just seeing a fun Troma film that was a great little retro 80s movie, we get this, which is total junk. I was so disappointed. Granted i knew it wasn't going to be deep or anything, but it didn't even deliver on the violence, nudity and gore one would expect. Sucked."
1,Misleading product name. DO NOT BUY!,This item did not work with my 2003 Tiburon. It simply is not the harness which goes with the Tiburon. I ended up buying the proper sized one from Crutchfield.
1,Don't buy!,This DVD is not the original Rock And Roll Music DVD it has partsof the concert mixed with slide show pictures of Chuck Berry as he looks nowin his 80's with recorded songs mixed in.The video quality is horrible. I can't say it'sa bootleg but it sure looks like one and it also has a different DVDjacket and dvd label on the disk than the original.I will be returning this item.
1,Software crashes!,"I decided to buy this webcam as an upgrade to my new Logitech. The Logitech webcam worked but the software only outputs at 15 fps and wmv (I want avi). I emailed Logitech and they said that this is all their software supported.The software install for this Creative webcam is long and complicated. When I try to use the software I get a notice to report the error to Microsoft and the computer locks up. If I do not use the software but leave the webcam plugged in I hear the Windows sound of the device constantly connecting and disconnecting. This stops when I unplug the webcam. I wrote support and they blamed my computer, which is high end and runs everything else.I actually prefer the Logitech QuickCam Orbit MP camera itself. It is heavier with a solid base that stays in place.I do not know why both companies cannot provide good software that works. It is pitiful that they are making good cameras with software that is unusable."
2,What a way to disappoint,"The idea is great, the reality is that you may never get to see how good (or bad) this webcam is.This is the most difficult software package i have ever had to deal with. After a 45 minute load time, you have 95% chance of getting a bad install and nothing is going to work. Install, uninstall, reinstall, nothing will help you. 12 hours later and the same error messages, over and over. To add interest, it destroyed the drivers for my scanner and printer. Oh joy, hope i can get those working again.If you do get the install to work, you will be disappointed by the weak clip, which is intended to hold the cam in place atop your computer. It does, but just barely. Don't move your screen, or you will have a meeting of keyboard and cam.As usual they have taken a great idea, cool looking design (it really is cool looking), and paired it with a POS software.If you buy this, good luck and may the force be with you, you'll need it."
2,Web Cam Review,"The new Web Cam I bought is very hard to get working.You first have to understand thah it works with a site they have set up I beleve they call it Sight Speed or something of that nature, I just call it SS. I bought a Web Cam so that I could use it on Yahoo I M but I can not use this camera there as every time I try it just locks up everything on Yahoo and I have to shut down my computer and restart it to restore every thing. I have tried everything to get this Web Cam to work on Yahoo I M with no success. So my advice to who ever is looking for a Web Cam to use on say Yahoo or any other established Internet is DO NOT BUY THIS WEB CAM as it only works on SS and the sound leaves a lot to be desired it is not that good. I beleve they are just trying to interdouce this Web Cam to drive people to there SS Room."
2,Support for Mac OS X Questionable,"This is a very stylish camera. The manufacturer claims that its compatible with OS X (10.4.9 and later) but I've experienced one very annoying problem with it. My Mac will not recognize the camera after it awakes from sleep. I'm running Leopard (10.5.1). I have to reseat the USB 2.0 plug if I want to use the camera after my Mac wakes from sleep. Aside from this, the camera works great. I'm satisfied with image and sound quality. In this regard, the camera lives up to its promises. Unfortunately, the manufacturer does not do a good job responding to customers on its website (forums). I haven't been able to get any help. My final rating is sub-par because I'm a little disappointed. This problem should be solvable, but the manufacturer doesn't seem to care very much. I'd like to give a better rating because its a nice camera, but unfortunately, it doesn't work properly on the Mac."
2,Trial & Error,"My reasons for selecting this camera were because of the time lapse and motion detection features. I wasn't particularly interested in using it as a web cam. On the third or fourth try I finally got the time lapse mode to perform but could not see any way to change the interval from the default period of 30 seconds. My major complaint with this product is the total lack of an instruction manual with any useful information content at all. So you are stuck trying to figure it out by trial and error. Apparently the manufacturers approach is ""you bought it, you figure it out"". I plan to return it for a refund."
4,Works great with a PC,"The camera is easily adjustable via software to work in all enviroments. Autofocus works well. Unfortunately the software is PC only. The strength of this camera is the adjustability so I would skip this camera if one is using a Mac unless running Windows through Bootcamp, parallels or VM."
3,Not sure yet.,"So far I haven't been able to get this thing to work. The CD is not helping and it doesn't attach securely to my computer. I am giving it a 3 star review because most of the difficulties probably have to do with me being techno-challenged, but I'm not very hopeful at this point. If you're a computer geek you most likely won't have my problems."
3,"On a Mac, not so much ...","This camera takes a beautiful picture, but there is ZERO control of the cam in a Mac environment ... no control over exposure (which means you're hooped if there's 'too much' light in the room) and no control over video frame rate so you're stuck at 15 fps. Creative tech supports says, ""Thank you for your kind understanding."" Plug 'n play, but only just."
2,Creative Labs VF0280 Webcam,"Overall, a disappointment. Upside: works with Vista 64. Downside: autofocus feature continually hunting, not the greatest low light performance, and no way to preview using the included control software."
4,creative web cam,"Sound is good, I am having difficulty getting color to be actual but picture is clear"
4,adorable book,adorable book about a lil girl who wants to bring something really special to show and tell and decides a jar of rotten teeth is the best thing!
4,"Cute story, but may not want to read it if your child is afraid of the dentist",This is a cute story however it could scare a child into going to the dentist. A parent needs to make sure they add comments along the way that the child in the story is exaggerating the dental experience.
3,Okay for the price but you get what you pay for,"The tray helps the pads to be hold in place, but even that my hyper active yorkie always find a way to ripped it off out of the tray. However, this is my 2nd tray that I am ordering, the first one I ordered the little black screw under the pad that holds it in place got loose, and when I received the 2nd tray it came in with a missing screw, and both trays are wobling when my dogs walks on it. Anyways, now the screws are getting off the trays one by one. So, for the price is ok, I can always fill out the empty holes but it does hold the pads and I wouldn't buy more expensive pads than this."
2,Does not work,"the item is pretty flimsy, and my 7lb puppy can easily pull the pee pad out and chew it. The whole thing is plastic."
3,good construction,"The product seems solid. The top and bottom pieces fit together tightly to hold the pad in place. Unfortunately within 5 minutes my 8 month old pom had completely shredded the pad. So I tried putting a washable puppy pad [...] and it fit and was held snugly. But not snugly enough. I returned in another 5 minutes and puppy had the pad about halfway worked free. In all fairness I don't think there is any way to stop a determined dog from flipping, shredding, or generally making a mess of its pee pads."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"The snap part of the top is hard to close over a potty pad...and since my baby dog sometimes hits the edge of the pad as opposed to right in the center, I end up having to scrub this all the time to get the pee off. It is too much work to fasten & too much work to constantly wash. Good thing is was only about ten bucks!!!!"
5,crazy high price!,"I bought this item in Jan. 07, when it was priced at $6.99. For what I paid it is o.k., though the plastic tray bed is a bit warped. But the price has suddenly doubled -- take it from me, THIS TRAY IS NOT WORTH $14.99! I don't know what is going on at this company -- they also just doubled the price of their pee pads out of the blue. They have lost my business!"
5,Unless you LIKE urine on your floor...,"I have several small dogs I've trained using puppy pads. Usually their attempts to hit the pad have worked, but on occasion they have tinkled too close to the edges of the pad, resulting in spillage. As a result, I've had to wipe up numerous spills. This product arrived just in time. The dogs are now more restricted in their movement while doing their little bathroom dance. This is such a nice product as it also keeps the wet from running onto the floor! In addition, it the pad stays in place. Puppies at play no longer catch the pad and pull it over."
3,Space too small,"Even for my little 12 pound pug-a-poo this is not big enough for him to hit the mark. Training pads do work, though especially in those 20 inch snowstorms."
2,"Loved it, until my puppy chewed off the holders on the edges","It was super easy for my puppy at about 12 weeks to chew the little gray handle bar holders off and then it was a moot point. She had already started to pull the pee pad out sometimes. Otherwise it was a good product - no leaking through, good size for a puppy or small dog, good grip on the bottom, easy to use, etc."
3,too small,it is between the size of a whole pad and a half so really difficult to make a pad fit.My dogs want to urinate on the overlapping edges of the pad that is not on the tray.It is currently not being used.
4,handy problem solver,"I use pads for my litter box adverse cats. This helps keep them in place, through more than one use and encourage there continued use."
4,Iris protect tray - pet training pad holder,"This is a cheep version, but it does work good. The OUT training Pads we use are a bit big for it, but it works good. The only complaint I have is that its difficult to lock the pads in...the locking device is poorly made.[...]"
5,Love it!!,"This is a great invention! Now my puppy does not move her pad around in her pen. We also purchased theIRIS Plastic Exercise / Containment Pet Pen for Dogs, White. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FS4OYA/ref=cm_cr_mts_prod_imgThis is an awesome buy for people that work and the pad holder is great!!"
2,Poor quality,"I recently ordered this product hoping to prevent my puppy from playing with his training pad and trashing it all over the place, but was disappointed with the product once received. The product I received did not have a flat bottom, it was concave, so it wobbles and does not provide a firm surface for my puppy. Because of this it also moves around every time the puppy uses it and the poop gets thrown around.The locking mechanism was easily opened by the dog withing a few minutes of use. Maybe because of the misshapen base?Since I do not know if this is a product defect or this is how the product is supposed to be, I cannot give it a better rating or recommend it."
1,Did not work for me,My puppy would chew up the pee pad every time I secured them in this tray.She used them properly when I just placed them on the floor without this. So I only used the tray a few times. Waste of money for me.
1,Iris FT-500 Small Floor Protection Tray for Pet Training Pads,"This was a waste of my money. My dog will not go near it at all.Even with the Puppy Aid Spray, which is supposed to attract them to the pad, it was still ignored.Thank you."
1,Not for the dog who likes to shred the potty pads!,"I bought this with the hope that my dog would stop tearing apart the potty pads. I used it once and came home to a completely shredded pad. So if your dog tears up the pads and you were hoping this would prevent that, it didn't work for me! The product was sturdy and in good shape though, just did not function as intended."
2,Not worth it,The tray does not really hold the potty pads securly. It took almost nothing for my little 4 pound puppy to get the pee pads out of the tray and shred them.
4,Good product and service,"This product is easy to use, its use does not warrant any complexity whatsoever. Thanks you very much. Have a nice day."
4,Works great,We got this item for our new puppy who loved to tear up his pee pads. We were taping his pee pads to the ground but he would just rip them up instead of using them. We got the pee pad holder and it only took him a little while before he figured it out. Now he is using the pad and not ripping it up any more.
2,Pup refuses to Use,My 5 lb Poodle was puppypad trained by her previous owner. She always goes on her pad when I am not home to let her out. I thought this tray would be a good idea to protect my floor but I was wrong. The tray/pad moved the first time she stepped on it and scared her so now she will not step on it. She tinkles beside it but refuses to step back on the tray. O well I tried. It would probably be great for pups who are not already used to pads on the floor.
2,Tricky product title,"Do yourself a favor, and search for Iris Training Pad Holder, Regular. It's the same product, dimension, and cheaper. I got tricked by the description by not describing the dimension, just the size."
3,Not working in my favor,"I have had this product for over a month and I love this product, but my 2 doggies hate it. Only time will tell."
3,dog tray,if i could train my dog to go on it i would love it. does keep pad in place. good plastic. i assume easy clean up
2,Not for my puppy,"My dog only used this a few times. If she peed too close to the edge, it leaked out between the sides and onto the carpet. If you fold it up to move it, it is clumsy because there is no way to fasten it closed.Would not recommend it for a small dog."
2,Sent it back,I purchased this to fit inside a playpen for my dog but it really didn't fit so I ended up sending it back. It seemed like it would work well but I don't think it's a necessity.
2,cheaply made,"i ordered the large floor protection tray for my dog , in my opinion it is not worth the money ."
5,dog tray,Excellent my dog would always tear up trays and this has helped tremendously. The tray lays on the floor neatly.
4,Saved our floors!,Perfect size for our Pug and the back hallway. Pad stays in place even when Pug tries to scratch at it. Great value for price.
5,My Chihuahua love it!,"My three little furry kids love using the tray. You may also fold one side up for male dog (what a great idea!). When I am out for a long day which I cannot be home to take my boy out, he will then use the tray with fold side up. For wee wee pads, I use ""Prevail Fluff Underpad"" which is the best and most cheapest pads I can find on line, and size fits well with this tray."
5,Good,"Received on time in box with bubble wrap for protection, works well to keep puppy pads in place for easy clean up perfect for puppys or small dogs with potty training"
1,tray for puppy pads,"my puppy is traiined to the pads, i just wanted to protect my carpets better she would no longer even use them but ripped them to shreds i bought 3 of them a total waste of money i took the trays away and she went right back to using the pads"
4,Dog refuses to use it,"This product is the perfect size, very well made, and keeps the training pad in place. Our 6 year old Yorkie will NOT use it. He will pee to the side of it, but refuses to even stand on the tray. I am at my wits end and do not know what to do. He has ruined the glazed finish on our tile floor and I thought this would be the ticket to prevent any more damage. Wrong...it is not the fault of the product, but the spiteful nature of the dog."
3,Sounded Like a Good Idea,"I just adopted a young dog and thought that this training pad holder would be a good idea. I figured the pad wouldn't slide around and would look better on the floor. The description says that this would help protect your floor. Yes, the pad didn't slide around, it did look more ""finished"" on my floor and my floor didn't get wet - because my dog wouldn't use it. She was used to a pad on the floor and that was the only place she would go. Although I did try out a pad in it for a few days, it was left untouched. And maybe that was good because it was a bit of a pain to take the pad out of the holder. This will be sold at my next garage sale."
5,Iris Protection Tray,I have a long hair Chihuahua; she is a rescue dog & learning about everything as she had been kept in a crate by a hoarder. She didn't know what to make of the tray at first but is now using it to pee. As a last resort she will poop on it. I am very pleased with the product because she will use it to potty first thing in the am. & last thing at night. I live in the Pacific NW so this is a great help. I ordered two more trays yesterday for other areas of the house. The top rim clips to the bottom & holds the pad on the tray. I haven't had any problems at all. The product does what it claims to do & is very easy to clean.
5,Excellent for Medium/Large Breed Dogs,"This is an excellent pad holder I have had it for 2 months now and my english bulldog uses it without any problems. The larger pads are a bit more expensive especially if you buy them in the pet stores but on Amazon there is a seller that has the pads the fit the holder 150pads for $35. It even works if you use two smaller pads and they're slightly overlapping (which is almost more useful because you might be able to spare a pad). I highly recommend this pad holder if you have a larger breed dog, my English bulldog is now completely house broken."
4,Not perfect but worth the money,"My miniature dachshund puppy started chewing up her training pads and flipping them over to the wrong side. The protection tray does help keep it right side up. She can still scratch at the pads and rip holes in them, but the damage is much less than before and she's started using them much more now that they are flat. If you have a yard and a hose, it's easy to take the tray outside and spray it off for a quick cleaning. My only disappointment with this product was that the latches on the sides are somewhat difficult to latch. I usually have to stand it on it's side and press down hard to make sure it latches over the training pad, to hold the pad in, otherwise it can easily be pulled out by my puppy."
3,It works... but my dog hates it!,My dog is afraid to / disinterested in stepping up to go potty on this protection pad. I didn't read any reviews saying this was a problem so I wanted to at least make people aware of its potential. She is still a really young puppy so I'm hoping she gets over it soon!
3,No Pads to Fit IT,"I bought this to train my small dog with. There are NO pads in the small size to be found. 9""x13"" Size."
3,Not necessary with pads,"We bought this thinking it was a necessity with the pads. However, we have pads in three differnt places in the hours and don't use this any more. It's ok and works as designed, just not practical. The pads we bought are larger than the tray, so it didn't help. In addition, the pads do a great job obsorbing liquid that the floor under it is dry. As such, no additional protection is needed. I wish I could return it, but we did use it a couple times."
2,No complaints,"I don't have any complaint about this item. It does what it is suppose to do and holds the pads in place so the puppies can't tear up quite as easily which they do when they start getting close to the age where they can be adopted (about 6 weeks & above). However, I did see the same thing at Walmart for a bout $1 less than I paid at Amazon, so it's probably not one of my better purchases. Win some, lose some!"
3,Ok,I used this for my puppy in training with newspaper instead of puppy pads. Well my pup didn't necessarily make it on the tray all the time. And it was kind of messy to clean up.
2,I wish I had known,Being new at this whole puppy adventure I ordered this item - I didn't realize that you need to order specific size pads that are a little expensive. The tray itself is well made and I hope this works out.
3,My pup wouldn't respond to this!,"I bought this last year when we had adopted out 4 mo. Lab who was not house broken. I bought the potty pad and the spray to help ease house training, and she did not respond or attempt to use this even once. The only time she ever gave it any notice, she just laid on it as though it were her bed. Too bad -- my husband ended up pulling the 'I told you so' card on me."
3,Dog won't use :l,"I actually have heard good things about this from other people, so I got this for my daughter. Her dog refused to use it :("
1,Medium size might work better for small dogs,I bought this product for my two chihuahuas and for the most part worked OK but when they peed too close to the side edges the pee went all over the floor through the side openings. I think the medium size would probably be a better option since the bar that keeps the diaper down is all one piece.
2,Not What I expected,I made the mistake of not checking the dimensions and thought this item would cover the floor of the cage that it is listed as an accessory. The item description is more accurate now. It is the size of a lid that fits on a plastic bin and has clips. Save your money and use the lid off of one of your old storage bins. You can use a little tape to secure the corners of the pad or for that matter if the pad slides so what the puppy will still be using the tray not your floor.
1,Only for the Well-behaved,"3 month old puppy that knows to use pee pads, but can get anxious if left alone and would rip them up. The tray works great in mitigating ""fringe pee"", and stops the pad from sliding all over the floor..My puppy is a chewer, so the soft plastic on this product it all mangled. The clasps don't even close anymore, and the pup can rip the pee pads out from the sides, or even straight from the center if I tuck the sides in.This product was a waste of money, so I would suggest looking elsewhere. If you have a well-behaved dog, this is a great product, but otherwise, for a pup in training, this is no good and only invites headache."
2,So So,"It serves the purpose I guess - but the seal is not tight the dog getting on the thing will pop it loose. And it is to small, about 2 inches around smaller than the pee pads themselves."
1,not for dogs over nine pounds,"This item is probably best for dogs five pounds and under. it reduces the area of the wee wee pad with the frame, plus leaves some excess sticking out of the edge (depending on size of your wee wee pad). My dog urinated off of the side of the frame, making this more of a mess to clean than a wee wee pad alone."
5,Old Dog New Trick,"You sure can teach an old dog a new trick! My dog, Greta, who is old, half blind and slow moving immediately took to this pad holder. No more messes on the floor because the pads would leak. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has a dog that stays home alone while you are away at work. It is well made and stays in place on the floor. Other pad holders I looked at were very cheap in materials and flimsy. This one has snap closures on the sides to keep the pad flat and from moving around when the dog steps on it. Buy it, it is well worth the money."
2,Dog tears the pad with tray,"I purchased this tray primarily to prevent my dog from tearing apart the pads. If you're purchasing it for the same reason, save $25.00 and don't buy it because they'll tear the pad in the middle.If you're purchasing it solely to protect the floors, it may work for you."
1,Floor Protection Tray and training pads,The floor protection tray is big enough and weighted enough and really would work if the pads for it were not made too small.The pads need to be longer and the frame made with some type of catch so a puppy (or older) can't just pull the padout of the tray. Just a waste of money on the tray because the pads made for the product are too short and don't work any betterthan the cheaper brands available everywhere without having to order online. Very disappointed.
1,Training Pad Holder,This small floor tray was not compatible with my small training pads. It made a mess all over my floor. I am not a fan. I should have gotten the larger one. I used it for a week and then gave up.
2,Pads are still being shred,"After about a week, my 11-wk old English springer spaniel figured out how to tear the pads"
3,not needed,I had a different size cage and I couldn't get this to fit any of them My puppy has been greatg and I wouldn't have needed it I think pads would be okay by themselves
3,MY DOG WON'T USE IT,"I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE OF THE REVIEWS I READ & PEOPLE THAT I KNOW SAID IT'S A GOOD THING TO USE FOR A NEW PUPPY. I HAVE AN 8 MOS OLD YORKIE & SHE WON'T USE IT TO PEE ON. I EVEN BOUGHT THE SPRAY THAT WAS RECOMMENDED TO BE USED WITH IT, BUT NOPE SHE STILL WON'T PEE ON IT. SHE ONLY CHEWS ON THE SIDES OR SHE SITS ON IT WHILE EATING HER TREATS. IT MAY WORK FOR SOME DOGS, BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOT FOR MY YORKIE. IT WAS WORTH TRYING IT THOUGH, SO I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT OWNERS OF NEW PUPPIES BUY IT & GIVE YOUR DOG A CHANCE TO USE IT."
5,Great For My Little Yorkie!,"I purchased this tray for my little ""Puppy Mill"" rescue. She is a 7 year old yorkie and has never had to go potty anywhere but her cage. I love the design of this tray, it holds the disposable pads very well. It is easy to clean (she misses the center sometimes). I ordered another one today to put in the bedroom at night. I would definately recommend this to anyone with a small dog that doesn't plan on running outside 20 times a day for a teaspoon of tinkle!"
3,Puppy Won't Get On It...,"I bought the item because of the great reviews on Amazon.com. However, my puppy is 6months old and used to only the weewee pads on the flat surface. The fact that this item is raise a little off the floor the puppy looks at it like it's an alien. He won't get on it to pee or poop. He actually tore up the weewee pad when I placed it on the tray. Too bad - I was hoping I could protect my wood floors."
2,Not durable,"At first i thought it was great bc it kept everything in and did not leak but after two days my 8 week old dachshund had figured out how to unlock the sides (they are not locked in tight at all) and tore the pad up. Needs to be stronger, would not recommend."
3,Nothing wrong...just not useful in general.,"If you have a newborn puppy to care for...maybe you could use this. But truthfully, skip this unit all together and just lay your newspaper down on the floor. Others including my breeder didn't think these were useful and just a waste of money...and they're right. It's not a bad product at all, and if your dog chews the potty pad edges, this will deter them. But if your dog tears pads and eats them, don't use plastic pads, and switch to paper towels instead. Try that first before spending more money on wasteful dog products. I have a box of useless items, and unfortunately, this is one of them.But nothing wrong with the construction or concept!"
4,"Works, but not for the purpose I bought it for","I bought this with the intention of keeping my little italian greyhound from chewing up her puppy pads. It definitely keeps the pad in place and keeps messes from happening on the floor, but unfortunately once the pad is dry, it becomes a toy for my puppy. It is her mission to tear these pads apart no matter how much I try to drag her attention elsewhere.It definitely works for what it was intended, but unfortunately I may need to start looking for something else."
2,Not overly impressed,It doesn't fit standard sized potty pads. I found it better not to use. I have a min pin who is about 10lbs. This might be okay for a dog about 6 to 7 lbs max.
4,Good item at good price!!!!!,"Excellent price compare with the department and pet stores. I saw the same item at pet store for $19.95, I save money with this purchase!!!"
4,Puppy Pad Holder,The protection tray came quickly and is very sturdy. Was able to use it write away. Works well with training our new puppy.
2,Great at first :(,"pretty excited when i got this a few months back my dog male used it, the right way for a few days but after that he started to just pee on the edge of it..i think for male dogs they need something higher..i'm going to try using a dog litter box.."
2,"Good Info on Location of Hikes, but Poor Descriptions","This book does a nice job of identifying the location of various hikes in the Lake Tahoe area. That is primarily what I was looking for when I bought the book. However, the descriptions of the hikes, including waypoints, is poor. Some descriptions are just lacking in detail, while others have far too much detail, but it's not really about the hike itself. And the book gives an overall change in elevation for each of the hikes, but no description of the up-and-down that occurs on some of the hikes, which is more important -- especially when hiking at 6000+ feet."
3,Not what I was hoping for.,"I'm a fan of Johnny Cash and the Reverend Horton Heat.I don't listen to very much country made in my own lifetime (born in 77).The covers of his songs were way to modern country sounding for my taste. The Reverend did a good job obviously, I had already heard his cover of Folsom Prison and wanted to get his version of Get Rhythm since I liked the original so well. Unfortunately the rest sounded like the modern country I avoid."
3,I like Johnny better,"It's a good effort, but I'd rather listen to Johnny Cash. The arrangements for this CD are very similar to the originals, but the vocals have less feeling."
3,Great Questions/Review,This book was a great questions and review book before our regular veterinary school tests and to practice for the boards. My classmates and I regularly use these books to quiz ourselves before tests and some teachers use questions quite similiar. Awesome book!
1,swat car alarm,PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS......THE BATTERIES WEAR OUT FAST AND IT ITS CHEAP........YOU CAN GET A REGULAR FAKE ALARM WITH A FLASH LIGHT THATS JUST AS GOOD.....I BOUGHT 2 FOR $70 AND THEY ARE WORTHLESS
1,This product nearly ruined my life,"I got tinnitus, permanent ringing in the ears, after accidentally setting off the alarm while trying to disengage it. I nearly committed suicide as a result. Keep all car alarm sirens under the hood."
1,Problem getting a second or replacement remote control.,"The information sheet that comes with the alarm states ""IF YOU NEED ADDITIONAL REMOTES See Your Retailer"". I have misplaced my remote control, and after repeated searches on the internet, I have not been able to find anything about replacement remotes for this unit. The instructions do not give any contact information about whoever makes the S.W.A.T.-R alarms."
4,When Giants Roamed: The Golden Age of Steam (The History Channel),I very much enjoy information on railroads and I like to refer to this over and over.
5,golden age steam,My hobbie is model railroading and this gave me history and scenery to help build my model more accurately. I love the history of the railroad.
4,Steam Lives,Excellent coverage of some of steam age. Even those who haven't experienced steam first hand will really go for this one.
5,Train DVD,"For the history and railroad/train fan. I bought this as a gift for my dad who is into trains big-time. He is hard to please, and liked this."
1,You'll Be Tromatised By The Picture Quality,"For those hoping to play this disc on their HD-TV, forget it.The picture quality is bloody awful even if you try to boost it, it looks even worse.A shame too really as I wanted to add this to my trailer collection but now sadly will be adding it to the nearest rubbish bin.Don't they check picture quality on DVD's anymore?"
2,What a poor selection,"This selection as so many compilations are just not worth the money. But let's start first with the good: the CD 1 contains pretty much all of the greatest hits. CD 2 contains few more hits plus many remixes (from the CD ""20th Century Hits"" which badly flopped) which clearly can't stand the comparison with the originals. Further there are as well some B-sides (New York City & Strange) which are for the first time released on CD/album. The record company knew why! The hammer is the title ""Papa Chico"" - one of the worst if not the worst single release of Boney M. ever.. which flopped, no wonder, terribly. So I ask myself: WHY THIS? Why not a putting a compilation together with the big hits and some of the finest tracks that Boney M did like ""Never Change Lovers.."" ""Boonoonoonoos, or ""Still I'm Sad"". That would have been a great showcase for this legendary group and its fantastic and diverse music. So this is only for fans who want some stuff on CD. What a missed chance."
5,25 Jaar THE BEST DISCO MUSIC IN TOWN,"Absolutely the best compilation ever, these two guys of the Liz Mitchell Fanclub (The Leadsinger Of Boney M. !!!) did a great job together with BMG Holland and Frank Farian the producer and male vocalist ! These CD is worth the buy, with exclusive remixes and unreleased tracks.Great, when is the release of Volume 2 ?"
4,Algebra for advanced beginners,I used this book as a supplement to a course in algebra at master level. Allenby uses a simple step by step approach to the subject supplied with simple examples and some exercises (not that simple).What I realy like with this book is the historical tour of algebra and the brief presentation of many of the worlds famoust mathematicians.I think the simple approach and the historical elements is main reason for still using this book when I am plying with the math.
1,R-Type: The Sound Effects CD,What a rip-off and major disappointment. After the too cool for words music of the Original R-Type and the jazzy remixes on the (increasingly impossible to find) R-Type Special CD. I was very much let down to discover just how abysmal this 'soundtrack' CD is. There is no music on it. Trust me. It's all just sound effects and boring noises. This is NOT music. And definitely NOT something you should consider buying. This CD is truly a stain on the wonderful history of a cool franchise. Hunt down one of the earlier CDs instead of forking over your dough for this. Even the alarmingly average R-Type Delta score is wonderful stuff in comparison.
4,Hysterically funny book - great for showers!,"Women will especially love this complilation of cartoons poking fun at the ""bastard"" that they may know. Great gift idea for showers, etc. A training manual for the bride."
3,Too expensive,This product is really expensive it smells great and all but I don't see much of a miracle difference I bought the day cream as well and you have to put a really small amount or your face will be very greasy :/
2,Oy Vey,"First, unless you understand Yiddishisms, get yourself a copy of Joys of Yiddish because you're need it. Second, get yourself something very, very strong to drink (Manischievitz won't do the trick) because you're going to need it if you really want to get through this. Third, get a different book instead because, while this book is somewhat original in concept, it falls flat in just about every over category."
5,Underwater Adventures continue......,"Like its predecessors, this Freddi Fish adventure continues to stimulate young minds to remember items and clues for later use in the game. My 3 year-old loves to play the game over and over and I love the fact that the clues needed to solve the game change each time. Graphics and sound are great!"
5,Excellent!,"We ordered Freddi Fish 2, 3, 4, and 5. All are just wonderful! My three year old daughter loves them. They have staying power, meaning they do not get old very quick like a lot of the other children's games. They have excellent learning value. I would highly recommend any and all of them for someone from the 3-5 age group."
4,Freddi Fish is definitely a good buy,"My five-year-old has played it several times and loves it. I find it helps to make a map and note what mission it gives you at that spot. That way, when you find the object, you know where to take it to get credit or the next item you need. There are two versions, with slightly different missions, of the game; this way, you can enjoy playing it twice."
3,"Great game, but a little too haunting for one of my childrn","My three year old loves this game, but my six year old is totally spooked by the ghost which has given her nightmares. The rest of the Freddie Fish games are not scary and all keep my kids totally absorbed for hours thinking and having fun."
5,Freddie Fish sets the standard,"This was my four-year-old's first Freddie program and we ended up getting three others too. This is currently one of her favorites along with Clifford, Putt-Putt, Blues Clues, Ollo, and Nemo. The game is fairly even in difficulty throughout with one exception--to get the trident she must unscramble a sliding puzzle with which she sometimes needs my help. I have sifted through a lot of chaff to find the ""wheat"" among four-year-old software programs. This is one of the good ones. The graphics are compelling, the music is snappy, the problem solving is adequate, and most importantly my girl chooses to play it."
1,Threw it away,"I threw this game away because of the ghost. I did not like my 3-year old son being scared of the ghost; and then talking about ghosts for days. My husband was a little sad that I threw it away because he said it was an okay game. I was tired of my son asking to play with it; and then dealing with the ghost episode. I do highly recommend ""Putt-Putt Enters the Race"" instead. My son never tires of playing it and it is a lot of fun for him. The actual race is not as much fun as the game itself."
3,knife,This knife has worked extremely well. The store owner was helpful and honest in his assessment of tool. The price was very fair. It was used but is definitely durable and sturdy.
3,Where's it made,"Although the Kershaw web site says it's made in USA, the blade is marked ""China"". Not particularly sharp either. Maybe that explains the cheaper price."
5,Columbia Years: 1943 - 1952,"This 1993 12 cd box set contains all of Frank's studio recordings with Columbia, and comes with a hard cover book. The recordings were taken from the vinyl stamping plates and digitally remastered so that it sounds as clean as magnetic tape. I've heard people say that Frank sounded too young in the early years, but I think by about 1946 he sounded as good as he did with Capital. And even the early stuff sounds great by any other performer's standard. Each cd averages about 73 minutes. It's also sometimes said that Frank's early stuff was geared at the teen market and was too schmaltzy, but I think that may have been true of some of his Dorsey material, but not this. In fact Frank re-recorded many of the Columbia songs with differant arrangements with Capital and even Reprise. Great stuff."
2,Flashcard style book,"This book basically gives a short, flashcard style summary before it goes into a handful of questions on what you just read. Not a very good book on helping you grasp A & P. I would say that this book would only come in handy as a quick review after having studied something like A & P, by E. Marieb. A & P the easy way, from Barron's easy way series is a more useful study guide."
2,confusing at best,"I bought this book as a very basic overview of a&p; for the pharmacy entrance exam. I didn't need anything indepth. Even with my low standards, I was still disappointed. The book is simplified down to the point where its not even correct anymore. For instance, on page 83, discussing transcription it says: ""RNA leaves the nucleolus and picks up the chemical coded message from the DNA. The process of ""picking up"" the coded message is called transcription. RNA then leaves the nucleus with the coded message and travels to the ribosomes"".The way transcription actually works is that a copy of RNA (premessenger RNA) is made from a strand of DNA and modified into messenger RNA, and then sent out of the nucleus to ribosomes. RNA doesn't go to DNA for anything after its made, RNA is copied from a strand of DNA.I only read one page, and that page was incorrect. That's pretty bad. Luckily Barnes and Noble has a good return policy."
3,A/P Cliff Notes on Kindle,I found this book hard to read on the kindle. I couldnt ajust the page size. I have a hard copy of another Cliffs Notes that I used alot. But I give up after a few minutes on this one. It was not worth the money or my time.
4,Anatomy and Physiology,This is the perfect book to help with my college class. It's easy to read and use!
5,Sensible methods in Water Color Painting,"Al Stine, an illustrator turned fine artist, demonstrates techniques in using water color. He has a way of explaining his methods in an understandable and concise way. The style of painting is very traditional and realistic."
4,return to belle amber vintage romance set in Australia,"Belle Amber had always been part of Karen's life, and now she was living there again it was dearer to her than anything or anyone else--except Guy.

5,another Miller classic,Millers heroins traits of strong wills and high pride do not lack in this exciting adventure/romance novel surely to capture your heart.
4,Interesting document,"This is a very interesting performance of Mahler's 3rd. Maestro Mitropoulos always had something remarkableto say in his readings and this is no exception. However, despite some great and awesome playing, the score isperversely cut that could be unacceptable for some. I would rather recommend Mitropoulos last recording withthe Kölner RSO (his last recorded concert), that is much better judged, excellently played and with no cuts."
2,Difficult to see notation at normal viewing distance on music holder,"The notation is way too small for comfortable sight-reading. I have tried a couple of times, but have set this book aside in favor of my Warner fake books which have a very comfortable viewing size."
3,Problems in concert,"Some of the page numbers are out of order in this book so if you are using it in performance and need to find something quickly, you may be out of luck!"
2,Content of book,"Has many favorite Berlin songs arranged for guitar; but a disappointment for piano players: only has melody line, not arranged in four part harmonies."
3,missing pages,"Without actually commenting on the literary content, there's a problem with the manufacturing of the copy I received. Pages 279-310 have been replaced with duplicates of pages 247 to 278. Page 311 is within the bibliography, so I do not have any of the narrative after page 278. Has anyone else received a copy like this? It's a bit disappointing to be missing the last chapter of a book after already having read most of it...."
1,Sympathy for the Devil,"Burke Davis has proven a point with his silly little ""well researched"" piece of Yankee apologia. The point he makes is that even people born and reared in the south can be indoctrinated into the cult of Lincoln.Davis paints a romantic picture of a vicious war criminal who should have been hanged for his war on civilians. Writers like Davis abound in the area of ""Civil War"" writing. It's too bad that their garbage is all that is available from most chain bookstores.The other reviews on this site of this little farcical pamphlet could all have been written by the same mindless slug. I'm ashamed to have wasted my money on Davis' little piece of propaganda and would have given it a lower rating than one star had there been a choice.This little work deserves all the obscurity it can get."
2,extang tonnneau cover,"I purchased one in July 06, the stiching was bad, they sent another one. Now the roof supports will not stay inplace, I contacted there customer service, last week, still waiting for reply. I will not buy this brand again."
3,Extang Tonno Cover in Winter,"I like the looks of this cover. Very trim and smooth. Whatever you do though, don't take it off when it's below around 65 degrees F. You will never get it back on. If you live anywhere in the North and you don't have a heated garage, don't plan on using your truck's bed to haul anything in the winter."
1,Don't waste your time or money.....,"Summary: Poorly designed and plain doesn't work. The only design goal appears to be seperating people from their money.This has to be one of the worst products I've ever seen. It's made of very cheap lightweight plastic. The front brushes are spun by pushing action turning some tiny wheels in the center of the brushes. The whole thing doesn't weigh more than a couple of pounds. Junk, junk, junk."
1,Dont buy it,"As soon as I opened the box I knew I wasted my money. Listen to the other reviews, not worth a dime!!!!!"
1,never received!,"I never received the item. They thought they sent the correct item once, I called them so they re-sent the same item. Not the one we ordered!"
3,Not What They Should Be,"After 3 hours of normal sledding with both adults and kids 11 and under, the Flexible Flyer Snow Screamers took a surprising amount of damage. The bottom plastic panel started to pull apart from the foam body around the edges and one of my two sleds even had a long gash through the bottom in to the foam. Also the decorated top plastic layer started to peel away around the edges. That said, I like how these sleds feel to ride and steer, but it seems they need to be better built for the price."
2,Not durable,"We bought the sled for my daughter. Loved the ride and it controlled well, but after only 40 minutes of normal use the plastic bottom started peeling from the foam upper. We had to return it."
3,They've not yet gotten it right,"This thing really sails down the hill and gives you a good ride on packed snow. Three or four times. Then the bottom begins to curl and peel off and you start to think 'good lord, I paid $30 bucks for this!' But your kids keep playing with it, even though it's junk and falling apart.They need to find a new glue to hold the bottom on, then this thing will be worth $30 bucks. Until then, it's a rip off."
2,Poor Quality on an Expensive Fan,"Considering the fan is from Vornado, I had expected it to be well designed and manufactured. The fan is almost entirely made of plastic. This itself isn't a major problem. But the plastic components aren't assembled tightly, which causes the fan to wobble and produce an annoying sound when operating at any speed. This makes for an unpleasant experience when the fan is sitting within a couple feet of me. I'm reluctant to use the fan because of the irritating noise it generates.I've had good experiences with the more expensive Vornado whole-room air circulators. But, in this case, Vornado clearly put their reputation on the line to save a few dollars with a poorly designed & manufactured product."
4,just run-of-the-mill EXCELLENT!,I've had this fan a little over two years and since then it's been running year round for me. In the summer it helps cool the air and circulate the central A/C more efficiently. In the winter months it circulates the heat for me as well. I've tried other fans and this one lives up to the claims in its description that it moves air both faster and further than fans its size and even those much larger.On low it makes just enough white noise to be appreciated as a sleep aid. On high it's a little too noisy for my tastes. It moves air so well though that I never really need it on high unless I've burned something in the kitchen and need to exchange the air rapidly.I have pets in the home and I like that the grill is tightly designed so no little paws can get hurt here.One star deducted for noisy in high cool mode but otherwise very pleased with this product and highly recommended.
1,Extremely Noisy,The noise level is so annoying I can't keep it on long enough to determine how much air it circulates.
2,Could be better built,Have had this Vornado for 3 months and the knob broke out of the blue just with normal use. The fan itself works fine and is quiet but disappointed something as simple as a knob couldn't be better made to last longer than a few months. Not very useful without the knob!
3,Vornado Fan,"I recently bought a Vornado Fan after my son told me he had a couple. It did not come with the pads to stick under the feet so I have to put it on a piece of carpeting. The first few days it was quite fine, but now it has a rattle in it that I cannot seem to get to stop. I am very disappointed as I am sensitive to noise and my son told me that they were very quiet and it was until today."
1,PoS,Purchased on 24 APR 12 for deployment. Died on 28 JUN with less than 50 hours of use. Seems to be a reocurring theme with this product.
5,CIRCULATES AIR IN ENTIRE ROOM,Vornado 530B 3-Speed Compact Air Circulatormakes my kitchen comfortable when I'm bakingin the summertime. It stirs the air when notdirected toward you for a comfortable airmovement.
3,Not what they used to be.,"The quality on this Vornado product is not as good as in the past. The product is no longer made in the USA but is instead made in China. Whether or not this is the reason for lower quality I don't know. Like a couple of other reviewers this unit is not not near silent on low speed and unless aimed directly upright has an irritating rhythmic ""burmpt, burmpt"" to it. On higher speeds this noise goes away but the air noise increases significantly as reported by others. $40 is a high price for a less than perfectly executed small ""air circulator."""
2,Good while it lasted....Warranty is worthless,"This fan seemed great at first--it was quiet and powerful. After about 2 weeks of use, it started making a rattling sound on the higher speeds. After 2 years of occasional use, it stopped working altogether yesterday. Even though it is technically under warranty still, the warranty is not worth anything. To get it repaired, you have to not only pay to ship it back to Vornado, but they make you include a check for $20 for return shipping & handling. Plus, they say it will take 3-5 weeks to repair. Considering we got the fan for $31, it is not at all worth it to act on the warranty. Maybe ours was just defective..."
1,Disappointed,"Bought my first Vornado years ago, and is the best fan I've ever seen. Decided to get a second one... purchased this model. First unit had bad vibration, returned it. Second unit less vibration, but very noisy. Also returned. When I compare this unit to my original Vornado, the quality of construction is noticeably much inferior. I don't know if this applies to the rest of the Vornado lineup or not."
4,"Powerful, for its size.","In a 12x15 room, it does a pretty good job of keeping me cool. Vornado seems to be the best bang for the buck when it comes to small fans. Don't expect magic, but it is better than the overpricedDyson Air Multiplier Table Fan."
2,Noisy,"Despite Vornado's claims of ""whisper quiet"" this fan is quite loud at any speed, but in different ways. At the lowest speed, there is a clicking from the fan blades or motor shaft. At high speeds, there is so much turbulence from the 'exclusive' air-shaping design that the vortex noise is amazingly high. This can be mitigated by removing the grille, but... let's be serious. Returned to Amazon."
3,Great Fan For A Year !,"I use fans year round for air circulation in My NYC apartmentand office. I purchase at least 1 (or 2) of these fans a year.Sooner or later, you eithera) Shut them off (and they never start up again) ....b) Just die a natural death. Yes, they are great and powerfulwhile they last. But like all fans and like others have mentioned,Vornados Warranty is useless.Buy it if you want a fan that's quiet and blows good air.Don't buy it if you want a fan that's going to last forever.I'm amazed at some of the fan reviews on here. How muchcan you say about an item that circulates air ? :)"
5,It does what it says,I replaced a giant fan in the bedRoom with this. It's solid and quick little fan with very strong wind
3,BRING BACK THE OLD VORNADO'S!,"I cant agree more with the other reviewers who were disappointed by these new models. I've owned around a dozen of these fans (people keep ""borrowing"" them!) + was especially fond of the ""variable"" speed model. You could get it EXACTLY the speed you wanted, not unlike a dimmer switch. Now my only choice is low, med, high. And to top it all off, i dont think ""high"" is as high as it used to be. having said all that, i still gave it 3 stars cause its still the best fan out there. But please-Vornado, i'm begging u, bring back the variable speed model in all your size fans!"
3,"Good, but not what I expected","I live in Brooklyn NY and my room is extremely hot. I do not have central air conditioning and I only have a skylight in my room. Of course the only kind of AC units that I can get in my apartment are window units and in my room, it simply cannot be done. This fan is said to ""circulate"" the room. It definitely does circulate it, but I honestly think its because its so strong. I think for the price, I wouldn't purchase this item again. Although it is one of the strongest fans I have ever felt, it doesn't actually achieve what I thought it would. Although, I have a very hot room, maybe its just not as noticeable. If I place the fan on top of my desk (about 5 feet off the ground) and lay in bed, I can kind of feel the air circulating. Instead I just use it blowing directly on me although I need to have it at least 6 feet away. Overall a good product and I do enjoy it, but I think you could find a fan that doesn't advertise the circulating part and get it cheaper."
1,"Vornado fan not ""whisper quiet.""","My fan is not whisper quiet. It is quite noisy. I bought it for my office (I'm a psychologist). It makes too much noise, I brought it home and am using it here."
5,Awesome!,Super fast shipping and very high quality fan. I own another large floor Vornado and love it. This small one is a perfect size to fit on our nightstand and is quiet to sleep with but very powerful. I recommend any Vornado product.
5,THIS SMALL VORNADO FAN WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!!,"I have used these Vornado fans for the past four or five years. This new fan was a replacement for an identical Vornado fan which I thought had stopped working. Well I had somehow I had cut the power to the fan, hence the reason it quite. So now I have a spare as the old Vornado is still working perfectly.Speaking of working, my little fan, will blow hard (about one-half the way across my two car garage). We recently had a yard sale and brother was it hot. So I plugged the, older of the two fans, into a wall plug in the garage. This Vornado fan kept a cooling breeze the whole day. So now as stated prior I have two of these identical fans and will not get rid of either one.I can highly recommend these Vornado fans. Just shop around to find the best price for one."
3,Good enough,"The price is right. It looks good. It moves the air as promised, but it is noisier than I expected on the medium and hight speed settings."
1,terrible game,"My 5 year old got it as a gift and popped it in. After endless listening to the slow talking fox (you could actually spend 20 minutes without more than two mouse clicks), we got nowhere. I don't have hours on end to sit with him while looking on-line for every stupid click sequence to get to the next step. After an hour we gave up and I was so ticked off I had to pen this review."
3,A good start,"""Creature Collection"" is a good place to start when introducing people to the Scarred Lands campaign setting. I very much liked the details and bits of history that were given in each entry. Unfortunately this book does suffer from two flaws. Many of the illustrations in the book were just plain bad; they were just poorly done. The other thing I did not like about this book was the fact that many of the creatures were ludicrous and not really useful outside of the campaign setting without a lot of changes. If you were going to be campaigning in the Scarred Lands, I would recommend getting this book; otherwise you can safely skip over this item without really missing anything."
4,Pretty wild creatures!,"I did enjoy the collection of monsters here. Some of them are a bit repetive and not so useful, others can be 'comic' releif and some of them are just silly and some need a tone down here and there. Overall it is decent enough for the price and you will be able to pull a monster or two out of the book here and there. Not sure what the forsaken stuff is about. The pics are black and white, which isn't bad. Black and white brings simplicity and it's own auroa. If you need some more material as for as monsters, this would be good but hardly mandatory. I think the fatling here is awesome!"
3,If you are buying it for the pictures beware,"As far as an informative book for the game this complies a 100% but if you, as me, like these books because of the drawings learn now that they are black and white and not very appealing to look at."
2,Torpedo Bra,The silhouette of this bra is extremely retro. It resembles that of a 1950's torpedo bra. The structure on the side also somehow squishes your flesh up into your armpit so that it ends up looking very unattractive. The fabric of the bra is great and supportive however the silhouette is not suitable for a younger woman.
2,Quite disappointed,"I bought this mostly for the Dave Clark 5 single 'Glad All Over'.... but that isn't what is on the CD. They included (and didn't list the artist) a version by Billy Fury - quite lackluster and flat compared to the DC5. Several of the cuts were over-recorded, with high distortion levels in places (like Wooly Bully). If the CD had been $9 I would not have expected any better. Evidently, the DC5 never licensed their work for collections such as this. Too bad - Glad All Over is one of the best high energy Brit songs of the 60's."
3,"""Milk Sweetened"" misleading title","Milk Sweetened Carob Chips are not sugar-free. Here are the listed ingredients: Sugar, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (palm kernel, coconut, palm), whey powder, carob, brown sugar, SOYA lecithin (an emulsifier) and vanillan (an artificial flavor). Contains: DAIRY & SOYIf you desire a package of sugar-sweetened carob chips, they will not disappoint in flavor."
1,I already sent a complaint - no response,"I am really disappointed in the customer service. I sent a complaint over a month ago because the chips arrived with the plastic broken open and carob chips scattered all over the box - totally inedible and usable. I haven't heard anything back. I wouldn't use this seller and unfortunately feel 100% ripped off. Dear seller, please contact me at timbre440@yahoo.com. This is my second request."
3,Carob chips are expensive!!!,"I bought these to use for making dog treats. While they are good as carob chips go, they are really expensive! I would not buy them again at this price!!!!"
2,June's On the cover but not in the group!!!,"WHY put an OLE Picture of the group (from the Motown Lp early 1990's) when June is NO Longer with the group??? This is a LIVE Cd/dvd from 2004. June has been long gone. Shame on the record company! ANd fans beware JUNE is NOT on the cd nor in the group, bonnie's daughter Issa took her place a good 2/3 years ago. Now, she is good..but if you wanted the POINTER SISTERS you get 2 sisters and a Neice~"
2,I was not impressed.,"Personally I didn't think the book was written well. Perhaps if the author would have taken more time she could have done better. Perhaps some people can get something out of it, but I was not impressed with it. There just wasn't any continuity to it. I give her credit for addressing a subject that deserves to be written about, but I would not waste my money on the book."
2,RENAME THIS BOOK!!!,"I am sorry, while I agree with the ideas the author puts forth, being both very open minded and calm when hearing other ideas, I just cant get over the fact that perhaps the author has confused PAGANISM with WICCA! Wicca is an established religion, albiet rather new in the borad scheme of things, but the beliefs and practices of wicca are not up for debate, or go-as-you-please. *PAGANISM* is however, as varied as the rainbow. To confuse Wicca and Paganism once is fine, but to write a whole book saying that Wicca is synonomous with paganism is just disrespectful.Im all for people saying they are Pagan Christians, the idea of a holy trinity works well into an earthbased religious system, even one using ceremonial magic. This could be a beautiful spiritual system.A ""Wiccan Christian,"" however, just can not exist. That is disrespectful of the accepted rules of *both* those religions.Please, dont confuse eclectic earth based god-and-goddess paganism with Wicca."
1,Not Gonna Work.,"Ok. Seriously. Like the other person said, you can't be a pagan Christian. And also, that is a JEWISH star in the background. Wiccan stars have only five points. It is obviously a Christian writing this book just trying to hide the fact that they are attempting to wean Wiccans into Christianity. I am not against Christianity, but can people just leave others alone and let them believe what they want to believe? Convert is the worst word in the English language."
1,Rename the book. Insulting!,"I won't buy the book. There has never been a thing called Christian Wicca, and there is no such thing as a Christian Witch. Wicca is for those bound to Earth-- the Druids, Pagans, Witches, Wiccans. It is our faith. We don't need Christianity in it. It's a slap in the face. Especially since many Christians believe us Wiccans worship a ""Satan"". Wrong again. That is a Christian built evilness. Leave your faith out of ours please. You may be magical in your own ways, but that doesn't make you Wiccan. I suggest reading books by Amber K or Silver Ravenwolf to educate yourself."
1,Christian Wicca,"This book SUX. Don't waste your money!!! The author obviously has no clue of religous structure. I am a practicing Christian Witch, and I have found no bases for this book."
2,It was alright,See I am a Witch and I was hoping in this book to find a dedication ritual and I really don't like this book because I feel I can incorparate the Christian God and Goddess in too 100% Wicca so I recomend Teen witch for the teen un less your advanced or an adult try To ride a silver broom stick and I want to continue to practice some of the wicca out of this book and my other one but it was alright.
3,Short Primer To Start Thinkin',"Is there any hope for democracies in ethnically divided lands? This is a question that the West needs to answer, because if there isn't, aide and security policies need to be readjusted to realities, or peace will never find a permanent home. The book's highest points are two extended essays on the title topics. However, other essays cover such diverse ethnic issues as Serbia's disintegration, Nigerian tribal problems, the Quebecois of Canada, and India. This is an excellent starting point for reflection, and for comparing the book's prediction of the future as it looked in 1994. The 'stable' world must address the issues of ethnicitiy and minorities. This book clearly makes the case for that. Perhaps other books help point the directions that we might should go."
5,Proud of what you have done!,"Cathy and I first knew each other online several years ago when we were both very ill with Interstitial Cystitis and all of the other syndromes that come with it. Then we lost touch and reconnected shortly after her book came out. After catching up we found that we had done many of the same things to recover from IC. I am very proud of Cathy for writing this book and telling of her struggles and triumph over this disease. I certainly did not have the discipline to write a book about what I went through. I cannot thank her enough for sharing what she learned with others so that they might beat this horrible disease as she and I have done. People need to know that there is hope. That conventional medicine or IC ""experts"" are not the only ones with answers. Great job Cathy!"
5,Excellant! Emotionally Charged!,Thank goodness someone has written a book about her own true to life experiences with IC!! I have had IC for 7 years and am so happy to know someone else like me not only has this desease but has written a lovely true account of what it is like to live with this debilitating desease. I highly recommend this book! P.S. The questionnaire/ survey (real results from real IC sufferers) in the back of the book is very very helpful too! Thank you for writing it!
5,exactly what i needed,"this book is so comforting for someone who has struggled with this horrible disease. she talks about the horrors she went through and i just kept nodding my head because i have been there. i feel like this book gave me permission to really embrace how i was feeling instead of telling myself that i was just too sensitive or ""being lazy"".this book is for anyone who has ic, but mostly for those of us who are at our wits end on what to do and need to hear that others do have as bad of cases as us. please don't feel like your alone, because this book proves that your not!!!"
2,"Informative, to much drama","This book was a quick read for me as I was on the improving side of six years of horrific IC and eager to learn anything new that I could. While there are definately some very good points and information I feel she dramatized all of her symptoms and pain much more than necessary to get the points across. All I can say is if she did have the experiences she discribes, her husband must be a complete saint and she should be thankful he is still around to support her.This book is an eyeopener!"
4,EXCELLENT! IT IS ABOUT TIME THERE IS A BOOK ON IC.,"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK, BECAUSE LIKE MANY PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM IC, I FELT ISOLATED. NOW I KNOW THERE ARE OTHERS LIKE ME, AND CAN HEAR ABOUT THE EXPERIENCES THEY HAVE HAD. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT EVERYTHING WORKS FOR ALL OF US, JUST SOME ALTERNATIVE IDEAS TO THINK ABOUT.DEDE"
4,The perspective of an IC patient who has been there!,"This book has been of great help to me and was so comforting to read and realize that someone who also had IC had gotten well. She knows exactly how we feel when we are in pain. I think one of the things that impressed me the most was her gentle approach to healing. I realize that Ms Simone is not a doctor but that was all the more reason why her book interested me. She was speaking as a patient, not a doctor. I think it is good for us to explore all kinds of methods of care, not just the medical field. As all of us know who has IC, every patient is different and different things work for different people. So, why not look at everything? I have used some of her techniques and they have helped me greatly. I think it would be well worth your while to read this book if you are in need of some help with your IC."
5,Excellent book!! Many helpful remarks and ideas.,"I was diagnosed with IC at the age of 40, but probably had IC since my first Caesarean at age 27. This is the first book I've read on IC that makes sense. Makes me understand how I got IC. I like author's helpful hints, and they work. I sent copies of this book to two urologists. Should be required reading for anyone with IC, and particularly ALL urologists world-wide. At last, a voice that understands our pain."
5,"Finally, a book written by someone that *really* understands","We grew up when Doctors were the only ones you listened to for medical advice...but the diseases have become more complicated and the Doctors have fewer answers. Thank you Cathy for taking your health by the horns and taking on this dreaded disease...and most of all for giving us hope by sharing your experiences in this wonderful book. If you know anyone with Interstitial Cystitis, this book is a *MUST*!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Beware having these shipped to you in the Summer,The product description doesn't mention it but simply having the product shipped to you on a hot day will ruin it. You should only order it when the expected 10 day forecast remains between 50 and 70 Farenheit. I ordered during the Summer and all the strips were activated and ruined. BP Medical sent replacements TWICE but during the Summer it's difficult to say how warm the product gets during shipping. The second shipment was also ruined due to it being too hot the second time it arrived and sat in our mailbox until someone got home. The third shipment seemed okay (none of the strips appeared to be activated) but I tried it several times and I could never get a reading abover 96 degrees Farenheit. In the end I pitched them in the garbage.
5,Great for purses and first aid kits!,"There is no glass to break and no mercury to leak! the numbers are easy to read if you pay attention to the column and row headings. This is a great product! Perfect to carry in a purse, put in a first aid kit or keep in your desk at work. Once it's used, just throw it away, no cleaning or worrying about who used it before you."
4,Safe Thermometer,I first saw these in a hospital clinic several years ago. They were being used for seizure patients. I thought about them when I was caring for a small child who was running a temperature. I searched on line and ordered a box to have available when needed. They seem to be accurate but they cool down very quickly. You need to check them immediately after removal.
1,Didn't work; returned it,"I purchased this item based on its low price and simplicity. Unfortunately, it just didn't work; it did not charge a single device. I ended up returning it... I think you can get better options elsewhere."
2,very cheap charger,"needs more info, still have not oppened because it is not clear if it will work with 30 g ipod, looks very cheap"
5,Outstanding customer service!,"This charger didn't work for my charging my iPod, however, the seller was prompt and sent me a new charger which I received within days. It worked perfect. For that reason alone, I would purchase from this seller again."
2,Get a brand name item instead,"Purchased to charge my ipod touch in my car. Charger plugs into cigarette lighter just fine and the little light indicates it is receiving power. I plug my ipod usb cable into it, plug the other end into my ipod, and nothing. The battery icon on the top right shows no change. The ipod doesn't charge. Disappointed as it was advertised for use with ipods. I ended up buying a Belkin one for a few dollars more and it worked, no problems."
1,Does not charge iPod,"This product does not charge my iPod touch, just keeps the battery at the same level. I do not recommend this product."
1,does not work,"Upon plugging this in, it will turn off/on continually, causing my phone to vibrate constantly. DOES NOT WORK!!!So cheap not even worth returning."
2,Confusing - Nonsense,"We've played other Putt-Putt games, but for some reason, Travels Through Time is not only confusing to my 5-yr old child, but he has no interest in it. This is the kid who plays Freddi Fish over and over and over, same with Pajama Sam. Maybe it's for an older child, but I'd still not recommend it. I think the whole game is nonsense."
5,3 year old LOVES Putt Putt,"I came on to Amazon to see if there were other titles in the Putt Putt series since my son loves this game so much. I would not have guess that he would get the game as well as he has. He is able to navigate the entire game and solve the problems which can be quite complex (in one senerio Putt Putt can't get past some thorny vines in the Dinosaur world - Max figured out that he needed the armor from the Castle world which he had to buy with a nickel picked up from Western World). Putt Putt helps you along and everything is explained very well.The best part of the game is that it changes every time it is played.Every child has different learning levels, especially at this age (3-5) so it may not work out for your child as it does mine."
3,Putt-Putt Travels Through Time,"I'm StoryMaker and I am reviewing Putt-Putt TTT! First, we made Action Peps, many pep-like dogs (Pep is also one, but we ussaly call him Regular Pep) and there are Mean Action Putt-Putts (Regular Putt-Putt is good though). This game used to be complex (like other reviews mention) but now we've learned all the answers and it's a bit boring, but there are fun games in most places! I'm not saying them cuz my last review had a [...] bug. And in the castle times you need to put the wheel back on Woodword but you must click the wheel once to do it! Some kids would think you needed to use a tool. It's confusing. But this is a good game, maybe not good for under 6 according to other reviews. Signed, StoryMaker. ""Gotta trust the kid's review!"" PS: Putt-Putt Circus isn't as fun. It dosen't change."
2,Returned It.,"My family and I were really excited about ordering these ornaments. We ordered about 5, and we decided that we'd make it a yearly tradition to order an ornament every Christmas. Unfortunately, when the ornaments arrived, we were shocked by the actual size of them. They are all VERY, VERY SMALL!While they are lovely looking, they are just too tiny. And considering the cost of each ornament, I can't say that it's worth it. Not to mention that you'd have to spend a small fortune to fill a small tree with these. They are gorgeous, though. Oh well."
4,Interesting,He was in the middle of a lot of the Auto industry in it's most trying times. His viewpoint seems well founded and should be suggested reading of serious stsudents of business practices both good and bad.Mr. Lutz names names and give examples of his points.Most refreshing was his run down of the points of personal behavior needed in business.I was a participant in the Auto industry a bit earlier and thru the 1980's and found the book very clear on many of the things I observed.
4,Amazing!,"Excelent point of view, ideas well placed, open minded, shows the ability to handle complex business with not being guided by the book of the commons. That's how leaders succeed."
4,DVD Review Fingerstyle Guitar,You will have to get past the quality of the video to really appreciate what a great tool and companion this is to Mr. Pearlman's book. I found the video to be a perfect compliment to the book and extremely helpful.
5,"First Not Soo Great, But Than Blown Away","Okay, im not generally a taul paul fan, but the mixes on this cd are fantastic. Judge Jules CD is pretty good, the average expected from him, however tall paul is awesome all the mixes come across extreemely clean and flow together well. THis is a cd i can just pop in and listen to all the way through without getting tired of it."
4,Good Item,Haven't dulled them yet so I don't know how long they'll stay sharp but they seem to be of good quality.
4,Does the job,"I got these to replace ALL the speakers in a pair Peavey CL-2's; 12 in all. I was drawn to the WH68 because of its specs and that it had cloth surrounds making them perfect for PA use and its price because I needed so many. I was pretty surprised that they had larger magnets, a larger bump out on back, and a vented pole when compared to the originals. My only complaint and reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that I believe the 96db (1w1m assumed) sensitivity seems extremely optimistic. I'd practically guess it to be in the 80's somewhere. They are 6.5"" as the previous commenter reported, but fit my enclosures. For it's price and construction it's a good deal, but don't expect it to live up to all the mfr's hype."
3,Wrong specs!!,"Very disappointed with the specs of these speaker they are not 6"" speakers but 6.5"" couldn't use them in my project.Be aware ot it!! George Santel"
3,Stock Sub replacement for Ford Explorer,"This speaker fits very snugly in a 1994 ford explorer limited JBL stock sub case. Mine was blown out when I bought the truck, I replaced it with this speaker, and with the factory amp it sounds kinda quiet and it has trouble hitting lower frequencies. i mean, its probably the crappy factory amp, but i never heard this particular stereo with the stock speaker so I really have nothing to compare it to.Other than that, shipped and received very fast with all of the correct parts appears to be great quality for the price."
5,Bruce's Spiritual Masterpiece,"I know Bruce, even in the 70's, has always tried to distance himself from the Comtemporary Christian Music scene - and I can understand why. However, this work should be required listening for every CCM artist. It is wonderful in every way; from it's joyful, poetic, never heavy-handed lyrics to superb musicianship. A case could definitely be made that this is Bruce's finest work. Every song is a success; there is no low point. The remastering makes this cd sound better than ever. The only disappointment is the 2 new instrumentals, which add nothing to an already perfect album."
5,"For the $$$, a great machine","I'm not reloading for competitive shooting - it's a hobby. For the dollars and a progressive machine, Lee's hard to beat. Lee's inexpensive enough to be able to afford extra turrets, die set and shell carriers to keep each caliber with it's own set up. Love it!"
4,Perhaps the best of the series,"This is the second of the westerns in the Gents series. In my opinion, it is the most satisfying book in the series. It contains enough gunfights, humor, sex and history to make the book a delight for intelligent readers. The Gents (Riley Stokes and Cas McCasland) decide to make easy money by becoming bounty hunters. They set out to collect the bounty on an innocent man who has fled to Palo Duro. The change from bounty hunters to rescuers is facilitated by the beautiful sister of the wanted man. As in the first book in this series, Thorstad has created a very interesting set of characters -- even the guys in black hats are enjoyable."
1,Horrible Waste of Money,"I bought two of these cots for a 3 day camping trip and one of them ripped on the second day. They are ridiculous to assemble, and they obviously aren't as durable as they state they are. I weigh well under the maximum weight limit and they totally ripped apart. I would suggest spending more money on something reliable like a Coleman Cot."
1,Save your money,Amen to the other 1 star reviewers. I have little to add since my experience was so similar. I used one on a camping trip and gave the other to a friend. We're both well under the weight limit. Mine lasted 2 nights and his 3. It's unpleasant to have a rip happen in the middle of the night! At least the metal frame was recyclable.
1,"Extremely difficult to put together, fabric ripped",Bought this for our <100 pound son for Boy Scouts. Even my husband had a difficult time putting it together and ultimately needed a tool to modify it slightly. Our son sat on it and the fabric ripped.
3,"not perfect, but there are pluses...","Although it takes a little muscle to get the poles into the pockets and create support suspension, it was very stable and held up well (I weigh 140lbs at 5'9""). I found it durable enough for several camping trips I've used it for so far - it's very light for a cot and I really can't complain about it's overall construction - heavy duty and easy to figure out. The cot saved my back and legs; as well as kept me off the ground. Good buy overall"
1,challenging cot,I purchased 3 of these and it took my husband and I a solid 30 minutes to assemble the first one...working together...it was a struggle to say it kindly. The directions are very simple...as is the set up's design. We could not easily assemble the two long sections of poles into the canvass because it was extremely tight...about 11/2 inches too short. I called for help and they then told me that you won't be able to get the ends in place until you had slept on it for several days...because the canvass has to be stretched first and only your prolonged body weight would accomplish that. No where in the instructions did it say that. We gave them away to Goodwill. There would be no way my kids would have assembled it.
1,Poor Product Quality/Worse Return Policy,"I purchased two of these Texsport Steel Collapsible Cots. During night two of sleeping in them, one ripped significantly. The individual sleeping in it was well under the weight limit. Thinking this could not be the norm, we used the other cot an additional night and it ended up tearing through as well.When we tried to return them we were given the following response, ""...we issue a full refund when an item is returned in new condition within 30 days of the day you received it from us. You can still return the item, and we'll issue you a partial refund."" We should have received a full refund BECAUSE we could not return the item in new condition.We didn't return the cots since we would have to pay shipping and handling and were not sure if we would receive ANY refund (since we did not use the cots for the first time until after the 30 days were up)."
1,Flimsy,This cot is extremely flimsy and it is difficult to force in place when putting it together. It is easy to tip over when sleeping. It would only be useful for a small child.
1,Never Again,I bought three of these cots as a gift for a friend's family. They are not very well constructed at all. The first time they were used my six-year-old son and my friend's ten-year-old boy both ripped through the fabric of their cots on the first night we were out. I saw this happen myself. The boys weren't bouncing on the cots; they were simply crawling across them to exit the tent.
1,SO SMALL.,I'm a woman and not very broad or tall but this cot is too small for me. I think this cot would be only good for a child. It is impossible for an adult to sleep comfortable on this because it is so narrow that your arms fall off the sides! It's also a pain overall to put together. You have to join some cot bars to form the sides and the cot bars do NOT stay together and will come apart while assembling this and inside of the canvas material. The legs are a pain to put on as well and you have to bend them a lot before you can even get them to stay in. I also feel like this cot is pretty flimsy and have been scared when I sleep on it that I am going to fall through. I have tried turning on my side to see if it will help with the narrowness and it doesn't work at all. This cot is just really bad. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,One thing I don't like about this cot...,"We bought this cot because our grand-daughter was quickly outgrowing her child-size cot. It's very sturdy and will work for her for many years. My one major complaint is the way the legs are shaped. They taper in from the body of the cot to the floor. When she gets up most times the cot tips to the side, but, it wasn't specifically made for a child. It's not far from the floor so chances are she wouldn't be hurt."
4,Surprised at the easy assembly,"The reviews I read talked about needing tools to pull the material over the bars. I was concerned, but the product was already on its way. Got them today and assembled easily. Problem is the directions are poor. However, easy to assemble and light. Also laid on the cot and found it much more comfortable than the ground. Husband and I are over 40 years and planning an overnight backpacking trip. I hope that they work well."
1,Cheap,These were the cheapest cots. Took them camping and got one put together my 7 year old son sat on it and it ripped instantly. He weighs less than 50lbs. Didnt even bother to use the other two we order. Would not recommend......
4,Trick for easy assembly,"I've noticed a lot of reviewers mentioning the difficulty fitting the frame into the canvas cover. I too experienced this (I attribute it to poor fit and design at manufacturing), but discovered a relatively easy fix. Do this for each of the main side frames: find the end your feet would be on, pop off the rubber cap, use hacksaw (or for kids, have an adult do this) carefully to cut about an inch off (depending on the fit of your cot it might take slightly more or less) the end of the pipe, then pop the rubber cap back on. I did this, and the frame fit into the case very easily and the canvas still stayed adequately stretched.Other than that, this cot is very handy. While probably a bit too bulky and space-inefficient to pack on extended hiking trips, this is light enough to be worthwile on shorter trips and for base camping. Definitely a good bargain if you can catch it on a good sale (I think I paid around $15)."
5,It is actually useful,"I used to have one of those when I was a kid. It was made in the USSR, and I think they might have invented them. The one I had was made out off much heavier gauge of steel and was virtually indestructible, but it weight a bit more. It saw a LOT of use. I lost it when I was moving. I bough this one from amazon and although it feels a bit lighter and slightly cheaper I believe it will serve me well on my camping trips."
5,"Lightweight, travel bag, fits in hiker backpack","I bought this cot to travel to Central America and stay at houses of people I know who might not have extra beds.This is a perfect option for you if you are traveling around and need a really compact cot. It comes with a cotton bag that easily fits all the pieces. I even carried it on the plane (granted, after TSA wanted to check out the metal poles).I am 5'5"" and about 150lbs. I easily fit on this cot. It's length is perfect for me, and the elevated head is a good feature. With a regular bed pillow, this is a comfortable sleeping arrangement. Just don't roll over or you'll end up on the floor :)"
4,Texsport Cot review,I ordered this cot upon a recommendation of a friend who used it. It was difficult for me to stretch the canvas over the metal tubes the 1st time - my husband helped me. I stacked quite a bit of weight on the cot for 3 days to stretch it and that helped a lot. I was able to assemble it very easily myself on the Atlanta Breast Cancer 3 Day walk. It was very comfortable for sleeping and great to sit upon while getting dressed. Beats sitting on the ground. I also stored ziplock bags of clothes and shoes underneath. I highly recommend this product.
4,Self-Parenting: The Complete Guide to Your Inner Converstns.,"The information provided in Self-Parenting was written with great clarity, which makes this book easy to understand and use. The ideas conveyed here were also done with love and nurturing. Both my inner child and I LOVED the whimsy of the illustrations and large print. It's a very well-written book and a great tool. I've used this technique in the past and found it very helpful. I expect to get back to it in the near future."
2,So So!,"The DVD was delivered timely and the price was good, but the DVD coverbox was in very poor condition - I was giving it as a gift to someone that needed the 4th season of Sanford. Next time I'll order new."
3,Rough Beginnings,"This is Giant Sand's first album, and it's a rough start. The sage-like whisper speak-sing of present day Howe Gelb is but a twinkle in Howe Gelb's eye. What we get here is a young Gelb who is finding his way. There's some good songs here, but the performances lack feel and subtlety. Howe hasn't found his 'voice' here; instead he tends to shout his way through the songs. While its fun to hear Howe and Company feeling their way through the early parts of their career, the album wears out it's welcome before it's over. These days, I pass this one over in favor of the many many masterpieces he'd create a few years down the line."
1,Lasted about 1 year....,"I bought this Batman TV for my son on his 4th Birthday, he is now 5 and the TV no longer works. He never messed with the TV, it was up high on his dresser and when he wanted to watch something I turned it on for him. I went to turn it on one day and you could hear the sound but you could only see a small line of picture across the middle of the tv. Yes if looks cool but sure didnt last long!"
5,A Cup of what your Soul needs,This book should be on every Christian theologians' bookshelf. If you can't stop to read something this good- you have little business meddling in the affairs of God who is rich in flavor and is the life - full of energy and zest. Mr. Sweet uses words like honey to describe the world as he sees it and as we can see it through a spiritually awakened frame of mind and soul. I came away feeling refreshed like never in my life- by a book that is.. Those who want to fulfill their hearts' longings and those who want to bettter understand the God of this universe- get your copy and share it with others! Even those who just need to regroup and get a new perspective on their lives will benefit by reading.
2,Do not waist your time,"This book is worthless book for reading expect you are a junior sales manager in a young company. The writer has no contribution or practical suggestions for sales management but a lot of junk and words collection of sales management. So I'd rather like to call this book as ""My First Dictionary for Sales Management""."
2,No Secrets Here,"... I was hoping for something very insightful and original. Unfortunately for me, I found neither.What I found is a superficial treatment of the subject and seven not-so secrets such as: have a vision, set goals, be a leader, etc. Most of these ""secrets"" are so general that this book could, with a few changes, be a manual for Girl Scout Leaders or almost anyone else.For example, on leadership: ""One of your responsibilities as a leader will be to develop a training system. This system includes visual components such as posters, videos, 35 mm slides, overhead transparencies, role modeling, tricks, devices, and a lot of pop psycology."" Where's the beef? Where's the recognition that tricks, devices, 35 mm slides, etc. went out years ago. Content is the draw today. People want substantive help to do their job better.All this is not to say that the book wouldn't be helpful for a rookie sales manager. ..."
2,Spend your money elsewhere...,"This book, uninsightful, unimaginative, and full of platitudes was, unequivocally, the worst book I've read in long time. Its author obviously prefers looking up the work of others rather than bring anything significantly new to the table. I was very disheartened."
3,just a plain cover,I sent this cover back and ordered a heavier set. This was very generic looking( like a grill cover) and I was not happy with it visually. If all you need is a cover and dont mind what this looks like then you'll probably be happy with it. measurements were accurate.
4,Just great!,"I bought a 3 piece set for my porch with a very irregular shapes, so it will be dificult to find a cover to fit and protect the three pieces together, and I didn't want to spend a lot buying 3 different covers. So I ordered this one, and I can protect the entire set perfectly because of it size; besides that, the material has a very good quality and the velcro that has on it corners can be attached to the furniture and protect it from the wind, the sunlight and rain as I need.Great product!"
3,"Fits great, not for homes with dogs","I put this on my outdoor sofa and the fit was great since I have a longer size wicker sofa. Also they tie down the edges to the sofa with velcro which keeps it from blowing off, but some dogs chewed holes in it and ruined it the first week I had it. So, if there are animals around you might want a thicker plastic."
2,Torn within 9 months,At first I thought that this cover would last years as it appeared to be very durable. After 9 months of use it tore in1 place on the area that covers the cushions. I would have assumed it would last at least 2 years.
4,Very nice.,"Very nice. They appear to be heavy duty and well made. We haven't been through a winter yet, so I need to see how that goes. Hopefully there will be no cracks or tears."
2,Not Waterproof,"I purchased 3 of these covers, based upon good reviews, to cover our new patio furniture. Although it is well constructed, it did not protect the furniture from the Florida Summer Storms.We notice that water was actually condensating on the inside of the cover. The inside felt material was completely wet in certain places, especially near the top.Pros:- Good Construction / Size / Weight- Good protection from SunCons:- Not as Waterproof as we had hope."
