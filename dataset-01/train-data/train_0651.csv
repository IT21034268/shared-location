4,"Good, though in German.",Peter Lorre is great! It is amazing when you remember that the movie is from 1930. Glad I saw it.
4,"5-star film, 4-star DVD","M is an essential film. But this DVD was a little disappointing, I felt. The picture and sound were better than other versions I've seen, but still not as pristine as I would have liked. Special features were so-so. Price was as high as Criterion usually likes it. All in all, I've seen better adaptations of similarly legendary films to DVD.But if you are at all interested in the great films of the past, this is a must-have, and Criterion MUST be kept in business at all costs (wince). So this is a good buy overall."
3,In all fairness to Criterion,"This movie sounds VERY intriguing to me and I will probably purchase it... however, in fairness to the complaints about the Criterion transfer specifically, the lines at the top of the frame, I sent an email to Jon Mulvaney (who responds nearly immediately to ANY questions you have about Criterion releases) and I quote his reply:""The line that you are referring to was caused by the optical printer during the creation of the original film elements of M. Most video versions have cropped out the line, therefore deleting almost 25% of the picture. We choose not to, making our decision in consultation with the restoration group who did the work from original film elements in Germany. We've tried to correct the problem as much as possible, but no matter what, it can be distracting. Even Fritz Lang knew about this.""As you would expect from them, Criterion did the best they could do (as ALWAYS!)."
1,"Criterion DVD: excellent sound, but far from perfect picture","I own a beamer and normally see quite well how a film was transfered. Here, the picture isnt clear, you can't distinguish faces far off, cannot even read the newspaper-article, though I am certain you can on the source that was used for the transfer. I certainly hoped for better stuff, and now will have to to tape the film from an emission on TV and dub the sound or something similar. A disappointing transfer indeed!"
3,This may have been shocking back in the day,"Peter Lorre was the highlight of this film. But, after watching this film, I am confused as to what exactly was so horrifying. I see far more horrifying images on the nightly news. Peter Lorre's character is never fully developed - as a viewer you have no insight into his dementia. It would have been a far better film to have been better informed as to his past insanity. If you are expecting a modern psychological thriller - you will be disappointed. It may be impossible for such an old film to have the intense psychological impact of modern films."
2,dated,"Maybe this shocked in its day, but it's terribly dated, with long dialogue scenes that could have been condensed way down. Interesting to see Peter Lorre so young and speaking German. But I thought I'd be caught up in the actual movie, but was forced to watch it as a piece of film history, like a college film class. The one thing that prevents film from being the greatest art form is movies date so quickly. This is a perfect example."
1,"Will Die, Don't Buy","It's very simple, everything I have ever owned by SimpleTech has died on me including this SD Card, 4 USB sticks, 1 Hard DRive, and 1 CF card. Not one of their products lasted me more than 2 years and caused me a lot of headache."
5,For fans and students of baseball,"I always look forward to baseball games when Jerry Remy is in the broadcast booth because he continually teaches me new things about the sport. This book is full of those insights, all written in Remy's entertaining, conversational voice."
3,Christmas Gift,"This was a Christmas gift for my nephew. It was on the top of his list. He enjoyed it very much, but did pass it up for other gifts. He seemed to get bored with it rather quickly. It has cool sound and light effects. It does move about, but kids seem to prefer the remote controls. Overall it was a nice gift and he does like it, but I don't know if I would purchase it again."
3,"Great toy, but most important feature stopped working!","The main reason why we bought this product, was because of the go ape feature. The toy worked well for about two weeks, but then the go ape feature stopped working. We changed the battery, but there was no change. I called Mattel and explained the problem to them. I was instucted to return the product to them (at my expense)and they would exchange it for a brand new one(they would cover shipping cost)."
3,King carnivore malfunctions a lot!,"I purchased two of these because my boys fell in love with them when they saw them. One of them was fine, the other seemed like the batteries were drained right away. We switched the batteries and the same thing happened so we exchanged it for a new one. It worked one time and the same thing happened. My kids were dissappointed, so I called fisher-price/mattel. They were suprisingly helpful, they are sending a return label so that we won't have to pay postage to return them, and that helps a lot because they are so big and bulky. The bottom line was that they will pay for our return and send out new ones, which they insist will be in perfect working order because they are coming directly from them. So, I am quite satisfied, although only time will tell if the new ones malfunction!"
2,"When it works, it's fun.","this was our son's only requested gift. he loved it, but after two days it stopped working properly. we returned it for a new one and again after a few days it didn't work. we returned it and got our money back."
2,"Unreliable - often requires ""restart""","My 3-year-old twins like this toy, but it is difficult to use (won't always snap back down), and it frequently stops working. Usually turning it off and on again fixes it, but not always. I'm surprised something this buggy got to market."
1,What a waste of money!!,"I purchased this truck as a Christmas gift. As a parent of 5 children (boys ages 12, 10, 8 and 2 and one girl age 2) I was happy to see how much they enjoyed it.But by New Years Day it was done for. We changed the batteries and nothing. My children are so disappointed and heartbroken.Just a total shame.I wouldn't recommend this truck to anyone."
2,Fun while it lasted!,"This is such a cool toy. My 5 year old begged for this over and over again. It was the number one thing on his Christmas list last year. It is very inconsistent. Half the time, if not more, King doesn't pop out which is the best feature of the toy. I hope they do something to fix the design problems because it would be fun. Within six months it was malfuctioning."
4,Adorable!,"My 3 1/2 year old wanted it for Xmas and it's quite entertaining. My son is actually just as happy with the truck features but I think the ape popping out, making the screeching sounds, and pounding on his chest is hilarious.My only complaint is that my son can't push it back into truck mode on his own."
1,It simply doesn't work!!,"I bought this product thinking I'd have a PDF generator that was cost effective and would be simple to use. WRONG! Firstly files that I've saved suddenly wouldn't open and had to be generated and saved again - and again - and yet again! Then, files I've emailed to people sometimes won't open (I sent 3 files to 1 person - he could open 2 but not the 3rd!). Finally the software just stopped working altogether when I'd done NOTHING to my PC (this after about 7 days). Finally, the customer service is non existant. You have to post messages on a forum - and no one has as yet answered mine (the forum is full of questions asking for fixes to various bugs - that is, its like a beta version you're buying), and finding an email address is nearly impossible - I think I found one for the customer care dept, but as no one has bothered to answer it I'm not so sure.My advise in one breath is quite simple - AVOID IT!!!!"
4,Billy's back again,It's great to hear Billy Preston again. I'm still waiting for his classic albums to become available on CD. The music is this new CD is really good. He still knows how to play that organ. The vocals are a little slurred at times which slightly take away from the over all effect. Still a good effort after being away for so long. PS Get those other alblums converted to CD's for us.
1,Why we got these terrible reviews?,The former reviews are simple terrible. I suppose that they were'made' by samsung as well?
2,Not very good drums,"The drums aren't very good on this CD...I don't listen to the wurds on CDs, so I don't even know whut is it abut. I hate this!"
5,Hate Crimes,"This book is great for learning about the definition of hate crimes, even though a universal definition is still not completely agreed upon.A great book if you are taking a class on Domestic Terrorism and Hate Crime, as I am."
2,Very Poor Range,"Features and sound quality are great, BUT the range I experienced was horrible. I tried moving the base unit around my house but the range never improved. I have a couple of 2-3 year old 900Mhz phones that provide at least 3 times the range of this phone. I also noticed the phone causes nearby radios (stereo, clock-radio) to buzz. I love Sony products, but this was one of my worst experiences ever with them."
3,jog wheel device,"My problem with this phone is that I cannot dial a sequenceof numbers by hitting a sequence of memory buttons. Therefore I cannot conveniently use it with my very inexpensive long distance service, which involves first dialing an 800 number, then dialing a password number, then dialing the number to be called. Other than this, which was the reason I bought the phone, it seems fine."
4,VGT-4 Monopod,Nice light weight pod I use for Video and Still. Takes the wiggle out of your video and allows me to use the zoom more effectively on both. The Monopod is quick to set up and move. Only negatives are it would be nice to have a second shoe for the cameras. (I suspect they are available) and the release clips are a little tight - my 9 yr old has trouble with them.
2,Cheap but inadequate,"Don't buy this if all you want is a cheap, functional monopod. Alhough it has a quick release plate, the head has no tilt function, which limits youto using your slr only in horizontal composition mode. I ended up buying a separate ballhead, which raised the cost of this monopod to almost twice what I had intended to spend.I would have been better off getting a good quality one like Manfrotto or one of the cheap models available on ebay."
3,Good for using on little fun outings.,Length:: 2:48 MinsPros.1. Fast Assembly2. Light3. Tall4. Boot attaches quickly5. Good for small light weight cameras6. Base screws off letting you take advantage of the original threading.Cons.1. Boot doesn't come off easily2. Not for heavy cameras3. Stabilization pedal doesn't work.
3,Molly Donnelly,"""Molly Donnelly"" is an ordinary girl who's life changed suddenly because of the attack of the Japanese in Pearl Harbor. Her world of innocence had become a reality of parent to children continous battles and bigger battles such as the lives of friends and family members at war. This book has bought a new perspective of World War II in the eyes of a teenage girl. Jean Thesman had given readers of all ages a view of the past which changed America forever in the year 1941 on December 7. It showed how life as teenagers were during the war. Jean Thesman had done a terrific novel!"
4,Wonderful!,"It was a great book and I enjoyed it very much, but some of the characters didn't seem very much alive to me, except for Molly. Jean Thesman wrote a wonderful book, I hope she can continue the story of Molly Donnelly, but thats just wishful thinking...=)"
5,Jean Thesman has outdone herself.,This book is very excellent.IT showws very clearly the changed life of a young girl in World War 2
4,Snow White (DVD w Diana Rigg),"I watched this with my five-year-old granddaughter. We both liked it, but my granddaughter got restless during the singing. It departs from the usual story in how the wicked queen dresses when she tries to kill Snow White. My granddaughter had lots of questions but accepted my explanation that different people tell stories differently. My granddaughter likes the Disney version better; and there is another live actor version out that my granddaughter also likes better than this one."
4,"Something old, something new.","I personally prefer the ""old"" dwarf names(Sneezy, Doc, Grumpy. etc.) but greatly enjoyed this version of a delightful tale. Of course, I did get it for my granddaughter so she will be the final arbiter. Congrats to Amazon for offering such a delightful video."
4,Snow White - Cannon Films 1987,"Sometimes this version of snow white can be a little creepy, particularly for younger viewers. It's very different from the Disney version so don't buy it if that's the kind of story that you want. I grew up watching this edition and I love it. The songs are very catchy but have a tendency to get stuck in my head all day. Overall very enjoyable."
1,Worst movie I ever bought,"I think I must have hit the wrong key on the computer when I bought this movie, it is beyond terrible. At best it is a camp version of Snow White. What a waste of Diana Rigg's talent. The seven dwarfs are probably the best characters in the movie, but even they can't save it."
2,Weird and ...... weird....,"Fun, but not as much fun as I remember it being. This is silliness, but when you're not really exhausted, drinking, or in a silly mood, this movie just sort of bores you. It really drags in places (no pun intended) and in others it's just not funny. Good for when you don't care enough to rent the very best."
3,"Fun. Blinding, nauseating fun.",After viewing this movie I was only able to see about three of the colors of the color spectrum. I still liked though.
3,A Drag Queen Explosion,"In the far distant future, a theft of priceless jewels with mysterious properties lead three agents to set down on a planet to investigate--but alas, they are men, and it's a ""women only planet."" What to do? Why, pop a pill and turn into women, of course!Not all the performers are men in drag--the cast is filled out with quite a few busty-babes who are more than capable of giving their genderbending co-stars a run for their tassels--but if you enjoy drag queens, VEGAS IN SPACE is the movie for you. And for the most part, the male-to-female performers are expert in their work--which ranges ultra-high camp to occasional bouts of good old fashioned tacky. The script is silly, the cinematography, sets, special effects, and virtually everything else about the film is cheap. But the performers make it fun, with Doris Fish heading the line up. Watch out the Queen of Police doesn't bust ya for wearing beige!"
5,Excellent History,"This is an excellent history/documentary of America's most famous and popular passenger train of the post-world-two era prior to the comming of Amtrak. The book is very accurate includes many photos, car diagrams,etc."
5,Incubus meets Limp Bizkit!!,"This is a awesome nu-metal album. If you love Limp Bizkit and Incubus, you will love Blindspott. This band also uses turntables to help create a breathtaking musical world. Not one of the songs on this album can be considered as bad. Ofcourse somg songs or better than others. You can play this album from beginnig to end. I strongly reccomend bying this album because it's among the best that nu-metal has to offer."
3,Would be good for a parent just finding out their child had a developmental disability.,I would have found this helpful if it was the first book that I had read on communicating with a special child. I had read others however and I found the information to be repetitive.
1,Poor Binding,I bought this book for my grandson for his first birthday and had written in it before I gave it to him. The first time after that that I opened it to read it to him--it had just been unwrapped and had been untouched by anyone else but me up until that moment--the binding ripped. This is a children's book and should be surdier. I now have the book and don't know what to do with it!
3,Old Bugs In a Box titles are better...,"The Bugs in a Box series is great--my kids have enjoyed them for years and now my two-year-old loves them. However, I have found his more recent ventures to lack the quality and spark of his original works: Bugs In Boxes, More Bugs In Boxes, How Many Bugs in a Box, etc. While I would still recommend this book, David A. Carter's original pop-ups were more complex, more clever and more sturdy. If you haven't purchased any, I would start with the aforementioned books first."
4,"If you love pop-ups, you'll love this book!","I love this book - I've ordered several as gifts. I was a little disapointed in the last two I ordered - pieces were missing and/or parts not working. Happily, Amazon was quick to exchange them at no extra cost to me. I love all of David Carter's pop-up books and have ordered many of them!"
5,Turn the lights off!,"This is surprisingly very good and spooky. The host is a historian and a great story teller. He tells of urban legends and haunted roads, houses and cemetaries in Ohio. A lot of fun. I'm very glad I purchased this. Turn the lights down and picture youself in front of a campfire - and listen to the chilling tales of faceless phantoms and drowned spirits trying to gain access to a home - and the Hook Man! Great stuff! His narratives of his own personal experiences with haunted roads are the most chilling. Very informative and definitely not boring!"
1,Handspring Prism Battery,"did not need the battery after the order and contacted the seller for return and they did not respond at allI ""recyled"" the new batttery"
5,U Memmer,"The first time I got to see him was on Que Locos. His material is so realistic. This c.d. is very Humorous, I highly recommend to buy this c.d. Right Now, Right Now. If you like Carlos Mencia, you will like George Lopez."
5,Funniest live act ever!,"This is by far the funniest latino comedy live act I have ever heard. This is also my favorite George Lopez act aswell. Me being hipsanic finds this extremely funny, even my non hispanic friends find this hilarious."
5,"New to me, but glad I heard this.","Every once in a while, I hear music from some one that is really set apart from all the others. The craft and artistry in this CD are the result of a mature and skillfull performer. It is refreshing to hear from someone with vison rather than imitation. I had never heard of this artist until he was the opening act in my small local flok music club. I felt like I was hearing a combination of Bob Dylan, John Prine, Bill Morrisey and Bruce Springsteen with a whole lot of parts that I could not identify, except that it was very good. Buy this CD and others from JP Jones, see him if you can. IT will register as a very memorable evening."
1,This does NOT EXIST ANYWHERE,"I have ordered this ""guitar"" twice from 2 different vendors and it does not exist. The first vendor cancelled the order and the second one sent me a paperback book. I had to return the book to get them to refund my money. What a waste of time and effort. How it ever got entered into the system is a mystery to me."
1,I did not order a book!!!,"For the second time now I've tried to order a 12 string guitar and recieved a book.Why? If your thinking of ordering this product ,don't bother,spend 10 dollars more and on a different product,you too will finally get a real guitar. P.S.Amazon should remove this item a.s.a..p."
1,Did not get what I ordered,"This product is advertised as a pack of decals, but is in reality just a single bumper sticker. The seller claimed it was a mistake made by a second party. I would return it, but the cost to mail it back would be near to what I paid for the product itself. I would not order from this company in the future."
5,Continued excellent work,"Unlike other bands, Overkill continues to pound out hard hitting heavy metal. This album is raw and hard, Blitz and D.D. have changed but not changed Overkill's sound again.It starts with Thunderhead, chugs full steam into Bleeding Me and keeps punching with What I'm Missin'. I don't want to go over every song but this album simply does not relent in it's neck-snapping, ear pounding groove. I will say this, Can't Kill a Dead Man has ""the sound"". Dave Linsk does something that sends shivers down my spine and the song itself just keeps coming.My favorite album is still From the Undeground and Below but I'm going to recommend this album to heavy metal fans, because Overkill fans already have it.It's going to be awhile before this album leaves the disc changer."
3,excuse me have you seen the real overkill,"better than necroshine but they still seem lost?i forgot what we did before this ? and what kind of music do we play again?not classic overkill bobby slap dd and then reverse,please.wake up"
5,A Training Guide That Works,"This is a great training guide. Many training methods are discussed, enabling the reader to use the methods best suited to their cat's personality. Also, the stories of real life results aid understanding in a fun way. Being a professional parrot trainer didn't specifically prepare me for training my first kitten. This book helped teach me how cats learn."
3,"Satisfied with service, design is not as interesting as thought",The little flowers around the clock face were more abstract and less flower like. It is a bit of a disappointment. The band is really nice though.
3,I'd check it out from the library,"When I was suffering from morning sickness with my first pregnancy, I think I bought every book out there, looking for relief. This book wasn't horrible, but it wasn't that helpful either. In fact, I bought it because of the previous reviews and now I can't believe it got 5 stars. If you just want to know someone else has been through it, or some perspective, then this book will be helpful. If you want something to make your morning sickness go away, or even lessen, then good luck. Try spending the money on motion sickness wristbands instead."
3,OK For The Money,"I am on a tight budget at the moment but wanted a wide angle lens to practice with. This works fine, can't compare it to anything else because it is my first but looks well made and fits fine on my Olympus Evolt R410.Ok for the $20 I paid for it."
3,Not a wise purchase if you are looking for some great snaps,I am using an old camera so did not want to pay more for the lens. I bought this lens in $9 and it worked for me. In some cases I got distortions in the images and it does not work very well with zoom. So I would recommend that if you are looking for precision photography it is not a wise choice. But then I got some nice photo out of this as well..... :)
2,"Great expectations, unmet","The author is a very good mathematician (and a grandfather of Google) so I was expecting a short and lucid introduction to dynamical system. Imagine my sadness when I found the book barely comprehensible. Apparently, the author learned his writing skills in Russian in the 60s, where paper was scarce, and any sort of explanation was viewed a waste thereof. If you actually want to understand dynamics, Katok/HasselblattIntroduction to the Modern Theory of Dynamical Systems (Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications)is vastly superior."
3,disappointed...,"I expected some funny stories, jokes, etc. like her wonderful videosbut this book only contains some short sweet affirmations."
2,I own this set too,"I've had this set since it came out and I agree with the other reviewer. The plates are scratched from knife/fork marks, the edges of two plates have chipped, and the plate thickness varies...two are heavier than the others while two are thinner, which happen to be the ones that have chipped edges.I regret having spent so much money on this set, with all the accessories. If I could do it over, this is NOT the set I would buy. It is not a good investment."
1,Pfaltzgraff makes louzy dinnerware,We bought a complete set of French Quarter dinnerware plus accessories less than two years ago. Now the design has faded so badly you can hardly see it and the glaze shows every knife and fork mark. I know from others who own other Pfaltzgraff designs that the same things happens. DON'T buy this brand. Their glaze is not durable.
4,Not a bad book.,I am an American who lived in Bulgaria for two years all over the country. I learned Bulgarian fairly rigorously. I liked this book because it helped teach me some of the intricacies of Bulgarian through studying the dialogues which are very good. The book also gives fairly good explanations of grammar rules.The book could have been organized better. Some of the phrases used in the book were either really old phrases or phrases that were hardly ever used. I would sometimes learn certain phrases and Bulgarians would tell me that they had never heard that phrase before.All and all probably the best book out there for a more advanced study of Bulgaria.
4,Enlightening with many foresights.,"Worth even for professionals who are in the finance world for many years to read and contemplate. What is happening around the finance world could be something that no one has experienced before and this book serves to outline a future world for the finance world. Even though some of the arguments might appear a bit radical, nevertheless it is still depicting a picture that's worth reading"
1,"Blurry pics, very slow response time","Why buy a no-name brand digital camera when you have better choices? I'd stick with a Canon or Minolta, some models even cost the same as this generic-looking camera with horrible pic quality. Looks and fels flimsy, too. Go for a Canon."
4,Vanguard Mars-1 Tripod,"The Mars-1 tripod is extremely well made and the sturdiest tabletop model around. Crafted very much like their full size tripods, Vanguard did an excellent job designing this smaller unit which is handy for travel and macro. Features include a three way pan and tilt head with quick shoe, heavy duty braced expandable legs with snap locks that actually work, geared center post and even a spirit level. Unlike most flimsy lightweight small tripods, this one has the capacity to safely hold my Nikon D200 securely. The only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 would be that on Vanguard's site it is described with a carrying bag which is NOT included (and they don't offer one for sale). Due to its rather hefty construction, even when folded it has too large a diameter to fit into any of the travel tripod cases. Luckily, I discovered after a lengthy search that a padded Lowepro Lens Case 5 fits great. Bottom line the Mars-1 is an excellent product at a great price on Amazon!"
3,Try before you buy.,"Eden is a beautiful, lady-like fragrance with white florals that I not only tolerate but I like as well.Eden smells very green too me. However, Eden is not a typical prim & dry green, nor is it a cool & icy one. Instead, Eden is a sweet, warm & wet green. Among green florals, sweet, warm, & wet is a fairly unique, imo, which may account for some of the negative reactions to it. Eden has strong similarities to one of my favorites greens, HM Haute Couture, which is sweet & dry, yet cool, in comparison to Eden.A word of caution. Being sweet & wet, Eden is on the edge of cloying. It needs a light hand, and it's best for cool weather.Definitely one to try before you buy."
4,review,"I am a student of indian classical music. This book and cd is very interesting and quite well made for an overview of the pillars of indian classical music. For the everyday person exploring the genre, looking for a wide range of material and songs that are not full length this is a great buy. It is well made and recorded with great artists. The book has wonderful information for each of the raags. For those with more knowledge of what raags, artists and instruments they prefer to listen to will find that much of the music feels stunted or incomplete as they are very short but very nice recordings."
5,enchantment of the senses,The Raga guide is a portal to a world of exquisite beauty. Chaurasia on flute and buddhadev das gupta on Sarod churn raga after raga in an unending merry go round of enchantment .The vocalists especially pandit vyas touch human chords as never before. A must have for those seeking a deeper meaning of life and the inner peace and beauty of Hindustani classical music. This is one treasure that must not be missed.
4,Pretty Good Multimeter,"First meter didn't work, as battery terminals were corroded. The replacement works fine. Readings are large and easy to see. The temperature probe is very handy, but fragile. The high voltage detection is a good feature. This is a feature rich unit; I would buy it, again."
2,Poor quality - good features,"I ordered this meter because I really wanted something that would do it all. This unit has a great combination of features for the price.Unfortunately some of those features did not work ""out of the box"". If you take a closer look, the quality of the meter is not bad, but as you would expect, it does not compare with the professional meters. I am one of those people who buys a tool and expects it to last a lifetime and so I decided to give up the thermocouple, spend a lot more money and bought a Fluke. The price was considerably higher, but I was replacing a digital meter and an analog meter that both had died, so I felt it was time to bite the bullet and get the better meter."
4,"Works perfectly, but this one is a bit pricey","This unit has lots of features and a very high quality feel. You can press a button near an outlet and it tells you if there is power there, without plugging anything into that outlet. Good for identifying which plugs are on which circuit. It does just about everything you could want and has a very large display.The big mall store that sells lots of tools has a unit very similar to this one on sale all the time for less than a quarter of the price. This one is great, but look there first. Such a large price differential is really not excusable."
2,"Bad continuity, but ok meter","Multimeter seems to work fine and has good build quality. Great deal at 20 bucks.My only complaint is that the continuity beep is terribly static-y which ended up being a big deal for me. I felt that I needed to hold the probes and sometimes move them around on the contacts to get the continuity beeper to work. The beep sound it makes is pretty awful. I don't think it is the speaker though, rather the signal going to it.I tried this one after I tried the MN35...which had the exact same problem.I am going to stay away from Extech for a while, I think the algorithm/circuit they use to check continuity is messed up."
2,Not very accurate,While the unit overall has a solid feel the accuracy lacks a bit. Mine read 4.95 volts for a precision 5.00V. The temperature reading was off by 3F compared to a precision temp meter. I expected a better product from Extech.I returned this unit and bought a Fluke which costs about twice as much but has the accuracy I need.
3,"Meter Ok, but No Thermocouple Probles","The meter seems good, like new in fact, but I am missing my Type K Thermocouple probes.I have sent an email to the vendor. Will follow up.Vendor admits error. I have requested credit of $2.99 for a replacement thermocouple -50 to 250 C.Will Update"
4,Works well for the most part,"Solid construction, appears quite rugged. I certainly don't intend to drop it, but it looks like it could withstand a significant impact. It tends to ""ghost"" and ""drift"" quite a bit, with numbers flashing and constantly changing, as if it was picking up an electrical current in the air. Once it locked onto the current the numbers stabilized and I could get an accurate reading. I'm mainly using it for AC and DC voltages, so I can't tell you how well this works with electronics. It would have been better if it came with at least a minimal case to protect the screen, but I'll come up with something."
3,"It works, figure from what I read it be more.","The non-contact AC voltage detector does not seem to work very well. Even if you hold up to the socket it does not always work. Directions are not very good. I bought for the non-contact AC voltage detector and capacitance. I had a compaticitor to test and it may be me, but did realize I had to change the mode when set on cap. Even after that I still not sure if it was working. I guessing for the price its ok, better then others at that cost."
5,"Great Multimeter, Great Price",Cant count how many times this has been used around the house since I purchased it. Not very expensive for all the features packed in it. Great for home use...
5,Replacement VOM,Device is very compact yet full of all the right features. Looks to be very durable and the supplied test leads look to be of good quality. This is a replacement meter for general home handyman and automotive hobbyist activities. I am pleased with the device and just need to adjust to it's differences from my old meter.
4,Rescued from the VHS Wasteland,"The rescuers are top-secret agent mice Miss Bianca (voiced by Eva Gabor) and Bernard (voiced by Bob Newhart) who are called into action when orphaned Penny (voiced by Michelle Stacy) falls into the clutches of the treacherous treasure hunter Madame Medusa (voiced by Geraldine Page) and her henchman, Mr. Snoops (voiced by Joe Flynn). The baddies plan to use the little girl as a diversion when they steal the world's most valuable diamond, The Devil's Eye. But the minuscule mice have big plans to rescue Penny before that can happen.This was always one of my favorite movies as a kid, so it's great that's it is available on DVD finally - it'll teach a whole new generation of young ones that mice speak with Hungarian accents!"
4,This DVD doesn't have a chapter index.,"I have purchased over 20 Disney DVDs, and lots of more other DVDs but I have never seen a single DVD without a chapter index..you know, a paper having the list of all chapters which is holded on the opposite side of the DVD. But ""The Rescuers"" DVD doesn't have that chapter index. It's not much, but it certainly feels as if something big is missing. If there are customers who purchased ""The Rescuers"" WITH the chapter index like other Disney DVDs, would you please post a message here so that I can know that I have received an imcompletely packed DVD?However, I'll give this DVD 4 stars since it's the first time ""The Rescuers"" is realeased in DVD, which I have been waiting for so long."
4,Cute film,"This is a nice classic film from the 70's (if I remember correctly, lol) with talking animals and a kid in distress - typical Disney fare, but you had characters that were funny and entertaining, and villains that were also funny, especially the duo in here wo are after a diamond and want to use a poor orphan girl to get it for them. As far as this movie goes, it's pretty solid Disney fare and should please any longtime Disney fan."
2,Poor Graphics - Difficult Topic for Children,"The graphics on this are very poor. The story of ""abusive"" treatment of a young child is probably not the type of story you want young childern to see."
1,Not As Good As The Book...,"I remember having this story read to me as a little girl, so when I saw the movie was available, I assumed it would be great & ordered it for my 3-year old son. As it turns out, it was a little slow & odd - my husband said it looked like a strange period for Disney as the cartoon did not have all of the thematic & cinematic delights of the older & newer eras...I don't really recommend that anyone actually purchase this unless you know for sure it's a movie you've seen and love! Otherwise, get the book!! It finishes the story in 15 minutes instead of 70+!!!"
4,Offbeat but enjoyable Disney flick,"A superb effort from Disney, as per usual, but quite different to much of their other work. It's much gloomier and more intense than today's spread of Disney films, but still a classic (with plenty of humour and fun) that should keep viewers of any age entertained time and time again. The animation is somewhat gritty, but this adds to the dark atmosphere; the vocal work is outstanding. A winner."
4,"I'm with the other ""Rescuers"" fans!","This movie truly deserves a much better DVD release. As a couple of reviewers have posted, it was speculated that Disney would reissue the DVD in 2007. Well, that year has flown by, and 2008 is almost at an end, and still no sign of a new, improved ""Rescuers"" DVD. Perhaps a 35th anniversary edition in 2012/13?And kind of interesting that young actress Michelle Stacy, the voice of Penny, would a few years later star in the hit comedy ""Airplane!"" as the young girl, when, asked by the young boy if she'd like cream in her coffee, replies with the classic comeback, ""No thank you, I take it black, like my men."" Yep, that was our dear, sweet Penny!"
3,Widescreen--sort of,"Potential buyers should take notice that the ""widescreen"" presentation is achieved by matting the top and bottom of the standard ""Full screen"" image. I'm not sure if this is how the film was originally projected in theaters or not, but it will be immediately obvious to anyone who has viewed the VHS version of the film that you really are getting LESS picture with this release, not MORE.A full screen option would have been nice.Also, the set-top game included is absolutely dull and would be unlikely to hold the interest of even a very young child.It is nice to have a Disney ""True-Life Adventure"" tacked on, though, as well as a Silly Symphony."
4,Movie was in good condition,I hadn't watched it in years and when I got it in the mail and played it. It was like it was new and I loved it.
5,first time viewer at 26 years old,i ordered this movie for my young daughter because its disney and has animals in it. i wasnt expecting too much from it. i watched it also last night for the first time ever and i absolutly loved it!! it was very action packed and the two little mice were sooooooo adorable! it was very adventerous my daughter wanted to watch it over again as soon as we finished it the first time!
1,Horrible,"This is such a horrible movie. This was a Stupid movie. Why did disney make this anyway. Only good thing in the movie is the previews for other movies. Watch Robin Hood, Now that was a good disney movie."
2,Where are the lyrics?,"An enormous disappointment. The popular songs of this period are noteworthy more for their amusing and catchy lyrics than any musical distinction, and yet many of these pieces are strictly instrumental. The background sounds of chatter and dishware make it difficult to understand the lyrics in any case. The CD case is very handsome, yet contains no liner notes, only photos whose relationship to the music is unexplained. If you love the songs of this period, don't waste your money."
3,Sing Along With Mitch Miller revisited,"This is an effort to recreate the popular music of 1900-1910 just as it was sung and performed back then. The vocalists sing in a mannered style which must be meant to copy how performers sang around 1900. The musicians include Don Byron and other contemporary jazz artists but there is no contemporary jazz playing here. For what this CD is, it is no doubt successful. It reminds me of my parents' ""Sing Along With Mitch"" albums by Mitch Miller, in which these songs were also performed in an old time style."
1,What a disappointment,"Great songs and perhaps great performances, but one cannot tell beacause of the background talk and other noise that goes on constantly during the music. I suppose the producers thought this added ""atmosphere"" to the recordings; it spoils them. A waste of time and money on otherwise great early century tunes."
4,Very funny low budget film,Basically Dad is going blind. Mom runs off with the money and another man on a trip around the world. The kids cannot afford to take dad around the world so they fake it. It is amazing how they simulate an around the world trip to a man who is going blind.
5,The Violin CD-Rom Encyclopedia is a must for violinists,"I highly recommend the Multimedia Encyclopedia of the Violin for all violinists, regardless of your age. The amount of information packed into this visually appealing, beautifully conceived disc is invaluable for violinists. In addition, it is so beautifully designed and entertaining that we even gave one to my father, who is not a violinist, but a violin fan. We have been recommending the disc to all our violinist friends.Leslie Harlow, violist"
3,Good historical resource,"Book arrived in excellent condition. Some names are not included in this book, but, overall a very comprehensive list of place names with a short history of the location. If you are a Yosemite enthusiast this is a worthwhile resource. The only reason I give only three stars is because it is missing a few names you might expect. This book is part of the John Muir Sierra Club resource center in Yosemite."
3,lots of potential for a great story but.....,"This book tries to take too many directions. The characters and situations are compelling but, just when it's about to hook you, The Year of Our War goes off on another sub-plot.I would really like to see a more focused look at the world that Steph Swainston has created here. The Year of Our War only gives a teaser of this world."
2,Mieville wannabee,"Swainston is probably the first (or at least the first whom I've read) China Mieville copycat. She populates The Year of Our War with original, absurb creatures, but unlike Mieville, she doesn't make them interesting, believable, or logical. They are scenery; they make cameos, but they never add substance to the story. That's the flaw in this novel: Too much style, not enough substance. Once the weirdness factor becomes familiar, the novel's allure wears off. All of the supporting characters are flat, and the protagonist is barely likable. There is not enough backstory and exposition: For example, some of the characters are immortal yet they die in battle. What's the point of immortality of some thug can stick a knife in your back? The climax and denouement are rushed and unsatisfying. Swainston writes with flair and panache, and I hope that her next work is able to wed her gift for style with a substantial story."
3,pleonasms galore,"Pretentious words -macilent, delitescent, esurient, mordacious. I do love to learn new words but I had to go to the OED because my Merriam Webster didn't have all of the ones she included, some of which were obsolete. Also irritating is her repeated use of comma splices.Those things said, imagination is good, character development is adequate, if barely. Plot jumps around some - I did not really get into this book until page 250, more than I give most books before I dump them. Since it's a trilogy I forgive her for just ending the book, not finishing it.In scifi and fantasy there should be clear indications of who we should learn and who we should not. For instance, the author gives us halfway through a page and half of interesting alien types that we have not met before and we do not meet afterwards. Why? It's like the bar scene in Star Wars. Kind of interesting, but here we don't know if we should try to remember them or not. It's about 50/50 whether I will read the next book."
3,What an imagination - but ....,"I found that I did not warm to the characters as I read the book, however, the world that Steph Swainston created has stayed with me since and I keep thinking back to it. I have to take my hat off to her .. what an imagination!"
1,bad auto shut off.,"This item claims that it's auto shut off but I haven't used this item for a while few months to a year and when I tried to turn it on, the battery went dead."
5,Crystal,"These glasses are very attractive and useful with both everyday and for special occasions. Goblets , wineglasses and other pieces are also available in this pattern"
4,i'm in too deep with the cd,the cd is the bom both edited and regular go to the store and bey this cd doesn't matter if it is edited
5,Another Nice Mellow Album by Thom Brennan,"This is my second album by Thom. Mellow, flowing, and very relaxing, with a hint of space. Thom seems to have a knack for this type of music, and I will be buying more. I also have Mist, which I think is slightly better, but I highly recommend both albums. I wish I had discovered this years ago."
1,Horrible!!,I have 4 children and I have been through hundreds of sippy cups and none have been as frustrating as these!! After closing them you can kiss them good bye because you will NEVER be able to open them again! At first I thought it was just 1 faulty cup and tried the second from a 2 pack....same result! Do not buy these!
5,Exactly what I thought it was going to be,The night light was exactly as explained and exactly what I expected. Very happy with how quick it was shipped out to me.
5,Just what I needed.,This item arrived in very good time exactly as described. The amount of research it represents is staggering. Perfect for my collection.
5,Awesome Buy,"This pan is exactly as it is described. It is heavy-duty and the strainer makes this a wonderful pan to own and use. I highly suggest buying it. Having that added strainer in the lid saves space because you don't need a separate strainer. The pan itself is good quality, not flimsy at all and will last a long time."
4,"Great straining and cooking, VERY heavy","This pot is great for making vegetables and other items you may need to strain. Because it is a high walled pot it doesn't allow much if any splatter onto your cooking surface. This is particulary handy with the smoothtop stoves. It has 2 spouts as another reviewer mentioned which is great for both righties and lefties. However, a word of caution: This pot is indeed very heavy. So for someone who has trouble with heavy items, possibly disabled or eldery or just has difficuties with heavy things - this pot will be a problem to use. Also, because of the higher walls it may also not set well in some dishwashers if you choose to clean it that way. It does come clean quite well though in the dishwasher, maybe not so much with the new phosphate-free crud soaps though. Overall this has been a very handy pot and is used several times a week in our house."
5,3.5 quart Anolon Nonstick pan.pan,"Finally! An anodized pan that is truly nonstick. I am SO enjoying this pan.Really love the straining lid which works so well, and saves me having to usea colander every time I drain veggies, noodles, potatoes or mac'n'cheese.I plan to purchase an entire set for my daughter."
4,"Satisfied, Good product","Was considering this vs. the similar Calphalon model - when I looked at the products in the local Macy's, the Calphalon model had a lot of scratches along the inside rim due to the lid fitting very tightly. The lid on the Anolon fits well, but not so snugly as to cause similar scratching. The pot is not too heavy, and I like the silicone on the lid and handles. I already dropped the lid on the tiled kitchen floor and it didn't break. Also, it seems to conduct heat very well because boiling water for pasta takes less time than with my previous cheapo non-stick pot."
1,Great PAN Amazon doesn't have any that aren't damaged though,"I ordered this pan and had to argue about a ""mysterious"" price change. Then finally received the pan which had a damaged lid. I called sent back the damaged one and just received my new one and it also has a damaged lid. They offered me nothing as far as compensation and I have now cancelled this transaction.They suck"
5,you can't beat anolon,"I purchased this pan to expand a set. The size is perfect when cooking for a family, and the strainer lid makes it one of my favorite pans for veggies. It is a bit heavy, but it is made to last. I have owned a set of anolon for almost 14 years now and only just recently has it shown signs of wear and tear after daily use."
3,"Nice pot, loose lid","I really like this pot, except for the fact that the lid does not fit tightly. The straining feature is nice both for straining and for letting steam escape when needed.The only negative thing is that the pan is rather heavy when full, but that is to be expected with quality cookware."
5,A very helpful and useful book,"I think this book is very good for the people who start learning Unix/Linux programming. It explains things clearly. It is useful for people use it as reference, too."
1,Zero Substance,"After reading this book (I do not bother reading even a half), many would be thrilled that they now has ten times of stuff about mathematics to talk about on a coffe table, but they should also realize that they know exactly as much mathematics as they had before."
3,"Silverware is nice, but rusts easily","This silverware is nice, very heavy weight, handcrafted and EXPENSIVE. But it rusted the first time I didn't wash and dry it IMMEDIATELY after use. I will be returning this for something else most likely."
5,best stainless flatware,"I've used this flatware for 6 years and I'm completely happy with it. When a few pieces of my original set went missing, I was worried that the pattern might be retired and I would have to switch. I was really happy to find that exotique is still being sold, so I bought a few extra settings to keep around in case we have company. If you like heavy, high quality flatware, you should consider this set."
2,Ol' Rusty,"I purchased two sets of this pattern for a little over 6 months ago. Whithin a month of using and washing them in the dishwasher, several pieces showed dark discolorations on the burnished handles. Those discolorations have become rusty specs on about 75% of all the utensils. They always appear dirty.What a shame! I bought this to replace a set of flatware I bought 36 years ago for my first apartment. That cheap flatware (I think I paid around $20.00 for service for 8) STILL looks MUCH better that this new, expensive, heavy weight 18/10 stainless!"
4,A Good Choice,I bought this video along with the CPR video because I plan on doing some day care in my home and wanted to brush up on my skills. I have taken First Aid and CPR courses in the past but had forgotten a lot of things. The video was very helpful and covered many things. I had my two daughters watch the videos with me as they plan on starting to babysit soon and they thought it was very helpful. I would recommend this video to everyone.
5,outstanding and informative,This video is a must! As a teacher and working with children daily this video is a lifesaver. One cannot be too prepared in case of an emergency and this video gives the foundation for unforseen situations and how to react correctly. I highly recommend this as a must have in your video library.
5,Just What We Were Looking For,"We have been looking online for all the features we wanted in a gate. This was exactly what we wanted. It blocks the front door and then if we want to just block the starts it will swing and adjust for that area. If we want to move it out of the way, it is just as easy."
2,Not really what I was looking for,"I returned this item soon after I purchased it. I was excited that it expands without having to buy the extra pieces other gates would require for my large opening. This just didn't work out. It's too big. I don't know that it's fait to give it only 2 stars just because it didn't work for me, so if you're looking for a gate that expands pretty much the entire distance it says it does, then this may work for you. If not, it's too bulky to use for anything smaller."
4,It is hard...but good!,"It does the job, but as previously commented by others it is hard to close. But I think it just takes practice so if you have the patience, I think this does the job! The product is of high quality so you shouldn't have to worry about breakage too easily."
4,Good Dog Gate,"Gate was relatively easy to install, took about 20 minutes. You do need to put screws in your wall and it's permanent but the gate folds into itself so that you can easily open it and move it out of the way if you're not using it. I have three little dogs and it keeps them in."
4,I like it,Great fit for wide staircases.Use it all the time......keeps the little ones safe.Nice to have a permanent gate that doesn't buckle when shook back and forth by toddler.Need to make sure both top and bottom latch in.Took just two practices to get the hang of it.
1,Returned ours,"I had my husband put this up- we needed to add our own 1 x 4 wood to screw in the gate to the wall- their screws are lame so we used our own wood screws too-only to find this gate is way too hard to open/close. We took it down and returned it. This was for a kitchen entrance where there is high traffic, and each time we go through this gate, we had to be very patient, for it is wobbly and you need to latch it shut - have it aligned just right and it is soooo frustrating! The sliding door sticks and gets stuck every time so you need to push and pull to get it to slide open or shut.Once you can get it to slide open, it swings out which is great, but don't waste your time and money!"
4,Supergate is just that Super,I purchased this gate to keep my new puppy in the kitchen. I have a large opening between my kitchen and living room and this gate fit wonderfully. It was very easy to install and there was no assembling required. I would recommend this item to anyone with pets or small children. I also have a two year old and it works on him also. The ease of opening and closing is wonderful. This item was priced very reasonable.
2,gate part cracked,"The gate had cracks in the wall mounts and the gate doesnt glide with ease. Tried contacting the company, waste of time."
2,Not worth it!,"The gate is extremely hard to open and close, sliding the sections back and forth is almost impossible unless you are a very strong person. The locking/latch system is not workable without a lot of time and trouble. The whole gate is not designed to be user-friendly."
2,We returned ours...,"It arrived fast, (we have Prime and LOVE IT), and when I took it out of the box, I was a little turned off by it. The thing is ugly. It's just a lot of plastic, everywhere. I knew it was plastic, but once I saw it, I just wasn't impressed. I gave it a chance anyway, because we have odd doorways which are wider than most so I wanted to see how it would work. It's clunky. It's a pain to open and close. It wobbles back and forth and if you have little ones, it could potentially pinch or catch their fingers. Plus, it seemed a bit difficult for our 6 year old to operate. It would make a great pet gate, we just don't think it's a great kid gate."
5,Great Pet Gate,Bought 2 of these gates to restrict the our dogs to certain areas of the house and they work just great. I didn't want to put holes in the walls by installing the hardware so we just open the gates wide enough to block off the door ways by leaning them against the door frame. These gates work great and are easy to use.
5,im so happy i got this,i can now keep my kids out of the kitchen with out yelling at them and moving them all the time! the kids hate it but im so happy with it
3,Great in Theory - not in Practice,"The gate is heavy. My wall couldn't support it so I recommend using anchors/studs/whatever it takes.Then, I recommend oiling or greasing the gate because it isn't very slick to slide back and forth.Also, the directions don't factor in wood trim when mounting the brackets. The presence of trim or moulding make it challenging to install.All in all, I returned it and opted for a pressure mount gate for my dog. The headache (and now replacing the ripped out drywall) just wasn't worth it."
4,Great for pets & kids,"I would have given this 5 stars, but it is a pain to try to retract/slide the gate width after opening it. Other than that, it works wonderful for keeping my 11 month old son out of the laundry room where the dogfood is, and keeps my 4 Labrador Retrievers out of the house when company is over. It is tall enough to keep one of my dogs from jumping over the top of it. I'm 5'3"" and can step over it with minimal difficulty."
4,Good gate for price,"Just recieved this gate today. Put it up in a matter of minutes. You will need a drill or electric screwdriver, because I tried to put it up by a hand screw driver and it takes forever(but not impossible.) It isn't the best gate out there by far but it serves it purpose and is a good value for the price. I definitely would order another one if I needed a gate to fit a large opening. Yes it does stick a little and it is somewhat difficult to close with one hand. But again it IMO isn't so horrible that I would return it."
4,Great Value for a large opening.,"I have two small dogs and a 6 ft opening from the kitchen to the living/dining room/front hall. I did not want to spend $100 plus on a gate. It must be improved recently because I did not find any of the problems mentioned in other reviews. My husband had no problems installing it, granted he is an engineer. It moves smoothly and I have no problem unlatching it with one hand while holding a wiggling puppy in the other. It does the job and did not cost me much. If it is not as attractive as a wooden gate, so be it."
3,"Quiet, but auto mode doesn't seem to work well","After three weeks of operation, I took the cover off to clean the pre-filter, expecting that there would be a significant amount of dust. I was surprise to see that there was almost nothing on the filter. After running my previous air cleaner for three weeks, there would be enough dust to vacuum. It seems the problem is the auto mode. It always seems to keep the device on low, which pulls in and puts out very little air. I've switched it to manual mode and am running it on medium now, which defeats the purpose of the auto modes (which probably elicit the rather hefty price tag). One other note--this may not be the best device for a bedroom, at least if it's placed in viewing sight. Even though the lights dim in auto night mode, they don't dim that much, and there are a lot of lighted items on the control panel. It would make more sense if it just went dark during night mode."
2,Conked Out After 1 Year,"I bought this air cleaner about a year ago. When I first got it I was so impressed. It made the air smell so clean. When I noticed that it wasn't working so well I called Winix. I was told that I probably needed to change the filter pack (NOT CHEAP BY THE WAY). After changing the filter it's still not cleaning the air like it was when new. In theory changing the filters should restore all function. Winix seems reluctant to do anything as they tell me ""We've never had one fail."" All I can say is there's always a first time. So now I paid all this money for this air cleaner and it's not doing any more than a $79 unit."
3,"Moved air, but didn't notice a difference in air quality","I used this purifier for about 20 days before returning it.When it arrived the charcoal filter was not packaged in sealed plastic so it had ""leaked"" charcoal all over the purifier. I believe it was supposed to come sealed which leads me to believe it was previously used and returned.The purifier itself seemed to move a decent amount of air. However the primary reason I purchased it was to help remove odors from the air, specifically cigarette smoke. I don't believe it helped with that. It may work well for cleaning the air but did not work well for removing odor."
3,Air Cleaner,"It looks nice and is relatively light weight, but it has not significantly changed the air quality in the room it was placed. Maybe it takes a while to be effective. I will wait on judgement and remark after a longer period of usage."
5,Max Von Sydow & Ingmar Bergman at Their Best.,"This is the only foreign movie to win an Academy Award. Its in stark black and white during Medieval times. Lots of Pagan imagery.Max comes across as the Norse god Odin full of vengeance. He'sdown right scary when he goes after the 3 who raped and murdered his beautiful daughter.You won't be able to take your eyes off that scene, or the rest of the movie for that matter.This movie is an A+"
5,Thanks!,"My uncle was not really in to foreign films, but after a discussion regarding ""Last House on The Left"" I told him about this movie and sent it to him. When we last talked, he had already watched it 3 times even though he does not dig on subtitles and then raved about the special features. He said movie was in mint condition. Thanks again!"
4,A tragedy and a spiritual renewal?,I'm certainly glad this was better than his opera.The rape and murder witnessed by a servant girl is revenged.The result is much harder for the survivors than the victims and criminals?The point seems to be a religious legend from the middle ages.
3,another fine work of Ingmar Bergman,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.The Virgin Spring, known its native Sweden as ""Jungfrukällan"" is the story of a Christian family in medieval Sweden. One day their daughter is raped and murdered on her way to church by pagans. The enraged father then seeks revenge on her killers.The film's rape scene was cut from the original American release and has been included here for the first time in a official American release.The DVD special features include an introduction to the film by director Ang Lee, interviews with actresses, Gunnel Lindblom and Birgitta Pettersson, and an audio commentary by Bergman scholar, Birgitta Steene."
5,Awesome,The quality is fantastic and it contains all of the great highlights of Big Blue's win. It is so much better than the SB XLII one because it is now in high def. Here's hoping they put together a road to the super bowl set with all the playoff games.
5,GREAT,This video is an excellent representation of the GIANTS season. Everyone should own this!! Really nicely down. A+++Highly recommend.
2,not really what I wanted.,I wanted a CD which showed the entire Super Bowl XLVI.This CD is snippets of the season and the Super Bowl. Not what I wanted.J
2,Does not deliver,The title states Super Bowl XLVI I foolishly assumed it would be a replay of the entire Super Bowl.I wish I had read the reviews because the product did not deliver.I was out of the country and missed seeing the game and then paid for a highlight film.Contemplating sending it back to Amazon.
1,Not worth it - Junk for Giants' fans,"This video is a highlight film - not a complete video of the Super Bowl.I have a copy of the fabulous IVII Giants Super Bowl video. It has all the playoff games, in their entirety. This doesn't even have the Super Bowl in its entirety.This video should clearly state it is a ""highlight film"".Then produce a complete video as in the past. I did like the highlights of the games during the season. The change I would suggest is limiting the length of early less significant games and longer length key games.I would buy the second longer video, regardless of price. I would not buy the ""highlight"" version."
4,Agreed,I am also going to wait until they release the blu ray that has all the playoff games on them. I still have the super bowl on my dvr. BTW can I also add that Joe Buck calling the game in 07 was way better then Al Micheals in 2011 season. On the hail mary he does not sound excited at all the ball dropped. Joe Buck makes the plax touchdown in 07 sound great.
3,Big Blue Diehard...,"Being my team looks to slip further into mediocrity, the TWO SUPER BOWL VICTORIES in the space of 5 years may be all I have to enjoy for Seasons to come...Haters gonna hate, but I always love my Giants !!!"
5,Nfl Super Bowl xlvi champions: 2011 New York giants,This was a gift for my grandson. He loved it. Every time I see him he has it in his hand or is playing it. Guess that would make it five stars plus.
4,Giants season review,This season review has coverage of every game the Giants played in their 2011/12 season. Unfortunately because their regular season form was so patchy the producers have decided to try and skate over some of the defeats by just showing Giants touchdowns without mentioning the scores in the games at the time the TD's occurred. This kills any suspense or tension because you have no idea how significant the touchdown was in the course of the game. Fortunately once you get to the important end of season games and playoffs the coverage is better and you're always aware of what the score is when a significant play occurs adding to the enjoyment. Overall this is a good DVD with lots of footage but it's not as good as previous season reviews I've purchased.
1,NY Giants SuperBowl XLVI Champions,"I must say this DVD was a disappointment for the following reasons. First, they preview superbowl XLII - an unnecessary addition AND What they left out was a post game show with interviews (from both teams) -- a feature many football fans enjoy. The only postgame feature they had was the ceremony...NOT the best. The rest include conversations with Manning, the receiving corp and David Tyree. Personally, I look for the post game analysis as the most interesting. In addition, the physical nature of the Game with San Francisco was one of the best -- that was omitted. Frankly, I'd save my money and do some searches on the interview to see game highlights and post-game interviews -- you'd get more from it. Can't understand why the post-game stuff would have been left off...Perhaps to get you to buy another DVD????"
5,Great great stuff,"This is my 6th or 7th Trojan box set. They are pretty uniformly awesome, in my opinion. Rare Groove may be one of my favorites thus far. As far as a previous reviewer stating that there's only ""one good tune"" on disc one - completely wrong. It's probably my favorite disc in the set. But everyone's tastes are different.If you like early reggae, this set is for you. Really nice, bouncy early stuff from the late 60s into more ""serious"" early 70s grooves. Just all-around excellent tunes. A lot of this stuff is similar to disc one of the Upsetter box set - apolitical and upbeat, with a heavy debt to 60s R&B; - but all that in a good way."
5,Don't Sleep on this!,"If you like PUTS, TRES, or older stuff like Tribe, Pharcyde, Digable Planets, etc then you will like this. It's worth the price just for the song ""Dumbin Out"" (a remake of Tribe's 'Buggin Out') alone!The album plays out kinda like De La Soul's ""De La Soul is Dead"" album where you feel like your listening to a radio station that plays nothin but the good ish all day.I just heard of these cats on Pandora, and since then I keep this on rotation, it's just dope music! Highly Recommend for people that like cool hip hop."
3,fundamentally dope hip hop,"time machine should be compared to the feel good greats like de la soul, a tribe called quest and jungle brothers. This is the best buy of the decade. Listen,learn and teach sound hip hop."
4,Well done,"True, at 21 he may have limitations on his poetic skills - but that's expected at his age. Despite, he manages to reveal his emotions on an effective level, showing that he does have potential (and a future as a poet)! I love the personal touch of the book, I feel as though you really get a chance to know the author through his works and the book leaves you anticipating volumes 2,3,4 etc."
1,not quite as PROFOUND as some say,"while author mark anthony thomas shows his skill as a poet, he does so in a rather limited capacity. i would rather he choose one theme and develop it instead of this incessant rambling that fills up most of the book. take the time to develop this before your next publication."
2,Lackluster,"This collection of poems is both sporadic and random. Mark Anthony Thomas does have some good work that is mixed in with a lot of crap. It is very hard to find a theme anywhere in this work. Much of the writings are very self serving and fail to let us see any flaw that might exist in the author. This leads me to believe that he is either not human, or just giving us slanted view into his soul. Thomas is just a victim of the weepy rhetoric that defines so much of generation Y."
4,Academic Look at Campaigns,"Not a bad book. Thurber presents American campaigns from an academic perspective in describing how they operate and how they have changed over time.This is less of a practical or ""how to"" book than a descriptive treatise on campaign practices. It is valuable in introducing the reader to the why's and hows of modern campaigning in America. A person who is looking for a guide to organizing their own run for local office will find this book interesting, but will want to supplement it with one of the many more practical books on the subject...I'm teaching a course in elective politics at the University of Pennsylvania's Fels Center of Government. This is one of the required reading books for the course and is also used by some other teachers in the field at colleges and universities around the country."
4,Good overview about American campaigns,"This is a pretty fair treatment of what makes American campaigns unique. It highlights the need to master the media, fundraising, and the technology centered nature of campaigns that emerges from the week state of the parties. Basically, this book offers up an image of what happens when elections are conducted in a weak party system. You get the American system, and this book also offers up a sense of how that impacts the quality of representation one receives. It is a good book, but offers only improvements to what we already knew, with the added bonus that the writing is a little too technical. Anyway, a good book for a scholar, but few others."
4,Nice Text Book!,I'm a graduate student from Taiwan. I study in Graduate Institute of American Studies of Tamkang University. My professor wants each of us to have this book and read it closely. Although I haven't got the book yet. But according to my professor's recommendation. I think this should be a very good book to understand how election won.
5,Great Reference,"Have been an apprentice electrician and worked in the field. When in a classroom, this book is great for refreshing your memory on a formula or to get the right formula for making the correct bend in a piece of conduit. No matter how experienced one is, it is always nice to have a small reference item such as this book. I know several Master Electricians that swear by this book."
3,"great color, but paper is thin and ""wrinkly""","When I needed some 8.5"" x 11"" photo paper and this was my only option at a local store, I bought it. On my 6-year-old Canon i960 photo printer, it printed beautifully, with great depth of color, contrast, sharpness, etc. Stunning, truly, given the price point! The print quality is worthy of framing, but the paper quality isn't... the paper is so thin (6.5 mils compared to 8.5 mils for the premium and 10 mils for ultra premium), that it gets ""waves"" of large wrinkles from full-color prints. The wrinkles do not disappear when the paper dries, and it is still visible (from the side) if the prints are matted and framed.I would strongly recommend getting the thicker papers if you are planning to frame or otherwise display the photos. If you are dry-mounting them to foam core or some other solid surface with an adhesive spray, this paper will be fine."
3,Misleading description.,"Item claims to have a reflective gold layer. Gold layer cds are supposed to have more resilience to heat and other elements that degrade cd-r s over time. Once rec'd I saw no evidence of the gold layer and questioned seller. Seller replied, checked and confirmed there was no gold reflective layer and would have add corrected. To date this has not happened. They work well enough for the price but are not what is being advertised."
5,Wish I had known sooner,"Growing up in a family that loved jazz in the town where Glenn Miller's wife was living when he died in WW II, big band swing music was a near constant. I remembered hearing 1938-9 Benny Goodman 12 minute version of Sing-Sing-Sing on vinyl and the pleasure of finally getting it on CD (I currently have 2 copies of the full concert, plus 2 more in compilations). I also remember wondering why the concert was listed for both '38 and '39. Now I know that is was only a part of a series of concerts acknowledging the awesome musical contributions by African-Americans. All 3 discs have lived up to the standard of the Goodman recordings albeit with totally different music, styles and performers. Even if your taste is Rock and Roll, knowing the roots of the only ""American"" music that stands toe to toe with other classics is a must. And this collection is fine means to learn it."
5,"Super savings on patterns for 18"" dolls.","Patterns range from simple to detailed and can be successfully used by novices to accomplished seamstresses. Combinations of patterns are almost endless. The cost of the entire collection of patterns was less than what one could expect to pay for just ONE item of the brand-name pre-made clothing. This is the second book of patterns I have purchased and both times I've been very satisfied with the cost, the fast and reasonable shipping and the quality of this product."
5,Great pattern book,Simple and easy to follow with great patterns that my girls both want to sew and their dolls look cute in.
5,A Favorite,"I have been collecting Joan Hinds' books since her first book. In this book I love the the attention to detail in such pieces as the Jean Jacket and the Hooded Sweat Shirt. They look exactly like tiny versions of children's garments. She adds to the fun of the book by including a variety of accessories. I love all of her books, but this is one of my favorites."
3,I wish....,I had borrowed this book from the library and loved the patterns so much I decided to buy the book. The only problem is that they changed the patterns to that tissue paper - like other patterns and the one at the library had nice sturdy pattern pieces. Wish they had kept it that way. YET the patterns are easy to use.
3,patterns,this outfits are out of date and are old fashioned. they need to come out with more fashionable patterns for today's world.
3,Good Guideline,"Not totally happy with either of her books. My husband gifted me ""Today's Fashion"" by Joan Hinds. Difficult to get on American Girl doll so change closers. Hats need to be a precise fit and are not. If I didn't have many years of experience I am not sure what the end result would be. I to love the ideas provided with the patterns."
3,okay,Cute ideas but too many hard to find items needed to complete (such as zippers). Crochet instructions hard for me to follow
2,Disappointed,"I am a good sewist and thought I'd give making doll clothes a try. I borrowed this book from the library, carefully traced out a few patterns and, four attempts later, have tops too large for the skirts, sleeves too large for the armholes, etc. I'm stumped. I'm following the instructions carefully, also. Like a previous reviewer, I've also noticed errors in the instructions. I'm ready to try another author or pattern maker."
3,Great for Ideas,"This book was great for ideas and general instructions. However, I found the patterns to be way too large for the 18"" dolls, and I found several errors in the construction directions. As a seasoned sewist, I knew how to work around this misdirection, but newer sewists may not.I can still recommend the book though just for the inspiration."
2,Doll clothes,"I just made the sleeveless party dress and the pieces don't match up properly. Because the scale is so small, it is really difficult to fudge a difference of as little as 1/4"". The directions are clear, but the patterns are flawed."
5,book,I really like this book. The patterns are easy to follow. I have made lots of items from this book and they have all turned out great.
3,Great insturctios.,"I have sewn for dolls for many years, and the instructions and tips really help make this pattern book a must have."
4,THIS VIDEO HAS THE BEST VIDEOCLIP I'VE EVER SEEN...,"the video of ""flesh&blood(sacrifice)"" is incredible, is so cool to see bret michaels torturing a woman..."
4,Another excellent resource for continual improvement,"If you like ""Wheeler's Understanding Variation, the Key to Managing Chaos"", You should like this book. It is written for non-technical audiences, and describes approaches to looking at your data that allow you to separate signal from noise - The book is written in an almost conversational tone, with many every day examples, which help to reinforce that you can do SPC on just about any data, not just in manufacturing or in a laboratory.Lots of explanations of using count data, variables data, and proper ways of portraying your data (actually, the chapter called ""Graphical Purgatory"" shows some classic examples of how NOT to portray your data)The book is a bit pricier than some other texts, but I think it is well worth it."
2,"the really long, blue one warps easily","I know I'm not putting tension on my yarn because it almost falls off the loom, but my big, blue loom is seriously warped and I've only made about 18"" of knitting with it.... Plus, the set only comes with VERY basic instructions that are really only suitable for use on the smallest (red) loom and looks awful in the suggested worsted weight yarn (it's very loopy and would get caught on everything).This product might be better if 1. it came with more/better instructions and 2) didn't warp so quickly.If you're going to be making flat panels, stick with the round loom and read up on stitches that will lay flat. Going around the flat loom to make flat panels is a pain, it is difficult to work the inside of the loom."
5,"Vallee's research is profound, startling, and captivating.","In this book, Dr. Vallee puts forth massive evidence in support of a hypothesis he first formulated thirty years ago--that UFOs may not be from outer space, but interdimensional, able to enter our world at anytime they choose. And contrary to what most extraterrestrial-hypothesis proponents claim, Vallee's evidence is extremely persuasive. In fact, upon reading the book, one realizes that the UFO phenomenon represents something infinitely more profound and tantalizing than space visitors: It shows us that alien beings are not distant from us, separated by hundreds of lightyears, but here, with us, now--as indeed they always have been. We need only to open our minds to meet them. . . . --Thomas T. Huston"
2,A hard act to swollow,"Mr Vallee does an analysis of UFO sighting throughout the ages from Biblical times to the present, relying heavily of folk and fairy tales to formulate his own theory on the nature of UFO's. This book is very new age orientated. Vallee provides no real fresh insight into the UFO phenomena. He merely replaces old fairy tales with one of his own. A book that is hard to recommend."
2,"Interesting, but insubstantial","Dimensions: A Casebook of Alien Contact provides dozens of fascinating stories and provocative questions. Yet most of the questions are reiterations of one another, and none of it is backed up by substantial analysis or evidence. I don't mean to say that such analysis or evidence could not exist--just that it isn't in this book. The author seems to think he is performing science when instead he is telling stories, and the result fails to be a very good example of either."
4,st anthony,I respect the authors true wish to search for the truth and not the thin surface film which disguises is as most others do and dont see the danger of such an approach.I would like to comment on the paragraph of st anthonys supposed contact with a being which was neither an angel nor a demon.If you read all of saint anthonys works and his life as written by his disciple st Athanasius you will see that demonic apparitions and attacks occured throughout his life in the desert and were always treated as such.demons.this so called encounter totally contradicts st Anthonys reaction to all such phenomena of which the described creature is clearly a demon.an ascetic living all his life in the darkest deserted places on earth and constantly at war with the forces of evil would never ever react in such a superficial acceptance of the story of a goat legged creature.clearly a demon.this is fabricated blasphemy of the truth created by someone who opposes the truth many centuries ago.
3,Nothing new here,"There is nothing new presented in this book. Every theory has been articulated by authors well before this volume came out - that said, there are a number of interesting stories to be found between the rather dry analysis of these mysteries. I find it interesting that the author was an astrophysicist that was ""pulled"" into the UFO phenomenon after watching a group of people destroy evidence of unexplained tracks from an observatory.Really though, I cannot buy into the theory that the Celtic legends of ""little people"" and modern day extra-terrestrials are one in the same. The descriptions and behaviors do not match. I think the author goes too far in the assumption and draws conclusions that are not valid.This is not a book for my book shelf, but I will donate it to the local library."
2,Monroe Shocks are made in the USA not China,"This vendor sent a set of shocks stamped ""Made in China"". I think the vendor sold Chinese made look-a-like goods. Also, they do not seem to support the front end of the Ram 1500 well."
5,Good truck shock for highway and towing,These work well on a truck for highway and towing. Stiffer than your average shock but not harsh. The valving provides a decent ride but are plenty responsponsive for trailer towing with a 24 foot gooseneck. Not sure I'd use them on off-roading or trail vehicles though.
2,Not really required if you have a digital camera,If you have a digital camera and have any one of many photo correction softwares then you really dont need these filters.
3,School text (required),"The one class for Spanish I am taking required this text. So far the book is appropriate and is proving useful for my continuing study of the language - speaking, reading and listening comprehension."
2,OK?????,"Yeah, ok first thing i gotta say is. HAHAHAHAHA. First review made me laugh. Umm...ok next, whoever sang this didn't pick the artist very well. I know Christina is a great singer and all, but the person who sings the songs on this album, their voice is too low! girl whoever you are, you should have done a tribute to cher or toni braxton or sumthin. seriously, and your voice is too country, the songs sound messed up. don't buy this album!"
1,one star is too much for this disc,"This is so horrible. I can't believe they even make this. The girl singing is not Christina, not only that but her voice is terrible. She can't even pronounce the words correctly. this is definatley not worth your money. Well, atleast they got the instrumental part right. It's just the vocal that was horrible. This is not a tribute. This is plain [poor]. Christina should sue these ppl.If you want a good laugh then yeah i guess this disc is for you.I spent the whole time laughing while listening to the disc. Stay away from it. Terrible! Terrible!"
5,My all-time favorite!,"We originally received this one as a baby gift for our first child and immediately claimed it as our favorite! My kids love to think about what momma animals ""think"" about their babies, and the fact that the rhymes go with familiar childhood melodies makes it easy to read. After reading the book so many times, we actually FORGOT the REAL words to the tunes. But we were happy with that!"
2,As if children can have love from only one parent at a time,"Sure, it's a nice book, but it's yet another one that tells children that love and security comes only from mothers. No matter the species--ducks, bunnies, bears, etc--fathers are nowhere to be found. Are we making the world a better place for the next generation by implying to them over and over in children's literature that absent or irrelevant fathers is a universal law of nature?Go ahead and read them this book, but dare to switch the genders around every now and then. Daddies sometimes even wear aprons, so don't let the sexist pictures in most children's books stop you."
3,"Adequate, but not inspired volume","Shows its age. Useful photos, color fidelity questionable. Unless you are studying the Book of Durrow in particular, get the Book of Kells CD-ROM in which each page is totally zoomable and it is well indexed."
1,This album is a total waste of money,"I bought this album as I needed some MP3 tracks for a non iPod player. It is rather like Podunk Middle School sings Ella Fitzgerald favorites. The song titles are correct and the music is vaguely recognizable as Who material, but the voice and energy are completely missing. This album should be coming to an elevator near you, don't waste your money."
5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!,I am planning my wedding and I bought this CD to help me with my music selection. Every song I could think of that I liked for a wedding was on this one CD. I love it!
3,Beautiful but HUGE,"This ring was so beautiful. This ring was a MONSTER sitting on my finger. Sent it back. 5 STARS to the company for IMMEDIATE refund. They were wonderful. Would absolutely purchase from them again, without hesitation. I will read the DESCRIPTION better next time!"
3,A history of the betrayal of emancipation's hopes.,"This is an out-dated history of the post Civil War efforts to stifle black Americans' entry into full citizenship. It ends in the early 1960's before the Freedom Riders, the Civil Rights Law of 1964, and the push by Americans of all races to ensure equality for all. It is a well written book that explains the history of Jin Crow laws. On reading this I was struck by how segregated the Northern states were; the people of these states were no more welcoming of black Americans in their neighborhoods, schools, and places of work. Segregation was not confined to the Old Confederacy but was practiced throughout the United States. This is certainly a book worth reading for those interested in the stifling of black equality and the early years of what is now called ""The Civil Rights Movement."""
3,Ho-Hum,"When I got this movie, I was really expecting a bit more, but I was rather dissapointed. The visuals and cinematography were OK, but nothing even remotely close to the best of UFA products. The movie gives a reasonably accurate rendition of the first half of the Niebelungenlied, the national medaeival epic of the Germans, up to Siegfried's death, and to that end is a reasonably good effort, but the movie was really fairly dull I thought, and for a silent expressionist effort, more attention should have been paid to the cinematography."
5,Bravo!,"If you are looking for information on what was going on around Vienna during Mozart's life time, then this book is for you. In between Mozart's two stays in Vienna, the author excerpts, (from an earlier publication of the times), a near complete listing of minute details of Vienese life. Fashions, wages, religious happenings, crime and punishment, the different people living in the city, the pubs, coffeehouses, and so much more. Great book to have in your Mozart collection for reference. I learned a lot. At these prices, you can't lose!"
5,Paul Whiteman & 1920's/early 30's Fans Will Really Like This,"The SFSO's CD's are always top quality in every way. They authentically recreate the sound of the 16 member (or so) bands of the latter 20's and early 30's. Their selections reflect the ""sweet jazz"" with ""hot jazz"" interludes in virtually every number.If you are a fan of Paul Whiteman, early Duke Ellington, McKinney's Cotton Pickers, you'll enjoy this one.Ed Rosenback's ""Bing-like"" laid back vocals, plus the vocals of Bob Schultz and Janine Marie complement the orchestration. The numbers were arranged to allow plenty of room for improvised solo interludes, showing off Bob Schultz's hot cornet--but really all the instruments seem to have a turn at bat and none strike out!Songs include: Shaking the Blues Away, Your Getting to Be A Habit with Me, You Took Advantage of Me, The Varsity Drag, and When You're Counting the Stars Alone.Definitely one of my personal top 10."
3,Reverse the Curse?,"Who knew serial murder could be laugh out loud funny? Ferrell has captured the desperation of Red Sox Nation in this sharp satire.A phenomanal rookie pitcher, who can hit like hell and play a mean right field, might just be what will push the also-ran Red Sox into the Championship, but ritualized murder follows the team like a rabid fan. The ownership, the management, the cops, everyone seems to be in on keeping what might be the ugliest secret ever in baseball to allow the Sox to reach the World Series and maybe even win it for a change.Suspense, not mystery, is what this book is, but the red herrings were too easily tossed aside and potential red herrings fizzled out as well. Ferrell manages to keep things mixed up enough to be a set-up guy, though not a starter or closer. Still, it was an entertaining book that kept me turning the pages because, like in baseball, anything could happen, and frequently enough did."
4,Not a Home Run,"This wasn't a bad mystery but was a bit dragged out and and predictable. Being an avid Red Sox fan, it would have been much more enjoyable for beheadings to center around the Yankees. It was interesting because you got to see baseball from the perpective of a general manager, an owner and by the manager. Wasn't a terrible read but not a sit on the edge of your seat thriller."
2,I can't decide what's worse.,"Ok, the storyline for the book was very enticing to me. I had high hopes - being a big baseball fan, and a fan of boths ports books and muder myster. Seems like the ultimate combo. Right? Wrong. My biggest issue - There was only one person in the entire book even remotely likeable. And he was constantly abused on a grand scale. So you're left feeling sorry for the hero the entire time, and trying to decide what you want to happen more - See the Red Sox win the World Series, or the idiots running the team get their just due.In the end, I just came away frustrated witht he whole thing."
2,unimpressive translation of one of the greatest novels ever,"I taught this novel in my French Lit class this week. I was terribly disappointed by this translation, which is British, and very old. My students, for the most part well-read graduate students, didn't get the novel at all. This shoddy and dated translation does not grasp the lyricism, the poetry, the imagination and the easy flow of Alain-Fournier's prose. There are many better translations. I fear this one was chosen because it was easiest to get a hold of, probably because the publishers didn't have to pay a fee. I find this to be a shameful sign of the direction publishing is taking these days. LE GRAND MEAULNES is truly one of the greatest novels of the 20th Century."
5,Haunting and Evocative Description of Lost Time,"Le Grand Meaulnes is a masterpiece of storytelling. I felt as if I were discovering the central mysteries of the book as they unfolded for the narrator. The descriptive passages were beautifully written, and my feeling after having finished the book is as haunting as its ending."
3,"Vintage Sabu, in black and white.","For Sabu fans. Savage Drums is a bit of a pot boiler, but contains some rare footage of a Boeing Stratocruiser. Worth it for that, if you're an aviation buff. Jungle Hell is more interesting. It could easily be a sequel to his first pre-war film ""Elephant Boy"". Looks like the same India location, the same river, almost the same herds of Elephants (now with their tusks clipped) and Sabu's in the same dhoti style shorts running through the same forested territory. Compare the two films and enjoy! The man was ageless in many ways. Buy it! If you like Sabu! Jungle Hell does appear to have been heavily edited for this DVD, apparently made for TV use. Original reviews contain references to a ""flying saucer"", a popular subject at the time, but it's not in this version. It won't be missed. Sabu is the star for sure. Excellent transfers."
5,great value for the money,these knives are a bargain ! I personally change the one i carry in my pocket every month or so.
3,you get what you pay for.,"these knives are about what you expect. most are very cheaply made, plastic handles, loose mechanisms, low-quality blades. about half are non-serrated, the other half half-serrated. there are a couple with metal handles, but notice that most are UGLY. that big blue one you see in the picture? i wouldn't be caught dead carrying that sucker. there are a couple that were very light, very sharp, and easy to open & close oen-handed.HOWEVER, i'm a firm believer in throw-away knives. i hate to use my nice SOG/gerber/benchmade for pry jobs, or cutting wire, etc. if i trash one of these babies, or i get in a situation where i need to throw it away, i dont feel bad.in short, don't expect quality stuff. you could get these at a swap meet for a few bucks apiece. but 15 knives for $20 isn't a bad deal, no matter how you slice it."
2,Cheap,"These knives are cheap as mentioned in the other reviews. I used one to cut open a plastic container and the back of the knife broke when i was cutting it. It's kind of a joke how non durable these knives are.The locking feature for most of the knives sticks, so trying to get the knives close can be a hastle.One pro is that these knives are very cheap and there is no feeling bad if you loose it or throw it away. They do have sharp blades on most of them, but i'm not sure how quick they wear down or break. Good for dirty jobs that you don't want to get a $50 knife messed up. Just make sure to bring more than one incase one breaks."
2,Probably my last Elaine Flinn book,"I too really enjoyed the first two books in this series and was saving this installment as one I was sure to love. But I had to skim the last 100 or so pages because I knew how it was going to turn out and the dialog wasn't fun or enjoyable to me. It may be true that Randall and Emma are true to life, but they're just not people I wanted to spend anymore time with. It's too often that teasing is confused with bulling and I think that Randal in particular was abusive and domineering towards the end, with the excuse of he's the cop so it's Ok.Authority figures are tough to portray well, but authors can write characters as roll models. When there are those ideal authority figures, children can be children and that's very dimensional and rich. For Randal to be the love interest and not be nice to Molly is just un-excusable. And for Emma to be un-parented and friend to Molly is un-healthy."
4,a good entry in the series,I liked this one in Which Molly Agrees to evaluate an Estateand a body in a coffin is discovered in a hidden room.Interesting (if bitchy in a couple of instances)charactersand an intriguing plot line. re:some other reviewersobjection to an focus on & the addition of Molly's NeiceEmma I didn't have a problem with her.
5,Loves mysteries,I love this series and have enjoyed Emma coming into the book. The only thing I have to say is WRITE FASTER. I'm anxious for the next book!
4,Another great mystery from Elaine Flinn,"Elaine Flinn, one of today's best writers of traditional mysteries, returns this month with ""Deadly Collection,"" the latest installment in her charming series about Molly Doyle, an antiques dealer in Carmel, Calif.Molly is hired to auction the contents of a grand estate that once belonged to a pair of Hollywood set designers. She discovers that the house holds some dark secrets, including possible blackmail, kidnapping and even murder.As always, Flinn's sly wit, skillful plotting and gift for character raise her work above the norm."
5,"I want MORE, please...","I've been waiting a year for Elaine Flinn's third Molly Doyle mystery to come out - it was worth it! She just gets better and better with each book.Thanks for keeping your writing fresh, and making the plots a little more complex with each book. I love it. When's that 4th book coming out??And congratulations on winning the Barrie Award for Best Paperback Original for 2004! That's so damn cool! (for those who might not know it - these awards are voted on by the readers of Deadly Pleasures magazine...kinda like getting an Emmy!)"
4,One of the best local bands in the Bay Area!,"I've been listening to Blue House for several years now and they are truly one of the best local bands in the Bay Area. Their bluesy sound, meaningful lyrics and harmonic vocals make time stand still. For those willing to get off the beaten track, you will be graciously rewarded.Mario Castellon"
3,"Tyla ""Libertine""","A nice companion to his ""Life and Times of a Ballad Monger"".It has a band feel and it's Rock & Roll the real deal."
2,"DVD stinks, GREAT FILM!","YOUNG AT HEART is the perfect Doris Day vehicles. It has comedy, great songs,a handsome leading man and a touch of melodrama. Its an unforgettable picture if for no other reason than to catch a glimpse of the Day/Sinatra chemistry. Those who know this film surely love it. But let me continue with what a previous review stated...the DVD stinks.While the film elements are probably the best available, it would appear no work went into its mastering. There are some annoying (and distracting) twitches that go on throughout most of the film. These are undoubtedly a result of the poorly maintained film element. The soundtrack is serviceable, if a little too low. There are also no real extra features here (of course for a little over 10 bucks, one can't expect much). Artisan DVD should take a little better care of what they release on a technical level. (Not that the Republic Pictures vaults couldn't use better maintenance)."
2,Young at Heart,"The movie is a great movie, but my DVD that I purchased does not work right. It skips and messes up in some parts."
4,Excellent transaction,Glad to have been able to find this old movie that I loved. It was mailed quickly and efficiently and was just what I wanted.
3,Nice Kitsch!,"Sinatra plays a down and out composer/singer. Doris a perky gal with pizzazz. Gig Young plays what Gig Young plays! Robert Keith,Alan Hale jr. courts Dorothy Malone(y) and Ms. Barrymore steals every scene.Terrific songs and this film takes us to a place that we might know about but have forgotten about. A Folksy place where people still sat on front porches and were generally content.Lanny Rees fixes the plumbing."
3,Frankie sings the blues,"This movie seems to be an attempt to make a popular musical of anElvis type using Doris Day at her best as the lead female.The casting and music / songs are great,but setting this in an Eastern Ivy college town in the 50'swas a major mistake. The result compared to Frankie as trying to kill the president or as a hooked big city junky ( or one of his other 50's comeback films) is just too tame by comparison.Just too ""wholesome"" and all American white middle class:Frank Sinatra just doesn't fit into the picture at all?There are cigarettes but not a lot of alcohol, low girls,high times and New York streets here.The songs he does sing come off pretty good:I really enjoyed seeing Doris Day at her prime too."
3,"One of the best, I love this movie","This movie is absolutely one of my favorites. Frank Sinatra and Doris Day are absolutely great together, Barney Sloan and Laurie Tuttle! I agree that they should have made more movies together! The entire cast is phenomenol, even Ernie. The DVD visually was fantastic! I recommend it for those who can hear. I did rate this 3 stars because when I received the movie it had the Close Caption symbol on the back. As a hearing impaired person, I was then disappointed when there was no Close Caption even though the symbol indicated such. Amazon in no way misguided me, I ordered it not knowing if there was close caption for the Hearing impaired. I just think if it states in on the movie case, they should have it."
4,The ultimate bizarre '50s pairing.,"This film is as glossy and idealized as any Douglas Sirk film, but has the added bonus of two seasoned, albeit completely different former big band singers performing some wonderful songs, as well as a final killer duet. Day was just entering her perky virginal ultimate-shiksa era (a role she would hone in future films with Rock Hudson and James Garner) while Sinatra was morphing from the skinny earnest popular crooner he was in the '40s to the Rat Pack persona which dominated the rest of his life. The film itself is your standard '50s weeper, but the production values and costumes are pure, unadulterated American mid-century, which elevate it to a must-see period piece. Terrific."
3,Great Movie...Not so Great Quality.,"It is obvious that someone simply copied an old original. There were a few glitches throughout the movie, where the sound went dead. Otherwise, it was done very well. We still enjoyed a movie we have not seen in many, many years."
1,AVOID if deaf or hard-of-hearing. FALSE captions label,"I purchased this DVD because it's a great film - Doris Day and Frank Sinatra - how can you go wrong? I've seen it on TV captioned.However. I have to give the DVD 1 star because, while clearly labeled as closed-captioned (in TWO different places - on the back and on the spine), THIS DVD IS NOT CLOSED-CAPTIONED - OR subtitled. I am very hard-of-hearing and I NEED this function. Once again, Artisan/Rebublic DVD has ripped off the deaf and hard-of-hearing consumer with their false labeling. I've made this mistake before - with Artisan's release of ""Operation Petticoat,"" among others. I am now boycotting this company. I am deeply angry about this. Who do these people think they are? This DVD is useless to me, other than as a coaster."
1,Not for me...,When I was a kid I loved Godzilla. I use to ride the city bus over 7 miles to the closest theater every Saturday. Sometimes alone! Just to watch Godzilla! This movie would be great but the delivery with all the sub titles or the dubbing just does not appeal to me anymore. I must be getting old....
2,Very diappointed,"This godzilla movie I was looking forward to watching. I was very disappointed, since I had been looking for it."
1,japense sub,why do they not have option to cancel the japense sub because i like to watch without any sub on so it wont block the picture. why couldn't they just do the dubbed version and not the japense version
3,Good Godzilla flick,"They took their time on this one and did a great job on the special effects. However, its a little long and the story drags making it a little boring when Godzilla isnt around. Still worth checking out if you love G. But it isnt a MUST have."
4,inuyasha!!!godzilla!!!!Dragon ball Z!!!bond!!!fan. AND JESUS IS OUR SAVIOR,"!!!this is a very good movie, the story was well done the special effects were cool and the city devastating was awsome, this movie is my 2nd fave of the hesisi godzilla series [my first was godzilla 1985] but comparing it to godzilla 1985 it's a little boring g-1985 music was TOTALLY BETTER, the second fight with biollante was very good!"
5,BIG G,"This is my favorite BIG G movie. I have not seen many GODZILLA movies for sale.TOHO has made other monster movies, but none other are as good or are series.Biollante is one of my favorite creatures it is the only one that is created by a bio physicist. I think that TOHO should of made more GODZILLA movies"
3,godzilla vs. biolantte,"Godzilla returns yet again, this time he's up against a monster from his own cells. a plant monster known as biolantte. this one is colorful with good special effects and it's a change from previous godzilla movies. but the action is too slow."
3,not sure,We are huge Godzilla fans! We own a lot of Godzilla merchandise and lots of DVD's. I'm just not sure on this one. It seems to have a slow start and takes a bit for some Godzilla action.
4,Its Been Released.,"Well this was the only Godzilla movie that I didn't see. But now that I have the DVD I finally watched it. While this isn't the strongest of the second series it has its moments. But I am glad that it has been released on DVD for the first time because I am trying to complete my Godzilla Collection. I wish every release came with both the English Dub and the Japanese versions. Thankfully though this release comes with the English Dub and Japanese Audio so I guess all is well. Hopefully they can release every Godzilla movie in both versions, like Classic Media has done. But thankfully they didnt screw up with this version by giving us 1 or the other so all is well I guess."
5,Glad to have it in my collection...,"These DVDs (Godzilla DVD Collection) are made in China and are not of the best quality -- the special features simply run at the end of each film (I still haven't found a menu to access them directly), and the digital transfers are a bit sloppy. However, because a number of G films are either unavailable in America or have been heavily modified for our market, I'm glad to add them to my Godzilla collection, despite their flaws. Worth it if you're in the US and want to watch the Heisei Series from beginning to end, in widescreen and with as few made for America edits as possible."
4,The Plant that Kicks [...]!,"This movie was so great that it is almost impossible to tell ya. I will not give away the story. If you ever get the chance to buy this movie, do not waste it. You will be sorry if you do not get it. It is a rare Godzilla flick. The best Godzilla movie is right here."
3,The Heisei Era officially begins.,"The first official ""Heisei-era"" G film, Biollante isan entertaining adventure that sports some great spfx and a verycomplicated plot. Luckily, it was released uncut and letterboxed, a definite improvement over past issues of G films. The dubbing is bad, making one pine for a subtitled print someday. Several themes run through this film: the perils of genetic engineering, man's exploitation of nature and science, and the looming spectre of nuclear doom. The script would perhaps have benefitted from being narrowed down a bit, so as to be more focused but, its hits outnumber its misses. Unfortunately, the score is not very good, featuring a ""disco"" version of Ifukube's famous ""Godzilla March."" It is often inappropriate and downright annoying. All in all, a decent addition to the saga of the Big Guy."
5,"It was an excellent movie, the best Godzilla I've seen yet.","The movie made you think that Biollante was just going to be a huge flower, but it changed into a huge frightening creature.It had better acting, better special affects, and cooler creatures, I reccomend this movie. END"
2,Godzilla Vs Biollante[a plant],"Title says it all. My 5 year old son and I have been or are Godzilla fans since birth, and we probably will be G fans for life... but this is not his best movie, just sayin'."
4,"good,but different","i must start with saying that i love all the g flicks from king of the monsters to 2000 but this one is a bit different than normal,not too much but a little,its just not as fun to watch as the others,they have a certain charm about them thats not here,what makes this good is that its awesome,most godzillas are,but like king of the monsters they decided to make this serious which is why it got 4 stars,but not 5,not a good one to start with though,i say start with mechagodzilla or ghidorah the three headed monsters,but fans should not miss this one."
3,"Good effects,not the best ending.",This movie has very good effects for a godzilla film but the ending is pretty dumb.Godzilla basically passes out and Biollante floats away.Another thing about this movie that I don't like is they keep talking about telepathy.The person that uses telepathy is in all of the Godzilla films after this one.Her name on the Godzilla movies is Miki Sakusa(as most likely you big G fans out there already know and if you didn't well you learned something).Anyway this movie could have been better.One thing I don't like about my copy of this film is that it is in widescreen.But this film DOES have good effects.
4,Go Go Gojira!,"This is one of my favorites of the Godzilla franchise. Godzilla and Biollante are seriously cool monsters. The scenes with the monsters are done with a more serious tone than previous movies, which I liked. However there is still plenty of campiness from industrial spies, including bad acting, bad directing and totally unbelievable assumptions... what I've come to love from TOHO studios. The DVD had decent quality and played great."
2,Godzilla Vs Biollante up for american release.,"The quality of this DVD is good, but the fact it does not include the English language tracks and the subtitles are only fair makes this release less appealing. News on the american release of this title is EchoBridge has a planned released of this sometime in the next year. So with luck we might have a decent release coming soon."
5,huge fan,"Huge fan of godzilla movies i want to get them all on blue ray, so i was pretty happy this one came out on blue ray"
4,Great picture from a rare gem of kaiju films(Blu-ray),First off the Picture quality is superb. The Japanese dts 5.1 audio track sounds great. The English dub track is a bit lower though and is ok at best. It's presented in 1.85:1(16x9) widescreen and Includes subtitles as well. Special features are decent for these types of films. It comes with a making of and behind the design documentaries. I own a good Japanese bootleg dvd and it pales in comparison in almost all aspects(except for the special features) to this Blu-ray version. A must have for any giant monster movie lover.
3,Godzilla vs Biollante,"Not one of the big guys best. Biollante is not any thing surprising. If you have ever watched "" Little Shop of Whores"" you will see how both plant's look the same even its teethy buds are a lot alike.I'm a Godzilla fan the movies are great fun. Not this one. It is slow moving. The excitement is just not there."
3,Plus and Minuses,I was told by my 7 year old son who is sort of an expert on Godzilla movies that the plot was excellent but that the sound was bad.
4,godzilla fans everywhere,to be honest with you guys i actually found the dvd of godzilla vs biollante in english dubbed version on another website called monsterislandtoys.com for 24.99 plus shipping and handling it cool their are bringing this out on dvd but it is not english dubbed sorry guys i figured you should know this
4,Not the best,I really liked Biollante in its final form and the new G costume surprised me but I could notice that it got better in every new movie.
3,Hard Coded Japanese Subtitles?!?!,"When this film arrived i was overjoyed. To finally have this film is a dream come true after all these years. But then those dreams were dashed to the rocks. The blu-ray transfer is terrible. It feels more like a slightly cleaned up VHS copy. The other issue is that when someone that is a non-Japanese talks there are hard coded subtitles that cannot be turned off no matter how hard you try. The dubbing is fine, but it is impossible to remove the subs from the screen. I am very disappointed in this product. And most likely will be returned til they come out with a fixed and better version"
4,Better than I remember.,"I had the old VHS version of this movie, which I watched maybe once all the way through. The dubbing on the English version always made me wince to the point where I considered this film (and most of the 90s films)to be almost unwatchable, except for the monster scenes, which I always fast-forwarded to. The story in this movie is really dumb, but it works better in the original Japanese; the dialogue makes more sense. I say they did a great job with the transfer, and the extras were a lot of fun. Not one of my favorite Godzilla movies, but a welcome addition to my dorky collection. Like a lot of other fans, I only need a good copy of The Return of Godzilla to be complete. Get busy, Toho.While they're at it, they ought to release Gorath and The Human Vapor, too."
3,It's okay for what I paid for it.,"The case was extremely worn, but the upside it was the original case. This movie was supposed to be extremely good, but turned out to be alright. Being a Godzilla fan I found it to be entertaining. Not something that I plan to watch anytime soon. It didn't feel like a normal Godzilla movie."
5,Best Godzilla Release yet!,"Amazing Blu-ray of a classic Godzilla film. Echo Bridge did an amazing job on this release. By far the best Godzilla film release on DVD/Blu-ray. Super fast shipping by Amazon at an amazing price! Fully recommend buying this Blu-ray to all Godzilla fans.Special features are amazing. Nearly hour long make of featuring interviews, behind the scenes and never before scene footage & deleted scenes from the film. Also, Behind the Design of Biollante. Another amazing feature on this release."
4,Finally,Not sure why this release took so long but I'm glad it has finally become available.This is one of the better Godzilla movies in the Heisei series.
3,A bit disappointing,"I have waited a long time for this particular Godzilla film to come out on DVD. I was very pleased to see it in Blu-ray. I received a copy for my birthday and happily played it only to discover a few flaws. The picture quality is not the best, but probably the best the company could obtain for the conversion. What disturbed me most was no way to stop the subtitles. Yes, in the set up menu there is a button to turn off the subtitles, but no matter how many times I would hit the button, the subtitles remained. I know it may seem like a minor inconvenience, but it is a bit distracting. Hoping that a bettter version comes out in the future. All-in-all, still worth the mininal price."
2,It was lousy back then and its lousier on blu ray now,"This is one of the worst blu-ray transfer I have seen, its just lousy, worse than say an upconverted regular dvd.Second and finally the story is slooooow and forgettable, not much godzilla in this one. And the rose godzilla monster copy just falls apart when smacked up a bit.Personally this is my least favorite, mostly due to minimal godzilla, the maudlin pacing wooden acting, the godzilla ray reflector, and silly story in general."
2,My review thoughts,"I chose this rating because the DVD dose not give you many options for choosing English translation. You get English translation to be able to understand what they are saying but, everything else is in Japenese and that's not fair."
4,Good Action movie + decent Chan movie = Woo hoo!,"Let me say I'm a big fan of Michelle Yeoh, whom Co-stars in this movie, but she ends up not showing off her martial arts prowess as much as I'd like. At any rate, this was a good action movie, all you new fans of Chan will probably not want to get this one yet, but you action fans that liked ""Blade,"" or ""Universal Soldier"" will love this one."
4,This version is a decent buy,"It's just like all the jet li movies, but the dubbing isn't near as bad, not good, but certainly exceptable. I would like to see the full version, only if there are more fights, there were really not very many in this. As a whole, I would call this Jackie's best modern day film. And oh yeah, michelle yeoh is the shiznit. NICE STUNTS JACKIE, YOU HAVE TOPPED YOURSELF AGAIN."
2,"Plenty of action, but not JACKIE action.","While this film obviously had a huge budget and high production values, it seemed to forget that Jackie was the star. SUPERCOP relies heavily on car chases, gunplay, and explosions, and Jackie doesn't need those; we Chan fans want the action to come from his acrobatic body, not from an arsenal. (Oddly enough, though Jackie didn't do much martial artistry in this film, someone -- an American distributor, I'm guessing? -- thought it would be cute to have ""(Everybody Was) Kung Fu Fighting"" playing over the credits/outtakes -- OUCH!)I also get the feeling that this was really meant to be a star vehicle for the worthy Michelle Yeoh, and Jackie was included just to attract a larger audience. Nevertheless, the breathtaking climax on the train and the helicopter ladder are worth waiting for -- however, thanks to the fast forward button, I doubt I *will* wait through the rest of the action when I want to watch those final scenes again."
1,Disapointed,"I was very disapointed when I opened my DVD container, and there was no DVD inside the package. Amazon did make good on it."
2,Supercop,"The movie is ok but it is a superior film in Cantonese. The dubbed English is awkward and detracts from the film. I find the ""dubbing"" very annoying and would prefer the vintage Hong Kong Jackie Chan films marketed in the US be provided in the original language. Argggh!"
5,The adventures of Kai-Kui (Kevin Chan) continue!,"Among all of the American releases of Jackie Chan films, this one is the best. Though it is the third chapter of the ""Police Story"" series, the tone is much different from the first two. Jackie directed the first two and they are surprisingly really intense. Sure, there are some funny bits, but the action is razor sharp and Jackie gets really pissed off several times. In ""Supercop"" the tone is much lighter, maybe due to the direction by Stanley Tong. But don't get me wrong, this film is still great entertainment. Jackie and Michelle Yeoh (Billed as Michelle Khan) make a great team and trade stunts right and left. The final chase scene involving an armoured car, Chan hanging from a ladder of a speeding helicopter, Michelle jumping onto a moving train with a motorcycle, and the two of them taking down thugs on top of the train is something to behold. Maggie Cheung also returns again as Jackie's girlfriend."
2,I LOVE JACKIE BUT THIS ONE JUST DOESN'T CUT IT,"Now, I'm sorry, but I just did not like this movie at all. Since when do you find sex in a Jackie Chan movie. Every Chan movie I've seen has been appropriate for kids under 8 and then I saw this and I did not think some scenes were appropriate, plus there weren't too many great ""Chan"" stunts. It was a watered down Jackie Chan. Before you buy this, rent it, or buy Who Am I?"
1,Since when does Jackie let a woman upstage him!?!?!?!,"From what I saw of this film, The girl that he was with did most of the fighting! If you really want to see a great film about a Super Cop. check out Super Fuzz with Tarrence Hill and Earnest Borgnine... That film is better then this mess of a movie..."
2,.,"Eh. Less exciting than Chan's other American movies, with precious few hand-to-hand fights and many notable lulls. Khan handles her stunts impressively, but again, not much hand-to-hand, and personally, I'd just rather watch Jackie. Shrug. Skipable."
3,mixed review,"this was fairly easy to put together and all the accessories are extra fun to have. my problem with this is that the doors fall off everytime anyone goes near it. i have tried making screws tighter and pushing down on the top, but everytime my daughter opens the doors they come right off in her hand. another issue is that it is not easily moved around, the only way to pick it up is from the very bottom or it all comes apart and when carrying it the doors fall off - not really a surprise. i had to give 3 stars, nice idea with fun extras but i think the construction could use some major improvements."
3,Not great but OK,"We bought this for my 3 year old for Christmas and it barely made it through Christmas morning. She loves it and loves all of the things she can do with it, but really it is not a solid toy."
1,Does not assemble,"Assembly was very easy, until I tried to put the top tray on the base. The screw pegs did not match up...not even close!! It appears as though they mixed up components from a different model? Unfortunately, Christmas is just a couple of days away!! I am not a happy camper, but I feel worse for my daughter. I just read another review by someone who had the same issue."
3,should be for 3 and under!,I bought this last christmas for my 4 and 5 year old girls. They never played with it because it was too small for them. My 1 year old son however does like it! I think it is the perfect size for 18mo to 4 years old.
4,so easy to assemble,"This toy was so much more than I excepted. After reading reviews for similar toys I was dreading opening the box Christmas Eve, but much to my surprise assembly took less than 10 minutes, all the parts were there and the directions were easy to follow. My daughter loves it!! It is small enough to put away, but large enough for three 18 inch dolls to share (one sleeping in the tub, one in the crib and one in the highchair.) It's only the week after Christmas but it stood up to a play date with several other kids all less than 5.A good buy so far."
4,Great for big sister!,"I bought this as a big sister present for my 20 month old daughter when we brought her new baby sister home from the hospital. I put it together while 9 months pregnant, by myself, in less than 15 minutes.Big sister loves it! She mimicks with her dolls what I do to care for baby sister. Not only does she have something new and fun, but it keeps her occupied when the baby needs my attention. It isn't made to withstand climbing and wrestling, but for standard baby doll play, I'm pleased. I forsee some of the plastic toys getting lost... but that's life with a toddler!"
3,A disappointment,"My husband and I are a bit disappointed in this purchase. We really needed a raised queen sized air mattress for some house guests. When the bed was inflated it was nice and firm but for some reason the mattress kept losing air. We have checked for any pin holes, punctures, etc. but the mattress seems to be in good condition. The literature we received with the mattress stated that due to air fluctuations, the mattress will lose some air. Is this possible to happen overnight? Has anyone else experienced this problem? We'd really like to know."
2,lasted 3 months,this product was agreat for about 3 months .then it started loosing pressure. i only used it 3 times.know its collecting dust in the garage.i cant locate the leak.with the cost of return shipping .i would loose money sending it back.
4,"Nice air mattress, good value","I bought this as a substitute for an actual bed, to save space in our extra bedroom. Very convenient for family that visits & also for us when we travel. It's pretty nice and was firmer than I anticipated, which was good. Only drawbacks: it seemed to lose just a little air with my husband & me sleeping on it. We tended to roll to the center a bit. Also because of its height and no gap in the mid portion, I had to find specialty sheets, and of course they weren't cheap. Found Stearns & Foster sheets at Bed, Bath & Beyond that fit mattresses to 24"". We also used our foam mattress pad on top (under the fitted sheet)... It was almost just like a regular bed."
4,A great short-term solution.,Needed to stop using my last bed and not sure what type I'm going to purchase next. This is working out great as an interim solution. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars was because you have to remember NOT to roll too close to the sides or else you roll/fall off. If you heed this you'll have a 5-star experience. :)
1,Bad product,"Only if u like 2 use if for 3days it's fine not more then thatReally disappointed, Even the limited warranty is for 30days ; Don't buy this one."
4,Comfortable,This air mattress blows up very quickly with practically no hassle. The bed is comfortable and my queen sized jersey sheets fit and stayed on the bed easily. The bed seemed to get a little softer as I slept. I will account that mainly to my personal size. I really think at least thus far that this bed is ideal for my purposes.
5,Great bed,I bought this to go camping and this bed is excellent. I really like that it sits so high off the ground (as close to a real bed as you can get). It is very comfortable (as far as blow up mattresses go). I let my guests use it when they come to my house and i have never had a complaint. 2 people can comfortably sleep on this queen size mattress. It inflates in seconds and the cord stores into the bed so you will never loose it.
4,Best bed,"I am at this address for a short while, not enough time to invest on an expensive mattress I won't be able to take with me when I relocate. This bed fit the bill, according to the reviews. It is a cinch to inflate. It is hyper-comfortable, sort of like a water bed. I have had it for only 2 months, but ""so far so very, very, good""!"
3,Good detailed reference,"This book was a requirement for my paramedic class (Washington State). It had every drug I needed to look up and gives detailed information about each drug, it's use, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, side effects, contraindications, side effects, and pre-hospital considerations.However, there are some differences of opinion on some of the drug dosages and uses with my teachers, fellow students, paramedics and other drug guide manuals.Over all I'd say a good reference, but not the end-all be-all. A useful tool in conjunction with others.Also, it's pages are not weather resistant like other EMS pocket guides. I rarely use it in the field. However, it's been useful for other study purposes. I'd recommend buying a used copy."
4,An outstanding field reference,"I have used this book in the field and found it to be an asset. This is a must have for any paramedic. The Home Medication section in the back is the most important for me. It is hard to keep up with the new drug out now, never mind remembering what classification they are. I found this very thorough as far as medic field medications and the explanations, interactions, contraindications, etc.. for each. A must for all students.As said in another review, waterproof pages would make this book a 5+."
4,Out-Dated (2010),"Great guide, but its out-dated now (2010)theres a green one which covers a lot more and I think it even contains a broselow scale, same price my buddy got it right after I got this one and now I want that one..This book is a good field guide tho, so I cant complain, just a little old"
4,Great med guide,"This little med guide is another great tool for the medic. It has all the information one needs on emergency medications. It may be alittle indepth for use on the truck, but for fast, easy reference it is a must."
4,Good lube. Not so good bottle.,"I bought this based on the favorable reviews I read here on Amazon. I only use my marker a few times each year, so I try to lubricate all the parts before playing and more importantly before long term storage.My relatively inexpensive Spyder semiauto performed well out of the box, but became a well oiled beast after breaking it down and lubricating the moving parts. In some ways the applicator tip is conservative, however it is blunt enough that it is difficult to get a perfect needle nose application. This is compounded by the fact that this stuff runs. It diffuses through your marker and will leak out of any crevices. However, this can be a good thing if you can mitigate excess oil. I would also note that I am using a polymer bolt (delrin maybe?) without any problems so far.This would be a five star item if it had a more precise applicator, and if they formulated this to be slightly thicker with less run."
5,Good oil,"What can I say, it does what is meant to be, lubricate your marker.I use it on my Tiberius T9 without any problem."
2,Bor-ing,"When will I learn that books on the BEST SELLER LIST may not be the best in the world? This is one of the worst books I have ever struggled through. I do not like the author's shifts in time, his imagery, the interweaving of the characters pasts with the present. Instead of Anil's Ghost, it should have been Gamini's Story. He was the most interesting, fascinating character in the book. I was never sure of what in the world was going or why! Amazon probably won't think this review worthy. Who decides what books gets on the bestseller list, anyway?"
3,good,"This is a good book. It had an interesting story line and I did not find it hard to follow like some other readers have. I enjoyed it, but I don't think it was one of Ondaatje's best."
2,Too Dry like a college Text book,I agree with most of the reviewers that gave not more than 2 stars.This is one of the slow moving Fiction novel without a strong plot that can keep the readers on their toe for continuous reading.I liked the last part of the narrative and the formation of the character Gamini.
3,"Great background on Sri Lanka, poorly developed characters",The story of a Western educated Sri-Lankan women who returns to her native land as a forensic anthropologist investigating murders of the skeletons she finds. I found it hard to truly relate to or care about the characters in this book. But it's an easy to read story and gave me some insight into the human rights abuses in Sri Lanka as well as descriptions of the landscape.
4,The human face of the news we don't want to hear...,"In order to maintain our sanity, we live on the very margin of our conscience, barely conscious of the world around us. If we want to step deeper inside this world, the revelations will ruin us for the lack of solutions for the ever existent human crises. A mere glimpse into the world will make us longing for the peace of mind we once had, to find an easy solution or forget the truth of life altogether. The absent minded happiness and peacefulness of the middle class is the healthiest/least self-destructive of all available ways to ignore the world. This book is about the people who can't escape the truth, either because they live in the midst of it or because they were thrown in and forced to face it.Whatever is lacking here in the quality of a solidified prosaic form is irrelevant due to the immediacy of the human tragedy that is happening in Sri Lanka and other countries. Read it just to become part of the real world, nor for any other reason."
2,Bad audiobook,"Anil's ghost was probably a great book. Cerntatinly the authors prose is very poetic and the descriptions of Sri Lanka are wonderful. But, if you listen to the audiobook, you will have NO IDEA who is saying what as the reader does nothing what-so-ever to distinguish the voices. It was extremely frustrating.Buy the book, skip the audiobook."
3,Critique of audiobook version,"I just finished the audiobook version Anil's Ghost. There is virtually nothing to help the listener distinguish the different characters. At times it was almost hopelessly impossible to follow conversations between the main characters.Other than this, the book was excellent. Ondaatje's prose is really increadible. I am convinced that this book is better read than listened to."
2,I must have missed something here...,"I loved ""The English Patient"". I really hoped this would be just as mesmerizing. Instead, ""Anil's Ghost"" starts out interesting, building up the mystery for half the book regarding the skeleton dubbed ""Sailor"", but then fizzles. The last half was ssslllloooowwww, confusing, elaborating on stuff that didn't matter, and spun away from (what I thought was) the main story/mystery. At the end I found I just wanted it over and I didn't really care what happened. Sorry. Really wanted to like it. Can't recommend it."
3,did i miss something?,"I, like many others, apparently, felt like I missed something. Yes, the characters were interesting in their starkness and detached-ness. Yes, the way this author uses language is impressive. Yes, the premise was intriguing.But I got to the end and thought, ""huh?"" I re-read the ending 3 times and still had no clue what had happened. I met with my book club to discuss it and still felt like I didn't get it. I am not an idiot-- I'm a pretty avid reader of a wide variety of literature-- but this book just did not do much for me. I felt very frustrated-- like some said here, I wanted to like it, but I just couldn't."
3,"It's Sri Lanka, but it could be Mexico or So. America","A unique style of writing. What struck me was that the Sri Lanka setting could have been replaced with locations like Mexico or any where in So. America, as well as other countries. The disappearance of every-day people without government concern continues around the world. In Juarez, Mexico, hundreds of young girls & women disappear every day and even with forensic scientist, such as Anil, no justice results. I found the story good and would recommend reading it, even though it was slow in some areas."
3,Meeting a Deadline and Failing the Reader,"The three-star rating is indicative of my frustration in thoroughy enjoying a well-written novel with rich characterization, imagery and suspense that builds to a climax but fails to deliver. I suspect that Ondaatje had a deadline to meet and therefore threw the reader into an abrupt end missing an opportunity to deliver another Ondaatje classic. Unfortunate!"
2,Starts strong and falls apart,"Anil is an interesting woman, and for the majority of the book, we follow her journey back to a Sri Lankan home that's recognizable, yet in some ways shockingly alien. Anil is intropective, but surprisingly numb. She seems disassociated from herself and her feelings.Suddenly, the book turns into a heavy handed political statement. Anil is lost as the author takes the cheap and easy route to make a rather banal point, which just kills any legitimate emotional involvement. It's as if the first part of the book is something literary and interesting, while the ending goes for the simple sell.Do not waste your time reading this dissappointment."
3,Almost great,"A fun read, but it's missing... something.In the Skin of a Lion is Ondaatje's best. English Patient is really good, too, as are some of his other books.Here's a book that has his same techniques, but this one never quite pulls together the same way. It almost does, but no. If you like Ondaatje, pick this one up. If you don't, well, you wouldn't be looking at this review if you didn't like Ondaatje, right..."
2,Read only if very desperate for reading material,"The only thing I knew about Sri Lanka before picking up this book was that it lays on the Indian Ocean. The book was educative in that i learned more about the armed conflict they suffered in the 80s, its landscape, history, archeology, but as a piece of literature it was very, very rough to handle. There is an array of characters that don't serve much purpose, because they don't help define others. Anil is supposed to be the protagonist, yet her first husband, her parents, her caretaker Lalitha, her friend Leaf or her lover Cullin add nothing to the story and distract from the core. The narration is not terribly linear, and I found that there were many gaps in the story. I hate it when an author spells everything out for you, but Ondaatje's economy of plot and description were too much of a workout for my brain"
2,This is not a book for everybody,"I like the movie ""English Patient"" very much. However,I totally agreed with what Angela Belt said. I found this book extremely boring."
2,Find another Ondaatje to read,"Ondaatje is one of the best writers writing today. This book, however, is his worst. Whatever you do, don't read this first."
4,Slow paced and thought provoking,"As I finished this book, I wasn't really sure how I felt about it. Some of the sections are just haunting, and the prose is beautiful. But the overall pace of the book is very slow, and there is no compelling plotline. It's possible to pick the book up, read a couple of pages, and then put the book back down again for days. So it's not a summer, take to the beach, book. But if that's not what you're looking for, this is a beautiful book."
3,Anil's Ghost,"...This book seems to have been inspired by the wonderful poetry in his book Handwriting. If only it could have been as good. Anil's Ghost feels like it was a screen play and treatment for Hollywood that was then turned into a novel. It is disjointed, hard to follow and poorly written...The buddhist images and thoughts are lovely, especially the story of the eye painter, but otherwise, it is uninspired and a big big disappointment for someone who has loved his work up to this point."
2,Why?,"I have to say that when I bought this book I thought it would grab me from the first page, but sadly it didn't. It was extremely slow and too factual, most of it was in ""past tense"" and made me feel as if perhaps there was another book that I should have read before this one. Maybe it just wasn't my style. I was part of the small population of people who enjoyed ""The English Patient"". I feel like I let someone down for not finishing this book.."
3,A good read,"Anil Tissera has spent much of her life in America but she returns to her homeland, Sri Lanka, commissioned by an international human rights group to determine the source of murder campaigns on the island. Anil is a forensic anthropologist and she is assigned to work with Sarath, a local official. Bodies are discovered. When they identify a skeleton buried on a site where only government officials have access it seems their results could prove the government responsible for his and other deaths. That is when the plot starts warming up. The characters in this book are as wonderful as those Ondaatje created in The English Patient though I cannot say I enjoyed this book as much as his earlier ones."
4,Engaging and Moving.,"Haunting and yet beautiful, an entry to a tragically violent and oppressive period in Sri Lanka, this book explores the love of country, the fear and suffering of its people and the conflicting emotions of the westernised Anil who returns. Resistance is brave, yet exists amid murder and torture and ever present intricately described culture of its people. The writing is at times almost hypnotic, at times starkly real. A great book."
2,Boring,"Difficult to get through. Wasn't able to concentrate on story, couldn't hold my interest. Wouldn't recomend to anyone looking for story to sink your teeth into."
2,disappointing,The author didn't meet my expectations the story has too many unfinished subplots and you can never see the end
3,I didn't really care,"While the novel deals with the tragic and pain of civil war--from murders and torture, to split families and corruption, the author could not make me care about neither the main characters or the Sri Lanka people. Going back and forth between the present and the past, the novel did not provide me with enough information about teh country and about the personal motivations of the characters. It was probaby meant to be like that but it did not work for me."
3,Well...,"I thought ""Anil's Ghost"" was good because of the writing style. For me, it was beautifully poetic and for the most part, easy to follow. I relize, though, that it wasn't really easy to follow for many of the reviewers, so it just depends.However, my biggest gripe with the book is how it ends. Except with the character ""Sarath"", you really don't know what happens to the rest of them. And with the last few pages, I had to force myself to read them just to get to the end.Overall, I would recommend this book, but it won't be the best book you've ever read."
2,I wanted to like this book,"I wanted to read this book. I really wanted to like this book, but I really could never get into it. I thought the style was beautiful. Although Mr. Ondaatje is a very poetic writer, the plot did not capture my imagination or attention."
4,Sri Lankan Beauty and Sri Lankan Horrors to Haunt,"This book was beautiful and disturbing. In and through the weavings of human grief and beauty, Ondaatje also characterized the country of Sri Lanka. The discriptions of rampant political violence were frightening and heart rending. But I came to love Sri Lanka more than any character. It would have been nice to have a map of Sri Lanka handy to locate the frequent references to place names.As noted by another reviewer there are many memorable phrases. One quote I liked was:""The important thing is to be able to live in a place or a situation where you must use your sixth sense all the time.""I loved Anil's Ghost, but would recommend it only to those who love Sri Lanka, poetry, or Ondaatje."
2,"A fragmented, hopeless story.","An ill-defined investigation into the identity of a murder victim's skeleton forms a shaky framework for ""Anil's Ghost,"" a story of civil war-torn Sri Lanka. The story, such as it is, is told in disjointed bits, unrelated in time or place. This needn't have been a problem; many effective novels aren't linear. However, the scattered glimpses of people's pasts and characters that comprise ""Anil's Ghost"" are more just shards than functioning pieces of a larger whole.This is a fragmented, hopeless story, and reading it was a chore. The only reason I'm not sorry to have spent the time on it is because I could, sometimes, appreciate how its (sort of) poetic style might appeal to another reader.By the work's end I was simply glad to have it over with. I'm not in a hurry to read more from Michael Ondaatje."
2,Anil's Ghost,"Didn't really ""get"" this book. I found it very disjointed, and thought it lost its plot about halfway throught the book. I was disappointed."
4,ANIL'S GHOST,AWESOME. Cleverly written to make the reader unable to put down the book. The story sticks with you in the beginning thru the end. This writer really knows how to write a book and I'm looking forward to pursuing other works.
2,And you thought the English Patient was a rough read.,"Now it took me 3 attempts and the movie to finally get through The English Patient and I was enjoying the story. This one, however was a chore after the first 15 pages. I've picked it up, I've put it down, I've picked it up again, and finally the last time I decided to put it down on the seat on the subway next to me and pretend I never bought it in the first place. It seems like it was written with hatred of the reader in mind. I'm getting a headache just thinking about it."
3,Why isn't anything happening here?,"Like many ""literary"" novels, Anil's Ghost focuses on character to the near exclusion of plot. While the characters are certainly exotic and complex, I found myself wanting a little bit more than poetic vignettes of their personal histories. Forgive me, but I wanted them to DO something---I wanted something to HAPPEN to them. Admittedly I do not often read fiction of this ilk but is it so much to ask for a serious novel these days to have a plot? There's no need to turn the search for Sailor's identity into a Tami Hoag potboiler. But on the other hand, one wishes that there was something at stake here, some suspense. Or at the very least a narrative that reveals something about Sri Lanka as a people, as a predicament, rather than simply using pretty language to give the illusion of characterization."
1,The emperor has no clothes,"This is one of those books where the elegance of the prose, the writer's reputation and the ecstasy of the critics mask the fact that there's nothing there.The characters - especially Anil - have no reality to them, and neither do the plot devices. I couldn't for the life of me figure out how an international commission working under poltically-sensitive guidelines, would be allowed to go off on the tangent of trying to identify a suspicious skeleton, and what purpose there was in doing this.I have some specialized knowledge of the situation in Sri Lanka and, terrible as it is, I didn't feel that the book reflected it in an accurate way. It highlighted atrocities and gore, but gave no insights into the ethnic and cultural causes and results of all these years of war.A terribly-disappointing effort."
2,Yawn....,"I really detested the movie ""The English Patient"", but I realize that books are almost always superior to the movies, so I thought I would give this book a chance.Anil's Ghost has the potential to be a very interesting book. I thought the subject matter and the characters would be very compelling and interesting. Alas, I was wrong. The book plods along endlessly, with excruciatingly slow plot development and very poor character development. I often felt that the author had put a lot of emphasis on writing prettily, rather than writing well.Avoid wasting your time with this book, and look into Mary Wesley, for a bit of GREAT writing."
3,Anil alienated me,"Anil's Ghost sounded great: complicated characters, exotic locale, twisting plot, puzzle to be solved. However, the characters are all so estranged (and to be frank, strange) that it is difficult to care about them. Instead of pulling together to weather the strife of civil war, these characters, and the communities they inhabit, withdraw and hide from danger and uncertainty.Michael Ondaatje succeeds in making me feel a bit of the anxiety and uncertainty of the Sri Lankan experience, but at the cost of engaging me in the story. I got the point, but don't want to do anything with it.Ondaatje can sure turn a phrase, and he can capture a mood like no one else. If you're a serious word person, who reads for love of language, or if atmosphere alone is enough for you, don't miss this novel. On the other hand, if you're a recreational reader who enjoys a linear story, Anil's Ghost isn't for you."
3,Anil's Ghost : A Novel (Vintage International),This book was good because I was in Sri Lanka while reading it. I am not sure if I was back in Texas that I would like it as much. But great to read pre/post a trip to the area.
1,why did i read this?,"this has to be, quite possibly, the most boring, longwinded book i have ever read. was there even a plot to this mundane story? believe me, i would not have read this of my own free will and anyone who does is a sucker for punishment. sure, some would argue the underlying themes of suffering and the importance of laying bare the horrors of war. blah, blah, blah! in my mind, a book should be both enjoyable as well as have a point, two things which, in my opinion, this book is lacking. lest anyone think that i am just being too harsh, perhaps you should try and muddle through this tiresome piece of literary garbage and then post your own opinion. reading this book was a task that i did not enjoy and i warn everyone to not even bother with it. unless it is required, don't read it! to sum it all up, one star is being generous."
1,Bo-ring,"I couldn't wait to get this book. I was in Sri Lanka in '88-'89, the peak of the JVP vs government vs LTTE war that serves as backdrop for the book. And at times he really captures the images and moods perfectly. But there's too little Sri Lanka and too much of Anil's (a girl with a boy's name) uninteresting ruminations about her past. Gamini is a little more interesting, but I kept wanting to just get on with the story already. Not a ""thriller"", not much suspense or mystery or action. I never got interested in ""Sailor"" or understood why this one skeleton was a big deal. What little action there is happens blandly. Bo-ring. It reminded me for some reason of John Le Carre's ""A Perfect Spy"" (which I read while at an abandoned resort in Sril Lanka), another tedious, boring and disappointing book about what should be an exciting topic. In both books we get lots of dreamy reflection and an ugly but strangely anticlimatic ending"
3,I wish...,"...I could've gotten this to work for me. It looked great, I think it's one of the best-looking R/C helos out there. The LED light in its nose was very cool & bright, I was pleasantly surprised.I happened to get a defective unit because after charging it up, it wouldn't respond to the controls. After trying for half an hour, letting it charge all the way down and recharging, it responded for maybe a minute, and then quit responding again. The SilverLit customer support was very friendly though and worked with me. I just decided to return it because I had to recover some money on an unrelated, unexpected expense.I would probably come back and try getting another one again though, just because it looked so cool and the SilverLit customer service was so friendly. Like any other R/C helicopter though, it will take a litle bit of practice before you can enjoy it fully, and like any other R/C helicopter, it probably won't last too long with kids under 10."
2,Not Worth It,I was highly dissapointed in this book. I have many other David Carter books and I thought this one did not measure up at all. My son is not at all interested in it and the giggling bug just sounds dumb and is not very loud. At least I got it in the clearance bin so I dodn't waste too much money.
2,Book for older kids,"my 4 1/2 year old son and 16 month old daughter loves the David Carter books. However, this book is for older kids. the 4 1/2 yr old does not get the silly jokes yet."
1,Do not buy this!!!!!!!!,"Cute book in regards to content. As for the giggle. It stopped working after being pushed 5 times. This is the second time I have tried to get this book, but the giggle battery dies out or malfuntions. Don't bother to waste your time and money."
4,Kids love it,"My daughter got this book when she was about 4 years old. We had to explain a few of the jokes, but she was on a roll with it right away. This is a book that kids will love, even as their parents are going crazy listening to the little bug laugh again and again and again..."
2,Cracked soon after installation,"Worked fine for a brief period, then suddenly cracked and had to be replaced.Replaced with chrome plated, brass valve - would no longer use plastic for such connections."
1,Worst Rap Group Ever,This CD is so bad that I can't even find a used record store or E-Bay to buy it back at $2.
3,Not for use on large burner gas stoves,It certainly is made well enough but that flat plate 'bonded' to the bottom is too small. My stove has two large burners on the front and the flames completely miss the plate and just warm the sides. I have smaller burners in the back but there isn't enough room to get the wok squarely over the burner. Might be better with electric stove but if you have gas and large burners in the front I'd pass this one up.
4,You'll wish you were there,"This is a great little movie with a supurb cast. Additionally, the filming is beautiful. Good for people of all ages, with some sexual innuendo, but no violence or language. I would see it again and again and I have recommended it to friends."
3,Mark Knopfler,I bought it for Mark Knopfler's music really. LOL The movie is 3 stars at best. Kind of strange.
3,Good DVD,"While I was entertained by this DVD, it was not my favorite in this type of story. Good acting. Burt Lancaster was good. I didn't get involved as much with the characters."
4,Should Be In Blue ray,Hi all just got this movie and i think its a reat movie i wish every body should watch this movie its just a great movie but it should be in blue ray blue ray i get so mad that movies like this are not in blue ray please do me a favor rent it or buy it its a winner trust me
5,Lovely movie,"This basic premise of this movie (someone goes to destroy the quaint atmosphere of a remote location and ends up falling in love with it) is much used, but many times ends up appearing contrived or mushy. Not so with this wonderful film. What the scenery itself doesn't take care of is left to a group of marvelous actors. It doesn't seem like a movie at all. It is closer to a real-life situation than any recent movie I've seen. I love this film."
5,A Classic,"This is sweet, funny, sly and an absolute gem. This is Bill Forsythe's classic.No one who sees this film- and has a heart- could not, at the end, hit replay.It is too magical for words. If you have given up on the magic of movies, see this one and have your faith restored.It is perfect."
5,"charming, quirky, poetic, with a great score by Mark Knopfler","if you could take the humor of monty python and process it in the dream time of an aborigine warrior, you might get something like this. add DIRE STRAITS guitarist Mark Knopfler's aurora-inspired soundtrack, and you get a minor classic-- even, perhaps, a desert island film."
4,Mixed reviews,"Lent this to a friend, and she said after watching it, ""What was that about?"" This movie hit me on the deepest level, but apparently the eye of the beholder has much to do about how one enjoys this. This is one of my favorite films, but the DVD is a pretty poor transfer. The late scene where the female biologist/geologist departs is nearly invisible. Still, the sense of finding something one didn't even know they wanted, then losing it, is the heartbreaking conclusion of this extremely funny film."
3,Scottish Village,"This movie is mixed feelings for me because although a tiny village in Scotland is a beautiful and natural setting for a movie, the plot was not played out to its fullness. Also the music was not used to potential total effect."
2,"Very Boring, and Unrealistic -","Burt Lancaster is a Texas billionaire who prefers star-gazing to managing his international oil company. The original plan is to buy a small Scottish fishing village so his firm (Knox Oil) can drill in the North Sea.The townspeople are excited by the chance for riches - except for one resident living alone in what best could be described as a shack. He's the key, however, owning four miles of beachfront. Lancaster comes onto the scene to push negotiations and eventually agrees to just back away."
1,Would have given zero stars...but 1 is the minimum,"My wife, son (freshman in college), and I watched this last night. Contrary to the other reviews, we did not find it charming, whimsical, or funny. I may have had a mild chuckle once or twice during the film. I would characterize it as lame and boring."
1,Can't believe I wasted the time - amazing,For those with insomnia - this will fix it.Pay the postage and take our DVD.We are stunned that others would recommend such nonesense.Considering truly great cinema not yet available on DVD - who's the invalid that got this one burned onto disk?
1,difference of opinion,"This is one of those movies that you watch and finally when the credits roll you kick yourself for wasting the time and effort to do so.The bomb dropping jets? The guy on the motorcycle? The briefly hit on relationship between Mac and the other guy's wife? The marine biologist turning into a mermaid? Please, some one explain the relivance.The ending seemed as though the writer needed a quick way out of a poorly written movie. I'll bet Burt Lancaster turns in his grave (is he dead?-if he isn't he should be after making this dud) every time some one waist their time trying to watch this movie.The main reason I watched the movie was because of the soundtrack that was written by Marc Knopfler-great music, terrible movie."
1,"Boring, boring, boring.....","Apparently, people who like this movie don't like to see it criticized. This is apparent in the number of 'unhelpful' votes this review has been given (far more than it would have if I just said a single sentence about how great it is). But, I still hated the movie and thought it was boring. You may like it, and if you do, great. Here's my original review:This is by far the most boring movie I've ever seen. I would have turned it off, but I kept expecting that something (anything) interesting would happen. Nothing interesting ever happened, though there were a couple of funny spots. I'd like to have those two hours of my life back. I fortunately didn't waste my money buying the DVD, but rented it instead. Even after reading some of the reviews here, I don't know what anyone could like about this movie. I would have given it zero stars if possible."
1,"O the horror, misery, and nonsense, when will it end?","I saw this on Turner Classic Movies. It was utterly the most wasted 2 hours I have spent through my entire existence on this planet. This movie had a poor excuse for a plot, very little if any plot development, terrible story line, and failed to make a shred of sense. It left me asking, what is the point of this poor excuse for a movie? It was so bad, it should be taken off of the shelves everywhere. The guy who introduced it on TCM needs to have his head examined. I give it negative stars out of 5. In short ladies and gents, this movie should be avoided at all cost. I am totally in agreement with the guy who only gave it one star and made a 6 item gripe list on it. Good day to you all. I hope this review is helpful."
5,"Viewed it 6 + times - yes it's that good, Brit/Amer Humor!","I knew this would be a great one from the beginning. Characters fill into many roles and there in lies the confusion as a Texas Oil employee (driven by company and US culture of) tries to get in and out of the ""BIG DEAL"" without a hair missing from his worsted wool suit. Peter is good at any role, it's a given.. Burt is refreshingly fun to watch and these are only the names you may recognize! Between the stock savy Russian and the boat that has no name.. yes it's a romp and a fun one!"
5,If ever stuck in some remote place .........,"""Local Hero"" is a movie I return to time and time again. Knopfler's Celtic tinged score gets to my soul, the cinematography is stunning, wonderful story and dialog, and no way to single out any peformances because nearly all of the actors are right on to the role. (Well, maybe the rabbit with two names stands out -- I love all the scenes involving the hare!). For me, even more than this being arguably Forsyth's best (out of so many choices), it is an all-time 10 best film."
3,What did I miss?,How did I miss any description of this DVD being made for a foreign country and dubbed in their language? Certainly that description wasn't in the title for the DVD. What a waste of money. When I set my player/recorder for English it does subtitle the movie in Englich but that's not the experience I thought I was buying. Silly me. Am sure it's not the seller's fault but I'm still not happy with my long awaited purchase.
4,"Charming, quirky film set in Scotland","Local Hero is a genuine cult movie, the kind that has a small but devoted following of fans, though it's not popular among other people who don't ""get it."" It concerns a trio of executives from a huge Houston corporation (led by Burt Lancaster, who is excellent in an unusual-for-him comic role) who travel to the remote Scottish Highlands to negotiate the purchase of an entire village as an oil trans-shipment port. The film's appeal is hard to explain: much of the humor is of the dead-pan, shaggy dog type, and the atmosphere continually verges on fantasy without quite showing anything that's literally impossible. The well-photographed Scottish landscape is extremely beautiful. All in all, a very enjoyable, unfairly neglected film. No particular advisories, though much of the humor will be beyond children. Warner Home Video DVD transfer very good."
5,"""I wonder what the poor people are doing today""","Being a scot this has to be one of those rare occasions where a british / american produced film worked well on both sides. Local hero is a classic comedy reminiscent of the ealings classic 'Whiskey galore'. Burt Lancaster was brilliant as was the rest of the cast, scored with a excellent soundtrack by the dire straits front man Mark Knopfler, and filmed beutifully. This has to be by far as Bill Forsyth's best. Despite its age, it is still a very charming and funny film, something rare compared to most of the pictures coming out nowadays. Well worth a look."
4,Her Rough Journey to Understanding,"This book is about the journey of a high school student to understand herself, and the trauma and the struggles she has faced growing up with a successful mother. This book, I won't give anything away, is addictive and somewhat of a quick read. It made me smile, feel sad, and gasp at a few parts. Its a great teen suspense and personal growth novel. I recommend this highly."
5,Caitlin Gallagher - Bak Middle School of the Arts,"As I began reading ""The Night I Disappeared"" I realized the it was one of a kind. This is one of the few books that I have ever read that kept me wanting to keep on reading. This well written book makes you feel as though you are right there with 17-year-old Jamie Tessman as she experiences her mind slips that bring her back to Webb. This book is filled with unexpected twists that leave itching to turn the page to understand what's REALLY going on between what seems to be two different worlds trying to suck her in. Moving to Chicago rips her away from what she thought she once knew and throws her into the city that sends her into these mind slips of how life was like back in California. I suggest that ever one read this book due to its amazing details, plot and well defined characters."
3,"nice color and fabrick, bad work on chraftsmanship and stitching",I like the color and the thick fabric but had to have my Mom remove the Velcro and restitch it because it comes with the velcro on the wrong side. The one im replacing one I have had forever and im comparing it to that one. The velco are both on the inside so when you loop it over your head it will stick up in a point.
2,No Christmas Joy Here,"Even if you like corny, sentimental Christmas stories (and I do), this one is too much. Katherine Helmond is a competent actress, but Sid Caesar, as an actor... well he should stick to comedy.Poor overall story line and characters are SO sweet, if you're over the age of 8 they'll make your teeth ache.Includes a free music CD that I haven't even bothered to listen to. I already have Christmas music with artists I enjoy, so this was no bonus for me.Sorry, but even with its low price, I recommend you give this a pass."
1,REVIEW BY REBA,I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THE LENGTH OF THE MOVIE. IT WAS OVER ALMOST BEFORE THE MOVIE GOT STARTED INTO THE PLOT. I DO THINK THAT CHILDREN WILL LIKE IT THOUGH.
1,Worse Christmas Movie I Have Ever Seen,"This was the worse Christmas movie I have ever seen. I counted on other reviewers, but they let me down. Most of the reviews were so positive and I am a movie buff, also a Christmas movie collector. I doubt I will ever watch it again. The best thing I can say about this movie is it is short."
4,A great Christmas show!,"The Christmas Snow bought back fond memories, I'd read the short story and the show was faithful to the bookThe acting was beleivable and uit was an excellent Christ,mas show, something that fits beautifully with the season ."
5,A Christmas Seasonal Story,"Purchased for viewing during Christmas, arrived quickly and in good shape, enjoyed the film which was fairly old and somehow missed by me during the times it was released, I suspect a made for T.V. Movie when it was released..It has a good story line and delivers a message as well.."
1,Bad movie,Bad acting and a ridiculous plot. Within 10 minutes you could see what was going on and how it would end. Fortunately it was not a long movie and I had time to prepare this thing for a quick visit to a yard sale. BAD movie
2,Not the best!,I love Christmas but this movie will be one that I watch once. Not a very good movie at all.
3,"Not History, but definitely -packed","Ok history buffs, this movie isn't for you. The story loosely follows historical events, but it is more into the fantastical realm. Now, I could understand it being made from the point of view of the Greeks at the time, the fantastical creatures were their perception of normal people. But, in general, it's inspiring and gripping. A fun movie, if you accept the fact that it's *not* fact."
4,Cheap and still working,I was surprised how well the card works. Still is working but if using the overclocked drivers you will burn out your card. I took a pencil eraser to the contacts to take of the burning that would have occurred even more if I would not have checked the card. Download the regular drivers from nvidia and if you want to mess with clocks get ntune where you can test the stability also.
1,Avoid at all costs.,"I knew that WD quality control has been going down in the last few years, but I was still foolish enough to give this a try. This probably shouldn't be a surprise, but the drive was DOA. It makes loud noises when spinning up, then seems to work fine for 5-10 minutes, then another loud noise, and it causes a blue screen. I'm waiting for the RMA now."
1,this movie was terrible,This movie blows. Never see it. THe acting is pittiful and the plot is depressing and boring. I suggest you never see it.
1,Utter Crap,This movie was disgusting. It makes jokes about obesity & retardation. I find neither one of these issues to be humorous. I also found the movie to be quite depressing. I expected so much more from Johnny Depp. Also I never believe it to be a good idea for a non mentally handicapped person to portray one in movies. To think Dicapprio was nominated for an Oscar is enough to make me doubt the sanity of the Oscar committee.
5,"Perfect, just what i needed","This was just what I was looking for, brand new and fast shipping. thank you for being a fast shipper"
3,Done well.,"This is an old movie, but a good one. Remember Johnny Depp back then? He was so good at his craft even then. Good story line."
3,nice movie,Not one I could always sit down and watch over and over again. I bought it as a gift becuase it was so cheap/
5,One of the Bets of the Best!!!!,"I think that What's Eating Gilbert Grape is one of the best movies I've ever seen next to Titanic and The Man in the Iron Mask. Leo played an excellent job as a mentally challenged teenager. If I had never seen Leo before in any other movies or magazines, I would probally think Leo really was a mentally challenged teenager!!! I can definitly see how Leo recieved an oscar nomination for his performance in What's Eating Gilbert Grape!!!!!!! END"
4,Portriat of Small Town USA,"Set in a small town in Iowa, the characters of a unique family work through life. I think the small town aspect of this film is crucial to it's overall feeling. It has a rural disfuction about it. an air of uncivility. The irony is, these people are more civilized than most city folk in their purity alone.Depp gives a great performance, while DiCaprio plays one of his best roles yet. If you grew up in a small town this film will undoubtedly touch a nerve.See this film, or better yet read the book. The book is amazing aswell and offers some situations that weren't in the film."
5,That Darn Johnny,"This movie is a fine (and an early) example of Johnny Depp's willingness to choose a quirky, powerful story and run with it. At a time when he could have been churning out 'heartthrob' pictures, he was acting in pictures like 'Benny and Joon', 'Gilbert Grape' and 'Edward Scissorhands'.This movie is especially noteworthy, as it may well be the last time Leonardo DiCaprio did not completely suck."
3,"Good, But Not Great","This movie clearly had aspirations to be one of the all-time great films, and looking at the reviews, many believe it accomplished the goal. In my humble opinion, this is overall a good, but not great movie.DeCaprio's performance is remarkable, and Depp and the other actors put in very solid performances. The scenic wide shots are wonderful.The problem for me lied in the plot. I simply did not find it compelling enough to maintain my strong interest throughout the film, which moves at a very slow and measured pace."
3,A good story that could have been portrayed better,"This movie definitely had a very touching and captivating story as well as a great performance by DiCaprio; however, it was very slow-moving and boring. Most of the movie shows Gilbert interacting with his new girlfriend or with his retarded brother Arnie in a day-to-day manner, which makes the story much more mundane than it could have been. This is worth seeing, but it's too slow-moving to want to see more than once, which is disappointing for a movie that had such huge potential."
2,Sour Grapes,Story was long and confusing. Gilbert Grape played by Johnny Depp was moody and depressing. He seemed to be quite confused and misguided and one had to assume what he was thinking most of the time. Leonardo DiCapprio's acting was the saving grace for this movie. He had evidently studied his role of the handicapped brother and was very realistic. Would not recommend this unless you have nothing else to do on a rainy afternoon.
2,Watchable,"Fine acting, fine performances, in a realistic enough setting. But the writers forgot to make me care about these people. I watched half and then gave up."
2,It was a great move....but...,"I thought this movie had a great story line. But it just wasn't one of those movies that you could really get into. Nothing exciting ever seemed to happen, it wasn't a movie that made me wanna reach out, or cry over. I just sat there stunned at the idea of how poor this movie was. My friends also saw it, they thought it was a good movie with good actors, i just found it depressingly boring expcially for starring Jonny Depp and Leo..."
5,Great Movie!!!,A wonderful family movie. Leonardo Dicaprio does an amazing job as Arnie! We fell in love with him. Very heart warming. We have watched it several times. Highly recomended.
5,No Disappointment Here!,"From the beginning of this movie, I was drawn into the very realistic story and kept there by the sensitive portrayals of Gilbert (Johnny Depp) and his young brother (Leonardo diCaprio). My interest was completely held and my admiration for the acting ability of Johnny Depp and Leonardo diCaprio, such youngsters here. Just look at their ability even then! Is anyone surprised that these two are where they are today?For me, an actor is successful when you totally forget that what you're seeing is a movie, not real life. What I was seeing, made me more sensitive to the plight of people in these situations. I was right in the middle of their lives, and even though I first saw What's Eating Gilbert Grape at least 15 years ago, that story has stayed with me to this day. Consequently, when I saw Gilbert Grape offered on Amazon, I bought it quickly. I am not sorry!"
4,classic Johnny,Sensitive character gives Depp the opportunity to show earlier audiences what he can do. Teenage theme timeless.
5,Fantastic story,A young man's dedication to his overly obese mother and retarded brother. He is the sole provider for his family of six. One can learn a great deal from Gilbert Grape.
5,Brilliant - Leo is amazing,"What a great movie. I can see it over and over again. Everyone in the cast is excellent but Leonardo is just so amazing. How does someone so young get such insight into portraying someone totally different from him without making him a caricature? I shouldn't be surprised though - every movie he's been in, he's totally believable. There are many actors who are good looking. What separates Leo from the others is he's not just a pretty face - he's got the talent to match. END"
5,WOW !!!!,This Movie Just Goes To Show That He Can Take Any Role And Do The Best Job On It !! This movie was so good i loved it ! It made me laugh and cry ! It is amazing how good leo acts in this movie. He is the best actor ! ! Not only is he a good actor but way HOTT !!!!! END
5,"Passionate acting, strong story, great movie!","This is an outstanding movie, astounding casting for this movie, Johnny Depp isn't the only good actor in this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio gives his only good performance, in my opinion. I love the non-fairy tale story line in this movie. This movie is deffinately on my top 3 favorite movies of all time. The acting is so realistic in this movie, you can feel the pain & drama in this film. You must see this movie, it's an essential. Don't rent it first, buy it, it will please you GUARANTEED."
3,Life is a journey,"Gilbert Grape is another devoted family member. But his family is in dispair. His pretty mum is now a hideous ogre. She has not set her foot out the house for years and the family accepts it. Instead of her being the mother, she is the old exhausted grandmother being helped by her family members. Then their is an imbecile brother. He mentally ill and needs constant attention. He is a burden, but heis Gildbert's brother. He was expected to die at the age of 10, will he live to be 20 and will Gilbert let the love of his life go? Will his mother start taking care of herself or will she die from high cholestral?This movie will keep you guessing to the end. We see a young adult who just drifts along in life, accepting. Will he take action?"
5,Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance!,"I was kinda leary of watching it because of the title. But as anyone knows, you can't judge a movie by it's name. So I sat down and watchd it and I thought that was the most touching movie I have seen in a long time. Leonardo DiCaprio was a pro in his role."
3,Fantastic acting by a young DiCaprio,"This is the heartfelt story about Gilbert Grape's (Johnny Depp) boring yet challenged life in a small town on the far side.He has to take care of his retarded brother, played amazingly good by a young pre-fame Leonardo DiCaprio, of his whale-sized mother, of a grocery store on its way to give in to the modern hypermarket, of the sexual lusts of a married woman...Then, one day, a girl (Juliette Lewis) accidently comes to town. A girl so much different from Gilbert Grape's daily universe..."
4,Not bad,"First, I am happy for timed delivery.Also I am satisfied for cheep price and good condition for the item."
3,We don't know for sure what's eating him...,"This is another one of my slow-moving, quirky movies that I tend to enjoy. The family portrayed in this film seems quite realistic, although I can't relate to them. The family comes together as a loving unit because of all of their troubles. They love their obese mother, who is stuck in the house due to her condition, and appreciate all that they have because of their difficult lives.Usually, I don't like Leonardo Di Caprio, but he was fantastic in his role as the mentally handicapped younger brother.I guess you have to be a little patient to appreciate this simple, yet thought-provoking movie, but if you liked Benny and Joon, you'll like this... perhaps."
4,Man is his mum FAT!,"I just want to say that Gilbert's mum is HUGE, and apparently that's all her, like no padding and stuff, so she's one brave FAT chic! I think DiCaprio put in a very talented performance, as it must be hugely difficult to act like that if your not kinda thing. i think it's really sad when Becky leaves, but it's really cool when she comes back!"
3,Gilbert Grape,"the video looks to be stolen from blockbuster and I was under the impression that it was going to be a used video that was purchase legally. the case does not close which is rather annoying. the dvd is ok though, nothing wrong with the picture of anything."
5,Good Movie,"I have to admit, I only bought this because I was interested in it due to American Dad. That and Family guy are shows that sometimes portray movies.... and the squirrel scene made me wonder if it was a movie so I looked it up. Was even more interested when I saw that Johnny Depp and Leonardo Dicaprio were in it.Watched it nonstop the first time. Which I only say because I started it around midnight, had classes the next morning, but started being pulled into the movie so much that I had to finish it.Depp really shows how great of an actor he is in this movie, DiCaprio as well.The movie almost seems rather simple if you think about it. Maybe I've just seen so many action/thriller type movies. I definitely loved it."
5,Goodnights L-XL,"These are the best pullups for my heavy bedwetter. It is difficult to find these in size L-XL in my local brick & mortar stores, and this is a better deal anyway."
5,MY FAVORITE OLD SCHOOL HIP HOP ALBUM,"I bought this CD the day it came out and have always wondered what happened to Tone Loc, apart from showing up in a few Hollyweird movies. This is a great album with great beats , funny lyrics and good fun. Fave track is 'Mean Green'. Maybe I've been Loced after dark but I still think this is a great album."
2,Cool Hand Loc,"This CD is very different from the upbeat rap of his first CD. Its bluesy/jazzy. I preferred his first CD much more. But if you want a soft style, this one might be for you."
3,Made in Taiwan,"I just received my order for Amazon's spindle of 30 Fujifilm CD-R's and they were the lesser quality ""Made In Taiwan"" ones. Just wanted to pass this along in case you were expecting Taiyo Yuden."
5,30- Pack Spindle,"In case anyone is curious, (being how the last comment on these Fujifilm CD-R's was 20 months ago), my recent order for Amazon's spindle of 30 Fujifilm CD-R's I just received today were in fact the higher quality ""Made In Japan"" ones, and not the ""Made In Taiwan"" ones (order at your own risk though). Amazon also has a link on the left side of this page called ""Buy The Best CD-R Media You Can Get"", which is an article on various CD-R's, and recommends these Fuji's. CompUSA actually shipped these out for Amazon, but my local CompUSA store here in San Diego didn't even stock `em for some reason. The CD fronts have a standard ""frosted silver"" finish to them, and look very sharp. Plus, they are rated at ""up to 48x burn speed"", and not 24x, as the ""outdated"" item description suggests."
3,Caution: Taiwanese version!,"Ordered May 12, 2008 from Amazon, not Marketplace seller. The picture of the product is wrong; not what I received. The picture is of the Japanese version of these Fuji CD's; what I received were the Taiwanese version that everyone hates and which are less than 1/2 as reliable. Disappointed."
5,These are the best CD-Rs I've dealt with,"I've encountered a number of brands of CD-Rs that are of poor quality, resulting in burned CDs that have pops and skips in them, no matter what CD player I use. After wasting several hours checking my machine's hardware, I decided to try some different discs and ended up buying these Fuji CD-Rs (from a local store) and have encountered zero problems since then.Not only are my burned CDs clean, without any pops nor skips, but there is also a noticable difference in sound quality, with the Fuji discs being much richer than other brands I've used.Unlike others on here, the ones I bought are in fact manufactured in Taiwan instead of Japan, but I haven't had any problems with them as some other older reviews seem to suggest.All in all, a great product."
3,Go with the Memorex black cd-r's instead.,"Nice thing about these discs is that they're very inexpensive, and there are almost never any errors. Problem though is that they are too suseptable to damage. If your cds are prone to any sort of wear and tear, you're much better off with the Memorex's. They cost a bit more, but they're sturdier and that's worth the money."
3,"""Not Virgil's Best""","The warm and friendly poet from Mantua, Publius Virgilius Maro, in his didactic poem entitled the ""Georgics,"" covers topics relating to farming: in book one he deals with crops, in book two trees and shrubs, in book three livestock, and in book four bees. While several scholars have regarded this work as one of the best Latin poems ever, it must be taken into account that it is, nevertheless, far less entertaining than his famous ""Aenied,"" and much more difficult to read. At times, in the ""Georgics,"" Virgil echoes with that same brilliance many people have come to love in the ""Aenied."" But for the most part, this poem may be rigorous for anyone not serious about Roman poetry, so it is not recommended for everyone. In context of Virgil's time, this poem easily gets five stars, but the many archaisms found in it tend to alienate modern readers, and so, with much hesitation, the poem receives only three."
2,Japanese knives made in China?,"I think claims like these would have gotten the two countries into war in the old, old days.""Finest Japanese blade steel"" on all the knives... but, on the box there is a clear plastic label that says (hold your breath) ""Made in China.""I think Amazon should make it clear just where these are from. I think they are good knives... and I bought the five piece set for $60 on the Gold Box deal. No doubt they are worth that much... but, more? I don't know..."
1,Poor Quality,"I bought it for 59.00 on the gold box deal and it arrived yesterday. I returned the product. very poor quality, poor finish, dull right out of the box.stay away from this one"
1,Very dull knives. I returned them.,"I thought these would be great for myself and if so, I was planning on ordering a set for my friend's wedding present. They arrived, and they were dull and the handles are not very comfortable. The magnetic strip was cool, but overall they are rated low by everyone else on this site because they are right!!! I returned them."
4,Incredible value!,"I must admit I was hesitant to click on ""Buy"", after reading the reviews about how dull these knives are. Do people know how to sharpen a knife? The set came in faster than I expected, well packaged and ready to use. I sharpened the knives (as one should always do) and started to use them. What a surprise! They are well balanced, nice and heavy and incredibly sharp. I can't believe anyone would ever say these are not good knives. And at that price? I should have bought two sets! Buy them while they last!!!"
2,"Merely OK, standard Made in China kitchen knives.","First of all, this ""Handmade from finest Japanese Blade Steel"" is misleading, these are made in China like most other cheap knives.The edges from the factory are terrible. If you don't know how to sharpen a knife, these will displease you greatly.After I sharpened them, they cut fine, but I find the ergonomics to be poor, and can't get into the rhythm I normally do. I find the ""thumb divot"" to be useless and unsightly.These knives are trying to be Global knives. They are worth the $50 price for the set, but only when you fully realize that you're not getting high quality. I'm a bit surprised at Bodum for putting these out under their brand."
2,Not very sharp.,I bought the 5-piece set as well. They definitely are not as sharp as professional quality knives. At least they look good.
5,Everybody at home like it.,This a real roots reggae but not only: Everyone who just aprreciate reggae canlisten it 2 Hours. You talk about easylistening ? I've just said real good stuff !
5,good bye godzilla,i grew up watching this movie yeah it had cheese cut ins with raymond burr but you have to remeber this was going to be the last godzilla movie the first movie i every cried at if you only see one godzilla movie see this or the orginal one
2,A disappointing new beginning,"I wasn't happy with this movie. It lacked what Biolante had. The movie was basically boring. Godzilla wasn't shown that much in the movie and the special effects were bad. Even Godzilla's suit looked terrible. Toho tried to make it similar to the original Godzilla, but they couldn't. Even with Raymond Burr in the movie didn't do much for it. If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't bother renting it. You'll get bored pretty quickly."
3,godzilla 1985,"godzilla becomes evil once again in this updated version of the 1954 classic. godzilla is bigger since his last appearnce, although only the first film is mentioned. the movies that followed are ignored. colorful special effects but godzilla didn't excite too much this time around, he wasn't as destructive here as in the origanal, but still okay. best parts are godzilla going against the super x."
5,COOL!!!!!!,"The absolute best G-movie. I liked the bum who got stepped on. Poor bum. I have seen it about 50+ times. The Super X rocked. If you haven't seen it just stop reading this and go order it, NOW!!!"
5,A great long overdue sequel to the original,"I have a soft spot for this movie since I was fortunate enough to see it in the movie theater and have some fond memories. I thought this was a long overdue sequel to the first Godzilla and returned the series to its serious roots, not that some of the other films werent good, they just didnt have that same feel. Yes Raymond Burrs scenes were shot cheaply. HOWEVER, he adds depth, authority and drama to the movie, and his return was quite inspired. The effects are good and the plot has some neat twitsts. If you are new to Godzilla I suggest you watch the original King of The Monsters movie and then this sequel, lots of fun, buy it!"
4,Good Movie,A real good movie with good special effects for 1985. Raymond Burr's second appearance since '54 was good too.
2,Nothing like the classic,"This the first entry of the new series and I was pretty disgusted. For the first time since the first movie, Godzilla destroyed Tokyo without fighting a enemy. The Japanese version was good and had a more serious tone to it. The cheap American version had scenes put in with Burr and a couple U.S. Generals and officers. Don't get me wrong, I like Raymond Burr, But those weird officers, drinking their Dr. Pepper, are what almost killed the American version. The new Godzilla looked good and I liked the added dorsal plates on his back. His face looked funny though, his top lip was gigantic and those fangs were too big. The only good thing about the American version is Burr's little speech at the end, something the Japanese didn't have. Overall a o.k. movie with good action scenes and a pretty creative ending. END"
2,A travesty!,"What a hatchet job!! Once again, the Big G suffers at the hands of his American distributor. A lot of material has been deleted to make room for goofy scenes of Raymond Burr and Dr. Pepper sipping military officers. These scenes are pointless, irritating, and detract from an otherwise serious film. The humor will invoke the ""nails-on-chalkboard"" principle for anyone over five-years-old and, of course, the dubbing is hideous(Contrary to popular belief, this is NOT the fault of the Japanese filmmakers!!!!!). An absolute travesty that deserves to be watched for the excellent Godzilla effects and nothing else! You have been warned!! END"
2,Ouch,"There's not a lot to say about this movie except that the music is bad, the Godzilla costume is sad, his roar is terrible, and the story stinks."
5,Great New Era,"This movie is the first of the ""revamped"" Godzilla movies. Raymond Burr picks up 30 yrs later where he left off as American reporter Steve Martin in Godzilla King of the Monsters. The FX in this movie are very good and the ""new"" Godzilla looks great. This is a breath of fresh air for Godzilla fans. Russia, the U.S. and of course Japan join forces to try and stop the destruction of...you guessed it Tokyo. Great movie."
5,Godzilla destroyes Japan once more.,Godzilla against Japans army.No Oxygen Destroyer this time.Get this movie if you want to know how Japan gets rid of him this time. Movie #16 of 23.
2,Godzilla Vs Dr Pepper,"Intended as an alternative sequel to the original 'King of Monsters', this returned the Big G to the screen after ten years.And what on earth have western distributors done to it? The editing is just terrible - there are extended scenes of Godzilla just standing about, and the whole thing seems to run out of steam halfway through. Added into the movie are badly-inserted appearances by Raymond Burr, right-wing propaganda and some truly laughable scenes of military types swigging cans of Dr Pepper.This film gets two stars as it is at least better than the dreadful 1998 so-called Godzilla film."
2,This is it?,"Godzilla's costume stinks, he barely attacks, and the actors stink. The movie was a failure, but nice effects for its time."
2,Awsome-Looking Godzilla but............,"Godzilla doesn't do much but breath fire. Also, what's with the bugs? They don't do much. The plot is ""Godzilla returns and raids Japan after 30 years"", thats good, but listen to this,""most of the time, he's following BIRDS!"" mostly he just walks. The plot also is the biggest drag-on in the series. I gave it two stars because of the amazing ending, Ramond Burr returns and Godzilla looks great."
4,perfect for my cubicle,"I don't have much space at my office for picture frames, but I have a locker and file cabinet next to my desk. These work perfectly."
4,Best Upstart Album,"The Upstarts have been around for a whyle now, i think 1979-1987. Roumor has it that they have reunited due to money needs. This is the Upstarts 3rd studio album, and its a good album, not as dynamic as reason why, but more catchy than Teenage Warning (dont worry you probably wont be able to find a copy of it anyway) but an all around good album. Favorite tracks: Never ad Nothin, Police Oppression, Shotgun Solution Ronnie is a Rocker, and Out of Control. Buy this album if you are interested in political punk from the early 80s era. Not a bad album, but in my opinion, spend your money on bands like Gang of Four, The Fall, husker Du, etc. Theres a reason why they havent lasted the test of time, but then again neither did Wire..."
2,Big Sticker on Cover,"Everything was as expected except there was a big, round, black sticker on the cover, covering the title that said ""Save On Used Books"". I know it is a used book. I have no problem with putting on a sticker but at least either make it smaller or put it on the back."
1,Teachers should not use this book!,"The book, although it gives a valiant effort in promoting new approaches to chemistry, is a poorly put together piece of work. The appendix is oddly organized and the format of the problems is jumbled into a mess that leaves one feeling frustrated instead of inspired. As a chemistry lover, this book was a HUGE disappointment."
4,A little bit of everything.,"This collection of 24 cuts by different artists gives the listener an idea of how varied and interesting the roots of alt. country are. (Is it just me or is alt. country a truly dumb name. Just checking.)Songs from many artists; vets like Johnny Cash,(The true father of this style of music and so much more)and Steve Earle (""Guitar Town"")to ""newer"" bands like BRS-49 (With their wonderful tribute to Bettie Page, a pin-up queen of the 50's)are mixed together with no real concept behind it. (Typical K-Tel) But as another reviewer explained it, this is not for fans of the genre, it's for new entrants, like me, who want to check out what this sound is about. I've definitely heard a few things here that make me want to pursue some of these artists'other recordings. A nice sampler and while maybe there are omissions, for an overview this one is not bad, a nice mix of songs and styles."
2,Only buy this if you want basic building information.,"This books has actual construction as the focus. It will teach you how to layout and build floors, walls, etc. The segments on design and layout are very weak."
4,Very original jazz arrangements of Jerome Kern Standards,The title is misleading. This is a very solid jazz album in my opinion. Very good personell.
1,We used to call this a garage band,"I don't get it! This is not a tribute unless you call a garage band, who tries to copy Heart a Heart tribute. The problem is why? Buy the real thing! I'm a singer and I believe a pretty good one, but there is no way I would ever copy Ann Wilson. You can't and get any positive feedback. Any singer knows that. Again, my opinion and question WHY??? Save your money folks and buy the real thing not a copy band. Sorry copy band come up with originals."
2,Batteries Suck,"Have one of these sets that I bought for less than $50, complete with a jigsaw, flashlight, drill etc. One battery and it now won't take a charge. So what should I do with all these tools? Can't find anyone on the internet with a replacement battery, either."
1,If JLo sux... this is worst...,"I want to know who sing the songs of this label!... They have tributes to Avril Lavigne, Britney Spears and Eminem!... LOL...Getting money easy? uhh..."
2,Watch porn instead,Save yourself some money and watch some pornographic videos instead. What you'll find:-Some of these positions aren't possible unless you are circus people-Some of these positions aren't possible unless you are Rambo with a 90 pound girlfriend-Tons of the positions look like EXACT copies of one anotherAll in all I would say a waste of money.
2,More of a source of entertainment then practical,"This book had some possible positions, but it also has some that are impossibly. I bought this as a gift for my husband, and we have not used it at all. Absolute waste of money."
3,Its alright,"We will use these every now and then to surprise ourselves with something we havent tried in a while. Other than that, there really isnt anything real genius about it. You can use it like a deck of cards and draw one out and make sure to use that position during your next go-around. There are several in the deck that are absolutely impossible and I would be even afraid to try."
1,Position Of The Day Playbook: Sex Every Day In Every Way,Don't waste your money. The illustrations are vague and there are no instructions. Most of the 'positions' could only be acheived by competitive gymnasts and that is doubtful knowing anatomical limitations. Just because you give one position two names doesn't make it two positions.
5,exploring the struggle we all face,probably one of the best films ever made and one of the most underrated. I saw it first on its release and have seen it more times than I care to remember since. It took more than one viewing for me to appreciate its true genius. Alan Parker has captured the ominous mood to perfection. Mickey Rourke is the perfect choice for 'Harry Angel' (Why oh why did he abandon Hollywood??) and De'Niro gives another classic performance. Want a journey into your own 'dark side' then watch this film. Not for the faint hearted. Its no surprise this film is now gaining the recognition it deserves. Why so long I have no idea. Probably because it didn't fit into the brainless 80's 'Arnie and Stallone' action flick mould
3,Good Mickey Rourke movie - Lisa Bonet not too bad,"Dispite the promise from the seller that the version he had was the unrated version, once it was received, it turned out to be the same ""R"" rated version everyone else had. I contacted him, and he said he would check his stock, since, as he said, if there are two versions available, he ALWAYS orders the ""unrated"" one. As it turned out, his entire stock was the ""R"" rated version. He told me to keep the copy he sent ""for my troubles"", and would have a refund issued immediately...which he did. While I would still have preferd to have the ""unrated"" version of the movie, the ""R"" rated version is still QUITE good, and I would give it a fairly good recomendation to anyone interested in seeing Mickey Rourke in one of his more unusual, yet still very good, performances."
3,Charlotte Rampling never won an Academy Award,"I always wondered why? She is terrific. Robert DeNiro I like but always thought he was over rated. Mickey Rourke is dirty and adorable as usual but I wish he'd speak clearer (he mumbles his lines.) This movie was part detective, part noir ,part occult, and very humid New Orleans. I enjoyed it, but it has to be watched more than once or twice."
5,An Oldie But Goodie,"Saw this controversial film when it first came out and to watch it again 25+ years later ... it's still riveting. With Alan Parker directing talent like Rourke, DeNiro, Bonet, etc., mix in the supernatural, voo-doo, and consummate evil and set it in New Orleans ... well, how could it miss??!! Glad to have it in my collection."
4,"Excellent movie, pretty good shape.","This is one of the best unsung movies to come out of Hollywood. Mickey Rourke and Robert DeNiro at their best. Got a little scare when the DVD stalled and we had to restart it, but it worked the second time."
4,ESPECIALLY CHILLING WHEN THE END REVEALS THE TRUTH,"Very well done. All the actors are very good, But Mickey Rourke is especially a stand out in this cast. He shines in this one. A combination HORROR/NOIR that will keep your attention and not ""miss a beat."" The special features have a very interesting current day interview with Mickey Rourke. Interesting time lines and locations. EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED!!"
5,two thumbnails up,"I am rating this movie simply for volume (there were only three other reviews). ""Angel Heart"" is a dandy. There's really no other movie quite like it."
5,EXOTIC GOTHIC MASTERPIECE,"Alan Parker creates a classic film noir mystery that morphs into a gothic nightmare in slow and subtle ways. Rourke plays a private detective, Harry Angel, hired by a cryptic clent (De Niro) to track down someone whom he claims owes a debt to him. As Angel follow this person's trail through New Orleans his world starts to unravel around him. He starts to experience strange and frightening visions and finds himself involved in the local murder investigations of people whom he interviewed trying to track down his mark.Jazz... Voodoo... Atmosphere. Alan Parker is meticulous and deliberate about every aspect of this film's composition. Beautiful cinematography and a great cast round out this incredible thriller."
3,A DARK THRILLER WITH A GOOD STORY.,"""Angel Heart"" is a thriller with reminiscences of a Film Noir and an erotic mystery. Although the main character is adequately played by the usually mediocre Mickey Rourke, the highlights in ""Angel Heart"" are the performance from the great Robert De Niro as the mysterious Louis Cypher and the script and the direction of Alan Parker.Alan Parker is a director that usually is daring and innovator, perhaps his style is not pleasant to everybody, but you got to give him credit for being a daring director. As he did previously with ""Pink Floyd: The Wall"", Parker creates a dark and decadent atmosphere in ""Angel Heart"".Maybe ""Angel Heart"" is not one of the finest thrillers, but it is a daring movie with a good plot."
5,Excellent despite the warts,"As far as film making goes, there was not a great deal of attention to detail in this one. Look for modern-era cars in the 1955 street. There was no Mickey Mouse club ('Wednesday is ""Anything-can-happen Day""') when this story took place. In spite of this, the movie is one of the best, if not THE best, ""Devil"" pics around."
4,"Great Dvd, but.........","I admit picture and sound are exemplary but could someone outthere please clarify and or confirm a serious problem that Ihave with my disc. Immediately following the director's creditas the camera is moving out of the dark alleyway onto the busydowntown N.Y. street filled with traffic the picture stops or""pauses"" for a few seconds before moving forward. Has anyoneelse encountered this problem? Help! please let me know as thisis a major debit for this film fan!"
3,Unpleasant Film You Might Find Intriguiing,"Mickey Rourke does a fine job making a P.I. look like an amoral thug. DeNiro supports as a client beyond reproach with a somewhat aloof demeanor. There is murder, mayhem, voodooism, blood-letting, cannibalism, incest, brutality, and assorted other barbarisms. It does what it sets out to do rather successfully. You might find the foregoing colorfully filmed acts artfully accomplished and intriguing to experience as necessary fulfillment of the creative staffs concept. You might find them off-putting and good reason to eject the disc. In any case, be aware that this is not Sam Spade, the Thin Man or Marlowe."
5,The Best,"This has to be one of the finest movies ever made! Not only does it look fantastic (Alan Parker at his best) but it has the characterisation and story to complement it. The music is suitably atmospheric, and the art direction clostophobically creepy (exactly as is imagined in the book). The best British directed film made in America (close competition provided by American Beauty - Sam Mendes) ever! If anybody disagrees - their wrong. No question."
3,Blu-ray Review,"This is a review of the Blu-ray disc, not the movie. Compared to the Special Edition DVD released a few years back, this Blu-ray release is disappointing. I don't notice virtually any difference in video quality, the audio quality is noticeably improved, but not a deal-maker, and some significant extra features found on the DVD are not here on the Blu-ray, specifically a 5-part documentary on the subject of voodoo. There's no excuse for this, as the DVD was a single disc release and therefore there is plenty of room on Blu-ray to hold the same stuff."
4,It will leave you stunned! Rourke and De niro are Brilliant.,"Being a huge Fan of the stars Mickey and Robert, I knew I'd enjoy watching this but I enjoyed it for an entirely different reason.. The brilliantly dark script. This film is not very eager to please, it is as if it is purposely trying to weed out it's less interested audience. It has a slow pace, but at the same time it keeps you very interested by making you feel like there is always something around the corner. I has a wonderful ending that you simply can't see coming and (of course) the acting is supurb. P.S. Anyone who doubts Mickey Rourke as an Actor should see this film."
4,Byzantine,"I hated this when I saw it years ago. On second viewing last weekend, I found it much more fascinating then I had realized, even more imaginative than I had recognized. It is not a film to make one enjoy it or to feel ""good"" or ""happy"" since the plot is unpleasant, the characters pretty much reprhesible; but the exceptional acting by Rourke and DeNiro...Ah!!!!!!!!! Even Lisa Bonet seemed better in the second viewing. It was worth the two viewings; maybe a third down the road a piece. And the ending...well, evil is punished as it should be, but so are the innocent. How true to life that sometimes is."
3,"Worth a try, but don't raise your hopes too high","Yes, the film conveys the atmosphere of the early 1950s quite well, and the plot unfolds nicely enough. But all the rats in gutters and the constant rainfall in New Orleans seem a bit overdone, not to mention the blood dripping from a ceiling for no apparent reason. Why is it that Mickey Rourke often seems to be parodying rather than acting his character parts? Robert de Niro does his best to avoid parody in playing the devil, but in the end the essential frivolousness of the storyline defeats even him."
2,Skip it.,"Skip this horrible piece of dreck. Not scary, just plain stupid. Along with a few other select actors/directors, De Niro is one whose work I never miss because I know that, no matter what dreadful flaws a movie might have, his performance alone will be worth watching.Unless you're a die-hard Rourke or De Niro fan, then this will be a colossal waste of your time and money. The only reason it even did as well as it did in theatres is because of the De Niro/Rourke name power and the fact that you get to see a naked Cosby kid. Whoopee."
2,Now there are better vodoo movies like Skeleton Key,"I bought this movie for two reasons. Robert de niro and its excellent reviews. But in the entire movie Robert de niro has only 3 or 4 appearances which was very disappointing. Beside that i think may be the movie was one of its kind back then, but now there are lot better vodoo movies than Angel Heart. Two stars for Mickey Rourke. He is awesome. Rent it but don't buy it."
4,Good movie,"Robert De Nero and Micky Rourke? How can you lose? Good acting, good story, and some killings. you just cant lose with this amazing duo."
5,Dark atmospheric thriller,"Mickey Rouke stars as Private Eye Harry Angel who is given a job by the mysterious Louis Cypher (Robert de Niro). His remit is to find missing singer Johnny Favourite. Unfortunately for Harry the people he is investigating for the job have a habit of being found dead after he has talked to them. Naturally this puts Harry in the frame for murder.The cinematography is first rate. Filmed for the most part in Louisiana, there is a real sense of oppression and gloom that makes for an uneasy atmosphere throughout and certainly adds to the tone of the film. Rouke is excellent as the deadbeat Harry a character that attracts and repels at the same time whilst De Niro is suitable sinister as Cypher.Alan Parker has produced a film that is part psychological thriller, part occult-horror, but always gripping."
2,More Like Unsavory Heart,"I admit that I was first taken in by the movie due to the title. Mickey Rourke (Iron Man 2, The Expendables),Robert Deniro (A Bronx Tale, Stardust, Limitless), and Lisa Bonet (The Cosby Show) performed their roles with great intensity and clear precision. The reason why I ranked it two stars is due to the fact that I felt that the plot could have included at least one to two characters that had a dominance of ""good"" in them. Additionally, the movie seemed to imply that an intentionally evil person may be unaware of what they are doing. I can understand if the character came from a background of little emotional warmth and/or affection. However, the fact that a street smart detective seemed to be ""controlled"" clashes with the idea of free will for mankind. Due to these reasons, ""Angel Heart"" would be more for those who are horror film fanatics."
1,Lacks Heart and Everything Else,"During most of the time of this supernatural thriller, Mickey Rourke`s character is looking for a missing person and in order to achieve her he must enter some dangerous and risky places. Director Alan Parker manages to create a tense mood and atmosphere in some moments, but the result is still tedious and dull, whose only non-boring parts are the long and unecessary sex scene and the obvious, poorly conceived and ridiculous ending.""Angel Heart"" is a flat, uninteresting movie that lacks in substance, entertainment, tension and credibility. A snoozer."
1,Poor Battery + Lots of Junk.....,"Hi,The Batter Performance is Poor. The salesman at Circuity City will BS to get their product sold. It hardly lasts more than 80 minutes. The Laptop is loaded with JUNK. It sux!!!!I installed Red Hat Linux 9.0 and XP Pro with SP2.Their are no Network Card Drivers for Linux, so I can easily say forget about your wireless working on Linux. Shame on both Toshiba and Intel for not supporting the same.The system cannot hibernate nor turn itself off even after installing battry saver options that accompanied the CD.So I have had a horrible experience. Pretty much whatever I want I don't get.I will never ever BUY Toshiba."
4,"Military in Iraq--do not buy Satellite M45 15.4"" Notebook--Display went out after 4 months","Purchased the Satellite M45 Dec 05 from AAFES on Military base in Kuwait. Now is Mar 06 and the backlight display has already gone out. called Toshiba customer service, had to ask for a supervisor to get a competent person. in order to get repaired, must 1] take to an ""authorized service center"" in the states or 2] they will send you a box you can ship it to them, but must pay $24 for the box. and they only partnered UPS. no UPS in Iraq and nearest repair shop in Kuwait,but not covered under ""international warranty.""know of several other service members with this type of notebook that have had display or battery problems and now out of $1Kguaranteed to have problems if you buy this. make sure to back up data everyday because you never know when display will go out."
1,Do your research,"Anyone considering a purchase of a Toshiba Satellite series computer such as the M45 should run a search on the terms Toshiba satellite overheating. My experience has been that Toshiba does not stand by its products, cannot repair the chronic problems with this series and will not extend warranties or offer replacement to customers who have endured numerous ""repairs."" The problem cited below with air circulation is well known to Toshiba sat series sufferers and to Toshiba, which has been taken to court over related issues on the 5005, do a Google. Customer service is horrid, out of the Nixon White House. The satellite series computers work well when they work. But Toshiba should be in the lemon-aide biz, not the computer biz. They do make good TVs, though."
4,"Thin, light, runs cool, but screen could be better","When I first saw this laptop it seemed perfect - great screen, thin, light, perfect keyboard, etc. But after placing it directly next to the new Sony VGN-FS550, I couldn't believe the difference. The screen on the Sony was MUCH brighter and the Sony seemed to be better built (no flex in the screen, nicer materials, better fit & finish, etc.)Pros:- TruBrite screen (better than average, but not as bright as Sony FS)- relatively thin and light considering specs- placement of speakers ABOVE keyboard rather than below on M35- great keyboard- very quiet, runs cool (if properly ventilated!), still haven't heard fan- exceptional price ($1250 online)Cons:- lots of pre-loaded and worthless software- DDR memory rather than faster DDR2 memory- slower 4200rpm hard drive- Toshiba reliability is better than average but not great- wireless performance is average"
2,Columbia knife,The knife came out of the box plenty sharp but I didn't like the serrated edge at all. It seems to catch on everything and makes filleting and skinning very difficult. Great for cutting off heads but not much else.
2,Poor Quality,"I've enjoyed my Sony multi-handset telephone system, but after a year, I found the quality to be miserable. One handset will no longer register to the base unit, and on another handset, some buttons on the keypad no longer work."
2,"Handset buttons (1,2,3) just stop working after a couple of years","I am a Sony fan but in this case I am making an exception. I completely agree with the other feedbacks regarding the buttons issue.I have been using this phone for almost 3 years and I really like the phone except when the number is not in memory or the other side asks me to push 1 for english! I just cannot get it to dial the 1, 2 or the 3 buttons."
4,Sony SPP-H273 Additional Handset,"I really like the features of this 5.4ghz phone, and the clarity is really good, however, the range isn't as good as my 900mhz spread spectrum phone."
5,A+ Buy.,"I purchased this knife after I lost my first one. Although this is not a seraded knife, it still has a strong and sharp blade. Smith and Wesson is a quality name. For guns and knifes. For 20 bucks and change, this is a must buy for anyone who carries a knife on them on a day to day basis."
5,Almost as good as being there,"This is the CD I lend to people when I want to explain why I love Sacred Harp. It has all the raw energy that I associate with Sacred Harp singing along with fine quality recording, something the early field recordings lack, of course. It contains a wide range of songs, some with large groups of singers and some with small groups of singers. I love that you can hear the feet stomping! Now that I live in Australia, with only a small band of Sacred Harp singers, listening to this is almost as good as being there."
3,A good beginning,"In this book Messrs. Evans and Wurster offer some rough-and-ready tools for those interested in this topic to apply in the real world (of course not in a cyber one). In short, the authors boil down the intricate constraints encounters by people into 2 perspectives: reach and richness. On this premise Messrs. Evans and Wurster attempt to conceptualize the world of information into a few manageable models.Easy to read but the elaborations are skin-deep. Good for beginners."
2,"A couple good ideas, that are said over and over","I bought this book because I read the authors' excellent article in Harvard Business Review. But the book simply repeats the same ideas, over and over again. This book has fewer ideas per page than any management book I can recall reading in years. Save your money and read what they wrote in HBR."
5,Sample but powerful,"I have read this book for half a year. At that time, I find this book amazing. Even though rationale: reach vs richness is simple, it hits the main points of e-business.During this 6 months, I read many other e-business books. The more I read the more I find that this is a classic and insightful capital. Other books contains no central idea but a lot of facts which requires your tremendous energy to digest. The more I read the more I come back to the simple rule: change of reach vs richness for support.If you are a thinker, this is a book for you. If you like news reporting types like New New Thing or The Internet Bubble, it is not your choice."
4,Ignore the forces outlined in this book at your peril!,"If you are looking for a discussion of the new vs old economy, this is the book for you. It outlines the forces not in terms of technology which so many e-business books are doing now but instead in a richness-reach framework which talks about customers. It explores the forces which are at work affecting established mature companies and how they must change and newer dot com companies which must evolve. This would be a good read over the holiday period to mull over and incorporate into your strategic thinking for next year."
2,"Gee, you're kidding right?","This book is surprisingly obvious. The writers tell us things we already know, they just collect it in one book and sell it. There is nothing in here you don't already know. At the end of each chapter, you're left with a strong sense of ""Well duh"". The authors throw a lot of buzzwords out and then continue to reuse them to death. If you like to read a lot of rhetoric and want the feeling of déjà vu all over again, this is your book. If you can see what's going on in the world around you, you don't need it. Thick pages and large print make this an easy read."
2,Fairly simple premise,"The premise of the book seems like old news already: the Internet is changing the dynamics of business and organizational power. The models which the authors offer are helpful, but fairly elementary for those who have read other business books or articles about the Internet.Yes, the economics of information is different from the economics of things (with physical inputs like capital, and labour) but most of the examples cited in the book are not new: Dell Computer, Charles Schwab, and Sabre on-line reservation systems.As one of the other reviewers mentioned, it is perhaps better to scan it while in a bookstore."
2,A flop,"This book tells us about the rules of the e-world. It's opportunities,threats and what you have to do to win on it. Nevertheless, it's written not in a very clear way. Some people may face some difficulties in understand its concepts. The first part Reach vs Richness is great, but the following sections fail to consolidate these ideas... This book doesn't worth the time and money for reading it."
2,Not as good as the reviews here make it out to be,"Perhaps I have read to much on the subject, but I found this book to be poorly written to the point that it was difficult to read quickly, and I thought that the subject matter was not very well backed up. I would recommend several other books on this subject before reading this one at a last resort."
2,Overated,"Although once you cut through the authors esoteric and obtuse writing style this book manages to make some good points.The weakness in this mini-tome is in its feeble attempt to create new terms and labels for the ""e"" generation. Terms like ""disintermediation"" (this word doesn't exist anywhere but in the minds of the authors) and the appellation ""navigators"" belongs more to a Star Trek scenario.The authors also seem to be unaware that we do not live in a linear world. In most of the world today, you need a ""navigator"" just to find food and avoid the violence and mayhem.Messers' Evans and Worster need to spend a little more time in the real world, not in the cloistered halls of Harvard.D W Ross"
4,Insightful but long-winded,This seeks to give a conceptual overview for what we are experiencing in the digital revolution. The authors are brave in laying out their hypotheses. They could have put more effort into trimming the fat off. It's not as crisp as the original article. But still worth a read.
4,Practical,"In my opinion, the book is a very practical guide for people designing web sites. It has quite good illustrations and explanations. And is very ""browsable"". I mean, you can easily go to the topic you are interested in.I recomend the chapter about forms."
2,Clueless?,"I looked at the sample pages, and saw fig. 1.2 giving an analysis of a website that didn't clearly identify its overall goals , etc. But the page in question was so obviously one of those 'search network' typo-url cookie-cutter sites of domain squatters. It's not a serious site, and anyone with half a clue in web marketing knows this. So even though I've no idea what the rest of the book says, I doubt the writer's judgment and current state of knowledge. I mean, if he can't spot a squatter spam site, what else is he oblivious to?"
4,Web bloopers,"I'm not a web developer. I haven't done much since I installedthe first American web server back in December 1991. But I wascurious about the bloopers anyway so read the book. I really enjoyed reading the book. Some of the bloopers Jeff has found are down right funny. Others are sutle and easy to ame, but others are obvious, and it is amazing that they are done so often."
3,Other usability books are better,"I found this book to be a bit lacking. I have read most of the usability books on the market, and this book did not cover anything new. The author did not go into the science behind the bloopers and does not cite any studies that were conducted. Rather, he uses pictures to back up each blooper. The book is 60-70% pictures. The layout of the book made it hard to read, since the pictures constantly interrupted the text flow.You can find the list of bloopers on the author's Web site and I do not think this book adds much additional value, since most experienced Web developers have already seen examples of each blooper. You can find better descriptions of usability problems by doing a Web search. This book would be appropriate for a new Web designer/developer, or someone who has not already read much about usability.In conclusion, most Web developers would be better off with the book Don't Make Me Think, a Jakob Nielsen book, or an Information Architecture book."
3,By Now Outdated,"This book is rather outdated. Web design has made leaps and bounds since it was published. However some basic principles still apply, as they always will."
5,Great Unconventional Dark Drama Series,"If you are reading this, you probably know all about the series. It is a great unconventional drama series with some dark plots following the likes of the X-Files. So I will just review the DVD set. It comes in a box with 9 slim DVD cases, each with 2 DVDs for a total of 18 discs. Each season consists of 3 of the slim DVD cases and 6 total discs.Season 1 is full screen (1.33:1) and Season 2 is widescreen (1.78:1). The product page had only listed full screen, but it is because season 1 is full screen, even when you purchase seasons as separate sets. I was very happy to see the widescreen versions in the set.Arrived in perfect condition for me, no loose or scratched discs as can happen in some poorly packaged DVD sets."
3,Glen Morgan and James Wong should have been fired!,"Show started off great in season one, which was primarily written by Chris Carter. Season two, written by James Wong and Glen Morgan was just stupid and completely ruined the rest of the series bringing it to an abrupt end in season three and never even making it to the millenium!"
3,Millennium Series review,"Although I have never seen this television series before, it came highly recommended. I won't get into the detail of the storyline because that is a matter of personal preference. I will however talk about the condition of the DVD's themselves. I did buy the series in it's entirety twice and, for some unknown reason, had to send the first set back because the DVD would freeze up on a specific scene in the first set. So, I sent the entire series back, and reordered a second set at which was sent to me. Unbelieveably, the same thing happened on the second set! I don't know why, even took my DVD player in for a look-see, but there was nothing wrong (I did not know that blu-rays have to be updated). When they tried to play that scene at the shop, it worked on one player but not on another. So, to this day, I have not been able to view that specific story or the one right after that. Stranger than fiction."
3,Two writers?,The first season is great with a good plot and twists and turns you'd expect. But the second and third have several episodes that seem to have been written by a different writer. They are silly and boring and make no sense whatsoever.
2,Slow moving and plots are full of holes,"Especially in season 1, much time is wasted with Frank exchanging soulful looks with his wife. Frank has ""visions"" so the writors don't have to bother with things like evidence or clues. Every episode has the same feel, dark and brooding. If you have any sunshine in your room you won't see a thing. Frank shows just one emotion, anger. The rest of the time he's lifeless. And the daughter is too perfect. I kept hoping she would have a temper tantrum."
3,Whats New Here? Nathing Special on the box?,"Iam a big fan of millennium, I have the 3 seasons box, and are great, the design, the menus, the subtitles, all are great, so whats the special on this box? Blue Ray? any special bonus disc? I dont see any special box just a simple box, If I buy its just for collector, but I dont see any reason for buy this..."
5,Fast Delivery,"I ordered this as a birthday present for my husband. He is a huge fan of x-files, and is very excited about this series. He is still on season one, but so far he loves it."
5,Don't miss this...,"This is simply the best TV series ever produced. With Frank Black, Lance Henriksen created his masterpiece. MILLENNIUM was the only serious meditation on good/evil and hope/despair to address our present historic moment. You owe it to yourself to see these amazing stories."
5,"Good product, fare price",I'm not crazy about ironing - who is? But this steam iron makes it pretty easy. My main concern when I ordered was the weight. But it is not heavy. It's very comfortable to handle. It does a good job. And it has a great design!
3,Old habits are hard to break,"Maybe I'm just too used to my old iron with the dial you could turn to the exact temperature. I've scorched more shirts with this one! I've finally quit ironing white shirts all together. You get three temp settings. On One , you can iron butter and not melt it. On two, it gets hotter, but no steam...use a spritzer bottle. On three....IRON FAST cause now you have steam, but it scorches fast! I guess I just miss the good old days and the ""not so smart"" appliances."
5,"Excellent, moderatly priced center speaker","I had a cheap center speaker by another manufacturer. I replaced it with this Polk model and it made a significant difference. Voices are much more discernibly. We are no longer replaying scenes after asking: ""What did they say??"" In addition to the improvement in the dialogue quality, this speaker significantly increased the quality of the other sound and music. It really gave our home theater system a boost in quality. I've read that the center channel speaker may be the most important part of your home theater set-up and is actually where most of the sound comes from. After upgrading to the Polk, I have to agree. I wish that I hadn't skimped when I bought my first one.If you looking for an excellent center speaker, that is moderatly priced, consider this Polk model."
4,Something Different,"I describe this as a ""European-flavored modern jazz."" The ideas are well conceived and the playing is well executed. I bought this in the fall of 2001 and I'm still listening to it regularly. If you like modern jazz with a touch of new age, you will like this."
1,Frustration Personified!!!,"This is the third algebra class I've taken and I received an A on my other two classes. Using this textbook, I'll be fortunate to pass. The problems are not explained well, there are not examples for every type of problem, the review problems and test at the end of each chapter do not having the corresponding section from which they were taken. The way the authors explain problems are different from what I was taught before. Given a choice, I would not buy this textbook. I have to go to my intermediate text by a different author and even that doesn't help much."
2,Not for me,The product was delivered in good condition and in the time frame advertised. I tried it for several weeks following the directions but did not like the way it made me feel. It's just not what I want/need.
1,Pointless product,Waste of money. This product did nothing and was over $30. If you like NO2 supplements look elsewhere. Too much money + no noticeable effects = Bad product
3,Marsh Foot,"Nice concept but it doesn't lock on the Avery pole like it should. In fact I had to use my drill press to drill a hole through it and the pole and use a bolt and lock nut to secure it to the pole. 1st time i tried using the marsh foot with the pole, the marsh foot kept pulling right off the pole. Avery makes pretty good products but this is something they need to look at and fix and instead of selling seperate they should sell the pole and marsh foot as a package."
4,Everything but the color,"My wonderful Gateway Solo 1150 finally gave up and the repair shop offered the Presario C301NR for $499, just $200 more than the repairs would have been.The wider keyboard is a bit of a stretch if you have small hands. But my main complaint is with the color. The blues are fairly true, but the FFCC00 is actually orange instead of yellow. Disappointing because I use that color throughout my website, often coordinating the print with particular photographs.Color really matters to me but I am loath to change it on my site as all the Gateways, Toshibas, Dell and Macs I have checked out show the correct hues.For the price and all the features, this is a fine laptop."
2,Item sent was not the one in the picture,I like the Playtex insulated cups but I did not receive the cup that was pictured online. (I wanted the one with the planets and dinosaurs but received two with sports.) Now I must return it!
1,COLOR CAUTION!,"There is no way to know what color combo on these cups you will receive. I received all pink cups eventhough they have blue and purple pictured. I would not order these cups online again, buy them at Target instead."
1,Dangerous Cup.,"This cup has been excellent so far from utility point of view. However, today my son fell while playing and chipped his front tooth because of the cup. The cup lid is far too hard for a baby's teeth. So be careful before buying. I would recommend a softer cup that may not last this long but is safe for the kid."
3,Wish you could pick the colors!!,"After reading numerous reviews I decided to order these cups because I was hoping to actually receive the pink ones...instead I received boy sports theme so they are being returned. I do believe these are the best non-leaking sippy cups out there, but I really wish we had a choice in the color! Why is it so hard for Amazon to do Boy or Girl on these types of items??"
3,I wish it was the complete season...,"Now i haven't actually bought this yet, but i have seen the whole series, and i'm hesitant on buying this for one reason....they're so expensive!! I remember buying the COMPLETE first season for the same price just ONE of these volumes (and there are four volumes in total) costs. Although i would like to hurry and complete the series, i don't want to spend 30 bucks a pop for each volume, i wish they would just release a ""Code Geass R2 the complete second season"" or something."
5,Functional MP3 Player case,This is a very useful mp3 player case. You will need to purchase the silicone case so you can easily fasten it to your clothing for jogging or walking.
4,MP3 Handler With Care,"If there is one popular company that does a excellent job at making the best MP3 players on the market, Sandisk is that one. Their Sansa MP3 players work great, but they unfortunately miss out on having a good quality case when you buy the player. This silicone case for their M200 series is sleek and convient. It works great with the M230 512 MB, M240 1 GB and M250 2 GB players. It clips on to your clothes, and you can use it well to help you take along your Sansa with you. I absolutely recommend this as a great add-on if you own the Sansa M200 series players from Sandisk. It really drags along nicely to playback, without any skipping.Price: BConvience: B 1/2+Overall: B 1/2+"
1,Save your money,"I was a little surprised by the design when I received the clear case I ordered. First of all it's not really clear. It's got that cloudy kind of glow in the dark silicone look to it. It also lacked protection on the front, from either moisture or impact. The actual clip is made of hard plastic, which I suspected would be the first thing to break. I was wrong. On the second day of using it I accidentally brushed up against a piece of equipment at work. The clip held up to my surprise, but the silicone case tore all the way around the clip. Four dollars a day! The killer is if it wasn't for the free shipping on this item I would have never bought it. Urghhh!"
1,Not worth it,This case broke the second week of use. The back attachment broke off. Very disappointed.
5,Very good value without download fees,My wife and I both have one of these. We use LimeWire to download our favorites without any cost. I enjoy the simplicity and user replaceable AAA battery with long play times. We use the headphones or attach to our vehicle or portable radios to hear through the speakers.
2,"Great price, except for the shipping!","Being one who really doesn't like the arm strap MP3 player holders, This holder for the m series is a great device. But, it's fragile and becoming hard to find. The price for this belt clip holder was great, until the rubber part the plastic clip stays in failed. This took all of two weeks.Figure this is a fluke because, on the last two, it was the plastic clip itself that broke.The shipping price, however, is another matter. It doubled the price for this holder. Ouch!"
4,Good protection for the little Sansa,This is a good protective case to have for the Sansa mp3 player. It fits snug and is very easy to place on the unit. The belt clip is good and it makes the player very portable. I would purchase this item again.
4,Great Value,"Small but with many great features. Addition of level volume playback would be a plus, but still a great value."
1,Poorly designed,I was disapointed with this product as the design and materials aren't up to standard. The case that comes with the player while made of cheap looking materials is a better design and allows you to use the arm band that comes with it. The plastic clip on this slicone one is just that a clip and is not designed for use with an arm band. I had a simular clip on a Bell rear flashing red led light which broke off and fell to the road while I was Bicycling. I would not trust this product to hold the player securly and will not use it...What a waste of money especially the rediculous shipping cost for such a small lightweight item. The from of this silicon case is open to the weather unlike the one that comes with the unit. I am sticking with the original case as it is a far better design for sports.. especially Bicycling. I don't know how this product got such a high average rating as it is garbage!
1,Disappointment,"I was very excited to receive this player as I wanted to create a playlist of all of the music for my mother's 80th birthday party. I spent a lot of time in music selections and creating this playlist but unfortunately it never would play all the way through. It kept freezing in the middle of a song, and not the same song every time. I tried to delete the files where it would freeze, but that didn't help. I read the message boards about this particular player and found that freezing is a common problem. It has been returned and I will be shopping for an ipod this time."
2,Review of TheraSpa 10 Motor Massaging Seat Topper,"I bought the product for my boyfriend. I was interested in a different brand of massager however, it was not available with the car adaptor. I bought the TheraSpa because it came with the car and home adaptor. However, when the product arrived, there was only a car adaptor and NO home adaptor. In addition, the massage seat is basically just a vibrating seat that makes much to much noise. Overall disappointed with the product and service from Amazon.com"
5,Found hard to find item,These cushioned toilet seat are much better than the plain and if you don't cover it up with those carpet lid covers these have embroidery for the nice appearance.
4,price difference,"Dear Amazon,I noticed DVD PLANET has ""Trouble in Mind"" available forpre-order at $ 14.16. Much higher than your price.As always-hope to be ordering from you at a cheaperprice.Thanks,SM"
5,Very Cute,this costume was very cute and warm for my daughter she fell in love with as well as othersThis is a very good product
4,An Effective Pet Care Product,It is a good product. We use it to confine our dog to our study while we are out or on our front porch while we are hanging out. It has a good blend of stability and portability.The lock on the handle is a bit tricky to snap into place.
3,Great dog gate,"I have extra wide doors and it is hard to find a gate to fit them that doess not require screwing into the wood. This works great, just not as attractive as I would like."
5,Excellent Gate For The Price,"This mesh gate was purchased to keep a Yorkie puppy within a specific area in the apartment. All of the gates I found in local area stores would not extend wide enough to cover the doorway and the few that did were quite expensive. However, this gate met the measurement requirements and despite the Yorkie continuously jumping against it in an attempt to get out, it has stood firm and has met all of my expectations."
2,I hope it was just a lemon,"This gate is exactly what we were looking for to place on our deck while the kids are outside playing. I wanted something taller than the standard gates you find in stores. However, we used it one time and the metal piece on the bottom of it snapped off, the wood actually split off to be more specific. I am returning it and have already ordered a replacement in hopes that it was just a defectives one we received. However, after reading some of the other 1 star reviews, it may just be a poorly constructed gate. I've had ones that cost half as much that have lasted me for years. So we shall see I guess. I recommend you save the box just in case."
4,"Good Gate, but some minor faults","This gate is exactly what it says, a wider than average gate. Works as expected. I only with the retaining clips on the top and bottom are very weak. But, for the price it is exactly what you expect."
1,silversky,"Gate came apart the second day of use. Poorly constructed, non durable. I would return this but I threw out the carton it came in and the size is so unusual that I haven't found a way to send it back to the manufacturer. My advice, buy another product."
5,Great gate for my small dog,"I bought this gate for a 50"" wide opening in my kitchen. I wanted to keep my dog behind it and after reading some of the reviews, I was skeptical. This fits nice and tightly in the space. It's certainly not the most heavy duty wide gate I've seen but for the price, it absolutely cannot be beat."
4,Does the job,I use this gate to block a large hallway and keep my dogs in a structured area. It's wide and tall - just the right dimensions for a Golden Retriever. The dogs don't challenge the gate. If they did it probably wouldn't hold up that well. Price and shipping were typical Amazon - great!
1,This gate gouged my walls!!,"I bought three of these gates for a weekend visit from friends with a 2-year old. When I put them in place, for them to be tight enough to stay, the end of the lever arm digs into and ruins the wall. Now, this may be in part because we live in an older house, and the walls may not be completely straight, but truly it feels like a design flaw. The side bends from the pressure of mounting the gate and brings that arm right into the wall as you bring it down. I bought pressure gates to AVOID ruining the walls. These were such a disappointment, I returned them and scrambled to get something else."
5,Great Pet Gate at a really great price!,"This pet gate is the best gate for both height and width I found anywhere, either online searching, Walmart or in other local stores that offer types of pet gates! I recommend it to anyone in need of a good sturdy pet gate!"
2,With a little help...,"The fair price attracted me to this item. This gate was broken upon receipt. Poor packaging caused brackets to come apart and wood to split in two different places. No Styrofoam or internal padding whatsoever. The shipping label had a rather large imprint of a boot on it. Brackets could not be reattached to their intended location. I had to relocate these brackets in order to make this item useable. Item is poorly constructed out of cheap materials, the fair price reflects this. Once repaired, item is useable."
5,baby gate for new puppy,this gate is great for keeping our airedale puppy confined ot the kitchen - even full grown we don't think he'll be able to jump it
3,Ok--just depends on what u are using it for,"We bought this gate to keep our new cat separate from the old. We actually ended up extending if to the widest with and flipping it up like a screen door. The older cat did not jump it, but did manage to climb up it. Boy were we and the new cat both surprised! It's a standard issue type of gate and did serve the purpose. It did arrive quickly and without any shopping issues. As long as u don't have cats with super power like ours, it's a good deal!"
1,DO NOT BUY!,"This gate can expand to 50"", but when expanded that far it will not stay in place.So you have to use wood shims on both edges to keep it in place or the unit will easily push over.AND...talk about hard to use..you have to have 8 arms to get it in place and then clamp it down.So I am considering hiring an octopus to help!This is really poorly constructed,I already snapped my fingers twice when closing it (!%#!&%@$),As for the clamp that tightens the gate, it is so cheap,I expect it to break off at any moment."
2,"Good product, but didn't work for me.","The gate actually works fine, it is tall and wide enough. It's just as described. However, my dog just climbs over it. The wire mesh is far enough apart that he just climbed right over it. Unfortunately, he also chewed up the top of the gate so I can't even return it because it's damaged.This might work well to stop the dog from jumping over, but if you have a determined dog then they'll climb over it."
1,Piece of Junk,"This gate is the right width and the right height for the space, but now matter how we tried, we were never able to get the tension right and it kept falling over. We gave up after less than a day and moved on."
1,Exactly what I needed!!,Was bought to keep 3 large and 1 small dog in a room and it works great. Pretty sturdy and easy to operate! The price was much lower than the other gates I found which is a plus!
1,I would avoid this product if you want to use it for dogs,"I bought 3 of these (recommendation off the internet and a lot cheaper then standard pet gates) to keep my dog inside the kitchen while I was away. He is a miniature Daschund and I hate leaving him in a cage for a long periods of time. I bought this model because it is tall enough for him not to be able to jump over it. However, the wire mesh on it is easily bendable. After the first day of using it, I came home and found him sitting on the couch waiting for me. He was able to grab a hold of the mesh by biting and pulling it and completely pulled the mesh from the frame, gaining access to the living room. In the process of returning the other 2 undamaged ones back to Amazon."
1,Lasted about 1 week.... See photos,"I buy a ton of products off of Amazon and rarely rate them... This time, I had to.My wife and I bought this gate to restrict our beagle to the kitchen/dining area while away. We have another gate of similar size (from another maker) and bought this to replace a smaller version that the beagle had managed to knock down several times. Our beagle is not a large dog... Very mid-sized and though we love him... Not overly smart.We came home today and he was free! He had managed to pull the mesh from the wooden corner and escape. The mesh was mangled. Upon closer look, the mesh wasn't attached into the wooden frame very well.I wouldn't recommend this fence due to the poor attachment of the mesh. The wood was firm and it feels structurally sound, but if the mesh doesn't stay in the frame, what good is it??"
3,Basic and functional,"We purchased this product to use for our Bernese mountain dog. It took a while for us to get used to setting up. It doesn't always fit tightly, but our dog doesn't push against it. We had hoped to use it in other hallways, but it wasn't large enough. We currently use it in the doorway or propped on the stairs. We have a spindle railing on the stairs, so it doesn't work as a pressure gate, but we just prop it on the bottom stair to block her path. She doesn't mess with it, but it has fallen a few times whenever it slides down or is tipped or knocked. Obviously that's not how it's intended to be used, so I'm not complaining. And when it falls, it hasn't hurt her or damaged anything because it's pretty light. In general, this product has served our needs, but it's not always easy to position or particularly attractive. I would not recommend it for use around children, as they could likely get their fingers pinched or move it out of position."
3,Difficult,well I bought these for a polmerain and a chichuahua mix. They are very strong. Good colors and the widths are perfect. It is somewhat difficult to set up. It is a notch lock and unless you and hold it tight and sercurely by yourself and lock it with the other hand(can be done...takes time)do not buy it. Perfect if you have another person to hold it while you lock it.
5,Great Gate for the Money,"We bought this gate to keep the dogs out of the grand room when we leave the house (they have a tendency to have a party and jump all over our furniture when we are gone) It is very easy to use and a great height. We have a large Akita who has been know to jump fences, but he seems to know the boundaries of this here gate. Researched a lot of products to get the best bang for our buck; Nailed it :) Would recommend this product."
4,Large Gate,This gate worked great. Its nice & Tall so my 2 year old cant try to climb over it and it goes wide enough to fit securely in my really wide hallway. Seems much sturdier then the smaller ones i bought too.
1,Broke the first day!,Unfortunately this item is very cheaply made and broke the first day we used it. It's very inexpensive so maybe that's the problem.
4,Easy to use but scratches the wall,"This thing is super easy to use and slides very smoothly. It's probably overkill to keep a 7"" dog in a room but it works and doesn't look horrible. However, the ends of the middle bar do scratch the wall as you are pushing it into place. We don't care that much right now because we're in a rental property but this guy could really do some noticeable damage if you had plaster or dark paint."
5,Wide And Tall!,"Exactally what i needed, my shorter wooden one broke. This one is more heavy duty and wide enuff for any hallway and small enuff for any door and tall enuff for my tall 2 year old."
1,This book needed a good editor,"I could hardly wait to read this book! It seemed to have everything! Henry V111, Anne Boleyn! Celtic Heritage! Just my kind of book! The inside cover notes that it is an unpublished manuscript, and apparently, an unedited one! The author must not know that sentences end with a PERIOD! Almost all her sentences end with an exclamation mark! By page 70, I gave up the ghost and decided to wait till the edited version comes out!If reading my review with all the exclamation points doesn't bother you, then the book is for you. But it bothered me to the point it ruined the book and I didn't finish it. It seemed so amateurishly written it was a waste of my time to read it."
1,Terrible book. One star is too much.,"If you are looking for a book on past lives, keep looking. Ditto if you are interested in English history or want a good paranormal novel. This is one of the worst books I have ever tried to read.Poorly written, not edited at all, nor even proofed.Nuff said."
2,Jungle Book Poster,"I ordered this item because I really needed it for a particular project. The seller mailed it out a week AFTER my order (and I used paypal so they were payed instantly). Then I get the item, and its a photo copy of the poster! Wish I would have known I was getting a photo copy of the poster instead of an actual poster!"
5,Was delighted with its condition and speed of delivery,this was intended as a Christmas present for my brother as our father flew mosquitos in WW2. He has rung my twice to say thank you!
1,awful awful awful,I've actually never reviewed a product but these were so frustratingly crappy that I though saving someone else the dissappointment might be therapeutic. My Sony's wore out after like 4 or 5 years so my husband got me this 3 pack for listening at work. The sound quality leaves more to be desired (& I'm nowhere close to a tech/audio snob).Every pair was crap within 2 weeks of use-- the sound would cut in & out. I would be at work jiggling the cord and tilting my head inadvertently trying to get sound to both headphones. How ridiculous is that... I've never paid for something & had it fall so short of the basic functionality it should be delivering.Don't waste your money.
3,Good Enough,"The neckband in-ear phones are the best of this bunch so you might want to consider buying the stand alone set (CVE207). I actually think the sound is pretty good on both the neckband and earbud models - comparable to Sony's MDR-W08L. Unfortunately, the sound quality on the clip-on headphones is very disappointing - they might be okay for audiobook but are just not good enough for music use."
1,poor quality,"These were very uncomfortable, they are hard plastic and have no covering to cushion them against your ears. Also they are very cheaply made. Also not very good sound"
2,Don't waste your money!,I only bought these because they were the only ones I could find that were both behind-the-head and bud style. The sound quality is horrible. Don't bother.
4,Works with my cable DVR,I bought this as an extra because they are always disappearing in my house. Very easy to program and use.
5,Unbelievable functionality at low price,"I found this remote in a Walgreens store. It has unbelievable functionality for a cheap remote. I was able to program my TV, VCR, DVD, Hughes TiVo/DirecTV receiver, and audio receiver and customize the functionality of each unit on this remote.The only con I've found is that the response time is a bit slow. This is only noticable for things like TiVo menus when one must scroll through lists, for example.I'm going to buy a second remote for my upstairs TV & VCR!"
2,Yuck,Didn't work worth a D..... We tried everything. Even called the company for advice. Our TV is only a couple years old and we coouldn't find the right code so we tried to manually go through them all. Got it working but the up button was the volume button and so on.
1,Horrrrribbbblleee,This camera was just horrible..at first it was awesome then it just headed down hill.. The cover scrached my film. horrible.
1,in just one week it smoked itself!,"Well I'm with the others on here that had this drive commit suicide. And like them, memorex is not willing to 100% stand by thier warranty. I'm furious. I'll be staying far away from memorex."
4,A classic show that's great to have back,"Wow, my boyfriend has always talked about ""Steve Canyon"". If you're a fan of old TV shows or an airplane freak, this is great. The plots and storylines are not exceptional except that some are unique to the time period, but the best aspect to me is to the old aircraft (they used actual military clips for many takeoff and flight scenes) and to see the changes we've made in history in the last 50 or so years. No more cold war!! Women's rights? ERA may not have passed but we've come a long way, baby. I'm happy to sit back and watch these shows and enjoy the old planes, while I laugh at the old lifestyles.This DVD set is specifically to raise money to have the whole Steve Canyon series remastered and released. I can't wait and I'm glad to have contributed to the effort. I might need to by more copies for my uncles and brothers!!"
3,imaginex pirate ship,"My boys, age three & one-half, and six & one-half, enjoy playing with it, although we wish it included more figures. And the cannons are a little finicky for young hands to set in place and deploy the cannon ""missiles""."
3,Fisher-Price imaginex Adventures Pirate Ship,"My grand children are 4 and were thrilled when they opened the Imaginex Adventure Pirate Ship. I do not have any further feedback yet as to how they like playing with it. What I do know is this; when I ordered from Amazon.com, I thought this was the latest model. Then I saw it advertised elsewhere and noticed addional accesory parts were included with the set that did not come with the one from Amazon. I tried to get the addional parts seperately but have not been successful in doing so. Although my grandsons and possibly there parents are not aware of the omission I was dissapointed."
3,Probably best for a four year old,"I got this toy for my son who is about to turn three. I was excited to get it for him since he has started to play and pretend with his cars and spaceships that he has. But sadly he hasn't really got into it. I see it as being really cool and fun to play with but I think he's just not there yet for play and pretend. But all he's been interested in are the three molded together canons that shoot out little canonballs. Although he's lost all but one now.It's a big toy. About the size of a large breadbox. But it has lots of cool things with it. The sails go up and down, the anchor can be dropped and it comes with plastic gold coins and a treasure map. I'm hoping he'll grow into having fun with the toy but for a three year old and where he is with his development, he's just not quite there. But a four year old may love it. Especially if they love pirates."
4,Lots of Fun,Bought this toy for my 5 1/2 year old grandson. He loves pirates and his eyes just lit up when the ship arrived. I think it will be one of those toys that if taken care of will be passed on to the next generation.
4,gmitchp,"My 5 yr. old son saw this toy while we were in K mart. He was crushed when I told him that Santa told me he was making him one. Of all the gifts he received on Christmas, this one was ""THE"" gift. Weeks later, and he still plays with it frequently. We are very pleased with this toy."
4,so...so,"When I saw this toy in holiday circulars, I wanted my son to have it because I thought it looked way cool. (You know...one of those toys you wouldn't mind playing with on Christmas morning.) It was well received and extracted out of the box immediately. Currently, it lies on the floor largely unnoticed. To be fair, I have yet to set up the cannons and all the other accesories that compliment the pirate ship and I am confident that once we have ""souped"" it up, interest will increase. I am a huge fan of Imaginext toys because they are durable and have kept my boys occupied for years. The other Imaginext toys in our house owe me NOTHING and I am sure once the commotion of the holidays dies down, this toy will not dissapoint!"
3,2007 Is new version,"My son got this last Christmas(2006), and we were all excited. But within days we found the ship kept coming apart even with very little force applied while he was playing. It soon docked to the side of the room and made a voyage every once-in-a-while when my son saw something pirate like, but then was left for us to clean up and repair.I don't know if the 2007 version is better, but it certainly looks better with a lot more features. If the ship's hull comes apart in various pieces, I would hesitate to buy it. Try it out in the store first if you can or don't be afraid to return it if your child gets frustrated after a week(keep in mind your store's return policy)If it was fixed for 2007, it seems like it would be worth buying. It only gets 3 stars for fun because of the frustration the 2006 version causes"
4,Great Pirate Ship,Our 6 year old grandson was hoping to get this ship from Santa. When he did get it his eyes got big and he let out the sound of joy. He and his brothers are playing with it constantly. Lots of fun for all.
4,Great value,"This has been THE toy since my son's 3rd birthday. He's entranced by different aspects of it. From using the cannons to fire to hiding the treasure to using all the ""action points"" on the boat itself.If I have any quibbles, they are minor. I wish there were more pirate action figures (three's two), though with a three-year old's imagination, dinosaurs have become part of the crew. I was also thrown at first as to what the red balloon looking items were before noticing on the box that they were for the cannons.I'm a bit surprised that some of the reviews have mentioned the lack of sturdiness of the product. It seems put together fine to me."
4,enhances the imagination,Fisher-Price Imaginext Adventures Pirate ShipA high priority on grandson's wish list. He became a pirate and really loved the treasure chest!
5,Nephew LOVED it!!,I gave this ship to my 4 year old nephew for Christmas and he loved it! The frustration free packaging is the way to go. It was so easy to get right out of the box and play with it. :)
5,Pirate Ship,"I bought this for my 3 year old grandson who loves all things pirate, this is the only thing he played with on Christmas and for 3 days he stayed with us. It sparks imagination, has enough ""kid powered"" movement to keep them interested. This is the best toy I have ever got for him and highly recommend it for all aspiring pirates"
1,Why the high price...,The suggested retail price on the Fisher-Price website is $36...it is listed on Amazon for $179.99 (why I rated 1 star overall)! My son has one that we bought for around $30 at Target over the summer and he loves it.
5,Nephew Loved It,"I got this item for my 3-year old nephew two years ago at Christmas when the toy first hit the shelves at the toy store. A year later, my sister told me he loved it and still plays with it a whole year later. I also saw reviews listing it as one of the best toys for toddlers in the last 5 years. I want to buy it for my little boy now."
5,A Pirates dream,"My 4 year old got this for his birthday. He has not stopped playing with it. It has so many little extras. The sails go up and down, there are lots of little buttons and switches that can make the ship do different things. So far this toy seems to be durable. It is a great toy."
3,pirate ship,"There are pictures on the box that are separate purchases, my three year old grandson can't read and couldn't understand why these things were not in the box. He seemed to enjoy the toy although I felt it wasn't sturdy enough for his rough play."
5,Fisher-Price Imaginext Adventures Pirate Ship,"I bought this toy on the recommendations of a co-worker, who purchased it for her grandsons. I gave it to my grandson for his 4th birthday. It is the first thing he plays with in the morning and the first toy he goes to when he comes home from daycare. It is always in motion and in everyone's walkways. There was virtually no assembly required, so he did not have to sit patiently while it was put together before he could play with it. It is durable and has seen many rough seas since arriving at his house. The imagination and role playing that this toy has fostered is amazing. It's a win, win toy for any little boy."
5,One toy that might last to see grandchildren,"Very few of my 3 1/2 year old sons toys do I envision worthy and durable enough to get passed down to his children.....but this one has a lot of neat functions as the other reviewers noted, and in my opinion is very solid and durable.....and requires NO BATTERIES!!! The only complaint is that the box did not highlight all the cool things it does, nor did it come with directions, so I am just finding out bit by bit all the little things it can do (i.e. the pirates armor is removable, the cannon balls can launch one at a time or all three together out either side of the ship doors). I wish I had a 3, 4, or 5 year old boy to buy for this holiday....this is the toy I would buy....quality toy, great price, and a lot of fun."
4,Great toy,Good toy to develop kid imaginationNot too much small pieceseasy to understandthe canons fire real bullet - it`s great.
4,"Lots of little parts, but still a good toy all in all...","My son is 3 so I definitely see most of the parts and people getting lost, but the main ship is very fun to play with regardless! I do wish that some of the parts were permanent because they really make the ship look gorgeous, but are very easy to remove and so they don't stay on even through the normal play process. Nonetheless, every button, lever, etc leads to another fun discovery... sails move up and down... the cannons engage for battle...all in all i am satisfied with the toy and my son loves playing with it. Just be prepared to lost most of the accessories."
4,very impressive,"I was used to the usual Chinese junk. I bought several toys on amazon.com and thought that I will decide upon opening which toy goes to which child.We were so impressed with quality of this ship that we ended up keeping this gift for our 4 1/2-old boy.There are a number of little parts, so I would not recommend it to a 3 year-old or younger. There are lots of ways your child can play with the ship.Our son loved it."
4,Nice Toy,My 5 year old son received this toy from Santa and really likes it. He especially likes shooting the cannons and lowering the anchor. He has been playing with this toy more than the other toys he received for Christmas.
2,Not worth your time...,This book was on my reading list for my MA. I kept thinking it was going to provide some revelations but it never did! On top of that the writing was a mess and most stories/examples seemed irrelevant to his overall purpose for this book (although beyond the prologue it wasnt clear what that was exactly). It was a waste of my time.
3,Pages missing,"The content of the book is fine. The production of the book is poor. My first copy came with 15 pages missing. The second copy came with 15 different pages missing. The publisher cannot promise a complete book for some time, so I would not suggest that anyone order it any time soon."
5,Another Kantra Hit!,"Rachel's packed up her two kids and everything she owns, and is heading home to her mother's house where she finds a man sleeping in her bed -- a very naked, sexy man. He's Sean MacNeill, her mother's tenant. He's definitely a piece of eye-candy, and as she grows to know him, Rachel discovers he's even more attractive inside than out. And he makes it clear he's interested in her. But interest or not, Rachel doesn't have time for Sean, not when the mobs on her heels. She has her family to worry about.Sean knows Rachel's in trouble, but she's keeping him at arm's length. How can he help her if she won't let him come any closer? And Sean wants to be closer . . . much closer. Can he save her from her demons, and better yet, can he save himself from falling head-over heels for her?Virginia Kantra delivers another powerful story of love and intrigue, of honor and trust. A great read that will tempt you to read it all in one sitting!"
5,KANTRA DELIVERS ANOTHER WINNER!,"Like many others, I waited with eager anticipation for the latest MacNeill brother book - and was pleased beyond even my already high expectations. Kantra delivers another winner with Sean's story. Be prepared to stay up late! Virginia Kantra's books are real keeper-shelf material."
4,Great hook!,"A tightly-written novel that starts with a strange, naked man in the heroine's bed and proceeds at a fair pace. I liked the preceding novel in the trilogy well enough, but this is better. The characters are fleshed out quite well, and though I wanted to strangle the heroine at times, she had extremely good reasons for being such a wimp -- which made her seem so much more courageous when she decided finally to DO something about her situation.That situation is a tense one, very well constructed and scary, and the addition of some realistic-sounding kids complicates matters even further. Hero and heroine showed a very warm chemistry. Sean is definitely someone I wouldn't mind having live in my garage... or finding naked in my bed. The sex scenes arose organically from the plot, unlike the slightly uncomfortable ones in the previous novel. Well done and enjoyed!Cover: quite eyecatching!"
2,I did not like the main character Rachel's actions.,"She was being threatened by small time loan sharks, but she would not seek help or advice in dealing with them. The reason she gave was that she didn't want anyone to help her because they might end up getting hurt. Sean helped her in many ways and loved her but she refused to be with him saying ""I can't let you in and live with the fear of losing you."" She was not following her true feelings and did stupid things. I couldn't enjoy a book with a main character like this.Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: three. Setting: current day U.S. Copyright: 2000. Genre: contemporary romance."
3,Needed Front Mud Guards,I had searched for front mud guards and these came up and did not specify in the description whether front or rear. Guess I should have assumed rear. They seemed durable just not suitable for my purposes.
1,Not what I wanted,These were a gift for my husband and didn't realize it said ram when I ordered it. I had to return them.
5,Great deal on good shoes,"Like all Stride Rite products, these shoes are great! They have held up to a lot of wear and even cleaned up well when I needed to throw them in the washer after my son had an accident."
5,This is the only authorized version of this CD,"This is the only authorized version of Surfin' by the Marketts with the actual photo of the real Marketts on the cover. Release by KRB Music, this is a great CD!"
5,"good product, nice mgmt software, worked as expected.","Installed into an HP proliant server for cheap disk expansion. Made a 2 TB raid 5 array with three SATA disks. Product software installed well on win2k3; and alerts on drive failure. Can enable or disable array card caching/acceleration. Battery comes with product. All in all, nice product!"
4,"MISS DORTHY, DR. B, AND TONI FISHER'S BIG HURT","Toni Fisher's very memorable recording of ""The Big Hurt"" played a big role in the daily life of a small, dark Galveston, Texas nightclub, The Metropole.Here's a true story I posted at Texas Escapes Magazine. [...]Miss Fisher's ""The Big Hurt"" will remain a classic from the '60s."
4,Fast & Easy,This was an upgrade for my G4 iMac. The HD was full and I still had a lot of life left in my trusty iMac. This was a good value for the price and installed very easily. I Partitioned it for the Mac and the rest was seemless.
3,WARNING - not what the description says!,"The description for this product says ""Full kit includes drive cables, installation and management software, and illustrated instructions"". All I got was an OEM drive... just the drive with no cable, rails, software, instructions or anything else. I don't know if an underpaid stockboy just screwed up or what, but everyone should be aware.I'm keeping it because I just wanted the bare drive anyway, but I wanted to warn others who might be counting on the additional items."
4,No complaints with this drive,"I bought this drive to replace a smaller drive that was starting to make scary noises. The formatting, partitioning, and disk copy software worked as advertised, but the system didn't initially recognize it when I configured it as the master drive. I had to fiddle with the jumpers, but once I got that figured out it was fine."
5,W D harddrive,"Worked right out of the box. Just like it supposed to.I wasnt sure at first with the EIDE title, until I did some research on Google. Thanks Google and Thanks Amazon.Always satisfide with your help,"
4,helpful,"Biographers do not CHOOSE to skip over Lewis' war years. They cannot help it: Lewis hardly liked to talk about it. But this paints a pretty picture - a truthful picture. People often forget that Jack was only nineteen, fighting in the first World War. A young scholar in the trenches. It is a good knock upon the head."
5,A Perfect Full Circle,"Jorma-you've done it again! although many bands rest on thier laurels and cash in on playing ONLY thier most well known stuff (e.g. rolling stones,et.,al.), you play from where your heart is at the moment and that is as honest as it gets. this cd is beautiful, inspirational, and timeless, just as your earliest releases! The only thing left to hope for is a new Tuna album. i ask only because you've spoiled us for 40 years so why not 40 more!!People-buy this cd and catch this man live.he's a true national treasure!"
3,Nice mix of original/comtemporary stuff and traditional music. Good musicianship.,"Jorma brings some contemporary music (Fur Peace Rag, Living in the Moment, Heart Contemporary), some tributes to the Rev. Gary Davis (There's A Table Sitting In Heaven, Roy Bookbinder's The Preacher Picked the Guitar), few spirituals, and other material to make a diverse-sounding, well-crafted CD.The guitar work is understated and the vocals are unique to Jorma' style (whuch might turn a person if you haven't heard him before.To the folks who object to the Christian music---get over yourselves. It's an important part of the tradition that shaped Jorma's style. A lot of the old music was 'secular' music with 'sacred' words.Probably not a good CD for first timers, but consistent in quality with most of his work.Three stars because it's doesn't break any new ground (5 star) or rates as a 'best-of-its-kind (4 star)."
5,Feel good music,I really enjoyed this one. You can sing along and dance to it. It leaves you feeling good with some upbeat music.
2,if you're not a Christian it won't be for you,it was disheartening to hear messages of exclusion and righteousness--great gospel music brings all people in as it embraces the human condition and our yearning to become better people. In this CD unfortunately one must believe that Jesus is the only way to have a spiritual life.
3,Stokke parasol,"A good-looking parasol, matches the beige stroller X-plory, but not the most practical. It can be put only on the left side of the stroller"
4,The Best Collection!!!!!,I was very pleased with this album.It has all the best songs and for the price it is well worth it!!All the songs Sound as good as they did when they were released!!I would recommend this album to everyone.
3,A trip down memory lane,I do not understand why cds by Andy Gibb are so rare. I enjoyed listening to a good collection of his music.
5,"Phenomenal talent he was, very gifted artist!","Andy Gibb had to have been one of the best singers of the '70s. He sang the songs so very good and this collection really covers his best material. The hits like Shadow Dancing I love and Everlasting Love, Desire, and Our Love are still superb, but the other songs are nice, some I got to hear for the first time last year. After Dark is smooth and Time Is Time has that Def Leppard-meets-AC/DC heavy metal element to it. Those two duets he did with Olivia Newton-John and another female singer are fabulous. It was sad that he passed away in 1988, for he could have given us so much more. For his brothers the Bee Gees to guide his career and produce his songs and albums is an true showing of support for their flesh and blood. A well assembled and dynamic album and tribute to him!"
3,To Answer Your Question ...,"Yes, this CD has the original, full-length version of ""Time Is Time,"" which I agree is one of Gibb's better songs. Despite the change in title, this is actually the CD version of ""Andy Gibb's Greatest Hits,"" an LP that was released in 1981 or thereabouts. It also includes the non-hits ""Me (Without You)"" and ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow,"" the latter cut probably the best duet Gibb ever performed. (I found his songs with Olivia Newton-John to be among his worst vocal performances; his voice was embarrassingly softer than hers -- no mean feat, that.)Unfortunately, this CD does not include ""All I Have to Do Is Dream,"" Gibb's duet with Victoria Principal, or ""Man on Fire,"" which appeared on Gibb's previous greatest-hits package, so it's hardly inclusive. I guess those songs, and others no doubt hidden in a vault somewhere, will turn up in time for the inevitable boxed set."
3,Solid yet frustrating collection,"As the other reviewers have pointed out, this collection is very similar to the 1991 Andy Gibb anthology. However, there are a few key differences. All of the songs on the Millenium Collection have been newly remastered and sound slightly better than those on the earlier collection, so audiophiles should go with the new compilation. Completists will also need to purchase the Millenium Collection just to have ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow"" on CD.Unfortunately, I can only give a qualified recommendation to the Millenium Collection due to Polydor/Universal's boneheaded decision to leave the classic ""Flowing Rivers"" off of the album. ""Flowing Rivers"" is one of Andy's best songs and is conspicuous in it's absence from the new anthology. Thus, the casual would be best served by opting for the 1991 compilation for the best selection of songs, all in perfectly acceptable sound quality."
4,Moving,"""Firefly Cloak"" is an interesting, often moving account of a teenager, the mother who abandoned her, and the grandmother who raised her. The characters are well drawn, but the prose is uneven. Some of the images are great, such as the complex patterns traced out by the rickshaw taxi. Some miss the mark, such as the image of the worm with which the book concludes. More of a problem is that Reynold's prose, while getting the job down, can be heavy handed."
1,Depressing,"Depressing, strange and I forced myself to finish it. Why do I do this to myself? If you're just too happy in life and need some negativity, then this is the one for you."
4,4 star,Good book. Keeps you interested and wanting to read more. One of those books that once you start it is hard to stop.
4,The Intersecting Lives of 3 Women,"I really liked this story. The character development was really strong and I found my self engaged and drawn to each woman's story for different and similar reasons. I especially appreciated the adolescent perspective and how the author managed to allow her to retain a sense of innocence, even while she discovered that the world wasn't an innocent (or good) place.My only hesitation in giving this book a full 5 stars was the ending. Without giving too much away, I was disappointed how everything seemed to wrap up in a few simple lines, while it took pages and pages to create the culmination of each woman; it felt like a bit of a let down."
5,One of My Favorite Buys This Year!,"This is a super CD. Matt Cheplic provides a engaging, easy to listen collection of tunes. Hard to compare him to anyone. Sort of Buddy Holly meets Frank Sinatra meets Elvis Costello. Catchy lyrics, catchy music, catchy talent - catch it! This is a great first offering and a recommended buy."
2,ok if you dont use it much,"loved the look and protection, hate the lack of sturdiness and durability. If you don't use your belt clip a lot, you will probably be fine with this product...if you do, look out, It just is not very strong and the little plastic rivets break off and then the case releases when you do not want it to. Its not the clip's problems, the rivets on the neoprene fabric are weak and cannot stand repeated stress. Wanna lose your phone off your belt clip? This product can make it happen."
3,A reasonable antenna rotator,This is an reasonable antenna rotator. One minor problem is that it doesn't always return to the original positions when you rotator back and forth. I have to use the signal meter to determine the best position of a station.
3,"Good, even great insight but..","William Ball gives some pretty strong and important insight in A Sense of Direction. I would recommend all directors read this book whether they work with high school or professional actors. This book also contains important insight for actors who are serious about improving their craft.The only real issue I have with this book is Ball's writing style. The first few chapters of the book are dense and can be tough to get through. Even in latter chapters, Ball uses many more words than necessary to make his point. This significantly detracts from the reading experience.That aside, this is still a good book with a lot of valuable insight that can be a great read for all directors and actors."
5,Great for new Directors,This product I got for my daughter who is in a Directing class in college. This book explains many features of directing especially if you're new which she is. This book is helping her out a lot!
4,Required reading for a class,Good book! Highly recommended by the instructor of our director's class for community theatre.
3,Some great stuff,"William Ball's ""Sense of Direction"" has some excellent information for those involed in, or thinking about becoming involved in, directing. However, Mr. Ball is coming from the world of professional actors and sometimes his advise is not applicable for directors involved in educational theatre."
1,Yawn!,I could not even finish watching this movie! With Gary Cooper how could it go wrong? Trust me. It did. Not worth the viewing or the purchasing.
4,What a gift,I got this for my niece for her wedding shower. She loves old movies and I thought what a perfect gift for her for her wedding shower gift. She really got a kick out of my sense of humor it being so creative in part of my gift to her and her new husband.
1,Apply with caution!,"Be careful when applying this to your face. I suggest spraying on your hands in small amounts and applying to your face as evenly as possible. if you don't get it even, you can end up with large dark spots on your face and they don't wash off for days. Unfortunately I have some light colored freckles. This product will tan your freckles and make them darker too. Has a coconut scent or a scent that reminds you of suntan lotion....more like a cocoa butter scent."
1,Didn't work,after seeing all of the 5 star ratings i had really high hopes for this product. it just didn't work for me. there was no color change in my skin at all.
4,Pretty decent,This is a pretty decent tanner but startes to look a little splochey after 3 or 4 days so you will need to reapply.
4,It's uphill from here!,"While I think the follow-up, ""VooDoo Roux Deux"" is a superior compilation overall, the one's still a keeper. The three tracks that really stand out, for me, are Omnimotion's ""Underdub"", Trance Groove's ""Paris"" (both dreamy, sweet and erotic. ""Paris"" in particular) and MK-Ultra's pulsating, smokey ""111"".X.I.X's ""Sunwalker"" would fit perfectly as Clint Eastwood walks around in one of his old ""Spagehti Westerns"" from the sixties.Potlatch's ""Vacum Conversation"" is the weakest link here. Not bad, just nothing special. Journeyman's ""3001"", while intriqueing for the most part, is a bit weak to use as a conclusion. It kinda just left me hanging waiting for the climax that never really came.Reguardless, a fun saucy album. Worth owning."
5,Wonderful!,"I bought this CD for my mom because she loves Loretta Lynn. I am not too familiar with all her songs but I bought this CD because it had Coal Miners Daughter in it, which I do know. When we put it on and listened to the whole CD I thought it was great! I loved all the songs."
5,Five Stars Plus a Thank You,"This is the first practical book I have seen that tells you simply and easily which wines go best with which food. The nicest thing about the book is that it is not stuffy. It tells you which wines will go well with things like nachos, Kentucky Fried Chicken as well as elegant foods like Chateaubriand, coq du vin, etc.Tells you, too, how and where to buy wine....and all the wines are American !"
1,Leah Haley has recanted by saying alien abductions don't happen,I read this book a couple of years ago and I was dissapointed with it. I didn't feel there was anything in the book regarding alien abductions as a whole. Now she has publicly stated that alien abductions do not happen and that she can explain away every alien abduction with human technology and mind control. You can reference these articles at The Alien Jigsaw for her statements. Save your money and buy another book that has some real information on alien abductions. She should pull all her books about alien abduction off the market. She's making money on a topic that she now says doesn't exist.
2,Still Waiting for Results,"I began a ""lifestyle"" change that included a sensible breakfast, sensible lunch, whatever I want for dinner (please note; this does not mean being gluttonous), and 1EZ Diet as a supplement. I'd read enough about the product to know that results vary. However, I personally have not seen anything. I did not want to focus so much on actual lbs in terms of weightloss, my assessment is very much reliant on fitting comfortable into clothing that has grown tighter. After taking the supplement 3 weeks...those close are still just as tight."
3,works well,"this product works well, i did see some improvement in my weight loss not a lot but a realistic amount which is what i expected from it. i did like that it did not have any side affects such as bloating or gassiness from it. i liked this product fairly well and i believe that i will purchase this product again."
1,Poison!,"I'm a very healthy person that takes all kinds of vitamins and supplements, but after taking this product for a week (2 a day) I had major stomach problems and diarrhea.Be aware: This is poison for your body."
3,Ain't spandex great?,"This is an HBO remake of the original 50's 50 footer. Naturally there had to be some adjustments for the new era. However it still captures the thrills and chills. You may also marvel at the spandex clothing that stretches for ever (rats.)Nancy, the little woman, (Daryl Hannah) does not have quite the devoted husband (Daniel Baldwin.) Here life is not quite ideal. Soon a chance encounter with aliens (the space type) leaves her feeling bigger about the situation. 50 foot bigger. Now it is Nancy's turn for a little revenge. The ending is a little unnerving.Be sure to see Daryl in just as serious of a role in ""High spirits"" (1998)High Spirits"
2,Attack of the 50 Ft. PMS Woman,"Not as good as the original but at least it is in color! This was not one of Daryl Hannah's finest moment. Some of the special effects were laughable especially the miniaturization of the city. Over all, the cast wasn't that good. However, if remakes of old classics are your bag this might be for you. Now we wait for the Wasp Woman to be remade!"
3,Good special effects,The special effects are good.The film as a whole is average.If you are a Daryl Hannah fan I would recommend that you see this one.
1,When they invent minus 4 stars this film will earn it,"Action is always what moves a film forward. Over-dialogue will slow any film down. Our fifty foot woman just needs to expand on the plot from the last film giant. She needs a monument and a tour guide, an unsympathetic father, a female deputy and analyst, a swimming pool to take a spoiled soap suds bath in, persuing helicopters from a different era, and a spaceship to rescue her that will also torture her unfaithful hubby Harry (Daniel Baldwin) Now with all these wonderful extras you would wish she could spare the feminist terminology and just stomp on her jerk of a husband and the scheming floozy he's been fooling around with like she did in the first film! It was planned as a film but went to cable TV instead. Daryl Hannah might have helped write it, but would this material help her graduate from the seventh grade?"
3,Corny but funny,I haven't seen this movie in years but I have a massive dvd collection and purchased to add to it. This is actually a funny comedy film.
2,two,i loved this movie when i was a kid and i only remembered bits and pieces so i had to get it: it is cheesy as hell and the graphics sucked but it got two because it is original and i still like it in a corny way. If you watched this back in the day you may want it in your collection but don't end up dissapointed
3,Probably excellent thinking for it's era,I'm afraid I found this too out of date to be very useful to me.
2,dated depth psychology,"An exhaustive commentary on the archetype of the Great Mother as it relates to the birth of human awareness and the obstacles to obtaining it.I found the equation of consciousness and culture and spirituality with masculinity and nature/ unconsciousness/ instinctuality with femininity dated, unhelpful, and hopelessly biased. Apparently the author was immersed in the Great Mother himself as well as a product of his time. Check out Demaris Wehr's JUNG AND FEMINISM for a critique of the patriarchal elements of classical Jungian psychology."
1,This a DVD-RAM,"I thouht it was a single sided DVD-R and it turned out to be a DVD-RAM. There's a difference between the two, so be careful and always check the product photo before you add it to your cart.I don't know whose mistake this is."
4,Exfoliating crea.,"Very gentle, but works well for my flaky skin. I am diabetic and need the tender touch. Good job Clinique."
5,Such a family favorite we always purhase for gifts,"We love this book. My husband has owned a copy for over 20 years and he would lend it out. After awhile it did not get returned. I was so excited to find copies on Amazon. Everyone we have given this book to has loved it.These are short stories on a variety of topics (all true). My favorite is about the Shackelton expedition. I have not read every story, but have found this a great book to pick up when you don't have a lot of time. My husband likes the one about Meteors.This would be a good book to have kids read to learn new things on science, or history. The stories are well written and engaging as well as accurate.Great collection!!!"
5,Strange Stories,"I remember getting this book when I was in elementary school and I read it from cover to cover hundreds of times. The stories definitely got me interested in the world of the unexplained and fueled a passion for reading along the way. If you can get your hands on this book, even though it is dated information it is still really cool."
5,Excellent!,"It's one of those books where you can just grab it and open it to any random page and be interested in what you find. There are some portrayals of violence and nudity, but nothing truly offensive (i.e. Dante's Inferno, Day of Judgement, etc.). A really good easy reader."
4,Great Tunes,I heard one of her songs (the old Ray Charles tune You Don't Know Me) and liked it so decided to check out her work. Found this CD and liked the reviews so bought it. I like most all the tracks. Really enjoy her voice and style. Looking to maybe pick up another of her albums. Did not much care for the way she did the 'live' version of Insensitive but the rest is great.
5,love her twist on old classica,"I first heard Jann Arden on a movie track, maybe ""My Best Friend's Wedding""? I then bought this and LOVE< LOVE< LOVE IT! I love her voice and the twist she puts on the old familiar songs. Want to hear more!"
2,Disappointing,"I was actually disappointed when I bought this CD. I already own ""Living Under June"" and thought it was great, so how could a greatest hits compilation not be great, too? I figured it would include all of the best songs on ""Living Under June,"" plus all of her other great songs that I hadn't yet heard.Unfortunately, I was wrong. There are only one or two songs on the CD that are not on ""Living Under June"" that I thought were any good, and I have to like a song an awful lot to buy an entire CD for just one or two songs. My advice would be to stick with buying ""Living Under June,"" since that has some songs on it not included in this collection that are better than some that are included."
3,No Stone Unturned,"If you want to know about the Stone Age, this is your disc--right down to the stones themselves! Hugh Newman covers everything from how stones were moved to how they figure into the science of earth energy. There are also references for several books you can follow up with if you want to go even further."
4,I found myself in exotic places while reading this book,"Much of us in the United States have a hard time thinking ""outside of the box"". Jerome Schneider's book ""Complete guide to Offshore Money Havens"" allows us the opportunity to do that.He also helps you identify that it is very difficult to grow your financial tree if Uncle Sam in continually pruning your branches.Chris A. JacksonPresident / CEO , ConSource Corporatio"
2,"Selfserving , no real how to, no pit falls, just call him $+","The book tells lots of encouraging stories. Gives no real life advice either on ""How To"" or in reality ""Where To"" ultimately for anyone who ""Wants To"" So perhaps, ""Awareness"" he does provide along with a conceptuality to the those who are unaware that the concept exists and works. He does a Poor job of explaining especially to U. S. Citizens about the fact that this is in fact legal, albeit questionable to the IRS if improperly executed. Imagine for instance, when you finish the book sending off your hard earned after tax dollars to an address with the forms he provides. Try Las Vegas ! Also he basically suggests that you SHOULD really set up an Offshore Bank it is not easy"
1,I didn't like it much,"Ok, I read the book and it was ok. Some banks listed in the bank have gone into receivership (1st Cayman Bank, Eurobank). The book's advice is not for me. Too much was riding on the theory that legislation will not change. Recently (2/00) Clinton was talking about more reporting requirements for those who deal with offshore entities. Best advice is don't ask, don't tell, and make sure there are no traceable transactions from the U.S. to your offshore tax jurisdiction, no mail, no wires, no traceable cheques."
1,Lacks substance on implementation,"The book introduces the concepts associated with off-shore havens, but does little beyond that. Certainly, off-shore havens can be used by individuals and corporations for a variety of benefits, but the author does not adequately discuss implementing those benefits. Also, there's a lot of hype and questionable tax advice for U.S. residents. My advice is to retain an accountant and an attorney with a history of specializing in international taxation and commerce, as opposed to a ""consultant"" whose tax and legal credentials are unknown. This book is probably not the one you want to buy, but I would encourage people interested in the subject to not give up hope, tax havens are worth it."
3,Too general. Too much self advertising.,"One of the book's first page titles is ""how to..."" and all I wanted is to better understand mechanics of tax minimization structures and how they actually work. All I could find in the book is ""this can be done, but call an expert or better yet call me"". I agree experts are needed but I'd like to have a glimpse of their concepts and knowledge first, but obviously they won't share it for $...."
1,The author was convicted for giving out this advice...,"Don't waste your money.The author is a sham artist. He was convicted, and in a plea bargain handed over his entire client list to the US Governtment. None of the advice in this book is legal or legitimate."
1,You are not going to make milions,"This book is short on details. It lists, Money Havens but at the same time does not give a complete picture. Except ""do your own due diligence."
5,thought provoking,Very interesting book with information presented so that anyone can understand the concepts. It was very thougth provoking and its good to know that I am not the only one who feel they pay too much in taxes.
5,very helpful in answering questions,"This book helped me to fill in the gaps and answer the questions I was left with after reading other authors books on the same subject. This book was very informative, concise and well put together. I found it to be an excellent backdrop as well as a useful tool for future investment planning."
5,Very good gate,"This gate is not flimsy as some of these reviews state. AT least I didn't find it so. It worked for us. I had to cordone a cat I rescued from my Bengal cats due to her being ill and the gate worked perfectly. I highly recommend. You don't need to pay a really high price for a gate. Because cats jump, we needed the height this gate offers and they're hard to find. Good product and highly recommended. Delivery was prompt as well."
4,"Works like it should, fits a wide range of doors.","I bought this to separate old pets from new pets until they got use to each other. It is nice that it can be used in a lot of places, since it fits a wide range of openings."
3,Way too flexible,"Okay, it's a gate. It will keep your pets off the stairs or out of the kitchen, but if you tighten it enough to keep a beagle at bay (pun intended) it will beat the heck out of the walls or door frame on each side of it."
1,Did not work as advertised,"This item did not work as advertised. No matter what I tried, it did not pressure-mount, and I have a hard time imagining how it would create tension by ""pressing down the locking bar"" as the instructions described. Sending it back."
2,It worked great... Then this happened.,"Length:: 0:25 MinsWe bought the supergate for our cat to block him from running around the living room and destroying our in-progress jigsaw puzzles. I purchased the product knowing very well that our cat might be able to clear the gate, which he did. So I ordered a second supergate to double the height of the ""cat prison"". Presented in the video is our little Houdini clearing both supergates with ease.For nimble cats, this product fails. It might be fine for babies and dogs."
3,not working for poodles,it is not working for my minipoodle. He jumpe easily out of the gate. I think the mesh supported him to climbed on it and helped him to jump.
1,I did not like this gate at all,"This gate was worthless to me. It did not stay upright and it was hard to open and close it. I did not like it at all. I had to send it back. Sorry, but true."
1,not functional,"This gate is not functional with baseboards that stick out more than 1/2 in. Also, the locking mechanism is shoddy and not as effective as I hoped."
4,Nice Gate,"This gate is working out great. It is very strong and sturdy. It is better than the plastic gate we bought prior. So far we haven't any problems, except getting used to how to lock it in place. I recommend it!"
4,Worked well for my purposes,"I bought two of these gates to help me introduce two cats. They really worked quite well for pressure gates, and were completely effortless to set up. One of the cats, who weighs about 10 pounds, would climb up the gates (we had them two high). He had to climb up it at least 10 times before the top gate finally slipped out of the door frame under his weight. I would think it would be great for dogs and kids also. It won't require you to mess up your walls with hardware installation and the price is right. I wouldn't use it at the top of the stairs, though, just in case a child was able to push it loose."
5,great album,"I've been looking for this one for YEARS!! I've worn out two tapes, and only wished I could get it on cd. The title track Rocks! This is typical 80's, if you like 80's music, you like this album. Modern Day Dehlila was the only hit, but all the other songs are great. My favorite would be the title track, next All American Boy."
3,Chevy Gold Bowtie Mud Flaps,These look great the instructions to install were less than desirable but once you figure out how to do it your self they went on easy note you must take off the rear tires to install.
2,Alternative use,I picked up a Foci Card holder as well. I have kept this one as a standby cause it really doesnt look that good.
5,a rare find!,"If you're a fan of Civil War history, and General Meade in particular, then I highly recommend this book! I can't find too many books about Meade. Meade never wrote a memoir, but this book has a lot of detail and information for any fan of George Meade. The price was right and the book itself is very good quality and should be in any Civil War fan or admirer of George Meade's collection."
3,An OK read about the real general at Gettysburg.,"As the author relates, there are few good biographies about Meade, who actually led the Union army of the Potamic from Gettysburg to the end of the war. Perhaps it was because he was a solid patriot who fought for conviction and did not seek the limelight. He even had reporters arrested, and they banded together and vowed not to mention him in newspaper articles. He even paraded one out of Army camp on a donkey to make an example of him.This gives a little insight to the hero of Gettysburg. I learned a little about this great man. Solid, smart, and soft spoken were his attributes, and the common soldier loved him."
5,The Intimidator was a man we all loved.,"Dale Earnhardt : Remembering the IntimidatorI love this book, for it lets you see about who the intimidator really was. If you are a true Dale Earnhardt fan, you will want this book. You won't be wasting your money. It is a great find, for any dale earnhardt collection."
4,slightly dissapointing compared to previous version (Natures Orange),"The original (Natures Orange by Treewax used to buy at Home Depot) was the best cleaner/degreaser I have used. Easy on skin and I even used to wash vegetables. This product is decent but is not as viscous, does not smell as orangy and does not clean quite as well. It seems to have more detergent and other synthetic chemicals and I am concerned about using it to wash fruits and vegetables. Still one of the best products but no longer the best."
4,A bit oily but does the job,"This is a bit on the oily side but does the job. Scent is heavier on the orange side but for what I use it for, cover up scent is a good thing!"
2,Meh!,"This is definitely not a Citrasolve replacement.Not that it's advertised as such, but that was what I was looking for.It's degreasing properties are definitely lacking."
1,Worst item that I ever bought,"Purchased about 2006. Within a year, terrible sound, picture got worse. Warranty guy replaced speakers , board, bulb, color wheel. Ok for about 2 years, then needed a new bulb. In 2012 color wheel shattered into peices. Replaced wheel & bulb myself ($130) with the helpful how-to from jangro.com. ($400 + if you call repaiman) Color wheel lasted 4 hours, then shattered again. Samsung DLP's have a history of problems. Don't buy one, new or used."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV!!!!,I have owned this model for almost three years. This model is flawed. I will be replacing the color wheel for the second time. I have yet to replace the lamp. My repair man states that this is a common problem with this model. Samsung has yet to resolve this issue.I will have to replace the color wheel ($350) every three years...this is not worth it.
5,"Ahhhh yes, memories from high school","I played this game in high school back in 98-99 and LOVED it. I was so glad I was able to find it. I'm sure I paid a lot more than what it cost back then but hey, if you want a hard to find product, you sometimes have to pay more.It also plays just fine on my Windows XP computer. I didn't need to adjust any settings or run it in compatibility mode.I would highly recommend this game but once you start playing it, you might find it hard to turn it off."
1,Library Clerk II,"I purchased this workbook/study quide for a Civil Service exam of the same title. However, NOT 1 section of the workbook was on the exam. Was extremely disappointed, not only that I spent $25.00 on the book, but that I spent a good deal of time studying information, that I ultimately didn't use at all on the exam!!!"
3,An Okay Read.,"I never heard of Furst, but Dark Voyage was well-reviewed in, I think, the New York Times, so I bought it, being particularly interested in the period and the locales, most of which I have visited. Briefly, a good story, well told, but ultimately somewhat disappointing because of the unclear and uninteresting ending. My final reaction: there was no purpose to the book, the characters were somewhat interesting, but stereotyped, and the plot is replicated in numerous movies and books."
2,Not worth reading,"I am a big fan of Alan Furst and have read every one of his novels. Dark Voyage simply does not measure up, and, in my opinion, is not worth the time. If you want to read Alan Furst, choose one of his older works and give this one a pass. If you choose Dark Voyage as your first novel by Furst, I promise you it will be your last."
3,Hopefully his previous work is better than this,"Alan Furst makes up for a mediocre first 200 pages with a heart-thumping, adrenaline-pumping ending. This was the first book of his that I have read, so I won't pass judgment on him as a writer just yet. Perhaps his earlier books were better than this one, which was entertaining at times, especially in the final chase and battle scene, but otherwise left me disappointed. There really wasn't a whole lot of suspense in this book, not much intrigue, and not much in the way of character development. It certainly had potential but never seemed to take advantage of it. The main character, Eric DeHaan, has the essential elements of a hero, yet we don't get deep enough into his psyche to really relate to him. And other than in the final scene, there is no build-up of anticipation that one would expect from a spy thriller. This book has the feel of a novel that could have been much more if the author had spent more time and effort on it."
2,Boring!,"One word describes this book- BORING! I know that most of Alan Furst's novels are slow, but at least they have a plot that keeps your interest. Here, you have a merchant captain from Norway, of all places, who is roped into undergoing different missions for the war effort. None of which are very dangerous, nor worthy of the telling. Not only that, the vessel captain is a worn out nobody that doesn't deserve our respect, let alone our interest. I look forward to every new Furst book that comes out, but this one was a disappointment."
3,Disappointing for Furst,"I am a reader of Furst, and I found this book to be disappointing compared to the other novels by him. Without disclosing the details of the plot, this novel lacked the detail and the moral ambiguity often found in Furst's novels. There seemed to be a number of inconsistencies, and I felt like the story was rushed. He is such a wonderful evocative writer that perhaps I have higher standards, but I was disappointed by this work."
4,Shadows of Casablanca,"In Dark Voyage, Furst sweeps his characters up in an ambiguous atmosphere that resides along the edges of WWII, a moodiness that brought shades of 'Casablanca' to mind. It would not have seemed out of place had a Rick Blaine or Victor Laszlo shipped a passage on Furst's 'Noordendam'. But this is essentially what drives the book. Furst creates some interesting characters, but they pass through the novel like the ship they are on. Nothing really is resolved. They simply experience their slice of WWII, ponder its significance, but their future lives are left open for the reader to imagine. Still, Furst's style is wonderfully evocative of the period and the book, ultimately, was a pleasure to read."
4,Great writing ...,"A friend gave me this book to read and I thought it was great writing throughout ... the author is no novice ... if not for the fact espionage does very little for me, this would be a five star review, but it's my inability to get excited about anything spy that left me wanting in the end. I did enjoy reading about the Swedish coastline during WWII because of having read The 900 Days (about the seige of Leningrad) and how the nazi's had mined all the surrounding waters, so it was enjoyable to be somewhat familiar with that material. Once again, the writing was superb ... espionage just isn't my cup of tea."
5,No one is better,"Yes, this gets five stars for the individual story but more significantly all his books get five stars. This one stands out for me because of the library the ship captain takes with him. And the beautiful women he seduces all the time.Enjoy them all"
2,Basic WWII Spy Thriller,Basic espionage thriller where the base of operations is a tramp steamer in the Dutch navy. The ship's captain is recruited to aid the allies in several small missions against the Axis powers in Europe. Standard fare; light on plots and character development.
4,Best of the Furst I have read so far,"Better character development than I have previously encountered.Better, pardon the pun, ""flow"" to the plot.There is an actual beginning and end, and there are details in between to make the story line clear."
3,Admiral,Quick easy read. The plot was good and really kept my interest. I would recommend this novel to readers who enjoy WWII novels.
4,On the high seas with Furst,"In Dark Voyage, Alan Furst proves he's just as adept at crafting an atmospheric WWII thriller at sea as he is on land. He's clearly done his research- you can picture the trusty but creaky old Noordendam in your mind. The main character Eric Dehaan is a typically laconic and humane Furstian hero (and that's a good thing). He and his polyglot crew are thrust by events into a mission that, if successful, will bring the Allies one little step closer to winning the war. I'm holding back one star because the shipboard romance between Dehaan and Maria seems awkward."
5,Kentucky Cavaliers in Dixie,"This work is more of spin off work from the Diary of Edward O. Guerrant who served with this book's author during the Civil War. Musgrove supplements Guerrant's Diary which has been recently publlshed under the title ""Bluegrass Confederate"" Edited by William C. Davis. Both works fill in the gaps about the actions that were fought in Southwest Virginia and East Tennessee where the Official Records are silent. Aside from a few local histories this book is one of the few that has such information. Highly recommended for students of this area of the conflict."
1,Garbage,"This music is garbage, plain and simple. Honestly, the song writing is horrible. Lyrics? Well if the lyrics ""when I see you now, I look into your eyes and fade away. I don't know what to say"" sound poetic to you then get this album. To the rest of us sain persons, avoid at all costs. Although their guitar player is REAL cool about getting his strings broken by superior bands so maybe I should be easy on them. Nah, junk is junk, and I just can't lie. Even if you like the bands listed in the other review below don't think you will like this."
4,Informative,"Extremely informative. I thought that the book was written a while back so with the moving, cutting edge science field maybe some of the information may not be up-to-date. However, I was wrong, this book is well written, extremely informative and very technical. Non-science readers may get dazzled with some of the terminology, nonetheless, there's nothing that Google or Wikipedia can't clearly explain. Good Stuff!"
3,Not what I expected.. My fault.. I should have done more research.,I was expecting a totally different take on the Power of Place. I have not finished reading it.. I promise I will though.. Can NOT leave a book unfinished
4,review,For anyone who lost a family member in this conflict this is a must read. For families coping with trying to get information and then closure to the loss of their child or brother this book offers hope in showing how families have dealt with and overcome obstacles in resolving and bringing closure to an emotional void in their lives.
5,timeless,"This is timeless, beautiful music that can be listened to for ages.It's funny to consider that this was considered ""pop"" music back in the day; all I know is that pop music sure don't sound this good nowadays. Every song is melodically beautiful, classically arranged, and delivered with Brenda's unmistakeable,TO DIE-FOR delivery.She doesn't have the strongest voice in the world-but there's that something-that raspy undertone mixed with sweet sassiness and sultry swoops that makes up for any lack of range or strength that she may have.Absolutely timeless,unforgettable music-each song greater than the last."
4,Music from my Youth,"It`s always nice to listen to good music connected to good memories.Brenda Lee has this powerful, and soft voice that expresses the lyrics so brilliant!"
2,Meh...,"Remember a couple years ago on MTV? That cover band challenge they had? remember the winning band, Strangers with Candy? they were an awesome good old fashioned hard rock band with great vocals. very original. Well, they ditched the originality, changed their name to Lifer, and put out this piece of generic nu metal that you can't tell from anything else.There are some good songs on here but in a couple years only the best nu metal acts with remain and these guys really don't have what it takes."
3,"O.K., but nothing remarkable","They're not really that heavy, which was a big dissapointment. The music is slow and at times boring. The vocals are generic and get tiresome. The only thing that gets the album 3 stars is that the guitars and bass are better than your average nu-metal act."
1,musical failure #123442335445323 this year,"Yay! Yet another band I wish would never have happened. This album reeks of poor imatation, and it doesn't work either! Lump this one in the huge pile of horrible bands this year."
1,Sound Alikes,not only does he sound like Jon Davis and Phil but try Lejon Witherspoon. This band sucks I live in there home town and they suck. the only ppl who like them are the fakes nad females becuase there cute. They have no musical talent what so ever. I play guitar myself and there songs are just too easy. They started out as a cover band and will always be a cover band.... Applaud MTV for getting them signed.
4,"""No need for anyone to show me how . . .""","This is actually a pretty good CD. It's got some repetitive guitar riffs, but I don't seem to mind every time I listen. It does sound a bit depressing in some moments, so it's not for everybody. Personally, I think it's a good rock CD by a good band. My favorite songs here are ""No Need,"" ""Not Like You,"" and ""Breathless."" ""No Need"" and ""Not Like You"" especially give me goosebumps; the choruses sound very heavenly, even if the entire CD isn't really very heavenly. I know this CD hasn't been very successful since its release, but I won't ever throw this CD away even if I had to."
5,Some good [edit],"This [edit] [edit]ing rocks man. I mean, I knew that they wee loud, hard, and offensivew but this [edit] is absolutely great and unexpected. This one deffinately gets my seal.-FM"
4,GOOD....read on!,"i cant belive people are out there bitching about good music. Just cause you dont like doesnt mean i wont, so you know what i say? Shutup. If you can make better sounding music, Do it...If not, quit your whining and thank god he blessed you with the skills of a dead-end , white collar job...Oh yeah, and if you said youve heard this before, you havent apparently."
1,Extremely patronizing book,"Chesler's tone is so patronizing here. Third wave feminists did not just step out of a cave, the older amongst us (those now in our later 30's to early 40's like myself) saw these events unfold as children and it's throughly seared in our minds. Ms. Chesler ignores the fact that in the 1987 March for Reproductive Rights on Washington DC, in which 500,000 women marched, 2/3 were then under 30 years old (the third wave feminists, this was our first major- in numbers present, activist appearence) This book tempted me to write a letter FROM a young feminist. But I decided not to, because if Ms. Chesler was determined to ignore third wave feminists, despite much activism by us, a letter refuting her claims of our ignorance wasn't going to open her eyes. Readers are better to choose books by second wave feminists that are better written and informed, like Gloria Steinem's. I'd also recommend books by older third wavers like Naomi Wolf and Susan Faludi."
5,Kingston 1 GB MMC+ memory card,Excellent product from long-time player in memory products. This memory card in my Nokia cell phone gives me nearly limitless storage for all types of media files. The pricing was very good and I will not hesitate to look to Kingston Technologies for future memory storage needs.
2,"Good ideas, but not the best book","THere are some very good ideas in this book, but they are poorly executed. The writing is pedestrian, the characters are two-dimensional, except for Rat, and the action sequences aren't very clear. Jeff is a very, very whiney child who does nothing but complain in front of his stereotypically preoccupied parents. The worst thing about this book is the repetitive references to the Captain being fat. Kids do not need to be encouraged when it comes to fat jokes, and given the high requirements for physical fitness in space, it is highly doubtful that there would be a fat Captain. The ""jokes"" add nothing to the plot. There is likely to be a sequel; I am hoping it will be better."
2,"Well Written, but dated utility.","While the premise of the book and the foundation are good, the utility is lost and revealed as dated with the suggested resources. I would look for a more contemporary publishing date or simply move on to a different author."
4,Works for my dog and fits narrow openings,I’m using this gate to keep my dog in the bathroom while I’m away from the house. The gate requires you to drill into the wall/frame and screw in 4 loops where the gate will attach. I picked this one specifically because my bathroom door is 24” and there didn’t seem to be a huge selection of gates that were that narrow. This one fits perfectly. It’s pretty easy to open and close but you do have to make sure the bottom hook catches the loop which can make it more difficult to open and close with one hand. Not impossible though.If you are using this for dogs and your dog likes to chew you may want to consider a metal one. The gate is wood and I come home to piles of wood shavings where my dog has been chewing on it. Something I didn't even think about him doing!
2,"good idea, good price, bad hardware","Purchased this gate to use to keep my son from climbing steps. It is fairly strong, easily adaptable, but a flawed design. Having to hook 2 latches is difficult, contrary to the pictures on the box. You could never operate the latches with one hand and a baby on your hip. The springs in the stick, sometimes won't latch, sometimes won't let go. Worst of all, my wife cut a large gash in her hand on the ""safe"" plastic section. Good idea, POOR hardware. Needs serious work to make this functional. Going to build yet another baby gate myself due to lack of cost effective, SAFE options on the market."
4,Worth the money,"It's nice and tall, which is great if you have dogs. I liked the top plastic covers, but if you move the gate from room to room and have to adjust the width, you'll find the plastic covers don't come together well. It can be a struggle to get them to nest inside one another. I just might remove them altogether since I don't have kids."
2,Not what I expected,"I ordered this product hoping it would be the perfect solution to keep my baby boy from going up the stairs. The bottom of my stairs is in a kind of crowded area and I wanted the gate to expand and contract to fit into a small area when not in use. Unfortunately, the gate stays very large and doesn't swing like I thought it would. I returned it before even trying to install. Disappointed this wasn't a good solution. Back to the drawing board."
4,good for the money,It does exactly what I wanted it to do. It keeps the dog out of the rooms I don't want her to go.
4,Perfect for our tall dogs,"For well behaved dogs that don't jump on things, this gate is perfect. Not sure it would be sturdy enough for more agressive dogs."
2,Swing gate,"This is a good gate for large openings. I needed a gate to keep my small dog off the carpet. The big drawback is the screws included to install the gate to the wall. You receive four small eye screws. After numerous holes in the wall trying to keep it in place, I finally gave up and now use it to block a smaller area. The screws stay in place if screwed directly into molding but don't bother connecting directly to sheetrock."
3,not the safest option,"You should be aware that Consumers' Reports recommends against this type of gate, because the folding diamonds of the main gate section can pinch fingers, heads, and everything else. Might be fine where you're going to keep a constant eye, but not the best option for a high-usage area where you expect the containment to keep the kid safe..."
2,Sticking latches and weak hardware,"Having to close off our kitchen from our one-year-old was proving problematic due to an unusual opening (angled and wide), and ultimately we decided on this gate, as every other alternative cost well over $100. After just two days of use I found myself wishing we had spent the extra money; the locking mechanism is awkward and time consuming, and the ""4 point steel mounting hardware"" (eye hooks that screw into the wall) have already become stressed and faulty."
5,2 Large Dogs- Fantastic,"We have a large door way and this product is awesome. Easy to install and keeps the two dogs well contained. I bought 2 gates and one is awesome, the others top plastic slider gets stuck and doesn't slide by itself but I can get it to go over- still worth the money. Its cool I can leave the gate up and just put it against the wall vs. taking it up and down- Best part- you cant trip over any rail across the floor because there are none!!"
3,Get's the Job Done,"This gate gets the job done, but it is a little cumbersome and the latches are not easy to operate and are hard on the hands.Would probably buy again."
2,Only buy for smaller openings!!,"At first we liked this gate. It was easy to install and did its purpose. We didn't even mind that it was a little tricky to latch at times. We used this to cover a 4 ft opening. It broke after only a few months of use. The bigger the opening, the more flimbsy the gate gets. Good luck if you go with this gate!!"
1,Posers.,"Yes, that's all there is to it. This is sterile, outdated, boring crap that borrows heavily from equally sterile, outdated, boring crappy bands like Judas priest and AC/DC. Listen to Melodic death metal like 90s Death, Amon amarth, At the gates, Arch enemy, In flames, Dark tranquility, and Carcass' Heartwork instead of this cliched trash. Peace out mullethead Iron maiden t-shirt wearing duuuuudz!"
5,Restless & Wild is Correct,"What can I say about this CD? It contains Restless & Wild, Fast as a Shark, Princess of the Dawn, etc. This is the best disk you can get by Accept. Buy it today."
4,FAST AS A SHARK!,"Accept and Judas Priest were arguably the biggest influences on the NWOBHM and speed metal in general, and I must say Restless and Wild is one of those albums that will make you forget who is in the room and incite random headbanging sessions. There are no pompous jaggoffs attempting to show off or expand your mind here... just pure 100% HEAVY METAL.Fast as a Shark and the title track kick things off with a back to back speed metal assault.. Udo sounds like a constipated granny, of course, but that's the beauty of it all. There are a few slower, hard rock oriented numbers (move your head, neon nights) but they rock hard all the same.I have never worn leather/studs in my life... this album makes me want to. Hail to Accept."
5,Accept!!!,"I'm one of the few ""privileged"" who have seen Accept live in Germany 12 times, and folks you have missed one of THE BEST shows on earth! Udo Dirkschneider is definitely the driver of the band-for a small dude he makes his PRESENCE known! The twin white flying V's, driving bass, overworked drummer and the pyrotechnics makes Metallica look like a garage band. Check out their videos on youtube! I'm on here re-ordering Accept CD's on account mine are worn out!"
3,Still trying to find their sound,"Contrary to the glowing reviews below me, this is definitely not a five star album. The band was obviously still trying to find their own sound when they put this out. For example, one song sounds like ACDC, another sounds like Iron Maiden, another like Judas Priest. The good songs are pretty good though, especially the title cut. Side two of the album is nothing special at all. Get Balls to the Wall if you want vintage Accept- this is really nothing too special or original."
3,A classic metal album? Gimme a break!,"Okay - this album has its strong points. The title cut is one of the best songs Accept ever wrote, but at least half this decent (at best) album are nothing special AT ALL. In fact, overall this is a very mediocre album by a band still trying to find their sound (they found it on Balls to the Wall). The truth is, the only exceptional song on the album is the title cut - if not for that song this album might have gotten 2 stars. The other nine tunes define mediocrity. Worth being in any 80's metalhead's collection, but first try and find it at the discount store."
3,PERFECT CONCEPT,"The music fan from Irvine, CA, defined ACCEPT perfectly and in a sincere manner. This German band was always a kind of Dokken, for example: you just couldn't feel real emotion in their playing or their silly lyrics. They are a kind of worsened Scorpions. And the singer, Udo...uau !!! The guy just can't sing, it's a shame ACCEPT had Udo as their singer, since musically ACCEPT had good musicians (WOlf Hoffmann being a melodic a tenlented guitar player ). Well, but that happpened with AC/DC too, when they hired Brian Johnson.... Anyway, none of the above means RESTLESS AND WILD is a bad album. IT is not. Just forget Udo's ""voice"" and you'll discover marvellous riffing and original metal."
3,"Good, but not great (just like 80's metal)","Ok, hold on now, let's not gush too much about this album. Yes, this is a good 80's metal album, but to give it five stars is a bit much. (Can any 80's metal album garner five?) What you get with this album is an above average and faster version of Judas Priest. But this is not a bad thing. Yes, the songs ""Fast as a Shark,"" ""Restless and Wild,"" and ""Princess of the Dawn,"" are above average cuts, but the rest of the numbers are adequate rockers at best. The key to this album is that eventhough there are limited stellar tracks, there is not one bad song. Four stars is too high of a rating while three stars is too low. A worthy used disc purchase."
4,"New book, new author, great book.","This book has something to please many different interests. It has excitment,crime,romance and even a spiritual side. Looking forward to this authors next book."
3,Slow pace but worth it!,"The movie is quite good if you give it a chance. It actually starts on a very slow pace and one gets the impression that the movie is not very developped. But things pick up as you go along. Maurice Chevalier's remarks are humorous and charming. Olympia's estate has great decor and wonderful furniture. I happen to love John Gavin, and I think he is a good actor. Angela Lansbury does her best to intimidate, but we still love her. She's priceless. And as for Sophia... you have got to watch..."
5,A Breath of Scandal,"A movie from memory, well done without being overdone. Liked the story and the acting. It's a lightweight but entertaining. This film was of personal significance and finally found its way to my collection. I'm a Sophia Loren fan and enjoy her portrayals. If you are to, then try this one."
3,Une bonne petite comédie satirique légère,"C'est l'histoire d'un ingénieur américain, John Foster, qui arrive en automobile en Autriche dans les années 1910 pour convaincre l'empereur d'Autriche d'installer une usine d'électrolyse pour fabriquer de l'aluminium. Au passage, il rencontre une belle inconnue qui est en réalité la Princesse Olympia (Sophia Lauren) qui disparat mystérieusement. Arrivé à Vienne, il cherche à rencontrer le Prince Philip (Maurice Chevalier) a qui il doit remettre une lettre d'introduction de la part de l'ambassadeur d'Autriche à Washington mais il se heurte au protocole. Le Prince Philip est également le père de la Princesse Olympia. Finalement, après quelques péripéties, la Princesse Olympia se sauve en Amérique avec John Foster."
1,like sophia but not in this film,waste of money. i don't think i even watched the whole thing. ridiculous plot and horrible acting.
1,Wrong Product shipped,"I ordered Double Density Diskettes, which you initially acknowledged. You shipped high density diskettes. I have no use for the 100 high desnity diskettes and would appreciate your correcting your error.Robert L. Seabright2950 Kane RdLeland,Ill 60531If you will send my correct order, I will return the incorrect item by return mail."
4,Excellent Survey,"I just started this and, so far, it's an excellent survey of Hughes's work. Love the vibrancy & passion of his modern verse. So much history, emotion, and conviction here. If you are not familiar with his work, this might be a good start.He's vital to American Literature."
5,Excellent overview of every aspect of the writing business.,"As a full-time freelance writer, former editor, and former publisher, I haven't gotten this excited about a new writing book in a long time. This isn't just another tired overview of the same articles on the same topics; this book is packed with in-depth information on every aspect of the writing business. It paid for itself immdiately in providing me with valuable references and information that helped me with a current project; it should be on every writer's bookshelf"
3,Nothing special,"I looked through this book and sent it back. Nothing new, just the usual info so while it might help if you're just starting out, there are lots of similar books out there - the title's a little misleading, it doesn't really take the place of attending a writer's conference."
5,Talk about great quality and at an amazing price.,"Van Gogh has always been one of my most favorite painters, second to only Vermeer. The quality of the bookmarks are amazing and the color is absolutely beautiful. These are larger than I thought they would be. They come in a little booklet and you can detach them one at a time so it keeps the remaining ones organized. I will be buying more of these for the other artist. You can't go wrong with the price."
4,Really interesting read,"This book was recommended by a professor who recently passed away. Before his passing, he was introduced to Samuel Ullman and fell in love with his work. Because he was such an inspiration, I wanted to know more about Samuel Ullman and read more of his work. This book is the perfect mix!"
1,Next To Useless,"I live within the city limits of one of the flattest places in the world, Jacksonville, Florida. I bought this to replace the cheesy dipole antenna that came with an Akai mini stereo system that was having difficulty picking up local AM/FM radio stations. I installed this and...guess what?...almost no difference, no matter how you moved the LED's with the two rotary dials. The strongest FM station in town (8 miles away) came in a touch better with less static, but that was about it. Can a product that cost what this does be more unworkable?Audiovox should be ashamed.I'm now going to explore You Tube for some of those antenna videos using a 2x4 and coat hangers..."
1,The Anti-Antenna,"Don't waste your money on this antenna. I purchased this antenna and put it on the highest perch in my living room and did not hear any appreciable difference between an equivalent length of lamp cord and this ""booster"" antenna. Very disappointed."
1,AF-1 FM Antenna,In my opinion it's not good at all less than 1 star. Spent a lot of time trying to get it zeroed in but it just don't work. Barely better than nothing at best. John
2,"good packaging, slick design, but does it do anything?","I bought the Terk antenna in an attempt to pick up some AM and FM radio stations I was struggling with on my new bookshelf stereo system. Perhpas because of my apartment building, or the quality of the stereo, the antenna didn't offer me much success in picking up stations any better than the factory-provided antenna. I did notice improvement in the static (or lack of it) on stations that were already tuning in fairly well (they went from great to excellent), but the stations that were tuning in ""poorly"" got no better with the Terk antenna. Overall, it was probably not worth the money paid."
2,You're better off with the cheaper tower,I bought this antenna to replace a Terk tower antenna I had in my office that wasn't able to pick up AM stations very well. It turned out that I was MUCH better off with the tower. This thing didn't pick the AM stations well at all. I immediately returned this thing and went back to the tower.
1,Not a good choice for me,This product was not very good at all. I live in North Jersey where the signal for common metro area stations are poor. My car gets better reception than this antenna. This was not a good product. I wouldn't reccommend it to anyone. I only give it one star because I cannot give it a lower rating. Otherwise I would give it a ZERO.
4,Works for Me,"I live in a suburban area where reception from the nearest major cities (about 20-30 miles away) is largely blocked by a range of hills.Although I did not try a simple loop-type antenna, when I connected this Terk antenna, I was able to get 4-bars (signal strength indicator on the tuner) out of five in broad-band mode and 5 bars in ""Pin-Dot"" (narrow-band) mode, on a relatively weak FM station I was interested in. I did not need to set the antenna gain on maximum in either case to get these results. I am satisfied that the antenna works well for me for FM in my situation.I haven't used the AM antenna."
2,Not so good,"For the price I expected more. The AM antenna is not powered, non-amplified. The FM antenna works great. The wires are too short. It can not be moved far from the Receiver. It has no on off switch. It has to be adjusted for every station."
1,MISLEADING TITLE,"When I saw the title of this book my expectation was to see examples of using Wavelets. The title uses the word 'Numerical'. It really should read 'Theoretical'. For those seeking applications of Wavelets, I do not recommend this book."
3,Light-hearted,"Anjali Kumar is tired of being psychic. She just wants to live her own life and be left alone by both her family and her unwanted talent. A ghost hunter, Scott, changes her mind and they team up with a Southern drifter Coulter (telekinetic) to rid houses of spooks and other entitities.It's a light-hearted read and I did find it entertaining. However, there seemed to be some holes in the dialogue and the plot quickly drifted from one case to another without another word. One minute they were dealing with an evil ghost and the next they were checking their messages for the next. What happened? It's a quick read, the characters are likeable but without much substance."
3,Good text on Mystical Christianity's liturgical year.,"It can be a little dated and even sexist in spots, but the overall scope of this little text can be very useful to those seeking a more metaphysical approach with their religious practices. It is a little more Christian-focused than much else of Ms. Fortune's works, but I found it to be a useful addition to my collection of her esoteric works."
3,Not Too Helpful,"I picked up this book as the cover and title intrigued me. The introduction was a scant preamble to the thinking in the book. Frankly, however, I was hoping to find something more challenging and scholarly. The writing was short and cursory. As a teacher, I could find little that was useful to my adult students. Any person who spent some time with the collects could have written equal commentaries. I was also disappointed to note that the author is using outdated versions of the collects or perhaps collects from the Church of England. These have little utility for Americans. It would have been more helpful to use the collects from the Book of Common Prayer or the Lutheran Book of Worship."
1,Returned Item it was VCR I ordered DVD did not get a refund!!,I purchased what I thought was a DVD of John Candy's Only the Lonely. I was sent a VCR recording. I do not have a VCR. I returned it requesting a refund or a VCR recording of Only the Lonely. I have not received anything from this venor. I am truly disappointed and out of the $$.
4,John Candy and Maureen O'Hara!,Love Maureen O'Hara. Why couldn't she be in more movies? Her timing and delivery of the lines are perfection. John Candy does well also. Pleasure to watch and good for a great laugh.
4,Talking wrist blood pressure monitor,"The product was delivered promptly, exactly as describe in literature. The voice is clear, loud and very easily understood. I was disappointed in that the measurements were in mm of hg However I disconnected the battery andreconnected it and the unit has worked as described, since. I am happy with it."
5,Great wedding gift!,"This will last longer than most marriages! It mentioned BBQ, but I use mine for pastry, carving meat, you name it! Indispensable if you love to cook."
4,...a pleasure all year round...,"And the out and out winners in this years Christmas special are Christian rockers Three Days Wait who have put together an enthralling set of new songs reaffirming the real message of Christmas.Working in the classic rock idiom of Dave Matthews Band and Collective Soul, these are songs that will be a pleasure to listen to at any time of the year. There's a funky Spin Doctors type vibe to a lot of the material topped off wih the rich voice of Nathan Wagner.They jump genres sometimes with the delightful and self explanatory 'Snow Blues' and 'Blue Grass Christmas' and deftly drop some traditional lyrical motifs into some of th songs to aid assimilation.A delightful record."
5,Lucy shares her stories and heart with us,"Several friends and I went to a recent concert of hers. By the end, two of my friends had tears in their eyes. Her songs are beautiful, personal, and authentic. Her voice is very distinctive and expressive. She tells her stories and those of her family in a way that resonates with the experiences of her audience. The emotions and the music are hers, but we are all richer for the gift she gives us."
5,Lucy: Over the Hills,"Lucy has been my favorite artist for years. Her lyrics are from her own personal experience, and some recent deaths, an adoption of a daughter from China, and general melancholy set the tone for some of her music. For me, this makes it very rich. I am a Christian, and though she is Jewish, I find her work very redeemable because (like Flannery O'Conner, but in a very different way) she states reality as it is, without romanticism. She is amazing in concert, if you ever have the chance to see her!"
4,Another great installment,Another great set of stories set to music. Lucy's storytelling by song is beautiful and flows.
4,Lucy Kaplansky - Over the Hills - New CD,"I adore Lucy K - and own all her albums. She has done a stellar job on Over the Hills. The only album that may be better is still the incredible Flesh and Bone. If you like Lucy, you will certainly appreciate owning this new one. If you are new to Lucy, perhaps start with Flesh and Bone and then come to this one. You won't be sorry."
3,If you miss Queen...,"...this isn't a bad tribute. I bought this because there are some recognisable musicians here who have done their best to sing and play Queen. Ain't nothing wrong with that. Great songs are great songs even if these guys don't sound like Freddy. I didn't buy it expecting they would. What captures the Queen spirit though is Lemmy's version of Tie Your Mother Down. Most people don't get it, but Lemmy personifies the song. And Ted Nugent blazes on the guitar. Here's to Queen anyways...."
3,Not for the timid or the faint of heart....,"Fourty three miniuts of classic; definately British Rock, with a mild Blues riff thrown at ""We Will Rock You /We Are The Champions"" breaking the monotony. As a true blue Queen fan, I find each of the 11 recordings would stand alone as excellent works as single releases; collectively however they are boreing. No suprises, little improvisation and damn little imagination. A quick look at the list of performers tells the whole story.These guys play it one way and only one way. The only real credit in the recording goes to some of the best lead guitar work I have heard in a long time. Chris Impellitteri, John Petrucci, Bruce Kulick and Ted Nugent will wear you out. Most remarkable, is the final revelation after you complete the marithon thru these eleven tracks, is appreicating how extraordinary Queen really was..."
1,No Thanx...,"One word: TRIBUTE! This album is a dedication to Queen, the heroes of the glam-rock scene. I mean, come on! I thought these songs were terribly recreated. If you're gonna do something, do it right! The original was perfection, why mess with it? I did see good in what they were TRYING to do. Queen was, and is, the best band ever. I'm glad people have seen what they've done is really great, and have given them some recognition for it. But with this, they may as well not have!"
2,fairytaleaficcionado,"interesting, well documented, with marvelous illustrations.Definitely a good buy for adults who still dream of fairy tales characters. It is a pity that the collection does not include stories from ""One thousand and one nights"". Otherwise it will be perfect and complete."
3,sparce annotations,"This book has much fewer annotations compared to the author's Andersen book. You will not get as much insight into the stories compared to the Andersen book. If you are buying it to get a better insight into the stories, you will be disappointed. This book needs a second edition with three times as many annotations."
2,DON'T BUY IT FOR THE PICTURES!,"The text has something to recommend it in that it does give biographies of the collectors of fairy tales and the classic illustrators it uses. However, the reproductions of the pictures are all the size of about 2 and 1/2 by 2 and 1/2 inches! I own many of them in other illustrated books in a much larger format and the illustrations here are AWFUL! The colors are off and most of them are much too dark. Buy the book for the text if you like, but NOT FOR THE PICTURES."
4,goddess around the earth,"I beautiful picture book of brief information about the different goddess,but overall a nice book to add to your other ""goddess"" collection.Gail Howell"
4,Great mythology,"This is a great book if you're insterested in mythology. Although it could've been more complete, since it gives little information about each goddess, the fact that there are goddesses from so many cultures really makes up for it.The best has to be the artwork by Rebecca Guay. Sometimes you can't imagine how the goddess is from the lifeless description, but Rebecca makes up for it. Her drawings are excellent and very detailed. I wish there was one for each goddess but, you can't have it all! :)"
5,Very well laid out.,"The book was not what I was expecting. At first glance, while looking at the cover and flipping through the pages, it looks like a children's book. I was going to return the book, then thought better of it since I have two children that I could teach them about the goddesses from this book. They both showed an interest in the book because of the vibrants colors that were on the outside/in.A couple of days after receiving the book, I started to read the information inside and found that the book does give some valuable beginner details. I find that I will learn enough beginner information to spark an interest in learning more. Plus, I will have a reference books to read to my two children as I am learning."
5,Beautiful Introduction to Goddess Lore,Truely lovely illustrations accompany the entries in this book to make it a great introduction to a wide variety of goddesses from all across the world.
3,"Interesting stories, Fiato's credibility questionable","Fiato has many interesting stories, but most relate to his dealings with low-level ""wanna-bes"". His encounters with ""made guys"" are mentioned, but little detail is given. This leads me to believe he had very few meaningful encounters/business dealings with these guys. His claim that he was being groomed to become a ""boss"" in LA is absurd considering he was never even formally inducted into LCN. The worst part of the book is when Fiato claims his brother was responsible for him turning ""rat"" - its as if he feels that by using his brother as a scapegoat, he can reclaim any respect he once had. It is clear to the reader, however, that Fiato cooperated to save his own skin, period. The book is a fun read, but I came away thinking there was a little fiction tossed in to make Fiato appear more important than he was."
3,"TOO MUCH NAME DROPPING,NOT ENOUGH SUBSTANCE.","I LIKE MOB STORIES.IN PARTICULAR,ANYTHING THAT INVOLVES THE MOB IN LOS ANGELES.THIS ONE WASNT THE WORST I HAVE READ,BUT IT WAS FAR FROM THE BEST.ALTHOUGH FIATO GAVE A GOOD INSIGHT TO STREET LEVEL MOB ACTIVITIES,TO ME HE SPENDS MORE TIME NAME DROPPING EVERY STAR HE HAPPENED TO BRUSH UP AGAINST.HE COULDNT HAVE BEEN REAL SMART IF HE WAS TALKING OPENLY ON HIS HOME PHONE.ANY WISE GUY WITH HALF A BRAIN KNOWS YOU DONT SAY ANYTHING ON YOUR OWN PHONE,WHICH IS WHAT EVENTUALLY DID HIM IN.THE AUTHOR DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB,DESPITE THE LACK OF SUBSTANCE IN MANY OF THE STORIES.I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST FIATO,I JUST GOT THE FEELING HE WASNT BEING TOTALLY TRUTHFULL.HUEVOS YES,BUT BRAINS?GOOD LUCK ON THE RUN ANTHONY."
2,AVERAGE AT BEST,THIS BOOK IS NOT WHAT I HAD HOPED IT TO BE. THERE ARE MANY MORE INTERESTING MAFIA BOOKS OUT THERE LIKE JIMMY FRATTIANOS BOOK OR THE JOE DOGS BOOK. THIS BOOK HAS NO CONTINUITY AND RAMBLES ON AND ON. VERY AVERAGE.
1,What a phony,Don't waste your money on this fiction. Most of the stories in the book are bogus. Fiato is making himself out to be something he never was - enforcer? Pullleeeze! Fiato couldn't beat up his own mother. Ask any outfit guy - Fiato is a Hollywood fabrication.Feed the rat some government cheese!
4,hardcore enforcer,"the mob in LA was weak EXCEPT FOR Fiato what a life this guy had, money, broads, Armani, Porshe Beverly hills he was walking around in front of all the mob toughs in LA, WITH DENISE BROWN, even AFTER he ratted most of them out. That proves he was fearless. Mafia enforcer Fiato, and Puggy Z, a mob groupie, made lots of money in loansharking"
4,real mob life,Iliked the book.I heard the animal on the radio he was spectacular.he should have been the author I have never heard the mafia articulated in such great depth.
2,A fairy tale,"The book is supposily a true story, but I can tell you that several things in the book are basically Fiato's imagination or twisted reality of what really happened, He shows what kind of low-life he really is, more worried about everyone knowing he is sleeping with Nichole Simpson sister, which in truth is probibly the highlight of a lowlifes world.It is entertaining though because it seemed so new to me like I wasn't even there,but after reading it and comparing the realalities to the fantasy I could tell they just mislabeled it."
5,This is the most authentic view into the life of the mob,"This is the most authentic, and exciting view of organized crime I have ever read. Not only is it full of the true life day to day events of one of the most feared Mob emforcers, but it also shows the true unseen sides of the glamour of Los Angeles. Anthony Fiato took control of the West Coast Mob with sheer viciousness, and chilling brut force within the glitz of Hollywood, Rodeo Drive, and the surrounding areas. I never thought this could happen in beautiful California. This book is like no other Mob book I have seen or read. If you want the real deal on the life in the Mob, and if you read one book this year, make it this one. you will not be sorry. The Animal in Hollywood is truely a compelling, and exciting book."
5,diamond in the rough,real and not misleading anthony fiato is a tough guy with brains he was the mob boss in Hollywood in early eighties
4,the real deal,I haved lived in LA all my life and was well aware of Anthony Fiato and Mike Rizzitello by reputation this book realy tells it like they are. this book even understates Rizzitello and Fiato
2,Reads like a newpaper account,"I love mob books. Can't get enough of them. This book had some intersting parts to it, but it didn't read like a real storey, such as, 'The Company She Keeps' or 'Underboss'. Those books kept me on the edge. This book was more like facts being stated. It didn't keep me wanting to turn the pages to find out what happened. I like a book that gives me information and entertains me at the same time. The Animal in Hollywood didn't do it for me."
2,A Rat is a Rat,"Fiato is like most informants they always find ways to rationalize their treachery. There is a saying on the street "" If you cant do the time dont do the crime"" Fiato and people like him enjoy the life until it comes time to pay, then they turn on people that trusted them. Fiato is just one of many Rats that turned and will continue to turn when faced with paying the price of their actions."
4,tough guy,TONY COMES ACROSS AS A REAL DEAL TOUGH GUY.HOLLYWOOD BACKGROUND MAKES THE MOB EVEN TOUGHER. THE BOOK IS AN EASY READ.THE LIFE THIS GUY HAS LEAD IS FANTASTIC.
4,It was a very insightful book,"I thought it was very good and it got even to the heart of Anthony Fiato, someone known as the Animal of Hollywood. Very good book."
4,Great quality for the price,"I bought this ram quite awhile ago, but remember only receiving one when I had ordered two. I contacted the company and even though people are dishonest and I could have been about receiving only one, they sent me the second one, no questions asked. The company has great integrity and the one RAM was shipped almost immediately and I received it very quickly. The second one also came very quickly and I am overall very pleased with my experience."
4,SDRAM,This was decent RAM. Nothing special. It did what it was supposed to do. I bought it as a Christmas present for a friend and he hasn't had any problems with it.
2,You could do worse.,"This book promotes a fad diet.There's nothing wrong with choosing to eat the way the book suggests if you want to.Lots of veggies and even the occasional raw fish are a helluvu lot better than much of the excrement people shovel down their craws these days.My objection is to the false claim that this method of eating is based on ""science.""This method of eating is based on a fanciful idea that the author had and adapted into a spiritual philosophy.If that nutter Morgan Spurlock can eat only McD for a month, then surly you'll come out alright following this plan for as long as you can stand it.Just don't allow yourself to be boondoggled into believing there's anything intrinsically ""genetic"" ""wise"" or ""fit"" about this nutrition plan.The keys to health have always been moderation and exercise."
3,Pan Flute is one of my favorites!,I like the pan flute very much and Zamfir is my favorite. I am pleased with this purchase and recommend it to others.
4,"Useful, possibly revelatory","This book validated anger for me and made me realize how much I suppress it in order to be 'good'. The message of this book is there is nothing good about such suppression. As the author says, he could have titled it 'The Love Book', and in reading it you'll understand why.Warning: the edition I read ('74 or so) could have benefited big-time from a skilled editor. Maybe the latest is improved?"
2,Fundamentally a meaningful book but far too redundant.,"Since I tend to be a person one would describe as hot-headed or ill-tempered, I thought this the perfect gift. Honestly, I believe that much of what Dr. Rubin purports to be true: that many psychological problems stem from our inability to connect to our anger.However, I found that the book's main points are made in the first several chapters while the balance is spent reiterating those points continually. In my opinion, Dr. Rubin should've spent more time helping the reader with excercises aimed at connecting WITH the anger rather than understanding its many faces.Maybe he is setting us up for ""The Angry Book II"". I think I will pass -- I'm a bit angry that I got this book as a gift."
1,"Not for Recovery: acting in anger, any anger, is deadly","Despite it's being billed by some as a book for those in 12-Step recovery from addiction, this book is in opposition to a basic tenet of 12-Step practice. Anger is deadly. We must avoid anger at all times. While we may at times find ourselves in moments of anger, we must learn ways to have it immediately removed.""If we were to live, we had to be free of anger. The grouch and the brainstorm were not for us. They may be the dubious luxury of normal men, but for alcoholics these things are poison."" (Reprinted from Alcoholics Anonymous AKA The Big Book, page 66, with permission of A.A. World Services, Inc.)In my limited experience, those who refrain from acting in anger are happiest and most productive."
5,An Eye-Opener,"I've brought this little book from a library sale some years ago, and it was just sitting in some boxes until I brought it out at a friend's recommendation.So, I finally got to read ""The Angry Book,"" which is really an eye-opener and it has given me powerful glimpses and it has helped me with putting things from my past in a proper context. I have been writing these things as being applied to me in my journals and I felt grown from a firm awareness of my anger. I just cannot recommend this book enough."
4,I can think of plenty of reasons not to like this book...,"There's too much profanity, too much smoking, too much sassy/stubborn/hotheadedness, a plot that stretched my suspension-of-disbelief almost to the limit, too much inside-the-trade information for a non-antiques person, etc, etc, etcBut, when all is said and done, it comes down to this - do the characters still live for me after the final page? They do - Molly, Randall, Bitsy, and especially Daria. Here's hoping she doesn't get killed off in the next book.Yeah, I'll be reading the next one...."
4,You Don't Have To Love Antiques!,"The other reviews say about as much as can be said for this book except one thing. It does start pretty slow. Being the first book in a series, the reader should expect the obligatory background information. I just felt that maybe Flinn spent a little too much time on it, even for the first book. But stick with it because in the end, it is worth it. I hesitate to give it five stars because I think this series is only going to get better.Usually, I find myself getting lost in antique mysteries but not in this case. Flinn wrote the story in a way as to not lose the reader who is not an antique-buff. It's wonderful for those who love art and antiques but it's not exclusive to them. Well worth the read and the slow beginning. I can't wait for the next installment."
2,Extremely disappointing,"Although well-written in terms of style, this book has both a weak plot and weak characters. Throughout the book, antiques dealer Molly Doyle and the police chief interact in a variety of unrealistic ways, and Doyle throughout displays few of the intellectual characteristics a real high-powered business woman would need for success. The plot is creaky and obvious and, again, the suspects act as two-dimensional figures. Argh!"
4,Great Series,"I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did, because I didn't see how the antique business would hold my attention. I was pleasantly surprised.The characters were fairly realistic and likeable and the writing style was good. As a smoker, though, even I was a bit surprised at how much emphasis was put on the characters and their smoking. It was nice for a change not to read the typical anti-smoking BS, but the author should've toned it down a bit because it started to overpower the story.The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was that I found a lot of errors -- spelling, grammar and consistency (several times, characters were referred to by the wrong name). Otherwise, I look forward to reading the next installment."
1,Returned,"I will never again purchase shoes via the internet. The shoes may have been fine, but the size was unusually narrow. I'm guessing it's a function of them being unisex. Anyway, they were returned and I bought the same brand (different style) from a local brick and mortar store. Lesson learned."
5,Great Buy,"I bought these shoes as a present to my boyfriend who works in a casual bank. He totally loved them and said that they are very comfortable, and, I must say, quite fashionable"
2,"Be Prepared for a Length ""Breaking-In"" Period","To echo the reviews of others, I have found these Docs to be quite different from others I have owned. They are now made in China instead of England. Also, the leather is VERY stiff and shoe does not feel that comfortable. I have owned them for a few months and they have started to break in a bit, but normally, Docs shouldn't take that long.I bought the gaucho (brown) Docs on Amazon and they are the ones I am still ""working on."" However, I purchased a black pair (same style) from a local shoe store and they are quite comfortable (even though they are also made in China). So this shoe's woes may be due to the particular supplier/retailer for Amazon."
2,Sizing has changed,"I have bought Dr Martens in the past because I never had to worry about width -- wide was their thing! As far as I know you can't buy half-sizes in Dr Martens for this reason. These shoes are the same size as previous models I have bought, but after two weeks of 'wearing them in' I'm reluctantly realising that my little toes are never going to be happy in them. This is a tough hard shoe to break in, which is often true of a good quality shoe; but the lack of width makes that a disadvantage to broader-footed people like me!"
2,Unsatisfied with the new pair,I bought this pair of shoes because my other ones just like it are starting to show marks after 4 years of daily wear. My new ones are not as comfortable as my old ones. [...] Every day that I wear my new pair I have a line across the top of my foot where the (very slightly) padded part of the tongue meets the unpadded part of the tongue. [...]
2,Can't believe Dr. Marten's are made in China now,The soles of these shoes are very comfortable but the padded collar of the shoes need to be broken in very well.
5,I've had this pair for 3 years!!!,An I'm still wearing them. I went through 4 laces and it's still going strong... It is soo comfortable and a great work/casual shoe. Highly recommended!!!
2,Not the same quality anymore,"I have owned docs since the 90's. I got married in a pair of wingtip docs 13 years ago, but sadly I will never own another pair. The padded collar is made of some cheap thin vinyl and has shredded apart and these are the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever owned. The sole has held up well, but the rest is just one big disappointment after owning the real thing that was made in England."
3,looks good but might want to upsize,"I like the looks of the shoes but the fit is a bit tight, I'm trying to break them in at this point. May want to consider a 1/2 size larger"
3,Pretty Good,Most of the book is really good but close to the end I just get pissed off that a woman could be so stupid!
2,Not Katie's best,"I'v eread several other Katie MacAlister novels and had high expectations. I was, however, quite disappointed in this book. Where to begin? Perhaps the heroine: annoying, unfocused, frenzied without being funny. The hero: Well, gee, I never really understood him. What motivated him? What possible interest could he have in Alex, as annoying as she was? How in the world did they fall in love? Too fast, too frenzied, not enough of the basics. This book bugged me so much, in fact, that I almost dropped the author from my list of must-buys. I can heartily recommend several other of Katie's books, though: Sex and the Single Vampire, Hard Day's Knight, Noble Intentions."
1,"Unspeakably bad. SO bad. bad, bad, arrgh","I give this book one star only because zero wouldn't show up. It is probably the most sickening excuse for reading material outside of -- gee, I'm at a loss. Only sheer bloody-minded perseverance let me finish the thing. I even had to turn frequently to the letters of Pliny the Younger to stop my brains dripping out my ears in protest at having to absorb this garbage. While the 'heroine'--a self-centered, whiney and vulgar woman of the emotional age of 13 for whom we are presumably to feel some sort of empathy or sympathy-- writes a trashy novel, so bad as to be an object of derision, so too does this one mimic it. Oh, even the memory of this drivel nauseates me. Such a far cry from the dragon series as to suggest that MacAlister allowed ten chimps access to a typewriter and enough sugar-spiked bananas to make the notion of anyone spending money to buy this thing funnier still than the proverbial banana peel slip. Oh, gods. This was so bad."
2,Below Average,"I really wanted to like this book - the title is fun, the cover is fun, the premise is fun, and Macalister's most recent book, Men in Kilts, was awesome. But.. this was not a quality book. The main character (Alix) is an annoying female that is just as self-centered and obnoxious as her friends say she is. The lead male (Alex) is just not believable. In fact, the entire romance lacks realism and is hardly more than teen fluff. I felt like this book was very immature and seemed geared to a very low age group - like teens. It just wasn't well written and I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Not up to snuff,"I LOVE Katie MacAlister's books, but I have to say I was very disappointed with this one. The heroine was not at all likeable, I'm sorry to say. You never get why the romantic characters (Alex and Alix) like each other, and they don't seem to have anything in common besides sex. I can't see why they would stay together. As I said I really love Katie's books, usually, but this one was not as developed as her other works. Try reading hard days knight, or one of the Aisling Grey novels, to get an idea of how good Katie really is."
1,how the !!#@!#$%%^$^$! did this get 4 stars,"This book was so bad I actually threw it away at the half way mark. I kept waiting for some revelation that the heroine was just joking and not such a bitch. No such luck. And the thing that pissed me off the most is that the hero is a decent guy for the most part. At least in the Vampire series the guys are just as dim witted and immature as the girl. But to try and justify a decent guy throwing himself away on a heroine that selfish. Geeeeeeeeeeeez! If I wanted to deal with that, I'd go outside my house and watch real life unfold. There are plenty of good people throwing themselves away on horrible relationships (hence the whole reason of reading, to escape reality).No one should buy this book. I was so insulted and angry I had to try and do something relaxing to calm down. Total trash. How could this author waste hours writing about such a horrible woman! Is she that immature?"
4,Worth the wait,I loved all the book except the heroine. She drove me batty. She wouldn't stop and listen till finally she did and then it was like a butterfly coming out of its cocoon. I loved the book and will happily read it again. I loved the growth she went through and how she stood on her own to do it. It's a good read that you will enjoy.
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!!!,"Okies...what a gem!! I laughed so hard think I hurt myself! I simply loved Alix and Alex. Loved Alix's attempt at writing, can related to her insecurities and the needs to pick out a stupid excuse to distance yourself in order to keep from getting hurt. I loved the odd ball tenants in the flats that surround them.Sheesh...I just loved this book...what more can I say!!Thank you, Miss MacAlister. I am eagerly awaiting you other books!!"
1,One of Katie's worst...,"As a fan of Katie's I was very disappointed in this novel.Alix was a TSTL heroine; Whiny, Tantrum-Throwing, Self-Centered, Useless Female.I enjoyed Alex as a hero, but I couldn't understand what he saw in her (besides the sex.)I had to grit my teeth to finish the book and will be very happy to trade this one in."
1,Most obnoxious main character ever!!!,"What a huge disappointment this book was. The main character was so annoying I was hoping she would just disappear by the the third chapter. The love story had no chemistry and I began to get annoyed with the male Alex for putting up with all the whining, complaining, and generally stupid things the female Alix did. I've read alot of great books lately but this is not one of them. ..."
2,BAD English,"Other than a few mildly humorous comments by the main character, I was extremely disappointed in this book. The main character was so unlikable that it just made the book unenjoyable."
2,What a disappointing hero!,"Many people have complained about the heroine in this story, but I have issues with the hero. What a boring, judgmental, stick in the mud! I do not see what Alix saw in him. He was the major problem in this book for me. I enjoyed the first half, even laughing out loud, but eventually my dislike of the hero took away any enjoyment I had in the book."
3,"Improper American, maybe","I was initially draw to this book because it is about an American woman and an English guy (I am a sucker for the English accent). While I find the book in places to be amusing, I thought the leading female character, Alix, was just too much. She was so outlandish in her actions at times that I was wanting to say, ""Girl, get some sense into you."" The last few chapters were somewhat redeeming for the book because at least she made some improvements to herself.All in all the book was not that bad. It is just the initial actions of Alix that made me want to put the book down a few times."
3,Nutty Needy Female meets a Prince of Men,`Improper English' by Katie Macalister is a humorous dysfunctional romance novel. The main character is Alexandra who is from Settle and living in England for the summer writing a historical romance novel. She meets Alexander who works for Scotland Yard in the porn department. Their relationship has spark and lot of humor but sometimes you just want strangle Alexandra for being so needy. If you are looking for funny and dysfunctional this will be your perfect pick. If this is your first Katie Macalister I would check out her later work such as 'Hard Day's Knight' instead (it was better).
2,Too Annoying,"I love Katie MacAlister but the main character, Alix was everything everyone said she was. Too annoying, too klutzy, too self centered. There were random moments when I wanted to just smack her. We get our HEA but the author makes us work for it by making Alix so utterly annoying that you're not even cheering for her!"
1,Awful,"This book was just awful, and a waste of money. I had to grit my teeth and force myself to finish the book. The heroine, Alix, was a self-centered, childish, immature, whinny, ill-mannered, selfish character. It was truly horrible to read, and I would NEVER recommend this to anyone. I sold it as soon as I was finished, I couldn't even stand to have it in my house anymore.Truly awful book. save your money, and buy something with depth and character, not this horrendous book."
5,Nice,These airports are well done and visually pleasing. Like to fly in German country a great deal. Get it now.
3,High Time We Went,"Having been a long time fan of Cocker without actually buying any of his stuff, I never realized what a bipolar artist he is. There's some rough stuff here, some soulful Blues, some vaguely Psychedelic tunes, and some truly awful light Pop.For me, the Mad Dogs & Englishmen stuff and Woodstock-era live stuff is Cocker's best. Heavily influenced by Ray Charles and other American soul acts of the 1950s and 60's, Cocker could growl with the best of them and knew how to wrestle a melody to his own uses.I would have been willing to pay the same price for a single CD if it would have meant the exclusion of a couple of disco-ish tunes and that train wreck of a song from ""Officer and A Gentleman."""
5,"This, And THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION, Are The Essential Cocker","ANTHOLOGY, JOE COCKER!, WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS, MAD DOGS & ENGLISHMEN, THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION, SOMETHING TO SAY, I CAN STAND A LITTLE RAIN, and RESPECT YOURSELF, taken together, are the essential Joe Cocker. While the first three albums are nothing short of essential, You should get both anthologies and the later records I've mentioned as well because contrary to what some fans and critics will tell you, the later years have not been wasted entirely, and Cocker has also grown into a richer, deeper vocalist as he has aged. If you get all of the albums I've mentioned, you will not, in spite of what some revisionists might say, be cluttering up your living space. Instead, you will be hearing how a great voice has grown and developed through the years."
1,False advertisement,"Product (3.5 inch Floppy Disks) were ""High Density"" disks instead of being Double Density disks like they were advertised. Can't use them because they were not what I ordered. I am an unhappy camper and will never use Amazon for anything again. Dan AllisonFujifilm 3.5in. Double Density Floppy Disk - IBM Formatted (25-Pack, Assorted Colors)"
1,Sorry,I am a huge Duke Robillard fan. I waited and waited for this album when I found out it was coming out. I bought it the day it came out and was totally disappointed. I know Duke is known for his wide range of styles but nothing on this disc did anything for me. Keep in mind this is my opinion but I have alot of what he has recorded solo and as guest appearances. Pick up Dukes Blues if you are a first timer. If you aren't....post your comments on this site.
1,I have to agree,"Wow, I have to agree...this isn't Duke's best by any stretch of the imagination. A few of the cuts are pretty decent but too much time is spent with songs that are just plain odd. We love Duke for his guitar stylings, not this kind of thing. Actually, the new Robert Charels CD ""Metropolitan Blue"" that Robilard produced or the work he did with Herb Ellis is much closer to a classic Duke or Roomful album than this is. I bet Duke bounces back strong though because he truly is one of the greats."
4,3 and a half stars actully........ cool monster battles.....,"Well, the story kinda sucked, the andriod effects (when he was running) where very, very ""hokey"".The fights where cool........ i would reccomend it 100% but it takes place after Godzilla VS. Biolantei and helps explain why in the ones after this one he is like 600 feet tall becasue originally he was like 300 feet tall...... in other words..... it's ""O.K.""!"
4,This One's The Up For Heisi!,"This is my second favorite Heisi G-Film. From the deep and distant future, three people(two men and one girl), come to warn us about warn us about Godzilla's radiation. It will polute the waters around the world and cause panic. People then go back and erase him from ever living! Or did they? This has one of the greatest plots in Kaiju history. I like the new King Ghidorah origen as well as how they made Godzilla turn ten times as powerful as the '85' with one explosion from a nucular sub. The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because the actors didn't put feeling into their character exept 2 of them."
3,Barely Hidden Agenda,"Although this is a fairly entertaining movie, Godzilla Vs. King Ghidorah is the most nationalistic, imperialist, racist Godzilla movie I have seen In the future, Japan is the most powerful country in the world, occupying much of Asia and South America. The scenes from World War II are unapologetic, and the Americans are portrayed as the aggressors. In addition to this, the Caucasian soldiers are incompetent; they all charge right under the feet of the proto-Godzilla and are killed to the last man. The Japanese, knowing better, don't antagonize the beast, and get away unharmed. The special effects and action scenes of this film are decent for a Godzilla movie of the time. The story is lacking: the overly ambitious time-travel plot leaves many holes to be filled. This is a fun movie to watch, but bear in mind that it is politically subversive, overtly so."
4,G vs. KG revisited.,"In my previous review, I made a mistake. The line ""Suitmation actor Ken Satsuma continues to perfect his portrayal of a more animalistic Godzilla."" is a little too similar to a line in David Kalat's excellent tome, A CRITICAL HISTORY AND FILMOGRAPHY OF TOHO'S GODZILLA SERIES. I did not realize the error until I re-read the book just recently. My apologies to Mr. Kalat and to anyone who noticed the error.That said, G vs KG is a fun movie. Sure, it does have some holes(the time travel aspect of the script is particularly troublesome) and the American ""actors"" are all pretty much in the school play league. But, the spfx are generally excellent, the score is magnificent, and the cast is very good."
3,MEGA King Gidorah!!!!,This movie was alright I really dig the godzilla suit.The onlything I didnt like was the time travel thing.I mean it was cooland all but it didn't make sense if you watching and thinkingthe whole idea carefully.That android actor was not so hot and i notice they had the veteran it self in this G flick.King Gidorahwas very cool especilly Mega King Gidorah when he and Godzilla was fighting but overal this is one the far better godzilla movies I watch
3,Recommended for true G-Fans only...,"King Ghidorah is by far the coolest of G's foes. Besides seeing a revamped Ghidorah, we also get to see Mecha King Ghidorah. You'll also see some very nice special effects along with a great soundtrack. Now for the weak points... Godzillasaurous (pre-mutated Godzilla) is extremely lame. It attacks some army guys who yell and scream a lot. The whole sequence with Godzillasaurous is pretty pathetic. Then you have your ""spacemen"". These modern aliens tend to say the cheesiest lines. One of these aliens turns into a good guy. This new good alien can run super-fast and has a really lame jetpack and ""space gun"". Luckily, these aliens have a pretty cool death scene! Well, that's the good and the bad. A definite buy for the true G-Fan, but newbies and casual viewers should check out the original Godzilla Vs. Monster Zero before they buy this one."
3,Cool-Looking Mecha-Ghidorah!,"Okay...here's one conservative review. The dialogue and acting in this film is as lame as one would expect from a Godzilla flick. But I don't watch these for great intellectual stimulation. Godzilla gets mad...stuff gets blown up...buildings are smashed...and there are cheesy special effects galore! What more could a G-Fan want? My only complaint with this episode is that out of the 106 minutes running time, there's only about 30 minutes of good mayhem. The rest of the time is wasted on goofy humans. I do think that the pyrotechnics and special FX are improved in these 90's versions of the series. And the Mecha-Ghidorah at the end is worth the price of the video. Pretty fun stuff."
3,One of Benjamin's Favorites,"How much sense does a film have to make when you're only 4 years old? Apparently not much. This film has spaceships, giant monsters, army guys, explosions, heck everything a four year old needs. He walks around in slow motion doing a very convincing soprano Godzilla, complete with the echo trailing off at the end. I hold him up by the belly and he flies around the room, each arm a head, and he sprays lightning all around the room. This is especially fun at daycare where no one has a clue what we are doing, just that we are having fun. The plot is ridiculous and perhaps a bit racist, but really -- how much difference is there between these movies and pro-wrestling anyway?"
2,Japan Is so Insecure about losing a war it started.,"This is so stuped of a script you've got to see it to beleive it. To use Godzilla to make Japan look better in WWII in this or any way is sad. They depict the west (America) as a crul economic aggresor trying to crush poor little Japan using Ghidora and of course the west (America) has to go back in time to do this. After all Japan has economic control of Brazil, the hole of Africa and some other places in the future. It sounds like the Axis only has one member left! The only good thing in this movie is the fight senes. Also Godzilla is in it."
4,Pretty good,"I actually think this movie deserves 3.5 stars, but oh well. One good thing about this movie is that we get to see what Godzilla looked like before coming Godzilla! It's SO cool!"
3,"Go, GODZILLA!!!","This movie is one of the best Heisei movies made. King Ghidorah's in it, Godzilla looks great, and there's Godzilla as a dinosaur! However, the flaws are not really in the movie itself, but it is recorded in EP format, making for some tracking control. And the dubbing is quite awful. But, there are cool explosions and maser tanks and King Ghidorah, so this movie is a must own for any Godzilla fan!"
2,not as good,At one time had the original They Called it Purple Heart Valley. The pictures were clear and it was a great book. This copy is a really cheap copy at a very high price. Do not waste your money.
5,Nice piece of jewelry,"I purchased 1 of the vitrail pendants several months ago. It was so pretty it glitters and changes color when it catches the light. I then ordered a second one and attached them to silver earring hooks, they make beautiful dangling earrings. Unfortunately I lost one and because I liked it so much I ordered another one. I also purchased 2 of the vitrail light pendants but the darker vitrail is richer in color. Very pleased with this item you will love it."
2,Chips Easily,"I have several genuine swarovski crystals that were expensive in comparison to the one I am reviewing . My daughter purchased one in Austria and I wore it everyday for about 2 years. I have several others that I purchased at mall kiosks and all have held up well. Although the crystal I am reviewing is beautiful, I have only had it for a few weeks and have noticed that it already has several chips. One side of the crystal actually has a noticeable gouge out of it. I can't explain how this has happened since I have not been scaling walls or rolling in sandpits recently (joke). All I can say is that the other crystal, several years older, that I have been wearing at the same time, is fine. It's not a huge loss, since the crystal was quite cheap. I guess ""you get what you pay for"" applies in this case."
4,Mud Flaps,"I was looking for the specfic GMC form to the fender, So when it arrived We were preparing for the holidays and when I got around to opening it, was not exactly what I wanted but I will give them to some one else."
5,Good Insights!,"Laura begins by telling readers that the single most horrible problem for marriages today is the lack of understanding of what a man needs in a woman, and vice-versa.""Chivalry is largely dead, and feminism is the murderer!"" Laura sees ""equality"" as potential major pitfall - the two parties are not the same, and should not be expected to provide the same assets.Most of ""The Proper Care and Feeding of Marriage"" is taken up with asking males and females (separately) basic questions such as what they most value in a mate, what most bothers them, their biggest surprises in marriage, etc. She concludes by cautioning that divorce is usually not a good path out of an unhappy marriage.Useful and interesting."
4,Engaging and I want to read more from Dr. Laura,"I think this book is easy to read and quite engaging as Dr. Laura writes by using examples of her radio show callers in the form of narration and actual conversations. Admittedly, I was put off in the beginning where she emphasizes on how feminism plays a part in the conflicts of a marriage, but after she explains the core roles of man vs. woman in a marriage, I am quickly able to understand the rest of the book via the simplified perspective. I learned quite a lot from reading this book and I've just ordered two other books by Dr. Laura because I find the examples easily understandable, and I want to read more."
5,"Great book, Will save your marriage",Wow. I love this book. I think all married people need to read this book. It is a real slap in the face and make you think about what you could be doing to distroy your marriage. THis might be a great engagement or wedding shower gifts. Things that all married people need to have on hand. My husband and I have both read it and are getting better at communicating with each other and I am leaving my feminist ways behind. I am learning on how to be a real woman. Good luck to all that read this book.
5,A Must Read,"In The whole ""God made a mistake by giving men and women different characteristics world"", this book brings logic and reason back into marriage and relationships. Men and Women are equal, but DIFFERENT. Physically, Mentally and Emotionally. Dr. Laura shows how to embrace these differences and allow them to compliment each other to bring about a healthy marriage."
2,average,She has really good intentions but there were parts of the book that I found to be old fashioned thinking. That just doesn't fit into my life right now. There are some good concepts and I like the Christian tie-in but I have a problem with giving your all to your spouse and HOPING to get it in return when in reality it doesn't come. I didn't finish the book because that issue wasn't addressed early on.
5,Great Service!,Haven't read the book (bought it for a friend) but the book was in excellent condition and was very speedy service.
2,The Abridged version sucks,All it is a really long rambling of what men & women like and dislike about each other and it's really boring. I think I'll buy the book instead!
3,Bought it for my husband for his Birthday,"Not sure if he has read it, but there have been improvements in our marriage. He did at least read some of it!"
2,Not too sure....,"I'm not in 100% agreement with her views on certain things but she has good points. I don't think I would recommend this to people, but it doesn't hurt to read it. If this book helps the reader, that's all that matters."
5,A MUST READ!!!,"EVERYONE should read this book! Ladies, it's a great follow-up to The Proper Care & Feeding of Husbands. It has saved my marriage and changed my attitude!"
3,Some Good Nagging,"This was what you would expect from Dr. Laura - who I actually enjoy quite a bit. The nagging got to me (as it does on her radio show), but sometimes that nagging is just what you need to really kick you out of your comfort zone. I think we all get a little complacent in our relationships, especially with kids, work, volunteer obligations - in short, life. I liked the last half of the book more than the first - more solid examples of what you can do to make your marriage (even) better. Recommended."
4,Great book but it takes 2 for it to work....,"Great book but it will only work if both parties buy into it. If only one side buys into it and the other party is oblivious, then the side that's trying so hard may feel slighted."
2,VERY condescending - poorly written,"I don't know who edited this book but they did a poor job. While reading it, I kept thinking that my 7th Grade English teacher would NOT approve of that sentence!It doesn't help any that Dr. Laura is a bully and can be a b**** on the radio. I just find no value in brow-beating people on national radio just to make yourself look intelligent or knowledgeable.Personally, I don't think Dr. Laura has any moral authority to speak on this subject and she obviously does not have the writing abiltiy either."
5,"Actual readers, please advise.","I read Doctor Laura's last book, and true to form, it rings true. Would those of you who actually read this new book please let us know if the material is fresh enough to justify reading the new one? Or is it basically redundant?Thank you much."
1,"Dr. Laura Wants You Back in the Kitchen, Ladies!","While there are a few nuggets of ordinary wisdom in this work, mostly it's a Jeremiad against feminism and a call to a return to ""Leave It to Beaver"" America, with Daddy sallying forth each day in quest of the bacon, and Mommy at the door, slippers in one hand and martini in the other, when he gets home.Sure, it makes sense to treasure your partner, and let her or him know it, but Schlessinger's message of ""recovery"" from feminism is facile nostalgia.Her support for her arguments? The ""feedback"" she gets from her radio listeners, who are hardly likely to be applying a critical ear or eye to her views.Marriage indeed needs care and feeding, but we need not go back to antiquated gender stereotypes for guidance."
1,What a bunch of nonsense!,"Please save your money and do not buy this drivel. Most of this book is a direct and harsh attack on feminists, and feminism in general. Guess what, Dr. Laura? It's 2007, not 1957. She has no practical or specific suggestions for improving a marriage, just general ""smile and be pretty, open your legs and don't complain""."
2,No means No,"This women is an idiot. She believes that you should say yes to your partner every time they want sex. Outside of marriage, no means no, but according to her, inside of marriage you should always do what your mate wants. Just because there is a piece of paper involved doesn't mean you give up your right to say no."
2,Decent advise,"Decent book for those husbands who do nothing to help thier wives. Otherwise, save your money and the whole jist of the book can be summed up as follows: it's the small and simple things that keeps a marriage going."
2,Audiobook is NOT read by the author :-(,"Although the content is very valuable..., the audiobook would have been MUCH more effective and better if it were read by Dr. Laura herself."
5,Dr Laura,Dr Laura gives down to earth excellent recommendations. It is just that most of us are too selfish to follow them. The recommendations are simple common sense solutions to marriage problems that we in our selfishness try to make into difficult solutions. Instead of thinking of our children's welfare we are only concerned with our own. We have our priorities in the wrong place. We need to grow up and become responsible adults.
2,jennerclay,"I think everyone reading this book should factor intothe equation that Laura believes (and has pontificatedmany times on this issue on her radio show) that it's""ok"" for men to rape women --IF-- the woman allows thethe man to ""make out"" with her for a ""certain"" lengthof time. In other words, she DOES NOT respect a woman'sright to say ""NO!!!!!!"" To put it another way, if a womanis thinking she might want to get lusty with a man, andthen starts making out with the man, Laura believes thatthe woman has given-up her right to change her mind andsay NO! NO! NO! She explains that men have NO controlover their sexual urges and that if the woman ""leadsthe man on"" with foreplay, then she gives up all herrights to change her mind, because THE MAN IS AKINTO A WILD ANIMAL AND HE CAN'T EVER, EVER, EVER S-T-0-Phimself once he gets ""turned-on!""This is a huge insult to men and a condemnation of a woman'sautonomy/freedom. So, be sure to remember that as you'rereading through this book."
1,yuck,yuck is all I have to say about Dr. Laura...She works outside the home but does not seem to think other women should...what's with that?
4,Silicone Ice Trays,They do work. A whole lot easier getting the ice out than the conventional ice cube trays. We use them daily.
5,Another book told with heart and caring by Pilcher.,No doubt one of he best novels R. Pilcher has written. The story of unlikely people coming together in a short period of time. Good read. Cried and laughed. Nothing about Pilcher is exaggerated or fake. She gets to the heart of a subject and gives all the angels and insights of the characters. I find her writing deep and daring. Loved this book and enjoyed it tremendously.
5,"Cozy, Closed-in & Comfortable","Light a fire in the wood stove, grab a shawl, put on the kettle and settle down next to a window. Pilcher's books are best enjoyed while sipping tea and occasionally glancing outside at the fog (if you don't have fog, use your imagination). This is my favorite of Pilcher's novels if only for its comforting quality. The characters are able to resolve their dilemmas without over-the-top drama - a welcome break from the nonstop action and larger-than-life characters found in most pop fiction. Excellent evocation of life in modern London and rural Scotland."
5,Heart Warming,"I love Pilcher's use of imagery, her beautiful details, and the soft way the story is told. A beautiful escape from the mundane, perfect for reading by the fire during a chilly evening with a cup of tea!"
5,Such a good story!,"This is without a doubt one of the best books to ""go away"" in I've ever read - Rosamunde Pilcher is delightful!I had already read the book, but wanted a nice hardback to go on my bookshelves - when I saw it had to dig out the paperback to re-read it - such a good read!"
5,Incredible!,I could not put this book down! The author has an incredible gift of making it feel like you were living right in the Estate! I loved this book! It also showed me not to be upset when winter arrives with the cold and snow..but to embrace it!
5,Great book,"Reading Rosamunde Pilcher is like being given a big cozy hug. Her books are like old friends I can read again and again. Winter Solstice is no exception. I really enjoyed this book. The story and the characters were easy to like and become interested in.I only have one complaint...and not with the author...it is that the Kindle edition of this book has an appalling amount of typos in it! I don't mean just one or two, I mean, regularly, through the whole book. Words are misspelled or completely incorrect, punctuation is missing, odd symbols are put in places they are not required. Who let this book get out like that?! What a mess!"
5,LOVED IT,I BOUGHT THIS FOR AN OLDER FRIEND. SHE HAS LISTENED TO IT SO MANY TIMES ALREADY! SHE LOVED THE BOOK AND NOW SHE CAN LISTEN TO ONE OF HER FAVORITE STORIES.
2,Winter Solstice,"I have been a long-time fan of Ms.Pilcher, having thoroughly enjoyed The Shell Seekers and September, I couldn't wait to begin savoring every page of this book. But, alas, sugary-sweet, slow-moving, predictable and disappointing are just a few words I could think of to describe this tale. I honestly don't know how this book made the New York Times best-seller list."
1,Disappointing,"Having read and enjoyed immensely Shell Seekers, September and Coming Home this work compares poorly. I had to give up after 200 pages. It plods along rather tediously and predictably. But what is most annoying is Pilcher's insatiable appetite for tea and alcohol. Every few pages her characters turn to one or the other. But, I must say, she is a discriptive artist sine qua non. If you haven't read the others better start with any of the above and then see if her latest is ""your cup of tea"". Come to think of it, maybe all that tea is what kept Horace so busy at every turn of the page."
1,I never read it,I never ordered this so please refund me the cost if I was charged. I read another book by this author but not this one.
2,W'inter Solstice,"I was a little disapointed in this Pilcher book, after having read a couple others of hers. I found it quitelengthy and very predictable. Kind of dull!! C.Florida"
3,A Fairy Tale,"I thought, ""what a fairy tale!"". I enjoyed it, but WOW, how many of us can really relate to what happens in this book. I do have to say though, that it almost makes me want to move to Ireland/Scotland, because she describes the enrvironment so well. Hey, who doesn't want to have all those experiences!?"
1,Tedious & implausible,"I found this book very disappointing! (I'd read ""The Shell Seekers"" & ""September"" some time ago and loved them!). Elfrida was a very unlikable character and Oscar even more so, especially the plot line of making us believe that a close romantic relationship could take place in such an ridiculously short period of time....c'mon!! When they moved into Oscar's new place shorttly after the death of his wife & child, Elfrida says he was having nightmares, ...... is the cure to have sex? Why did she feel from the start that when they moved to Oscar's new residence that he would be up for a relationship like that anyway when all along they'd been nothing but friends? How disrespectful to his dead wife and child! I tried to plod on through this book always hoping that around the corner, it would pick up and turn into a good story but everything became more & more dull and implausible. Don't bother will this one!"
2,Not as good as I expected!!,I found Winter Soltstice to be pretty boring. And I'm not one to give up on books so I read the whole thing through. ... And I'm not the type to think all this books are boring like some people b/c I love classics & things & books don't have to be fast paced for me to enjoy them. But I really couldn't stand this book. Two stars was being fair!!! I really liked it in the beginning but it tapered off to be real boring & I had to push myself to finish it. I wouldn't recommend you read this but just click on my name & see my info. & a lot of my other reviews are of good books you should read!! :)
3,A bit disappointing...,"I have to admit to being a bit disappointed with this book. The Shell Seekers, Coming Home and September are some of my favourites to reread. I still love the way she makes her characters, whether they be sixty or sixteen, so well rounded but I thought the story was terribly predictable which is not the case in her other books (read the Shell Seekers for an ending which will make you cry!) I also got a mite fed up with endless descriptions of what people wore. I found I was reading too quickly to 'cut to the chase' and skipping descriptions, maybe my fault. Its still worth a read and much better than most stuff on the market but try the others first."
4,Pilcher fabulous yet again,"I could go on and on about this book, but to review the plot again is not necessary. Let it be said that Pilcher has done it again - a fabulous read for sure. I'm sure I am not alone in saying that I hope and pray this is not her last book, as others have said in this forum, ""this book demands a sequel!"""
4,Curl up with Winter Solstice,"Winter Solstice has all the marks of a classic Pilcher novel. But as I read I felt a twinge of guilt. Guilt at reading what was obviously not great literature, guilt that I enjoyed it so. Having visited Pilcher's world before, I saw the clean and convenient storyline unfold before me. I even began to predict the next solution to the next storm in a teacup. We know these situations, and yet...they're just so darn nice to curl up with. I yearn to get back to the book on my bus commute home, and to again curl up with the book as the wind howls outside in the hours before sleep. It's THAT kind of book, no more, no less. A world where everyone eventually finds love, finds meaning, finds comfort in life, and even sometimes finds a fortune to live out the last season of ones life comfortably, by the fire, with a crystal glass of sherry or scotch, perhaps wrapped in the warmth of an old house, curled up with a good book."
5,"Marvelous, as usual!","I have only one thing to say:I desperately would like to go live with Elfrida and Oscar, Lucy, Carrie and Sam!! in Scotland! If you have read this book, no other explanation is necessary!"
3,A neat little package all tied up with a bow.,"This story was much too neat for me. It just kind of hum drums along, everyone is all sweet and nice to each other, no traumas or ordeals, just a simple start to finish story. Oscar has lost his wife and child in an auto accident, but that is the extent of the excitement in this book. The details of the accident are not given, and Oscar's grief is not elaborated upon enough for the reader to feel strongly for him. The word nauseating came to mind while I read this, but that is too strong a word for what I think was intended to be a simple story after all. It's fairly mindless, and if you have time to waste, it is not a bad choice. It is well written, but dull. The characters do not come to life, the story does not touch your heart, and the ending is predictable and boring. This author ties everything up with a neat little bow, and leaves the reader wondering why you didn't bother to write it yourself."
1,Laughable!,"Everything turns out to be picture-perfect for the characters in this book. A happily-wed, previous longtime bachelor suddenly loses his wife and daughter in an accident? No problem, he instantly hooks up with a close friend and in two months is happily living a new life. Financial problems for the couple? Of course not, suddenly we find that a forgotten clock they own is suddenly worth a fortune! And they even inherit a house from a complete stranger! A teenager lives a miserable life with her mother and grandmother in London and suddenly discovers happiness? Easy! Just whisk her away with some strangers to Scotland and force the reader to suspend his disbelief into believing she would be allowed. An so on...Some people will enjoy this saccharine-sweet story, but for me life simply isn't the way Pilcher portays it. For her, people are either loving or selfish, and I don't buy this. It is exasperating to read this oversimplification of the complexities of life."
2,Mistyped,"To start, I LOVE this book.But, the kindle edition is horrible! Spelling errors, typos on almost every page. It is ridiculous and takes you out of the story.Large = TargeBuckly = buddyI = /And many many more. Did they OCR the text and forget to proofread?I would try to get my money back,, but there is no way to do that for kindle orders that I can find.Buy the paperback or hardcover."
4,Disappointing Story,"Rosamunde Pilcher's ""The Shell Seekers"" is my very favorite novel and I re-read it at least once a year. I was looking forward to this latest book, but have found it somehow lacking. Remember in Shell Seekers when Penelope says to Noel, ""I feel somehow I have failed you""? That's how I feel about this book.The story is too predictable and I found myself skimming through the last chapters after reading the first few to find out who the characters were.Maybe I will go back for another reading later, but I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed with this latest book of Mrs. Pilcher's."
3,Disappointment for Pilcher Fans,"I read this as one of our bookclub selections - we were all disappointed. Characters were weak, not to mention numerous and confused in their motivations. The plot echoes the Shell Seekers, which is a classic! If you are looking for a book you can't put down, rush a copy of Shell Seekers to your home. The plot in Solstice is jumbly - how everyone ends up living in the one house is beyond me. In this day and age, even in remote Scotland, it's considered dangerous and foolish to take in a man off the street and keep him with you for days on end when you know nothing about him. Yet this is a major element of the plot. On the plus side, the book is heartwarming and everyone gets their happy endings, even if they are a bit contrived."
5,WINTER WARMTH,"I LOVE STORIES WERE PEOPLE COME TOGETHER AS IF BY FATE AND FIND MEANING IN THEIR LIFE BY FILLING EACH OTHER'S GAPS. THIS STORY TAKES PLACE DURING A COLD, COLD WINTER, YET IT MADE ME FEEL WARM AND COZY."
4,Beautific and restful,"I've read Rosamunde since I was a teenager and her ability to transport the reader to the hills and beaches of Oscars homeland still amazes me. Easy and complex at once, like all of us I guess, are the folks you'll get to know upon reading this gem!"
3,winter solstice,The writing is well done but I found the plot very slow moving and quite contrived. All in all it was a disappointment and not up to Pilcher's usual standards.
4,So comfortable.,"Listening to the audiotape of this Rosamunde Pilcher book is like sitting down by the fire for a comforting hot cup of tea. And that's saying a lot because I listened to it over several weeks in my car during my commute. Her descriptions really give you a sense of place, and you really come to know her characters. Her world becomes so familiar, you're happy to be able to visit again and again, even if you're on the freeway in California and she's describing rainy Scotland. The only drawback of this audiotape for me was the narrator. She can have an awfully assertive style sometimes. I really don't think the characters were being as assertive as she was, half the time. But that doesn't take away from the story. Little could."
5,Wonderfully Descriptive,This was my first read of Pilcher. With her descriptions I felt like I was right there. It was a pure pleasure to read a novel without erotic sex. She made the characters come alive. I felt like I knew them and they flash to mind even now. It was a terrific lesson on accepting people as they are.
3,Not her best...,"On a bad day, Rosamunde Pilcher is still a really good writer. But I have to say, it wasn't such a great day when she was writing this one. While books like this are all about happy endings, the twists and turns of the plot in this one are so obvious that halfway through, I could pretty much have told you the entire rest of the story. That might be ok if the characters themselves had any depth or complexity, but they're all pretty much stock characters... the one with the broken heart, the child with uncaring parents, and so on. You could take them out of any other novel, mix them up, and there you are. Not that I didn't enjoy the book... I did, but it's probably the worst of her full length novels. Start with something else; read this when you've run out of other ones."
4,Winter Solstice is Winter Comfort,"Winter Solstice is a perfect read for the month of December or anytime you are looking for a bit of comfort in the written word. Set in Scotland during the month of the winter solstice, Rosamunde Pilcher creates a cozy, feel-good read with vivid descriptions and lovable characters. This is a novel that you will want to take your time with so that you can appreciate the writer's talent for artful description and spend the time getting to know the 5 central characters. This group of unlikely friends find themselves thrown together by unique circumstances and discover an instant kinship. You will feel a part of the family when you see what life is like inside The Estate House with Oscar, Elfrida, Carrie, Lucy & Sam who each bring to us their own set of troubles as well as delights. Pilcher explores the ups and downs of life; how we need to live it to its fullest and the comfort and importance of love."
5,"Ms.Pilcher, a wonderful writer","This was the first Rosamunde Pilcher book I had read a few years back. As soon as I was finished with it I started collecting and reading everything she had written. Her novels are moving and real. The Shellseekers and Coming Home were also memorable, I didn't want them to end. Her books make me want to live in England and Scotland and experience everything she's writen about. I love her, I'm hoping she is still writing as it would be a great loss if she has stopped."
4,Don't like the reader,"I am liking this book quite a lot except for the audio book reader. She reads in a sort of deadpan, upper crust English accent and it is really annoying (at least to an American ear)."
4,"Terrific, but not quite up to standard set by Coming Home","This was a very, very good read, but not quite up to the level of her previous three novels: Shell Seekers, September and Coming Home, all of which were excellent reads which I could not put down. In contrast I was able to put down Winter Solstice, though, I enjoyed coming back to it."
2,Not as good as Pilcher's earlier books,"I thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Pilcher's earlier books, with September being my favorite; however, this book was a disappointment. I felt very uncomfortable with the short grieving time span for Oscar. Elfrida and Oscar began their relationship a week or two after the funeral! And, I find it highly doubtful that they would have been accepted so quickly into the society of the little village. Also, does anyone else get a little annoyed that the frumpily dressed are always wonderful, while the stylishly dressed are calculating, snobby villains? (Lucy's mother has the audacity to match her purse and shoes!) And what about 3 separate extramarital affairs in the book that are depicted as noble and worthwhile? I finished the book, but it was a struggle. P. S. Do people in Scotland really drink that much?"
2,"Repetitive, predictable","Although I do enjoy Pilcher's writing style, I found the book repetitive and predictable. The chapter's written by Lucy seemed to restate the obvious and even the narrator, Elfrida's descriptions were tedious and repetitive. I would be reading along and often wonder why the editor had not deleted entire pages, even chapters that rambled on without saying anything. For instance, the chapter towards the end of the book where Elfrida goes to visit Tabitha to borrow drinking glasses. There's an entire page written about scraping the ice off the windscreen and getting the car started. Once she finally gets to Tabitha's the conversation between the women does not provide the reader any new information and has no point. It almost seems like dialog was added as an afterthought to thicken the book. So not to be totally critical, I did find the characters believable and enjoyed Pilcher's descriptions of the outdoors."
3,Unfortunately,"I just couldn't get through it. I'm not a true page turner addict, but this was quite slow. Still a nice story. I ordered the Shell Seekers and will give this author another try."
5,Winter Soltice,"I will read any book by Pilcher. I started with Shell Seekers .Then September,Winter Solstice and am now in to Coming Home."
1,A must for insomniacs,"I've read other Pilcher books and this was, by far, her worst. The characters were extremely boring and I had no interest in finding out about their lives. If you want a novel that will numb your senses and keep you yawning for hours, then this is the book for you."
3,"Interesting, but TOO long.","Before I finished this book I expected to give it 1 star. The last 150-200 pages however, made me change my mind. This is the story of 5 strangers coming together out of different cicumstances and change each others life for the better. About 250 pages of this book could have been eliminated and it would have still told the same story. Ms. Pilcher is way too descriptive of everything. This does give you a very good idea of how it would be to visit with english or scottish friends. I've been there 3 times and it brought back warm fuzzy memories. This book is not bad, its just too long and drawn out and not all the story lines are brought to a conclusion, I guess we're left to draw our own conclusions. Be prepared to skim the text a little if you want to get to the end!"
3,A let-down for fans of The Shell Seekers,"I would not recommend this book to anyone else who loves The Shell Seekers, because it's just too disappointing. There are many similarities between the The Shell Seekers' characters and those in Winter Solstice (i.e. their ages, personal tragedies, and cottage/castle/coastline environments), and the several love relationships came across as nearly carbon copies. However, I did not find myself identifying in any positive ways with the characters in the later book--they seem shallower, too perfect (perfectly bad or perfectly good), and the story line is very predictable and not particularly enticing. If you haven't read any of Pilcher's books before, this isn't a bad story; but for Shell Seeker devotees who are still interested, I suggest that you at least save your money and wait for the paperback version. :("
1,"Poorly written, plodding and predictable. . . .","This is the first book of Ms. Pilcher's I have read, and sadly, it will be the last. While the story was initially engaging, it quickly became plodding and dull. Ms. Pilcher shows a tremendous paucity and redundancy of language, and the story was inconsistent in its details. It has the stereotypic and formulaic quality of a paperback romance novel. The effort to paint quirky characters felt flat, especially when compared to a classic such as Shipping News by E. Annie Proulx. Rather than connecting with the characters, I simply became bored and quit with 100 pages to go. A shame; I truly wanted to enjoy this book."
1,Don't Get It,"I am amazed at how many people like this book. It was a snooze fest for me. I love Scotland, but I don't need to read about it so much that it is practically a character in the book. I like more interesting characters and plots. To me, it was a boring book."
2,Just couldn't get into the book,Maybe it's the whole ENGLISH thing that's hard for me but I read through chapter 2 and couldn't get into this book.... back to the library it went unread.
2,Great Mix,I was just mucking around listening 2 some music when i came across this cd and i decided to give it a listen. This has pretty catchy and interesting beats from the review songs. I would recommend this cd 2 anyone that is in2 rap. This cd deserves a 4 and a half instead of a 5 because the way some songs are put 2gether...well rnt that great Yeah so give this a try
3,"Beautiful, but not great","This kettle is very nice looking, which is the main reason why I bought it, but it is not exceptional in quality. The whistle works on and off and it is not especially fast."
4,A collection of socially dynamical play spaces,"This book shows its roots in the late 60s, early 70s, and yet it still holds a great deal of originality. Stewart Brand reveals in the opening essay that he wanted to get hippies out of their heads, when they were busy protesting the war. So he organized a physical game, called Slaughter, where people had to work to pull (not push) each other off a mat. The games outlined in this book include some new, some old (British bull dog), and some that may have been new at the time but now are classics (Frisbee golf). Another aspect of this that seems dated is the attempt to bind in a book a lot of social practices that were evolving; it seems so compelling today to think of how much such a write up would benefit from being a web site rather than a paperback."
3,Looks nice but doesnt hold up very well,Felt great the first number of times I used the product...however it now has sags from my weight (190 lbs). Next time I will go with a thicker foam.
1,Hard as a board!,I used a foam roller in my Physical Therapy. This roller was so hard it hurt my shoulder. It did not feel good at all.
1,Emotional Sobriety,"It's was a simple but profound recipe to become useful to self.Self empowerment through the process of fixing my emotions deformed by fear, fear of abondonment!Daily adjusting my toxic thinking by moving a muscle, jogging.All of the above possible because i am never alone. I have my Higher Power to help me.It taught me the joys of emotional sobriety!By the way, I am learning to ride a Harley..... the journey continues ..."
3,God on a Harley,The book arrived in the condition stated and within a reasonal time frame.The story itself was one i had read years ago and was happy to find again.
3,it's just ok,"I really thought I might connect with this book, but unfortunately it fell way flat of my expectations. I am 37, going through a divorce and wanting a career change. On the plus side, I'd love someday to be a writer but never thought I had the talent. Now I know that talent is not needed! The message of the book was ok...but that's all...ok. There are so many other books (parables and allegories) that say what this one did so much better. I'm amazed at all the 5 stars."
5,God on a Harley: A Spiritual Fable,"I was told to read this book by a very mysterious person months ago. It took me nine months to actually purchase the book. I still do not know why I waited so long. From the moment I received the book I couldn't put it down. The cover says it all ""IF YOU'VE EVER HAD A BROKEN HEART...."" read this wonderful book. It really helps you understand yourself and makes you realize that you can learn to love by learning & loving yourself first."
5,New Improved Ponty Music,"I have just listened to Life Enigma for the third time in a row.It is fantastic!I've been a fan since the early 70's.This album has all the great elements of a classic Ponty album-great melodies,beautiful harmonic changes,driving rythms, vituoso performances and cutting edge production and sound quality.The more I listen the better it gets!Bravo Jean-Luc!"
5,"""Life Enigma"" is fascinating!","It's really interesting to hear the different things going on musically here that Jean-Luc Ponty does. On a few songs like ""Two Thousand-One Years Ago"" and ""Lonely Among All,"" Ponty goes solo and plays violin (obviously), keyboards and electronic percussion. That gives them some air and room to breathe. But his talented band is featured on several songs too, and my favorite cuts here are ""Signals From Planet Earth"" and ""Firmament"" as well as ""The Infinite Human Caravan,"" ""Life Enigma"" and ""Even The Sun Will Die."" Since Ponty is unique as a jazz violinist, to hear him play with his band in a jazz structure is somehow both familiar and fresh. The sound quality is amazing too -- crisp and rich. Ponty's violin has a very warm sound, even when hitting high notes. I think ""Life Enigma"" is one of those records that rewards listeners with repeated listenings because each time I've listened to it, something new has jumped out at me."
4,Life Enigma is a Marvelous one,"I have been followed Jean-Luc Ponty since seventies and he is undoubtedly one of the most talented musicians in the world. Moreover his masterful virtue toward violin/keyboard playing is unique. ""Life Enigma"" (Ponty's lastest album) shows his ability to compose and perform as an ""icon"" inside Jazz Music today. I highly recommend to listen it and let you enjoy the magic sound and quality involved. Ponty's inspiration and sound surely will satisfy your highest expectations...."
2,"Ouch! Zinged, except for one song","If you can pick this CD up [inexpensively] there is one exceptional track titled ""Even the Sun Will Die"". Otherwise the lack of real sidemen is just too much off a turnoff for me. Someone like Jan Hammer can pull this kind of thing off but this effort nearly completely lacks originality. Sorry, as I am a real fan and expected much, much more."
3,Life Enigma,"Not my favorite Ponty, but good nonetheless. Even The Sun Will Die is my favorite track followed by And Life Goes On. Great for a lazy day around the house or for a long drive."
3,I ordered this in error.,I misunderstood the web site but feel the material was very informative. I do not have the time nor interest in reading the volume of data in this voluminous works. I thought I was going to receive a CD.
1,Urantia-don't bother,The hype on this particular piece far excedes the substance. It provides no real answers to those on a search for spiritual truth and utilizes a fanciful story along the lines of Star Trek to address the serious questions that eventually arise in our lives.
1,More bureacracy under Heaven than you can shake a stick at,"Buy this if you want something to flip open to at random for amusement and rare insights. Also, a wide number of the ideas contained therein were gleaned from '30s notions and various religions without reference, but (and you know it's a classic because) other small groups have since gleaned ideas (such as Thought Adjusters) from this book. So for some obscure reference possibilities, sure, maybe.For a basis of belief, though? If the universe is actually as crammed packed with such a tediously granular and rigid bureaucracy and hierarchy as this book claims, I'll side with the Rebellion. No, wait, the Rebellion Urantia style was too boring (involving comminiques and diplomats and lengthy debates, all of which was somehow cause to disintegrate Lucifer, simply for expressing and discussing his opinion). I think I'll just go solo."
4,The Quiet Contenders.,"With me, Shai's best asset was that they didn't have to scream or blast their music and words to get the point across. It just wasn't their style and I really appreciated that. With this collection, the best of their recordings are compacted in their serene, yet suggestive manner, and it made quite a package. As a added treat, IF I EVER FALL IN LOVE, is released in both the original A Cappella version and the remix. Either or both will strike a chord with fans who loved that four part harmony. Their career together may have been too short, but the talent they possessed will carry on throughtout the quiet storms stations for a very long time."
1,"Win some, lose some.","This CD is quite a disappointment. It is a very poor recording and in my mind should not be for sale. I am a die hard Marley fan and as I have all of his albums, I risked fate and purchased a few of these Japanese label live recordings. I hope this is the worst of the bunch or I will be back writing another review.Consider yourself warned. I can't recommend this CD to any class of reggae or more specifically Marley fan."
4,"Not a bad tripod, but....","This is a pretty decent tripod, for the price. However, don't be misled by the ""fluid effect head."" That's why I happened to buy this particular tripod, and it turns out that I already owned one!I had purchased a tripod made by Ambico which was almost identical about 14 months prior to this purchase. At the place where I bought it, it cost me around 20 bucks. I had decided to get a different tripod because the fluid effect head wasn't nearly fluid enough for me. When this one finally came, I compared the two, and my old one worked just as good as this one.If you're looking for a cheap tripod that gives you great bang for your buck, then this tripod is for you. If, however, you're looking for a tripod that truly is fluid, look somewhere else. Oh. And if you're going to get this tripod, shop around a bit. You might be able to find it cheaper elsewhere."
3,Paid $13 - Worth $13,"I guess all the budget tripods are probably similar. I was a bit disappointed by how cheaply made the tripod is. It's just a bunch of plastic which makes me worried about bending a leg or snapping off a cheap joint.But it does do the job. It's too light to be very steady, but it holds your camera and allows you stability in the absence of wind. It has a hood on the bottom from which you can tie a bag of rocks for extra stability. And it comes with two quick-change plates - a nice feature for such a budget item."
4,Great P&S Tripod,"This tripod is very good. The only one bad thing I can think of is all the plastic. The knobs and crank are all plastic, giving this tripod a cheap feeling."
4,Nice to have these on CD,"These CDs, from Savoy Jazz, are terrific as they resurrect material from Judy's 1963/1964 TV series. Many of the offerings presented are songs that she never recorded in the studio and also didn't regularly perform in concert, so it's a good opportunity to pick up material not normally associated with Judy.The sound quality is good...it's variable at times because the songs came from several different episodes. And, Judy's voice is sometimes better than other times.But, let's not quibble with those details. It's terrific that Savoy is putting these out (the 4th compilation, due in August 2007, features a Carnegie Hall-like recording of her biggest hits...but all from the TV show and all done as if it's a single concert) and that this music is seeing the light of day from the TV series. She was a one-of-a-kind, once-in-a-lifetime performer and it's all good that they mine all of the sources so we can continue to enjoy Judy's work almost 40 years after her death."
3,Beautiful but there's better mobiles out there that match,"After receiving the Arcadia bedding for my son's crib I realized I didn't have the mobile. Instead of spending the $40, I took the valance with me to see if I could find an alternative. Fisher Price makes a Nature Bearies line that matches the pastel colors and it has a light that projects above the crib with nightlight and even comes with remote control. The best thing is when he outgrows the mobile it converts into a table light. It was only $29 versus the $40 for a beautiful but limited mobile."
3,The Arcadia Mobile Is Cute,"The Arcadia Mobile is cute! That's all! It was not worth $40.00. There is not very much developmental about the mobile. I bought it because it matched the Arcadia bedding set. If you are not interested in matching the mobile with the bedding; I advise you to get an developmental mobile if you are going to pay the price of $40.00 for ""just a cute"" mobile. If I had to do over again....I would have purchased an developmental mobile. TFHC"
2,Poor quality,"I bought this mobile to match the bedding, and it looks cute...but after only a few weeks of using it, the mobile is already off tune! I am very disappointed in the quality."
3,Great for all levels of Electrical expertise...,"Unless you ""Know it all"" and ""can remember it all"", this isa very handy book. Eliminates a lot of guessing and overengineering. Used this book for Years!"
2,Ugly's Electrical Reference,"I've ordered several used books, and have never been disappointed till now. Yes it was only a penny, but It's not the first book I bought cheap. I certainly don't expect perfection at these prices, and have been surprised by the condition of quite a few. In this particular case the pages were stuck together, I was able to separate most of them without damage but that should never be necessary. I have done many reviews and I think this may be the first negative one I've had to do, bound to happen eventually.DagW00d"
2,Very poorly written,"I love the subject and was looking forward to reading it. However, I deleted the book from my Kindle after 2 chapters. It contained a muddled plot as well"
4,Great novel needs proofreading!,"I just finished reading ""Past Recall"" by Nita Hughes. Usually, I do not write reviews of books I read. This is an exception. Because I liked the compelling narrative, I must point out a few of the very large number of typos and inaccuracies that appear in the text and detract from the reading pleasure of this fast paced historical novel. For instance, as a purported admirer of the Cathares, the author should know the correct spelling of the Trencavel name (not Trencaval); moreover, the correct expression is ""bons hommes"" and ""bonnes dammes"", not ""bonshommes"" and ""bonsdammes"" (p32 et seq). The text would greatly benefit from proofreading by someone familiar with the French language (errors are too numerous to be listed here). Hopefully, future editions of this book will include these corrections. This being said, Nita Hughes has a fascinating and unique style that demonstrates a rare talent."
5,One of the best boxing movies ever made .,Paul Newman does an exellent portrayal of a young and future middleweight champion. Rocky Graziano was one of the most colerful fighters of his time. Newman and Rocky worked together and spent alot of time making this movie believable.
3,at least it made paul newman a star,"i had always been intrigued by the idea of the gorgeous paul newman playing pug rocky graziano, and after finally seeing this movie, i remain wondering ""what were they thinking?"" newman does a fine job, but it still strains credulity to be watching him as (even a young version of) the man people of my generation best recall as merv griffins punchy sidekick. the movie itself is a decent straight biopic, and if youre a boxing fan, you will probably enjoy it."
1,Motorcycle Superstore Review,"This review is about the seller of these boots, rather than the boots themselves. 11 days ago I placed the order for these boots, never having received a shipment notification... I emailed Motorcycle Superstore for an update. My reply from them came in the form of issuing a credit, no notifications, no explainations. While I am very pleased to have my funds returned for an item that I did not receive... it seems to me that a communication of any sort, be it an out of stock issue or other issues that would prevent the order shipping would be a good business practice."
2,not a great price and not as good of a product as metamuucil,"I did not like the taste and for various reasons, this is not as good of a product than metamucil."
1,Worthless product,I agree with the reviewer from Houston. My old rabbit ears work better and I don't have to waste electricity by plugging it in. Rabbit ears pick up 13 channels. The Philips SCA050 Indoor Amplified UHF/VHF/FM/HDTV Antenna picks up three channels but fuzzier and they were all VHF.There is no info on the Philips website. After a few phone calls I finally got a customer service agent who treated me like an idiot and had no answers.Save yourself some money and go to the closet and pull out a wire hanger.
4,"Great Antenna, but don't break the ears!",This antenna works great as long as you don't break one of the rabbit ears. The rabbit ears are delicate and don't turn easily. I have to return the antenna and I am waiting for the replacement.
1,not happy,I'M not at all happy with my Philips sca050 antenna.The antenna does not come with the 12v DC power cord. Please be advised? Do not puchase unless you are abie to get the right type of cord.The cord you will need is a 12vDC 100ma. I do hope this helps. Thanks; J.C.
4,Cute for the price,These were really cute earrings...my only drawback would be my hair tends to get caught on them often. The setting sticks out a bit farther than I kind of like but overall a nice pair of earrings for the price
2,"Directions, please?","Has anyone else been unable to read the directions on the back of the bottle? At least on the container I have, the font is white on a yellow background and I can't make out the words. Should I apply and then leave it or rinse it out, or let it dry and vacuum it? No idea. I think it probably works, but I would like to use it as directed."
3,every pinko's dreamworld,"Joe Wilson is the President, Valerie Plame runs the CIA, her primary objective is to get a pardon for her friend and mentor, who was blackmailed over sex with underage girls (this part is breathtakingly Clintonesque) into working for KGB and who is serving his sentence now.Some retired CIA pinko vigilante assassinates Jesse Helms, Rush Limbaugh, Bob Novak, Pat Robertson, William Rehnquist and Newt Gingrich.Everything comes out like a dream, really: every good person is in love and has the most satisfying sex of his/her life, Valerie's friend gets the pardon, the pinko vigilante gets away with murder, the CIA is still penetrated by the Russians - the life is truly beautiful.There is only one small cloud in the bright sky: Pat Robertson survived the assassiantion."
2,A good beach book,"As a long-time fan of Stuart Woods, I just hate to say it but his novels are just getting too simple, predictable and just plain mediocre, and this book is not an exception. Both the characters and story are not very well developed in this one. I like my thrillers to be a bit more challenging and provide a little more excitement. I always liked the Will Lee character, so thought I was in for a good read. However, Will's role is on the sidelines and the new character, Kinney, just doesn't have a lot of depth. It was just very light reading suitable for a time when one wants to lie on the beach and not have to think too much."
1,Don't waste your time,"I started with Wood's first book, ""Chiefs,"" and he did a wonderful job on it. ""Chiefs"" is well written, has an excellent plot and a good start at character development. The final chapters make sense and are certainly surprising. I enjoyed that book a great deal and was looked forward to reading more of his workI'm sorry to say, however, that while Chiefs seems to be the work of an author with a great deal of literary future, Wood's later books, including this one, show that he has sold his soul to pulp fiction - for the money. I have now read five of his later books, hoping upon hope that one of them would be as good as ""Chiefs."" None are. They are predictable, boring, repetitive, poorly written. In each book many of the events are highly improbable and Woods stretches far, far too much to make the story continue into another smellable volume. Don't be fooled. They all get boring. Don't buy them. ""Chiefs"" is the only good one."
3,"An OK read, but I like the Stone Barrington series better...","I'm back from our Christmas trip to visit the relatives, so it's time to get caught up on a book review. Yesterday I started (and finished) Capital Crimes by Stuart Woods. Woods brings back one of his earlier characters (Will Lee) in this political crime mystery. I must say I like the Stone Barrington novels better... A serial killer is starting to pick off a number of right-wing government officials and media celebrities. A web site is discovered that shows who is on the list to be killed, and the FBI has to figure it out quickly before he strikes again. Perhaps it's because I haven't read the prior Will Lee novels in awhile, but this book lacked any depth or substance. The story is OK, but the characters are just ""there"". Not much development if they were meant to stand on their own in this book. If there's no other recreational reading to be had, I'd say go for it, but if you have other titles you want to start first, this one can wait."
3,Very Predictable!,"As a sometimes fan of Stuart Woods, and as a reader of all the Will Lee novels, I picked this book up to stay in the loop. Let me say that I loved Chiefs, liked Grass Roots and Run Before the Wind, and tolerated The Run. However, this was just all too predictable from beginning to end. Mr. Woods puts out so many books that it seems like he is just spewing words out of his computer. If you are looking for a thriller, read David Baldacci's Split Second."
2,Is this the same author who wrote Chiefs?,I thought this book was hard to get through. I have enjoyed all of Stuart Woods' books but this one I found a bit boring. Not near the caliber of his other books in the Will Lee series.
2,Democrats rule - Republicans drool - geesh!,"A very disappointing and not-so-novel premise of bumbling, stupid, inept, hypocritical right-wing Republicans, sleezing their way through Capital Hill with the saavy, young, energetic, superior intellectual Democrats covering their asses. This book oozes of polital bias and a lame plot complete with the FBI director actually satisfied, well, let's say not disappointed, with the sniper shooting of one of the victims, a conservative SOB (all conservatives are in this book)who is a senator. As an avid reader, I just get tired of the same predictable stories and villains in current fiction. Do authors honestly think their readers are buying (no pun intended) this fodder? Woods needs to stick with the Barrington line and phase out the Will Lee novels if this is all he can come up with. Trust me, this is no ""Chiefs"", which is unfortunate."
4,The second story with president Will Lee,"Much better than THE RUN, which was the first book about Will Lee, and this one is the story of an ex-CIA boy deciding who needs to die. Excellent story that will keep you riveted until the last page and continued in a Holly Barker novel, IRON ORCHID. Before you read IRON ORCHID, read the Holly Barker novels that precede this one, ORCHID BEACHE, ORCHID BLUES, AND BLOOD ORCHID. The story line is all tied in. I love the way Dino and Stone are brought into these books in minor ways...we know the characters and love to hear from them in each book. Woods is a skilled master and every story is enjoyable..."
3,Quite enjoyable and really 3+ stars,"A good, quick thriller read. I could barely put it down. Stone Barrington is a little slick for me at times. This Will Lee book is just right even though Will Lee is a peripheral character. This book also reminds me a little bit of Baldacchi another great thriller writer. Hope that Woods brings Kinney back, the real hero here. I'm amazed that the author can juggle 3 series."
1,This guy writes worse than Dan Brown,"Inept writing. It's amazing that Stuart Woods has been so successful. His writing is heavy-handed, clumsy, awkward. The man has no touch, no feel for writing, no style. Reading this novel is like reading a script. No character development; we get no feel for what's going through the characters' minds or why they behave the way they do. The liberals are all wonderful people. The Republicans are all scoundrels who drink too much and are mean to their wives. We end up rooting for the villain because he's the only interesting character in the book."
3,"Weak story, interesting style","I'm not an avid reading of mystery novels and generally don't read political fiction but I started this book at my daughter's house and rather enjoyed it. I gather from other comments that this isn't his best novel and I too found much of the events predictable while others seemed to be too contrived. I read this novel not so much as a reader looking for a compelling story but as a writer who found myself turning pages at a regular pace because the construction had me hooked. I found the transition from chapter to chapter to be very reader friendly and it kept the story moving quickly, even as it moved from one character to another and over many state lines. Other reviewers are correct when they say characters are not developed well or some not at all. There are many reasons for reading a book and I guess, in this story, for me, style was more important than content."
1,Will Lee Made it to the White House,"CAPITAL CRIMES by Stuart Woods doesn't improve the character of Will Lee in the fifth book of this series. The only thing that keeps readers coming back to Mr. Woods's work is the power of his prose.Without a doubt, Stuart Woods is a fine writer, but the Will Lee series started at the top and has taken a long slop down as he has distanced himself from his roots.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
2,"Quality Acetal, Poor Dimensional Accuracy","I expected this piece of Acetal to be in clean, machine shop condition. It arrived from Amazon scratched up and almost looked used. That really isn't my big complaint though, I'm most annoyed the material received is not actually 1/4"" as advertised. I'm not sure if Amazon is shipping from different suppliers, or someone just didn't take the time to measure, but the piece has "".250"" and ""6mm"" printed on it. Obviously, both of these measurements cannot be accurate, as .250""=6.35mm and 6mm=.236"". According to my calibrated caliper, both measurements are incorrect, as I measured 6.89mm or .271"". This wouldn't be a issue if you're just planning on using it to make some spare part where thickness isn't critical, but if an engineering plan calls for .250"", then you are now stuck with machining the face, which takes up time and add to tool wear."
2,Not whats advertised,"the finish has tooling scores all over and its 3/8th of an inch smaller and a 16th thinner than the 12x12x1/2 it lists itself to be, otherwise it was packaged rather well considering its just a slab of plastic"
2,Misrepresented dimensional specifications. OK product,"If this was the first review to comment on size, I would give Amazon a break. But after 18 months of similar comments, it is clearly their intention to misrepresent this product.Other suppliers provide Acetal with + 1/8""/- 0"" dimensions; Amazon claims +0""/-.1/8"" but supplies -.1/4"". This makes Amazon one of the most expensive suppliers of this product.Either their material manager obtained his experience in the lumber industry or Amazon simply believes that their customers are uninformed and don't know better."
3,If you want to learn (jesus' life) across the gospel luke,If you want to learn(jesus' life) across the gospel luke is good recommendation. The gospel according to Matthew is better production.
3,Told from the Gospel of Luke.,"This was told from the Gospel of Luke. It is a nice story, Slightly dated. If I saw this used for a few dollars, I might pick it up."
5,Great Movie,"For this movie being so old, it is very good. Gets right to the point of who Jesus is. Great for young kids."
5,Excellent and clear life of Jesu,"Bought this video to use in church. It's an excellent and clear film of the life of Christ. Not all events are shown (ie it's not a composite of the four gospels of the Bible - only Luke). Starting to look a little dated, but it really doesn't matter. Millions have seen this film in dozen's of languages and many have decided to follow Christ because of it. highly recommended."
5,A wonderful depiction of Christ's life and mission,"This is absolutely one of the very best movies ever made about the life of Christ. Since it is almost word for word from the Bible, except for a few conversational interactions, such as greetings, etc., you can be sure it is true to God's word. One thing I love about it is that it shows Him as a strong man (He WAS a carpenter, after all.) rather than a milk toast as He is usually depicted. The only thing I did not like was that since they wanted to stay true to the book of John, they didn't put a crown of thorns on his head, because although Matthew, Mark, and Luke all do describe the crown, John does not. Yet, you can't fault their resolve to be absolutely true to that account. If you saw Mel Gibson's The Passion of Christ movie, and felt the crucifiction scenes were a little too much for younger children, then this is the best choice out of all other movies made."
2,Disappointing Compilation,"Other than Meli'sa Morgan's smoldering hot version of ""Sexual Healing"", there's not much here to talk about. Probably would have been better if there were more vocals but the rest of the CD just sounds like your ordinary, run-of-the-mill smooth jazz."
4,pretty good Goodies,"This DVD has three episodes from the Goodies, a British sit-com from the early 70s. The first episode is from early on in their production, and apparently the two other episodes are from later years.Kitten Kong is THE BEST Goodies episode ever, with G or PG rated humor I can enjoy watching with my kids. It is also truly funny humor for old and young alike, featuring a turtle doing calistenics, and a giant kitten terrorizing Britain. There were tons of good belly laughs in this first episode.It's too bad the Goodies later tried to be something more for ""grown ups"" with more ""adult"" humor. This ruined the fun. The second episode isn't too terrible, but the third episode makes numerous ""gay"" jokes that are inappropriate for young audiences."
3,The Goodies,"I used to watch this show and while these 3 episodes are ok, I would not have picked them as the best."
3,Good enough,"My four-year-old son enjoys this playset, although the quality isn't any better than your run-of-the-mill plastic dinosaurs. The little trees are a nice addition to the set, but all in all, it's pretty overpriced for what you get."
4,Dinosaur Lovers!!!!!,My nephew has every possible dinosaur in the world. Was nice to give him this as a gift - and find out that he didn't have this!!! His reaction was priceless. Really made his day!!!!
2,not a good deal for the money,There are much better frames out there. Also note that this frame has a very large and unattractive logo on the front.
3,an eye sore logo,"The picture frame works fine though the resolution is not so good. However, the frame has a logo at the lower right corner (like one of the review said) which is very tacky. The manufacturer should consider either removing that or replacing it with a nicer logo."
1,Fully Assembled Doesn't Mean Fully Assembled,"I ordered this easel from Tri Dee in Washington State. The ad described it as ""fully assembled."" Before hitting the ""buy"" button I called the company and their sales rep ""Jerry"" assured me that all I had to do was open the box and start painting. Needless to say I was appalled to receive a box of planks and a half-page of blurry instructions. When I called Tri Dee to complain they passed me off to the manufacturer (Richeson). All I got from them was a detailed discourse on the meaning of the phrase ""fully assembled."" Another e-shopping Gotcha! P.S. This is a great easel but don't buy it online unless you or someone close to you has carpentry skills."
1,Useless product,"The product that arrived was ""Homeopathic"" meaning that it had virtually none of the remedy it professed to contain. It was not advertised as ""Homeopathic."" Had it been, I would not have purchased it. It was totally ineffective in use. ""Hylands Homeopathic"" is a rip-off!"
4,Refreshing,"I was invited to give this a listen. Glad I did! If you are into 'Mellow' there's a song on here for you. Connye Florance has a nice voice, smooth and sultry. I particularly like ""Strange Thing"" and ""Memories of You"". She has a bright career ahead and I'm looking forward to hearing more from her."
3,"Classic Leon Russell tunes, BUT RE-RECORDED","There are some classic Russell tunes contained here for sure , but these are re-recorded versions, NOT THE ORIGINALS.I thought was pretty good for redone stuff, but I personally prefer the original versions as I first heard them ions ago.Luckily, I only paid a buck for it at my local thrift shop brand new."
5,Leon Russell Rocks,I love this CD. It has some amazing melodies on it. I recommend it to any Leon Russell fan.
5,Nice,"Mostly bare-bone versions of Leon's greatest songs. The mood is one of being in Leon's parlor as he digs into his repertoire. I especially liked ""Out In The Woods"", but it's all good. This CD was hard to find-good to see it back in print."
2,Another tepid NBC fantasy miniseries.,"Brendan Fraser look-a-like Jason London stars as the titular hero, Jason, who goes on a quest to retrieve the golden fleece to save his mother's life. Expensive miniseries has a very lavish look and impressive production values, but suffers from a plodding pace, cheesy CGI effects (though the dragon-monster is pretty good), lack of good humor, and mostly flat acting. Picks up a bit in the exciting finale, but not enough to redeem all 3 hours. Good score from Simon Boswell."
4,Jason & The Argonauts - The miniseries,"This is the newly revised NBC miniseries now being released onto DVD.With improved visual effects and more details into the actual storyline.The story tells of Jason and his band of heroes on their quest to find the Golden Fleece.The monsters and deities were reconstucted using CG imagery and even though posidon wasn't your expected trident weilding god, the story still holds.If you've liked previous grand fantasy miniseries (which always seem to creep up on sweeps), this one's for you."
1,Fails to Deliver,"Ugh, this should have been great. With some great supporting cast, the special effects abilities of today's studios, the budgets used for mini-series' such as this, and so on, this should have been fantastic. If you're looking for a film version of the classic myths and legends of Jason and the Argonauts, this isn't it. Not only does the film suffer from a weak script and a lead actor who has all the emoting capabilities of Keanu Reeves, but over half of the basic elements of the story are missing (the Sirens, Aeetes' warship fleet, Circe turning the men into swine, the stranding of the Argo on dry land, the Garden of Hesperides) and most remaining elements are wildly inaccurate (Jason's father, Pelias' son, Heracles/Hercules, the fate of just about all the Argonauts, etc.) As a story in it's own right... eh, it's just there - nothing special."
2,Very Disappointing - Movie Squanders Original Mythology,"Sugarplums were dancing in my head when I made this purchase. I actually turn DVD off halfway through viewing only to be extremely disappointed with remake of original classic mythological tale. Long live Ray Harryhausen for his special effects will long outlive this movie's production. Acting is terrible, plot is a failed attempt at trying to perfect something that is already perfect. Sorry viewers but if you're after the nostalgia of the original film it'll greatly disappoint. Maddening how this movie might hinder someone from watching the original."
4,Jason in the English Class,"I've used *Jason and the Argonauts* in my freshman English classes (high school) after our unit on the *Odyssey*. I thought it would complement the *Odyssey* nicely by expanding the students' understanding of the Greek concept of the hero while exposing them to another Greek myth, *Jason and the Golden Fleece*, on which this is based. (It takes liberties, but....) The special effects are not up to the standard kids have come to expect from movies nowadays, but they're passable, and the kids really did get into the story line and the characters."
1,Horrid,"Flashy effects with actors that are sleep walking through this UNINSPIRED re-telling of what should be a fascinating story. It's best to go buy/rent the 60's version of Jason and the Argonauts or, best yet, read the myth. You cant go wrong with the latter two options."
3,Mythological Fiction,"This was a better-than-average attempt to portray a mythological literary event on film. Not for the very young, as some disturbing violent scenes are present. I DO happen to like this genre of movie, however, even though hardly any of them would rate 5-stars in my humble opinion."
1,They slaughtered this movie,"The old one was twice as good. the story is so jumbled is even worse than my room. the one scene that i wanted to see the most the skeleton scene was so messed up i could not even tell they were skeletons he did a strange cicus act that made the skeletons hit each other with their weapons which was clearly a moronic attempt to look cool and save money. this movie reeks, and is not worth the money!"
2,"It'll enthrall kids and young teens, others will be bored.","Jason and the Argonauts is a watchable enough adventure film. It has all the makings of an epic: mostly impressive special effects, clashing sword battles, high adventure, and a three-hour length. But, unfortunately, it's never all that engaging or interesting. After a fine opening, the movie never really picks up momentum for an incredibly long time. That is, not until the last 35 minutes, which is really quite exciting, featuring monsters, sword fights, but there's not really much else to go on."
2,Not a dazzler - boring cast,The cast wasn't all that great. The acting was a bit weak like they couldn't get into their roles. The evil king (Jason's stepfather) one of the key characters was really poorly miscasted! That actor totally did not fit in and didn't have the accent to go with it either to make things worse so it killed authenticity to this story. It was just not as impressive as I thought it might be. For these movies you need big budget flair and mystical actors. If you want to see impressive under this genre check out Arabian Nights. Big difference.
3,Jason & the Argonauts-2000,"Wasnt overly impressed with the re-make. While true to story, it lacked punch for me."
2,Will Hollywood Ever Learn?,"OK, there is only one ""Psycho."" There is just one ""Gone with the Wind."" It would be foolish to improve on ""Casablanca."" Thus, there is only one ""Jason,"" and it was made in 1963 under the skilled craftmanship of the master animator Ray Harryhausen.Invest in that one and leave this one alone."
3,Way 2 Mainstreamish,"Mo Thug's Mothership is very mainstream sounding, unlike the other two. If you are going to get a Mo Thugs album deffinitly get the second one or the first instead."
