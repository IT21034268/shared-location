1,Good Condition??,"I ordered this book for one of my college classes and in all honesty this is the only book that was in the worse condition. Before I ordered this book, the condition stated that it was good. Now if other people consider good as water damaged, stained, and smelly then please ignore this review. Overall, I personally was not pleased with this purchase."
3,Extinction,If you are looking for a movie with some zombie action look elsewhere.This was a ok movie it wasn't bad nor was it super great I would watch it again. There was some good actor in the movie. I would say that this movie was above low buget so it's worth watching for $3 bucks. Three *** is about right.
2,Extinction,This movie was not very good. I almost fell asleep.I would only recommend this to one of the zombies in the movie.
2,Not enjoyable,"Slow, poorly acted, and weakly planned. An all around bad movie even by genre standards. The story line is stale as well."
2,"predictable story and acting, doesnt have that effect","predictable story and acting, doesnt have that effectspecially with tons of movies in this genre, this doesn't stand outThe girl is hot though...2 stars for her"
1,skip it,"I'm a huge fan of dystopic, zombie, horror and thriller flicks. I've watched countless movies via amazon thru the years as a prime member. This movie was boring, the cinematography stunk, and with about 15 minutes left I fell asleep. Oh yeah- I have never been so motivated to write a review. This is my first. A warning to you all!Avoid.-dukotix"
2,not very good,"I like zombie movies , even low budget movies but this one is slow, and the ending was just as slow. kind of like, drifting off into the sunset slow. but still better than the lesbian horror movie, W ( women )"
1,Just bad!!,My wife almost killed me for wasting my $$$$ on this. would of been better to just go to bed.
2,They needed some more zombies extras,"I think I seen the same zombies being killed in more than one scene. This movie is OK, but I don't think it is worth the money to see it, should be cheaper. It starts out OK, then gets kinda boring, then later starts to pick up some pace, but then loses it with some cheesy pyrotechnics and boring over dramatization."
1,Apocalypse Film Fanatic,"I have watched many, many low budget films simply because they were post-apocalyptic or scary, zombie fighting flicks. I honestly couldn't even make myself finish ""Extinction"". The gore is there if that's your thing, but the story was disjointed. It didn't make me care about any of the characters and I need at least that much. ""The Divide"", or ""Doomsday"" will in my opinion provide a much better experience for you."
1,"Katherine is a hero, NOT a villain!","Katherine Harris is a good, honest, God-fearing woman, who did exactly the right thing in the 2000 election, and this awful man should be deported for writing this book! It is bad enough to make fun of the Bush brothers like he does, but then to ridicule poor Katherine, too? It made me sick, to read it, just as it made me sick to read the liberal media's attempts to discredit the Bushes and Mrs. Harris over the last two years. I couldn't even finish it. Think about it: If not for Katherine Harris, Al Gore would be President today! Is that what anyone wants? Please do not buy this book and encourage this man. If you want to read a GOOD book, you should read Center of the Storm: Practicing Principled Leadership in Times of Crisis, by Katherine Harris."
5,Tricks of the Trade,This is exactly the video I was looking for! I learned all the basics of sushi making from the perfect sticky rice to the most incredible spicy sauce. Anyone can easily make sushi at home after watching this video. The rice-ball trick was very clever and makes sushi making so simple. My hand rolls and cut rolls are getting better each time I watch the tape. I highly recommend this tape to everyone! PS - The suggestions for hand roll fillings aren't just for kids.
2,non professional video,The way he make sushi not to detail to fast and very short time. And the dynamic sushi maker on the front of this video is making at home video quality and general non profesionalism. This could be make by camcoder....two stupid kids its really annoying me.
1,a waste of cash,"I received the exercise bike, put it together as soon as I got it, and started using it. Just looking at it I had second thoughts about buying it. Ten minutes later it broke. Some part in this cheaply made product broke on the inside. I contacted the guys who sold this to me to get my money back but they never got back to me.One more thing. Even if it hadn't broken, the resistance setting on this thing is horrible. You get absolutely no resistance on it. That means no workout."
3,Meh...,Should have gone with the heavier duty. At Most it can hold a Elinchrom Quadra head or an sb-600. SB-800 with the 5th battery made it sag down.
2,Arrived Damaged,"This product is billed as heirloom quality, yet it was not packaged well at all for shipping and it arrived damaged. I only plan on giving it as a gift for Christmas so I am hoping something can be done... but after contacting the seller, I didn't hear anything back from them, until I sent another e-mail. I was so looking forward to getting this item, but I have been left quite disappointed. (I rated 2 stars on all levels, but my child has not played with the toy yet as it is damaged, and I DON'T KNOW YET, wasn't an option)"
3,Wooden handles not aligned,"Our daughter received this from her g-ma as a birthday gift. Its a cute toy. She didn't play with it much up until a few weeks ago. Now that she's 18 months old she lives on it. I guess the defect of the handles being misaligned is a common one from what I've read. Also the music box which is concealed with velcro just below the trunk is easily removed by curious toddlers, exposing wires that aren't protected. Close supervision with this toy is necessary."
3,Elijah Elephant,"Overall I liked this toy but, definately do not ""love"" it. It is just as cute as the pictures. However, one of the ears on ours is folded forward and will not stand up. Also the music quality is horrible and the songs are a little weird (traditional childrens songs would be better). Finally, I would prefer if the handles were rounded (for safety)."
5,Autism in the school age child,Excellent Book for educating children on the spectrum. You will not find this information in other typical autism books.
5,The Best,"This is the best how to book for helping an autistic child with everyday life skills. Great format, easy to read and understand. The author has lived this and it shows in the writing and attention to details that are sometimes missed or forgotten when teaching an autistic child. A must read for those ""blessed"" with a child with autism."
5,Amazing & Powerful Women,"Helen Kooiman Hosier gave me the beautiful gift of enabling me to get to know and understand the hearts and genius of 100 Christian heroinesEvery person on the planet over 12 would benefit from reading this book. Imagine learning the stories of women whose names you have heard, but don't know where they came from, how they got to make a difference in our world, and why they made the choices they made.I was amazed at the deep faith of women heroines I never knew were Christians.Here is one example of a name that I have heard all my life: Florence Nightengale. One patient in a hospital said this of Florence Nightengale's impact on him as she made her nightly rounds with her lamp to light her way: ""What a comfort it was to see her pass even. She would speak to one, and nod and smile to as many more; but she could not do it all, you know. We lay there by hundreds; but, we could kiss her shadow as it fell and lay our heads on the pillow again content."""
3,Subjective Selection,"I have not read this book, but looked through the table of contents and was extremely surprised not to find my own Christian mentor, Elisabeth Elliot, was not one of the women covered. How could the author/editor of this book possibly NOT include such a well-respected, much-loved godly Christian woman as Mrs. Elliot Gren? Her writings, speaking engagements, and radio program, Gateway to Joy, have reached and touched millions of people all around the world, and I find it amazing that she should not be included in this book. E. Elliot is the widow of martyr Jim Elliot, and her book Shadow of the Almighty alone, in the ways it has led so many people to Christ, is enough of a contribution to merit her being one of the ""100 Christian Women Who Changed the 20th Century.""It is truly a shame Mrs. Elliot Gren was not written about in this book."
5,Love how it shows so many meaning to Aloha,I bought this book for my kids when they were little and now I'm getting it for my grandchildren. Love ths book!
4,Both Sides,"Both Sides being Collins 1993 and his 5th studio album was met with lukewarm critique and did not sell nearly as well as prior albums. For the first time Collins writes sleeve notes and he even writes this inside the book-let ""This is the first time I've ever written sleeve notes for one of my albums"". Instead of collaborating with people like Hugh Padgham, he prouced and played all the instruments himself. Everyday is a tremendous love song that deals with the immense feelings that comes with love. The book-let is sparse but is still filled with all lyrics. The photo on the cover has Collins looking quite pensive and on the back he is smiling which perfectly fits the title. 4/5."
4,Better with time,"On the first listen, i got bored, there were to many slow songs, now though after a few listens, the music becomes more appreciated. Some of his best work is on this album. Stand out tracks would have to be 'Both Sides Of The Story' 'We Wait & We Wonder' 'Everyday' 'Cant Turn Back The Years' 'We Fly So Close' & 'Please Come Out Tonight. A definite for any fanalso recommend:TESTIFY-Phil CollinsUP-Peter GabrielSECONDS OUT LIVE-GenesisSTRIPPED-Christina Aguilera"
2,EASY.....EASY.......TOO EASY,"Ok, I fall in love with Phil's music 10-12 years ago and he is the pop-disco star from 80'es, but not the music star from 90'es. This album isn't terrible at all, but like someone said it's too private. It deserves max 2 and 1/2 stars. ""Everyday"" is great song, ""Both sides of story"" is ok, but after third song, album goes to nowhere. It is like you open big book and inside there isn't any word. Every song is too long (more than 6 minutes) and I really can't listen this album 'cause it become really painful after some time. The songs has some mood, that is true, but there isn't any catchy melody, only easy going to nowhere. This album isn't disaster but after his previous classic ""...but seriously"" this is big step down and this sounds like he is tired from life and everything. Too easy...only for big fans."
5,The best of the best,"This and No Jacket Required are the best Phil's done. We've got emotional, breakup-ish songs (Can't Turn Back The Years), love songs (Everyday), songs about problems in society (We're Sons Of Our Fathers), and songs with that nice bit of sexual innudeo (Please Come Out Tonight). Well what are you waiting for?"
5,Phil's done it again!,"Both Sides was the first album that I ever bought, and definetly one of the best. It was amazing how Phil Collins performed & produced all of the songs. I bought the album mostly because of the song ""Everyday"" which I'd heard on the radio several times. I soon found out that there were many more great songs included; Both Sides of the Story was fantastic. At the time I didn't enjoy Please Come Out Tonight, but now it's one of my favorite love songs."
3,"Okay, but too depressing","This is not a bad album--not at all. It's just a little slow and a little depressing. ""Both Sides Of The Story"" is a nice song, but haven't we heard enough on the topic of the less fortunate from Phil both solo and with Genesis (""Man On The Corner"", ""Another Day In Paradise"", ""Tell Me Why"")? ""Everyday"" is a sweet hit, and ""Can't Find My Way"" is an interestingly moody song. None of the songs on here are terrible; but to me the mood is just too somber. Combining this with an overall lack of catchy tunes makes this a little short of Phil's previous efforts. Still a good enough effort to call 3 1/2 stars overall."
4,Both Sides Of The Storyteller,"Although Phil Collins popularity fizzled in the 1990's, his music remained as fresh and intimate as usual. His 1993 album Both Sides, reflects about holding on to love, and remembering the good and bad times with others, as well as breaking up with your partner. The songs are very sincere and compassionate. Each song has an story to tell. The first song Both Sides Of The Story, about an homeless child trying to get ahead in life (similar to Collins megahit Another Day In Paradise).From D-I-V-O-R-C-E, to his split with Genesis, Both Sides forcasted the stories of Phil Collins in the 1990's. But everyday, something good will come along if you think positive. I really thought it was one of the most understanding albums I've ever heard. We always gander at one side of the story of each problem, but Both Sides shows that every side, Everyday (as in the song titled Everyday) we all go through life on more than one street. Both Sides states that constant."
5,Great For Those Dark Moods,"I love this album...it is by far one of my favorite Phil albums. It definitely has a dark undertone like his earlier work in In The Air Tonight and I Don't Care Anymore. But sometimes, you need to hear that kind of music when your sad and/or mad and it does give some balance to some of Phil's mushily sweet love songs.The best two songs on the album, by far, are We Fly So Close and I Can't Find My Way. Both make you want to just reach into the stereo and help that man find his way home.I don't care what the critics say, Phil, I loved it and I would highly recommend it to others."
1,Waste of time,"Phil Collins may play every instrument on this album but do not be fooled, he will never play as many instruments or play them as well as his serious competators in the music world (notably Peter Gabriel) and hes still a weak vocalist and songwriter. Both Sides is an album with simple non real talent musical accompaniment and bland songs."
2,Wrong Edition,"I was sent the wrong edition. It is rather annoying because I am missing some of the information. The picture shown is the second edition so that is what I thought I would be getting, however it was labeled wrong and I was sent the first edition."
1,I hate highlighting!,"The book I believe was said to be clean. However, there were stickers and dirty smudges all over the cover. Inside there was quite a bit of highlighting, that I did not expect. It is readable, but I felt the description I received from the used bookstore was less than accurate."
2,CHOOSY SHOPPER SUCKS..,VERY UNPROFESSIONAL CALLED THEM UP FOR GREEN TIE WAITED 4 WEEKS ONLY TO LET ME KNOW THEY NEVER SENT IT. TERRIBLE. I WENT TO HOLLYWOOD TO SAVE TIME AND FOUND IT. SO THERE.. WHAT FOOLS.
1,low quality,"This tie is not of a top quality silk tie, it's like paper thin. I could not believe how light wieght the tie was. The color was awsome but if you are looking for a nice silk quality tie this is not the one."
5,accidents happen,"This pan is not for those who have the skill and patience to assemble a true topsy turvy cake. For the rest of us this is the perfect ""oops"" pan for our attempts at cake baking. Think a Dr. Seuss-themed birthday party. Use this pan to bake the base for a tipsy cake. Wilton has included detailed directions (such as using solid vegetable shortening and flour to prepare the pan)for use. Size is roughly eleven inches from top to base and ten inches across at base. According to Wilton this is equivalent to a two layer cake mix."
2,Not so good,"This was a little of a deception, is smaller than I thinked about it, and its really difficult to bake it because it tumbles in oven. The resulting cake is very small."
2,Deceptive Product,"Ugh - the title of this product is very deceptive. One would expect a pan (or set of pans) to make a true topsy-turvy cake - usually three tiers high. This pan makes a poor, poor substitute for a topsy-turvy cake. I would much prefer a traditional cake pan to this sad excuse. Wilton usually makes great products - why are they putting their brand name on this?"
2,THOMAS FOR MY NEPHEW... LEARNING HOW TO TELL TIME,I thought this clock was made out of better materials. It's not! Very cheaply made. I bought it because I thought it had quality written all over it.
1,A Waste,"At our suggestion, we received this as a gift for our six year old, who wanted an alarm clock. The clock is adorable, but so poorly constructed that the alarm failed right out of the box. Amazon does itself and its customers a disservice by selling a product as poorly made as this."
1,Poor quality,We've bought this clock for our 5 year old son. The next day alarm stopped working. Wouldn't recommend buying it.
4,Could be a possible reality sooner than we know.,"This book had me from the beggining. I am a gadget and technology guru, so this book really hit home. I did find though that the book started loosing interest about 3/4 of the way through. Then it picked up again.The ending was ok but definately could have been better.Still an excellant book to read. I would recommend this book to anyone."
1,Immature and poorly written,"This is without doubt the worst book I have read this year. It is poorly constructed, ill thought out and just plain poor science. The characters are shallow and cliche, after boring clieche page upon page is presented you by an author who can barely write. This is sci-fi for ten year olds written by a ten year old. Do not waste your money."
3,i swear,"I listened to the preview of the song ""I Swear"", and it was pretty good. I would like it if you could start at the beginning of the song and play it for say, 45 seconds? just my opinion."
2,PLEASENT BUT BLAND,"BRADOKA's musik washes over you and is immediately forgotten. The melodies are predictable and naiv at times. The guitar playing is average, but no more than that. Not one solo stands out and makes you sit up and listen, neither do the compositions.The production is slick but boring without any high or low points. There is no apparent energy or enthusiasm transmitted to the listener by the musik or the playing. No chances are ever taken and everything sounds contrived and stillted.P.S. It is also barely 35 mins long. This was OK on vinyl in the 60's or 70's, but with a 74 mins. capacity this is very poor value."
3,ehh not what i expected,"Flimsy build, but suited well for universal use. Lights are pretty dim, even the brights. Its LEGAL to ride at night with these but I definitely don't like to unless its all lit with street lights. They are a bit shakey too :/ Might try some modifying with them in the future as I do like the look of them."
1,"Written by statisticians for statisticians, not under grads",Positive aspects: Many examples for practice.Negative aspects: Definition of terms are too complex and require further explanation. Most definition of terms refer to terms defined in previous chapters. This causes far too much searching and flipping through pages looking for previously defined terms. Guaranteed headache in 2.5 minutes.Recommendation: Only read if you are a hard core statistician. I had to suffer through this book only because it was required reading for an undergraduate statistics class at the university I attend. My classmates and I have asked our instuctor to never use this book again for an undergraduate level class. Ten editions and they still can't get it right!
3,Edition,Does anyone know if the 15e has changed drastically since the 11e... a huge price difference.. not sure if its worth the risk! anyone know??
3,Statistical Techniques in Business and Economics with CD-Rom,The book I received did not have the cd the book was in used condition not good as stated. It was ok. It would have been nice to have the cd. It needs to be a little more detailed.
4,wonderful plus size romance...,"I am not normally a contempoary romance reader. This book was suggested to me on a list of plus sized heroines. This is wonderful book. The hero and heroine are real people-with real jobs and real problems. I liked how the author showed that even though the hero was ""perfect"" physically, he was also filled with self doubt about himself-and Lucy was just as bad about judging him by his looks as others were to her. Lucy is a heroine to love-a delightful blend of self doubt and optimism.Yes-there are parts that are a bit cliche'-but those are present in most romances and do NOT take away from the story one bit.If you like to root for the underdog then you'll enjoy this fun, emotional, and sensuous romance:)4 stars!"
3,A nice & sweet story,"This was a sweet contemporary romance story, where you really get to see the characters develop. It was just a little to weight focused for my taste, to be fair I had warning of that going in."
3,Meh - problematic in multiple ways,"I'm mainly giving this book 3 stars because it is so poorly edited that it was actually a little difficult to read at times. The male lead is a bit too good and there's the icky inference that a woman has to be an acceptable weight to find love. But I did actually find the relationship believable and it was marginally better that the emphasis was on physical fitness, not being a size zero. The best part of the book is how Donovan portrays the main characters body shame from dealing with a teenage trauma - the way it suddenly pops up seemingly inexplicably as these things do. Otherwise, the novel is totally unexceptional."
3,Good but didn't draw me in,"I liked this book. Just not a lot. There was nothing to dislike, it just didn't grab my attention. It's a fun romance and I would read other books by Susan Donovan but I didn't love it."
2,Not As Good As Her Others,"I really enjoyed this author's previous works (especially 'Knock Me Off My Feet', which is outstanding). This was a ho-hum, run-of-the-mill romance novel. I never really cared about the characters or, for that matter, even really got a good mental image of then. It seemed a forced story with almost gratuitous inclusion of the Special Olympics side story. On to find a new favorite author..."
3,So-So Romance,"Light, fun summer beach read. Don't read it after just reading the new Harry Potter book or a Kingsolver novel!"
4,4 and 1/2 stars,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was soooo entertaining. It had good dialogue, great characters, great story and some sizzle. It would have received a 5 star rating with a little more sizzle."
4,Good little book!,I thought this was a good book. Kept me interested the whole time. I'd like to read another book by this author also.
5,Laugh out loud funny!,I don't think I have ever laughed so hard while reading a book. It was hilarious throughout the entire book. I loved Lucy's sarcasm and quick wit - even when she was large. I completely related with her self esteem issues when it came to her body. I think anyone who has ever been overweight (whether it be 20lbs or a 100lbs) would be able to relate to what she was going through. Watching her relationship with Theo change was definitely a pleasure to read. I wish Ms. Donovan would write a story about one of the secondary characters so maybe we could get a glimpse of Theo and Lucy now. I really can't say enough about this book! I will most likely go out and buy it (I borrowed it from the library) so I can have it on standby when I have a really bad day.
4,Cute!!,"He Loves Lucy is a story about an overweight woman named Lucy who gets an offer to lose a 100 pounds within a year and she'll receive money for each pound she loses. Theo, the beautiful trainer, ends up helping her and of course Lucy falls in love with him. He in return over time starts to have feelings for her, but fears and life seem to keep them apart.The story overall was cute and heartwarming. Both Lucy and Theo are good people and try to help others around them. Buddy was a fun character, but the other characters in the book weren't given great dept which is fine since the book mostly surrounds Lucy and Theo.Although I predicted the ending before I even started reading it, it was fun to read about what happens between the two of them and read about the transformation Lucy makes. It read at a pretty quick pace and keeps you wondering if Lucy is going to make her goal."
2,Information is not correct on this item,States that it has a removable plastic tray for knive storage.Twice this has been sent to me minus the white plastic insert.Image is correct as it does not show case with the white tray but description is mis-leading
2,16 Slots Removable Knife Tray Not 25,"This bag was described as having 25 knife slots. In fact it has 16. Other than that, it's described here correctly. I've seen other descriptions of the same bag, stating that there are 2 removable trays. It has one removable tray."
4,Good Product Good price,"Over the years I have had many tire gauges, but this one beats them all. I hope to have this for a long time. The air bleed feature is nice."
4,air guage,"I like the air guage however, i had to replace the batteries one week after receiving the guage. I called the mfr. and they asked me to look at the back of the guage and read them the codes. They said the guage was two years old. Three batteries cost me ten dollars. I think Amazon should tell you they bought old inventory."
2,Difficult to use it and not accurate!,"I returned mine to Amazon. Didn't like it for the price I paid for. It was not giving me accurate readings. The readings on the tire 32.5 psi first reading. 20 seconds later, the same tire gives me 31.6 psi."
5,as advertised,"YOUR PRODUCT WAS AS ADVERTISED AND ARRIVED NEARLY IMMEDIATELY AFTER ORDERING. SUCH A GOOD FEELING TO GET ECELLENT SERVICE THESE DAYS.FRANK N ARIHOODLAFAYETTE, IN"
2,Doesn't work in cold weather,"It appears that the problem of slow readings described in the earlier reviews has been solved, as my gauge reads continuously. The reading drops several psi while bleeding just as with a mechanical dial gauge. The reading takes about two seconds to re-stabilize, so a mechanical gauge is actually faster to use.The quick-connector on the end of the hose is excellent, but be careful to not scratch the wheel with it. The hose is fairly stiff, but isn't a problem most of the time.I used this gauge at the track this past weekend, and was pleased with it until the second morning when it was cold (by cold I mean 45F, this is Houston...) and the display read 'Lo', indicating a low battery. So essentially the gauge was useless. The hose also becomes annoyingly stiff when cold.Overall, a good mechanical gauge is easier to use and more reliable, as long as you don't drop it."
2,"Good Gauge, but CHEAP, LEAKY FiTTINGS","If this gauge cost $20 I would give it a high rating, but even at the discounted $35 price I see for these gauges I think it is bad value, let alone the nearly $50 it cost me!AS mentioned hose is VERY INFLEXIBLE at cool, not just cold temps, general quality of the fittings is very poor for something advertised like this, mine is now leaking badly and I am trying to repair with quality materials, as I still hope to use the gauge part anyway.I would NOT BUY AGAIN!"
1,Defective,Unfortunately the unit received was defective. It leaked from inside the dial to the point I could not get a pressure reading. It was returned for a credit.
1,More Problems With This Product,"Problems that I have encountered with this gauge:1 - Hose is too stiff. Storing it in its case doesn't help straightening it out either.2 - The Gauge doesn't work in cold weather when taking readings during the winter months.3 - The lever on the chuck that locks the hose to the valve stem literally fell apart.3 - Good luck finding the recommended replacement batteries.The only positive thing I have to say about this product is that the chuck is deeper than on most othe tire gauges which is a plus. But the extremely stiff hose negates this advantage.Don't waste your money on this product. I replaced it with a similar gauge made by Slime and that gauge has more functions built into it than this one and it has a much more flexible hose and replacement batteries are readily available for it. And its less than half the cost of this one. BTW this is another ""Made in China"" piece of junk."
1,Accutire MS-5510B Racing Tire Gauge is not accurate,"This gauge does not remain accurate for very long, if it ever was. I finally switched to Longacre Racing's digital tire pressure gauge and couldn't be happier! Look to Longacre Racing for accuaracy down .3%, better than anything else I could find."
1,Not recommended,"I just received the gauge and I'm returning it after trying it for 2 minutes:- The hose didn't seal well on the tire valve- WHen bleeding air, the display didn't update. You have to remove the hose, wait 10 seconds for the display to turn off, then plug it back to the valve stem and get a reading. This is ridiculous.- The display is on for 10 seconds and then it turns off itself"
3,"Looks cool , seems to be accurate",The other poster is correct you cannot bleed the tire and get a reading while the air is escaping however the display resets at 10 seconds so you can bleed the tire then hit the recall button and it will take a new reading while still connected. the instruction book is very skimpy and does not cover much... like all you have to do is clear the bleed valve and insert the cable and it will automatically take the reading. I also didn't understand the calibration part of the instruction manual.....
4,accutire,I like it!! seems hard to find pressure gauge that reads at 3 psi for Quad tires. This one is 0-60!! great!! No problems using gauge once you are familiar with it. I also like the bright display. I gave one star less for the stiff hose.
2,BATTERY LIFE IS THE WORST,As stated in previous reviews. This item would get 4-5 stars except thebattery life is unexceptably low. I only checked by tires a dozen timesbefore low battery signal comes on. And those watch batteries that ittakes are super expensive!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Excellent Gauge - Poor Connection,"This is an excellent gauge. The valve stem connection is leaky and seems to damage the thread of the valve stem. It is accurate to +/- 0.5psi with 0.1psi readout resolution. Digital display is clear, also measures to Bar scale."
2,Very Disappointed!,"The gauge looks good, but the o-ring on the sqivel leaks air and clamp on the end of the hose was hard to use without leaking air out. Others love it, I hate it. I went back to my old tire gauge, and will give this on to Goodwill!"
5,Quality~!,I love this tire pressure gauge! Super accurate and very well designed! Well worth the money!
2,Disappointed,"Upon receipt of the tire gauge I was pleased with the large display and size of the item. When I applied the gauge to a valve stem it wouldn't seal and air continued to leak out. I applied it to three of my other vehicle valve stems and the same leakage occurred. I returned the gauge for a refund. Note: By the way, the Amazon return process is no hassel. The Amazon representative provided me excellent service."
2,"Looks good,but not impressed!","I just got it today. Opened the package and saw a small screw laying in the the plastic wrapper. Looked at gauge...screw was missing from back of main body and appeared to be one of the 2 retainer screws that hold the bleeder tube(round tube with air bleed off button) to main body. I then used it one first tire and noticed it would loose air pressure quickly when when removed(not from using bleed off botton. I found that the rubber hose was loose where it screws into the bleeder tube. The guage works reasonally well,but not great. LOOK if the manufacturer is too lazy to put all the screws in and tighten everything...then that makes me a bit nervous about the quality/accuracy of the guage(I will check it against a mechanical guage later). Look its $35 and MADE IN CHINA...don't expect the world(""worlds most accurate guage"" is B.S.). I won a $25 gift card so it only cost me $10. Satisfied,but would shop around more before buying another!"
3,Accurate but flawed,Love the accuracy of this gauge but its a bit quirky to handle especially since the valve stem clip never holds the way it should. Ive been an automotive tech for a long time and Ive seen these same style clips on the cheep chinese pressure gauges and they didnt work well on those either. Other than that its a nice gauge but not very ergonomic. You just about have to hold it in your right hand and hold the clip end on the valve stem so it doesnt leak. Kind of defeats the purpose of having a clip there.
4,Tire guage,Nice product..sometimes you need to do a few repeats to get an accurate reading because the clip doesn't hold on to the stem
4,"At Last, An accurate tire gauge","Service on getting the item was ""JUST OK"". Also there was no ""Free Shipping"". That is why I only gave it 4 Stars. The gauge is accurate, and I find it easy to use. I had no problems getting the gauge onto the tire stem as some of the reviewers indicated. I wanted a gauge that gave me resolution down to .1 lbs, and this one does. As some of the other reviewers stated, the hose on the gauge is a bit stiff. Overall, I am happy with my purchase. I would recommend it to a friend."
4,Takes Some Getting Used To,"Nice gauge -- comes with a zipper carrying pouch. Using the gauge takes a bit of practice because the hose flops around -- it's definitely a two-hand operation. Once the gauge is firmly clipped to the tire stem, however, getting very accurate inflation pressures is simply a matter of using the bleed valve to slowly reduce the tire pressure to exactly what you want (assuming you slightly over-inflated the tire to begin with). Personally, I would have preferred a rigid connector to the tire as opposed to the flexible hose. And, don't depress the ON-OFF button too long because that causes the gauge to switch between psi and BAR. Now that I have this gauge I'm thinking: do I really need to know my tires' pressures to an accuracy of 0.1 psi? Think about it before buying -- I should have."
1,Not so Good,"I read that many people have had problems with this gauge but I took a chance and ordered it. ""Mistake"",Gauge leaked. Wouldn't hold or take a reading. Returned it for refund. Look else where!!"
1,Quality leaves something to be desired,"Ordered this on sale from Amazon. When I opened the blister package, the air release button and spring fell out. Gauge was defective before I could even try it out. Sent it back for a replacement. We'll see how that goes.Postscript:I got the replace and the gauge works fine, but for some odd reason they put the stiffest hose I have ever seen on this gauge. I give it two starts as the cheap, stiff hose makes it quite awkward to use. If it had a higher quality hose on it, I would give it four stars."
5,The best tire gauge I've ever owned.,"I've owned a lot of tire gauges through the years, including some expensive racing and sports car specialty gauges. This is the best one I've ever owned. The accuracy, down to a 1/10th of a pound, the leak-free connector, and the back-lighted dial are three of the best features. Now that I've bought if, I can't imagine having any other tire gauge."
1,Unreliable,"The gage was fine for a few days, I didn't use it too much and then it went dead. I replaced the batteries thinking they were dead and the gage still didn't work. I live in South America and shipping it back would be too expensive so I just gave up on it. It is not a reliable gage, at least mine was not."
2,f1faniam,"well built, easy to read display. bleeder feature is handy.the bad..leaks easily if not ""centered"" re: little floating metal attachment in the head, i assume to lock on the valve stem.also display fluctuates by .1-.5 until settles on a reading.thought would be a quality gage but due to time consuming issues above would not recommend."
4,Great Gauge,"This gauge has been wonderful. I purchased it because of the need for a highly accurate gauge and this boasted a 0.1 PSI accuracy - the best I could find. It has lived with all of my automotive equipment for almost four years, being jostled around in a difficult tool environment. Today, it finally sprung a small leak and I noticed the tire connection point was just slightly bent. I've always wished that piece was a little sturdier and, in generally, that the gauge was a little less finicky as far as its position, but it has been an absolutely wonderful gauge. I'm now looking to purchase a new gauge and the only reason I'm going to shop around instead of simply buying a new one of these is that I want to make sure something new hasn't come out. I wouldn't be at all surprised if I end up owning another one of these for the next four years and won't be at all disappointed with the purchase."
1,do not buy,After returning 2 of these Accurtire gauges I give up. The first came apart at the gauge end and the second blew off the nozzle end. Both times parts were lost so I couldn't fix them. With the third gauge after tightning the ends. the analog reads right but the digital reads about 1/10 of the correct reading. So the choice is risk losing parts by not tightening or having inaccurate readings. Best choice is not buying.
5,Brilliant Tyre Gauge,"This is an amazing quality product for such a small price. it is extremely fast at reading the pressure, easy to let the pressure down then it via the bleed button and then shows pressure level again.the display is large and very easy to read - perfect for when your dealing with tyre pressures in the dark or dim light.this is by far the best gauge on the market - the batteries are very easy to change when they go flat.I wouldnt go past this gauge for any other.I had the gauge shipped to Australia and it arrived in 7 days :-)"
1,Accutire MS-5510B Racing Tire Guage,"I am not all that happy with this guage. when it gets cold it does not work. at 1st I thought it had some how got stuck in on position or just a lousy battery life. after it had warmed up again, I pressed the on button and what do you know it was working again. I will not recommend guage."
1,Very disappointed.,"VERY, VERY disappointed with this gauge. When I first received it, the gauge wouldn't turn on. I took out the batteries and reinstalled, then the unit came on. I then checked my tire pressure and the gauge read over 70 pounds all around. The tires felt very hard, so I trusted the gauge. After I did this, my pressure monitor warning light came on. I went to the dealership who checked the pressures only to find that I had between 15 and 17 pounds all of the way around. Thankfully, I only drove less than one day like this. Could have very easily destroyed $1300 worth (wholesale) of tires.Absolutely will not recommend to anyone. Sorry guys. Your gauges, or at least your quality assurance blows wind."
1,horrible reliability,"I'm on my second one in less than 8 months, and it just went. First one was replaced under warranty, but I think I'll just give up at this point. Both have had the same failure mode - air leak in the body of the guage."
1,same problems here,"As other reviewers mentioned, the display does not update when using the bleed valve and you have to wait at least 10 seconds between readings. It may be accurate, but dropping overpressure tires to a desired level ends up being a several-minute guessing and waiting game. Calling it a ""racing"" gauge is ridiculous."
1,Junk Food for the Mind,"When I walked past this book in the store, it caught my eye. Like so many people, I have problems with my weight - and with my relationships. A couple of years ago I read Gary Smalley's ""The Five Love Languages"" and found it to be very sensible and helpful. So, based on my respect for Gary Smalley's name, I bought the book. Well... I was very dissappointed. After wading through the first 30 pages of fluff, I began to get the the ""meat"" of the matter and found it to be just a jumble of unscientific, unsubstantiated diet cliches.Now, I have no evidence of this, but I suspect that this book was concieved by the publisher, written by somebody else (which Dr. Smalley admits), and published under Smalley's well-respected name to boost it's sales. Just the title alone puts it into two genera which generally sell well. Many may buy it, but I suspect that few will find it useful."
4,SPSS- Beyond just Statistics,"Hi Friends, I was introduced to SPSS package during my MBA in Agri-business at MANAGE Institute-Hyderabad, India.And I was amazed with its capabilities. It can do wonders for any organization. And the book which I'm writing about just helps you to master necessary skills. But before you open the book or SPSS software, I strongly recommend you to brush up with concepts of Statistics and more importantly which tool is best for analysis. This avoids confusion in interpreting the output.My suggestion to SPSS Inc., would be to include student version of SPSS Base free of cost to increase it's popularity. This software is not used efficiently by several organisations. The real power of SPSS lies in Syntax reference. So next time you open SPSS be prepared to explore as much as you can. wirte your queries and opinions to me at gopinathkoneti@yahoo.com"
4,Well Done-Great Nostalgia,"I remember listening to this game with my late father-in-law. I had followed that Yale team all season and couldn't believe the startling collapse in the last few minutes. He was a Harvard fan, though softspoken about it. He obviously enjoyed my every wince as Harvard charged back from near certain defeat. The player interviews along with actual game films were nicely spliced together to produce a fine film."
5,The Best on Meditation,"John Main writings are helpful in understanding how to access the Spirit of God through meditation. In thishelpful writing he explains ""how"" to meditate or contemplate, as well as explaining in depth its value and richness. Anyonewho wishes to understand prayer in a different light, that it is more than the repetition of words, will find this very helpful."
4,perfect for porc taco!,"I love this spice mix for my pork tacos: line a crockpot with banana leaves, pop in a pork shoulder (skin removed), pour over 100g Yucateco anchiote mixed with 1/2 cup lime juice and a sliced onion. Cook on high for 6 hours, turn to low til ready to use. Pull meat off into corn tortillas with a bit of the sauce (which can be thickened with yucca) and pickled cabbage-- YUM! I reuse old jars (jam, pickle, mayonnaise)to store the unused spice."
4,Great in recipes,Bought this to try it out and it is great in the recipes we have made. Only drawback is size becausw would have liked it larger!
4,El Yucateco Achiote Red Paste,"My knowledge of the Mexican kitchen is mostly limited to that of the D.F. and state of Mexico so we didn't use achiote all that much. The Yucatan and Quintana Roo produce some delicious dishes and I was curious to try to make some of them, myself. This achiote paste produced just the right color but I found it a bit difficult to get it to dissolve in oil, even with heat and constant stirring. Next time I think I'll try using the actual seeds instead (also available from a supplier to Amazon). I may be wrong but I think achiote is more of a colorante than a saborizante anyway."
3,Not bad,"This is a pretty decent album from a relatively unknown group. Sounds similar to Depeche Mode and New Order. Some of the patterns used in the tunes are a bit repetitive and mechanical at times, but I didn't notice right away. I like that the lyrics are somewhat vague. It gives me the chance to formulate what I want the song to be about as opposed to it being shoved down my throat. I'd be interested to see how they could pull off a live performance..."
3,As the cover art implies...,"It's not very helpful if you're searching for an objective text to read, and if you're a beginner it's even less recommended. As for many pro-Greece authors achievements of Oriental nations are recounted with a reluctant and mildly sarcastic tone, and it might make a careful reader doubt it's written and arranged only to be informative."
3,"Decent inverter, but ...","Pros: very compact and portable; able to usually power my HP laptop; long'ish power cord; easy to use.Cons: 1) It has a little cooling fan that is slightly noisy and runs almost continuously. Highway road noise mostly masks the noise. 2) Sometimes the inverter would blink a red light and temporarily suspend power output. Maybe it was too hot powering my HP laptop. According to kill-o-watt, my laptop usually draws only about 25 watts, or about 40 watts when also recharging the battery. 3) It sometimes smells a little bit like burnt plastic.Overall, I am satisfied with this inverter for the money spent. If I had to buy another, I'd probably get something with a little more power. However, my Honda Civic has a limit of 120 watts for DC accessories. The 175 watt inverter I used to have blew the fuse. Check your auto owner's manual for the power limit before you buy."
3,Beware!!! What you see may not be what you get!,"I purchased a Xantrex Pocket Powerpack 100 which consisted of a battery pack and an inverter for $69.99 from Amazon in November 2006. You could also buy a Xantrex Pocket Inverter 100 which is probably the identical inverter with a cord and lighter plug. Amazon sells this now directly for $25.58. Looking at the picture above you can read Pocket Inverter 100. The base unit is the battery pack for the Pocket Powerpack 100. Looks like someone removed the power cord from the Pocket Inverter 100, plopped it down on the battery pack and took a picture. The description of the item under Technical Details is correct.The inverter runs hot, but it works well. At least this is true using the battery pack (the one you may not get)."
5,Works just fine...,"Pros: charges cell phones, laptop (15"" LCD), Nintendo DS, PSP, Digital Cameras (USB) and other small stuff just fine without noisy fans (not sure what that other reviewer is hearing) or blown fuses. USB charging port for USB devices.Cons: not sure if it will handle higher current devices like large laptops, but I haven't tried.NOTE: I think this has a peak power rating of 100W but my previous Xantrex unit that is identical in appearance to this one is rate 175W peak power (bought 3-4 years ago).I've had no problems with either of my Xantrex Inverters with either functionality or noise."
5,Might surpass Original,"The cast is terrific, the look is genuine & dazzling, and the storyline true to the Dallas world; the best!"
5,J.R. Ewing is ICONIC!,I've watched this show back in the 80's and my favorite has always been J.R. Ewing and seeing him in this new series just reminds me why I love him and with his snappy comments just makes me smile and laugh.
5,It's Just Great!!!,"When a show you've loved since you were growing up returns, there's reason to be nervous. So many TV revivals have been mere shells of the original. Kudos to TNT for really getting this right. The emphasis, as in the original, is on the family dynamics, whether Ewing or Barnes. Great to see Larry Hagman (TV's all-time greatest villain), Linda Gray, Patrick Duffy and Ken Kercheval (as well as several others) back in their original roles, and great to see them key to the new plotlines. The dynamics among the younger generation have clear echoes to the original Dallas at its heights.Well done, TNT, keep it up in Season 2!! It will be bittersweet to watch Season 2 with Larry Hagman's recent passing, but his memory will live on in the show."
5,Cliff Barnes return,"This episode shows the return of Cliff Barnes, JR's long-time business rival, in the new series. It is great how the producers have weaved all the exciting aspects of the original in this continuation."
5,Dallas 2012,"Wasn't sure It would be what the First series Dallas was but, I was so surprised with the new Cast They turned out to be Great! My friends and Family Can't wait for the new series to begin on The 28th of Jan. 2013. JR will be missed and it want be the same without him but, He would love to see his Show Go on even without his presence it will be just as Great as Before! ""Dallas"" the Best show on TV."
5,Great show!,"I didn't get to watch dallas when it aired in the 80's, having been born in 1979 myself. However, I had grown up hearing about ""Who shot JR?"" so I knew about the show. Watching this new dallas had prompted me to want to watch the old dallas. The new dallas is just as good as the old one was, with all the plotting, scheming, and back biting. Looking foward to getting this on DVD & really looking forward to season 2! And for those who haven't seen it, JR really is a guy you love & hate @ the same time!!!!"
3,guess no one liked it,no more shows yet so what next now jr is gone we will never see the same crew againthe wife will miss them
1,you can have this one. i will keep the original,"I have been a Dallas fan my entire life. I was devistated when the series ended 20 years ago. I was so excited when they announced Dallas was coming back! And the original cast like linda gray, patrick duffy and larry hagman were returning as well. Little did i know the modern rewritten CRAP they ended up producing! The sets are hideously ugly, the new actors are terrible and feel like they are reading a script. The entire show lacks the suspense, drama and glamour of the original. Lets face it if not for the original actors coming back, the network would have pulled the plug before the pilot finished airing. I still hold that Dallas ended in 1991 because this modern piece of crap doesnt deserve to share the spot in tv history with the original."
1,More like Melrose Place than Dallas.,"As someone who owns the past 14 seasons of Dallas on DVD, a HUGE problem with the new Dallas is that it doesn't ""feel"" even remotely like the ""old"" Dallas. Unfortunately, it feels like 10 bad episodes of Melrose Place instead. I don't care for the writing or the casting. Aside from Linda Gray, the original cast look really, really old, which is disappointing. I can't help but feel that they should have left Dallas alone."
1,i hate it!!!,"yesterday i saw ""new dallas"", what bullshit!how many tv-series are they going to remake?""new"" melrose place cancelled after 1 season""new"" knight rider cancelled after 1 season""new"" v, cancelled after 2 seasonswhat now?a remake of dynasty? or the colby's? or falcon crest? or knots landing?stay off wonderfull classic shows!!!the only exception is the new doctor who series, that is even better then classic doctor who!!!"
5,Dallas: The Complete First Season,"I must agree with Patrick Duffy that the writing is seamless. They managed to pick up where the old series left off in a believable and intriguing plot. In addition, the new characters certainly can carry the weight of the new show. With the death of Larry Hagman, it was almost impossible to imagine Dallas without him, but in retrospect, I believe the John Ross character and actor will keep it going. He seems more transparent than JR I guess the archetype of good vs evil keeps this show popular."
4,JR is spectacular,JR is as ruthless as ever. Would have liked more Sue Ellen and JR scenes but it is a good show and season. Even Cliff is back. JR's son John Ross is great and hot and sexy too. If you're a Dallas fan your collection is not complete w/o it.
4,the new dallas,"i liked the new dallas was not sure how it would be but to my suprise it was very good,"
4,RIP Larry Hagman,"the return of Dallas was good and it worked, a good balance of the past and present. it says something about a popular show from the past being able to reinvent itself and making itself modern. the show had the back handed schemes and also alot of intriquing situations. dallas is one of the greatest shows ever and JR Ewing is a true iconic character and will never be forgotten. the return is good."
5,MUST HEAR!,"This long-anticipated follow up to The Poet Tree is Tracey's best work yet. Tracey's original music and lyrics take you on a journey that is at times soulful, at times spiritual. Her vocal range leaves you breathless and each piece leaves you anticipating the next.Lights BLAZES!"
4,Good plain sweatshirt,It's a good plain sweatshirt. No issues. I cut them up an make jackets. They are made from good material. The stitching is ok.
5,solid mp3 player,- love the size and weight.- great for the price.- have to go through menus to get to the Hold option.- not as sexy as the ipod nano.conclusion: a solid mp3 player
1,Dead After 1 Week,"Won't power-up, reset doesn't work and not even detected by a cpu. Sending this piece of sh%t back to Amazon for a refund.DO NOT BUY IT!!"
1,OH MY GOD,"Within 1 day of owning the product the thing broke. I spent ages looking at this player, comparing it to the new sony walkman and decided that this beats it. Mainly on size, price and software. I have to take it back tommorow which sucks.I plugged the thing in for three hours and came back to find that the charger was not working, THEN, thought oh well at least i can charge it through my computer which i did, but later after turning the thing on again and just listening to it for five minutes turned it off again, i mean surely a 130 mp3 player could handle this, but obviousley not as i can not turn it back on again!!! It wont turn on, charge or anything. The dam thing has broken and im so annoyed."
5,Wonderful writing but........,"A wonderful epic read beautifully by James Drury. I give it 5 stars, it is one of the most engrossing books I have ever read (or listened to). However I am having some difficulty with the sadness of the story. I thought it was a little too tragic for my taste.I read for pleasure and escape, and I like to be happy when its over. This is why I have read most all of Louis Lamour, some at least twice. There is good and bad, and good always wins in the end. Everyone lives happily ever after.This is my first Jonas Kirby book. I probably won't be able to stay away from the rest, this one was so moving."
5,Mark of the Stone,"Rabiah Seminole has written a wounderfully enlightening book with a message for everyone. It lets you use your imagination as you follow the journey of a young boy who learns about himself and the world that we live in, the good and the bad. Once you start reading this book it is so engrossing that you can't put it down, you want to see what is going to happen next as the journey continues. I highly recomend this book to all, young and old alike. I am looking forward to reading more books by this exciting author."
4,provoq:voyeur - philippine dvd specail,"absolutely beautiful young men. still no full frontal nudity. as before, reminds me of the early PLAYGIRL videos. here hoping this will change with time, but you can't beat these young men."
1,deceptive,"With a cover like it has, the film is mislabeled. There are so many films from the Philippines and other countries in Asia that use the deceptive cover strategy for marketing purposes. So, buyer beware!"
1,Misleading Cover...to some degree,"I bought this item with basically no idea of the ""movie"" but with a cover like that...shouldn't be too bad, right? It's basically about 10 models that have short sexual ""fantasies"" (a chapter for each). Even though the guys are the main focus...a semi-nude to nude filipina appears in most of their fantasies. THIS IS NOT REALLY AIMED FOR GAY MEN, but rather for females that like Asian guys. The guys were just okay in my book. If your looking for totally nude guys, including full frontal - look elsewhere. One scene that stands out in my mind is one of the models turns and walks toward the viewer and his frontal area is blurred. Censored?? Not part of the model's contract? Who knows...but either way..this will disappoint gay men and probably bore females."
2,Size not as advertised - only 3-Ounce,"Be aware that the size is not as advertised. The jars are only 3-Ounce Jars, not 3.53-Ounce. I like the product, just not happy about the false product description."
2,Into the Woods,"I was introduced to this production many years ago while in college. Initially, I was happy to order this production, but was highly disappointed when I discovered that the audio and video were out of sync by more than a second. I thought that a slight out of sync audio was bad, by this was so annoying that I had to just listen and not watch."
3,great musical,"I was disappointed that this wasn't the original Broadway production, but an American Theater production. I was also disappointed it was not close-captioned. Although I don't feel the seller was misleading in any way, I do wish this information had been provided."
1,no closed captioning for the deaf,"We returned ""Into the Woods"" because it had no captioning for the deaf. Since my husband is deaf, we were not able to watch it. Amazon needs to list in the discription whether the movies they sell or rent are closed captioned. We also realized recently that Amazon's movie rental downloads are not closed captioned even though the movie itself is. We stopped the download when we dicovered it was not displaying the CC. However, we were still charged for the movie rental."
2,Good for Sleeping,"In my opinion, this production was good for one thing--giving me a few minutes of sleep time. I just couldn't get into this long musical play. I tried to like the characters, but couldn't. I tried to care about the characters, but I couldn't. I kept waiting for the song, ""Children Will Listen."" Once I heard it, I used the rest of the time for sleep. I love musical theatre, but, for me, this didn't cut it."
4,Into the Woods DVD,Into the Woods DVD arrived promptly and in great shape. This is a great story. One of my favorite musicals.
5,Not a kids movie,"I enjoyed this play immensely, but parents should be warned that it is a very dark retelling of the fairy tales and not meant for children at all."
4,Good find,Another great find - a stage production on dvd. I love it and love this production. Really worth the money to get it.
5,One of the best musicals I've seen!,"I am a big fan of Broadway, and Into the Woods is one of my favorite musicals in the world. The first act interweaves six different fairy tales through the device of a new story about a baker and his wife. The second act begins with, ""Once upon a time . . . later . . ."" and tells what happens to the characters AFTER ""happily ever after."" Stephen Sondheim's lyrics are, as always, insightful, managing to relate to real life in the most absurd of theatrical situations. This is a worthwhile fairy tale for all ages."
5,But I hate musicals!,"Normally I'm not a musical lover but that fateful day I channel surfed into the original broadway production cast of ""Into the Woods"" on PBS, I was hooked. The first act is wonderful humor that will set the grimest heart laughing at the silly interactions of our beloved childhood fairy tales, while the second act will bring even the most jaded of teenagers to the brink of tears at the poigancy of the two songs near the end. All in all, it is a wonderfully written, directed and performed musical that will be loved by nearly everyone."
5,One of my favorites!,"I've loved musicals for as long as I can remember, and this has to be my favorite because you can watch it once, and look at it as a nice, entertaining story about a bunch of fairy tale characters and their problems. Or you can watch it over and over again and understand that each song is a soliliquy for each character. You get a glimpse into their souls in a way that few other musicals do. You watch each character morph as they go into the woods and learn what life is really all about. Some of my favorite quotes are from the songs in the musical. ""Isn't it nice to know a lot? And a little bit not."" I started college this year, and I feel like I've been into the woods and out of the woods, and I'm not the same. If you want an entertaining musical that with songs that get stuck in your head, this is a great buy, but then, so is Grease. If you want a musical that makes you ponder where your own life is going, Into the Woods is the best!"
5,Fairy Tale(s) with an edge,"This is a clever intertwining of 5 well-known Brothers Grimm fairy tales - in the first act. The second act takes a darker turn, and seeks to provide some life lessons. Our whole family - and especially our kids - have enjoyed this show, with its talented cast for years. Bernadette Peters is always a joy to watch."
3,Fairy Tales Revisited,"Act I is a sort of rehash of Cinderella and other fairy tales. Act II debunks these, with Cinderella and the Price splitting up and other non-happy-ending events. Except for title song, music not too interesting. But total is enjoyable."
1,No sound track,"First order arrived with no sound track. Item returned and a new DVD was sent by Amazon. Second DVD also arrived with no sound track. Item returned and a refund will be issued. It seems that the sound track problem may be a systemic problem with ""Into the Woods""."
5,Into the Woods is Sondheim's best work,"This is definitely Sondheim's greatest work, in my opinion. It is a combination of adventures, full of laughs as well as some sadness, and it is a lesson for all parents, as Miss Peters sings at the close: ""Careful what you say -- children will listen."" And of course the music is superb."
4,Into The Woods - a great take on classic fairy stories,"Love those good old stories that have been a part of your life since childhood? Cinderella, Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk? Sondheim cleverly and successfully blends several classic fairy tales into one seamless, hilarious story. Spectacular performances by the cast of this live theatre production are supported by an excellent and appropriate score, impressive costumes and great sets. This DVD captures the performance very well, and is a delightful addition to your DVD collection, whether you enjoy classic stories, live theatre, musicals, stage craft, or just plain quirky fun. Highly recommended."
5,Into the Woods,The musical is excellent...one of Sondheim best. Very funny and moving at the same time. Everyone from the cast is great especially Bernadette Peters as the witch. You laugh out loud and you are crying at the end.
4,Into the Wood,"Love this DVD but it doesn't really star Bernadette Peters. She is not in it very much so if you are looking for a Bernadette Peters vehicle, this is not it"
5,"As usual, another amazing Sondheim show","I watched this video and i enjoyed it very much. The acting is well done and so funny, and the music is not only written beautifully, but performed beautifully as well. I recommend this video to any Sondheim fan, or anyone who loves musicals at all. It is really a wonderful show."
1,"sorry sondheim, dull & self indulgent","wow what a snoozefest! and i think stephen sondheim is a musical genius. sweeney todd and follies are BRILLIANT! but this one is such a bore. there's only one song i enjoyed and it was almost a copy of sweeney's "" nothing's gonna harm you"". the cast is ideal but even so i thank the lord i never paid to see this show live."
5,Sondheim is genius!,"With all of the triteness of ""Phantom of the Opera"" crazing the nation today, ""Into the Woods"" is a breath of fresh air. This timeless tale, debuted in 1987, and won the Tony for Best Musical and Best Actress (Joanna Gleason).Sondheim's score weeps in ""Stay a Child"", growls in ""Hello Little Girl"", and dances in the main theme ""Into the Woods"".Spectacular performances from Bernadette Peters as the witch, Chip Zien as the baker, Danielle McFerland as Little Red Riding Hood, Chris Groenendahl as Cinderella's Prince, Kim Crosby as Cinderella, and Tony-winner Joanna Gleason as the baker's wife.Prepare to laugh, cry, be amazed, starled and awakened. A gem of a musical, and a jewel of a performance!"
5,INTO THE WOODS is the best video of a musical...,"If you've seen INTO THE WOODS on Broadway, you have the chance to see the same people again on this outstanding video! Whether or not you're a fan of musicals, you and your family will love this video. With a cast that includes Bernadette Peters, Robert Westenberg, etc. you're sure to love this, and you will be singing songs such as ""I Know Things Now"" and ""Giants In The Sky"" for a long time to come. The brilliant score by Stephen Sondheim truly shows in James Lapine's direction (and dialogue)in INTO THE WOODS. I love it! So will you!"
5,i love this musical,i brought this because it is a musical i loved as a child. having this dvd is almost as good as seeing this play.
2,"Great Play, But Look At The Editing","Into The Woods is one of my Sondheim favorites. Having seen the PBS presentation of this, I am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this DVD is edited. Rather than allowing one to be engaged by the staging and character interaction, this DVD uses pan and scan to isolate characters and provide sometimes inappropriate close-ups. This especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play; the staging. By forcing the viewer's perspective, this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath.I am hoping that somebody releases a version that does not presume to edit out the director's vision."
5,Into The Woods,I viewed this original production once before. Seeing it for the second time made it become even more entertaining. I am afan of Bernadette Peters and she is always wonderful. I loved her and Mandy Patinkin in Sunday In the Park With George and I think she is a superb actor as well as a singer. Love her on CD'S also.
4,Wonderful Entertainment,"""Into The Woods"" is a wonderful show featuring an excellent cast, memorable score by Stephen Sondheim, and an enduring story that you will watch again and again. This performance starring Bernadette Peters is Broadway caliber and will bring many enjoyable theater moments into your home. Highly recommended."
3,A bit long..,"A great story, poorly lit. There is often too much going on onstage for the cameras to find. (Often, performers stage right are singing while showing stage left.) I got the feeling that the video director had never seen the show before and was covering it as an athletic event.No shots closer than a waist shot, and the lighting is atrocious, no accomodations were made for the television cameras, thus many scenes are hidden in murk.I think that most Broadway shows should be recorded for posterity, but the recording needs to be designed to accomodate the TV format it will be shown on.This one is poorly done."
5,Broadway,"This is a great copy of the musical, and my daughter has watched it four times since Christmas! We couldn't be more pleased."
5,Amazing!,"Beautiful music, lots of clever lyrics, absolutely superb cast--trust me, Into the Woods (at least this performance of it) is everything you could wish for in a musical. Although the darker, more melancholy second act provides a sharp contrast to the first act's supposed 'happily ever after', I found it less jarring than interesting, and my favorite song (Last Midnight) is in it, so...yes. At the risk of sounding cliche, this is not to be missed. Even if (for some odd, inexplicable reason) the plot bores you, in my opinion it's all worth it for Bernadette Peters singing 'Lament' and 'Last Midnight'. Stunning, incredible, awe-inspiring, whatever positive adjective you want it will apply. ^^A warning, however: the songs from it seem to get stuck in your head for days. I've had 'Last Midnight' running through my head for the past two weeks or so and I keep getting this urge to swirl around a swishy cloak that I don't have."
5,This Stuff Works,"I have been taking this product for awhile now. It is the only one that really curbs my appetite like it should. It's hard to find in my area; all of the others have caffeine in them. The price from this seller is great. Thanks again, Amazon."
1,Poor durabililty,"As a seasoned griller, I have used a number of similar products. Although still a big fan of Weber grills, their accessories are of increasingly poor quality. This item stains easily and is difficult to clean. Furthermore, it's awkward handles cause it to claim more real estate than its worth. The only thing professional about this is the name. Save yourself the time and nerve of cleaning this piece of garbage and use some tin foil."
2,BBQ basket,"Good idea, maybe I have not learned how to use it well but I find that this gets stained easily and is hard to get clean. It does keep the veggies and fish from slipping through the grill but I can get the same effect from pan cooking or using foil instead. I don't think I would purchase this again. Overall I have loved all my weber products, this is my least favorite."
4,An improvement over previous non-stainless steel,"I have the stainless steel basket and a family member has the older non-stainless steel type, the stainless steel version cleans up considerably easier. I have found it cleans up without soaking it over night if you use Bar Keepers' Friend on a heavy duty sponge. I also feel that using higher-smoke point oils like peanut oil, extra-light olive oil, refined safflower, or refined avocado helps in reducing sticking, mess and clean-up effort."
3,"Great, but horrible to clean","This basket works wonderfully. However, with all the oiling we do, the only way to get this clean after using is to leave it sitting overnight with EasyOff."
4,"Liteweight, but useful","This monopod does help steady the camera, but I honestly don't use it that much. I find it easier to just lean against something."
5,Great!,I got the product in an appropriate amount of packaging in a timely manner without defect. I was completely pleased. Thank you!
2,Will do.,"For use in rough surroundings with lots of grit or fine sand, may jam. Foot (rubber end) came off. Don't know where. Very light. Were it cheaper, I'd forgive the limitations. When folded up, it is wider than a fishing bag by about 6"". Not friendly to bag attachment. Had to rig something."
3,You get what you pay for,"This tripod is ok for it's price. It's Chinese, not Italian.It does what it's supposed to, but I'm not too happy about a NASTY pinch I got when unlocking one of the levers.I would get one that has different locking levers."
5,Steady hand,"The Bogen/Manfrotto 676B monopod is a nice addition to my photo equipment. Fit and finish is excellent. It is pretty lightweight and provides excellent additional stability when you don't want to bother carrying a full tripod. I added a quick release, tilting head to complete the set-up so that I can take landscape (horizontal) pictures as well as portrait (vertical). Very satisfied. Very nice tool for the price."
2,Locking ring broke after light use,"I received this monopod as a gift. It is fairly lightweight, I found it easy to carry, and fairly easy to use. Unfortunately, I only got to use it a few times before the middle locking ring cracked. Even though it was broken, I was able to just leave that section collapsed, so I continued to use it a few more times, but now the bottom locking ring has a crack, too. The locking rings are some form of plastic, and there doesn't appear to be any way I can fix them. As a gift, I doubt I can find adequate proof of purchase to get warranty coverage, and I'd probably be obliged to pay postage anyway - On a monopod that costs $30, round-trip postage is probably a significant fraction of the cost of a new one; and unless the replacement rings are made of a different material, it'll just happen again anyway. With this experience, I can't say I'll buy a Manfrotto / Bogen monopod to replace it. I was surprised that it had a 4.5 rating."
4,monopod 676B,"Compact, lightweight, easy to pack/travel with. Only negative is 3 leg adjustments instead of 2 ."
4,good series,I was just replacing a book for my 22 yr old daughter. We had misplaced her copy. She still enjoys playing these songs from her childhood. Good series
5,Most are great,I don't really love all these songs but most of them are wonderfully done. The sound is clear and the songs are very sweet. They aren't real dance songs but they do make an impression. It's a whole CD full of songs that compel you to buy more from this band.
1,very run of the mill,like so-many boy bands of today they all seem to sing without any kind of feeling and any texture.nothing stands out.it is all formula without substance.all-4-one are a 2nd tier Boyz 11 Men.overplayed songs with little lasting impressions.also none of these bands except Hanson play or write anything.they are a push button for a Producer.
5,"Very nice frame, plus carbon fiber is an insert that can be removed if you like a cut out look","Bought this about a month ago and installed right away. Carbon fiber is an insert, just a plastic border about an inch wide to fit just behind the cut out on the frame. You can use it or don't, up to you. Looks great both ways. Does not come with screws or covers, either use your old or buy new. I added my picture."
2,NOT THE ORIGINAL MUSIC BY THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS,"Please note what one seller said: ""Brand New Karaoke CD+G/17 INSTRUMENTAL VERSIONS OF THE ORIGINAL SONGS/ALL TRACKS ARE PROFESSIONAL RE-RECORDINGS AND NOT THE ORIGINAL MUSIC BY THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS.""As far as I know, only Motown has produced Karaoke CDs with the original instrumental backings with the vocals removed. (And those are incredible!)"
5,Great Music,"I picked this up down in Denver where the artist is from. I was suprised, but glad to see it on Amazon. This is a definate must own CD. Great beats and loops, never stops.. keeps raving til dawn."
4,great blues / rock cd,"I bought MICHAEL LEE FIRKINS first solo CD and was very impressed. I ordered this CD when I found out he played in this band. As FIRKINS is a metal guitar player ( SATRIANI / HOEY etc. ), this foray into BLUES might well have been a failure, but alas the opposite is true. While being a somewhat progressive BLUES CD, their are many tradional elements as well. The harmonica of LITTLE JOHN CHRISLEY is traditional for the most part and his vocals are more than adequate for the BLUES. FIRKINS shines on guitar and keeps the energy level high while playing some inspiring guitar. The songs grow on you after a period of familiarisation. GREAT BLUES / GREAT GUITAR / GREAT HARMONICA. If that sounds like you, don't hesitate."
2,Don't walk away from this set....RUN!,"Having purchased over the years Time Life's 70's & 80's CD's, I was looking for some hits from the 90's and THOUGHT this would be a great set. NOT! At least 90% is ""dance"" music like you'd hear at a Rave party. I don't recall EVER hearing them on the radio. If you're like me....keep looking cuz this set isn't what you want."
2,"Disappointing, especially since I'm a big fan","I've read every book Jill Jones has written so far, and the synopsis for this book intrigued more than any previous title. Unfortunately, I felt it didn't live up to its promise. The author certainly did her homework on the occult, but I think the story suffered as a result. In short, it read too much like non-fiction. I found myself not caring about the characters, and the ending was anti-climactic."
5,Another Great Kevin Russell production,"Anything Kevin Russell associates himself with turns out to be a masterpiece, this CD is no exception to that rule. I would highly suggest getting your hands on any of his work. TheS.F. Blues Guitar Summit 1 & 3, are a notch better than this CD, however. If you like hard driving fast rock/blues music search out, find & purchase as much of his stuff as possible. If you don't have any of Kevin's work in your collection, you don't have a collection!"
2,Not enough music,"I bought this CD because of the great songs that were included -- However, only ""snippets"" of each song are actually on the CD. If you want the full recording of any of the titles, this is not a good choice. I was disappointed with the brevity of each selection."
1,NOT A REAL CD!,"This is only a cd of cuts from each of the songs, NOT the full songs. Don't waste your money."
5,"Love, betrayal, and the theatre all come together","David Hare's Amy's View is a startling new play. Rich, funny, sad, absurd, and thought-provoking, Amy's View leaves the reader or audience member clamoring for more. Hare presents fascinating characters in Esme Allen, a famous West End actress; her daughter Amy, who's famous ""view"" is that love conquers all; her boyfriend and soon to be husband Dominic, a cultural monolith; and Frank, a devoted companion of Esme's who's actions have devastating consequences in all of their lives. This play meshes love and betrayal with the question of whether the theatre is relevant in society anymore. The reader will be astonished. But being lucky enough to see this play performed on Broadway with Judi Dench as Esme, I love this play that much more."
4,Order this book!,This book is a great book on parenting. It can be used in everyone's life if they just use what they learn while reading this. I truly enjoyed and agreed with the 10 gifts listed at the end. I enjoyed the stories of other people and how they applied the lessons.
2,What a disappointment,I didn't realize the brand Pyle was a play on words. These were junk. I ended up wasting money on the two pair I bought for my F-150. They rattled all bass and then dropped out significantly on the low end from the stock head unit in my 2010 F150 XLT. I ended up buying some Pioneer Coaxials that sound great.
5,best cutile cream on market,"This is the best cuticle cream on the market for healthy nails. It is absorbed on nails quickly to prevent a greasy feeling. It helps create healthy, natural lovely nails."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!!,"I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this projection screen and tripod. It is easy to set up, store and travel. It closes up nicely for traveling and has a carrying handle for comfort. This item takes approximately 30 second to set up. (SERIOUSLY) It is an awesome price too. We are purchasing 3 more for different locations. I would recommend to any business professional."
4,Great Product,"This a nice product!! Heavier than I thought, but very compact. Easy to set-up and expand the projector. The screen only sits about 2 feet off the ground. It is unable to sit up high for a large group."
4,Epson Duet 80Inch,"Bigger than it looks, but surprisingly portable... As a mobile Dj this comes in handy when I include other services such as slide shows or video dj-ing.. So far I like... Might be a little too light though. A strong gust of wind and this thing looks like it will be on its back. Build quality ok. Not the best but enough to get the job done. For the price I'll take it."
4,"Great wide-screen, not as tall as I'd like.",We do dive-in movies during the summer and fire pit movies during the winter. I really have no complaints with this screen. It is absolutely easy to set up and take down and it's so easy to store. My only regret is that it's not as tall as I wanted. But then again the larger screens cost more.
4,Good quality screen!,"This screen is very good. It is very heavy to haul around and the top center tends to sag. It does do the job as I have a wide angle projector, and this is the only screen that I have seen that adapts well to wide angle."
4,Projector Screen,"Very nice screen, but it could use a device on the top centre of the screen to hold the screen in place and prevent slight buckling of the screen"
4,Duet Projector Review A,"Great product. Easy to setup and takedown, facilitates great movie and gaming views. Improvements would be adjustable heights and stronger locking system for normal and wide screen viewing. That said, definitely a great addition to portable skatepark program! [..]"
3,Just wish it were taller,"I bought a couple of these and generally we are happy with them. However, they are shorter than we hoped for and unless you have it sitting on top of something, it is difficult to see if you have a large room. It would be nice if they sold an extension piece or something like that to help make it taller. Maybe they do now, but I couldn't find anything like that and consider making something myself but never did."
2,One major drawback...,"The top and bottom of the screen curl backwards in the center. There is no clip or additional piece to secure the screen so that it does not curl. The screen comes with a wall mount kit, however you would have the same problem as the lattice-type suspension behind the screen keeps the screen a good 2 inches away from the wall.If you have a professional keynote or powerpoint presentation in 16:9 format, the top of the screen has a big shadow area from the bending of the screen. The bottom 3 inches of the screen has a shadow area as well that is about 2.5 feet long."
5,Great Portable Screen,This screen is terrific! The screen collapses into a case with a convenient carrying handle. It easily fits in the trunk or across the back seat. My wife has used it on the road for presentations and just loves it. I've used it to convert 8mm movies to digital format by projecting the old movies onto the screen and recording them with my camcorder.
3,"Like The Innovation, but Screen Curling Will Be An Issue For Some","I like the ""way"" the screen works. It is innovative and unique. It folds up easily and sets up and comes down quickly. I have not used the wall bracket.There is definitely a design flaw here that some have spoken about. The screen ""curls"" backwards for me at the top middle section of the screen because there is nothing supporting the weight of the screen when you pull it all the way out - it basically sags backward at the top center. The curling makes the top 2-3 inches of the screen unusable. For me, I don't mind much because I don't really use the entire screen size because we have a small office.However, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES IF you expect to project onto the entire screen. The curling makes the top 2-3 inches of the screen simply unusable unless you don't mind significant distortion."
1,Not Satisfied,"Screen sagged badly along the top and the screen could not be adjusted to a higher position.This might work well on a wall, but although easily handled, left us unsatisfied with its screen."
3,Projector Screen,Certainly a good price and well constructed. However a little heavy and without a carrying case a little difficult to transport. Fits well within a standard duffle bag. No real vertical adjustmant can make it a little challenging for other than standard floor mounting use. Wall mounting is a nice feature for a meeting room/family room.
5,Simplicity at its best,I use this at my karaoke shows set up is a breeze and works like it should. Highly recommend this for anyone wanting portability .
2,Great Idea That Needs Work,"Pros: screen sizes, portability, very easy to open, stable and innovative design.Cons: mild sag in top mid screen (not too bad) snd the clincher, screen coating did not affoard a smooth, crisp picture!!!Epson has a great idea that needs more work!!!"
1,Not for me,This Screen is for Wide Screen movie viewing! It folds out like an accordion and does not seem sturdy enough for out of home use. I returned it ASAP.
4,Worth the money,Setting it up is easy and the screen is great. The adjustable lenght is great for widescreen viewing. It's on the heavy side but it's solidly build and will last if you take care of it. The minor con is that the height is set and can't be adjusted higher and you can't adjust the view angle. Overall it's a great compact portable screen at a great price.
1,SAGS,"This screen has such great potential. Mounts to the wall easily, opens and closes easily and overall, looks great. BUT the middle of the screen sags about 1-2 inches!! It makes the entire screen useless. If you watch a movie on wide screen setting, it bends the image at the top. Not good at all."
2,It has the spots on the screen. Please check yours.,"I just brought this product but not happy with quality of product. First one I brought it has a spot on the screen, then decide to have a replacement. Well bad luck again! The replacement one is even worse that has two spots on the screen. I don't know if AMAZON is checking the product before sending out to the customer."
5,THIS SCREEN IS GREAT,"This is a great screen! on movie night I set it up in front of my 55"" plasma and it looks like a tv because of how the screen opens side ways.but it sure makes my 55 look small after the movie!the size when down is awsome for storage or taking it with us. we set it up on the patio for what we call drive in night and even with a little wind it is very stable because it opens side ways, how cool great job epson! I orignaly bought it to hang on the wall along with my new epson powerlite presenter projector but we use it everywhere."
3,not high enough,I must not have realized that though it's wide it's not tall enough for my projector. It's sitting in storage
4,Good one,"I received promptly on time. Easy to set up and use, portable, easy to adjust scree size based on video format You are watching. I don't see any issues. It has very strong and steady stand framework"
5,Screen,This was the coolest thing I ever saw. I will be using this to DJ videos . To watch movies on it was an Experience. cool as hell. very ez to set up. Love the way it opens up cool. Yup I recommend this one to anyone
3,"Compared to regular portable tripod screen, the duet is NOT the lightest, cheapest, or smallest.....","For it's price, it's actually a good deal if you use it as a business presentation and watching wide screen movies. But compared to regular portable tripod screen, it is not the most portable, lightest, or cheapest tripod screen out there. I found an Elite portable 71"" x 71"" tripod screen for $50 including tax and shipping. It's thinner, lighter (only 15 lbs. compared to Duet which is 30lbs.), and cheaper!!"
3,Not what I had expected.,"Bought this thinking that it would be a quality screen, despite the cost. Once it arrived, I opened it and set it up, easily mind you, but was disappointed with the amount of curling the screen does at the top and bottom. I don't think that the tensioners on either side are quite tight enough to hold the edges taut. I returned this item for aDa-Lite 83315 60-Inch Insta-Theater Portable Projection Screen. The Da-Lite is more expensive but is designed a lot better and the edges don't curl. It should also be noted that the Epson tri-pod style legs take up a lot of space and can only be turned one direction (read: one leg straight back), so if you need the space around it, you can't adjust it very well."
1,enough already,"I completed this book some days ago, my initial thoughts of a less than original story remain to this day. Yes the book is an okay read, but 1 star out of 5 it also remains. Not an original idea within the entire book, more like a movie of the week. You will find this copy in the nearest used book store this afternoon."
5,One man's spiritual journey,"I was fortunate to meet Ray Brooks during a book signing event in Taos. I was touched by his warmth and by the almost palpable feeling of well-being that emanates from him. ""Blowing Zen"" tells the true story of how Ray found his bliss (and a new career) through ""shakuhachi"", the art of the Zen flute. The book is a great read, not only for Ray's account of his experiences, but also for his highly descriptive style that puts the reader right there with him. His sensitivity for foreign cultures and practices is refreshing. I recommend this book without reservation for its delightful style and uplifting message."
4,From London to Tokyo,"In ""Blowing Zen"", Ray Brooks takes his readers on the perfect adventure. The experience is spontaneous, intelligent, funny and peaceful. Traveling from London to Tokyo, Brooks learns the shakuhachi and masters the art of living."
5,Blowing My Mind,"This book is a magical thing. Ray Brooks is a wonderful storyteller whose stories are compelling and meaningful. Brooks offers an alternative to the fast-paced life we're constantly being sold by showing us how he found happiness in simplicity. Brooks' life continually takes twists and turns which provide the book with an interesting story, but through it all the author reminds us to seek inner peace and thus succeed. The stories made me laugh and the message made me think."
4,Monkey Business,"The orangutan is a ton of fun, and it is nice and fluffy just like I wanted it to be!"
4,guitar player,"richie kotzen,it,s a good instrumental cd, excellent guitar work on the cd, and stu hamm bass playing is excellent, and i,ll recommend anybody to purchase or give it a listen."
3,Who's KiddingWho?,My opinion of Jonas probably would not persuade anyone to read his works. But as I'm not aloud to review my own publications I certainly don't think James W. Drury should be allowed to give his opinion on this book since his name is credited as helping put the book into the media. Just as my opinion would not be any different than Henry Ford writting an opinion on a ford product.
5,I rode with Tom McLean the whole way,"I got interested in Kirby Jonas because a friend of mine told me my name was in one of his books. When I read Legend of the Tumbleweed, I was astounded at the clarity and feeling in this book. It's all in first person, but seen through the eyes of a bunch of different people. The main character is an outlaw, but a lot of the other characters who get their chance to talk are in the posse that's chasing him. This book is emotionally charged all the way through, and I can honestly say Kirby Jonas, with this book more than any other, has replaced Louis L'Amour for me. Kirby Jonas is the best writer going, and I hope everyone gets a chance to try him out. Where in the woodwork did Jonas come from so suddenly?"
1,No heroes in this book,I purchased three books by Jonas after reading some of the reviews. It was a complete waste. I had to force myself to read them. There are no heroes in his books and the main characters come off as weak and uninteresting. Real-life average people do not make for good reading. I'll stick to re-reading my Louie books.
3,Good but does not cover all models,"Haynes Manuals are great to have for servicing your vehicle. I obtained this manual for my Previa and will use it for basic repairs. NOTE: The Haynes Manual ""does not include all-wheel drive or supercharged engine information""If you have ALL-TRAC and/or S/C on your Previa certain information will not be covered in this Haynes guide."
4,Pretty damn good.,"Never heard of this group, I liked the samples I had heard and gave this a few good listens.I like the lyrical content, I like that it's both deep in thought and not full of gay abstract garbage such as I'd find with Atmosphere or other independent groups.I like the sampling, it reminds me of early 90s hiphop, I like the fact there aren't a million over dubs and ad libs, just natural voices and nice raps.My favorite tracks so far are squad car, place called hiphop and record keeps spinnin."
4,olish film glory,This Polish Oscar entry in 2011 is definitely highly recommended. The true story is fascinating and keeps you guessing until the final gripping moments of the movie. See it!
4,Another Schindler,"I cannot even imagine what it would be like to live for a year or more in the filthy, smelly sewers, relying on one man to bring food,water, clothing and other items. This is what is depicted in this true story of a man who looks after a group of Jews hiding from the Nazis in Poland. Harrowing."
3,"""Living on the Edge of Death""","I can't fault the acting, but the film itself is probably 30-minutes too long-- with seemingly endles scenes of what amounted to living on the edge of death in the sewers of Poland in 1944. Very painful to watch the persecution, hunting and deliberate murder of civilians by a merciless regime and its mercenaries. There is obviously an inspirational message here, but I'm not sure it adds to what we already basically know or whether it's worth 2 and 1/2 hours of viewing time."
2,Badly Made and Imitative,"The filmmaker apparently wanted to make her own version of ""Schindler's List"". She does so, and imitates all that film's faults : it's overdone, manipulative, garishly melodramatic, and vulgar. Would that she had focused more on ""The Pianist"" instead, a film that demonstrates the power of realism and understatement, and is the polar opposite of this one."
5,Riveting and powerful!,"A Polish film about Jews who hid in sewers from the Nazis during WWII. They were assisted by a local man who worked in the sewers and know his way around them. This was a very realistic movie that portrays the horrors of the treatment of the Jewish people by the German soldiers, and provides a glimpse of life on the run and the strong human desire to live. The dilemma of the man who is assisting them is apparent, as he must balance his desire to shield the Jews with his priority of protecting the lives of his own wife and child. This is a powerful movie that you do not want to miss."
4,Riveting,"With the notable exception(s) of Kieslowski's trilogy of films (Blue, White, and Red, especially Red), this is the finest Polish film that I've seen. In Darkness is powerful, unsentimental, and riveting.Amazingly, after the film was done, the director, Agnieszka Holland, discovered that a key character in the film version of this true WWII survival story--the little Jewish girl (Krysia Chiger)--was still alive. The two women met in Warsaw in 2011, and their conversation is replayed in one of the film's supplemental features. Here, Mrs. Krystyna Chiger-Karen (she had married Marion Karen, a survivor who had been helped by Oskar Schindler) spoke movingly about how ""everything"" that the director ""put into the film was true.""Agnieszka Holland can go toe-to-toe with the best of today's international film directors, and ""In Darkness"" is a testament to that truth, as well.PS. The video and audio quality of the bluray disc is very good."
1,Not as advertised,"Not as advertised it says it is a kit ,- one would assume that it was a kit too be used over and over , not at all happy !!!too much money and would never order again!!"
1,so stupid!,"This is SO stupid! I don't have it, I love techno, but this? come'on, I just listened to 4 of those little clips and they sound the same! Some techno music! don't get this!"
1,Not enough fill,"This chair is awful. It arrived as a large hard rectangle that took over an hour to ""pufify."" Now we have a flat circle. There is no puf. I am completely annoyed about the lack of product quality."
2,Extremely disappointed!,"I purchased this beanbag for my son for his room as a Christmas gift. When it arrived, it was rather big so I decided to give it to him earlier. When we opened the box up it was the oddest thing the way it was packed and we found it humorous to unpack it. The foam was packed EXTREMELY tight so we had to work to break up the foam so that it was looser. We finally finished and found that there wasn't enough foam to fit the material so the bean bag laid pretty flat! We kept trying to bunch it together so that it would form a seat the way it is pictured in the photo but to no avail! Every time my son sat down on the seat it would expand and flatten out and he'd wind up on the floor. He was so disappointed that we decided to send it back and boy oh boy was that a task trying to get that back in the box!!! Why do they advertise this one way and send it to you another way? For an item that is so expensive, the least they could do is represent the item honestly."
4,I love this product,I love this product. I lost 4 pounds in one week and went from 163 pounds down to 131 in 2 months. I was full of energy and I loved it. The only bad thing was that I would have issues sleeping because i would take it like after 7 pm. If your going to use it Id suggest taking the pills between 6AM to 6PM cuz of the energy buzz.
5,Excellent!,"This compilation is outstanding for anyone who loves Ewe music, and I believe it is the only compilation of its kind. The liner notes are also terrific."
4,excited,I am excited to plant some strawberries!Make sure you have plenty of time and patience to put this together!You will need at least one helper! It took my husband any our 11 yr old son about 4 hours to put togeter and fill with dirt.Good luck!
2,Small,"Got this to plant strawberries in, only got about 20 in it. Says max 6ft, only if you have 1 tier. The strawberries grew great with it, but the problem is when you weed around it they just rip out the plant next to it since there is not much room for the roots. Wish I would of got something else to grow my stawberries in."
4,Kind of hard to put together-but OH those berries!!,"Once you finally get this thing to stay together, (you have to fill part of the way with dirt to keep the sides steady) it is easy to use, easy to water, and the berries keep on coming!Strongly suggest you put landscaping pebbles or stones (fabric is better, perhaps both) around the perimeter about 3-4 inches, so it's easier to mow around without bashing into it.Remember to remove 90% of the runners so that your berries don't ""wear themselves out"" in a couple years.Maintain plants in the late fall by clipping down to just above the crown, toss out the top of plants.Be sure not to skrimp on soil, or it will fill with water at each heavy rain, and some soil will wash out in the ensuing flood. Plus this will keep the sides sturdy.Mulch with straw in winter, berries come back early spring when mulch is removed!Great idea!"
2,Glamorise Women's Wonderwire Seamless Molded Support Bra,"I purchased this bra based on the fabulous reviews on this site. I am usually a 34D but as that size was not available I opted for a 36C. Although the bra did feel comfortable, the bra provided very little support and definitely did not ""lift."" I actually felt a little droopy with the bra on. Also the cups are very thin material and not lined. Overall I was disappointed with this bra."
3,Not the greatest,"I'd recommend Glamorise Magic Lift Full Figure Active Support Bra for around the same price. I ordered both and I found that the Glamorise Wonderwire (the one I'm doing the review on) isn't as comfortable. Both look good (smooth under clothes). It is supportive, but not as much as the Magic Lift one. :)"
3,It could have been a great bra...,I was so very excited to receive my bras. It gets so expensive. I wear a 42G and always have to order by catalog or online. The cups just barely fit me and the straps were too short. I was so disappointed.
5,Luv it.....,It is my 1st time buying bras from overseas and I am really glad that it fits me perfectly!!I am really happy with the product. Definitely will buy again
3,Not very comfortable,"I found this bra did not live up to my expectations of comfort that I expected from the description. I believe it does give good support, but even after trying several adjustments of the straps and the back closure, the underwires are positioned so that they painfully cut into my ribcage. I would recommend you try the Lilyette Maximum Support bra by Maidenform for great underwire support with maximum comfort. This bra is made with quality, but for my needs, I will not buy another one."
3,Garage Remote,Unfortunately it was the wrong opener for my garage door. I must say the company Community Controls was very helpful in responding and taking care of me. I'm still waiting for the replacement product but it's only been a few days. The only rap I have is the one I returned was oretty big and bulky but what do you expect for $15.00. I would definately deal with Community Controls in the future.
2,Door Open...,"Shortly after buying, I had to buy a new garage door opener and the transmitter would not work with the new opener. Now I need another opener and this one does not work."
3,Not so great,Knife does not snap open so you have to be careful that it does not close on you while using it.
1,How can a cable go wrong?,"There was a review from another customer for an identical Scosche cable that only received a one-star rating. I thought the customer who left that review/rating was just unlucky, so I took a risk and got one. I mean how can a cable be defective? Well, I was sure wrong...lightning must have struck twice because mine was a complete defect like that other unfortunate customer. The cable didn't eliminate noise...it increased it! There was static, buzzing, and zapping noises... I don't know what was going on--maybe electrical shocks/pulses?--but my mp3 player kept blinking back and forth from track to track, voice record, FM tuner, etc; didn't feel good. I'll never buy any audio cables from Scosche again."
4,very pleased,"Amazon was great, the book i got was in great shape, mack bolan series is a great series. I recomend amazon.com to everyoneThanksJoe Thibault"
3,Super Reader,"The mafia have been backtracking Bolan's life, to find out where he is likely to turn. They track down his old sniping partner, and he is forced to rescue him.They get the idea to form a Death Squad, to work as a team for some serious mafia elimination work.Cue action movie after that, with a special police squad caught in the middle, called together to try and stop The Executioner.All does not go well."
5,Fun and feels great!,This massager looks phallic but works wonderfully! I keep it in my desk at work and we all takes turns using it when we have a difficult day. It feels amazing!
3,Simple but not very effective.,"Item is simple and easy to use. Unfortunately you have to press pretty hard for it to do much and it is hard to get the leverage. On a comical note, it looks like a set of male genitalia."
4,Nice Markers!,"I recently purchased a color set of these markers and I've really been enjoying them but there were no greys so when I found this set I was very happy. I really love these markers. The colors lay down smoothly and dry quickly. A good alternative if you cannot afford Copics. The only reason I rate four stars is they do have an odor, a bit like a Sharpie, and they do bleed a bit. That's not too much of an issue though if you have Bristol paper on hand.I'm really liking these makers so far, and would recommend them."
4,Great for concept work,My husband and I both use these when coloring our concept art for projects we're working on. I love the chisel tip side whenever I do broad strokes and he likes the fine tip side for detailing. Great product.
5,Great Markers...good bargain here...,Prisma Color makes good products I use all of their products and have created some good art. I would recommend these markers to all artist.
5,BEst there is,"Great set of markers, i work in ink and this is the only brand i use. The light colors especially are fantastic."
4,Dragon's Lair 2: Time Warp,"I don't believe this was ever made for the arcade. It is the sequel to Dragon's Lair which WAS made for the arcade way back in 1983. The animation is outstanding and while the game is mostly luck, it's fun none the less. It even has some nice special features just like movie DVD's. Enjoy!"
1,Breast Changes,"This booklet was developed by the National Cancer Insitute and was available for free. It is now out of date. PLease go to the National Cancer Institute's website to order a free copy of the updated version, or to see one online. Best to you!"
3,"""You're my boy, Blue!""",I LOVE the mommy test! Every morining I listen to Kidd Kradic just to hear this. It's good for a getting ready for school laugh!
1,Lexmark Z23,"The only good thing about the printer is the initial price. Don't get too happy, cause you will open your bank account for the ink. When you open the box you will find the need for the black ink. After printing a few pages get ready to shell out more money to replce the ink, as this printer goes through it fast. For the amount of inkl it uses the print quality isn't that great. If you let it sit for a week without use be prepared for the streaking; that doesn't go away. This was the first Lexmark I owned and I should say it will be the last."
2,Awful Resolution,"I got this printer free when I bought a computer, and there's a reason that it's free. The only thing it's basically good for it to print out typed documents which come out fine. Forget pictures though. Even small pictures are all blury and the printer can't handle diagonal lines at all.If you need a cheap printer right away, I suppose this one would be in your price range, but if you ever plan to print out pictures, pay an extra hundred dollars and get a decent printer. Why not go all out and get a laser printer?"
2,Lexmark Z23,The Lexmark Z23 uses way too much ink. I just bought one color & one black. I bought a new stack of printer paper. I got maybe 1/4 through the paper and it runs out of ink. I guess it would be great if you don't mind buying ($$$) worth of ink every 2 weeks. Lela
3,Lexmark Printer,"I recieved a Lexmark Z23 for christmas, it works great for the new computer I also recieved. It is compatible with windows xp and it is very easy to setup. I have found however, that it is nearly imposible to find the inkjet cartridges for it yet. I don't know if it is because I live in BFE Alaska or if it is too new for stores to carry. I was a little disapointed that while it comes with a color cartridge, it does not come with a black cartridge and so am relegated to ordering over the internet for something that should be a quick purchase in a local store."
1,Cheap but still a waste of money,"I purchased my Z23 less than a year ago along with theblack toner cartridge. It did a nice job for the firstfew weeks. I've printed maybe 20 lightly colored pages.After sitting for several weeks with outuse, the printer has never been the same. Streaks andnow complete loss of two colors. I emailed technicalsupport over a week ago and still haven't gotten a reply.I've tried their online suggestions for cleaning the cartridgeswith little inprovement.My experience with this product has been bad. I dare notinvest in another ink cartridge with as unreliable theyhave been for me."
1,Print Quality Fades!!! Save Your Money!!!,...Print cartridges are sooo expensive... No wonder they give this as (almost) free!!! At first the quality (color photo) looks very nice... after (like) 7 print-outs (just 3 x 4)... goodbye nice quality!!! Say hello to 150dpi quality!!! I followed the instructions how to clean the nozzles and the rest (from Lexmark tech support)... still the same!!! Bad quality!!! Both ink cartriges are new (I have to buy the color...)...
1,What A Fun Printer,We have ended up with two lexmark printers. They came free with computers that we purchased. I found out why. We had installation problems anf when we tried the customer support we got alot of e-mails that said all of the same thing but no real help. We finally got one of the printers to work but it still would give an error message every time we started it up. It used alot of ink and you rarely find the black ink cartridges. The other printer has become junk. I took it to a computer programmer that I work with and he told me the same thing that lexmark support did. I am glad to see that they at least give away most of their junk so at least you don't feel like you paid for it.BUY THIS PRINTER AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!
1,Sending it to the scrap heap!,"The wrost printer I have ever used. When trying to print photos, it will only print half of an 8X10 before stopping. On documents of 5 pages or more it will stop after about 3. There is just no guts in this printer. Even though I bought it just 2 months ago, I put it in the trash today, and I am smiling that, at least I will not have to mess with it again."

4,Anarchy - Buss still Keeps it for the Street,"Anarchy is a definate buy. As buss says, ""Real authentic hip hop. Thats what the album brings. If you like beats...there street for real. I didn't find a party song on the album though like how his other albums had though. However, Buss brings the heat every time. Flipmode is the squad!!!!"
3,Too much...,"Busta needs to slow down on his releases and put a quality product. He could have been the man, but his past few albums have been pretty bad."
4,THIS CD IS AMAZING!,"Busta Rhymes is back! For anyone that thought he ""fell off"" last album, be sure to check this one out! From anthems like ""Bladown"" to smooth flows like ""Get out of Here"" This album is gonna liven up any house party! Busta Rhymes is still one of the best rhymers out there! Go buy this CD now!"
3,Just Not The Same Busta,"Busta Rhymes fourth release, ""Anarchy"", is somewhat of a disapointment. Compared to Busta's other three albums, this album falls way short. The Album starts off with the upbeat song, ""Salute Da Gods"", this song is not half bad. It is followed by a humdrum, numbing composition of beats that really gets quite boring. The album finally wakes up with ""Get Out"". This song seems to be the turning point for the album for its gets better after this song. The songs with Flipmode and MOP are tight. DMX and Jay-Z give solid performances. Overall, the album results in 3 stars, but this is not the same Busta Rhymes as before."
4,A Good Album!,"Although I still feel Busta Rhyme's 2nd album, When Disaster Strikes, has been his best, this album comes close. The first single from the album, ""Get Out"" is a good enough reason to purchase the album. As soon as i purchased the album, I have been listening to that song and I'm still not sick of it! I feel that song has been Bustah's only worthy successor to ""Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Can See"". Sure ELE was whack and all, but the album has restored my faith in Bustah. His off-beat sense of humor is still evident and bigger than ever. The album is full of dope beats and awesome lyrics that Bustah spits out at 100,000 miles an hour. That said, GET OUT and buy this album! You won't regret it!"
4,Bust one for me,"Yo, the new Busta was all right. It wasn't better than E.L.E. or When Disaster strikes, but it is still all right. The tightest tracks are ""Why we die"", ""C'mon all my people"", and ""Live it up"". If you buy this CD it won't be a waste of money. It has good soilid tracks, but not to many hot tracks that will blow up on Mtv and radio. If you are a Busta fan, go get it, but if you are just a casual fan, you can stay away and lestin to ""Get Out"" on the radio."
4,Blazing ! It's on Fire !,This LP is Busta's illest project to date. His fourth solo LPis just great. Ya'll really need to check it out. -How can you go wrong. 22 Banging tracks !
4,Bus-A-Bus,"This new album by Busta Rhymes is very good. There are some very explicit lyrics but nothing that a teenager couldn't handle. This album is definatly not for youngsters. The track ""Anarchy"" is very good."
4,Not bad!,Bustas attempt at a more meaningful cd turned out to be pretty good! He has really matured his style and it is alot easyier to understand his message.
4,Good but...,"The Anarchy is pretty good, better than E.L.E., but Busta hasn't really been on top of his game since When Disaster Strikes. The best song on the album, hands down, is his 1st single, Get Out. Its not worth buying unless you're a big Busta fan."
5,He does it again!,"Busta Rhymes new cd is his best yet. Anarchy is a much better album than recent releases from big names such as eminem, dr dre, 504 boyz, big tymers, Jay-z, dmx, etc. This album is great, period. The best songs are fire, ready 4 war w/ mop, The Heist w/ wu-tang, Anarchy, and All night. Also check out Rah Diggas album, Dirty Harriet. Thank you Busta Rhymes for putting out so many classic cds."
4,Not Busta's Best,"i love busta's style. charismatic, fun, and great to get the part going. and when he gets more serious or vengeful, such as on ""Hail Mary"" with Busta Rhymes and 50 Cent which is tearing up mixtapes and radio, he is still great. this album just wasnt as good as he can be. its still good though, although not busta's best. fiery beats and apocalyptic/party lyrics, and enough energy to last through an Apocalypse, this album is good, but some lackluster production brings it a step down. busta fans, and hip hop fans buy it.Fav. Songs: ""Salute Da Gods"", ""Bladow"", ""Fire"", ""Live It Up"", ""Show Me What You Got"", ""Cmon All My N*****, Cmon All My B*****"", ""Make Noise"", ""Ready For War"", ""Why We Die"""
4,BUSTA AND FLIPMODE NEVER CEASE TO AMAZE ME,"It's hard to believe that a rapper in today's world of rap can produce three albums in a row on a theme other than ""gangsta."" Busta's raps about nothing but ... well nothing. Even though his lyrics barely make sense, his flow and style is remarkable in it's own right. His lyrics can also make you laugh and always have a positive feel to them. His songs are just very up-tempo songs that make you feel good. Swizz Beats always accompanies Busta with some of their best stuff. Although the ""end of the world"" syndrome is sort of old now, Busta manages to follow the same successful formula. The only thing missing from this cd is the slow duo he had on the previous two album's (hence the 4 star rating). But he replaced it with a heart-felt ode to him and his ""homies"" growing up which is good too. Overall, definitely a good rap album. Thanks for the music Busta ... Flipmode lives on 4-eva!"
2,Busta Bust,"""The Coming"" is a classic hip hop record, one that any fan of his should have. Since then, he has gone too commercial to remain as hardcore as he pronounces to be. Busta is one of my favorite MC's, but when I listened to Anarchy, all I heard were recycled lyrics. The beats and music kicked as usual, but this was a lackluster effort."
3,O.K.,I personally think Busta's first three albums were better. I thought the track with M.O.P is the dopest on the album. I expected a lot more from Busta; I guess change is good sometimes.
4,Busta took us through total anarchy on this one.......Tight!,"This new one from Busta suprised me. I didn't expect him to drop a another one so fast. After hearing ""get out"" I was kinda thinking whether or not I should buy this. Then I heard another track called ""Bladow! "" and decided to get it. Was it worth it? yes! Even though I still think his best album is somewhere between When Disaster strikes and ELE, this one is a good follow up. The intro goes through news reports like the Columbine shoting, Ellian, etc... to show you what he means by the world being in total anarchy. Compared to ELE , this one is more concious and the beats hit with a more street vibe than ElE. Overall, If your a fan of busta don't miss this. If your not a fan you should check it out. You might be suprised.get it!"
3,GIMME SOME MO!,"Another album for Busta will go down in the books, but I was expecting more from this album. Again Busta reps the Flipmode Squad and features MC's like Jay-z, DMX, M.O.P. (salute), Raekwon, and Ghostface Killa. That's right NYC is all over this album but it still could have been a better album. Flipmode 2000 will be out soon and I have no doubts about that album.One, V"
4,Great CD!,"I think this CD is definetely one of my favorite. It has over 20 tracks, and I like most all of them! There is swearing on this album, but it isnt has bad as other artists. But, if you are buying it, you are aware of that fact, so you will still enjoy this music. He has multiple musicians appearing in this album. Some are as well known as DMX and Lenny Kravitz, but other artist that arent as popular, like Ghostface Killah ,add to this album. These other musicians are also advertising there own music by making Busta's music the best possible. His music is a definite rap, but it isnt the heavy, ugly rap that people arent into anymore. All his songs have an awesome, distinct beat that sets the stage for him to go wild. This is one of the best CD's I own, and I highely urge you to pick this album up soon!"
3,"good, but not as good as the last.","Busta's lyrical skills really show on this album, but the beats are not like his past. He had excellent guest, awesome lyric, but the beats just weren't there this time."
5,A CD that is a MUST HAVE!,"I had to get this CD when it came out yesterday and what a CD it is. Busta Rhymes and his 4th CD compares to the others, but I like this the most and I recommend it!"
1,Not That Great,Busta's last three albums were off the hook but his latest lacked to me. I did like the track with M.O.P though.
1,What Happened?,"I EXPECTED A LOT FROM BUSTA AND THE ONLY TRACK I LIKED WAS ""READY FOR WAR"" WITH MOP. THIS ALBUM COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. I WAS REALLY SHOCKED WHEN I HEARD IT."
1,What!,I'm sorry but what's with the Anagist sign on this CD? Is he trying to make some kind of fashion statement? Geeez give me a break!
4,Smooth Bass filled beats,Good Album Busta...I love this album! Nite time beats for a system great album and a must buy!!!!
4,WHOOOHAAA,"very good cd, could have had some better beats , the track called ""salute da gods"" is a very good song with phat lyrics and a tight beat. Overall, this cd is very good, in my opinion, bustas best yet..."
4,Anarchy,"After Jay Z's ""Hard Knock Life"" I wondered who would be the next artist to come with kids in the chorus (which is nuttin' nu). In ""Get Out"" Busta Rhymes' kiddie chorus is not just another on the bandwagon song. It's a certified head banger. My advance copy of Anarchy is constantly being pumped throughout my office and always in my whip (sorry dats car 4 da ebonically impaired). If you ain't feelin' this joint why u even brother browsing thru da Hip Hop section. ""Get Out"" and stay out. Anarchy is definitely one of the top Albums to cop this summer."
3,"Just ok, Busta slowing down","After a great album in The Coming and When Disaster Strikes, Busta is still great, but losing his touch, becoming too commercial...Get Out is fairly decent, except the annoying kids...Busta should stop while he is ahead and just do more with Flipmode Squad and cameo appearances. If you are a Busta fan get it, if not, get his earlier albums."
4,BLADOW!,"i had fun listening to this album. busta always comes nice every album, and always has that slammin production to back him up. he's got a special ability to make hardcore blazin music. id recommend this to everyone....not as good as e.l.e. but still blazini also cant beleive some of the artists he worked w/this time...he really got some big names for this! definite buy!"
4,Busta does it again!,"Once again, Busta Rhymes makes another album full of great songs. Just like E.L.E., The Coming, and When Disaster Strikes, Anarchy is full of great beats, and catchy tunes. If you like Busta's other CDs, be sure to pick this one up. You won't be disappointed."
4,Hot Album,"This Busta album is hot. There's a few tracks that are nott all that like in the beginning after track three. But from tracks 8-13 are good. Track 12 with Ghostface Killah and Raekwon and the other guy is hot. Track 14 and 17 are good. But the real hot song, the song that makes me want to give te album 5 plus plus stars, is the the song with M.O.P. ""Ready 4 War"", track 19. Oh Lord, when I heard this song, I nearly jumped out the window of my bedroom. This song is what made the album, basically MADE the album. If only Busta Rhymes made more songs on the album like that."
2,NOT AS INSPIRED AS HIS PAST WORK.,"This release is still very new so perhaps it just hasn't grown on me yet, but I typically judge music on how it makes me feel when I hear it for the first time, and so far this just hasn't hit. While far from being a failure, ""Anarchy"" simply doesn't hold together as well as past works. So far the only standouts are the child-like sing-songy ""Get Out"" and ""Live It Up"" with superb production by Jay Dee from the Ummah. The iffy quality of this release hardly warrants it's 75 minute length, and makes me think perhaps it's time for Bussa Buss to take some time off from acting and dedicate more time to producing top-notch music again, we fans deserve nothing less. O well, maybe next time......."
5,WELCOME BACK BUSTA!!!!,"Busta has been my favourite m.c. since the New School was new school, and he didn't let me down. Yet still the album will never top E.L.E. or When Disater strikes ... yes it will! the album is non stop energy!! I'd use this as a soundtrack when watching Armageddon!!! Yah!! Yah!!"
2,I liked the video.,"I respect that you people like him but I can't understand a word he's saying. I think that it's cool that he can rhyme that fast but if you like pop music then this isn't the best CD for you but if your heart's set then by all means buy it. The song ""Fire"" was pretty good but I just couldn't understand him!"
4,BUSTA COMES THRU,"this album is exactly what you would expect from busta rhymes. high energy, nice beats, although it lacks lyrical skill, this is good music when just chillin with friends."
5,Great album,His mix of different kinds of beats is wild and he continues to produce an array of sounds that always seems to keep you hoppin. I absolutely love this new album.
4,This album is Busta at his best!,"I just got the ""Anarchy"" album this morning and went through it and it is sweet. The beats are true to his style. His style is clean and the album has one great song after another. My suggestion to everyone is to purchase this right away. You will not be disappointed!"
4,Sourcebok for urban living in the new millenium,"This book is a bible for anyone seeking to live in a community without contributing to the growing crisis in infrastructure provision. It shows in practical terms, illustrated with easily understood sketches and diagrams,and supported by easily read and understood tables, ways to live more independently of, and offer less of a burden to our city. First published in 1974, it was a quarter century ahead of its time. Its time has come."
3,Great Book but Beware,"This is a great book and I hate to ding it but, it is listed as a new book and is not. It is a reprint of a book form the 70's published by the Sierra Club.Good info but VERY dated."
2,"after couple of uses, rust starts to develope inside and outside","pros: bigcons: cheap material, rust starts to develop after 2 weeks even I take good care of it.summary: don't buy this product."
4,Not bad!,"It's okay..... it serves it purpose, only con is that the cover is a bit hard to get off. But I am still going to keep it....good size."
4,Larger Than You Might Expect,Shaker is gigantic and quite convenient for making a batch of cocktail to serve to a larger group.
2,60 oz.stainless shaker,"I looked over the previous reviews before I purchased, the shaker dose leak a little if you do not push the top down firmly and came with a little bit of manufacturing residue. Overall it was a hit because I could mix up large batches of drinks at one time. Just take some extra time before using to wipe down the product with hot soapy water and be careful when pouring so as not to leave a mess!"
2,Large But Leaks,"I purchased this Jumbo Cocktail Shaker by Lush Life after sending back the Oggi Jumbo Cocktail Shaker because it leaked and appeared to be used. When I received the Lush Life Jumbo Cocktail Shaker it appeared to be new (shiny, though there was a slight dent) but alas it too leaked. So back to square one to search for the leakless Jumbo Cocktail Shaker."
4,kiwi space-rock!,"bailter space is the first new zealand band i ever heard...bought their _wammo_ after hearing a song i really liked on a matador records compilation. this is supposed to be their masterpiece, but i can't really get into it. when i bought it, i was already in the thick of my kiwi rock obsession (i still am), and this just kinda pales in comparison to the really great first wave of kiwi underground acts, like the chills, the bats, the verlaines, and the clean. it's very spacey, very guitar-oriented, and deserves a few more listens. it's a good record, if a slight disappointment."
5,Tolkien would be proud,"I cannot think of any group who could do what the Brobdingnagian Bards do-that is, to capture the spirit of such a classic and record it. This album is a great addition to any Tolkien fan's library. If you are new to Tolkien, or spent hours a day travelling through Middle Earth again and again, you'll love this CD. I know I do! :)"
5,"the song ""The Fellowship of the Rings""","this song is by-far one of the best instrumentals I have ever heard..it is a very calming song that lifts you up and makes you smile...on a scale from 1 to 10,I rate it around 17...it has one of the sweetest recorders you'll ever hear being played...it would be an excellent song to play at a wedding..."
5,The lads' best yet!,"This CD is the Bard's best yet. This time the guys are playing it straight, no jokes, goof offs, or silliness. The songs are heart felt and wonderful. My favorite is the song of the Ents.This CD is where you really get to hear the lads as MUSICIANS.They were/are always great entertainers, but this is where their real musical talent comes to the fore. Great harmony, great folk art, and melody. Buy This!!"
1,Stupid,"I was very disappointed. The one star I gave it is for the instrumental with the recorder, it was good. I thought the rest was a very poor tribute to LOTR."
5,Excellent history of Southeast Kansas,"Being a resident of Southeast Kansas, I really enjoyed this book. It told tales that were very interesting and fun to read. This book should be mandatory for all Southeast Kansans!!"
4,good rythmn throughout,With their first hit 'SHINE' they just keep putting out better music every album.
5,COLLECTIVE SOUL: YOU BLOW ME AWAY!!,Every song is great! That's what I can't get over. It's so hard to find a CD these days which you can just put on and let it play without becoming annoyed. I can't believe it took me this long to discover these guys. I LOVE this music!! I'm still kicking myself that I'm only now getting into this band.
3,Great CD But the Sound Quality Stinks,It's a shame...This is a great CD but the sound quality stinks. I have to really turn it up in order to get decent sound. I'm hoping they remaster this CD.
2,"Single ""Shine"" is only reason to buy this boring album!","I've heard a lot of CS on the radio lately since the dosage tour was anounced to hit Amarillo. But when I thought of Collective Soul, I thought of good guitars and interesting effects, and Hints has all of these except all of the songs are slow and sound the same, I litterally had trouble telling where 1 song ended and 1 began!"
2,"Out of Disc Player, Out of Mind","Having thought ""Shine"" was pretty catchy, I picked this up with hight hopes. Not long thereafter I was sick of ""Shine,"" and this disc's value went to about zero. This isn't really bad music, I suppose, it's just completely unmemorable and bland. Once I was done listening to it, nothing lingered, almost nothing struck me as original or exciting in the least. ""Scream"" isn't a bad little rocker, and ""Wasting Time"" is fair enough southern pop, but I can't even recall what any other songs sounded like.I sold this disc for $3 to a local used shop, and have never missed it once. If you value daring and unpredictability in your music, put your money elsewhere."
5,great happy grunge album,"This album is my all time favorite and my most used cassett tape! It is collective souls first album and won't dissapoint you. In this album there is an excellent blend of calm soul seaching and comforting songs with turn up the volume and dance your heart out rock/grunge songs. Ross Childress (their lead guitarist) does an outstanding job on songs like ""shine"" and ""all"" and Ed's songwriting skills and lyrical meaning are beyond compare. I recomend that you buy this album before you buy any other albums by them. This one gives you a great intoduction to who they were in the begginging... 5 really talented, naturally gifted, flannel wearing, and long haired young men."
4,great debut album,I bought this album after I had the Collective Soul album. This one is better than the second and even the third. If you like Collective Soul I would HIGHLY recommend buying this one. It's worth it!
2,"Unorganized, but full of promise","I actually heard ""Shine"" as early as November,1993 about 4 months before this album came out. I guess it pays to live down south. I found ""Shine"" to be a thought provoking song; don't ask me why. I heard the other song ""Breathe"" a few months later, and the direction is as different as night and day. ""Breathe"" is techno-pop that sounds like what Nine Inch Nails would've sounded like if they came out of Georgia like Collective Soul does, but ""Shine"" is a good piece of Southern Alternative. Other songs noteworthy are: ""Burning Bridges"", and ""All"". The rest is all over the map which to me is not a good thing as a group should start out with an identity to let the public know what they're all about, but with Collective Soul the style of music matches the title name of this album: ""Hints Allegations, and Things Left Unsaid."" They tried to cram too much into an album that wasn't necessary to have in there. They do get better trust me."
5,Excellent!,"This is a super c.d. It contains a variety of songs that showcases the talent of this band. This is not for the hard rock fan. In my opinion, it is by far the best work this band has ever done."
5,Great Album,Well I would have to say that this is the album that got me hooked me on Collective Soul. This one hasnt left my cd player for quite a while. There isn't a song on this cd that dont like. I recommend this cd to all Collective Soul fans!
4,one of my faves,Excellent Collective Soul CD. Their best CD by far. Love is in the water love is in the air yeah...
2,OK printer that consumes way too much ink,"I bought this about two years ago, and was quite satisfied with the print quality. Using photo ink and glossy paper, it produced some beautiful pictures. Unfortunately, the amount of ink it consumes makes it very uneconomical. After spending about $75 on two cartridges, and having them run dry after only a few sheets, I gave up.Although I still have the printer, it's ink dried up months ago and I don't plan on buying any more. It's more cost effective to burn my pictures to a CD and take them to Walgreens for developing."
3,Speed is not true,"Lexmark says that Z43 can print 12ppm black & 6ppm color. This is only for attraction. I found it prints 2ppm black, if it is full page. When I asked for technical support, they explained to me, that 12ppm is for the page, filled no more then 5%! (almost empty!) and quality 300x300 (normal is 600x600). But quality of printed page is good (for 600x600) and is even better for 2400x1200. In this case you have to wait one page several minutes!"
3,Remember the cartridge costs,"I bought this printer a couple of months ago because of the price. The resolution is great, and with the ""photo"" cartrige and glossy paper, photos come out looking almost as good as at the developer. But I have discovered that the cartridges have a short life, only 600 pages, and cost [money](new, cheaper if refurbished) to replace. If you print more than 50-100 pages a month, you'll be better off shelling out a bit more for HP."
1,Not XP compatible!,"This printer worked fine for Windows ME, but once we upgraded to XP the printer started acting up. It would stop & error out half way into a print job, and for photos it would dump so much ink on the paper that it would look horrible and embarrassing. However, we just upgraded to the Lexmark Z45, and it works WONDERFUL with XP. Just FYI for those Windows XP users looking for a printer."
3,blown away by the print quality,"My epson 740 died yesterday and i needed to replace it fast. i went out and bought a new printer today. i picked the lexmark z43 only because it was on sale and seemed to have decent specs for the money. the print quality is stunning but the speed is no where near 12ppm. (i knew that going in, but i find it annoying that printer companies all use the same partial truth to sell their wares) it's prety quiet, much more so than the old 740, though it does start with a loudish jolt. as a piece of furniture it's butt ugly. that's a pity cause it doesn't have to be. (this is according to my tastes of course) i'd give it five stars based on print quality but it lost a couple of points cause of it's manipulative sales ploy about print speed and because it's an eye sore."
3,"Succint, useful history","The two greatest attributes of Kirkwood's History of Mexico are its brevity and readability. Roughly the length of a long novel, it makes for a quick and easy read for those traveling to Mexico or just interested in its basic history. It is short on cultural movements and longer on the military and economic evolution of the country. Like the editorial reviewer above, I wish Kirkwood would have dedicated significantly more room (and more facts) to present-day issues, such as immigration, the NAFTA, the peso bailout and the achievements and failures of the Fox administration. Still, the book provides a good, short, readable background on Mexican history for English speakers with limited basic knowledge of the country's history."
3,An adequate book,The concept of having the theory of presentations separated from the practice in the two separate halves of the book did not really work for me. I would have liked the book to be about PowerPoint and only PowerPoint from start to finish.
5,Community Planning a MUST have for college student planners,We used this text in our planning course last fall and it was excellent! Eric Kelly is a genius when it comes to writing planning books. This book is a must have for all college planning students. I highly recommend it!
5,Nick Dean's Book on Snow Squall,"Nick Dean, the author of the book, Snow Squall: The Last American Clipper Ship, offers an impassioned study of the history of the great seafaring clipper Ship christened SNOW SQUALL and the long, vigorous tradition of the American navigational culture that once marked the oceans surrounding the new Republic. The book tells a deft and focused story of the heroic ship and its seasoned crews with an expertise of a naval historian, photographer and artist, the author's alter ego."
4,"My Niece, A Teacher, Really Likes It!","I send my oldest niece, a teacher in Florida, books based on a theme they have each year. This book follows their current theme, learning about animals, predators and prey. She really likes this book."
1,Horrible Letdown,"If you're in the mood to completely waste $25, go ahead and buy this book. There's free online documentation and help files that blow this book out of the water; search for help elsewhere if you want to have any idea how to use Matlab."
5,A really good genuinely quick introduction to Matlab.,"I am biased. I know this book and the author well. But! I have seen literally hundreds of students at Cornell get started with Matlab with relatively little pain using this book. It starts with simple tutorials. Four hours with these and you can actually do useful things in Matlab. The later material is a good intro and a good reference. The book is not made for a Matlab course but for a person who wants/needs to use Matlab for their work or courses. This is a book that can wean some students of their calculators and begin using a much more powerful tool. It is a book that can coax some who use Fortran, Basic, or C++ into using an equally powerful but easier to use tool."
1,Worst stats software book I've seen,"The only redeeming value to this book is the author (genuinely?) tries to be helpful to the beginner, but fails in this effort. The examples are trivial, the organization poor, and after reading it neither my partner nor I could say we learned Matlab. We ended up playing with Matlab's built-in demo (use the ""demo"" command) to learn it. We both think this is the worst stats software book we've read.If you are a total Matlab newbie and can find a copy of this book in the library, read it. Otherwise check out other books, or just use the Matlab demo."
4,For mellow piano listeners,"Pandolfi CDs are tops for listening to relaxing, mellow, retro type piano music...He is among my favorites."
3,A pleasant hot sauce,"For quite some time, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food. Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches. Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others. It has a good flavor and is neither too hot nor too mild. This is a product that I can recommend."
3,Great product.,"The product is great, I used to get it at Wal-Mart...but they quit selling it. Shipping and handling is twice as much as the product - that kind of annoys me, but I ordered anyway."
5,A very good alternative to Cholula,"This is a great Mexican hot sauce. It's very cheap at Walmart. It tastes similar to Cholula hot sauce, which is much more expensive. It does not taste like Frank's Red Hot. I dunno what's up with that reviewer's taste buds. It has a slight chipolte pepper taste and is darker red compared to Cholula.Overall: highly recommended."
5,good stuff,"I copied this from a post I wrote on my blog a while back. I only changed the price to XX.This has become my preferred hot sauce. I had never heard of the brand before but saw it on the shelf at WalMart maybe a year ago and bought a small bottle to try. I really like it so it is now what I use mostly as hot sauce, several times a day usually. It comes in regular and extra hot. I have tried both and prefer the extra hot, although it is not that hot. It is about right for me. I go through a bottle or 2 a month.Ingredients: Water, Chili Peppers, Vinegar, Salt, Spices, 0.1% sodium benzoate as a preservative.As an added bonus, the 1 liter bottles are <$XX. Made in Mexico. it comes in a smaller bottle as well, but I get the 1 liter size. I have one at work and one at home."
4,Super sound but sometimes boring,"This album includes many techno hits, which I like to hear. They have the best groove and you can dance very well! Some of the songs are boring and so you have much work while hearing it!"
4,whistling cat tea kettle,"this kettle looks exactly right for a cat lover. However the whistle noise sounds like a very mournful cow mooing! Great fun to have, but the noise might depress the owners. Love the design but need to fix the sound.Norma T."
2,Cat Tea Kettle,The whistle on this poor cat sounds as if it has spent about 8 of its 9 lives. It makes noise when the water boils but whistle is stretching it a bit.
3,Great quality...just too tight..,I ordered a size that I thought was appropiate but they are too tight. I think the quality is very high...better than what I usually buy at Walmart. But it is so tight against my lower legs. I need to order larger size. GREAT Quality in material..
5,Great Socks!,My husband says these are the best socks he's worn in years. They are thick and absorbant. Only a few pair have been through the wash but I don't think these socks are going to stretch out of shape. I'll be buying these again.
1,Not the socks pictured,These are not the socks advertised in the picture. They are much thinner version. I would not recommend given its price.
1,Bait & Switch ... Not the socks in the picture !,"I didn't receive the Champion Elite socks in the picture. Instead, receive a thinner less decorated version of the sock. I'm sort of feeling ripped off."
5,They go on my feet,"I wear these on my feet. They make walking more comfortable, and people don't look at me funny any more because I'm not wearing socks."
5,The most Anointed Video you will ever see!,"The concert was Superior! I especially loved the little vinyettes about his family. The choir was superb. Monique Walker, his wife ministering in song touch the depth of my soul. When ever I have a family gathering,my family always request this video. My church choir has song every song on this video. I have never seen anyone direct a choir like Hezekiah Walker. I can go on and on about this video, it just amazing. I give God glory every time I watch it. Everybodys performance was pure exellence God Bless You all. Please continue to love one another in Jesus Name."
4,"Great Follow Up Album, An Essential Album For Fans Of 80s And Early 90s Rock","You can tell the band hit the ground running on their second offering. It's a powerful album, featuring quite a few good songs. The recording quality has improved as well. Still, there's something about their first album, and their earlier works from Germany, that speak to me on a deeper level. If you're into 80s rock laced with a little synth, or early 90s rock, this album should definitely be added to your collection."
1,Bad Pronunciation!,"I am Chinese-American. I speak Cantonese at home, but am looking for a book to move to the next level.I looked at the pronunciation in this book, and it is horrible. You will automatically sound horrible. i.e. ""I"" is spelled out as ""Or"". No word in Cantonese ends with a ""R"" sound.You will sound like an idiot because of all these ""R"" sounds in your speech.I recommend you buy something with Audio so you can hear how basic words like ""I"" should be pronounced."
2,"Solid case, lacking features.","The physical design of the aluminum case is the best I've seen, though it uses an external power supply which I dislike as it adds significant clutter under the desk, and limits portability.My real issue with the product however is that there is no power switch, nor any means of spinning down the hard disk other than pulling the power plug. I contacted MacAlly tech support and they suggested I power the unit through a switchable power strip. They also confirmed that the drive can't be spin down through software, such as OSX's energy saver control panel. Frankly, there is no excuse for omitting such a simple, and inexpensive, feature from a rather pricey product. I will be returning the product.Add a power switch, + 2 stars.Move the power supply inside the case, +1 star.In the cases defense, the LED read/write/power indicator looks awesome!"
5,exactly what i needed,"great for anyone with an extra drive kicking around, also alot cheaper than pre-assembled drives (even including buying a new one). the only thing to keep in mind is that you NEED to have the drive's jumpers in master mode, as the enclosure isn't capable of cable-select."
2,FireWire was defective on mine,"I bought it, and USB was fine, but the FireWire ports didn't work. Lost time and money sending it in for warranty service."
5,"Nice enclouses, but keep them ventelated.","These enclosures do a great job at keeping the drives cool. I have four of them stacked on top of each other, but the enclosures were getting almost too hot to touch. I've added some spacers between the drives to allow for air to circulate between them and they are much cooler.If you leave the your drives on all of the time and plan on sleeping in the same room, forget it. The blue LED on the front is blindingly bright at night, let alone having four of them.I use the enclosures with drives I use for video editing and have not had one fail yet. (knock on wood). The power supplies are inline and have regular plugs on the end, meaning you have no wall-warts to deal with."
1,bad news...,"According to Macally tech support, this enclosure requires a more-powerful external power supply to operate properly with large-capacity hard drives (300GB or more) customers are required to return the original power supply at their own expense (!!!) and wait nearly a month before receiving the replacement.."
2,Not well thought out,"Do NOT buy two of these. You can not use them together. Also, hard drives will never spin down when idle - which means your drives will die much quicker unless you manually turn the drive on and off every time you need it."
2,Really isnt universal,Last timne I checked universal meant almost every product.This head will not fit any trimmer that requires a smaller diameter thread.Not sure why they couldnt include ( for the hefty price they are charging) a simple one bolt adapter that would truly make this universal.Instead it fits a very very narrow band of products that it lists.
4,Right price,Received the item in the mail quickly. Struggled to find the part in the store since husqvarna makes repair places be dealers....
3,Universal trimmer head - sort of...,"Bought this for use with a John Deere gas powered trimmer. Supposedly this trimmer was built by Husqvarna .. but appearently not. It is supposed to be a universal head. While it had one left-hand thread adapter, it did not have the one to fit my trimmer. Would have been nice to know befor I bought but I couldn't tell from the item description what adapters it didi and didn't have, nor was there a cross-reference to see if would fit my specific trimmer. I was able to adapt it with a drill, a torch and spare parts fromt he old head.It appears to be a generally a well designed head. It is better built than some I have bought in the past. No idea how durable it will be at this stage..."
2,description of toy is not correct...,Product DescriptionLittle ones will have hours of fun riding with George. This bright red wooden car features rubber wheels and Curious George is in the drivers seat.NO RUBBER WHEELS...
5,Great little toy,I got this for my 2 year old grandson to go along with a Curious George book I also got him for Christmas. The toy is actually better constructed than I thought it would be. He immediately recognized George and enjoys playing with the toy along with his other cars.
1,Schnell is either delusional or a ..... artist.,"It took me about 15 minutes of reading to realize this book is contrived nonsense. Just another huckster trying to exploit the ""new age"" trend. If you want to read better new age fakery try Carlos Castenada - at least he did some research in the library."
1,"Can you say ""contrived?""","This book appears to be a poorly disguised attempt to win followers among the feeble minded. From reading the reviews it seems he's already made a few. They must provide a nice steady income stream for the author.It took about 3 pages into this book to realize it's only chicanery, snake oil and/or some whacko's fantasy. It sounds like a cult in the making. Steer clear."
4,"Intersting , information, serous claims","I was giveing the initiation by a friend who found much delight in the book and the company of the authur and his wife. I read the book and met the authur. I am not as swept away as my frined but I will say the book has some intersting information, true or false, I can not know, but I had a lot of fun reading the book."
1,Hopeless Book,"I bought this book after I read so many glowing recommendations, but when I stated reading reading this book , I realized that it was a hopeless book. Somehow I managed to read the whole book ( because I had spent some hard earned money in buying it) . The author says that as per Authobiography of a Yogi, Mahavatar Babji was initiated by Lord Krishna. This is absolutely wrong, Paramhansa Yogananda never wrote such things in his Autobiography. Besides the author Dr Donald Schnell had shown Mahavatar Babaji speaking english very poorly. This is unpalatable to any literary or spiritual taste. Besides that, Dr Schnell talks more of his wife than he talks about his so called Babji. In a nut shell, the kind of spiritual vibrations and compassion I feel in reading books of Yogananda, they were completely missing in this book ""The Initiation"" by Dr Schnell.I did not enjoy reading this book and I will NOT recommend this book."
4,"Great Bread, wrong recipe","To whom it may concern:Traditionally Irish Soda Bread did not contain Raisins because it was essentially a bread that our ancestors consumed daily with often each meal. It was not until the recipe was passed down generations that the added raisins were apart of the Irish Bread recipe. Back in the early 1500-1700's raisins were not available, but during the harsh winters, Irish women began placing raisins in the Irish soda bread as added fullfillment and began using it as more of a breakfast or mid evening snack with a small cup of hot tea.My family is deep rooted with the Irish Soda bread recipe, as is your recipe which I think is great and it is what you are accustomed to, traditionally Irish Soda Bread did not have raisins in it.Thanks for sharing your recipe with us.Susan"
4,perfect fit,I ordered this battery for my husband's cell phone. We received it in a timely fashion and it has been working great. Thanks.
2,Mixed review,This was a starter set for Nokia 3120. The auto and home plug in chargers are fine. The earphone is the pits. The sound quality was poor and the plug broke on 2nd use. Very poor design and poor quality plastic plug.
2,"Cover and Charger fine, headset useless","The phone cover and charger in this kit are perfectly fine, however the headset included is terrible. The cord between the phone and earpiece is far too short and the only comfortable place to have your phone is in your shirt pocket, or holding it close to your chest."
2,Too Many Outsiders,"Record Companies fear that having just one artist on a CD will fail to sell so they pack in all sorts of other people to try to appeal to customers. Look at Telarc's Cincinnati Orchestra Xmas CDs to find glaring examples. So here we have Roger Whittaker singing with Boyd a new song that is about as feeble as possible, lame words and even lamer music, totally unoriginal and derivative that sounds like it was cobbled together in a ten minute session and I am being generous. Then we add an adult choir and a children's choir and a child soloist and the skimpy 40 minute CD leaves little room for Boyd's guitar so I advise classical guitar devotees to skip this CD and I advise Boyd to get a new producer."
4,Incredible,"This is one of those rare, forgotten gems of history. Mundy's book on South African foreign policy making is as relevant today as it was when it was published 50 years ago. This American scholar in roughly 100 pages captures a country's history in a captivating, concise way that leaves a reader awed and wanting more."
3,Connector cracked when stepped on,Connector is very brittle and will crack when stepped on. This causes a leak or breaks loose altogether. Not good.
3,"good, but not perfect","This swivel does what it says it will, but that is as far as it goes.The material it is made of is too hard, hurting the foot if one doesn't have hard soled shoes onIt does not solve the basic problem of the oxygen cord trying to twist back into a coil."
4,Good for everyday photos,"I just bought this paper from elsewhere, and am quite happy with it for printing digital photos for sharing. My mom has tried Kodak and HP paper and was really impressed with the photos I showed her with this paper (she has a better printer than I do). The paper has a slight texture, but not as ""fine"" as the the texture I got from 35mm processing.The paper is 4"" x 6"". Our printer does not support borderless printing, so our photos have a small border on all sides. There are no edges or tabs to tear off.The paper has a decent weight to it, being slightly thicker than the everyday photo paper from HP. Since I don't remember seeing it in the product description, the specs are:4"" x 6""52 lb9.4 mill96% opacity99 ISO brightness"
3,mediocre,good musicians come together to make some decent music. nothing ground breaking by any means. may collect dust after a few listens.
1,Poorly written problems,Lots of missing information and assumptions plague the problems that are found at the end of the chapters. A very difficult book to understand.
3,Operations Management with Student DVD and Power Web,The book has clear objectives and great examples. The DVD is an excellent addition to the book as well.
2,NOT as GOOD as the LATER CD'S from B-TRIBE!!!,I was DISAPPOINTED in this CD because it LACKED the COMPLEX TONES of B-TRIBE'S other CD'S!!!!!!!!!!! I have ALL the CD'S from B-TRIBE!
5,ANYTHING BY B-TRIBE IS OUT OF THIS WORLD,They get better with each CD but they are still all out of this world. There are no words to describe what this music does--chills and thrills.
3,Good but not the best B-Tribe,"I really love B-Tribe, but personally this is my last choice among the three albums. In my opinion, the male vocals on this one severely detract from what could have been a much better blend.I'd recommend starting with Suave Suave and going from there!"
5,This is a great printer. Period.,"I was reading the other reviews and the thought ""this must be the person's first inkjet printer"" came to mind. ALL printer makers overcharge for ink. Duh! I have no problem using generic ink ($8 black/$10 color) in my Z53, and the photo quality from it is unmatched. Low quality mode is a little TOO low quality, but the 360x360 and higher printer modes are outstanding. You can't do better than this printer (this is my 4th one), especially for this price. Trust me."
2,paper doesn't feed down staight,"good printer if you don't mind that the paper doesn't feed down correctly. No matter what I do, the paper feeds on a slight angle. I have a lexmark laser at work, that one works flawlessly but this inkjet has some problems.."
5,Excellent for my small business,"We are extremely satisfied. We own a small private school, and use our Lexmark Z53 for printing our handbooks, fliers, and newsletters, some of which have color photos. It's fast, reliable, and prints even the photos fine enough to be proud to send out. (And we do not use actual photo grade paper or ink, which would improve the quality more.) I never tried to print banners or booklets with my XP operating system, so I can't comment about those jobs. The ink is pricey, but doesn't seem out of line with the industry, and it's a lot cheaper than going to a printer. One last note: we never run large jobs because we're a small school, so I can't comment on how it would hold up under heavy daily use."
1,Too difficult to print photos!,"I bought this printer on the recommendation of the Lexmark sales rep.Setup was a breeze with Windows XP. The test page printed with no problems and a Word document also was hassle free.Photos are a different story! I spent 4 hours trying to get a digital photo to print correctly, all to no avail! They either made it look like I took a picture of Stretch Armstrong or were so distorted as to be unrecognizable. I even had one picture come out approximately 1"" wide x 4"" long!!! All of this was done with software provided with the printer for ""ease of use"".This dog went back to (retail location) the next morning to be exchanged for an HP 1115."
1,this thing sucks,I bought this printer and got two good prints out of it before it broke. It got good reviews from industry magazines but was nothing but a huge dissapointment and wast of time for me. Then on top of that I had to spend another $$ to send the peice of junk back.
4,New Haven Reporter Solves Crimes,"This is the first mystery that I read by Karen E. Olson and I became a fan. This book, based in New Haven CT, is a funny, fast paced mystery that introduced me to Annie Seymour, a reporter for a New Haven newspaper who solves the crimes she reports on. If you like gutsy women who survive romantic disasters, problems with bosses, and criminal elements, you'll love this book. You can believe that a woman like Annie Seymour actually exists and you root for her character as she dodges those who would rather see her dead. Much Like Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum, Karen E. Olson's Annie Seymour is a feisty, lovably flawed female who's next adventure you can't wait to read."
4,unholy murder afoot,"Rebeccasreads recommends SACRED COWS as a rip-snortin' debut noir mystery, liberally peppered with dark humor & evil intent.Annie Seymour is one flawed heroine: rough, brash & given to excesses, however, she's as tenacious at getting to the truth as a Bull Dog is intent on your ankle, & about as lovable!"
1,Absolutly Awful,"I picked this one up for a song at a Going out of business sale, so thank God I wasn't too disappointed.The acting is poor, the script is even worse. I will probably give it to my nephew who is gaga over Korean Chicks."
2,"Not romantic, not porn, so what is this?",I think the title tells you everything. I couldn't understand what the producers want to say on this movie. It is a collage of unrelated pieces just to fill the two hours of film.
2,Below Average remake of Indian classic,"This is a below average remake of the old indian classic ""Hare Krishna, Hare Rama"" which is much more poignant and adorned with beautiful music as well. Even if you don't know Hindi, get a DVD with English subtitles. It will be worth it. This movie has taken a story which can have a lot more depth and can offer a lot more experiences and turned it into clockwork."
1,from Solo Piano Publications,"""Awakenings"", follows the same formula as ""Inner Voices"" with an opening theme usually in the middle register of the piano, and then repeating it up an octave, coming back down and repeating again, and then repeating again in the upper octave. Then a new theme is introduced and given the same treatment. Most of the themes are very nice and show promise, but they never go anywhere. This happens on every song on the CD. I find that I can't listen to any of the songs all the way through anymore as they annoy me with the predictable repetitions. I understand that Asbjornson's music is often used for massage, and it would certainly lull someone into a nap! Personally, I'd have to ask them to change the music! Asbjornson's playing is competent and his themes are nice, but nothing develops.Very disappointing."
4,Great read,"If you enjoy history and are fascinated by Lincoln, this is a great addition to your library"
2,It has poor contents and and is not up-to-date,"Not for someone looking for advanced techniques building a real game. He wastes a lot of pages talking about how games can be done, but not in technical ways. If you want to learn Java, buy a book intended to teach you Java from beginning. This is not organised with this purpose. I believe it's not organised in anyway."
1,don't recommend,The whole point of this product is to STORE the toys in the bag on the WALL so that they aren't in the way. This bag is useless to me because it won't stick on the wall. I have smooth tiles. I tried cleaning the walls and the suction cups with alcohol - nothing works. The suction cups are small and very flimsey - cheaply made. It falls down even with nothing in it. A total waste of my time and money. I am still searching high and low for a bag with better suction cups.
1,"Horrible organizer, keep looking","I have had several tub organizers and this is by far the worst. It doesn't hold anything up as previously mentioned AND things get moldy due to the seam on the bottom. After pulling out the toys and cleaning them one by one twice a week I finally had to throw most of them out, unable to keep up with whatever kind of mold could be lerking. Bottom line save your money and keep looking!"
2,I wish I would have known,"I wish I would have read the reviews before buying this bag. I haven't had many problems with Sassy so I thought this would be great. Little did I know how bad the suction cups were. The first few times I hung it up, it didn't stay. I was so angry, I almost sent it back. Luckily, the last time I hung it, it stuck. My son doesn't play with it at all. The only person who likes it is my husband -- he doesn't step on all the toys when he gets into the shower any more."
2,cheap stiching work,"Feels like a good bag for my purposes, only thing is the stiching in one pocket came apart after only one use. Now I have to figure a way to fix it. Think next time I buy a military bag, will go to a real Surplus store and get the real thing. I should know what one feels and works like spent 20 years in the military."
2,"Burn, burn, i want to burn!","Don't buy this computer until they start shipping them with internal cd and/or DVD burners! yes, you can always add an external one to it, but why waste your money on something that will soon be intigrated with the computer?! If you really need a laptop, buy the ibook instead. It might be a tad slower but at least you can back up your data without having to buy anything axtra (except maybe a CD)."
5,"Finally, A Book That Goes Beyond The Norm...","Ride the Ark Through Armageddon has a lot to say! If a person reads it and parallels it with the Scriptures they will learn much. The background of creation and the falling of Satan; how he envied humanity and set out to destroy it; what he did to the world with deception and why we live in such a fallen world today, are questions we all want and need to know. This book sheds light to those questions.To sum things up, this book was a blessing to me and shed light to a number of questions that the Bible arises. It all made sense and came together very well. It was easy to read and understand due to the breaking down of the Hebrew language and definitions. It flowed well with titled sections and small chapters. I never needed a dictionary:)I LOVE THIS BOOK!"
3,A Survival Guide In The Last Days,"I have no doubt Author Rich Kelsey is a Christian; there are areas of his book I enjoyed, but his theology is in error in many areas, the most glaring error comes from his belief that the two witnesses in Jerusalem, may represent a worldwide assembly of men. With the overwhelming information that leads to just two witnesses, I seriously question his understanding of Revelation all together. If you are a seeker of none literal theology, buy this book."
3,Can be better,"The VidPro Accessories Camera CAse is good but it should be water proof;the material and zip should be in such a way, if rain fall the camera inside should not get wet. The two (2) holes at the top should be at the bottom instead."
2,Lots of Fluff,"Out of 244 pages, only about 20 of them deal with valuation calculation. Most of the book is basic accounting vocabulary. The sections dealing with valuation don't leave you thinking that you could actually put together a reasonable estimate of business value, and most of the valuation models require the use of a very subjectively computed Risk Price Multiple (RPM). Some good information, but overall I would recommend seeking an another resource."
1,Book like this harm the industry,"very poor book. Evaluation is wrong, according to this method companies will be overpriced by at least 50%. Example in the book is very bad - company which make 13000 per year cash flow plus 18000 owner's salary (my 18 years old girl make more than that) can not worst 180000 dollars, I doubt that it worst 50000. Plus author even doesn't know what is FREE CASH FLOW mean (high school economics).Books like this harm the industry because set unrealistic expectation and businesses stuck in listing for years and never will be sold"
5,Masculine smell,"This fragrance it's not for a 15 years old cause it's too serious and too manly, smell great for 30+ man."
4,A Gentle Introduction to Multivariate Analysis,"This book is provides a gentle introduction to the field of Multivariate analysis. The author provides a ground up introduction to each of the topic. Each chapter starts off with a relatively simple example to introduce the topic.However, there are not many solved examples,which i feel is the basic shortcoming of this book. I would advice on obtaining a second book on this topic for additional examples and explanations."
3,Can Anyone tell me if this cd is of the live versions,Hi I want to know from someone that has this are these the live versions of the songs from the grammy appearences.Like is Whitneys version live.
3,a must for diehard west fans,This album is a must for diehard fans. But it will probably only have limited appeal for those that are not Leslie fanatics.
5,Classy,I like the design. The single-handle makes it easy to turn off with soapy hands using your wrist. The installation was very simple with ordinary household tools. The hexagon key was provided to tighten the handle. The only thing I needed to buy was caulking for sealant. The instructions tell you what you need. My wife loves it.
5,Awsome Book,"I love this book. The art work is OKAY, not the best, but it fits the story well. Momoko is a sweet lolita, not a gothic lolita. There is a BIG difference. Ichigo(AKA Ichiko) is a yanki, who seems a bit clueless at times. There are some pretty big differences between the movie, then novel, and the manga, so try not to get too confused if you own all three! This book also includes 2 bonus stories, ""The Pinky Finger Princess"", and ""The Middle Finger Princess"". My favortie of the two is ""The Middle Finger Princess"", which might not be suitable for younger readers. There's some cursing in this book, but probably not as much as there is in the origional novel, so I reccomend this book for younger readers, as a substitute until they can handle the language."
5,Lifestyle Lolita,"I love this book! It is written in a whimsical view from Momoko, a lolita. I think it would be most enjoyable for lolitas, but other people may like it, too. It has a certain level of craziness that makes it fun, but real enough to be believable"
5,Very good book,"This book is one of my new favs. It's a great story, and it made me smile. It's a bit diffrent from the movie, (the ending) but it will make you laugh."
3,a plate of red herrings,"a steel rod made of steel easily penetrates the brain.another matchless , full of blue-ribbon entertainment of mystery"
4,"Smooth and bluesy rock, it is the music for road trip...","Compare to their live performace, especially for their guitar performance, this band is much more versatile than this album shown, but as the first album, ""Lonely Road"" presents perfectly the concept of this band, a smooth and bluesy rock style music. All the tracks in this album remain the consistent and integrated quality of music. As the album title, this is a nice music for your own road trip.Similiar Artist: EaglesRecommend Track: Ride with Me, Don't Mean a Thing to Me, Don't Be Shy"
5,The best book I've read in a long while...,"I think this book was *great*! I enjoyed every single minute of it, and I have to say I probably was in lust with Daegus from the first few pages. There are some great, steamy sex scenes, you feel like the characters really care about each other - I can almost *see* Daegus in front of me. It was just a wonderful read.Even though I'd read Ms. Moning's other books, and had enjoyed them immensely, and waited for this one *very* impatiently, this one exceeded my expectations, by far. I have to say, run, don't walk, to the nearest store, and pick up a copy.Some of the characters from the previous book are brought back, briefly, and it was nice to see them again. However, I would like to see more of Adam, and I can't wait until she writes more about him.Please, Ms. Moning, keep up the good work - and I'll keep on buying them!"
5,Her best book yet!,This is her best book yet and I didn't want it to end. The characters were interesting and intelligent. I can't wait for her next book. This book is definitely a keeper.
2,"Not as good as ""Kiss of the Highlander""","The heroine was weaker I felt in this book. I found myself frustrated with her whereas I had more respect for Gwen in the Kiss of the Highlander. It was terrible that Silvan tells Daegus that he's the favorite over Drustan, no father would say that to one of twin sons. And the whole story about a tortured hero who can be saved only by the one mate, and uttering a binding spell was shamelessly unoriginal and imitative of Christine Feehan's ""Dark"" series... Otherwise he will become ""a dark one"" and lose his soul, again just like Feehan's series.Easy ending, too easy. No good twists like Kiss of the Highlander.I don't know if I'll bother with the next one, Highlander's Touch."
5,Always a 'Keeper' Writer,"Karen Marie Moning has that 'certain something' in her writing that romance readers keep reading romance for. She brings two-dimensional characters to life through the power of her language and her understanding of emotion, and most importantly Moning knows what it is that reader's want in her hero.I would say that Dageus is my favorite hero, but that would be a lie, each of her Heros is my favorite when I read her work. ""The Dark Highlander"" is the most erotically charged of her novels and I enjoyed it greatly. My only complaint, which is one I have with every book I really enjoy, is that I wish it were longer."
5,You won't be able to put this book down,"Sexy, sexy book. Great story, funny to boot, and impossible to put down."
5,A Great Read,This is one of Karen M. Monings' best yet. It's rich in detail and all the senses get a treat. It is extremely impossible to stop reading. This is a great one for people who haven't read Karen Moning before.
2,Dissapointed with this one...,"In this book about Adam Black, I found myself dissapointed and surprised by the lack of consistency of Adam's character compared to the other Highlander books that he appeared in. He was positively horrid in the past books and down right hateable. I felt that his character as that hateable fairy added to the last books and made you understand why is son didn't want anything much to do with him in ""The Highlander's Touch"". His lightening fast change of character in this book was just too unbelievable to me. I couldn't even finish due to the fact that it just wasn't even ficticiously believable as Moning's past books have been. Oh well, you can't please everyone. I'm glad that someone enjoyed it. I do look forward to more about the MacKeltar brothers in the future. Pleas don't wait to long to pick up the Highlander series again, Ms. Moning. Thanks!"
1,Complete[ly] [Weak],"How Karen Marie Moning has the courage to put her photo on the back flap of this book, I will never know. To be willingly identified as the author of such [stuff] is brave indeed.[Cheap thrills] disguised as romantic fiction is an old genre, and this book does not pretend to be anything else, but it is arousing only if your idea of a desirable male is defined solely by arrogance and physicality. Knowing that there are women who feel lust for the fictional Daegus MacKeltar makes me ashamed to be a woman.The writing is shallow, the storyline is shallow, the characterization is shallow. I would give it 0 stars out of 5, but Amazon.com doesn't allow ratings that low."
5,<sigh> Can I have a Daegus of my Own?,An excellent timetravel romance. However read Kiss of the Highlander before this one. You won't be disappointed with either one.
3,Not as good as the others...,"First, the good: I really liked the nobleness and uprightness of character in Daegus. Chloe was also a character to love. Sweet, honest, but never annoying.The best part of the book was after they left for Scotland. I loved reading about all THEY were reading, in the ancient books, and that she brought Gwen & Drustan into the story.Now, the bad: this was hardly a romance book. It is definitely, out of all the books of hers I've read so far, the one with the most sex in it. And there is the downfall for me. It's not that I don't like a well placed scene every now and then, but on almost every page it has something to do with sex or lust. Yes, I understand that some of that goes along with Daegus' character, however, at times I felt like I was reading Ms. Moning's personal sex fantasies, and that was the overkill."
5,Oh yeah baby!,"The plot has been well stated by other reviewers here so let me say-HOT D%*#!!! This book defines sexual tension! If you did that in a romance as well as a hero who isn't a jerk, GET THIS BOOK!!!It is really impressively good."
4,The Cover of the Book Was Better than the story,"Dagus, Mckelter, was a fine man, but the woman he fell in love with, NOT!!!! she was nothing like Drustan''s woman. Okay different women but did she have to be such an airhead. I really liked Adam and I liked his whole story. He was fun. I like the story just not the woman."
3,Could Have Been Better!,"The first book I read by this author was ""Kiss of the Highlander"" and it was a 5 star story. This book was my second one and gets 3 stars for the sizzling sex and the first 1/2 of the story. The last half of the story was boring and it took too long to achieve each event. This story could have been told in 275 pages instead of 369 and been much faster paced, which would have been better. I'll give this author credit for knowing how to write love/sex scenes and depict appreciation for both male and female bodies. And, her male heros are to die for. Just wish this story would have been better."
3,The best sort of brain candy.,"I don't really like time travel stories, either in Science Fiction or Romance. They always seem to have some sort of trick or cheat in the plot resolution. Despite that I started reading Ms. Moning's work because she is a local writer and a friend of a friend knew her and recommended her.Her books were a pleasant surprize. Sure there are the expected tricks in the story lines, but I was willing to overlook the time travel tricks because the plots and characters are engaging, and the sex scenes are hot, but not too over the top silly they way they are is so many Romance novels. Ok, maybe they are over the top silly, but they are so fun you don't care they if they are anatomicaly possible.This is the sort of book that can help you unwind and relax after a stressful day, and forget that you have a whole box of double stuff Oreos in the kitchen calling your name. It's brain candy, but it's brain candy of the best sort."
4,The Dark Highlander 5,"Great book. There seems to be a lot of the same ""talk"" through out the book but it is easilly skimmed over for me. I still recommend it"
5,Exceptional Book,"In her spectacular follow-up to Kiss of the Highlander, Karen Marie Moning delivers another enchanting romance. Breaking an ancient law to save his brother's life, Dageus MacKeltar is cursed by the possession of thirteen very evil and very powerful Druids. Desperate to end the curse before the thirteen take over his soul, Dageus will do anything to stop them.Cloe Zanders, antiquities addict and misplaced country girl, never expected to fall for a sexy, incredibly alluring, time-travelling, and unfortunately, possessed Druid. But she does. Together, the unlikely pair races to save not only Dageus, but also the rest of humankind from the wrath of the thirteen.Brilliantly witty, irresistibly sexy, and at times painfully tender, Karen Marie Moning delivers her strongest performance yet."
5,Another Brilliant Moning Tale,"While looking for great historical romance novels centered around the Irish and Scottish histories, I was lucky enough to stumble upon Karen's first book ""Beyond the Highland Mist"". That may have been one of the luckiest days of my life. I have been addicted to her books since the day I read the first and have awaited each new one that she writes. Every book that she writes is better than the one before and ""The Dark Highlander"" is absolutely no acception. As always Karen uses a great mix of reality and mythology. Her books are steamy and breathtakingly fabulous. Any book Karen writes is worth the money. Pick it up, and I promise you won't regret it!"
4,Loved it!,"Let me start with, I don't like romance novels. In fact, I bought this book by mistake. I am SOOOO glad I did! It was great! KMM is a great author! All the charcters are so vivid, I feel like i know them. I especially like that we hear from the male lead (Daegus). I'm usually annoyed by the ""mysterious"" male character, cause you never know his real motiviations (too much like in real life!). But here, you get to hear from Daegus' point of view on most situations, making the story all the more engrosing. I literally read the book in 2 days, and it only took me that long cause I was on vacation and had to do other things too. I loved it so much, I bought Kiss of the Higlander as soon as I got back. Even though I read them in reverse order, I was not confused, though I would recommend reading Kiss of the Highlander first, to truly appreciate how ""dark"" Daegus becomes. I highly recommend both!"
4,great,"like most other people who have reviewed this book, i loved it! It was wonderful! but it got one star knocked off because the author plugs one of her own books in this book! that hit me in the bad catigory! don't advertise another book in one already, and the way she did it was so false! but other than that it was wonderful."
5,Daegus comes out to play...darkly,"I have been skipping around these series as I have found the later ones to be better than the early ones. This novel did not disappoint me. I found the main character to be intriguing and tormented. Just like how we like a dark hero to be. I was not that drawn to Chloe and wish I could have felt more for her. As usual, the Scottish folk lore was tied nicely into the story, more so to me than the other books. I wish I could see more of these Druid powers instead Daegus surpressed everything most of the time. Overall, I love the series and will continue on the Immortal Highlander."
5,Lighter Touch of Dark,"Loved this 5th book in the series. Great story, lots of adventure and lots of romantic sexy times. I can't put these books down and read them in a days time. They are so entertining and spellbinding. Great read great writer!"
5,Love this book.,"I am not a reader of romance novels. I had always viewed them as nothing but sexual fluff with no thought in the world with dim witted unbelievable characters. To put it bluntly if you're not a very good writer, you could easily do romance novels. But...the first thing to catch my eye when I see this novel is this warrior surrounded in darkness. Darkness, hmm...this is a romance novel? Then when I skip pages and read little bits, I discover this writer has many interesting themes ranging from druidism, time-travel, guys with long black hair and settings from a luxury penthouse to the highlands of Scotland. I thought this book was absolutely well written with fascinating characters and subjects. I liked it so much, I hurried up and bought Kiss of the Highlander--Gwenn and Drustan's story. I would definitely highly recommend both books. It's an exciting escape!!!!"
4,Like it,"I love her characters. The MacKeltar twins fascinate and intrigue. Once Dageus, twin to Drustan discovered what real love was about, he didn't waver in his determination to keep it. His ability to love Chloe gives me faith in relationships. Hot and sexual!"
5,She's done it again,"We've all KNOWN that Karen Marie Moning is a WONDERFUL writer since her first book!! But just let me say that with Dark Highlander she WILL be moved into the realm of GREATNES!!! Each book has been better than the one before but I have NO IDEA how she will EVER top Daegus!!From beginning to end this book revolves around ROMANCE!! Both Daegus & Chloe realize that they are made for each other from first sighting & it just gets better from there! The feelings run deep & you are made privy to them ALL!! Karen takes us on a roller coaster ride, running the complete gambit of emotions, happy, sad, ecstatic, weeping, to just plain LOVING EVERYTHING about this book & the people (& they are people NOT characters) she has created!!! I NEVER wanted this book to end!! I plan on getting my own copy as soon as it's released (October 1) & reading it again!DON'T MISS THIS ONE!!!"
3,Heroine called herself a total dweeb...I agree,"Interesting idea but the heroine was far too goofy. Also, WAY too much repetitive inner-dialogue for the main characters and the ending was fairly lack-luster. Narrator Phil Gigante's male voices are perfect for this series, but his females are starting to sound too much alike."
3,Too advanced,"I purchased this book for my 3 year old after he got ""hooked on"" Caillou on PBS Sprout. It is a great storyline, but is obviously written by someone not used to writting for children (in my opinion). The descriptions in the book and wordiness make it seem for a much older crowd."
3,Ok but dated,"This book is ok. The information is a bit date on a lot of the stuff, but overall it can be a handy reference at a cheap price."
1,Not working,"It worked for about two weeks and now stopped charging or even powering. May have to send it back sincerity wasn't,the amount new product."
1,Lasted 3 1/2 months,"Although the power adapter is HUGE, I was just happy to have my laptop charging again. Unfortunately, without notice, it stopped working after 3 1/2 months. I'm now without my laptop and having to pay for another charger as this warranty was only 30 days. Bummer!"
1,Horrible Customer Service,I received the wrong AC adapter and i have tried several times to return this item to the supplier. I have filled out the return request form twice and still no answer. I will never do business with Amazon again.
1,Wrong Item,"Wrong, wrong, wrong!!!...When I typed in this adapter for my Toshiba computer to replace my broken one I was ecstatic to see it was the exact same one I currently have, at least according to the picture. Then I received an adapter that belongs to A computer, but not MY computer, and probably not even for Toshiba at all... and the product was completely different from the picture that is on amazon.com. It was HUGE compared to my original adapter. And looked nothing like the listed picture. I don't know if this product came from a person or from a company. But I was completely dissatisifed. The adapter doesn't even work with my computer. The one time it did work I still had to have my battery on my computer to use it (which is not the purpose of the adapter) and then the next time I went to use it, my computer lit up blue to say the pack was plugged in and then shut off. I will be sending the product back to the supplier."
1,Does not connect well with computer,"I bought this as a replacement for the Toshiba brand adapter, but it does not work most of the time. It fits into the opening, but something doesn't connect and it won't charge unless it is turned just the right way and pressed down. I will be returning it."
2,Toshiba Power Cord,I was a little dissapointed in this product. I wish it would have stated the length of the cord. The cord is very short. Also the connection port that plugs into the computer is loose and is easily knocked out.
4,"It worked, so ... OK.","Can't say much, except that it arrived very quickly (to San Diego, CA) and it worked for a Toshiba Satellite A60. Kinda bulky, but nothing out of the ordinary. For the moment, beats the +99 dlls option that I saw at Best Buy :)"
3,Toshiba adaptor,I got the product with in the specified time. The only issue i got with this buy is the product description says it is Toshiba adopter but it is not. It is only comaptible to Toshiba model which I buy.If I know this is some thing else then I would buy original Toshiba product it self by paying 15 to 20 dollors more
3,It's okay,"It's better than a lot of adapters out there however even with the thickened rubber mine has cracked, I did order another one and will use electrical tape to hopefully extend the life."
4,Perfect replacement,"I chose 4 stars because I think this is a great replacement adapter for my computer. This does not get hot like the last one I had, the only things I dislike is the size. It is pretty big and heavy."
3,My mistake,"I purchased this thinking it was an actual toshiba battery charger replacement. I guess I was too focused on the pricing of the product and over looked the actual product details. Oh well... I only rated it 3 stars since this is ok for my purpose of usage. In my personal opinion, I feel that this battery charger is way too bulky for travel purposes. I am a college student who already has too many books and school supplies that I need to carry around in my back pack. To me, this charger would be great as a stationary one for the house. It gets the job done."
4,Decent replacement adapter,Works fine as a replacement adapter for my Toshiba laptop. Slightly large in comparison to the original. Was in great condition on arrival and the transaction went very smoothly.
5,Buy for less,I have no doubt Mini Moos are delicious but Google Mini Moo...you will find it cheaper elsewhere.
1,killed my plants,"Terrible product. Valves began failing within 4 months of very moderate use - 15 mins daily.No visible problem or clogging in valve; they just refuse to work and emit a high pitched whine.This darn thing killed half my plants. After a month or two of reliable performance, I didn't check it daily - isn't that THE POINT?! That i don't have to go out 2 times a day and make sure things are being watered? By the time i traced the high pitched whine to the valves, the damage from weeks of watering-if-it-feels-like-it had been done.Unless you want to go out every day and watch the product to make sure it';s working, you'd do better off to buy a $5 watering can.Cannot overstate the horribleness of this product."
4,Its ok...,"well...I like the product and i cant say that the price isnt great but the earphone thing keeps breaking and although i fixed it, i dont think new things should break on the first day of using it. The car adapter and the cover are great!"
1,Avoid this kit at all costs!,I purchased this kit mainly for the hands-free part and was really disappointed in the sound quality. Everybody I call has complained about crackling and popping that quickly goes away after I unplug the hands free device. I am in the process of returning this equipment because it does not deliver as advertised.
3,case a disappointment,The inside plastic face insert pulled away from the leather outer cover in two months. It is no longer usable. It is still a good price for the charger and ear piece.
4,Great Price,I mainly bought this package because I needed the car charger and you definitely cant beat this price...for ten bucks I got not only a car charger but the hands free item and the case for the phone... The case is nice when I am traveling and dont want to worry if my phone is accidentally dropped or scratched... GREAT PURCHASE!!
3,Not one of her best 3 1/2 Stars,"I really thought this was a bland story, but I love this author and most of her other books are fabulous. I don't know, this one just didn't have any spark or spunk."
5,The seduction of his wife,"good reading , love reading Janet Chapman books, with good plot and enjoyable reading, five stars to her writing ability"
5,Works well but requires a good latch,"At first, my door's latch was too stiff to trust a key to.Installation instructions are sketchy, so I Googled it for some hints....After cleaning the latch up and adjusting it, I can now leave by the back door, locked, and go about my business."
5,"Lightweight, thoughtful design, excellent value","I have been using this tripod with a 484RC2 ball head. I find that to be an excellent combination. I have mounted a Canon EOS 30D with 70-200 f/4 L lens to it and it was stable. As others have noted the tripod can get a bit unstable at full extension but it still works fine. I am over 6' and I find it tall enough. When collapsed and with the 484RC2 ball head folded at 90 degrees, the tripod is a little over 26"" long which is a convenient travel size. Its light weight is a real joy - I keep it in a low cabinet in my study and when I need it, I just grab it with one hand and get to work. Using the center column sideways for low angle work is easy and a boon. Other thoughtful features abound - built in level, shoulder strap hook and easy to use leg clamps. The black finish has proved durable and I have experienced no performance problems or failures after three years of occasional use."
4,Really flexible and seems bullet proof,"Not the lightest, but light enough for the price.Very flexible for taking low angle shots due to removable center column that can be used horizontally and with legs angled very wide.Thumb detents for leg angle doesn't have as many preset settings as I would like, but that's a small issue (dropping it from 5* to 4*)."
2,Many caption mistakes,"I do not like to throw cold water on a history book project, but this book is riddled with misinformation and errors in captions and text related to railroad names, dates, state history, and locations - at least 27 upon my first viewing. I am really disappointed that I spend money on this."
1,Dont waste your money,"I hate it when ppl give positive reviews for crappy films, this is a waste of time and several bucks! I am not gonna waste anymore effort on this one. I do wish the reviews were more dependable. seems like ppl get a kick out of helping other to waste time nd fund on nothing."
5,inside reads,"Since recorded history began mankind has been suing herbs and growing them. Herbs have been used for medicinal purposes, to ward off insects, for their pleasant fragrance and improve flavor of food. This book was conceived to help you get the greatest measure of success in raising your own herbs and the greatest delight in using what you have grown. It shows in color more than 100 kinds, together with many of their variants, and tells how to grow them."
1,Avoid these sony camcorders like the plague,I bought mine last year and used it 3 times only until I recently got the dreaded C:32:11 error and now my camcorders is unusable. Sony asked $ 500 for repairs. Seriously? I bought this camcorders $250 and they are asking double the price for the repair??!!! Sony has the worse customer service I had experienced. I will never trust SONY ever again they lost me at every level!
5,Early Delivery!,"You All are the best sellers indeed! This product only took two days to reach me. That is the same amount of time for my other Items I ordered! I consider that Quick as Lightning! I appreciate it so very much too! Thank you For being so considerate to me! You are the ultimate people I like doing business with! Again Thank you very much, I especially love the Case!!!"
2,Same problem as many others C32:11 error,"I bought this camcorder a couple of years ago and it worked fine. Got it out of the box to use at my grandson's softball game this week, turned it on, pushed the button to open the door to insert a mini DV tape, inserted the tape but the door refused to close. I tried and tried to shut the door on the camcorder but it won't budge. Even though the battery I had indicated it was charged, and I do have an adapter, I went ahead and purchased a new battery thinking that might be the problem. Unfortunately I wasted the money I spent on the battery because the door is stuck open. The screen shows the 'C32:11' error saying to 'reattach the power source.' I've attached every power source possible and the tape door is stuck in the open position. Apparently the cost to repair is more than the cost of the camcorder so I guess I'll throw it in the trash. I'll be ordering another camcorder but not another Sony."
4,Definitely Good value for your money,"The machine works fine.If you buy the firewire cable (e.g., Sony VMC-IL4615 1.5 Meter i.LINK 4-Pin to 6-Pin Digital Video Transfer Cable) you can actually download the movies to a computer (as another reviewer pointed out). On the mac it works well easily and basically flawlessly (sometimes the rewind hangs on you, but it might be the OS X I have on that machine).Image quality is OK, I guess. You have to realize that I am an obsessed still photographer, so I will always complain for the image quality of a CAM recorder. It needs care when shooting at maximal focal lenght because it is so small that it is easy to make ""sea-sick"" productions.I previously ownen a JVC which I hated with all my heart. This one is great.I would definitely buy it again. If I had more money, I would buy the more expensive version of the same camera."
1,LCD Display broke within 6 months & labor costs $129.00,"I purchased this camcorder in July of 2006 because of all of the great reviews. The LCD display just stopped working (greyed-out, on-the-blink, the bottom of the picture/display is partially now on top, etc.) and I now need to send it back to the ""Sony Factory"" for repair. Even though the unit is under warranty for one year, it's only under warranty for parts -- not labor (which is the most expensive part of fixing something!!!). I'll now have to pay $129 just to have the display fixed.I liked the camcorder otherwise, IF you don't have problems. Not sure if an extended warranty would make a difference since you still have to pay labor -- that's ridiculous!"
2,Sorry I bought this item,"I am very disappointed with this camera. The image stabilizer does not work. I exchanged the first camera I bought for a second and was presented with the same problem. I tried the second camera for a while thinking I was at fault. Nope. The IS does not work. However, I am very pleased with the way I was treated by Amazon. I will now first look to them for any purchase."
4,sony DCR-HC26,"Great for the price, and I've had it for a couple of months, no problems so far. I would recommend this for a first camcorder or to those who don't want to spend so much. GREAT value."
2,widespread problems with cassette door not working,"Hi, I have had this for a couple of years but rarely use it. One day the door cassette door refused to shut. I googled this problem and LOTS of Sonys have this problem, and Sony does not even address this issue in the manual. I am afraid it is destined for the trash at this point, as it is not worth fixing. I really think Sony in general is not what it used to be. Stay away from this model."
2,Awful video quality,This video camera is so disappointing! Especially since Sony is usually pretty good. The quality of the video is awful and lots like crap when you watch it on a large screen tv. I am also having problems with the battery too. It doesn't seem to keep its charge more than 5mins!!! Stay away from this camera.
2,Lots of frustration,"This camcorder does not come with the cables necessary to transfer the image to your computer. And don't bother with buying a USB cable, since the images turn out awful. Get the Firewire cable. Oh, and you'll need to buy software to create DVDs, since Sony doesn't include that with the camera either. Overall, the deal you get on this isn't worth all the extras you have to buy to make it work."
2,Only good for TV viewing,"I purchased this for my husband and it was a huge hassle. The camera itself is fine, but if you want to upload any footage to a computer, good luck. I purchased the ilink cable just to make sure I could do it, but despite having a new, expensive computer and a new laptop, neither had the port necessary to accept the cable. So I had to go to three different stores to find the USB cable necessary. Finally I had video on my computer, but the cd-rom supplied with the camera didn't work. It insisted I couldn't open the main page without macromedia flash, which was already installed on my computer.So, essentially, if you're planning on not having your video on the computer, this camera is fine. Otherwise, it's way too expensive to waste your money on for a whole lot of hassle. I really wish I hadn't purchased it."
2,Camera,"For those that experience the 10 min problem - use another software - like Pinnacle or better ULead, then you will be able to download at one piece."
1,This is ONLY for a Lenovo monitor,"Nowhere in the description does this state it is made to attach to a Lenovo monitor. I did a search for 'laptop speakers' and this looked like it would be compact and functional. The sound is no better than the speakers in my laptop and because of its design I can't use it without it being in the way. If the cable was at the end or it opened a little wider it might be possible to lay across the top of the keyboard next to the hinges.IF this quality of speaker were for a laptop I would give it a 3. Since this is designed to be a DESKTOP speaker, I would only give it a 1 1/2 tops. I've had $5 speakers that sounded better."
1,DESKTOP,"I enter in the searching engine laptop speaker and this product came out, I have a Lenovo 3000 N100 and being this product from Lenovo I thought was a match made in heaven it wans't. The sound is not bad, I believe is good enough at least for me, but nowhere in the product description we are told this ""sound bar"" is made for a DESKTOP so I can't use it with my laptop without having it disturbing me in the middle of my desk. If you have a lenovo screen is a good product completely plug and play but if you want it for a laptop stay away..."
1,Awful Speakers,"After 3 warranty replacements from Lenovo the speakers still do not work. Worked for about 2 months initally then quit working all together out of the blue. As a pc technician, I highly RECOMMEND, you do not buy these speakers at all. Stick with desktop speakers."
4,medium dog,"my dogs love getting new collar, my dog is medium 44lbs pit mix lab. it had twp notches left so fits goos, but if there still may grow go to the 24inch."
1,Autobiographical vitriol,"Bitter, inarticulate rant seemingly meant to prove the author's ex wife should not have custody of their son. I regretted buying it. It seems self published for it is full of typos and at times does not make sense. The author wishes to blame Falun Gong for his divorce. I wish he had thought about his son's future feelings before he printed such hateful allegations about his marriage and his wife. Falun Gong is good and should create greater kindness between husband and wife. I am sorry he feels the way he does about it.Mary Hook"
5,Our favorite hot sauce,"We love this stuff and it's hard to find locally. Great on Mexican food, especially tacos. I find it to be very hot, so I just use a little at a time."
2,Typical Western,"To the Last Man"" is a fairly typical, straightforward Western. It's the old 'Hatfield/McCoy' family feud scenario, complete with gunfights, cowboys on horseback and young lovers that cross the enemy lines to stay together. There isn't anything particularly Earthshaking or memorable here.Perhaps the most interesting feature of ""To the Last Man"" is the presence of a five year old Shirley Temple in a small role as Randolph Scott's daughter. She did the film well before her child star days, while she was under contract at a Poverty Row studio and doing bit part and walk-on work around Hollywood. Her screen brother, Delmar Watson, appeared with her again 5 years later in ""Heidi"" at Fox.If you're a fan of early talkie Westerns you might like this movie, but if not, ""To the Last Man"" might not keep your attention for long."
3,Magic garden,"The concept is cool but the setup is not the easiest. The landscape items don't stand very well on their own -- we used toothpicks to stabilize the pieces of cardboard. Within a few hours, we had crystals forming. It only took one bump to dismantle the whole thing."
2,This could be so neat....,"My kids (4 and 6) were so looking forward to this. And yes it does ""grow"" but it is almost near impossible to make the trees and ""grass"" stand up in their designated grooves on the tray. The grooves don't hold this stuff in place, not even with tape.Now that said, if you can get over the look of disappointment on your children's faces everytime the tree falls over, this product really does work. The blossoms and the snow are pretty amazing to see transform."
3,not as pictured,This definitely did not turn out as pictured on the box. One of the liquid bags was broken so there was not enough to make crystals. This would have been very cool if it had worked properly. Too bad...
3,Campy Taiwanese fun!,"It works - in just one day! Though the yellow / green plants don't end up looking like the picture on the box, the mountain and the trees really do! We took a photo every hour for extra fun. My only complaint is that there's nothing in the directions which tells you what is actually going on - just an afterthought assurance that it's non-toxic."
2,More like powder garden,"Yes, it was cool to watch the ""crystals"" form. They were like powder puffs, and it was nearly impossible to make the different pieces of paper stand in the plastic container. When it was fully formed it was extremly fragile crumbling to the touch. Not appropriate for children who want to touch everything."
3,"Helpful, but not in script writing","Though it does give elaborate a bit on most ins-and-outs of Filemaker Pro 6, it doesn't go much into scrip wrtiting: a few lines, a few examples, not much 'general' syntax, and all its parameters. Anybody knows of a book that just teach you about (Filemaker Pro 6) scripts and scripwriting?"
1,a veteran prof. FileMaker Developer,"The Book of FileMaker 6: Your One-Stop Guide to FileMaker Pro, Pro Unlimited, Developer, Server, and Mobile by Chris Kubica does go beyond the user manual included with the FileMaker Pro application in many respects (the templates and files on the CD-ROM are OK) but it still spends a great deal of time talking about the basic capabilities and features of the FileMaker Pro application itself instead of what you can build with the FileMaker application in the real world. This type of basic instruction, while important to beginners, is a waste of paper for intermediate to advanced developers which is its target audience. ' Sorry, I *LOVE* FileMaker, but this is yet another example of a FileMaker book written by a developer with little experience outside of the FileMaker 'box.' This is *NOT* the complete reference you've been looking for."
1,"Same issue as other reviews, 5mo old","my twins love this toy so I am sad that it has this problem as it is now in the trash. My boy twin just had his hand stuck in between the ducks and was hitting himself in the face with the toy because it was stuck to his hand and he was freaking out. Not a safe toy and it is sad that with these reviews and it clearly being a problem, I have not found any recall alerts for the item from playskool."
1,Even as a gift its bad,"Even as a gift, this toy is a bad one, my son received it as a Christmas gift along with other rattling, colorful toys. So it was played with a few times. Once, my son did the same thing as mentioned in other reviews, he caught his hand in the middle of the ducks. It is now a paperweight on my desk."
2,Not for Dominique Swain Fans,"When i first bought this i was expecting so much from one of my favorite actresses, boy was i disapointed. To me this movie was so boring that i pretty much fast fowared through half of it. If you want to see something like ""Lolita"" or ""Girl"", then this movie isn't for you as is it wasn't for me."
4,Dominique Swain in a wonderful romantic comedy of the......,"Hell Iterns have to go thru...this is a very intertaining film about a iterns rise for respect, a career and for the love she wants to see the beauty in her.....love this movie...."
2,Not pleased,"This book I purchased, thankfully, was a hard cover book or it would have never made it thru the postal system.It arrived partially wrapped in a brown paper bag with 3 rubber bands to hold it on the book.Very shabby."
2,a+ guide to software,"Book was described as in good condition with some writing. The book is highlighted 3 quaters of the way through with writing on the pages as well, the actual books physical condition is in great shape, no issues with the binding or anything of that nature. Since I only paid [...] dollars for a [...]dollar book, I guess I'm getting what I paid for."
4,100 things guys need to know,"It can be tough being a guy--but this book will definitely help. It's fun and easy to read, and has lots of great tips and resources for guys. If every guy read this book, the world would be a better place, no question!"
3,Lyrical mosaic,"Islas's poetic story is about the Angel family, originally from Mexico, and now living in America near the border. Weaving back and forth across time and weaving the various threads of family members together, it gives a stunning portrait of its various individuals and the whole family stuck on the boundary of heritage, of class, of race, of religion. There's Miguel Chico who's avoiding his sexuality as he struggles to balance his Mexican identity with his American education. His father Miguel Grande loves his wife and his mistress equally, and when he's forced to choose, he finds he cannot. And Miguel Grande's brother Felix who is unable to escape his passions for young men, which brings his life to a violent end. And throughout it all, there's the women in the Angel family who are steady, patient, and at the heart of the family. It's a beautiful, poetic series of snapshots that flows with the reader like the water the desert lacks."
3,Average,"Leah is married to Dell Fletcher, a famous baseball player, who has recently suffered a bad injury that puts a halt to his career. The injury puts a strain on their relationship, with Dell not being able to handle not playing, and he is addicted to pain pills. When Dell disappears for awhile, Leah finds herself attracted to Angel the cop, who is in charge of Dell's case. I thought the book was ok, but kind of boring at times, I also thought the situation with Angel could have ended a little different."
2,Never Left The Starting Blocks,"I can't in good conscience say that I enjoyed this book. I didn't. It took me two weeks to read it and the only reason it didn't take me longer was because I refused to let the sluggishness and the cliche of the plot slow me down any further. The story never seemed to have any pace to it, and it just meandered around and around until it finally ended. The characters were shallow, the story, while a good idea, didn't have enough suspense or intrigue to really hold my attention for more than a few pages at a time. I hope better is on the way from Sister Thomas."
2,Too Slow,"The story just moved TOO SLOW( and boring) for me. I usually read books fast, but after 2 weeks of sruggling through this book I just went ahead and returned it to the library."
2,Did not run fast enough,"I cannot say that this book was good. The storyline or rather the intent of the storyline was good, but the writing of it wasn't good. It just simply moved along sooo slow, the narration at times was too long. I agree with the reader on 12.1.02. I also read Trisha Thomas previous book, Nappily Ever After and I do recall feeling fatigued trying to get through that book. I hope her writing and developement of the storyline improves with her 3rd book."
2,Way too Slow for My Taste,"I must admit that I love fun filled drama when it comes to book. It usually takes me no more than two days to finish a book but this one took me more than two weeks. This book failed to grab me from the start. I found myself skipping paragraphs just so I can finish the book. I must admit I cannot recomend this as a must read. If you come across it for very cheap then you can give it a whirl or if you don't, don't waste your time."
2,Paint Problems,"This is a great set at first and my kids loved playing with it. The only problem is that the paint is chipping all over the set...the wood is just not holding up on this set. In addition, you can't actually put water in the items to practice pouring etc. We had to replace this set after less than 6 months. I'd recommend going for a more durable plastic set."
2,So disappointed,I was so excited getting this doll for my daughter's 5th birthday. The doll itself is beautiful but the skirt only worked for about 5 minutes! I thought it might have been batteries so we tried replacing them again and again but nothing can get her to work again. So disappointing. My daughter still says she likes her...but hasn't picked her up since her birthday. Such a shame that it broke so easily...it should be better made considering it was meant to be played with.
1,Doesn't work at all!,"What a disappointment. I was hoping this Barbie would respond to my daughter's movements. Instead, any comments or movements of the doll seemed completely arbitrary. If you are buying this doll for its ability to interact with your child... DON'T! This toy is a rip off. BEWARE. At best, it is a delicate doll that will get easily broken. At worst, it is a misrepresented toy. It simply doesn't work."
4,beckysue,Bought this for my 4 year old niece. She absolutely loved it!! It was the big Christmas hit for her. It was a little difficult to get the batteries in her thighs but once we did it worked easily and my niece played with it over and over and over and over and over.
5,Princess Genevieve Doll - Barbie In The 12 Dancing Princesses,This was brand new as advertised and is now well loved. quick shipping good experience ty
2,"Cute, but not impressed.","My daughter loves to change her Barbie's clothes, but with this Barbie you can't really do that because of the dress that supposedly twirls. Apparently hers is broken because it has never worked. We didn't put battereies in right away, so I think since the kids were twirling the skirt for her, which let's face it kids are going to do that, it must have broken that way...or it never worked. I'm not sure which. It's a cute Barbie, but I sometimes wish they would keep it a little simpler, so it can be both a Barbie doll and Genevieve."
3,Okay for a Barbie,"I bought this at $9.99 on a recent Amazon special for my granddaughter's next birthday or Christmas. When I received it, I was surprised that the outfit and doll itself weren't of better quality. It's probably worth what I paid for it, but stacking it up to other Barbies, it seems pretty average. Given some of the other reviews, I'm concerned that it may not last long on the twirling skirt stuff."
2,weird,"This toy is strange because when you press a button on her leg, her skirt spins around and lights up. The skirt gets hung up easily. I think this is gimmicky. My daughter (6) loves the 12 Dancing Princesses movie but prefers to play with regular Barbie's and never chooses this one."
4,My daughter sure does like it.........,"She loves that it lights up and seems to really enjoy playing with it (she's 3). I think it is a nice looking doll though I do find it a bit strange that the skirt twirls around.........then again, it IS afterall a toy and need not be realistic to be fun. No the clothes are not removable....making her one of the only Barbies in my daughters collection that isn't naked. ;) As far as Twila goes I thought she looked like the one in the movie. My daughter would have rather it not have a string like an ornament though."
2,Not the real thing,"Well, I see someone else had the same comment. I was a little disappointed because I sent my 7-year-old granddaughter this for Christmas. When I talked to her later, I asked how she liked the doll and she said, ""It's fine, but it's not the real one."" I still have no idea what she means, but if a 7-year-old can tell it's not the real doll like the Princess Genevieve in the movie, then there's a real problem with it. How awful to have sent my granddaughter a second-rate gift for Christmas! That's not really something you can undo!"
4,Princess Doll,This was a christmas gift for my great-neice. Everyone liked the doll but we could not see the dress light up because the screw on the cover of one of the battery housings was stripped and we couldn't get it open. The doll was so cute though that the little girl took it home with her anyway. She didn't want to give it up for return.
4,nice doll,"My 4 year old granddaughter had to have this doll because one of her friends has it. She had a huge grin on her face on Christmas Eve. The only disappointment I have is that it has to have batteries. Of course, the fact that the skirt ""spins"" and lights up is the whole point for her. She loves it."
5,Basic Calculator,Very simple. Does all I want. Numbers on display are easy to read. Turns itself off. Very low price.
3,Average for DL DVD media,"These disks were hit and miss for me. I went through about 3 spindles of this brand of DL DVD, had about 5% of them end up as coasters (Had some layer break problems, and data problems. Firmware was up to date). I love Sony's 4.7 gb DVD's, but their DL's are manufactured by CMC and have a higher error rate than Verb. I would recommend paying a little bit extra for Verbatim."
4,Works for me,"Bottom line is they have a 5 percent fail rate. I keep buying them because every thing else I have tried has been a lot worse. I have a mid level burner made by Hitatchi- LG, I think it says HL. I have made about 40 backups and 2 failed."
1,Don't use it to record video,"I'm dubbing 8mm tapes from a sony GV-D200 video walkman to a sony DVDirect VRD-MC5 using this DVD+R DLs. From 12 DVDs recorded, 1 didn't finalized and 3 of them freez the picture near same time, in this case at 1 hour 55 min xx sec. This DVDs can record up to 215 min in SP mode. 25% of this DVDs, at the moment didn't work. Waste of time and more wear to the 8mm tapes for a new recording. Defective manufacture process."
5,AWESOME !!!,Can't beat the quality for the price. Going to need more soon so I can get all the movies off of my 10 external hard-drives.
5,Sony dual layer DVD's,Received them just as I expected and were delivered timely and in good condition. These disks work where others seem to fail. Good Job!
1,Failed on first burn,"I tried these, bought this exact pack from Bbuy and the very first disc failed on the burn. I previously used verbatim, guess I'm going back to them. I'm going to try 5 then hopefully BBuy will accept my returned product or credit for the stack of coasters.I also had previously used Memorex DL's, which have Horrible reviews but worked fine continuously for my laptop.-Vets 4 0Bama"
5,"great product, fast shipping",I recived my order within 3 days! In perfect condition and very fast shipping! I selected standard shipping and still recived my order in 2 or 3 days.
3,"ok, I guess","so, yes, the patches turned brown after wearing them overnight, however, I agree with the other reviewers that the composition of the product makes it prone to turn brown naturally and not necessarily because of it's absorbtion of toxins from the body. I didn't feel any different after using this product, so I guess no harm no foul, but I probably won't buy any more. and the gooieness left after removing the patches was highly unpleasant although it was not difficult to scrub off."
5,An excellent supplement,"Seller shipped fine. However, please note that this is an 8 oz. jar, as stated in the title. I didn't notice that, since I've never seen this size advertised before. Shipping weight is 1 lb, product is 1/2 lb. My oops..."
5,Great shears.,"These are heavy duty lefty scissors. They cut precisely, and can be sharpened professionally--they should last longer than I do. Bravo, Mundial."
1,Maybe I got a Faulty Pair,"After reading the other reviews I was very happy to pay the big bucks for these scissors. I was extremely disappointed.When I first opened the box I was concerned by the fact that there was a hole in the plastic packaging but I hoped that wouldn't matter. I don't know if that is to blame for the sorry state of these shears but it could have been a factor.The blades were sharp enough but they were coated in a thin layer of an oily substance. I wiped this off with a paper towel. From the very beginning they were very difficult to cut with - jerky and hard to open and close. It was misery trying to cut out a pattern and fabric (a thin, soft fabric).I am sending them back immediately. I thought about exchanging them for another pair in case I just got a dub but I didn't feel it was worth the risk. I hope this was just an anomaly and that no one else has this type of experience with this product."
5,Really f'n good metal,"This CD is the greatest thing to be released since the last Carcass album. These guys rule live, so give them all of your money and buy whatever they try to sell you. You must buy this and their next album. POOCH FOR PRESIDENT!!"
3,Mostly Exercises,"I purchased this book for ideas and games for a preschool level fitness class. Most of the book is one-on-one exercises for toddlers...very patient and ""easy"" toddlers. There are a few games in the back of the book. Not what I expected according to the description."
3,functional but not balanced very well,"Set this one aside after a few uses and went to Wildforthevine.com and bought a few from them (I highly recommend those). This one will work but it's not balanced right for your hand and winds up being a nuisance. I use my other sprayer daily with the horses and they last for years (the wildforthevine.com ones), the only reason I tried this one was my horse finally broke the nozzle off the other one and this was a little cheaper. After getting aggrivated for the last time I gave this one to my honeybunny for yard use. Not impressed."
4,fairly good,"I got it as a gift, i always wanted an Ankh cross. It looked better online, the real product is very shiny, not exactly what i opted for!I got it to a jewel shop and they processed it somehow. It's not shiny anymore and it has a kind of vintage look which works fine with me.But i had to pay to make it look that way."
2,A little disappointed,"I was a little disappointed because this pendant looks stunning. When I got it in between the wire wrapping there was all this crusty white looking stuff. Not actually sure what it was, but its still on the pendant now, because of its position it would be impossible to get out. Other than that I really liked it."
5,Artec Paste your Awesome!!!!,"Artec Textureline Paste is the Best for men's short hair. I makes it lay down but is not too hard like some that are on the market that is used to spike hair. It is very hard to find in salons or beauty supplie stores. I had one place in the Valley Plaza Mall in Bakersfield, Ca called Salon Secrets that carried it but they went out of bussiness and now I can't find it anywhare in Bakersfield now. Very frustrating when you can't find a certain hair product that is so good no where in town. Very glad I found it on Amazon.com. If anyone reads this post and has information whare I can buy this product in Bakersfield, Ca please e-mail me and let me know at ronwoolley@aol.com. Thanks."
2,A HUGE dissapointment,"I never write reviews but I always read them and I felt that if I can warn somebody before they made the mistake of buying this video, I'd have done a good thing. First of all, this Movie has the keyword ""Uncensored"" in the title. This is simply not true! In fact the few scenes that were worth watching the ""key"" areas below the waist were blurred out as if you were watching the 9 o'clock news. Second of all, they kept replaying the same clips of the best booty shakin' and most of the time they were doing cheesy interviews and skits. Also, this movie features about 40% women and 60% guys on camera."
1,Not worth the money,"Buy an adapter that allows you to plug in grounded appliances, such as your laptop and so many other electrical components these days. I am trying to use this one with a grounded U.S.A. adapter, and the link is a poor one, keeps breaking. The price for shipping (more than for the adapter itself) is a rip-off. Pay more for an honestly-priced adapter that allows you to plug in your grounded appliances."
3,Not really what I needed,"My memory of plug in India was somewhat off. This plug is found occasionally, usually with high current plugs for heating appliances, but not as commonly as I remembered. And when they appear they usually have a kind of double-plug arrangement for a more standard European plus as well (at least in India; I don't know about the other places)And finally, it is disappointing that the ground pin is plastic, and it does not accept a grounded US plug. So altogether, this was useless to me, although I guess it might fit the bill for some needs."
5,Another heavy metal gem from the past,"Ruler of the wasteland is perhaps better than Chastain's first album, more intense, more focused and with better production values. The title track, One Day to Live and Angel of Mercy are some of the album's and the band's best songs. This is classic hevay metal you should own."
3,From Victim to Victor,"Along with the book Safeguard Your Identity, this book helps to deal with the theft of one's Identity and the importance of knowledge in this field, even if it hasn't happen to you (yet)."
5,Handwriting Without Tears,"I love this book! I knew nothing of cursive before I started this book, and now I can write cursive and read it as well."
5,A Great Psychological Thriller!,Quiet Time will take you by surprise! Even frequent readers of murder mysteries and psychological thrillers will be mesmerized by this story! It's truly one you won't be able to put down.
4,"Good, but not for dilettantes","There are two chief sources for the Norse myths, the Elder (Poetic) Edda and the Younger (Prose) Edda. This is a translation of the Prose Edda and includes the creation of the earth from the remains of the giant Ymir, the death of Baldr, the twilight of the gods (Ragnarök), and certain stories of Sigurd and Brynhild (Siegfried and Brünnhilde in Wagner's operas). Most translations include only the parts that are ""of interest to the general reader"", but this one is complete, so you can make your own judgment about which parts to read and which to skip. The translation is solid, though perhaps a little flat at times, and the price is right. Definitely for those with more than a passing interest in Norse mythology, though; if you just want to read the stories without bothering about the literary sources, you might be better off with a retelling, e.g. Favorite Norse Myths by Mary Pope Osborne."
1,Horrible quality!,"The print was horrible, some words you can't even make out and sentences run off of the page. It's clear to me, today you can print any crap."
5,Awesome book!,"This book is as good, if not better than the ""making of"" book for the first Jurassic Park Movie. It's filled with great pictures, and stories of preproduction, and production. If you want a good look behind the scenes, this is what you'll want!"
5,Rancho RS5000 Excellent Replacement for 2002 and Up Dodge Ram 1500,Excellent product!!! What more is there to say. The factory installed shocks on my 2002 Dodge Ram 1500 have always been soft for a truck. I finally got tired of bouncing all over the place when going over bumps or just even pulling into my driveway. The Rancho shocks are built strong and now the ride is the best it has ever been.
2,Not very long lasting...,"I used them on my Toyota all around and they lasted all of 4 years.One of the front shocks, the cross pin on it sheared. That should never of happened. The cross-pin corroded through and sheared off. Instead of one solid machined piece of steel, it was folded sheet metal which corroded through and rusted out. Not even the tough Rancho white paint could stop that I guess. The other front shock was blown/jammed. You couldn't compress it at all! Talk about a stiff ride...One of the rear ones leaked a bit but I could have lived with that. The other rear was fine.All of that in only 4 years of wear and tear - on road only. I'm trying other brands because Rancho is not as good as I thought."
1,Way worse then OEM with 60K,"These shocks compressed without almost any pressure, I could pull them all the way out then push them down with my pinky finger. My old OEM shocks with 60K on the were way more stiff a million times over it actually took force to compress them. Not sure how these would hold up but I would assume they would be very soft. I have a 06 Dodge Ram and gonna keep the old ones on for a while till I find something better, maybe some Bilstein."
1,Worst DVD I ever bought!,Main feature + extra's are bad: scenes end abruptly; the story line is poor; background music is annoying; explanation to scenes insufficient ... DO NOT BUY!!
4,I like the ribbons,These ribbons are going to go perfect with my scrapbook ideas that I have going. I wish they were a little bigger.
1,Too Expensive,They probably don't want you to know this but if you go to grocery outlet this same package of smoked salmon is only 4.99. At least here in Oregon it is.
4,Another Solid Live Dio Album,"""Evil Or Divine"" is one of several live Dio albums to be released in the last decade or so. Personally, I preferred ""Holy Diver Live"", but ""Evil Or Divine"" stands on its own as a worthy document of Dio live on the ""Killing The Dragon"" tour. The performances are good by all concerned, with Doug Aldrich providing energetic guitar playing and the rhythm section of bassist Jimmy Bain and drummer Simon Wright holding down the bottom. The songs are solid, representing a cross-section of Ronnie James Dio's career. Highlights include ""Fever Dreams"" and Egypt/Children Of The Sea"". Worth getting, even for those who own other Dio live albums."
4,Same book?,I am 71 years old and I read this book in elementary school. I would recommend it for imaginative children.I don't recall the author but the plot was the same. This would have been in the early 50's.BillB
4,photos are great,"This book is a translation from the German. I assume the author was working from technical papers written for/by the Wehrmacht, as a couple of these pages are reproduced in the text. A good overview of Soviet field artillery. Photos of many of these guns are hard to come by. Readers looking for more comprehensive coverage of Soviet artillery should investigate the work of Ian V. Hogg. A good value for the money."
5,A FIRST read for every woman considering self-publishing.,You don't have to wait and hope to be published by a major publishing house. Start publishing your own book. Murphy takes you through each step of the process from start to finish in an easy to read well illustrated format. I wish it was available when I started self-publishing my first book. The guides I used to get started were meager at best in comparison. This book is a winner.
1,would not suggest unless you dont like to read,"Pretty much a clff notes version, except a more simple version. The pamphlet gives you key characters and a plot summary. Unfortunate purchase."
3,A Great Letdown!!!,"I waited a long time to receive this Literature Guide for my Middle School class. I have to say that it was not worth the wait....I chose this guide, in part, because it was put out by a reputable company....Unfortunately it is not up to par.....and contains very little that I would want to use...."
1,To Kill a Mockingbird (Literature Made Easy Series) should be clearly labeled Cliff Notes.,"I was misled into thinking I was getting a paperback version of the book - not cliff, study notes. It should be clearly pointed out that this is NOT the book. Since the postage cost more than the book, it is silly to return the book. So now, I guess I will have to go to the library to get it. Too late to re-order for my bookclub."
2,To Kill a Mockingbird,"I requested a paper back copy of To Kill a Mockingbird for $2.99 and thought I carefully selected the 'possibly used' paperback. Because delivery could be 2 or 3 weeks, and I wanted the book for a book club meeting in FL in early January, I opted for 10 day delivery for $9+.The item arrived about two weeks later and it was a study outline with exerpts from the book and study sheets...not at all what I wanted and of no use to me. I hope when I arrive in Fl this evening I will be able to get a copy somewhere as I know the book is out of print and difficult to find hence the order from Amazon, which I use principally for e books. Grace Kelly"
2,So NOT the novel.,"The fault could be mine. I didn't look for a product description. That would have cleared the whole mess up. This IS NOT the novel, but a Q&A study guide. Its not even a Cliff's notes version. So I thought I had the novel and have nothing I can use. I was not happy."
3,Not the full book,I bought this thinking it was the full length novel. It isn't. Not sure how it is as a cliff note.
3,"for the size ok, but in general too weak.","I hoped to get the perfect little sub for my amplifier, which is also a Pyle product with 400W.I hoped this is the perfect combination, but was disappointed by the bass. Its still loud, but I am getting close to the limits of the sub very fast. The real punch is missing. I probably should have bought a bigger one. Good thing, it is small and doesn't take much space. The LEDs on the front are not working, but this is also not important for me."
5,OUTSTANDING DOUBLE FEATURE !!!,"Dudley Moore is totally outrageous in this role. For me, it is his HALLMARK portrayal of a spoiled rich drunk, who has do deal with reality. The actors and actresses are perfectly cast for these roles, its a if you are on the outside looking in at someone's real life. HOW DARE HOLLYWOOD try to RE-MAKE a classic like this! When you have a 'brilliant cut diamond', why replace it with 'cheap glass' with no class. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AT THE MOVIES - THIS IS A CLASSIC TO OWN & KEEP !!!!!!!!"
5,Very satisfied,Bought as a gift and it came very fast and in wonderful condition...couldn't beat the price.
3,Arthur,There was a delay in the shipping and when I received it about a 1 inch slice in the back of the movie case. No damage to the actual disk itself. This is a fabulous movie one that I have remembered for years and much better than the new release of Arthur.
4,Second movies usually fail - this one too.,"Arthur is a classic movie and most people will thoroughly enjoy it. Dudley Moore is superb - but John Gielgud is better! 'Arthur' is a first rate movie and, by itself, Arthur fully deserves 5 stars.Sadly, the same can't be said of 'Arthur 2'. In spite of this being almost a rehash of 'Arthur' - which, as I said, was an excellent movie - I give it 4 stars because it is still very funny...........in places. However, the script is too predictable and the acting undistinguished - with the notable exception of John Gielgud who excels naturally. (John Gielgud could gain a deserved Oscar, for reading his breakfast Corn Flakes packet!)Those who thoroughly enjoyed Arthur, will enjoy the sequel movie - but don't expect any real 'class' to emerge - other than from Gielgud!"
3,Mobetta,"The disk worked fine, but my only complaint was that both movies are on one disk. I was a little confused at first. I guess it is fine, just a little strange."
5,Arthur Movies,Found this movie online. Had been looking for it for my husband.Great comedies. Enjoyed watching this with my family. A
3,Good thing they sell this in a pack....,"Arthur was a pretty funny movie. I've never seen it before & i enjoyed it. However Arthur 2 was very, very, VERY boring and we fell asleep during the first 20mins of it. So I am glad they came together in one pack because i would have wanted my money back for the 2nd one."
2,"""Sound enhanced""","The eight sitcom episodes on this GENIUS ENTERTAINMENT product are certainly tempting. Be advised however that the description ""sound enhanced"" means cheesy modern music that's used in place of theme songs or during breaks in action where background score is all you hear.Programs thus tampered with are very annoying, especially to those who remember how they originally sounded. I made the mistake of buying one of GENIUS's TV Guide ""sound enhanced"" box sets, but won't be purchasing others.Change the channel."
5,Worth watching !!! Heads up history buffs !,"I believe this DVD of Joseph Stalin, as told by one of his bodyguards, Alexis, is worth watching despite the above low star ratings above. His memories are well implemented and you can see the recorded historical moments in his eyes, emotions. True Stalin was a murderous tyrant which is forever recorded in history. At the end the former bodyguard (in his 80s at time of recording) teaches little Russian children (pioneers) how top play the accordian ... - etc. You really can sense history thru-out the video. I give it a very good rating. If you are a history buff - then this is a must!!!!!! A++++++++"
2,"Promises much, delivers little.","We might imagine that Stalin is still alive with this unfocused poorly produced documentary. It is in Russian but that's not the worst of it. An old man apparently one of the last cronies of Stalin peppers us with stories of the old paranoid. But they could be entirely fabricated, Who'd know? He cries over his long dead master. Much is unfocused. He was a security agent for the ballet which apparently Stalin enjoyed. He is also paranoid as if Stalin could suddenly appear. Fooled you. I'm not really dead. Stalin was in fact dead for a long time just laying there in bed. Everybody was afraid he was just sleeping. You could be shot for waking him up. Or not waking him up. In the end this old gentlman (I've forgotten his name) shows footage of his music classes. Pass on this one."
4,How to be a punk rock star.,"I particularly, enjoyed this ""How to be a punk rock star"" Manual. It shows that being a punk rock star is relatively easy. Just take a normal young boy( being you) set him up in a dysfunctional life style, like a divorced family. Then That boy, must become disattacted from the rest of the world. Get that boy a guitar. Let the dysfunctionality of his life ensue as he grows up. Then hes got to meet some other underpriviledged musicians. Give them a place to play everynight. Add some drugs,of course. Then you will have a bunch of druged up punk rockers. You need one more thing. You need a major music corporation to sign them up and expliot them. Thats all it takes. oh, and make sure the little boy(you) kills himself before people stop buying the albums. This book seems to have alot of honesty, and really thats what you want in a Biography. It has the good and the bad."
2,don't bother,"This book is very difficult to get into. Poorly written and in poor taste. As a big Kurt Cobain fan, I was disappointed."
4,Wow!,"Nirvana is one my favorite bands, reading such important facts about this band openly reintroduced me to various points of the rock band lifestyle.The book is in splendid condition with all everything needed to understand basic information of the band and especially Kurt Cobain."
3,Good if researching Kurt's life,The author depended way too much on Courtney's version of her husband's life.
4,one of the only books on nirvana,"a great read for fans, yes, but you do come across Azzerad's small errors here and there. there are only about ten books exclusively on nirvana or kurt cobain, so being the best book out of nine or so other second-rate ones isn't a crowning achievement. it WAS extremely interesting though."
5,This book is the best!!!,"""Come as you are"" By Michael Azerad is a must have for any true Nirvana fans. It tells you the pain that Cobain had to grow up with, and how Vanity Fair and other magazines targeted him and his wife. This book shows you the true Nirvana and it's the best rock bio I've ever read."
5,Great read!!!,"First off, I'm not very much into reading books, never really have been. I found this book for sell at a local flea market. Seeing that I am a huge fan of Kurt Cobain and Nirvana I decided to buy it. Since then I've not been able to put it down."
5,Come As You Are,"Of all the Nirvana books I have read, (and there have been many) this is by far the best. I would definetly recomend it to any Nirvana fan, you must own it. There are good photos and I thought it was written very well."
1,No Good For Tannin,"Bought this product to remove tannin stains from my hands after turning wood on my lathe. This product, although it says will remove stains, paint and dyes etc didn't even put a dent in it. After some research I found a magical method of removing these stains. This is simply using natural Lemon juice which removes the tannin stains instantly. If you are a wood turner then try lemon juice from your local supermarket before buying this product.It may work for the rest of the items stated on the tub so this review is solely for those of us that end up with tannin stains on our hands on a daily basis."
5,Works well,"I love this stuff for removing grease from my hands. Works well. I keep a container under the sink. Smiles nice and leaves a clean, non-greasy feel. Washes off easily with water."
4,"Great product, not such a great price ...","I love Fast Orange for cleaning grease and oil off my hands. It is as good, or better, than anything I have ever used. I just purchased a 14 oz tub along with an air filter and headlight off of Amazon using my Amazon Prime account. Everything showed up at my door in two days as expected. The only bummer was that I saw the same 14 oz tub in my local AutoZone the next day for about a buck cheaper. Oh while, at least I saved a little money on my air filter and headlight."
4,I GET RELAXED JUST LISTENING !!,"I GET KOOL, CALM & COLLECTED WITH THIS ! WALTERS GIVES A DOWN HOME FEELING AND A SENCE OF LONGING . HE'S NOT BAD LOOKING EITHER. I WANT ALL HIS DSVD'S !"
4,Good first pop debut,"This is still one of my favorite albums of the mid-'90s. I didn't really like his song with the Heights from a few years back, but he stands out more on his own with this album. Hold On was the major hit on this album, but the rest of the album is solid with it being more rockier on a number of songs. His second effort didn't attract as much noise as the first, but it showed his talents a lot more. This album may have been the lead in to why artists like Ryan Cabrera, John Mayer, Gavin DeGraw and Howie Day are popular today. An emphasis on strong song structure, songwriting and more toward the song itself than image. So we have to credit Jamie for this current music trend now."
5,A OLD FASHIONED TALE FOR OUR TIMES,HER WORDS COME TO LIFE. THIS IS A BOOK WE NEED FOR OUR TROUBLED TIMES. IT JUST WISHED ME AWAY TO ANOTHER WORD. I LOVES THE ILLUSTRATION AS. MY FAMILY AND I ARE WAITING FOR YOUR NEXT BOOK. PLEASE HURRY !!BANNY IN FLORIDA
5,Unforgettable Hannah,"This new work by the well-known North Georgia folk artist Marie Elem is a must for folk art collectors. However, it will be enjoyed by young children and their parents as well. This excellent story is based on an old family tale concerning the author's great-grandmother, a strong, independent woman. Marie Elem is a natural story teller. Hannah and the children she helped are quite unforgettable. This book's large format (8 1/2 x 11 inches) with a separate page for each of the ten color illustrations by the author, is just what was needed for the correct presentation of this work. I have enjoyed this charming book immensely, and I look forward to more works by this artist-author in the near future."
5,BEST POSTER EVER!!,Blow is my favorite movie ever! This poster is amazing! Perfectly describes the movie and what George and Diego were all about
5,Blow poster,This is awesome. If ur a fan of blow or the movie this is a great poster for you. Money money everywhere.
4,No problem.,"This showed up fast, was the right thing and went right in with no problems. It's been over a month now and it still works just fine."
5,Worked great,I now have a working humidifier again. Took me about on hour to get installed. Hope this one lasts another 5 years.
2,Also failed in 2 years,"like another reviewer, my valved failed in almost exactly two years. time to make another purchase I guess. Not sure how long these things should last, will have to do more research. Might have to just keep replacing every two years. definitely need it working in the winter!"
2,Failed in two years,Mine failed in two years. I expected it to last at least 5 years. I would not recommend others to consider this product.
4,Works great but expensive,Part worked perfect. Took a minute to install & is running great. The only problem is that it is a little expensive. It should only be a $5 - $10 part.
2,Had trouble with this Product,I have skin cancer so complete coverage is important to me. I really like Neutrogena's other suncreen lotions (especially the oil free 45) but this product has shortcomings. It does not go on evenly and is clumpy. One time when I thought I had put it on evenly I was burned in stripes! I don't reccomend this product for those that need complete sunblock.
2,Damaged,"We just opened this box of envelopes for office use only to find that they have obviously gotten wet at some time. All of the flaps are glued shut to the body of the envelope, which renders them unusable. Disappointed in this shipment.Edit: Amazon allowed me a RMA and is exchanging the damaged enveloped for a new box. When they arrive intact, all will be well."
1,Transformations Bologna?,"There have been several websites that have questioned the facts in this video. If you buy or view this video I recommend you do the same. About a year ago I personally e-mailed Mareth Warren at the Sentinal Group who forwarded it to another (can't remember his name)requesting a refutation. The staff member responded that they were planning to post a refutation to their critics claims on the Sentinal web site; I'm still waiting.Additionally George Otis has never personally disavowed his unbiblical Moral Government Theology as outlined in his book ""The God They Never Knew"""
5,Self-esteem self improvement,"We all need a little bit of help and this book does that and more. I use it with my children and we are improving our self-esteem and our outlook on life. As we all know, the body works with the mind. This book goes straight to the point, no time wasting, and has wonderful exercises to work on. Good price and delivery. Thank you always Amazon. We are devout customers."
5,Best Book Ever!!!,"This book has helped me so much! It's very inspiring and I feel like it has made me a new person! It brought up a lot of things I never knew were related to what I was feeling, and has given me a whole new prospective on life and myself. I love it and would recommend it to anyone, even if you're just feeling down. It really helps you find your self worth!! :)"
4,The Self-Esteem Workbook,"As of yet, all I have done is the first two chapters of the book and already I feel better about myself. It feels as if the book seeks to combine common sense with explaining what could be causing your self-esteem issues, and together, that helps you get a little more control over your issue."
5,A great book for those suffering from self esteem,"This is a hands on workbook for those struggling with self esteem and all the ways that plays out in one's life. It requires ""doing"" so for those really committed to doing the work, it's a great workbook and much cheaper than professional help, but also a great tool if you are a therapist and want to support your client through the each challenge."
5,Very good material,The information in this book is excellent practical processes to understand and develop self esteem. I highly recommend it.
4,"Yes, I bought this book",It is a great workbook. I really haven't finished it. Its not a work book where bam your self-esteem increases in the first chapter but the work book is a read over and over and works with you in completing one chapter experiences before beginning the next.
4,GREAT tool for learning about yourself,This has been a great tool for learning about myself and helping me to understand the things about myself that I need and want to work on.
3,Average,This book is nothing special. I am not impressed. It seems the author had some other agenda besides having the reader explore self esteem.
5,ACoA can benefit from this book,"I have dealt with anxiety from time to time in my life. Lately, I decided to go to a therapist who recommended this book. This book has helped me understand that some beliefs from my childhood are distorted such as ""boys don't cry,""and it is wrong to get angry, so I am learning how to use techniques in order to replace negative thoughts into more positive ones. I am learning a lot about myself because of this book. More importantly, I am learning to deal with my anxiety effectively. I wished I had applied these techniques in my childhood, but you know the saying, ""it is never too late."""
4,THOROUGH,"The Maya Kings & Queens is a great reference book on the succession of Royal leaders during the Mayan Classic period (AD. 250-900). It breaks down the areas,such as Palenque, Calakmul, Yaxchilan, Capan, and Caracol, and there respective leaders. The sculptures and other images contained in this book are clear and distinct. This book is on par with anything written on ancient Egypt. However with all the different variations in the names of the Kings and Queens, I just wish the author would have broadened the index and made it more concise."
2,Too academic for a generalist audience,"The authors may be stars in the Maya world, but I didn't like this book much - especially after paying almost US$50 for the hardback version. It may have great illustrations and very informed analysis of certain city lineages, but it doesn't give you a good flavour of the history of Mayan civilisation. It's very academic in its approach and covers less than a dozen cities in the region. Its conclusions on the rise and fall of one of Mesoamoerica's foremost civilisations were a bit perfunctory for my liking. Stylish but dry. Two stars."
1,"Great book, bad movie","I was excited about seeing this movie because I am a huge Jim Thompson fan. Unfortunately, the people involved in producing this movie were unable to replicate the feel of the novel."
1,not good,i bought this dvd and i regret it completely... it sounds really bad for what i had expected
4,Claudia in Republic of Trinidad & Tobago,"I am about to pursue a degree program and human-computer interaction is one of the areas of study.This book has given me an excellent introduction to the subject area. It was very easy and simple reading which gave me the ""ESSENCE"" of the subject area. Its layout and style would also prove useful for revision just before examinations. All that would be required of me now is to acquire a book that has case studies to build upon this foundation.I was never aware that there was such an area of study called Human-Computer Interaction. This book has really highlighted the fact that while we may know about system analysis and design we tend to forget some of the ""HUMAN"" aspects of the user. We design things with the attitude that ""the user has to get with the times"".I would recommend this book for reading even by novices."
3,To CUTE,"Yea, this brush is sooo adorable. Problem is, the shipping and handling are WAY to EXPENSIVE. I regret for buying it when I could have a bought a green brush for $4 at Target. (I LOVE green!!) Anyway, my cat seems to purr when I use it and his fur is SOOOO soft now. Let's hope I use this brush for at least 1 year and everyday to make up what I had paid this brush for. I need to make it worth it. Next time, I'll just go to the store."
4,Nice Item,"Seems to be well made for a Chinese crate pad. I hope it doesnt ""pill""like the 2 fleece ones I've gone thru already. I trust the price reflectsthe quality.At least I hope so. So far, everything is okay."
3,Pawprint Dog Bed 25x20,Average dog bed. Not as plump as I had expected. Though my pug seems to like it!
5,Funky Eclectic Sound,"This extremely talented band puts all of their musical abilities to work, melding banjo, excellent guitar work(solo and rythm), saxaphone, and complex basslines to fuse a masterpiece of up-beat, funky, yet rock influenced sound that is sure to please the ears of anyone looking for an original, refreshing sound in a world of cookie-cutter bands that all sound the same. From rock riffs to funk-influenced basslines and the occasional acoustic reprieve, all the various sounds come together nicely to form a well balanced sound that encourages endless jamming."
2,African Sculpture,"I believe this to be an early-and mediocre- attempt by Warren Robbins to catalog African Art. Photos are all B&W; and questionable quality.This probably led to his and Nancy Nooter's book ""African Art in American Collections"", an excellent book covering many tribes/areas of Tribal Art.I would recommend buying the second book as a sound basis and investment in identifying African Tribal Art."
2,Interesting story spoiled by bad typesetting,"I downloaded a sample to try and the story seems good and well-written. I couldn't bring myself to buy the Kindle version of the book though because it's so badly typeset. It seems to have been scanned in from a previously printed copy as it has line breaks in the middle of paragraphs and mistakes like ""comer"" instead of ""corner"". It has also not been divided into appropriate sections. It's a shame to treat this writer's works (and her audience) so cavalierly."
5,Franco Scores Again!,"Paul Franco once again demonstrates that he is the master of social and political philosophy. Prof. Franco delves into every corner of Hegel's profundity to offer up a stunning cautionary tale; beware! Hegel, largely neglected and even more misunderstood, steers a course independent of the paralysing conformity of western ""liberal"" thinking and the totalitarian mysteries of the east; he was the last great third way. Franco shines a light on this and with bubbling clarity and freshness of prose let's even the beginning reader in on the secret we've all been missing."
4,The Original,"This is a marvelous work. You must teach yourself to read the 15th-century English, but once you have gotten the knack, it's not hard at all. Malory lived in a simpler time, and spoke a simpler language, than we do today. There is a vigor and energy to the prose that leaps off the page - I remember one knight threatening that he would ""fetch [his enemy] out of the biggest castle that he had."" This volume, which gathers Malory's work over many many years, also tells the story of a man learning how to be a writer, and also, I think, growing in his emotional understanding and inteterest in his own characters. The characters are so much more real and interesting at the end than at the beginning!"
5,Works of Malory by Eugene Vinaver,"I am undertaking a course in the Arthurian Legend and one of the course books we are studying is Malory's Morte D'Arthur. It is a complex series of short stories translated from Medieval French. Eugene Vinaver's Book, Works of Malory, throws a lot more light on a difficult subject in his parallel commentary.Especially, it was exciting and motivating to be able to locate a good copy of this valuable out of print book at an affordable price. Thank you AmazonMike HodgettsSYDNEY AUSTRALIA"
4,world trip,"Actually, the lead singer's voice is closer to Souxsie of Souxsie and the Banshees than Portishead. The first track sucks you in!!! This CD is close to the trip-hop production of Bowery Electric's ""Lush Life"" in crackling vinyl sounds cradling electronic beats and bleeps.This is an excellent debut, but they have room to grow. And I look forward to it."
3,Straight ahead trip hop,Not much variability to the sound and flow of the album. Don't think this CD could convert people to listen to trip hop but I consider it worth the money. ten times better than Paul Robb's Think Tank project.
3,More of a crime caper,"I am a fan of 50's sci-fi movies. If it is on DVD or VHS tape, I own it. Some are so bad as to be unwatchable. Some movies are outstanding. Some movies are so bad that they are good. I am glad I saw this movie and will add it to my collection but I thought it was only so-so. As I said in my review title, it is really a crime caper, a British one at that. The film quality is a bit scratchy but clears up as the film progresses. The audio is fine. The Brits can be a bit hard to understand but it gets easier as the film progresses. Definitely worth the $1.99 to rent. To own it is questionable."
2,Jumpsteady really should stay behind the scenes.,"Jumpsteady obviously is good at helping run a record company, because Psychopathic has been operating independently now since 1992 and has become one of the most successful underground labels in the music business history, but he really should stay off the mic. He doesn't write his own rhymes and his flow is incredibly slow and clumsy, and it's obvious he wouldn't even be recording an album if Violent J were not his brother. Outside of the guest appearances by Violent J and Myzery (who I loved while he was on Psychopathic) there is nothing stand out about this album. Sorry Jumpsteady, but don't quit your day job bro."
4,Almost as good as the 1st part,"Very good story, fun to see how the 2nd half ends but had one or 2 spots of what is going on?!?!? Some of the enemy's history and abilities would have been nice to know before the story is too far along. The Gorgon is a bit over the top with his abilities but excellent read none-the-less.New & Old School Wolverine fans alike will love this storyline."
3,Who drew the Cover,I like the look of this book - who drew the cover? The Steranko homage is hard to miss.
5,Nice material,Although they are a bit small for guitar they are working nicely on my mandolin. I like the texture of them and the material they are from very much.
3,The hands free is worthless - other 2 are fine,"This kit is way to good to be true. The charger works fine. As far as you can see, it charges the phone quickly. The case is fine too, not to fancy. BUT the handsfree is a joke. You cant hear well at all! Also, people on the other end dont hear you well either. Also, the button it has to answer/hang up does not work for the phone!"
1,Piece of Crap,This stuff isn't even worth $14.99. My husband and my aunt couldn't even hear me. It's a piece of crap. I sent it back the same day. DON'T BUY IT!!!
3,Incomplete Greatest Hits,"A great collection, but where are two of their big hits ""Don't Change"" and ""I Send a Message""? I know you can never appease all the fans, but, as a DJ in the 80's, those were tracks that are too big to leave off what is supposed to be a greatest hits collection."
2,I agree with the last reviewer.,"No ""Don't Change"" or ""Not Enough Time""? This is the sort of thing that makes me want to pound and pound some record company executive with a shovel."
5,complete,"If you are interested in INXS, this album will prove satisfying. It has all their hits and a few more treats."
3,catchy group,this group had catchy songs and a lead singer with personna.but after that they were pretty forgettable.need you tonight and a few other songs were good at the time and hold up alright even now but this group was way overrated.they were the australian bon jovi.
4,Their third best collection.,"First of all, everybody needs some INXS in their collection, and unless your a fanatic, a ""Hits"" album will probably due. However, the newer ""Best of INXS"" is far superior to this one. It has 21 tracks remastered, still on one disc, and includes ""This Time"", ""Bitter Tears"", ""The Gift"", ""Not Enough Time"", and ""Dont Change"", all of which are missing from this U.S. greatest hits. Plus others. It also drops the few tracks that didn't need to be on this one. Of course, what IS on the ""Greatest Hits"" cd is all good stuff. If you really need an INXS fix, look at the 2-cd ""Anthology"". That has everything on it. More money though. Whichever set you chose, you need something to stick between your ""U2"" and ""Cure"" cd's."
2,Not a fitting greatest hits,"Anyone who's followed INXS through the years should see right away that there are some huge holes in the song selection here. From the woefully represented ""Welcome to Wherever You Are"" album, the tracks Not Enough Time and Taste It are missing. And from the old days, the retro classic Don't Change isn't here either ! Is this a joke ? There are way too many easily forgettable tracks here in their place. Songs like Heaven Sent and The Stairs are hardly greatest hits worthy.Also the two ""extra"" songs on here are horrible and were probably collecting dust in someone's closet before being pulled out to fill up some cd space. This subpar collection was either put together with a blindfold, darts and a list of past songs, or the Atlantic records intern who got the job suffered a head injury shortly before."
1,Never trust a record label!,"No ""Don't Change""/""This Time""/""I Send a Message""/""Burn For You""/""Mediate""- no good review! Greatest Hits has got to be one of the all-time biggest music industry lies. Here's the strategy: 1) Get most of the hits of the biggest selling albums but leave off a crucial track or two (see the above list) so the back catalog continues to sell. 2) Throw in the hits of the later less-successful albums which is what these packages are really made for (Sure, I want ""Suicide Blonde"" but not at the expense of buying ""X"") and 3) add two unreleased ""hits"" aka ""filler"" and sell to unsuspecting longtime fans who have long worn out their cassettes. I hate it when a label exploits a musician's death but this time I was actually hoping they would and release a true ""greatest hits"". Of course, the industry let me down again!!"
4,Old songs - Great sound still resonates,"Nostalgia filled me as I listened to some of the most eloquent and poignant songs ever written and sung by the infamous Michael Hutchence, taking me back to the age of sixteen and absolutely loving the passion that surrounded this band. It was great to be re-aquinted with songs that opened up wonderful memories and experiences. Definitely a must have for any CD collection."
5,Fish Tape,As always - most anything you buy through Amazon is a good value. I am happy with the purchase. I really appreciate free shipping to Alaska.
3,"Great song, but buy the other single","I definitely recommend the other version with the mixes. This one is not Lady Marmalade only, but a compilation of other trashy songs from Moulin Rouge."
1,Horrible but Nice Looking Babes!,"I like the Video to the Song.the Girls Look Good.but as far as them as Singers&whatnot? they can't hold Patti Labelle's Left Lung.a Dinky Re-Make that Sounds more closer to En Vouge's ""Free Your Mind"" than the Original Labelle Jam.find the Original Jam leave this alone."
1,don't bother,"If you are only buying this cd for lady marmalade, don't bother. You should buy the sound track to ""Moulin Rouge"", it has lady marmalade plus the other two on the single and 10 other songs from the movie. this single is $..., the sound track only costs $..."
5,FISHY,"Since the local pet stores no longer carry this product, I order it and it comes in a very timely manner and the price is good. We have goldfish in our pond and they seem to like this brand the best. Have tried other brands and they don't eat it as fast as they do this. Who says that fish can't tell the difference. Ours do."
3,mug,"the mug is good but the original box was lightly damaged, I was a bit disapointed because is was meant to be a gift and I had to fix it."
4,Useful source,"This book explains finance basics with realistic problems instead of giving simple examples which dont make sense in learning the concept. A useful source for students, includes excel and calculator (HP19B)shortcuts for problems."
2,Missing Parts,"The book was missing the ""student CD-ROM and the Standards & Poor's card .The actual book was in good condition."
1,Movie score from... eh...,"The last 100 years must have passed Lauridsen untouched. This could have been written a century ago and wouldn't have been a scandal. Today, it sounds like the movie score from... eh... whaddayacallit...?"
5,"""I really like to spoon with this CD on!,"" Rod L.","This CD is one of my favorites. When my midnight mistress comes over, we like to ""jam"" and ""slam"" to this CD. Excuse me for not metioning my last name cause I am in the closet right now. This CD just rocks, so buy it now."
1,...?,"Are you serious? This CD exists? I gotta get this and give it to my friend as a joke Birthday Present... omg... I'm buying it right now!I gave it 1 star simply cuz I don't believe it exists... This IS a joke, right?"
4,Good Enough,"First off - it's a recording of live songs (I don't know if it comes from one or more concerts). Second - Tomhas an older voice. The CD is from 1999 and maybe it was recorded about that time frame.But, he still has the pipes."
1,disappointed,"I enjoy most of these books in the series, BUT... instead of being sexy this book felt more yucky than sexy. Every chapter referred to his constant Hard On. Ew! In chapter after chapter of this book was the same scene played over & over, just phrased a little differently. I had to skim alot....... I felt more repulsed than drawn into the story. Sorry the book just wasn't that good."
5,Outstanding!!!!,I loved the final book in the highlander series. My only regret is that I finished the book so fast. Adam was incredible and the story was awesome! I can't wait to see what KMM has in store for us next. Absolutely outstanding!
4,Turned out pretty Good...,"Okay, this one had a strong beginning. You quickly come to care for adam black and his outcome. But then the story started to wane a bit once I got in the middle. So I lost interest. But the last few chapters quickly made up for it. Which is why it gets 4****! I don't want to give anything away. You just have to read it. It's a good, entertaining, and heartfelt story with a GREAT HEA!"
2,Not good!,"As a fan of Ms. Moning I was very dissapointed in this novel. I almost never speed read through her stuff, but this book I literally scanned the entire thing! If I read one more time about his ""golden fae skin"" or how sexy he was, etc. I was going to scream! OK , I get it! He's hot, she's hot - let's move on into a real story about Adam! I bought the paperback- Thank God! But it is not a book I will be re-reading in the near future!"
4,The Immortal HIghlander 6,"Great book. There seems to be a lot of the same ""talk"" through out the book but it is easilly skimmed over for me. I still recommend it"
1,I really didn't like this book,"Adam Black a mortal? I didn't buy it-period. As much as Adam Black loved being a ""bad boy"" fairy, their is no way I could believe he would become mortal by choice. Not for any reason. As much as Adam Black was interpersed throughout Moning's previous novels, I expected more of a story. This book was a disappointment. I actually returned it and got my money back."
3,Very anti-climatic but necessary reading for the series!,"After much anticipation, I received the book and much to my surprise, Ms. Moning seemed to be in a hurry to close the the loose ends of the Highlanders. I am not a writer but an avid reader and was hoping that Adam and the Faeries would have been written with more in-depth characters. The ending was fast and furious and too short and sweet - way too happily ever after. I see some areas where Ms. Moning could pick up on the subject matter in other future books. Of course the men she writes about are positively yummy. I do look forward to reading more of her books if she chooses to write more."
3,Better than 'The Highland Myst',"I bought this book of this author and afterwards, before even reading it, I bought 'Beyond the Highlands myst' as it was at such a low price. But the truth is, that book was a fiasco for me, but anyway I wanted to read that one because the character of Adam Black sounded appealing. All in all, with no prejudices about the fiasco of the other one, I found this book to be interesting, specially in the beginning and in the end. I got a little bored in between, but hey, at the end it was an entertaining book."
4,Great book,I really enjoyed this book. It is the only one of the Highlander series I have read and I couldnt put it down. It was fast paced and sexy. I cant wait to read more of this series.
5,The best one yet!!,I love the highlander series!!! But The Immortal Highlander was the best one EVER!!!! I actually cried!!! I dont cry!!! It was funny!!! It was fabulous!! I love love love this series!!
3,Not good enough for a Hardcover,I wanted to like these books. I liked the main characters. I liked the story. I had hoped for more though and don't like the ending of this book. It's sad to say but I think this book should have been released as a paperback. It's not a book that I will go back and re-read nor will I re-read the series because of the ending.I don't like how they depicted the Fay and I don't like how the author has changed Adam Black to give a Happy Human ever after.If you like straight up Romance Novels were the woman changes the man and they ride off to the sunset then you might like this book.
2,Adam was boring and Gabby annoyed me.,"I usually love the Highlander series and was excited to finally read about the infamous Adam Black. Boy was I sorely disappointed. I tried my best to delve into the story but found Gabby, her abilities and Adam to be quite boring. I found myself skimming past descriptions of his pants, his life with Fae and Gabby's life as a lawyer. I couldn't make it through the end so I can't say if it got better or not. Adam's story line was so unique, I was sure that his book would have been done more justice than this. Perhaps it's time for me to move on to a different series."
4,Seductive,I will never think of Faeries in the same way! The Immortal Highlander will seduce you as it leads you across time and space on a passionate adventure full of mythical beings and never-ending love. I will go back and read the rest of the series because I enjoyed Moning's style of writing. She has a wonderful talent for blending fantasy with reality. Thank you for introducing me to the Highlander series.
2,Could have been better.,"I must admit, Adam sounded delicious and there were some parts that were funny. However, Gabby was a little annoying. There also wasn't much meat to the story line. It could have been a lot better. Wasted potential to say the least on this one."
5,great read,i love this book because it makes me wanna be in the storyline . i think all karen marie monings books will do that . if you havent read any of her books you should .
3,Yummy!,"KMM writes books to lose yourself in. Her men are SO gorgeous you need to stop and get a glass of water!!! This was a delightful one day read on a rainy day with a cup of tea.This particular Highlander is out of the world, literally and in his human form is quite the temptor! This book was enjoyable, nothing too taxing and just an sweet read!"
3,Disappointing read from a phenomenal author,"I was fascinated with Adam Black from the very beginning, so I've been anticipating his story for a long time. Unfortunately, there was a surprising lack of sizzle between Adam and Gabby. This is not a problem I usually find in Ms. Moning's books."
5,I love Adam Black!,"I've always loved Karen's portrayal of that mischevious fay, Adam Black, and I was so happy to see him get his own story.Adam's heroine is every bit as fiesty as he is and I really enjoyed their little spats.Karen's humour always keeps me on my toes as do her characters. An enjoyable read from beginning to end."
5,Simply Fantastic!!,"I had been looking forward to this book coming out for a long time and it was certainly worth the wait! Adam Black is the most darkly sensual ""Highlander"" yet - and has met his perfect match in Gabrielle. I also liked the fact that Ms. Moning included characters from her previous books. This book has a truly beautiful ending too. Now the wait begins until the next one comes out....sigh..."
2,A much anticipated let down,"I was really let down. Her series had been one of my absolute favorites and it seemed that she just went for the quick sell. Maybe it was the pressure of coming out in hard back. Also it was far too few pages. One of her earlier novels had a preview of what she had been working on for the Adam Black novel but that was not what she wrote. Please Ms. Moning, a most fervent plea: Try again. I really enjoy your books and know you have got that special something, this just wasn't it..."
1,Disappointed ( such a waste of a good character),"What did she do to Adam Black?!?! One of my favorite characters and she gave him one of the worst story lines. I was hoping for something so much more, and kept reading hoping it would get better. I didn't! At least I only wasted time and not money (saved money by checking it out at the library)."
3,Disappointed,"I really enjoyed Dark Highlander so... I wish there had been more character development. Adam was thousands of years old now he was human.. So, I wished the book had detailed a little bit more on what he was going through along with his new found lust as a human. Adam Black just seemed like there should have been more to him than the sex crazed alpha male. The story had potential but it wasn't for me."
2,Really disapointed,"I was looking forward to this book after reading The Dark Highlander, I ordered it months ago. I have to say I was also disapointed.I felt it was skimpy on the pages...like about 40 pages too short and the story line felt rushed. One moment they're in NYC and then they are in Scotland. It was a lot of what my past english teachers would call 'telling not showing'. I agree with what another posted said about rushing for a deadline. I normally buy UBS and only buy hardcover if I really like the author. Next time I'll wait for used paperback on this author before buying a new hardcover."
3,A Disappointment,I am Karen Marie Monings biggest fan. I absolutle love the way she writes and her stories are very good. But I was disappointed with The Immortal Highlander because it was so short. I mean Moning's books are usually longer and the story is paced much slower. While in this one I felt like everything was rushed. I waited forever for this new romance to come out and I'm sad to say it was not worth the wait.
3,decent,"I read the entire series in one week from Beyond the Highland Mist to the Immortal Highlander. It wasn't difficult. All the books were ""easy reads--fluff books."" Which can be enjoyable in their own right. Perhaps because I read them all at once made me not enjoy them as much. I noticed while reading that every book had the same basic principle. Time travel, fall in love, someone jealous want't to kill the girl, day is saved, the end. It got to the point I was getting confused between what, or who, was in which book. Most of the girls were also similar in looks and just alike in personality. The men were all the same, too--brawny, tall, black hair, and massively in love and faithful. All the girls were virgins. I guess if I spent a year in-between books, I might not have noticed the repetitiveness as much, but it truely spoiled it for me."
3,Disappointing.,"I'm sorry, but given what a magnificent character Adam has been in previous books, I expected much more from this one, where Adam is the central character. To be fair, previously Adam has been this ""larger than life"" character, and perhaps no book could do him justice. However, this book clearly fell short of the mark. His background, his ""life"" story and his character motivation were hardly fleshed out at all. We're given brief, very unsatisfying ""glimpses"" into his past. As a result, we're left not really understanding what makes Adam tick. As a consequence, his lightning-quick decision to give up immortality to be with Gabrielle rings false.Also, the laws of Moning's world of the Fae isn't clearly drawn, and is making less and less sense. Sure, this is all make-believe, but it should still be logical. The whole issue of Adam not having a soul, but then mysteriously acquiring one, presumably because Gabby wished for it hard enough....simply silly."
2,frustrating- not part of series,This book belongs in its own series. I loved the other books and purchased it in the hopes that it was similar. And the story line bored and frustrated me.
5,Breathtaking!!,"I loved this book. I read it in one sitting. I am a great fan of Lisa Kelypas, Loretta Chase, Sabrina Jefferies, Liz Carlye, Victoria Alexander,and Stepanie Lauens. I am happy to say that Karen Moning is now part of the list. This is the third Highlander novel in her series I have read, I have no complaints. The last chapter took my breath away!"
2,What the hell are you talking about???,"I will give'em a few great characters and some decent dialogue, but this story is probably the most offensive and poorly thought out piece I've ever read (aside from Felice Picano's Like People In History.) Now, there are many people who will relate to this book on a very base level and for that reason will recommend it and talk lovingly about it, but the writing style isn't ""good"" and the ""message"" is pathetic. Having been witness to kids much like these (and the adult's they've become), I can't even begin to tell you how disheartening it is to have to read another story about them. And you, maple syrup boy, put your thing away and read some Irvine Welsh."
1,infocam,"I purchased this pen last weekend, installed it, but when I tried to scan a sentence from a book that I was reading, I kept getting this:Atly advocates O ~""e""~~'N'''""""tca~~?l~v2~J lrly adAocvVGe o~ tpG eocls~ luoqGI (IGEUGq Tw~uc y?4~ edical issue, and concentrated instead on disabilityl as a `cial1 `_~ boTIu~bEIGuolrl~ulJu. ?one trly sgAocsV~e o~ Veg eoc?sl woq~I qGeuGg !DJbS!~IUGU~ &~~'S 15 .vf11 ? cf cEnGq order to grasf) IS A~lqGI~ s~EnGqNot worth the price for a pen that doesn't scan well. It is better to type your own document than waste hours of trying to scan a page."
1,Not worth the trouble,"This item does work, but you have to scan very, very slowly and carefully or you end up with a garbled mess. I type faster than that!"
1,wizcom,This is virtually useless as you could copy the desired area of print faster than scanning and your hand must be totally steady.
4,Nice Feel to it!!,"This album signifies a change in the way they do music. Ben had just recovered from his rare disorder and that may have been a ""born again"" calling in terms of the duo's popularity. The remix of the song ""Missing"" was evident of that. The album in general is still worth while. I love the track's ""Rollercoaster"", ""Troubled Mind"" and the non-mix version of ""Missing"", though the remix is o.k. Recommended!!"
2,Walking Wounded did it better,"The non-remixed version of Missing is one of the most touching, haunting depictions of lost love ever recorded. Alas, the rest of Walking Wounded is - despite Tracey Thorn's incredible voice and Ben Watts charming musical arrangements - uninspiring and frankly unmemorable. It lacks the lyrical bite and the slow-burning darkness that made their following album (1996's Walking Wounded) such brilliance."
5,Perfection....,"There are few albums that are truly perfect, but this one is an exception.Absolutely beautiful recordings from every angle.Great break-up and LIVE AGAIN music!~!!1"
4,Amplified Angst,"Just over a month ago, I ordered this CD from Amazon. So far, Roller Coaster and Troubled Mind are my favorite songs on this CD. They're beautiful and I listen to them repeatedly. I also listen to Get Me. I don't think I've discovered all the songs I will fall in love with on this CD yet--so I may update this review in the future."
2,This CD is Bland,"I sincerely hope that you got the newest version of this CD that has both the regular version of missing and the Todd Terry Remix which is the one they play on the radio. All of these songs are about the same thing, you left me, and now I'm sad. They are BORING! There is absolutely nothing to them! If you like Missing, don't buy this CD, buy one of those Dance compilations that has it. If you want some good EBTG stuff, then get Walking Wounded."
2,Whatever....,"Tracey Thorn has a great voice, but most of the lyrics are pretty much like a lot of other pop music. Aside from the mix of ""Missing"" there isn't much to recommend this over a lot of other really good pop. This was my first EBTG .. and probably my last. It's OK, but pretty bland."
1,Amplified What?,"This album is pretty much known for ""missing"" and that's what it should be known for. It's a very good song and it's the only good song on this entire album. I have listened to this many times, but I just can't get into it."
4,Easy listening music that provokes good feelings,"A superb blend of original, yet simple, arrangements. The melodies stick with you and the music plays over and over in my head for hours. I had given up hope that any modern band had any talent until I heard EBTG. Now there isn't a day that goes by that I don't have one of their CDs playing in my car. Give it a try and let it grow on you. Don't mind the bad reviews from empty-header, talentless magazine reviewers... they missed the boat on this band!!"
5,Amplify Your Heart with this CD!,"This album is by far the most cherished CD of my entire CD collection! I am a total EBTG fan and love all their work. But because this album was the last of the non-electronic productions they put out, I believe it truly allows for an appreciation of their lyrics and accoustic arrangements. Tracy's voice is so soothing and the instruments blend so perfectly and harmoniously to create classic pieces that speak straight to the heart. If you don't own it, it's time you do!"
5,MUST HAVE,"I have read some pretty lame reviews about this CD, but Amplified Heart is an album one can listen to everyday with a glass of wine and a good friend. You can play it from start to finish and relax while daily stress blends away. If you've ever had a shaky romance, this album will answer your questions and bring you back to being sane. EBGT produced a classic."
4,Passionate and Honest Emotion,Break out the candles and wine with this CD - even alone. A great CD to listen with you're in a pensive and thoughtful mood. And an even better CD to create of a comfortable atmosphere for talking with friends. BUY IT!!!
5,"Not quiet Idelwild, but still a 5 star rating.","This is the last great EBTG. It's very close to Idelwild as being the best that they have done. It doesn't have the feeling of nostalgia that permeate songs in Idelwild like ""Oxford Street"" and ""Lonsome For A Place I Know"", but the lyrics are still very fine indeed. The playing is very stong on AH, maybe the best they have done."
5,Beautiful music,I bought this for my husband. He loves the music. This is a great blend of extraodinary talent ...very romantic and the lyrics just move you. So beautiful. I would highly recommend this.
3,Hmmmm....,"Not what I thought it was going to be. I like only about 4 of the 20+ tracks on this CD. I shoudl have just bought the DVD instead and actually watched them perform. Much, much more entertaining."
2,Displeased w/ the 3 tenors cd,"My package arrived on time,in excellent condition,no problem with the seller as far as billing,etc. But-when I played it-it is not the 3 tenors singing together,but rather each one singing individually.If I had wanted that I would have ordered solo albums .Also..it is only select songs and excerpts ...not the concert in its entirety. I felt scammed."
3,I have some complaints......,"...about Luciano Pavarotti's collaboration with SO MANY pop stars. He's just sung with TOO MANY OF THEM! He should ease off on that and just stick to opera arias and not get too caught up in the act. No offense to you fans if you like him, I know you think he's great and all that, as are Domingo and Carreras, the nicest voiced out of the three. I'm just expressing my opinions."
5,Fabulous!!!!,"A must have, will create a fan for tenors for anyone! Even our children have grown to love this one. Ages 6 & 8, they choose to listen to this collection. The richness of the tenors voices beautiful, yet uniquely individual with little sample of their famous works is very enjoyable. ""A Tribute to Hollywood"" was fun, while Nessun Dorma stirs the blood!"
3,A love-hate relationship,"The original tracks on the CD sound outstanding in their remastered format. However, the new bonus tracks, recorded about 20 years later, relatively stink. They are badly produced and once you've heard one, you've heard them all.For the right price, the quality and sound of the original tracks can make it a good deal."
4,a much missed 80's staple,"Always loved this ""cassette"" back in the early 80's. C'est impossible is still pretty cool.Although, hearing some of it again. the Warble get's a little old.. If you've heard them you know what I mean.great to have this one again."
5,Best Catholic Schoolgirl Band Ever,"Garage band sensibilities meet suburban kitsch meet catchy pop tunes. Most people either love or hate singers with vibrato. The lead singer of this band has crazy mad vibrato, so if you aren't a vibrato fan, you want to give them a miss.On the other hand if you like vibrato and like the garage band sound, this is a great album."
2,"Sorry, but I don't get it","I bought this on a whim because I remembered seeing them in the early '80s. I listened to it several times and there are one or two good songs, but the rest is pretty generic rock & roll. I don't see what the fuss is about."
2,Over-hyped!,"Poorly apeing early Blondie and the Go-Gos with unimaginative surfer-girl drum-machine drumming and horribly warbly leading vocals, the Catholic Girls' pedestrian and simplistic rock-n-roll left me cold (could you tell?)."
1,I Inteviewed This Band...Nice Girls,"I saw this band in early 1983 at Rockers in Houston. My buddy and I interviewed them for the college radio station we were working at and the girls were really nice. I think one of them liked me and was going to invite me and my buddy for a late night breakfast at Denny's. But the damn road manager squelched the invite. I think the bass player liked my stupid new wave haircut. In this regard, I wish they would've been more like the Go Go's. The thought of discussing post-Stalinist Russia economics while eating pancakes would've been fun. Damn road managers...they spoil everything!"
1,I was warned by a bad review..,"I was warned by a bad review of this book, and bought it anyway because I liked the Gospel According to Peanuts by the same author.Short has become an apostate. This book amoung other things claims that satan doesn't really exist, and is just another side of the almighty God.I assure you satan does exist, and is going to be shortly bound a thousand years. This isn't a Christian book.Which is too bad, because it takes away from Charles Shultz own Christian cartoons, and in particular the much beloved Christmas special, A Peanuts Christmas.I suggest getting that video, and ignoring this book."
1,Another below average album,"Nu-metal sucks and is dead as is rap and grunge but this album is just a below average album from and below average band. Much better new true thrash bands out there like Violator, Havok, Ravage, Toxic Holocaust, Municiple Waste and better pioneers of thrash like Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax and Metallica."
5,Hard Times on Planet Earth,"I am touched at the Poet's combination of style of music to the tone of his poems. His poetry is deep, reflective, heart opening and soul touching. Surely a poet for the new millenium as we are all indeed experiencing ""Hard times on planet Earth"". I feel the poet's compassion and love for humankind encompassing our vulnerabilities and strengths. Truly a master of emotion. I look forward to more of this artist's work!"
2,Wish I could take it back,"Since this was recommended by a guy who worked in the paint and stain department at a local Menards, I thought great! Now, not so much. First, once you assemble the pole attachment it doesn't come apart again...I had to call Wagoner to find this out. So much for easy storage. And that fancy little brush that's attached for the purpose of getting in between the deck boards? Forget about it--because it doesn't. The flow knob works okay, but you have to constantly adjust it and more importantly remember to close it. This product is really just kind of a pain. A regular paint pad on an extension pole would work just as well and not cost as much."
1,Buyer Beware,"We bought one over the weekend and while my husband was using it the handle snapped (where the metal meets the stain bin) and pinched his finger, ripping the tip almost off. We ended up at the hospital and 6 stitches later, I had to finish with a brush. Not worth the price or the hassle. Plus, Wagner customer service won't even talk to us! I wouldn't even give this 1 star!"
1,You get what you payfor!!! CHEAP=POOR QUALITY,This came with the back yard combo kit and it is very flimsy! (Feels a lot like a swiffer sweeper handle if you know what I mean)The handle broke in half 3/4 of the way through my project. It is very difficlut to control the flow of stain to the pad. You would be better off using a short nap roller on a pole than this thing! Stay away!
1,"Wagner took my money and wasted my time, shame!","Bought this at Menards, it's a piece of junk! Seriously do not purchase it. Frustrating regulating flow besides the control being in an awkward place. Used it by letting some stain out than shutting off and dipping it in a tray of stain, pad was showing signs of wear after a 3' x 15' area. Ended up using a roller made of foam for textured ceilings, attached to a broom handle, worked nice(the roller) still went between boards and evened it out and worked it in with a brush, did this with DeckMate also. And the brush to go between boards on the pad did not work so good and got in the way. Never even wasted mineral spirits to clean it, its garbage. I do and have done a lot of painting and staining in my life, and will never buy another Wagner product. Wish I had read reviews here before purchasing."
1,cheated,"Seemed like great idea when I read the catalog description.I suspected that there were going to be problems when I saw the warning not to move the valve setting until the ""tool"" was assembled.That was confirmed when the valve assembley and spring fell on the floor when I took that section out of the box.Never did get it to work properly. Gave up and finished with a brush.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
4,Pretty good,"Better than staining by hand, not as quick as sprayer. I use a thick stain and it takes several ""swipes"" to get enough stain to come out.But, being able to stand makes it worthwhile."
3,cant turn off,"Loads easy, seemed would work well.BUT getting it to turn off is near impossible. For a apparently easy tool it didnt work feed way expected. What a mess - too too much stain came out ..ended up dipping the head in paint pan to apply and gave up on the tank feed"
1,you can have mine,I never actually used the deckmate. I followed all directions and could not get the stain to flow to the pad. I called customer service and was instructed to press the tank all the way down the pole- there is no reference to this in the directions. The girl at customer service told me it had been a long time since she had read the manual. I was able to push the tank down but this takes a great deal of force. I tried it with water and did get a flow. I wish this was all in the manual because I had already applied the stain with a brush at this point and spent less time applying the stain by brush than the time I spent fooling around with the deckmate.
1,Don't waste your money,This is one of the worst products I have ever tried to use. Semi-transparent stain clogged the feed tube within 2 minutes of the first filling. And it leaks. Save yourself the aggrivation and just plan to use a brush.
4,Fascinating & stimulating,"This book gives insight in many discussions on business, theology and philosophy among five extraordinary people. But I find it regrettable that the belief of Edison, Ford & Lindbergh in reincarnation is rather superficially worked out. Perhaps because of the religious stance of his wife and the author.I deem it also regrettable that no mention is made of the membership of Edison of the Theosophical Society while it is obvious he was much inspired by the books of Blavatsky.Apart from a few inaccuracies (on p. 10: Edison is attributed to have received as a gift every new car that ran from the Ford assembly line, among which the first V8. But the V8 was introduced after the demise of this great inventor, p. 100) I find this book very readable and stimulating."
5,"Memorable men, friendships, and faith make a memorable read!","I found this book to be a great read! Newton does a fine job communicating the characters of the men that he worked with, revealing their work ethic and their faith and what made them the men they were.I found this book to be such a pleasure that I ended up buying copies for several friends as well as my Dad."
5,An authentic view on historical people - BRAVO !,"I was very impressed by James Newton's personal involvement in the lives of these significant people. Apart from the importance of each of the 5 friends, which has lead me to pursue more learning about them, Newton has something to share with us - giving of self. All throughout his life he gave his friends total and unconditional friendship. In return, they did the same, probably because they missed this level of honesty in so many of their relationships...A very good read and a very enjoyable trip through recent history !"
5,Great Dad gift!,"I purchased this book for my Dad who is an avid history buff whose favorite topic is generally Henry Ford and Thomas Edison, and he found that there was so much he didn't know already that he learned about these men from this book. Great purchase, very well put together. I would recommend it for any history lover!"
3,Funny cops and robbers with a touch of romance,"This is movie I saw when it was first release and at a low point in my life. Seeing this movie lifted my spirits. I was funny, proved that crime doesn't pay and love is possible even among cops. It is very entertaining and worth seeing over and over."
5,Hoosier reviewer,"Fantastic movie if you want some good, clean comedy. Hilarious plot and excellent mesh of characters."
3,A Stoned DeLuise Laughing A Classic,"It's funny how it was decades since viewing this movie again but I always remembered and liked best was Dom DeLuise experimenting and lighting up a joint, and then laughing hysterically. That laugh put me in tears. Twenty years after I first saw this film (at the theater), I still chuckle at Dom's laugh.He's still fun to watch as are his partners in crime in this story: Suzanne Pleshette, Jerry Reed and Ossie Davis. Actually, DeLuise, Reed and Pleshette play undercover cops in a sting operation, if you can believe that! The only negative for me was hearing nice-guy Dom use the Lord's name in vain so much in this film, at least early on,If you enjoy seeing oddball characters, you'll like this comedy crime caper. It certainly has it's share of wackos."
5,Quite possibly the funniest movie I've ever seen,"The movie disc itself was in excellent condition, as was the case, exactly as advertised. I love this movie dearly, and I have been searching for it for years, so finding it was a wonderful event! It played great, the picture was marvelous, and I love it even more than I did when I first saw it!An absolute must-have for anyone who loves great comedy with some of the best actors and actresses to ever walk the stage!"
5,Awesomely Funny Movie,This has been one of my favorite movies for years and I was happy to finally get a copy of it on DVD. It still makes me laugh after all these years.
3,My Lexmart All-In-One,"Considering this is the third Lexmark All-In-One I have purchased, suffice it to say, it is clearly problems with the Lexmark brand. The first one ended up not being compatible with an upgrade I made in Windows, the second one malfuctioned due to what might have been a defficient ink cartridge, and am having similar problems with this one. Print catridges carriage tends to jam when I change one, there appears to be inferior printing on certain paper sizes, and the unit itself occasionally freezes up when I turn on my computer."
3,OK Machine For The Light User,"This printer came free bundled with my laptop so I can't complain about the price. It offers a lot of functionality: fax, printer, copier, scanner. However, cartridges are costly to replace ([...]) and don't last long. To make it last longer, I've resorted to setting the ink quality to Quick Print for daily printing (I don't use it for images). I also use Costco to do ink refills for these cartridge at 1/3 the cost of new. The HANDSET on mine has very low volume. I can barely hear the person on the other end and there's no volume setting for it that I can see. The FAX has trouble detecting an incoming fax so occasionally needs to be manually answered. It's irritating, but manageable since I mostly send rather than receive. Overall, it does the job for the light user. It's a cheap, quick fix for someone desperate to get an All-in-1 printer, but I wouldn't rely on it for heavy uses."
1,Doesn't FAX,"I am unable to fax anything out, although I can receive faxes. Copies well but otherwise, a poor investment."
2,Lexmark x4270,"This All-in-one printer is fairly easy to use. Gives you options to change print speed depending on the print quality. However, It is not very durable. The output tray which catches the print job broke off. Also, I am unable to print. I bought new cartridges and still nothing printed. I cleaned the cartridges with wet paper towels as suggested by tech support to unclog the ink wells. Still no dice!"
3,misleading,"I bought what I thought was a NEW printer. When it arrived it had stickers all over it saying it was a reconditioned printer from the manufacturer. I was very upset as I felt I had been mislead and was never told it was reconditioned - it said NEW. I wanted to return it but I desperately needed a printer I did not have the time to fool with returning it and waiting to get another. So, I kept it. The printer itself has worked fine but I feel like I can't trust Amazon anymore!!!!!"
3,Great job as a scanner - haven't tried printing,"As a multi-page scanner, it works pretty well. It often makes 1 out of 30 pages crooked, but otherwise is really speedy and the software interface is pretty good. It whines if you don't install printer cartridges, but will still function w/o them installed if you ignore the nags, unlike some other brands that will stop dead in their tracks. Haven't had a good record w/their flatbed scanners, but this seemed better constructed."
3,Adequate all-in-one,"Given the relatively low price of this machine, you need to temper your expectations for this. As a previous Lexmark owner, I wanted to get another Lexmark that used the same size 70/71 cartridges because I found this size to be readily available at places like Costco, Walmart, and Target.This machine does an adequate job for light usage. Since I only use this for copying, printing, and faxing documents, I changed the print settings to black & white only. I find that this increases print speed and reduces overall printing costs. It clearly is not the best all-in-one out there, but, for the price, it does a satisfactory job."
1,Junk,"I bought this **** out of desperation as my girlfriend needed a ""do everything"" printer to apply for a job. I never liked Lexmark and now doubly so. The print quality went down fast, in just weeks. Buy new cartriges? Didn't help and now it won't print anything. The only thing this piece of **** will do now is SEND a fax. That's it. Stay away from Lexmark."
1,AWFUL,"I don't know how many times I had to turn this machine off and on just to clear it. Would constantly get ""hung up"" when using ANY of the functions: faxing, receiving, scanning, printing, copying. Ink ran out without warning and WAY before it should have. Spend so much time re-doing everything."
1,Worse than useless,"I would have to agree with ""working engineer."" This software is worse than useless due to its positional inaccuracy. I was shocked to find that my 76csx showed the location of my house as several hundred feet from its actual location. A downloaded track of a run in a local park showed this same ""offset."" I tried an experiment: created a waypoint by standing in the middle of an intersection in my neighborhood, then downloading it. The MapSource Topo US 2008 software showed an offset error of about 800 feet. Google earth showed it dead on (so I knew it wasn't a problem with the GPS unit itself). My older version of NG's Topo! also shows this waypoint at its proper location at the intersection. Interestingly enough, Delorme Topo 6.0 has the same offset error as the Garmin mapping software."
3,"Load to GPS, use a different program","Let me break down the 3 rating:Product scores a 5 in the ability to load TOPO maps onto my Garmin GPS.Product scores a 1 in the mapping software features, usability, and trip planning ability.If you want maps on your Garmin GPS this is your only option, and that part works great. If you want decent mapping software to plan trips, analyze terrain, store multiple trips, etc... I would recommend Delorme's Topo software."
4,"Works well, very helpful","This is an immense improvement over the last version of the topo, which had almost no roads listed by name. The product is easy to use, is intuitive, and makes mapping out routes, seeing trails taken, and finding GPS coordinates a cinch.My only complaints:1) its 100K:1 so the detail is obviously lacking. It's good enough for basic stuff, but there are times that I'm kayaking thru solid/wetlands, or there are streams shown on the map that sure are invisible to my eyes.2) it still seems not to be fully up to date, be it water, land or streets. Its certainly not up to date as of late 2007.But, overall it adds a lot of extra value to having a GPS on the water and trail, and I make heavy use of it."
3,Garmin topo 2008,"The 100,000 scale is a definite drawback for walking or paddling. I do not understand why they have not released a 24,000 scale version. I found quite a few errors in streams, lakes, and even some roads that have been there for years. In communication with Garmin they told me it was because they used US topo maps as the source documents. When I checked my old paper maps the errors were not there. Better than nothing but I really hope they release an updated version with the smaller scale."
2,Wildly off track,"In my local area (San Francisco Peninsula) the correspondence between the Topo U.S. 2008 maps and physical reality are off by from 200 to 500 feet! When I play my tracks against Google Earth (a nice Mapsource feature, BTW) they are bang on, but way off on the Mapsource depiction. I'm very reluctant to trust my life to this inaccurate mapping product, even more so in sparsely populated and back country areas where the location of streams and cliffs would be important to know accurately.I'm using the new eTrex Vista HCx unit which I like very much.Compiling map sets to upload to the GPS can take hours if a lot of segments are involved, and there are limitations to the number of map segment and file sizes the unit will accept. So I bought three 1GB micro SD cards and can fit the entire US (lower 48 states) mapset in three chunks (West, Midwest and East), each with less than 2000 map segments and file size less than 1GB."
2,Garmin mapsource topo us 2008,"Even on my pc, the detail is pretty poor.(like where a creek name goes to,lack of trails and roads) It's even worse on my handheld gps. I'll wait for a 1 to 24000 scale for my particular region."
3,Good topo details but no street index,"I bought this product with the garmin 60CSX. I used to have a magellan platinum with the topo software and it did come with street index and street search, the garmin topo doesn't. I didn't expect to have turn by turn directions but a street map is quite worthless without an index. It is impossible to find a secondary street in a city without a paper map which wouldn't be sold without a street index! Even the computer software doesn't have it. You have to search the coordinate on maporama and then enter the waypoint on the GPS... I guess they want to sell both topo and city navigation maps. The later is over the top for my use."
2,Trouble Transfering MapsTo GPS Micro Data Card,I could not transfer topo maps to my Garmin Etrex Vista micro data card. I had to go buy a card reader in order to transfer topo maps to the data card. The software Help was no help in fiquring out why the transfer did not work to the micro card. I could transfer maps to the Vista but the program did not recognize the data card. Garmin's Support page was no help and I emailed Garmin Support for help which they promised to answer within 3 days. I did not receive a reply from Garmin Support. The maps are better than the base map that comes with the Vista but the maps are old and the product overall is of poor and dated quality.
5,Garmin Mapsource TOPO,"An excellent product at an excellent price. If you're into off road GPS use, this is the best product for your Garmin hand-held unit."
3,Problem installing software to PC,The software is great but I was unable to install it. I had to spend over an hour with the Garmin help desk and they finally installed the product using some back door after giving the rep access to my pc. There was some issue with the Install Shield.
5,i found myself!,The last version I had was 2005. This has excellent graphics and much improved maps. Would definitely recommend
4,Garmin Mapsource Topo 2008,"This product seems to have everything that I need to keep my gps adventureson track. Going with the cd version for the computer and downloading maps as I need them works well. This also lets me upload tracks and waypointsonto my computer to store and plan routes, and connect waypoints with pictures or web links. I haven't had any problems with this software so far. There also is a link to view your map and waypoints on google earth.(this requires a download from google) but is a very cool feature.This software has many features which I haven't yet explored them all but most of the usual items are self explanatory."
1,"Oudated info, over-priced","I've caught several major highways that were moved 4 years ago, and they are outdated on the topos. They don't include State Wildlike Management areas, and the detail is pretty lacking. Not worth the money."
2,Look at other Topo map products before buying this one,"Having topo maps on the GPS screen while hiking is something which, now that I've had it, I'll never go without. However this is not the map product I would buy today.Consider instead Garmin's 24k maps, rather than this set of 100k maps. The resolution in the newer (24k) maps is better, more like what you get with USGS 7.5' quad maps/NG Topo/DeLorme Topo.Note that Garmin products purchased for one GPS unit can NOT be transferred to a new/replacement unit (except by Garmin via warranty replacement). Garmin's anti-piracy ""unlock"" procedure is archaic and tedious. If you ever upgrade your Garmin, you must buy your maps again. One ""unlock code"" is assigned to one USB-connected GPS device, by serial number, and cannot be changed.If you're looking for the GPS that works with National Geographic's Topo! maps, that's a Magellan."
2,Garmin MapSource Topo US 2008,"I purchased this 2008 TOPO software because I did not have the latest version of base maps for Geocaching. After a month of not being able to load the software or read it on my eTrex Legend CX, I was told by Garmin that the units card reader ""might"" not be working. I'm completely frustrated with Garmin and the time it has taken for them to work this issue. So I returned the eTrex to the store it was purchased and got my money back.The software seems like it works on my computer; however, since the purpose of this software is to transfer and help guide on a Garmin GPS - it FAILS.Unfortunely Garmin Software does not work on other ""outdoor"" GPS units. As you know once software is opened you cannot return it."
2,Not hardly worth it for the Idaho Panhandle,"1.) The fire road data is woefully incomplete, and some of the roads it knows about don't actually exist, which shouldn't happen as road beds just don't just disappear overnight.2.) The colors are such that it's tough to distinguish a fire-road from a primary elevation line.3.) It can't navigate to trailheads on fire-roads.4.) Even if you buy a big memory chip, the software will only let you move a fraction of the US to your GPS. And if you want to change maps, you get to start over, which could be an hour-long download to your GPS.All in all, I wish I'd investigated some of the free topo tools and data rather than buying this."
2,Astoundingly Inaccurate in places,"I wanted something other than the base map that is built into my GPSMap 76CSx. I admit that I have not spent much time with this so far, but my initial impression is pretty bad. Until I ordered this product, I had been driving around San Diego, recording my tracks. When I loaded this product, I was startled to see how far off my tracks are in some places from the roads indicated on the map. For example, the east end of Sorrento Valley Blvd is pretty good. The west end of this road appears in this map a full 1000 feet (Yes. One thousand!) to the south of the actual road! It's not like there is an overall shift of coordinates or anything like that. The roads are right in some places, and then just wander off."
5,Garmin Mapsource Topo U.S. 2008,"The Mapsource software was just like advertised, Product does everything plus more than I need. Price was great, but shipping was pains takingly slow (eight days), the product shipped from Missouri, and I live in Kentucky (one state away) that was an unreasonable amount of time. Payment was easy with fair communications."
4,Worthy upgrade to basemap,I have the Garmin Hcx Vista. The Topo is a great upgrade to the basemap. I just wish the Vista would allow me to download the entire map. A good thing compared to other Garmin map products is this map data does not require any unlocking procedures.
3,so far so good,"the topo usa 2008 maps for my Nuvi 200w Garmin gps seem adequate. being new to using a gps and not hard copy maps, the medium is somewhat confusing at times, and frustrating when trying to view overall scope and detail at the same time, as one can do on a regular topo map."
3,Garmin MapSource Topo US 2008 Review - Part Number: 010-11001-00,"This is a good product and works well using my Palm 750 running Microsoft Mobile O/S using the Garmin Mobile 10 Receiver. Unfortunately, the maps lack detail and lack hiking trails in many parks. I would purchase this product again but only at the discounted web rate of $59.10 that I found on Amazon, not the U.S. List Price: $116.65 from Garmin's website."
2,Roads are not accurate,I purchased this map to update the maps that came on my Garmin GPS. The original maps had roads that have not been updated in 20+ years. When I added the new map I learned that the local roads are inaccurate by 400 to 600 feet. I asked Garmin and was told that roads are just for reference. This map is only good for Topo and little else.
2,Topo 2008,This does not provide the detail you normall get from a TOPO map. I found trails and roads missing. For a general map of the area it is OK and that sll it is good for.I would not recomend buying it because of its limitations.
2,Disappointing,"This product is pretty close to worthless. There isn't nearly enough detail to actually be meaningful. I intended to use this software for backcountry hunting. The few roads and trails that does show are nearly indistinguishable from other features on the map. The only good thing I have the say about this software is that it's better than nothing, but not much. A standard printed topo map is much more useful and accurate."
2,Garmin Topo US 2008,"Garmin Topo US 2008 is a big disappoint. I have owned and used Garmin United States Topo for quite a few years and often wondered when Garmin would announce a new Topo product. Unfortunately Topo US 2008 is not much different than their old version. The terrain shading (only viewed on your computer, not on your Garmin Unit) is the only difference I can see, with the exception of a few more trails and roads added in (though still missing many other topographical points).If you already own Garmin's older version of United States Topo don't bother purchasing Topo 2008 unless you really need ""Terrain Shading"".If you don't own a previous version of US TOPO then I would recommend this product."
1,Useless if you have Garmin street maps,"I had heard that this is a useful complement to the Garmin US Street Maps. My view is that is us useless as a companion. Huge amount of memory is taken up on the street maps, which are redundant if you have City Navigator NT. Then, the scale of the topo maps (1:100,000) turns out to be useless for hiking purposes. This was just a mistake to get."
2,"Garmin TOPO Software, terrible for Geocaching","This software is semi-useless for Geocaching (and probably other useage). Many major highways 5-6 years old are not included. In an expanding urban enviornmental area, few things added or changed in the past 5 years are included. I often find muself driving down the middle of someone's cornfield, according to TOPO U.S. 2008. A big waste of money, as far as I am concerned. Since, unfortunately, you are stuck with Garmin, for mapping software, pay the extra and get Streets and trips."
4,Great update,"This update takes care of a lot of newer things, but it still is not up to date. There are a number of major businesses (Costco for example) that are not included even if they have been open for a year. Otherwise easy to follow and use."
2,Doesn't seem to be very accurate,"I installed these maps on my Garmin eTrex Legend HCx. The installation was straightforward, but quite time consuming. The problem seems to be with the accuracy of the roads on the map. The vessel is almost always way off the road -- probably 30 to 50 feet. Sometimes so far off that it is difficult to tell which street it is on. I called Garmin and they said that this is normal (???) I tried the Garmin City Navigator maps on this unit and they are spot on. The Garmin consultant said that the Topo 24K maps are as well, but I have no experience with these. So, I would say this is a questionable product, not up to any reasonable standard of accuracy. If you are interested in off-road usage for your GPS, you might look elsewhere."
1,Garmin update a waste of money.,"I used to like my Garmin, that is until I updated it. Ever since it has been slow and erroneous to the point that it is too frustrating to use. I borrowed my son,s Tom-Tom for my latest trip tp Florida. Needless to say, my next GPS will be a Tom-Tom."
3,Garmin Topo 2008 US,"I bought Garmin Mapsource about 5 years ago with the garmin handleheld GPS. That one was really hard to use. About one year ago, I bought Nuvi 350. That one was easy to use and change my mind to continue to buy Garmin product. So I bought Garmin Topo 2008 for my new Garmin GPS. After I got it, I found that this one really disappointed me. The interface was pretty much the same and again hard to use. I hope Garmin can do some research to improve the interface and make it easy to use.Be aware that it has 2025 map set limit when you transfer map to your Garmin GPS. If you plan buy a micro SD card, 1gb will be fine since Garmin's limit is a little beyond 1GB. So even you buy a micro SD card with large memory, it doesn't use it at all."
3,"Streets not updated, but much better resolution of topo lines","I like this product. It is much better than the old topo software, but can't Garmin at least take the time to update the streets to make it easier to reference your position. Example: In my town, there is a subdivision that has been around for at least 4 years and none of the streets for that subdivision are indicated on the map. This is an area that used to have trails and now the trailheads have all moved, so it is confusing. But, the detail of the topo is much much better than the old software. I would also like to be able to increase the line width of the trails and roads or the lines should be darker or wider to begin with. They are very difficult to see on the topo maps."
2,Garmin Topo 2008,"I purchased the new release of Garmin Topo 2008 hoping it would fill all the gaps in the previous version. Since I am currently residing in Arizona, I use the updated program with a GPSmap 60CSx for hikes in the State. I had hoped the new version would improve on the shortcomings of the previous version where lots of well-documented trails/hikes were missing. Not so. Very little has changed in AZ, and I am thoroughly disappointed. Most of the trails/hikes that have been in existence in the State for years, are still missing. I would not recommend this program to any serious hiker.Claus Pohl"
3,Topo map,"I bought this product knowing 2 things, that it won't work on a MAC and that it should give more detail for the avid backpacker. Most people in Colorado need more detail than the 1:100,000 detail provided by this disk. But when this is all that is offered for your new Garmin GPS, you find a way to make do."
4,Great Product For Hikers,"This product is great for hikers, but I wish Garmin would combine the TOPO map software with the City Navigator Software, so those of us who like to drive and hike don't have to drop $200 and use two software packages. Regardless, it's great. It has a up to date street map and good TOPO information. I was disappointed that it didn't show hiking trails in my local area. I'll have to get separate paper maps for that I guess."
3,Many trails missing,"Purchased this product for the trails that are supposed to be included. We were to hike in the Ramapo Mountain Forest in northern New Jersey. None of the trails in the area are included in TOPO 2008. Buy the trail maps from the New York New Jersey Trail Committee. I wonder how many other trails are missing. Anyway the missing trails are published trails, so I thought they should be included."
5,A must for backpackers,"If you get a Garmin (recommend the 60 CSX) GPS, you have to get this software in order to go backpacking. It is very detailed, very accurate (READ THE INSTRUCTIONS), and simple to use. I will never be caught outside in the wilderness again without this. It is as vital to me as my water purification, and fire starting flint. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
2,Not an accurate map at all.,"This map is just not trust worthy. It's pity that Garmin makes good GPS but when you plot the recorded tracks over it's map, the two produce such a discrepancy that makes you wonder if it's the map or the GPS devices at fault. Then you map the track logs on Google Earth, you realize the GPS devices is not at fault."
1,Forget this TOPO!,"Been used to Delorme Topo.. Only got this because I had to have it with my Garmin GPS-60 hand held.. Very poor trails.. hard to tell anything.. Trails , gradients etc all look alike.. when they are there at all.. I read reviews and they were not good, but thought they were not right or this bad. Lots of 5,600 foot hills with not any gradients shown at all.. Maybe be great for some places, but in Four Corners USA, this product is pretty much useless. It may be Okay back East or where ever.. I wish I had never went with Garmin as it now all sets at home unusable to me.GO WITH ANOTHER BRAND.. I now am doing the DeLorme TOPO 7.0 USA And very pleased with it over the Garmin GPS-60 product.. This Hand held also requires you to purchase the TOPO software that does not even come with it. And it is POOR.My Advice.. Waste of money.. AVOID! Much better out there."
2,Inferior to competitiors products from four years ago.,"I recently switched from a Magellan Sportrak to Garmin Legend HCx GPS. I bought the corresponding Topo Map- Garmin Mapsource Topo U.S. 2008. While the contours are reasonable, the integration of the roads into the map is simply ridiculous. On a recent walk I took, it shows my track crossing a road that in reality I never get within 1/3 of a mile of. The actual road layout looked like they are from at least 10 years ago in my area. For curiosity I dug out my 2004 Magellan Topo 3D and plotted the same track. The information was correct. So as long as you have no need of how the terrain and roads are interrelated, this product is fine. But for those of us that do occasionally drive to a trail, or want to reach a civilized place while on a hike this product is of dubious value."
1,Software bugs fatal; BEWARE,"Simply unable to transfer any useful data to Garmin etrex vista. Software surprisingly useless. Tried many ways to modify parameters both with the unit and download wizard and this software seems to always end in ""communication error"" which is disappointing after a long download. Attempting to download for the Topo US 2008 CD also erases the database that comes on the unit!!! This leaves you with NO data in the GPS.National Geographic's mapping software not compatible with downloading but still is a seemingly more funcitonal product and actually works with the Garmin units."
3,Left Wanting,"The software is just okay. I was disappointed in its lack of detail such as trails not shown or only partially shown. This may be due to Mapsource being 1:100,000. It would be much more useful if it was 1:24,000. Mapsource is the only software my Garmin device will accept, so it is better than nothing."
4,Garmin MapSource Topo map of US,"The included topo maps are okay. A manual for the software is included on the CD and leaves a lot to be desired. I had one problem, and this may be due to my Garmin Vista GPS but I think it is the way Mapsource works. It is not expalined in the manual that if you download the maps of a state today and decide a week later you want to add more maps, when you add the second set of maps it over-writes the first set. When you download maps, only the last set you send to the GPS are stored in the micro-SD card of the GPS. It took about 20 minutes to downlaod the maps from 4 states into my GPS."
5,map source,"the map source is great. I do have a problem with billing, when i ordered map source it said 70 something and when the bill came with it i was blown away with 118.00. I am still waiting to see if it has been fixed."
2,"Dolls good, stands not so much.","The stands on which the dolls twirl are poorly engineered and far too fragile. The dolls will only stand and twirl in them with great care in balancing them, and one of them broke while trying to get the doll seated correctly in it.That said, the dolls themselves are easy to pose, and in our experience stayed in the pose in which they were placed. They're also dressed quite nicely for dancing.The dolls being nice saved this from having one star, but since the main selling points are the twirling bases (which were an overall bust) I can't in good conscience tell others that they should go our and grab these."
3,Dancing twin dolls,I purchased these for my little girl to have for her 12 Dancing Princess Castle. Most of the older sister dolls are hard to find or way to expensive. These dolls aren't battery operated like I assumed but sit on a stand that you push on a hard surface. I was kinda excited about that because I love toys that my daughter physically has to manipulate rather than pushing a button.Like many others we have had problems with the limbs on one of the dolls from the minute she was out of the box. The others limbs are perfect. I think there might be some manufacturing promblems with these because I have noted that others have had this problem. It's not from rough play like some have suggested because ours was like that straight from the box.I still think this is a good value for 2 barbies. They work really well with the castle when their limbs are kinda lose because the can sit on the furniture that came with the castle. Overall happy with dolls disappointed with the stand.
4,Takes a Bit of Effort,"But if you spend just a few minutes getting the stand in properly and the dolls snapped it, they really are fun. My 4 y/o have been using the stands as microphones for other Barbies and they've been pretty rough on them and they are fine. All in all, we have fun with them and they do work when used correctly."
2,Not a quality toy,"My daughter received these today for her birthday. The only support to hold the dolls up is a little tiny clip that the dolls leg snaps into and ones of ours has already broke. The dolls limbs are so loose that they don't stand up straight. The dolls will not stand up to dance around. They should have called this toy ""12 Falling Princesses"". What a total disappointment for little girls. Don't they test these toys before they market them? Don't waste your money unless you only want the dolls."
1,Bad product design,"My daughter also received this as a 4th birthday gift. It is a terrible design. The dolls flop over and do not snap into the stand. I thought they were battery operated, but you are suppose to make them dance by pushing them across the floor. However, they don't really twirl around like they are suppose to. I can't believe they can sell such poorly designed toys."
3,Poor design BUT still fun to play with,"As stated in previous reviews the design of this toy is really poor. The dancing stands are really dumb. Unless you put the dolls on just right they don't really work. My daughter never even plays with the stands.She does however, love these Barbies! She loves their hair, their costumes, everything! Everyday her and her sister play with them and the Princess Genevieve. A great buy--just don't expect a lot from the dance stands."
4,More than meets the eye,"When I ordered the product I was not aware that it was solely intended for the Sigma Telephoto lens product lines. I'm sure its a beautiful product that works in concert with the intended lens.My intention was to 2x my Sigma 18-200mm for macrophotography and was immediately discouraged upon receiving it and fiddling. However... It * does * work with the Sigma 18-200mm lens. Be aware that you must be extremely careful because you cannot fully retract the lens and ""Lock"" it in place.You may not be able to seat other Sigma lenses onto the 2x due to the depth of the internal condensor."
4,Best way to learn to speak!,"As with other Pimsleur language courses, this is a great way to pick up the correct pronunciation. Lithuanian is difficult for English speakers, and sounds different than many languages we're used to so these cassettes are even more helpful. It starts with very simple pronunciation, breaking words down into sounds and goes through various phrases and sentences good for travelers. It is all audio, no book really. I'm waiting for them to do a complete course in Lithuanian!"
2,Has Anyone Even Heard Of This Movie?,"Rugged Chip Mayer is an astronaut whose misfortune is to witness the last nuclear war from orbit and return to a desolate planet Earth.This movie seems very rare. No one has even wrote a review. I've seen it and I can tell you it is pretty boring. The cover looks good and on the back of it, it trys to convince you that it is better than the MAD MAX films. I knew that they would be wrong about that. But I didn't think they could be that wrong. Basically the only good parts is the sex scene and the ending when Chip Mayer battles Richard Moll.If you haven't seen this movie, and want to rent it. Then I suggest you rent it on a two-for-one night. I'm sure glad I did.I hope my review was helpful to you!"
1,Poor quality for what should be a simple tool,"On first use, the tape jammed and got stuck between the plastic frame, making it very difficult to wind the tape out or in. This is a poorly designed product. There doesn't seem to be any solution to the problem, and it has continued to happen for the months I have used it."
2,Doesn't go back in case,"This fish tape did exactly what I needed it to do and was a great bargain. However, I have unwound and rewound it a number of times trying to get it all back in the case and simply cannot do it. I can get most of it in, but there is about 4'-5' that is left hanging out. It's not that terrible because I just wrap it around the outside of the case."
5,"Costly, but then again.....","I had one of these, and a friend took it outdoors and TRASHED it, so i bought another one....the feel of this ball is second to none. The only thing you have to remember is that the break in period for this ball is LONG...if you don't play frequently, expect this thing to stay stiff for at LEAST two months...I play 4 times a week, and it took around a month an d a half before the ball softened at all, but the ball, once broken in, is unbelievable. THere is no better ball on the market. There's a reason that this thing costs 100, and that the best players in the world use it! But this is only for serious ballers..."
5,Finally the perfect dog food,"I am so happy to finally be done with trying to find a dog food that I feel good about feeding my dogs. I have a miniature schnauzer which of course has schnauzer bumps and a wire fox terrier that has bouts of excema especially in winter. This food has helped tremendously and they are so healthy and active. Everyone tells me I have such healthy looking dogs, shiny coats, sparkly eyes, and so peppy. I add some chicken of the sea canned wild salmon for extra skin protection and they are good to go!"
2,Still Kibble....,I have 6 large dogs and 2 are sensitive to kibble. Sure enough after 1 week of this kibble with their raw food they began to scratch. I realize all the ingredients looked great and are organic but our dogs still had issues with it. Just goes to show you that dogs are not kibbleavoires but fresh food omnivoires ;)You can't go wrong feeding a balanced species appropriate diet.
5,"Playa, Playa no more","Here we have another new author on the scene giving us a peek at the ""brother/friends"". It is so good to read about how men view their relationships and insight into their thoughts. In Baggae Check you get a glimpse at 3 brothers and their relationships, not only with each other, but with women.Larry, Mr Money, refuses to commit for fear of a women getting a hold of hsi money. But, does money mean so much when you can't be with the one you love?Greg, out in California tasting all the women. He meets one who takes him on a mystery date, and it changes his life. Julian, Mr Professor, has is own rules about children and relationships. Will he break them for the right woman?To find out the answers pick up this book, you won't be disappointed."
2,Unrealistic,"There were some major problems with this book. First of all, all the men didn't ""check their baggage"" until they got into a relationship. Curtis Bunn made it seem as if all a man needs to do is find a good woman and she will help him ""check his baggage"". This was unrealistic. A person needs to have all of their ""baggage checked"" BEFORE they go into a relationship. I also thought that Larry becoming saved and sanctified was too sudden. If Larry's new girlfriend was so saved and sanctified then why was she wearing daisy dukes when he met her at the grocery store? Also, why did the two of them spend the weekend together in the SAME hotel room and why did she have on a Victoria's Secret silk nightgown??? Real saved people would never do anything like that. Although there were two separate beds,they were still in same room and the temptation would have been to great to risk it. Better luck next time Curtis."
4,pretty,"nice bra, clips are a little too high and the pearl color is cream, not darker like it looked on my browser. Overall, pretty and comfortable"
5,nice addition to my dragon collection,"This book has awesome detailing. faux gems on the cover, faux dragon skin samples, lots of fold-outs."
3,Dragonology,"I was given this book when I was eight years old. It was really good since I like fantasy. But now, four years later, something changed that. My friend, who has an old copy of Lord of the Rings with the ring-runes on the edge, was able to translate those runes. How? She looked in her sister's Dragonology book. The language that it claims as ""Dragonish"" is really the language of Mordor! Outrageous. But of course, when I looked for myself, I couldn't see where they cited Lord of the Rings as a source. Then I looked at the language and there was only one difference: the g and f runes were flipped around. They were still the same runes, so they should have cited their sources. I call that plagiarism, what say you? I will also remind you that everything else about the book was good, and a friend, who also owns the book, and I were using it to help us write a book (and we will cite the sources)."
3,"Taken For What It Is, It's Good","What it is is a Children's dragon book, obviously influenced by ""Tolkien's"" Mythology. This book would be most entertaining to the tween-early teen market. Repetitive insert of the ""dragon dust"" cost this book another star. In the end it's a pleasant read that gives a nice overview of several breeds of dragons."
5,Scientific approach to mythic is magic.,"What a knockout! This book lavish and beautiful (and big) with inset (fake) gems and sparkly dragon scales and little fold out envelopes and notebooks and other treasures. It's like stumbling into the attic of a victorian-era dragon scientist. The scientific approach extends to cool taxonomies of different dragons and sections on hatching, care and feeding, habitat, and tips on taming a riding. This is class-A fun for any fantasy minded kid (of any age)."
5,Five stars isn't enough!,"This is so much more than a book, it's a beautiful and very unique work of art. A must have for any lover of dragons or mythical creatures, it would also appeal to anyone who just appreciates the unusual. I don't want to give away all the charming and magical treats that lie within, but I promise if you have any imagination at all, you will love browsing through this ""journal"" and sharing the findings of a serious student of dragons.You will believe!"
4,Dragonology - A beautiful book,"I got this book for a gift when I was 8 years old. I saw it at the bookstore and I thought the cover was pretty and it had neat stuff inside - dragon scales, dragon dust, and it had a big jewel on the back - by that I mean on the last page.I mostly looked at it for the first day, but then I started reading it. The stories were great. I still have it and have been collecting these books. I have Dragonology, Egyptology, Wizardology, and Fairyopia. I love these books and take good care of them."
4,Wonderful for the imagination,"I purchased this book for my 8 year old daughter... she is in love with it! Great for any child with an interest in mythical creatures. She loves the ""dragon dust"". Money well spent."
5,Terrific!,"My now-9-year-old daughter has ALWAYS been fascinated by dragons and dinosaurs; there has never been a time when she wasn't. Today was a Dragonology birthday. This book and it's companions (Dragonology Handbook, Dragonology game, toys, etc.) are an utter delight to children AND adults alike. It's amazingly real, and even has me wondering if Ernest Drake was a real man and lived in the 19th and 20th centuries. It's SO much fun for my daughter to actually be able to study dragons in an in-depth manner. But, I think Komodo Dragons will always have a special place in her heart. I highly recommend this book and its companions to any dragon-lover!"
4,Dragonology is fun,Gave this to my sis for her birthday. It is fun for an adult and a teen would also enjoy it. Good quality.
5,where is my dragon book??,i loaned it out three times... but the last time it didn't come back.... i guess i am not the only one who loved it!!!
5,Dragon Lover,"This book is already wearing out in my house. My son was 7 when he got the book for Christmas and is now 9 and still LOVES it! Interesting reading, pictures, notes, secret hidden items throughout whole book! GREAT JOB!!"
5,A wonderful book for the whole family,"My customers, children, and grandchildren, love this book, and all of the ologie books. With beautiful illustrations and great stories."
4,entertaining,"a fun read for those who believe in dragons and evenfor we who think it would have been cool if they were realif you enjoy this look for the video titled"" DRAGONS WORLD : a fantasy made real""I think it will be worth it."
5,Good book for kids,"No, I haven't read this book. My kid is significantly dyslexic, and is rarely excited about reading. This book excited her when she first saw it, and has kept her interested for a month now. In my unresearched opinion, that makes it a good book for kids."
5,Awesome!,"Just got this book for our 7 y/o son. He LOVES it. It's well written and consistent, and really has some cool additions, codes, and drawings. He has been bringing it to school everyday and is leading some dragon group with his friends."
5,Very Handy Little Cheese Slicer,"Fast delivery, high quality marble base, and includes extra cutting wires. I have used this many times since receiving it. It does a great job. I would recommend it to anyone who prefers to buy bulk cheese and slice their own."
3,Boatskipper,"This cheese slicer would be good for parties, since the base is heavy. However, the handle points slightly downward, making it awkward to slice completely throught the cheese, without hitting the table underneath."
3,Good product if you don't mind the broken wire!,"I've ordered two of these cheese slicers from the same company. Both times, the attached slicing wire was broken. Fortunately, two replacement wires were included. Since both of these slicers were given as gifts, however, it was quite embarrassing to have the recipients open a package that was damaged and had to be fixed from the onset. I'd suggest if you purchase this slicer, you open the box to inspect it before gift-wrapping in case the wire needs replaced. Aside from the wire issue, the product is solid, attractive, and durable."
3,Poor Quality,The wire on this slicer did not line up with the slot in the marble. I was going to send it back but it cost more to send it than I had orignally paid for it. So I ended up rebending the rod. I am not sure if the slot in the marble was cut incorrectly or if the rod was not bent right. Also the stud on the handle came out. I fixed it with some super glue. Amazon did arrange for about a 1/3 refund of the original cost for me as a credit on my Anazon store card. After remanifacturing the slicer it works great. I would not recomend this slicer for large blocks (2 lb and above) of cheese. Get a bigger sliger to cut these blocks. This slicer ships with 2 extra wires so there is no need to purchase addtional ones (as I did). Also hand wash this slicer. I purchased this one as a replacement for the same one that rusted in the dish washer and I could not take it apart to replace the wire.
2,Disappointed in Quality,"The slicer arrived rattling around in it's box with only one small piece of styrofoam for padding. The cutting wire was broken. The arm had come out of the marble board, and the handle was loose on the arm, as well. I was able to tighten the handle, but the arm doesn't stay in the board at all. Also, there are no directions for replacing the wired, and it definitely isn't intuitive. All in all, if it wouldn't cost me half of what I paid for it to ship it back, I'd return it."
4,Nice,"This is a very nice slicer. They include 3 extra wires in case you break one, which is nice, this is the only product like this that I found with that feature. Works great when slicing large amounts of cheese for parties and get togethers. Good item to have around or give at the holidays."
2,Don't bother,This thing has no precision. The handle is sloppy and loosens up. The metal bar is also sloppy and moves all over the place. I would say spend a little more money on something nicer.
2,Beware - Not as illustrated,I bought this because the illustration clearly showed it was a left-handed cheese slicer. It is not. The photo has been reversed. It is a right-handed cheese slicer. My two star rating is irrelevant. It does not reflect the performance of the product. It is a reflection of Amazon's error.
3,Not made with a great deal of precision.,"Out of the box, the wire would not line up with the groove in the marble. The reason is that when they form the steel rod that makes up the cutting arm, they do not bend it with any precision. After bending it into the shape it should be, the product works well."
1,dont buy from seller,product line came defective poor quality from China did not bother calling seller since it is a waste of time replacing not worth the time to replace. seller do not check the quality of thier product
2,Very Poor Packaging,When I received the Amazon box I could hear the box inside sliding around. Before even opening the box I already knew that the item would be broken just by the sound. The corner of the marble slab broke clear off and the main box had a hole in it from the foot of the marble slab. Very disappointed.
1,Defective item. Bad return policy.,Item arrived chipped. Could not just return it for replacement; had to send back for refund and reorder (from different source).
1,Don't even think about it!,"This item is of such poor quality that it can't even be put together. The threads on the handle and sleeve that holds the wire don't match and as a result I can't assemble the cutter. The sad part is, it will cost so much to return it that I'm just going to throw it away and buy one from a retail store if I can find a good one. Learn a lesson and spend your money somewhere where you can see the quality of the item before you buy. Amazon has let us down for the first time. I've always been happy with products in the past but this is junk."
4,I bought two,"I bought one for me, and one for my son-in-law who loves cheese! :) It's a pretty good product, especially for the price. A happy surprise was that they came with two extra cutting wires taped to the bottom of the marble cutting boards. :)"
2,Butchered!!,"There must be a better chronicle of the Woodstock festival than this CD. Many of the songs are severely edited. Santana's wonderful ""Soul Sacrifice"" is greatly shortened (you can get the full complete performance on the 30th anniversary CD of Santana's debut album), as well as Ten Years After's amazing performance of ""I'm Going Home"". ""I'm Going Home"" was MUCH longer than the version that's on this CD. They completely butchered a classic performance.I really can't recommend this CD, it could have been so much more. They could have at least included the complete songs without editing them so drastically. It would have been much better as a 2-disc set. I have to give them kudos for including Richie Havens and Canned Heat, though.If you want the best of Woodstock, then the 4-disc Woodstock box set would be your best bet."
3,the best is missing...,"Overall this is a good selection from the first Woodstock-Double-CD (or triple-LP), but it should be retitled:""Best of Woodstock, Sly Stone not included..."".So my advice is to buy the Double-CD, because Sly's performance (almost 15 minutes, so that is maybe the reason why it isn't included on this CD) is absolutely essential!"
1,Cut Rate Copy,"Great songs, lousy recording. Unfortunatly the entire CD is a flat, no-fi transfer. Editing could have been better to. 3 minutes of obnoxiuos crowd chant before ""Soul Sacrifice"" taints slightly one of the greatest songs in Rock and Roll history. Engineer dude must have fallen asleep while putting this CD together. Break out your old WS Lp if you still have it, you'd be better off."
3,The scary streets,"Fairly good advice given using LA and NY city as models. I can only speak for LA but alot of things he says about it now seem dated. If you've never been to either of those cities, he will make you afraid to go, but as a life long (50 years) resident of LA whose never had a problem, I have to take what he says about LA and NY too with a grain of salt. Then again, perhaps I've just been lucky. Come to think of it I did have a battery stolen out of my car at Venice Beach in 1985 not to mention the time I was robbed, raped, beaten, assaulted with a deadly weapon, and had a nuclear device go off under my car. But that was in Compton. Being a white guy I should have known better not to go there but I had heard about this dude with some really good crack and... LOL"
3,embarrassingly simply minded plot,"Until recently, I've very much enjoyed Joe Buff's books (and I've read them all). The near-future setting allowed him to explore some terrifying and fascinating ideas about limited nuclear warfare. However, his last two books have been based on plots that are increasingly hard to believe, even in fiction such as this. In particular, Seas of Crisis has a plot that is simply not believable. I'm not going to reveal anything to spoil the story here - obviously others have enjoyed this particular work - but if you're new to Joe Buff's novels, I recommend you start at the beginning and read his earliest, and best novels. Then, if you simply must have more, go ahead and read this - but you've been warned, the plot is as corny and improbable as they come.--- Update, December 2010 ----In re-reading my review, it is clear to me that it is too harsh, so I haveupgraded the rating by one star, and apologized to Mr. Buff (see comments)."
2,Ah no thanks,I was gald when this one was over. Took a chance on this one. That's why I don't play the lottery.
3,Amusing Timewasters,"Neither Up from the Depths nor Demon of Paradise are great but they were amusing (and progenitors of the Sy Fy Channel's usual fare of today); I wasn't looking for awesome so I wasn't disappointed. Up from the Depths must have been made before Piranha since it lacks the Corman touch for exploitation, and Demon of Paradise altogether missed the exploitative boat that Humanoids from the Deep virtually created. Not the best from Corman's vaults but fun to wile away the hours."
3,Creatures and chicken wings,"Everyone who loves roger corman will love this terrible creature double feature! Shout has been throwing a lot of his out recently and its a good thing too! I suggest mountain dew and wings for this party. This is what makes america great! Up from the depths and demon of paradise are by no means hollywood material but, they are not supposed to be are they? Remember, in case you do not already know, Roger Corman is the king of low budget crap! But, I actually have seen worse. Some were made in the early 2000s!"
1,Trash Films Dressed Up As B-Grade Ones,"After watching both of these films, I want that three hours of my life back.Now if you purchase this, You'll want your three hours back too.Talk about home movie horrors, I've had more thrills from watching Sigmund & The Sea Monsters than with these two lame ducks.They look like they were left over bits from other films that they just got some people off the street and made another two films from it.Don't believe me?Buy it then, you'll see and cringe and gasp in disbelief that films like this exist.Great cover though, just a pity about the so called movies."
1,Not worth it,"This book was a waste of money. It's meant for beginners that aren't familiar with the terms and concepts of stock trading in general. If you don't already know these terms or the basic concepts you shouldn't attempt to day trade. If you do know these terms and concepts, then this book is a waste. The day traders survival guide is a much better intro book and I highly recommend it over this one. Other recommended trading books to start you off are High Probability Trading by Marcel Link and Trading for a Living by Alexander Elder."
2,Here's the entire book in 5 sentences.,"1) If you have no money, don't invest.2) Don't invest money you can't afford to lose.3) You have to spend money to make money4) If you're poor don't even think of investing5) Thanks for buying my book now I'm richer.Thanks for the info Bentley."
4,Perceptive and hilarious,"Jennifer Allen can write. As is often the case with coaches' families, everything revolves around football and career. Her father was even more single-minded than most. Humor is of the sad-but-true variety; the first half of the book especially is hilarious. Hard to put it down. Her mother Etty is my new hero -- sees through it all, swears like a longshoreman, maintains her own eccentric identity throughout. There is another book here; I'd like to know what happened to Jennifer between high school and present; much is implied. Still, after all is said and done, the author's bio mentions two sons Deacon and Roman, presumably named after two of her father's great Rams players. She comes from quite a family; one brother a past governor of Virginia, another a Raiders executive. Well worth the time."
4,Not what I was expecting.,"As a lifelong football fan I was hoping that ""Fifth Quarter"" would include more about football than Allen puts into her memoir. However, the book is well-written and engaging. If you're looking for a book about George Allen, this isn't really the book to read. However, if you're looking for an interesting book detailing the childhood of a coach's daughter, ""Fifth Quarter"" might be the book for you."
4,Enjoyed the book,"It was a great book if your a Redskins fan from back in the day! We were great fans of the Redskins and George Allen so this is an interesting glimpse.Hell, my wife and I are still trying to get over his firing!"
2,SHOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED READING IN VIRGINIA,"I was particularly enlightened by her descriptions of her brother's, former Senator George Allen, violent, hostile, even sociopathic personality. These sections completely and utterly presaged George Allen's violence, hostility and ultimate meltdown on the campaign trail."
5,"This is Not the full version, only a sampling","This Igniter DVD is only a select sampling of the Full Flame film series. IT IS NOT THE FULL VERSION. It is only used to show scenes from the full version when deciding whether to purchase the master pack. However, the included short movies, ""Lost at Sea"" and ""The Matchless Message"" makes this sampling worth buying. both will make you think about what the Christian's mission truly is.The full version `Full Flame' Series by Reinhard Bonnke is incredible! The images are beautiful and masterfully put together for visual impact...a truly inspiring visual experience, and has a powerful soul stirring influence. The Full series consists of 4 DVDs for a total of 8 films. Powerful...wonderful...inspiring..."
5,Great To Use,I just received my new WI-FI finder. I have version 1.1 and it DOES have a light in it and it works great. I just plugged it into a USB 2.0 port and Windows searched for the drivers and found them online and I did not even read the book or use the CD! It works great and charges thru the USB port. Highly Recommended-by the way I got it thru New Egg which was the cheapest shown using Amazon as a starting point.
1,not quite fit.,did not help in overcoming the interference between the wireless camera system and the wireless network.
1,Humbug Rabbit,Humbug Witch was such a delight; this book is not nearly as clever or captivating. Story line is too complex.
1,Couldn't Last Thru Delivery,"Ordered these speakers to replace the OEMs in my 300. FIRST order arrived damaged. Housing for mid/tweets were broke off. sent back and re-ordered same speakers from different seller. THOSE ARRIVED DAMAGED TOO!!! Same thing, mid/tweet housing detached (broken). Can't tell you how they sound 'cause they didn't make it thru the delivery. I don't beleive in coincidence so either came from factory broken, or broke during delivery. Either way definitely not sturdy enough for me."
4,It's a little flimsy,"Like I said, it's a little flimsy, and you will absolutely need to get the outside brackets to go with it. I did not and had to purchase some L brackets to brace it from moving side to side. I would recommend it for anyone looking to build their own swingset, but absolutely purchase the other brackets too."
4,A good introduction to bookbinding,"After watching this dvd, I felt I could bind my first book. Resources for materials would be helpful. Also, a good deal of airtime is given to advertising other titles in the series."
2,Not what I had hoped.,"Though I did get a couple of good ideas from this DVD, it is barely worth the $15 price tag. Shortcuts and glaring mistakes that can be spotted by someone as green as myself just don't belong in a so-called instructional video. These ""experts"" are a little short on expertise."
4,Very Detail oriented,"This review applies to the series (Army Group North, Center, South)These books are good in their own way, but are not for everyone.First, the scope of the book is large, but it describes happenings on the length of the sector of the front through the division and battalion level. This is quite interesting as you feel you are following individual units in movement.For those who are unfamiliar with the broader narrative of the battles of the eastern front in which the detail of this book takes place, you might want to read a more holistic book, like David Glantz's When Titans Clashed, which is probably the Eastern Front bible.The beauty of these books is in their status and divisional and battalion reports, which convey the daily carnage of the eastern front."
4,A good look at the Eastern Front,"Army Group Center is a useful reference for the force it describes. I must note that due to wide line spacing it contains a bit less content than its 356 page length would indicate. However, it does comprehensively describe the operations of German armies, corps, divisions, and occasionally regiments and lower, throughout the war. Soviet fronts and armies are also covered, but not as thoroughly, and the political/strategic elements that influenced operations are included in a balanced fashion. There are several appendixes (untranslated from the German) which provide useful organizational data, but no index."
3,A good overview,"""AG North"" follows the same pattern as ""AG Center"" and ""AG South"" from the same author. It's a good overview of the German military operations in the ""northern"" part of the front from 22 June 1941 to May 1945. In any case, don't expect to found the complete history of the Heeresgruppe Nord ! Finnish front is, logically, absent.One important difference with ""AG South"" is that ""AG North"" isn't firstly a mere compilation of divisional histories or others authors books.""AG North"" also address topics as the Final Solution - but only of a quick overview of the Einsatzgruppen mass shooting -, Baltic states occupation and partisan warfare.Logically, the book focuses on military operations, even giving some data about the ""other side of the hill"", a good point for a German book of 1966 ! A chapter covers sea operations.Even if ""AG North"" is a classical ""Eastern-front-through-german-eyes"" book, silent about the criminal behaviour of the German army, it could find a place in a WW2 library.H.H."
1,Editorial Vomit,"Nothing even rseembling fact is to be found in this book, but I suppose that lends itself to a certain type of person. A work of fiction pretending to be science. Science is based on facts, observation, experimentation... not delusional ""Because I said so"" statements. ""Professing to be wise, they became fools"". Romans 1:22. Young-earth creationists would do themselves good to remember that one."
1,Science fiction start to finish.,"This book presents as fact that humans and dinosaurs lived on the earth at the same time, that g-d placed all animals on the earth at the same time, and that scientist are all a bunch of crackpots trying to defame Christianity.If you want to believe that the earth doesn't rotate 1 Chronicles 16:30 or that bats are birds Leviticus 11:19, please go right ahead and use the Bible as a science textbook. There is no need to produce evidence that scientist are wrong when you have faith."
4,This book is a hilarious parody piece,"Paul S. Taylor's latest parody of Creationism takes the satire to a whole new level. Gone is the pretense of accuracy or an ""unbiased"" look at the facts. The latest book is now peppered with absurd claims like the T-Rex being an herbivore, or the brontosaurus being a passenger on Noah's ark.The Colbert style denial of the scientific process is not a new routine for Taylor, but his successive books have gotten more and more outrageous in the ludicrous attacks launched at science. Be sure to check out this latest entry in his multi-volume laugh fest and it's spot on parody of ignorant extremism."
3,Hilarious!,"I highly recommend this for people are interested in crank culture and also for parents who would like to show their children the extent to which people can be gullible when they devote themselves to one particular religious veiwpoint. I would give it 5 stars, but for the fact that there are a high number of Americans who don't see the humor of it, and who foist it upon their children as if it were science, instead of their own zealous religious view refracted."
1,This is awful,This book is very dangerous. Children will be mislead by it. I cannot believe that some people do not understand that the Great Flood is a STORY. It is a myth that was used for teaching. It is not fact or documentary. This book throws science out the window and replaces it with fiction.Be very choosy about books. Don't buy this one.
1,Science and religion don't play well together,"I am embarrased to admit that I own this book. A book about dinosaurs should not have anything about religion in it, unless you believe that dinosaurs had a religion. Science is the meandering search for truth; religion is about accepting an established version of the truth. If you are interested in the genealogy of dinosaurs I recommend the BBC ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" followed by the BBC ""Walking with Prehistoric Beasts""."
1,Unbelievably ignorant dross,"This book is a fine example of the rank ignorance that masquerades as ""creation science."" Taylor's dinosaur references are riddled with inaccuracies and occasional outright lies. The religious aspect is no better: Taylor's simplistic literalist interpretation of familiar biblical stories reveals, at best, a Sunday-School level of understanding of the Bible. In short, the book is perfect for those who like their religion spoon-fed to them in comforting, easily digestible bite-size chunks. Thinking Christians and non-Christians, however, should leave this book on the shelf."
5,Great Book about Dinosaurs,Many years ago I was given this book for Science class in a Christian School. I used this in teaching on Dinosaurs. It was an excellent book. I learned much along with the Children. I now have a 3 yr. old Grandson now and he is so interested in dinosaurs. This book was given to him at Christmas. I bought it here at Amazon. My Grandson is still a little young but I want him to learn the Biblical account about Dinosaurs. I recommend this book for those who are homeschooling and for Christian Schools and for all who desire to know the truth of God's word about Dinosaurs.
1,An Grand Embarrassment,"Neither Christian, nor scientific. This childish gibberish is neither theologically sound, nor scientifically accurate. What does that leave us with? ... Propaganda."
4,Interesting & alternative views to scientific theories.,"This kid's book presents alternative (and yes, biblically-based) theories on dinosaurs, the timing of their existence on earth, and their extinction. I probably got more out of reading this book than my 7 year old grandson did."
4,Prince Ali!,"The Genie costume looks just like it does in the profile picture.Pros:Very comfortable. The bottom feels like sweatpants, the top feels like it's made out of pillows.It does not make you warm, as the costume is surprisingly light weight.The mask is not made out of cheap plastic, and is much more comfortable than your average mask.Cons:The mask strap broke within hours. It's easy enough to glue back together, but the life span was entirely too short.There are no gloves. Although they aren't pictured, it would have completed the ensemble."
4,a wiccan herbal,a good introduction to wiccan herbalism with some interesting references and recipes for use.
5,very good,"The success of their first album, Purple comes second in the line of great songs that rocks on this album.I will not say that core is better becouse its a grunge album and purple is not.Vasoline is the best song on the album with its quick and hard rythm of deans deleo guitar playing and on this album he really knows how to play guitar,also eric kretz and robert deleo contributes with their talents to make this album a joy to listen to.Interstate love song,big empty(from the""the crow"" soundtrack).Army ants,kitchen Ware and Candy Bars and many more contributes to make this an excellent album to listen to.Try it outYou wont be dissapointed.9/10"
5,I LOVE STP,"This cd is by far one of the best you can own. I traded my ""Tiny Music"" cd for ""Purple"". Although I'm still undecided on which one is better, I really do love this cd. Like most STP, it has a variety of sounds and lyrics. Everyone should buy it right now, cause it's damn good."
3,BBBBBOOOORRRRIIIIINNNNNNGGGGGGG!,"This album put me to sleep! No.4 is so much better! Next time I want to buy an album, I'll listen to it before I buy it, because I want my money back!"
2,HOW DOES STP MEASURE UP AGAINST THE OTHER ARTISTS OF THEIR TIME?,"In terms of IMPACT, INFLUENCE and IMPORTANCE to the 1990s as compared to classic rock bands (though not musically similiar) this is how STP and the other artists of the 1990s stack up against 60s/70s band_________________________________________________________The equivalent of 90's artists to classic rock artistsPearl Jam = Led ZeppelinSoundgarden = Black SabbathRadiohead = Pink FloydAlice in Chains = the Doorsthe Smashing Pumpkins = the Beach BoysTool = The Velvet UndergroundNirvana = the Jimi Hendrix experience (in terms of impact, yea, although the guitar playing was obviously much different)And even though the White Stripes came later, the White Stripes would = the WhoAnd STP?Stone Temple Pilots = The Monkeesone star band. two star album. If you can skip the Monkees while searching for great 60's music, you can skip STP while searching for great 90's music."
4,Excellent Album,I really enjoyed listening to this album of STP. Purple shows how diverse STP really was with hard songs like meatplow alternative songs like Interstate Love Song and ballads like Pretty Penny. STP to me does not sound like grunge-- alternative rock maybe but with a much harder side Alternative-Hard Rock or Alt.-Metal fits with them better in my opinion. Silvergun Superman is clearly the hardest song on the album and features Scott Weiland playing guitar.... Because the album is so diverse I believe it is great but I still think Core is a little better.
5,Musical Nirvana?,"Great music from a great band.Unfortunatly a lot of the music from the Grunge era was over shadowed by Nirvana (of course Nirvana were an awesome band). This is one of those bands that had critics arguing over if they were Grunge or not.""Intersate love song"" and ""Vasoline"" are my fav tracks.After the 3rd listen I couldn't believe how good this album is.A million times better than this ""New Metal"" (lame a-- Metal) junk coming out today.I'll go on living in my Grunge time warp thank you.Now where did I put my Flannel shirts???"
3,three and a half stars,"Much, much better than their debut. In ""purple"" they develop their own style, and shed the copycat label given to them by so many critics. The songs themselves are some of the best that they have written. ""Vasoline"", ""Interstate Love Song"", and ""Big Empty"" are incredible. However, the harder songs fail to impress much. They're ok, not bad, but not very good either. ""Meat Plow"", ""Lounge Fly"", and ""silvergun superman"" have very little to offer. They don't have great riffs, good solos, or energy. Now, this is a good album, and I don't want to scare you away. It's definitely worth the money, and you get quite a few lovely tunes. However, ""Tiny Music"" and ""No.4"" are much better, despite their lack of radio friendly singles."
4,Worthy Sophomore Recording,"Despite the criticism this group faced by being told that they were ripping off the major bands from Seattle, they continued to stand strong with this follow-up. Some of the best-known songs on here are the rockin' ""Vasoline"", the light rock of ""Interstate Love Song"" & the pseudo-ballad ""Big Empty"" which was also a part of the soundtrack for the movie, The Crow. One other noteworthy song is the acoustic ""Pretty Penny."" These songs are good, the CD is pretty decent over all."
4,Interstate love songs.,"Stone Temple Pilots remind me of bands like Primus and The Cranberries, in the way that each bands debut was excellent, then each following album was weaker and weaker. Therefore I find ""Purple"" to be their second best album. Though not quite as hardcore as ""Core"", it's still rooted in grunge more than the following albums were, and the songs are still mostly strong front to back. ""Meatplow"" is a good opener, which leads to ""Vasoline"", one of their catchiest tracks ever. ""Interstate Love Song"" is another classic, and afterwards is ""Still Remains"", which I have always loved. Then there's the simple ""Pretty Penny"", and ""Big Empty"", also found on ""The Crow"" soundtrack. Everything else is still great, right down to the hidden track, which really does sound like Johnny Mathis."
1,GRUNGE STINK CLONE-A-RAMA,GRUNGE...FLANNEL...ALL VOCALIST SOUNDING LIKE EDDIE VEDDER WET THE BEDDER...PUNK INFLUENCED... LACK OF MUSICIANSHIP...LACK OF ORIGINALITY... GLAD THIS GARBAGE HAS FADED AWAY...WISH RAP AND COUNTRY WOULD DO THE SAME... FOR VEDDER LOVERS AND PEBOZOS EVERYWHERE!!!! WOW!!!!
5,Another classic,"This is the second album for the trippy 90's hard rock group. While STP was unfairly lumped in with the grunge-rockers of the era, STP was in reality a hard rock band, sounding straight out of say, 1975. All that with some grunge influnces, of course. This album includes some of the band's biggest hits, like 'Interstate Love Song', 'Big Empty', and 'Vasoline'. While not being as hard-drivingly heavy as the previous album, the band have not gone light. I love all of the songs on here. Scott's voice, I feel has matured a little bit, espescially on tracks like 'Big Empty', which gives a new meaning to the term 'power ballad'. Buy this album, it's a tried and true classic."
3,Solid album.,"STP creates some good alternative rock music. This album has a few hits, but ""Core"" is a much better album. Please, do yourself a favor and sample it before you buy it!!!"
5,D*MN!,"Let me put it this way:90s ""Alt-Grunge Rock"" doesn't get much better than this.It's a sure winner if you like any of these bands:Alice-In-ChainsSmashing PumpkinsNirvanaPearl JamMudhoneyThen again if you like those bands you probably know who STP is, and have this album......oh well."
4,good album,"I love the video for ""Vasoline"", its so weird and cool! The song is just as cool. Interstate Love Song is another stand-out.David Rehakauthor of ""A Young Girl's Crimes"""
4,Great Groove.,"I think the magic of STP is their ability to truly groove. The play between the drums and the bass, with moderate tempos creates good solid groove and drive.Better then average, in a class of average rock.This album or the first one, ""Core"" will suffice. Of the two, go with ""Purple""."
5,Excellent CD!!!,One of my all time favorites....I think CORE is better though. I love every single songs in it. I highly recommend this CD.
5,Enough time has offically passed. The dust is settled. And this is a classic album.,"It's good to see decent ""modern"" rock albums like this one are still getting some play. Nobody cares about Haddaway or The Real McCoy anymore, but all the decent rock albums from the era are still being discovered again and again.This is one of the essentials. Get it."
4,it's good listenin',"Each STP album sounds a little different than the other, yet somehow they all sound the same. Interesting. Anyway, ""Purple"" is a fine album. Songs like ""Meatplow"", ""Lounge Fly"", and ""Unglued"" are awesome, and they keep that hard rock feeling essential to their first album. Other songs, such as ""Interstate Love Song"", and ""Big Empty""(one of their best)are great and are very straight-forward tunes, and some of the most memorable of the 90's, and ""Pretty Penny"" displays a little classic rock in it, possibly a little CSN? As for the other songs, they are also good, and the album is very eclectic. Also, the secret song is pretty funny: I think it's called ""12 Gracious Melodies"", but it's from some other artist, I don't know, now I'm just getting confusing oh, well. Buy the album anyway, it's worth it. Later."
3,Underrated singer,"The three stars are because I find some of the songs skip-worthy, and to do something about the general grade inflation that's a problem in many of the reviews posted on Amazon. BUT, ``Interstate Love Song'' is worth the price alone. Just simple, dreamy beauty."
5,Early masters of the motion picture,"Illuminating and informative book about the birth of the motion picture. Written by a Frenchman it concentrates on the development of the motion picture in France but other countries are not ignored. This is an interesting and original account of the founding fathers of the motion picture(and founding mothers too, a section is devoted to the worlds first woman filmaker Alice Guy, whos first film was The Cabbage Fairy.) Beautiful colored photographs and an engaging,lively text make this a must have novel for film and history buffs."
3,Won't keep their attention very long,"Got this for my then 7 year old daughter for Christmas because she saw them on TV and of course went crazy over them. She opened them and played with them for what I think was an hour or two before moving on FOR GOOD!They spin manually, meaning you have to move the stands by hand to make the dolls spin - not battery operated like the Barbie princess one.Also, the dolls fall of the stand easily unless they are tightly positioned. I had to position the dolls in order for them to stay for any length of time. When my daughter positioned them they fell after a couple of twirls.If your daughter really likes the movie, I would say just get the dolls instead and not these spinners since my daughter just ended up playing with the dolls afterward."
1,Brass Construction? I must have forgot,"This album has 3 hits. Movin, Changin, L-O-V-E you. The rest is fluff. Im sorry I bought it."
1,Do NOT purchase this item!!!,"Please save yourself the trouble and do NOT purchase this item!!! It is NOT wood. It is cheap and does not look anything like the picture provided. The 'carving' is fake looking and the finish continually chips off. I was beyond disappointed when I opened the packing and saw that the table looked like a child made it.To make matters worse, when I contacted the company to return this monstrosity, they refused to take it back!!! I couldn't believe it!! I pushed them harder and ultimately, I was told that this had to be brought to the 'supervisor'. The rep took my name, two phone numbers, and email and assured me that I would be hearing from someone shortly. Well, I still have not heard anything back and it's been six months!If I could have given it zero stars, I would have! Horrible!"
2,You get what you pay for,"This is a very inexpensive combination, but you get what you pay for.I really bought it for the tripod, so I can't complain too much, and the tripod itself is moderate... Could be sturdier.The bag, however, is WAY too small, and only has two pockets to place things."
5,Great Grill/Griddle,I have been using my Grill/Griddle regularly since it was purchased and I am very pleased with it's performance. I really like the temperature control unlike using my foreman grill. It is great for grilling everything with ample room. It's fits in my Kitchen Aid dishwasher but it is so easy to clean that it usually doesnt get to the dishwasher. I shopped all the brands before buying and found this one to be the most convenient and versatile.
5,Very good and useful product,I keep this item within reach of my kitchen. It is used at least 3-4 times a week and is very easy to use. it is also very easy to clean up and we are very pleased with the purchase price too. Would recommend this item to our family and friends.
3,NOT SO GREAT,"SORRY BUT I DIDN'T FIND THIS GRILL QUITE SO GREAT. I AM NOTICING THAT IT HEATS VERY UNEVENLY WHEN COOKING AT LOWER TEMPERATURES LESS THAN 300 DEG. THE END OPPOSITE THE HEAT CONTROLLER IS GETTING MUCH WARMER, ESPECIALLY NOTICEABLE WHEN COOKING BACON WHICH COOKS MUCH FASTER ON THE FAR END. AT HIGHER TEMPATURE SETTINGS, IT SEEMS TO BE SOME BETTER FOR COOKING PANCAKES, FRENCH TOAST OR GRILLED SANDWITCHES. OTHER THAN THAT PROBLEM, IT SEEMS TO BE A WELL DESIGNED GRILL AS IT IS SPACIOUS AND I LIKE THE DRIP PAN UNDERNEITH. IT'S EASY TO CLEAN THE ENTIRE UNIT."
1,Wolfang Puck's appliances,"I am very upset with Wolfang Puck appliances. I bought in HSN a grill and I received a letter from Wolfang's Company saying that I should return the power cord with the label because it had electricity malfunction and it was dangerous, with the promise I was going to receive a check for the total amount of my purchase in 4 to 6 weeks. I sent it two months ago and I haven't receive any money back. I also bought Wolfang's 1.6 HP power blender in HSN and stop working after 5 months. Wolfang Puck's products are pure garbage. I would not recomend wolfang's appliances."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this product. The main problem I had was that it smoked up my entire house when I cooked bacon. I removed the bacon, and the smoke was so bad, I had to open all the doors and windows so it wouldn't set the fire alarm off. I was using the temp listed in the manual for bacon. I lowered the temp and the smoke still occurred.One of the reasons I bought this griddle/grill was because it was dishwasher safe as I hate washing dishes. I was very disappointed when I discovered that it was to long to fit in the dishwasher and I had to wash it by hand.It is ok for making some things such as grilled cheese sandwiches, but the overall hassle/annoyance factor isn't worth it. I have used my griddle 2 times now, and I am ready to get rid of it. I can get the same results with a good frying pan and the clean up is a LOT easier."
5,A must for your Kitchen,"I love this product. This is the second one I have purchased. I had to repurchased another one, because I used my other one so much. This is agreat product and I would recommend it to all. I love all of wolfgang products!!!!"
3,The Host,"In the sewers of Newark, New Jersey people have gotten killed or servily injured. Somethings living in the sewer that's not human or is it just human error that killed and injured these men? FBI Agent Mulder belives that this is no human error, that somethings down there in the sewer pipes bellow his feet. And when his partner, Scully finds something in the body of a dead sewer worker he just maybe be, right."
3,This book is not nearly as good as Empathy,I loved empathy and so I went on to read this. I was disappointed because it was about a monster and i was more interested in the phenoemnon (I don't think I spelled this word correctly) and such. A good book to read if you have nothing to do. But empathy is a better buy in my opinion.
3,great pocket candy,"These have pretty good flavor which doesn't disappear after the first minute. They are stickier than Charms sour balls or Lifesavers, but they are each individually wrapped so they don't stick to each other and half a roll doesn't grab all your pocket lint."
3,The best was yet to come,"I acquired the 3 non-EP offerings in reverse order from the way they were recorded. This was sort of like eating dessert first! "" Evening Visits"" has several strong songs but doesn't go front door to back door, strong from pillar to post like the other two. But, I had to get it as the other offerings had me believing in the imposible. 3 great songs but the others are sort of like struggling to find themselves in sound and in lyric. I say start with ""Drift"" or ""Farewells"""
4,fun videos of real animals,"My 22 month-old really enjoys all the video of the zoo animals. There are many close-up shots and a large variety of animals. This video is mostly shots of the animals with some overlay of the Baby Genius cartoon characters- not the quick switching back and forth between real and cartoon images of the Favorite Songs video- a quality that I think improves this video.The songs however are not quite enjoyable or memorable- only one has stuck in my head. They consist of verses about the animals set to popular children's tunes- not bad, but not astoundingly great. The worth of this video is in the videos of the animals. If your child, like mine, is in love with all animals I would recommend this DVD."
4,good blades,work ok but not as sharp as I thought they would be. I will probably stick with the #11 blades.
2,Not so funny,"I guess I was looking for more ""Laugh In"" humor. This required a lot of thought, and unfortunately when I watch humor, I don't want to work this hard."
2,Maybe its just me...,"I bought this tape out of respect to Lily Tomlin as a brilliant comic and an accomplished performer. But my frame of reference for her is apparently colored by her Ernestine the Operator act, which cut substantial new ground in its time. This tape's performance may well be a maturing of Lily in content and style, but I had a hard time following it. I found its lines to be unsnappy, disconnected and unmemorable. I believe we are all indebted to Lily Tomlin, not just for entertainment, but for pushing the progressive social agenda. It's just that this tape is relatively expensive, so reflect on your own frame of reference before buying it."
1,Less than Lily,"This is a stage production, apparently written for Lily. It is not funny, it is not well acted. I threw it away after one viewing.R. Dean"
4,Reality is nothing but a collective hunch....,"It's amazing how Lily can hop between characters with complete ease. Trudy the bag lady dispenses amazing insights while wearing her wig inside-out. Two hookers (Brandy and Tina, both played by Lily) have a touching conversation with each other, end up meeting up with Trudy, and pass by Agnes Angst - a teen punk rocker at odds with the world. The video vignettes give meaning and life to Lily's amazingly developed characters and their activities. She must be in good shape because she never gets out of breath as Chrissy - a participant in an aerobics class who gives a non-stop monologue as she exercises.It does get a bit long - but it's worth it. Very funny. Impressive. No wonder this was such an incredibly successful stage production."
4,She's the best!,"It's a little far out, but that is to be expected when it comes to Lily Tomlin! This was made years ago, so not everyone might like it, but if you love Lily, you'll love this."
3,Lily Tomlin,"Lily is such a Talent, but I think this program lost a lot by being on video instead of in person."
5,Should be number ONE!!!,"Greazy meal is above and beyond any band, in the Twin Cities, in all catergories. Visualize World Greaze is their premiere and most creative CD. Highly recommended, eclectic funky Grooves."
4,The 1st Pop Princess.,"Debbie Gibson's Greatest Hits album is a pure guilty pleasure. I was a huge Debbie fan when I was a little girl. Something about her voice and songs just spoke to my six-year-old heart. Songs like Foolish Beat, Only In My Dreams, Lost In Your Eyes, and Electric Youth are sugary and sweet. Debbie was pretty much a child prodigy, she wrote and produced all her music, not bad for a seventeen year old! The song No More Rhyme is probably the most gorgeous track on this collection, stunning! Get this CD for the memories, the '80s rocked!"
4,cool music,"this is a cool cd. i love debbie gibson since she is muchj better than britainy spears and she is real, not fake music like other groups that sing."
3,A lotta great bubblegum,"Enormously talented, and yet wide-eyed and girlish, Debbie Gibson was a bit one-note, but always heartfelt and mostly utterly romantic. ""Lost In Your Eyes"" is one of the best puppy love anthems of all time. I didn't care for the samey remixes. Why not add something rare, like the flipside to the ""Anything is Possible"" single(""So Close To Forever"", one of the very finest breakup songs, written by Gibson and sung with a shivering crack in her voice)? Ahhh well, only in my dreams..."
4,Where are the best songs?,"I like all these songs, I really do, but my favorite hit songs by her have always been, ""I Think We're Alone Now"", ""Heaven Is A Place On Earth"" and ""It Must Have Been Love"" and none of them seem to be on her. But otherwise it's a great cd."
2,very average,"her music was mainly forgettable as with the song-writing.but I give her 2 for being a writer,vocalist&Musician she played Keyboards.but the songs are Dated and only worked when they came out.her voice is still good now."
4,80's music was/still is cool...,"i love debbie gibson. her stuff sounds dated now, but so does alot of 80's music. doesn't stop me from liking it, though.this album reminds me of sophmore year in college, going to dorm parties, saturday night football games and buying a new tape/cd every payday. she still has more talent than most teens who are performing today. i was very glad she had some success."
1,Vague information...,"The Haynes family of repair manuals are VERY limited in their scope of information. They try to cover too many variations of a car in one book. The Taurus early 4 cyl, 3.0L and 3.8L, all of which are very different engines, are all lumped together in this book. Many times it is very difficult to obtain specifics on an engine. An example is, they may mention the 3.0L and not he 3.8L which leaves you many times guessing about the location of a sensor or a wire harness. The significant downfall of this book is when they don't explain HOW to do something! They will often times just say ""remove"" part with out mentioning how. Again, this is just because they try to cover too many engine types in one book."
2,Dead on or complete miss,"The book claims to cover '86-'95 model year Taurus/Sables, but if you own a 1995 Model like me, the pictures of the '86 or '87 Taurus they show in the book won't really help you much. Among others, If you have any engine OTHER than the 3.0 V6, You won't get much useful information. For me this was a strong point with this book, some of the coverage is lacking, but overall, it will get you through at the end of the day and back up an running. I wish this book had better wiring diagrams, and finally, pictures of a more current Taurus would be a real plus."
1,Dosen't Apply To The Cars In It's Title!,"I bought this book to help me work on my 95 Taurus. But the 95 has many differences from the other years. In most instances, the book dosen't explain this. In one of the repairs I was doing on the brakes, the book gave 2 sets of instructions: One for models through 89 and then One for 90-94. Totally ignoring 95 which is very different! They need to rewrite this book, and possibly split it into more than one book."
2,"Impractical, poor schematics, no photos, procedures unclear","Simple repair and maintenance procedures are described in such a way that they look complicated. True, special terminology is unavoidable in such a technical book, but in many cases they could have used plain English. Adding photos (there are none in the book) would be very helpful."
1,not enough info,What you want to know as a mechanic refers you to a mechanic..Am not pleased with this book
2,Some of the information is incomplete or missing.,I found the three letter trouble codes to incomplete and inacurrate. I had to buy the Ford shop manual and the information in the Chilton's isn't even close.
2,All I wanted to know is how to adjust the headlight beam.,"I dished out the money for the book. The first thing I wanted to find out is how to adjust the headlight beam on my '93 Sable wagon. Maybe I missed it but I can't find anything in the book that says how to do this. Otherwise the book may be useful, but I feel as though I've been ripped off."
3,Mercury Sable repair manual,Book is useful and in reasonably good condition. Shipped and sent on time as well. A good buy.
1,Does not fit the A610,"I have the A610 and recently broke the factory provided belt clip. Unfortunately the phone is already considered obsolete and is no longer supported.I was pleased to find the belt clip on Amazon and the price was reasonable. Unfortuately the clip did not fit the my A610, so I was forced to send it back. I'm not sure what it is really supposed to fit, but it isn't the A610."
1,Not tough enough,"Got these boots for my birthday after shopping the internet for them. All reviews were great, and Red Wing Shoes has been around a long time. I figured the quality would be there, but it wasn't. The first month I had them the leather split on the side near the toe and the sole started to separate from the shoe. Maybe I just got a bunk pair. K-mart's Safe Trax cost less than half as much and lasts twice as long. It's that bad. This was my first and last pair of Red Wing Shoes."
5,Red Wing Boot,"I have owned many pairs of red wings boots over the years and they are the best built and longest lasting boot or shoe I have ever owned, worn and used. This is compared with a wide selection of other brands of boots and shoes."
4,workboots,"The boots are perfect for the work I'm doing at this time Lightweigh,Flexable and I really like the zipper on the side."
3,You have to be VERY motivated to do it,"My mother bought me this video from a garage sale. I'm only 16 and always full of energy and I had to FORCE myself to try this video. It's very dancey and you don't feel it in certain areas as you do with Denise's other videos. You just feel tired and unsatisfied in the end. I wouldn't recommend it.I do give it 3 stars though because despite how bad it is, Denise stil maintains her perky-ness. She's great if you're working out alone."
5,Lost 2 jean sizes in 3 weeks!,I have been out of shape since the birth of my 5th child 5 years ago. I FINALLY pulled out this tape and after 18 days of using this tape 6 days a week. I have lost 2 jeans sizes already! I haven't been this thin or firm in YEARS. It was hard to get started but it is getting much easier and I get a GREAT all over workout. I've gone from not making through it all to making it through the entire workout at FULL capacity. I look forward to loosing ALL my extra weight and even wearing a swimsuit this summer.
2,Do the FLOOR or THE STEP! Make up your mind!,"If you can ever get by Denise Austin's phony pitches, you might get through this discombobulated step workout! I would sure love to give her an ACTING class, and I don't even act. No matter how many times a week you do this, you will remain confused! It's step on the floor, strut, sway, back, step, etc. etc.Ssteps are not easy to follow; no consistency, quick moving changes, etc. I prefer a consistent workout with few changes. I don't need to prance around like a goony just to jazz it up. Give me consistency! She also offers a toning up and stretch utilizing the step as a bench. If you really want good step workout, try Kathy Smith Step workouts......MzRizz"
2,Not Happy With It!,"I have been working out at home with videos since the birth of my sons. I have a large variety of home exercise videos; I have worked out with Denise Austin on television and enjoyed her, however, I found this video very difficult to follow. She continuously varies her patterns without notice. It is a good workout but too complicated. I appreciate it when the routines are laid out systematically; I prefer the Buns of Steel series and Kathy Smith. These videos are explicit in their instruction and are easier to follow making it a lot more fun."
3,"Good, except for the knob / screw on the bottom...","My only gripe about this setup is the screw / knob that protrudes out of the bottom of the quick release plate - it makes storage (or setting the camera on a flat surface) awkward. The whole point, IMHO, of the QR plate is to be able to leave it on the camera, and this design makes it impractical."
2,Not a Recommended Versions of Sibelius Symphonies,"Simply: i dont like this versions. i bought this dvd in part because there are not many dvds performing Sibelius symphonies and because i like to view the concerts of bernstein in dvd. older bernstelin's recordings whit the new york philharmonic are better than this ones. these dvds are just a rare videos. bernstein cant get in toch with the spirit of sibelius. i think in part due to the orchestra not very familiar whit the marvelous finnish composer. if you are interestes in Sibelius buy the KARAJAN recordings, very far the better of all."
1,boooring......,"This book is so boring that I had to put it down and away after having read one third of it - what a waste of time and money (I actually bought it)!The droning on and on about the different white trash characters that have no bearing on the plot whatsoever except for the nice try to create some local color is unbearable. I don't see these people or the dull landscape (or if it's not dull, then I don't see that either), nothing. There is no pace in this plot, no intensity, no dynamics. Yet another ""best-selling book"" proclaimed to be best-selling by someone who apparently has not read it."
4,"Solid central character, solid mystery debut","""A Field of Darkness"" is a satisfying, moody mystery that mostly plays fair with its dispensing of clues to readers. I liked the way our heroine, Madeline Dare, came from money but is now living a more-or-less middle-class existence with her blue-collar husband. That means she spends half her time looking down at the ""trailer trash"" surroundings of her Syracuse, New York neighborhood and the other half feeling guilty about how her family poisoned the environment and exploited the region's labor pool to make its millions. I like complicated characters like that. Good supporting characters and a couple of skillfully prepared surprises round out this enjoyable debut novel."
2,Her second book is better,"I read this book after having read her second novel, ""Crazy School."" I thought Crazy School was a great book, so I had high expectations for her first novel. This book was ok, but it wasn't as interesting as ""Crazy School."""
4,"Not an immediate fan, once into it couldn't wait to keep reading.","I was not immediately impressed with this book. I bought it mainly because I used to live just outside Syracuse and thought it might be interesting from that perspective. It was slow starting and did not immediately grab me and pull me in. However I kept going, and was really glad I did. I felt it was well worth the money I spent and am looking forward to her next book. I would recommend it to others who like mysteries, but also like a well written story. Keep up the good work Cornelia!!"
3,The second half of the book was far better than the first.,"I bought this book because of the stellar reviews. But I came very close to putting it down fifty pages into it. It seemed like nothing was happening but the main character waxing philosophical about every little thing. There were too many characters, all with crazy names, and I had a hard time keeping track of who was who. At first, Madeline really got on my nerves. I thought she was whiny and selfish and didn't care for her at all. Plus, I wanted her to shut up with all her observations and just move the plot along. Then, the plot did start to move and the second half of the book was good enough that it made me glad I didn't abandon it."
2,Hooray for Libraries,"Really, this book would have hit the wall if I had paid good money for it. As I slogged through it I kept feeling I had read this plot before, met the main character before. I do admit that I learned a lot of esoteric facts, and as I was IMing someone about the Yiddish and complaining about the book, I was asked why I was still reading. I read until the end cause the author of my favorite sociopath, Jack Reacher, cheered for the book. I read the glowing reviews and I shake my head. Take heed of the critics, their points are so valid.I am deliberately harsh as there are too many good books out there and life is too short to give any of your time to this one. The stars are for the trivia picked up but the same can be learned from crossword puzzles."
2,Yawn,"No surprises in this oh-so-predictable thriller. If you don't guess who the murderer is by the time you have read a third of the story, then either this in the first mystery you have ever read or you have a severe head cold and have taken medicine that makes you drowsy.I have no idea how the author (who includes a long boring section all about herself at the end of the book) got such good reviews."
3,A very Clever Book,"An amusing first novel. Her dialogue is clever and brimming with the vernacular. She could use more experience in character development, with her predictable and cliched' ""bad guys"". The plot is stereotypical, but a fun read."
2,A field of nothingness,"I read this book for my book club. Out of nine women, only one really liked the book. No one hated it but it really did nothing to grab the reader. Way to many reference which distracted the flow of the story and hence the reader."
4,"""WASP Noir""","Madeline is thrust into a cold-case investigation when dog tags left at the scene of a grisly murder years before have a family member's name on them. Overall I liked it; plenty of twists, smooth pacing, cultural references, and engaging characters. I had to warm to the author's descriptive style - at first it seemed over-done, like she was cramming stuff in but within a few pages that feeling vanished. It isn't as good as say, Gillian Flynn or Tana French, but it is still an engaging read."
2,Gratuitously violent and too taken with one's own cleverness.,"I'm with the review by Eileen Duncan on this one. While the author did occasionally show some flair for writing witty sentences and funny descriptive phrases, I found all of the characters unbelievable and unsympathetic, and their motivations completely unconvincing. The real teller of how self-consciously congratulatory this book is appears at the back, where the edition I read actually had readers' group's discussion questions included! REALLY? For something as shallow and frivolous as this debut novel, soaked in blood and gruesomeness? And of course, all this horrible stuff happens to her while her husband is away and unreachable (hence the placing of the action in the pre-cell phone days!), and no one thinks to have the heroine go stay with someone to keep her safe? Or to accompany her when she places herself in ridiculously dangerous situations for no reason? Self-indulgent, indeed."
4,last pages will SHOCK you,At first I struggled with this book .....having some trouble keeping details straight but I pursued and am I glad I did. Read this book. Stay with it. Don't dare look at ending. Enjoy
3,Good until the end,"I'm a big Anita Shreve fan, and enjoyed this book until the last page. The ending left me feeling frustrated, cheated, and a little confused. I had to read it several times to make sure I was reading it right. Not the way I like to feel after an otherwise enjoyable read."
1,One for the recycling bin,There was a build up to the suicide in the last paragraph? Where? Was it buried somewhere in the verbose chapters telling of Linda's attitude towards hotels? Was it typed somewhere in those irritating italics?When I finish a book I usually donate it to a thrift shop. I simply can't donate this book. I would hate to think that someone else wasted a few hours of their life by reading it. I tossed it in the recycling bin instead.Horrible book. Don't waste your time.
1,The Last Time I Will Read Anita Shreve,"Self absorbed, poignant, pretentious, plenty of Catholic angst, details that move boringly slow, nuance in the mundane - not at all my kind of book. Linda is a woman who seems to have given up on life when she hit middle age, who orders food over and over again to not eat it. She meets a former lover at a literary convention, and maybe things will pick up? [Hint: don't count on it.] In hindsight, the italicized speech and italicized thoughts make a little more sense - but were annoying and rather affected. And, yes, the ending is a very contemptible, condescending trick and renders the book insignificant."
2,What a disappointment!,"I am an avid Anita Shreve fan but unlike the other reviewers of The Last Time They Met, I was very disappointed in her latest effort. I actually enjoyed the book (although less so than many of her other novels) until I got to the end. The ending, though, was so contrived and so gimmicky, it ruined the book for me. It insults the reader's intelligence. Plus, is "":A Novel"" really necessary?"
1,I am so confused!!,"I greatly enjoyed reading The Pilot's Wife, Sea Glass, Where or When, Eden Close, and the Weight of Water. How was I to know that Shreve could put out such a confusing, impossible and unrealistic novel? I've reread the end several times and am trying to put a timeline together of what I've just read and it's not possible.If you're good at figuring out a Rubik's Cube, this is a novel for you. Otherwise, stick with the others I mentioned before!"
1,Blah with an explosion,"I will sum this book up for you so that you don't have to mess around with reading it.""blah, blah blah""some more""blah, blah, blah""We aren't done yet- still some more...""Blah, blah, blah.""BAM! (Bomb goes off...)and now none of the ""blah, blah, blah"" makes any sense at all."
3,LAST PARAGRAPH RUINED BOOK!,"I really enjoyed this book until the last paragraph. Sure, it's not great literature, but I still had a few hours invested in the damn book. I want those hours back."
2,Don't understand ending,"I've read several of the author's books and all are suspenseful, sometimes draggingly slow. Sometimes you can't undersand the plot due to the long sentences with strange constructions. The love story is such that you feel the ache of the characters. But why the ending? Nowhere does it explain this. It doesn't fit the story at all. And you wait until the last paragraph to get it. Is a sad book and you never really feel happiness. Drags you down."
1,"Please, Anita, you can do better than this!","While Anita Shreve's prose is always haunting and lyrical, her use of a manipulative plot device leaves one not breathless, but infuriated. I have been a fan of Shreve's for years, and when she is good, no one does it better. This book, however, is a huge disappointment. Perhaps she is being rushed to press. Perhaps she simply underestimates her audience. Whatever the reason, this reader was both and annoyed and irritated with Ms. Shreve for so hackneyed and trite an ending!"
3,Two novels in one? A mixed review,"I started off liking this book with the two main characters meeting after a long time apart. I was engrossed in this first story (the present) and was disappointed with the focus on the back story, especially in the second half of the novel. The descriptions of Africa are wonderful and the back love story is also compelling. I just felt the two story lines (Africa/love story) and present day did not blend together in this book. I felt I knew more about the underlying emotions and motivations of the past then the present. This was disappointing as I wanted to also find out more about their present lives and feelings. On the other hand, the past does need to be understood to unravel present day actions. I have read other Shreve novels and like this one the least of all."
2,Seen it before...,"*****SPOILERS******I'm surprised that nobody's compared this one to ""Atonement."" Maybe it's only because I read this one a mere month after I finished ""Atonement,"" but boy talk about deja vu. I even checked to see the copyright years on both books - 2001.I thought the story moved very slowly, and I too, as mentioned in other reviews, had little sympathy for Thomas. I didn't like his character very much at all. The teenage romance hardly seemed as deep and long-lasting as the beginning of the book described. And I saw the ""uncle"" story coming a mile away. Of course, I didn't predict the ending, but then I just read nearly the exact same ending in ""Atonement"" so I was hardly astonished."
2,The Last Time They Met,"I have been a fan of Shreve, until this book. The ending of the story is an insult to the reader. After reaching the end, I felt as if I read the story in vain, I felt the whole story, up to the chapter titled Seventeen, utterly worthless reading."
4,The Last Time They Met,"WARNING: if you plan to read this book DO NOT read my letter: it reveals the ending. I just finished the book last night and I am embarrassed to say that even though I consider myself a perceptive and intelligent person, I still do not know what really happened! I only post this review so that, hopefully, someone will tell me! Did Linda die in the crash and Thomas make up the entire rest of their relationship or did Thomas commit suicide and Linda made up the ""the last time they met"" in a fantasy that she creates while at the book fair? I do know that in parts one and two the dialogue is italicized rather than in quotation marks (as was noted by a previous reviewer who seemed to know what that should mean) but does that mean that it is ""created"" dialogue as opposed to ""real"" dialogue? Or, vice-versa?I hope that someone responds to this, soon, as I am going nuts! Thanks!"
3,I loved/hated this book...,"A beautiful story idea, I will admit. The writing, although slow at times, was not dull or boring to me. The ending, definitely a surprise. What I hated about the book was simply the fact that the surprise ending made the entire love story meaningless. I love the idea of two people so connected, they can't help but cross paths. But the ending as is turns the story from a romantic tale to the fantasy of an guilt-stricken alcoholic. Had the ending been different (I was expecting it to return to the future and drawing some sort of meaningful conclusion) I would have loved it through and through, but as is, I remain disappointed."
2,What a waste of time.....,"I'm half way through the book and can't read it any more. I kept plugging away hoping that it would get better but it hasn't and now I give up. I loved ""The Pilot's Wife and Fortune's Rocks. This was nothing like either of those!!!"
4,Loved This Book,"What a great read! This is definately a ""take me away"" experience. Anite Shreve wove beautiful threads of detail through this touching story. It certainly doesn't disappoint!"
3,"Enjoyable, but haunting!","I thought this book was well written. It displayed wonderful emotion and scenery. I knew a shocking ending was in store, but was not prepared for what it turned out to be! It threw me off and I re-read the first section to try and make sense of it, but am still left somewhat confused. I can't say why without giving away the ending, but I will say to prepare to be jolted!"
2,"Lovely plot, very slow","I purchased this month several months ago. I was enticed by the back and front covers. The story of a couple meeting after many years sounded wonderful. Unfortunately, after forcing myself to read it for two months and only getting a third of the way through the book, I had to put it back on my shelf. Perhaps I will pick it up again, but not for awhile"
2,Shreve's dishonesty unfairly tricks the reader,"I too have liked several of Anita Shreve's novels. I actually liked this novel until the ending. I don't want to give it away, but it seems to me unfair to have the 312 pages that have gone before completely overturned by the final page. Writers should not set out to deceive readers unfairly. Yes, Thomas and Linda have a beautiful relationship, and Shreve writes with evocative images, a taut plot (even if a few too many coincidences), and terrific scenes--especially in Kenya. But the ending undermines all that has gone before. A huge disappointment."
2,Dallas Revisited,"Remember the season of the old TV show Dallas that turned out to be just a dream? Remember how it seemed like a total cop out? Well, that's a good comparison to the ending of this book. I've read most of her other books and enjoyed all, except for Fortunes Rocks. Her latest has an engrossing story, though the timeline is confusing, and the dialogue a bit stilted. I stuck with it and felt she was back on track with this one. But then that ending! Why?"
2,a little dim in comparison to its glowing reviews,"i picked this book up hoping for a whirlwind romance novel and when i read all the reviews on the first few pages that gushed about the beauty of the book, i felt excited to read it. unfortunately, i was let down.the book had its good moments, certainly. the characters are passionate and could have been interesting if the story wasn't SO slow and difficult to get in to. i had trouble finishing the book, to be honest. i don't think i will be reading any more anita shreve books."
4,The Ending Gets you!!!,"~Tells a beautiful story about two eccentric individuals who have known each other at pivotal times in their lives and have a special bond readers ultimately come to see at the end. A true love story about all of the ""what ifs"" the roads of life can take us through. Great read, but not for those who don't enjoy authors using an eloquent, almost poetic style!"
5,Polly McCrillis,"The ending came as a surprise, a sad surprise, for in the literary romance world, endings must end happily. Ms. Shreve does not follow the rules, and for that I am grateful. Her novels have their own persona, word choice, either in dialogue or narrative, suiting the time period, and her settings are characters unto themselves. I feel I've been given a magnificent gift when I read her works and know they will not disappoint, even when the ending is not the anticipated, hoped for, happy one. Bravo, to Ms. Shreve for having the temerity to not follow the rules. As a writer, I thank her for the inspiration her writing fosters.Almost TakenFlight of Faith"
2,Sort of blah.,"I started off liking this book, then started to wonder if the meetings between the lovers were going to be part of a larger plot, or was it just an episodic way of telling a story. Turns out to be the latter. SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING!!! ahead--> I didn't really like the ending, for the reason that, if a person is going to imagine a whole life for herself, why wouldn't it be a happy one? I needed that to be shown, not just taken for granted. Was the author trying to say that the girl's background prevented her from imagining happiness, even at the moment of death? There was nothing really said about it, but it was the major plot device. So I found it unsatisfying, and the writing kind of mediocre."
3,Isn't it great the power Shreve has through her characters??,"A friend asked me to read the book and explain it to her. I read without asking what confused her, and got caught up in the characters' lives. Although there are A LOT of hints-- use of italics rather than quotation marks, etc.--the surprise at the end knocked the wind out of me! I was disappointed, mostly because it seemed a little too clever and perhaps trite to end both Linda and Thomas' lives in such an abrupt manner. I guess it seemed a little manipulative too, although a great way to illustrate the tragedy of Linda's life cut short and Thomas'life without his one love. Maybe Shreve is reminding us that these aren't people, just characters; they exist only on the pages she has given us, the same way Linda continued to exist for Thomas after her untimely death. The Last Time They Met is as Shreve herself put it, ""the enduring struggle to capture in words the infinite possibilities of a life not lived."""
1,Hated this book,"As soon as I read the last page of this book....I was angry. I LOVED Pilots wife, so I decided to buy this book. I found it slow moving...the only time the book finally picked up for me was when I got to where Thomas and Linda met. Then it started moving along. The end of the book was for me a disappointment. Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb. If I hadn't turned down the corners of some of the pages....I would try to return this and get my money back. I will NEVER read one of her books again."
4,The last time they met,I really enjoyed this book it met you in suspense til the very end you thought you knew 're ending
2,JFGABCIK,"Well....it could have been worse. The author could have started out by having Thomas bed down Linda on the cafeteria table at the assisted living home.Describing teen-age hormonal issues can work. Describing teenage hormonal issues in adults doesn't work for very long, and when it's the central focus of the story, it soon gets tiring. The surprise on the last page of the book is like a practical joke that shouldn't have been played in the first place, a joke where we're all supposed to exclaim ""Oh, how clever!"" whereas I, for one, just let out a groan.This is the fourth Anita Shreve book I've read, and the first I haven't enjoyed. She writes extremely well; her descriptions both people and places are excellent. She doesn't need to stretch with a plot like this to make her writing sing."
2,Disappointed,"I love Anita Shreve's novels, but I have to say that this one, to me, was a confusing mess. The book is written 'backwards' chronologically, then at the end, I'm left asking ""WHAT?!"" I was disappointed with this one, but am still a Shreve fan."
3,3.5 stars,"This book was written in a different way than other books I've read. It was kind of backwards. It starts out with Linda and Thomas meeting again at age 52, after not seeing each other for many years.After reading this section I spoiled it for myself by reading the last page.Then the next section they are 26, and each married to someone else. Then at the end they are 17 and you read about the accident and the surprise ending.If you read Weight of Water and have a good memory (I do not), then the end will not surprise you. In fact you should see it coming (I didn't remember).I'm giving it only 3.4 stars because if felt a bit like a cheap trick."
2,I'm done with Anita Shreve,"What a disappointment! Although Anita Shreve is a terrific writer, she has gotten lazy! The book echoes ""Atonement,"" another recent book with a cop-out ending. It is so disheartening to spend time on a book and then have the story be negated by the ending. I think Shreve, in her new found popularity, feels she has to produce a book a year. In so doing, she is not willing to spend time on an honest conclusion. She ought to take off a few years and think about her work."
2,Utter Dishonesty,"I agree with Ms. Hoover who says ""I feel ripped off"".The end of this book came out of nowhere (or perhaps out of too many viewings of The Sixth Sense) and negates all that came before.What was the point of the ""finely crafted story"" if it's all not even real?I give it two stars just because she at least gave poor Linda some joy, before wiping her out but it's interesting how many of the people who say they liked it didn't actually even get the details right.One reader said she liked Thomas's wife Jean from the first book ""Weight of Water"" but hated her in this sequel but Jean isn't even in this book. She is merely mentioned in passing... ""she is somewhere in Australia"".His wife in this book --who surely everyone hates-- is Regina, not Jean.Any one who can actually follow this story will be not just disappointed by it's ending but disgusted by it's artifice and completely uncalled for dishonesty."
4,Wow!,"I must admit that as I read this book, I kept wondering why I had chosen it. It is completely unlike anything I would normally read and very, very hard to get into. I felt like I was reading a sweet, reminiscing romance novel without any twists or turns and had I not been encouraged by a good friend, I definately would have put this book down after the first 50 pages. The ending was a relieving shock and I felt rewarded for my perserverance in wading through the incredibly boring storyline. I did enjoy the backward concept but it led to confusion and several chapter re-reads. I am still reeling from the end and looking forward to another Anita Shreve novel."
1,What a horrible let down,"ms shreve is a brilliant writer. i fear this travisty of her talent was conceived and executed as a course in creative writing 101 wherever she is teaching. so sadly disappointing.the ending was in fact a total cop out and a quick reread doesn't justify this cheezy conclusion...please, do a better job next time. unconvincing clap-trap and way beneath you. off goes my copy to half.com..hope it sells.. i'd planned to keep it on my shelf next to all my other shreve novels..but ...sadly, it 'ain't a keeper'"
1,Expected more from a writer of Shreve's caliber,"There are two things that I usually don't do when reviewing books.1. I never review ""big names"" because they are usually well covered by eager reviewers and don't need my meagre offerings.2. I never copy other people's comments - that's just lazy.However, today I am compelled to do both because I was so peeved with this book and D.King's review was just so succinct. I attach it below:-I will sum this book up for you so that you don't have to mess around with reading it.""blah, blah blah""some more""blah, blah, blah""We aren't done yet- still some more...""Blah, blah, blah.""BAM! (Bomb goes off...)and now none of the ""blah, blah, blah"" makes any sense at all.Had to reread the last page a couple of times to make sure I really understood what had happened because I could not believe a writer of Shreve's caliber would actually try and swing a whole novel on such a premise. Really disappointed."
2,Glad it's finally over...,"I really had a rough go on this one! For me this book just dragged on and on... I never thought I was going be done with it. I guess I don't care much for the present to past story lines and this is how this one was written. I've read some of her other books and loved Where or When, I could hardly put that one down."
3,i'm confused...,"First off, I really enjoyed reading this book. I loved the fact that 'fate' or something, kept causing these two people to continue to find each other at different points in their lives. Everything was extremely vivid and the attention to detail was great. Then I reached the end of the book and the last two paragraphs just confused the heck out of me. I don't want to ruin the story for anyone that hasn't read this book yet. It's definitely a worth while book, I just got confused...still am confused."
5,Last Page,"I've never read a book where it was so necessary to read all the way to the last page to understand the whole novel! For anyone who hasn't read it but intends to, don't read the end until you really get to it (my suggestion). Pretty interesting. I recommend it."
1,Ending is a child's trick,"Shreve isn't the first to employ the backwards telling of a love story, despite the reviewers who call this ""unique."" It isn't. It's a ripoff of Harold Pinter's technique in ""Betrayal,"" also the story of an obsessive affair, and was also used by Martin Amis in his novel about the Holocaust.Shreve is a good writer but her books ALWAYS have disappointing endings; in ""The Pilot's Wife"" it's a sappy and unconvincing romance; in ""Fortune's Rock's"" it's a convenient and unconvincing pregnancy. But this one is just ridiculous, it's nothing more than a cheap, childish trick.This is my last Shreve novel. I keep giving her a chance to live up to her own promise, and she never does. Feh. Into the dustbin with this, and never again!"
3,Surprise Ending,"I am an avid reader and a huge fan of Anita Shreve, but I have to say that I was a bit disappointed in this book. I didn't read any of the reviews before picking up this copy, and I'm glad that I didn't because the last page is such a surprise, I had to read it three times just for it to sink in. I won't give any of the details away, but what I will say is that Shreve weaves a tremendously well-written tale, only to let readers down at the end by such a shocking pronouncement, that I'm still having a hard time wrapping my head around."
4,"A slow start, but a strong finish!","I had a difficult time with the beginning of the book, but thanks to long airport lines and two delayed flights, I am glad I hung in there until the end. For anyone who doesn't believe that true love still exists, read this book renew your faith!Quite a story, and a great storyteller."
1,Pam Ewing's Dream Season All Over Again!!,"Do you remember the show Dallas? They killed off one of the main characters (Bobby) at the end of a season. The next year the show received horrible ratings. So on the 1st show of the following season, you are told that last season's episodes were all a dream...Bobby is still alive! And there you have 'The Last Time They Met.' I love surprise, twist endings...such as Edith Wharton's in Roman Fever - one of the best endings EVER!! But this ending makes you think,""why did I even waste my time forcing my way through such a poorly written book?"" When you are done reading you can't help but think..this was a complete sham and a waste of my time and effort. This is a book that seems to have been demanded by the publishers in order to follow up the popularity of The Pilots Wife. A definite waste of time!! I have made a point to tell people NOT to read it."
1,Cheap Trick,"The title of my review says it all, as far as I'm concerned. Totally unbelievable. You just do NOT do that to your readers. I went back and leafed through the book again to see if it worked, and it didn't. A real stretch.I give it one star because there was some fine writing in the Africa section. Otherwise, if I'd not been on a Philippine island on vacation with little else to read, I might not have finished. And I felt cheated when I had."
2,Cheap Ending,"I was able to finish this book, which rates it at least 2 stars, but I was sorry I did, because the ending is cheap. The ending essentially says, all events you read about and thought were evocative, thoughtful, sad, or whatever, were simply the imaginings of a secondary character. Why bother? If it was all Thomas's imagination, don't you think he would imagine something a little happier? It becomes the story of a sick and obsessed mind, rather than a poignant story of love lost. I had read Pilot's Wife and enjoyed it, but I don't think I'll be reading another of hers."
1,Last Time We Met,I have never been so disappointed or angry as I was when I read this book. The ending is very upseting. I don't understand why the book was written to end like it did. I felt totally let down and a waste of precious hours of my time.
4,Speechless,"Wow. I finished this book late last night and was left speechless. I also had an awful night's sleep....hmmm....any connection?I agree with one reviewer who said the ending may leave some shattered -- I felt wrecked and, for awhile, highly confused. But I do get it, I'm just disappointed. Not in Shreve, or in the book, but because I was truly wrapped up in the characters by the end of the book, in a way I wasn't in the beginning or even the middle. By the end I loved them both and couldn't wait to hear how they would end up (I assumed the book would bring me back to present day). Not so, and the revelation on the last page saddened me SO."
3,Borrow from the library,"I am very glad that this was a library book for me, and not a purchase. I would have been furious. Yes, the writing is lush and beautiful, as I have enjoyed with Anita Shreve's earlier work. And YES, the ending was unfair. What was the point?"
1,Horrible,I found this book to be absolutely horrible. I enjoyed Sea Glass and the Pilot's Wife and cannot believe that the same author wrote this garbage. I recommend saving your money by not buying this book.
1,Run That By Me Again,"Having read a few of Shreve's earlier works I expected more from this book. I was disappointed in ""Fortune's Rock"" but really disliked the ending of this book. Since this was suppose to be a continuation of an earlier book the ending made me feel like I wasted my time twice. I had to re-read the end three or four times because I didn't think my understanding of it was correct. It made a mockery of the intensity and complexity of thier love story and was insulting to the reader. I just picked up ""Sea Glass"". If Ms. Shreve doesn't redeem herself here I won't be reading anymore of her books."
2,ambivalent,"I guess I hated it more than I loved it, although parts of it were interesting and the ending was intriquing. I can't decide if it was worth plodding through all the slow parts, boring love letters, and characters I can't identify with because I identify with the loyal spouse at home being cheated (physically or emotionally) on by a self-absorbed Thomas. Since I can't decide, it deserves only 2 stars. I had to search online to try to see if I understood the ending. The backward story-telling was confusing, but makes sense in light of the ending. Overall, I don't think this book is worth the effort. I still hope to find other books as good as The Pilot's Wife."
2,Still thinking about it.,"I was ""SHOCKED"" to say the least after reading the last page of the book. I reread it about 5 times to see if I read it properly, and to make sure I was understanding the words. I felt like I was reading the last page in a foreign language that I wasn't too confident in. I thought that maybe I wasn't comprehending the ending because it was so unbelievable. I couldn't believe that Thomas could make up all these events in his life. As the other readers mentioned some of the story was told in Linda's narrative. Thomas really had some imagination. I thought the first half of the book was TOO slow and the writing style was excruciatingly descriptive. I had to put down the book and then pick it up the next day hoping it would get better. The second half of the book did get a little better until the end of the book. I thought the love story between Linda and Thomas was beautiful (if it really had happened). But to happen just Thomas' imagination - now that's just scary."
