3,Not for early trainers,"I got this video to be seen by my 2 and 3 yr. old. It is definitely not for a little trainer since it has a section that states about being a big kid where you do not do this or that anymore. Some of the items hold true for a two yr. old, but several of the items do not. This video is enjoyed by my three yr. old, but too old for the two yr. old."
5,Buy it!,"My 3-1/2 year old was very adamant about not using the potty. She absolutely refused despite several attempts over the course of a year. We tried books (for her and us), rewards, etc. Nothing worked. When we bought the movie, my daughter loved it and asked to watch it over and over again. She brought her potty into the living room to sit on while she watched the movie. After about a week of watching the movie, we gave her Pull-ups (she was afraid to wear underwear at first) and she's been potty trained ever since with only a few accidents in the beginning. I would strongly recommend this movie for anyone having difficulty potty training an older child. It's ten dollars for the movie. If it doesn't work, it's only ten dollars and if it does, it's invaluable. I'm glad someone came up with this idea or else I'd still be changing my toddler's diapers."
5,Amazingly Effective,"My 3 year old son was very resistent to potty training. I purchased this dvd based on Amazon reviews, and boy, were they right. By combining the dvd with a reward system/chart for each 5 b.m.'s, he has become almost completely potty trained in two weeks. I had tried rewards only, but to no avail. There is something in this dvd that really catches children's interest. It covers all the basics, and he loves the songs. I let him watch it as many times as he wanted, and it was just the catalyst he needed. I am so grateful!!"
5,my two boys love this DVD,I know others said this was mainly geared toward girls but my two boys love it. One is 2 and the other is 4. They especially enjoy the jester in the pricess story. There is also a song about hand washing that has really helped out with getting the boys to wash their hands. The music is cute for kids. My oldest tells me he has Potty power!
5,Why didn't I just start here in the first place,"I'm not sure if starting with the video would've changed all the drama over the last 6 months, okay year, regarding potty training. I think it just settled a confused little mind trying hard to understand. It had little ""big"" kids, it had music, it was empowering and it defined what being a big kid vs. a baby meant. But yes, I give it rave reviews and kinda wish I would've started there instead of ended there. It's been here a few weeks now. Maybe a month. Within days, she was handling her business. When there were accidents, we'd pop in the video, she'd get empowered and unconfused again and there'd be a longer period of no accidents. She now requests in public for me to take her to the nearest restroom. I have not changed a diaper in two weeks.Potty Power officially achieved. On occasion, she proudly screams out ""Potty Power!"" when she's feeling a little extra confident. So cute. And so resolved."
1,Daughter hated it..so did I..,"I ordered two potty video's for my daughter. This one and ""It's potty time"". My daughter watched ""It's Potty Time"" with great interest. I put on Potty Power and she was completely disinterested. I tried to get her to watch it a few other times but she just kept asking for ""the purple one"" which is the color of the DVD of ""it's Potty Time"".In addition, I felt potty power with it's song about things to do while one the toilet taught dawdling, and the wiping section showed kids pulling and pulling on the toilet paper...great way to teach them to empty a roll.Mine's going on ebay."
4,good DVD,"our 2 year old loves the potty movie! we're still working on the potty training, but this is a great intro to talking about it and getting ready! it's not terribly annoying-- actually cute songs- I even caught myself humming them at work one day :\"
4,Potty Power,"My granddaughter thinks the video is great! She wants to watch it over and over again. When she started watching it, she immediately went to her potty and wanted to start practicing. Since she gets to see other children about her age sitting on their potty, she is getting more secure with the idea."
5,Our kids love it!,"We have 2 year old twins, a boy and a girl. This is their favorite video. If they could, they would watch it a zillion times a day. I limit it to once a day, though. I think that's as much ""Potty Power"" as I can take at one time!I disagree with some of the other reviewers here. I think that the jester steals the show. He is a wonderful actor, and I never get tired of watching his shenanigans. The singer/narrator is wonderful too. She speaks to kids on their own level, never talking down to them, and has a lovely voice. The kids in the video are all adorable, and I enjoy watching them too, especially ""Princess Jill."" Lovely little girl.I think some of the kids' ""Potty Power"" is rubbing off on me!"
2,It was just OK,I'm not a fan of this video. My daughter who is almost 2 only made it through the first few minutes and then she was over it. She likes movies most of the time so I thought this video would be a good idea for her. I was wrong. The video was kinda creep when it came to the fairy tale part at the end....What a waste of money.
3,Worth a try,This is a pretty good video - gives nice instruction on how to use the potty and seems motivating however it did not work for my son. He enjoys watching the video along with his other dvd's but it did not cause him to suddenly start using the potty. I would recommend trying it though if you are having difficulties potty training your toddler - I had a similar video when my daughter was a toddler (now she is a preteen) and it helped to motivate her so what doesn't work for some may work for others.
5,Lots of music,"If your child likes music, then this is the DVD for you! My daughter got bored with the Elmo potty DVD because it was mostly talking. The songs are wonderful and the acting is not too bad either. :)"
3,Amazon Products,"Overall I loved your products..Some of items are not very great,,Slim Engine Samsung LEDTV fantastic it getting too old now but still performing very well.."
4,"Catchy tunes and a ""big kid vs. baby"" game that may get the ball rolling","My toddlers liked watching this video quite a bit. Don't expect it to perform miracles on your un-pottytrained children or most likely you'll be disappointed. It is a good help for the kids to see someone else, other than Mom and Pop, talk about the subject and the things related, e.g., not needing diapers anymore because of one's age, washing hands, what to do while waiting on the potty.There is a big kid versus baby segment. It's really short, but it gave me ideas that I use on my children to get them to do ""big kid"" things like use the potty, eat with utensils instead of their hands, put on clothes themselves, etc.My children wanted to emulate the kids in the video (a good thing in this case). On the negative side, the production values are a bit cheesy. But for kids, it's fine."
3,"Worked for my niece, but boring for my daughter","I thought this movie would do the trick. It seems great, but my daughter was NOT interested."
4,The baby likes it a bit,"My daughter seems to like it and it's ok until the lady starts singing and then my daughter gets up and walks away. She did get the message though and has attempted the past few days (it took nearly a full month for the video to get here after I ordered so kiddo is catching on quick) to use her potty even making it to it twice, the bad thing is that she doesn't want to wear a diaper or pull up at all because ""princesses"" wear panties like in this video, starting out potty training is hit or miss so it's like having a puppy in the house, lol.I give it 4 stars because we don't like the way the lady speaks and Bella doesn't like the singing. We've also been watching ""once upon a potty"" which is the video that helped me train my other two children when they were little and my daughter likes that song better."
5,Potty Magic!,"Our 2-year-old daughter was showing no interest in the potty until we got this video. We also have the Elmo potty DVD (who normally she loves!), but even Elmo couldn't hold her attention. She isn't potty-trained yet (we haven't really been pushing it), but she's definitely on her way!"
2,Not worth the money,"Even though this item isnt that expensive, it is totally not worth the money. First the video seems to be only good for kids 3 over. So if your kid is 3 or over and still not potty trainned, then it is a good video, yet annoying and not that fun. My son is 2 he watched for two seconds and was not interested at all and he loves watching videos. It is not that easy for little toddlers to understand and get what they need from the video. There are better potty trainning movies out there."
1,not so hot,This is not a really high quality production. Looks like it was shot by a company that maybe also does wedding videos. My 18 month old son walked away from it and brought me a Sesame Street dvd to put on. I'm hoping the Elmo Potty training video that should be out soon is more entertaining for him. I really couldn't watch this one more than once.
3,Potty Power,"It has catchy tunes and my daughter likes it a lot. I didn't like the ""Jester"" character in their play, it is really creepy these days that an adult male (other than the father) is dancing with a three year old girl after she learns how to use the potty. This character should be eliminated, maybe they should have used a fairy ""potty"" godmother instead of this guy that isn't funny at all."
2,Creepy Jester needs to go,"DVD has two big flaws: telling toddlers that may still be in a crib that only babies sleep in cribs (I'm quite happy my 2 1/2 yr old is still in a crib and so is she) and the CREEPY JESTER. The part at the end where it says, ""he asked the princess when they were finally alone why she finally went on the potty"" is just wrong. Plus, his horrible singing and joking for the parents is useless for kids and annoying for adults. Who on earth thought this creepy hack should be in a kid's DVD?"
2,This DVD would not work if your child is still small,"This DVD will only work if you child is at the age where he/she wants to be a big kid. Since my child is only 2 and still thinks that she is a baby, it didn't do anything to her. I would not recommend this if you want to train your child while he/she is still small."
2,do not recommend,"It's only a half hour long, and it's really amatuerish looking. My 2 year olds couldn't even sit through one viewing."
4,Entertaining - but effective? We'll see!,"My 2 yr 7 mo daughter really loves this CD. She sings to it, dances to it, and even asks me to join in (which, believe or not, I do). She even joins in singing with the chorus ""No more diapers for me!"". The problem is ... she is still in diapers. She shows no interest in her potty other than simply sitting on it between songs. I understand that parental encouragement is part of toilet training as well (I am not relying solely on the CD), but it seems that kids are either ready for toilet training ... or not. I will certainly give it more time - at least she enjoys this."
3,neutral,I have a 2 and a half year old son and this video does not hold his attention. The video is more geared towards the parent on how to assist with potty training. I purchased a cartoon video which my son perfer to watch.
4,This helped so much!!,"This worked great to motivate my two year old to potty train. Both of my young toddlers are fully potty trained. The girl in the video sings different songs about using the potty, how to wash hands, and how to wipe from front to back. Toddlers sing and sit on the potty to set an example. However, there is a part at the end of the video that I really can't stand. A goofy man is dressed as a king's jester. He sings an annoying song in a high pitched voice. I always skipped the end. Other than that, it's a good tool to assist with training."
2,"No title menu and unskippable, creepy commercial","This is apparently the 2009 edition. I had no idea there was a difference until I got the DVD. The first time I put it in my Xbox, it locked the Xbox up, which has never happened before. After resetting the Xbox, I got it to play the DVD. Any attempt at getting to a menu gives me a blank gray screen. I then have to play the DVD from the beginning. Skipping chapters is also disabled. This wouldn't be so bad if there wasn't a really creepy commercial/trailer for some solar system video they made. At the end of the Potty Power video, it continues with a FAQ for Parents. They should remove the commercial, add a title menu, and put the parent FAQ in as a bonus feature or something."
4,Songs that stick in your head....,"My almost 2 1/2 year old son LOVES this DVD. We have been watching it for several months, off and on. I'm not PUSHING potty training - YET! The music really sticks in your head (I find myself singing ""No more diapers for me"" quite often). As my son watches Jessica and the children, you can see him mouthing some of the words and songs - although he hasn't come right out and started singing. He does like shouting the ""Potty Power"" motto - and after watching, he does have more interest in the bathroom. I really like this video and encourage other parents to purchase it. It's a lot of fun while addressing some sensative issues for toddlers."
5,This video worked for us!,"Our daughter is now going potty thanks to Potty Power. She loves the video and asks to watch it everyday. Since receiving this video she sat on the potty a lot more than usual (she has a baby sister which had slowed things down) Now she is going to the potty all the time. She takes the potty to the ""big"" potty and flushes bye-bye which she learned from once upon a potty. She also loves to yell ""Potty Power!"" when she went successfully. I am so thrilled with this video.I also recommend this video for children with mild disabilities."
5,My daughter started using the potty,My daughter watched this multiple times a day from the library and we had to buy it because we couldn't renew it anymore. She wouldn't part with it. She went from no interst in the potty to going all the time after watching this along with Elmo's Potty Time. She liked the songs in it to and sang them all day.
3,It's OK!,"I wish the video went over using the potty more! I have a 2 1/2 year old boy, and the video really didn't help."
3,Its ok.,This DVD is a cute but simple show that explains potty training to little ones. I found it too simple and for my son who is a late bloomer where potty training is concerned. He was not impressed with the simplicity of the songs and stories. I think this DVD is more geared to early potty trainers.
4,Songs that are catchy for young ones,Kids love this...parents not so much.Has catchy tunes and kids want to watch it over and over. Helpful learning tool.
3,it's ok,I had heard great things about it from another mom. She talked about how much her little boy liked it. My kid thought that it was ok.
1,"Potty Power, huh?","In this film 5 super heros have magical rings, that when the powers are combined form Captain Dump. They are 1. Corn 2. Peanuts 3. Pinworm 4. Spinach, and 5. Cheerios. With you powers combined I am Captain Dump! (All 5 in unison)Go Dump!Great film."
2,Toddler Entertainment,Our two-year old watched it for the first time last night and was literally pooping in her diaper as she watched. Seems to have missed the point on the initial attempt. She did ask to watch it again when it ended. At least it was entertaining to her.
2,should have bought new!,Looked in good condition but on four scenes the DVD stalled or the picture broke up which frustrated us and our child while we were viewing the tape.....in future will not buy DVD's that are used........
3,Best For Older Toddlers,"I bought this for my 26 month old grandson but he is clearly not ready, yet. No fault to the content, it is for children a bit older. We will bring it back out in about four months and try again."
5,Praises for Potty Power,"when it comes to potty training, this video is the video to get!! I have been trying to train my 4 year old twin boys for almost two years. I tried ""Its Potty Time""& ""once upon a potty"" niether of them made any impact and I was at my wits end. This video is the answer to my prayers,in the week since we got this video the twins are 90% trained! They love to watch it and interact with the video. Best of all, they do not want the diapers and it has them leaning toward the toilet and not their potty chair. Hooray for POTTY POWER!!!!"
2,Cute,It's a fairly cute movie but my kids didn't seem too interested. I think maybe one reason is it's based on a princess and I have boys. Two my children seem to be more intrigued with a cartoon rather than actual people.
5,It Works!!!,"It is no wonder it is #1 in toilet training, the DVD works! It really helped our first son speed along the process. And his mother agrees too that its a winner! Thanks Potty Power!!!"
1,Had my sons' interest for 2 minutes,"If I did not sit there with him for the whole 2 minutes he would have left the room. Really really cheesy, not entertaining, annoying to the parent, and well my son would have rather played in dirt."
4,Worked for My Daughter,"Great for little girls! It has catchy music, toddlers, interactive questions, and fun storylines complete with a princess who is learning to use the potty. My friend recommended this video to use when my not-quite-three year old daughter was STILL not using the potty! We watched this on a daily basis and about a week later she was fully potty trained. Not sure if a boy would be as interested, though I heard they have another DVD for just for boys now."
2,Not what I expected,It doesn't keep my 2 year old sons attention. Though it would be better with all of the great reviews.
5,Great Video,Perfect instruction video for your toddler - boy or girl. I was a bit skeptical that it would work for both but it does so beautifully. This video will make potty training so much easier than it did when I potty trained my children years ago.
4,Good Video,"I bought this for my kids. My daughter loved this video, and it helped her to understand about the potty process. I enjoyed playing the little games and singing the songs with her. My son didn't watch like my daughter; he would lose interest quickly - that's boys for you."
3,Geared more towards older kids,"Now that my daughter is 2, we are hoping to really ramp up the potty training and get things moving. She was introduced to it a while ago and knows the concepts, but just doesn't have much motivation. This DVD is geared more towards older kids, I would say 3 and up - kids who are able to get their pants up and down by themselves and wipe on their own and wash their hands by themselves. My daughter liked watching the video during the songs, but other than that she did not show much interest."
5,Potty Power,"I was shocked at how much my son loved this video! After 2 viewings, he began using the potty chair and was trained in a few short days. I have recommended this video to several friends and they too had great success."
4,"My son loves it, but...","He wet himself once yesterday and still can't seem to make the connection with going poopy! It's only 10:45 in the morning and he's already soiled his pants 3 times! This movie needs to make more emphasis on going poopy and how it won't feel any different than going in a diaper, it's just cleaner. I think that's the point missed by most books and movies, though. They show you how to do it, but kids seem to associate going poopy in the toilet as something ""different"" and therefore don't want to do it.Needless to say, he has watched it at least 2 dozen times since we got it 4 days ago!And when I put underwear on him, I say, ""What do you have??"" He says in return, ""POTTY POWER!"" It's cute!"
3,"Catchy songs, cute video. Not sure if it helped with potty training.","I got this for my son when he was 18 months old, right before his little sister was born, and we watched it many many times. He loved it and I did too. The songs were very singable and it really made the potty seem fun. Never the less, despite my best efforts, although he knew what to do, he was not using the potty independently until right before he turned three. My daughter watched it less, and was fully potty trained with very little effort by 22 months. I am not convinced the video did anything. Kids will train when they are ready, but it is fun to watch and I find myself singing the songs to myself all the time."
4,Daughter loves it,"I decided to purchase this product when my daughter, age 2, started refusing to use the potty and told me that she wanted to be a baby with diapers! She loves the video and is showing improvement. She also sings their potty song while on the potty which is really cute. We still have a long way to go but atleast she's showing a little interest in it again. I would definately recommend this product to anyone who's potty training but I do think it's geared more towards girls than boys."
5,true to it's name,This video is true to it's name. It really helped give my daughter some potty power! She loves watching it again and again as we potty train. She really enjoys being called a big kid. The book I read about potty training emphasized no more diapers and being a big kid. This video did the same. My daughter loves all the songs and I find myself singing them still. She also enjoys the Princess story in the video and the funny jester. The video does a great job of explaining all the steps of going potty.
5,Campy and engaging,"Admittedly this is a rare tv opportunity for my son, but he loves Potty Power. It helped him realize that he wants to be a big kid and do what big kids do. The first week he asked to watch it every day. We still sing the songs together and probably will for a while."
3,Pretty Good,"Songs are catchy and two year old loves it (so does one year old), but she's not potty trained yet."
3,pretty good,"I like this one, but my 2 year old son prefers ""Potty Time"" over ""Potty Power"" so I'm only giving it 3 starts. We do watch both of them, but he only asks to watch ""Potty Time."" I thought the ""big kid"" test (a series of examples of what babies do versus big kids) would have more of an impact, and maybe for other kids it will."
4,Catchy for kids,"I actually hated this video since it's condescending in many ways- but the catchy phrases such as ""potty power""- and the songs like ""I'm a big kid now.."" ""look what you can do by yourself"" etc.. it is catchy enough that my DD follows it.. what annoys me- well- the potty- how about a seat on a toilet? the sound quality is horrible, the kids seem way older than 3.. overall, better than some of the others I've seen so far.. and- biggest thing- DD likes it.."
4,Good Product/Good Price,They work really well with my TENS unit. The only drawback is that they don't maintain stickyness and contact as long as I would like.
5,Works well,You can reuse these time after time given you first clean the area of application with some rubbing alchol or something. I do recommend keeping the plastic so you can replace them in the sleeve when not in use.
4,They work,"We have a very old and works just fine TEMS machine and these pads will work with that. We had to retrofit the wire ends on our unit with new clips, and these are easy to hook up. They are reuseable with some care, do use an alcohol wipe to clean the skin and let dry before applying these, that will not only give better contact and extend reuseability. Carefully park the pads on the carrier plastic again when done.I have ordered these more than once because of price and that they work. I give a 4 because the first time or two they are very sticky .... and a second pair of hands and eyes are necessary for attachment and removal. Good product. The supplied product image shows 4 of the pads on the carrier, with the clip/push leads. You use them in pairs, and with our 2 lead set TEMS we use 4 at a time, 2 on each set of leads and it has two separate channels. So out of a package we get 6 sets of 4."
3,I HAVE TO ADMIT,"THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEIR BEST TAPES, BUT IF YOU ARE A FAN OF TALES FROM THE CRYPT I STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU GIVE ALL THREE EPISODES A SHOT. ITS NOT THAT THE EPISODES ARE BAD, ITS THAT THEY ARENT GOOD ENOUGH TO WANNA WATCH TWICE. END"
4,"Would be five stars, but...","I love the in-depth character of the book, from the beginning to around 1968. My only gripe is that, generally speaking, after about the fin-de-siecle age in Detroit, the focus of the residential aspects of the book shifts entirely to the Grosse Pointes, ignoring the buildup of neighborhoods such as Palmer Woods, Boston-Edison, Indian Village, Woodbridge, etc.That being said, the book is definitely worth purchasing, and I would very strongly suggest it for any fan of architecture in the Detroit area."
1,Stopped working after 4 months,Half the lights stopped working after 2 months. The entire thing stopped working after 4 months. What a complete waste of money.
3,Nice for no wind,"We bought this for our pond. Maybe we were wishing to much. The fog on a calm day is,,, ok but minimal. This product would be better used on a table top for Halloween."
4,Very good product,"We use this fogger in our 250 gallon outdoor pond. It took a little engineering in our part, but once we got it situated, it looked great. Seems to be very durable and well-made, although I do not know what is solar on the product we received, unless it is the brand name. Very reasonable price. Great effect!"
1,Item description is incorrect!,"This item states that it comes with a ""wireless remote control"" which it does not! I ordered this item specifically for this feature and was give a bad surprise when I opened the box.Granted this is a nice item but it's worthless to me without the controler. I had to return the item and order the proper one. The worst part about this is that I ordered this for holloween to go inside the pumkin so that I can win the competition I entered into. I had to pay for 2 day/saterday delivery so that the right item would show up on time due to the inacurate description. Not happy about that at all.I gave a 1 star because of the missleading item description, once it is revised I will be happy to revise my review and give it a proper rating.EDIT 11-4-07: the product desription still has yet to be changed. This item does not come with any form of control unit at all!"
3,Two flaws,"Poor selection of the material used to make the touchpad -- it makes my finger stick to it. I have an old Toshiba that doesn't have this problem. New Toshibas are also good in this regard. If I preferred to use a mouse, I'd buy this notebook.Also, the video picture made by its web cam pauses often. This isn't supposed to happen. This didn't happen even on another HP's model with an Intel processor (~ $1500).If these flaws don't bother you, I'd recommend it."
2,cheaply made,"We bought this just over 1 year ago and its falling apart, we can't close it right as the screen is coming apart and the disk tray no longer opens properly. We use it a lot but just here at the house and it doesn't get moved around a lot so this is not well worn and I am very disappointed by this cheap quality. The featuers are nice and it performs ok otherwise but opening and closing the unit and the disk drive should not be an ordeal. My dell desktop is much older and gets much more use and is still going strong, I made a real mistake not going to Dell for the laptop and will not make that mistake again!"
1,A great book for people with CLOSED minds,Susan McCrook wouldn't talk because she was afraid she'd end up taking an ADN (Akansas dirt nap). End of story.
5,The GOP owes her reparations,"I heard Susan many times on the radio during her persecution, but she was always constrained about what she could and couldn't say -- she couldn't call the guy with the keys to her cell a lying sack of --, for instance. This morning on KPFK, I heard her interviewed by Amy Goodman. A sane and courageous woman. If the right can't get the point now, I'm just sorry for them. They sponsored and were victimized by a genuine conspiratorial witchhunt, where political strategy completely took the place of morals and ethics. They will pay, eventually."
5,A story of Courage and conviction,When told from a first person point of view the whole evil mess of Watergate becomes breathtakingly frightening. That our judicial system could have become so compromised in the pursuit of partisan politics wasn't really clear to me as the investigation rolled on year after year. But now after reading this book and realising what Susan McDougal endured for the sake of defending her principals against the almighty U.S. justice department it is apparent that freedom in America should never be taken for granted.Bravo to the true heroism of this amazing woman
4,Such a Courageous woman to read about,"Although this book was assigned for my Government Summer School class, I definitely enjoyed reading this biography. This woman was so courageous in her struggles with Jim, Kenn Starr and the Clintons. Her life started as a middle child and ended as the middle man in a huge scandal. Whether it be as a child or an adult, she always stood that middle ground and she did it with pride, bravery and most of all courage. I strongly recommend reading this book; it was very interesting for me as I can see for many others as well."
5,Everyone should read about the truth!,"This book was absolutely excelletnt reading, I could not put it down! I knew there was more to Susan then the media was putting out. All the media cared about was trying to put down the Clintons. Susan had a very easy choice to make, put the Clintons down and walk! But instead, because of her moral upbringing and her desire to do the right thing"" she knew if she told the truth, her husband and others who took the deal would claim perjury, so her only choice was to say nothing and unfortunately it cost her. I really respect her and the truth always comes out in the end."
5,Hard to Put Down!,"This is one of those ""hard to put down"" books. McDougal presents all the action and history leading up to and going beyond her own suffering with the Watergate Trials. Usually when I resume reading a book after several days I must flip back some pages to remember the story line. Not so with this! ""The Woman Who Wouldn't Talk"" is a clincher! She reveals much about the real Jim McDougal, and many other players in this fallout. While not a close friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton, she was quite aware of the scandel being drummed up by the Investigative Committee, and went to prison rather than lie that the Clinton's participated in an under the table way."
5,A suprising story,This book is an incredible description of a woman living in the prison system. I thought this was going to be a political rant and I found this book to be fascinating. I could not put it down. It is extremely readable and matter of fact. A must read
3,Too narrow in focus,"Too narrowly focused on Mid West conditions. While it had a lot of useful information, things like ice fishing have limited usefulness for the entire US. If you live in Minnesota, Wisconsin, etc. this would probably be one to own. For California there would be better choices."
1,Not very useful,"I got this book before my trip to Thailand and Vietnam. The truth is that I didn't use it, because it's almost imposible to pronounce something from this book and be understood by the locals, or get a word from locals and try to figure it out what it means! I wouldn't recommend it, I think you better try to get some words or phrases in town better than trying to get something from this book."
3,R.Kelly?,The song that is written by R.Kelly is okay you can see why this group is not around any more.
4,pretty fresh song,"ok, well not many people actually have heard of talent, and to be honest I never heard that much of them before I got the cd single. I saw the video and wuz feelin tha song. I thought the song had a fat beat and the whole message wuz tight. the snippets on the celebrity single cd are really good, and i would definately get tha whole cd."

5,Excellent Value and a Great Price,Title says it all. I really like that this monitor has built-in speakers as it gives me more room and less clutter on my desk.
5,Fresh Step Review,Fresh Step clumping cat litter is the best it keeps our litter boxes from smelling even if I don't scoop them everyday. I have used this brand of litter prior to buying it on amazon. This was a great deal especially since the shipping was free and the product arrived quickly. I never buy other brands of cat litter Fresh Step is the best.
4,"Prefer Fresh Step Lavender, or Arm & Hammer Essentials, but this works great","I prefer Fresh Step Lavender (it took care of odor & made my house noticeably pleasant more so than air freshners); or, I also prefer Arm & Hammer Essentials, but this works great. You need to look around for best deal for size, but I never have odor problems with my two cats with this Fresh Step Scoopable litter. Tidy Cat and Johnny Cat both worked OK until I got a second cat and then for whatever reasons cat # two wasn't so great for odor and good clumping with those brands. If I couldn't get 1) Fresh Step Lavender; or 2) Arm & Hammer Essentials Natural Clumping, then I'd pick this version of Fresh Step Scoopable and if I couldn't get any of the above, I'd go for Arm & Hammer Super Scoop (Fresh Scent)."
2,Zzzzz....,"I bought this book a couple years back when a friend recommended it. I haven't ever taken so long to complete a book but finally, last week, two years later, I completed it.I had never made it past 5 pages without falling asleep; thanks to this book, my sleeping medication is something I haven't had to take in a long time. I am very very upset that this book is done... Now, I have to read chapters at a time of other books to feel as tired as I do with this one.Seriously, most of this review is 100% true. This might be a very good history book of DNA research but it's about as much fun as having a root canal while being gang raped in a prison shower. If you have to read this book for some reason, I suppose it is filled with the facts. If you don't have to read this book... Well... It's not much fun. Oh, there are lots of very BIG words though."
2,Watery mess!,"Wanted to love this product. I bought the gift set which was not cheap. This stuff actually does help with a raw behind but I can't use it most the time. When u go to squeeze out the ointment, this water /oily mess pours out. I have tried massaging the tub prior to squeezing it but it does not help. It gets everywhere and on top of that, the water/ oil mixture prevents the ointment from being able to rub into the skin. I have since bought a natural cream from Babyganics Nd it's great. Just as natural for half the price and works great."
5,the smart little mouse,"this was a trip down memory lane. My mom read it to me and to my daughters. Now I can read it to my grandchildren. An endearing book with colorful illustrations, children of all ages will love this story."
5,the best to come outta denmark these days,"well, if you're reading this one there is no question about the fact that you should buy this crazy album right this second...you really need it if you've come all this way ;O)it is by far Powersolo at their very greatest!!!!!you've got a little bit of everything on this very cool album, above all an amazing 'let's-not-take-everything-so-seriously' attitude and of course a tremendous amount of indeed so nice musical craftsmanship...to lead this phenomenon of an example of music created on DK soil, you have the most amazing front guy any band could ever ask for - the kim kix...the only equally 'superdooper' thing to do (besides buying this record) is to check out Powersolo live...i know it's a rare thing in America but you will never ever be disappointed...austin, tx is a wise place to start...go donkey punkin'!!!"
3,Comprehensive Cherokee polital upheaval after the Trail of Tears,"I must confess that I bought this book because I write historical fiction about the Cherokees during the time period immediately after 1839. It proved very beneficial in many ways, however I found very little about the common Cherokee. The individuals who were not Chiefs or part of the political struggles of the tribe. However, if you are looking for a very well told account of the struggle as a nation, this is a very good book."
3,The Girl-Getters,"Oliver Reed is usually good....a little flat in this one.But, he is still a great actor who passed on before his time"
1,I would not reccomend this item.,"I would not reccomend this item. It is too large and hard for a normal size ear,even with attachments. Sorry but I would not reccomend."
1,Did not work.,I am returned mine - does not work at all. I had the volume on HIGH and still didn't make any difference - just a hissing sound.
1,Buy replacement batteries on ebay for $1.20/100,I bought this device for my 83 y.o. Dad. He liked it at first. It broke within the first 2 months. Also the batteries last like 8 hours max. The local drugstore sells each battery for like $5.00. Try going to ebay and ordering them like I did for $1.20 plus $5. shipping for 100/pack. Better deal. I would buy one again if they were made sturdier...and I paid $29.99 for our broken one. Next time will go to amazon first.
1,NOT GOOD,"MY HUSBAND WANTED TO TRY SOME KIND OF HEARING DEVICE. I FOUND THIS SOUND SYSTEM. WAS HOPINGTO BE ABLE TO USE TILL COULD AFFORD A HEARING AID. THIS IS NOT A GOOD SOUND SYSTEM. MAYBE ONCEIN A WHILE THERE WAS A VERY FAINT SOUND AS IF IT WERE TURNED TOO LOUD. NO AMPLIFICATION AT ALL. SORRY TO SAY FOR HIM. """" NO GOOD """" SORRY WE WASTED THE MONEY."
1,"This is junk , if like me and others yours doesn't work at all.","I thought I'd try this for my dad as a first step to hearing loss solutions. It was less than $20. Unfortunately, I held it for him as a gift too long too return to the seller. It never worked. I checked the batteries on a voltmeter they were fine. After this, I tried to fix it myself - I don't recommend it. I think the next cheapest alternative is about $75 on ebay. Good luck - avoid this, unless you're prepared to return yours if it's a dud."
1,Poor Choice,"I bought this for my 89 year old mother. Although it did work, the battery lasted only a few hours. This was not the bad part, it continually fell out of her ear. For 2 weeks I tried every way to put it in but it never stayed in. I returned the product and still have not gotten a refund months later."
2,Magni Ear,Batters don't last and it was difficult operating the battery holder the tab of which soon broke off. I would buy another one if the battery holder was improved.
3,not bad,i bought this for my father. He said it did work. but he has to set volume to the highest. The battery only can last up to 6 hours. better to buy a rechargable one.
3,"easy to use, not good at sound quality","It is bought for my parents, but not working well for them.The sound is amplified as it's supposed to be, but also the noise is amplified."
2,Magni Ear Minus,The LR-41 battery clip is very fragile and the single point of failure. I've owned two and both of them died this way within a month or two of part-time use. There are much better choices for the money!
3,for the money...,"I bought the spare batteries for two cents each here on Amazon..so coupled with the device, Jimmy is happy enough. keeps us from shouting or our ear drums busting from the tv for him."
3,ok for price,It was ok for the price but not to user friendly the volume control was hard to operate it did not have a slot in it.
4,Delivers what it promises,"This is not hearing aid, but hearing amplifier. And it delivers what it promises. Nice and compact. And works well. I would buy this in future. Thought batter cabin can do with some improvement."
1,Not Acceptable amplification,I had hoped that this device would enable me to hear the TV at a sound level that would be comfortable for others but as it does not decsriminate bewteen spoken and room noise or background clatter I was unable to use it. The ear pieces are uncomfortable and did not allow any satisfactory length of use.
1,Not much good for voices,"I didn't expect a lot, so I can't say I'm disappointed, and this might work for some things. For instance, if a person was profoundly deaf and couldn't hear a knock at the door, the beep of the microwave oven, or a car honking at them as they wandered through traffic, this would probably make a real difference.However, for speech it doesn't help, at least in my case. It actually does amplify the speech, but if you can't read lips it will be hard to understand what's going on... sounded so distorted that if I listened with my eyes closed and my finger in my ""good"" ear, I couldn't understand anything being said around me. I could tell they were talking, but that's all. I think this may give the illusion of hearing better, since there IS sound coming out of it, but for understanding speech it isn't useful."
1,Could be dangerous,I am a specialist in the field of hearing and sometimes use cheaper amplifiers from the electronic store carefully to help students temporarily. A friend brought these in after his mother stated she couldn't stand them. I was shocked at the sound levels that appeared to be coming out of them with no compression or reasonable limits! My opinion is that without proper documentation at to maximum SPL these should be assumed to be potentially dangerous to a person's remaining hearing.
2,amp system,its ok but i could just find the batteries somewhere else for cheaper. its ok if you want to use something for temporary but this isnt good for everyday use.
1,horrible,"i thought this product would help my husband hear at least have the tv lower and be able to communicate in a normal conversation.First the high pitched sound, then it would not stay in his ear and now I'm trying to return the darn thing. Do No waste your mone or time."
1,It's Cheap!,"I bought it for my father and the battery cover broke after short time of usage, it's just too cheap."
2,Bad Product,I bought 2 machines together but both the machines are not working well. Real Bad product.
1,Bigger for my ears,This piece is far bigger than my ears. It looks really odd when I wear this. I have returned the product.
3,not bad,I actually found to be really good for the price. But I had to return it as it was too big for my ear.
4,Reflections of Many Colors,"What struck me when reading Trinkie Peterson's ""Paris Reflections"" was the variety of subjects she tackled, all with meticulous artistry. She is a therapist (Why not admit That you are not perfect? Life includes random draws From a bag of imperfections) a lover (When I could hold you in my arms, Just the two of them for all or you) a loving daughter (For You Dadwas my favorite) a voyeur of society (Don't Talk Lucy is comical, An Ordinary Fairy Tale is serious and alarmingly up to date) and much more. This book is a little gem and deserves a place on any serious poet's shelf."
5,The undisputed guide for BGP!,"Don't be taken by the size of the book - it's packed with information on BGP-run infrastructures. From basic BGP applications, to case-scenario aggregations and confederations (even a complete list of CLI commands), simply the best text on the subject!"
4,A good BGP primer,"The title is a bit misleading. While this book briefly touches other protocols (link state vs. distance vector and Halabi favors link state), it is a solid BGP resource and a valuable resource for understanding BGP in all its gory detail. The title should have been: All you wanted to know about BGP but was afraid to ask. It is complete BGP resource."
4,The BGP Bible,"If you want to understand BGP. Then you need to read the bible of BGP. If this book isn't in your library, then go add it."
5,Updated version of the original,"This book is the updated version of the original book. It has quite a bit more information than the first book, and should be required reading for anyone wanting to pass the CCIE written or LAB exams."
5,TO BUY,"Only a word, Buy IT!If you want to know how internet works and how works on cisco router, You Must Buy IT."
4,Wonderful Holiday Recipe Book,"I have had this recipe book for about 5 years, but love it so much that I ordered another one for my son so that he can cook the holiday favorites too. The different types of situations, like Caroler's Buffet, etc with the suggested menus is very helpful. I plan to serve pork crown roast for Christmas day and the presentation is very stunning, with all the side dishes.. I recommend also getting the newer edition of this book also as it has some great ideas on table settings, name tags, gifts, etc"
3,Somewhat disappointed.,"A well crafted watch, however I purchased the two-tone. The gold tone wore-off within the first month."
3,Not what I expected and wonder how long it stays on.,"I thought this is what install in the window channel. It actually adhere to the auto body directly. I must have read thru' different product descriptions and ordered this one mistakenly. It relies solely on the tapes and I wonder how long can the tape hold. After installation, I can have the window down a little for fresh air but saw a small gap near the mirror. It may be my inexperience in the installation and I wish I can go back in time.Maybe this can last for more than a year ?"
5,Manners in a nutshell,Gimme Gimme gimme are words we hear way to often from children. Yet when they are given something there is no THANK YOU.A Basic manners MUST HAVE. Sometimes parents are not teaching basic manners. You are never too young to learn.
5,Brings back the feeling of the era,"If you are old enough to recall Nixon's visit to China, this music may evoke more feeling than for others who do not remember that China was often referred to as a country we ""lost"" to communism. Back then communism was a curse word, not the name of a way to organize an economic system. Nixon could go to China because he had cut his political teeth on anti-communism; we could trust him not to sell out to them. Although the men are center stage, the character of Pat Nixon is sung with delightful emotion and captures the essence of her: the dutiful wife and mother;the yet it reveals perhaps that there was more to her than that. Madam Mao evokes the pride she feels being Chairman Mao's wife; yet it hints at a great sadness that tells us of her secret troubles. Kissinger is Kissinger in parody, perhaps his real self. Mao and Dick uncover deep secrets and fears. Just go buy this, learn a little history. I love this work."
2,A Waste of Commission Money,"This terrible, trite, insipid piece of music was a waste of a commission. Unbelievably repetitive at every level. Find some of Adams' inspired earlier music rather than this tripe.The only thing worse is experiencing a live performance...awful sets ..The recording is fine."
5,We Love the Mirror,"The mirror is high quality and I was very impressed with the fast delivery. I was worried about buying a mirror through the mail, but the packing material was very well done."
4,"A overwhelming book for the layman, a fair read for the motivated","I bought this book to get a good handle on Proportional Integral control for HVAC work. This book is loaded with every control theory thought up by mankind. Not a coffee table book to simply gloss over concepts, in the hopes no one finds out that you're an overpaid clod. You will need to have your math skills in order. Has the magical properties to either inspire, or put to sleep any near genius."
2,"Okay, But Not Thrilled","This handbook is good to have as a reference. However, there are much better handbooks out there, which are better organized by topic. After purchase, I read it once and have not found myself revisiting it since. Again, it is good as a tool for control engineers, but not the best."
4,Used a wheel barrel to get it to my workshop.,"Nice heavy unit that does not move around and need not be bolted.Does not receive five stars because it takes a brain surgeon to square the fence to the table. I know there will be the usual reation to this,(will I didn't have any problems), but blow me down and run me over if you think it was easy. Other than that I am very pleased!!"
1,damaged goods,"Twice, I never got to use this tool because they came severely damaged from shipment. The inside packaging is so weak the heavy tool is easily broken."
2,Run Away!,"This is made in China and apparently packaged for surface transport only in China. The packaging is so inadequate that it's a virtual certainty it will arrive damaged.There were screws and bolts rattling around inside the carton, the styrofoam was crushed. Upon inspection, the power cord strain relief was broken off leaving the cord itself in a ragged hole with sharp edges.After unsucsessfully adjusting the infeed table I discovered one of the leveling bolts was sheared off in the casting making it impossible to align. I took the machine apart and found that the entire casting that supports the infeed table was broken in half.This very same machine is available from ShopFox and also from Sears Crafstman, I strongly reccomend buying it from Sears if you choose to buy it at all, One less trip in a truck might do it good. Parts should be redily available from Sears as well. They sell it for @249. every day."
5,Fantastic!,"I just got this jointer tonight and my first reaction was ""Wow, that's heavy!"". I needed the hand truck to get it into the basement, but it was worth it. 30 minutes later, it was set up and both the 90 degree and 45 degree stops were dead-on right out of the box. I ran a few test cut on some oak and maple and was very pleased with the results; straight, smooth, what more could I ask? I don't have a lot of room, so most of my tools (with the exception of the table saw) are benchtop models; this is the beefiest of any of them! I should mention that the chip/dust collection work great, but it does require either a 30 gallon trash can or a 30 gallon garbage bag. I've seen poor reviews of other benchtop jointers, but I can't think of anything else I could want on this one except, perhaps, a depth-of-cut gauge."
5,I'm impressed,"I am an amateur weekend woodworker, and this is my first jointer.My impressions:Palmgren must have improved its packing after previous reviews. Mine was double boxed and had sufficient styrofoam to protect it. Had no damage.Set up is quick and easy. The instructions are clear and the fence is accurate and solid.Jointed several pieces of rock-hard red oak from rough to nicely smooth in a couple of passes. Fairly quiet, too.I was dubious about the dust collector, but it works surprisingly well, and will adapt to an external collection system with no fuss.Overall, I am extremely pleased with this product. It will provide no end of help with my projects. I would recommend it higly, and will consider Palmgren purchases in the future."
5,Delivery/Product,"Product arrived a week early. Product as advertised. Shipping container not damaged, product not damaged, all parts included in box. A good shopping experience. Product works as advertised."
2,"Go for better one, indeed","After 8 months using this jointer, I can say that there is a review here which is spot on.1. Bench top jointer occupies more space than stationary 6"" jointer.2. No more that 4-foot long board could be accurately jointed3. Loud, no. Very loud. God bless my neighbors4. Outfeed table cannot be adjusted at all5. Infeed table and fence do not hold setting. Well they may hold when tiny boards are jointed.All in all, expensive mistake!"
4,Very nice,"This is a heavy, solidly built, quality machine. It got here in four days on free shipping! Easy to set up, easy to adjust for precision I need. I build jewelry and keepsake boxes, so it is the perfect size. It works like a champ for me. The dust collection system was an interesting assembly, but it works amazingly well, not one splinter or shred went anywhere except into my trash bag. The shiping box had a few dings on it, but it did not affect the merchandise at all. Sears had this same model as a Craftsman, but was $20 plus shipping higher than Amazon. Interesting reading if you are considering this jointer is Palmgren's website. I think I'll buy Palmgren products more often.UPDATE: It's been about 18 months since I put this into work. Never a hick-up. Have sharpened and changed blades one time each. Very easy to do IF you make a jig first. But you would use a jig for any blade work on a jointer. UNPLUG for safety!"
5,"very nice machine, great service","I just received my joiner planer yesterday and save for some shipping damage, It setup fast and easy. even with some damage to the chip tube and adapter to the bag I was able to use the joiner yesterday. It has plenty of power for the work I do and give a nice smooth and square surface. I contacted Palmgren today about the broken parts and they were fast and courteous with getting the partson the way, It was a pleasure to deal with real people on the phone and there willingness to provide excellant customer service."
4,"Great product, lousy packing.","I agree with the other reviewers that this is a great heavy duty cast iron jointer. (Shipping weight is 115 lbs.) Since I am an Amazon Prime member, my jointer arrived by free UPS second day air. The down side: The internal styrofoam packaging was completely smashed when it arrived. Since most parts of the unit are cast iron, this is not too big of a deal. However, the plastic dust collection port was smashed into little bits. I am using duct tape to hold a dust collection bag in place. This is not a big enough problem to deal with shipping this beast back for a replacement. Besides, the packaging is so poor, that I'll bet that most all of them arrive with a broken plastic dust collection port."
3,Estee Lauder Pure Color Lipstick,"This was the lipstick brand and color that I wanted, and expected. However, the product was old and sort of dried out. Not as badly dried out as the product that I ordered through Amazon from a different vendor, but not the quality of an in-store purchase."
1,Not the same product as in the store,"This product was meant to replace an existing #187 Sunstone that was purchased in the store. Unfortunately, this product was different in color and texture. If you want to get the real thing, I recommend buying in the store."
5,Just What I Expected - Excellent Lipstick,I choose 5 stars because I have used Sunstone #187 before and got just what I wanted and quickly too.
5,Nice size swing set/climber for toddlers,This Step 2 product is perfect for my 2 year old daughter. She loves it. The slide is a little fast for her but I'm sure she'll grow into it. Fairly easy to put together as well.
3,"Frustrating, poor design.","I bought this swing set for my [...] daughter and my niece [...]. For starters, have it delivered. The boxes are huge and you will most likely need to take it out of the box to get it home. My husband had a very difficult time putting it together. The earth where we live is quite rocky and the spikes they enclose had flat heads in stead of points so getting it in the ground was almost impossible. It took several hours and we are still not sure if it is in the ground securely. The directions are given as pictures with some hints of what to do. We are both educated individuals and would have appreciated better directions. We found that some of the long bolts where not long enough and that you need a ratchet set. My daughter and niece where finally able to enjoy the play set after hours of ""is it done yet""? Our only hope is that the play set stays in the ground and that our girls are safe."
3,need help please,"How do we get a part please from an Amazon order?We bought the Step@ Naturally playful playhouse climber and swing extensionThe smaller box had the swings and frame in it, that was the box that the came with a duplicate male attachment, it was the female attachment (it is a large plastic a- frame attachment) that was missing.Step 2 The swing extension box 1 of 2 # 7543/7232KRParts list part B inside Wall (female part)How can we get JUST this part sent please?Gret piece of equipment but cannot be fully used"
1,disappointed too small,WE recently bought this for our 2 yr old son as a bday present.I thought it was the perfect combo between a playhouse and swingset. First off the box it comes in is huge so it had to be taken out of the box to fit into my car (large SUV). When we got it home... it was a little complicated to put together. We got it together finally only to find out our son was too tall to fit in the house under the platform. He is only 2 and not incredibly tall for his age. Also he barely fit down the slide.. it is very narrow. We ended up having to take it apart and return it. I don't know how a 3 yr old would ever fit in the playhouse section.
3,Toddler Swing Set,"This is perferct for toddlers. Very Durable. Very Safe It has faded some. The Big pain is when you move it...if the slide pops out is is impossible to get back in.We have had this swing set for about 5 years. My girls are 6 & 8 they say they are to small for it..""Its for a baby"". I wish for the money I paid for this one I would of gotten a wood set or rainbow. My girls have played many more hours on the cheap walmart (...) one at grandparents house.Adults cant fit in swing(NO I'M NOT FAT EITHER).So I am donating ours to Church.Perfect for short term ...kids out grow it fast."
1,Book on Discontinued MMO's,"This book concentrated on two online games, one that has gone to the MMO game graveyard. Very disappointing book. I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,Dimensions? What dimensions!,"I was looking for a smaller maps. The 38"" is correct, however the 2.0"" listed is not a mistaken 20"" width. The 38"" is the width...! Beware, it is more expensive to send back than they are worth.These may be a wonderful maps, if you have the wall to post it on."
4,A successful gift!,I ordered these maps as a gift to my homeschooled niece and nephews. The report I received in reply was quite positive. These are excellent maps; an outstanding resource (and can be used with dry-erase markers).I'm very pleased to recommend this product.
5,Maps US with States and World with Countrys,These maps were exactly what I was looking for. They are large and readable with colors to set apart each state or country. You will enjoy these maps and your children will learn easily from them.
5,Great Product,"These maps were just what I was looking for. The maps are large enough to actually read. And although they are not laminated cardstock (like what some of the other reviewers were expecting), it is still laminated and serves its purpose. I have one up in my 7 year old's bedroom and he absolutely loves it. And I have the other up in the closet. For the price, I think this was a great buy."
1,The maps are beautiful...BUT....,While they're lovely maps and exactly what I wanted they are NOT LAMINATED. To even claim that they are thinly laminated is a farce. What I received was VERY delicate paper that had some corners already a bit shredded straight out of the box. Therefore all I can say is that I did NOT receive the advertised product and I am so disappointed.
5,Hemingway Colloquium: The Poet Goes To Cuba,"This book stuns. It is stunningly crafted and stunningly written, containing some of Locklin's best work, to be cherished by Locklin lovers and Hemingway lovers. Locklin will take you to Hemingway's Cuba as no one has done before, and you will be with Locklin all the way via his magnetic poetry. The book itself is old-fashioned, a piece of craft rather than a bunch of paper and glue. I recommend doing as I did--buy 2 copies, one to read all night (I did), and one to keep for your grandchildren, so that they can sell it to pay for their college tuition."
5,My favorite soap,I just brought three boxes of three and one large bar of this lovely soap back from France. It is and has been my favorite for years. The green tea scent is light and lovely. The soap is luxurious. Don't hesitate. Treat yourself and someone you love with this.
5,Splurge!,"I splurged one night on a small package of Roger & Gallet Green Tea Soap. Now, it is my favorite soap. Green Tea is my favorite scent and no other green tea scent in other brands compares. This is green tea in its purest form. Roger & Gallet has some other lovely fragrences. Try lily-of-the-valley. It's a hint of spring even in winter."
3,Battle of the Coral Sea,The title of the movie is is not what the movie is about.This movie is 1 hour 45 minutes of Cliff Robertson andGia Scala and 15 minutes of the actual Coral Sea battle.Dissapointing to say the least.
2,The title is misleading,This is NOT a movie about the battle of the coral sea. It is a movie about a sub captain who lost his boat and he and his crew are captured my the japs before the balle of the Coral sea.
3,Battle of the coral sea,"The dvd is in it's self good, the movie is realy poorly done for a cliff robertson movie. The story line is not writen very good and realy does not have anything to do with the battle it self, as I would have thought the title was going to portray some seans from the war."
1,Very little to do with the Coral Sea Naval Battle,I know the histroy of this very important battle. This story is objectionable and insulting to the people who were involved.
5,Yanni's Best!,"Although this is one of Yanni's collections from some time back, it is my personal favorite. This is Yanni at his best!"
5,My favorite CD in my collection.,This CD ebbs and flows so well. I feel happy and sad and excited at different times. I love that it is all instrumental. Nothing hides or covers the music. You can listen and really get into it or use it as background.
4,HOPE IN SICKNESS,"Dr. Siegel's second book is less striking than his first (Love, Medicine and Miracles) but it continues on the same theme that ""terminal"" illness is not necessarily so. Anecdotal reviews of cases he has experienced belie the assertion that only medicine and doctors can effect a healing when there is a diagnosis of serious illness. Quality of life is improved for a patient who is facing imminent death if the patient wants to participate in his care and the doctor is willing to allow him to do so. Recommdended reading for those who help the older generation, such as volunteers who participate in the ""Meal on wheels"" program."
4,A Detailed Study,"There have been many studies of this great battle, most of them written from the French perspective. After all, winners usually write history. This book is different in that the author is familiar with the Russian and Austrian perspectives and looks at the battle from both sides. The author's research is impeccable and detailed and provides a lot of insight into how the battle was lost as well as how it was won. The author is a competent but not inspiring writer, so this is not a fast read. This is probably not the best book to read as an introduction to the battle but will be very useful to the advanced student of Napoleonic warfare."
4,A great addition to the history of the Napoleonic wars,This book is a good overview of the diplomatic and military defeats of the Third Coalition by Napoleon. It outlines the troubles between Austria and Prussia and how the Russians failed to react in time to Napoleons drive. Napoleon's generals were simply able to outperform all of the participants involved. The prose is directed and easy to read. You do not really need any prior knowledge of Napoleon to read this book and for those who are knowledgeable in Napoleon this book may drag on a little at times. Overall though it provides good information and is a worthwhile addition to any Napoleonic library.
3,"COMPLETE AND THOROUGH, BUT DULL","As a number of other reviewers have stated, this is a very complete and thorough examination of the Austerlitz campaign and battle, giving more focus to the the Russian Army than some previous studies, but this is definitely warranted. However, my primary complaint is the exceedingly dry and tedious writing style of the author. I will not present myself as an expert on the Napoleonic Wars, but I have read well over 100 books on the subject, and this book is a struggle to complete each page. There is very little sense of the tremendously varied interesting, compelling, and dynamic leaders of this age. These were some real characters, men of flesh and blood, and more than a few wrinkles, but compelling figures then, and now, but one fails to comprehend that in this book. Good history is not a mere recitation of facts; it should make at least some attempt to transport you back in time. I believe this book fails on that level."
2,Not for Napoleon Fans...,"This is a book about how the Allies lost at Austerlitz, not about how Napoleon and the French won. Mr. Goetz does state in his intro that this will be construed as the ""Allied version"" of events and he wasn't kidding. We get blunder after blunder and the incompetency of command of the Allies in great detail, and the Allied details are great if you're into that sort of thing, but the French accounts are sparse. I wanted to learn how a great battle was won, not lost. I will be buying a different book on Austerlitz to get the taste of defeat which comes with this one out of my mouth."
1,Meh,"The music was simply not to my taste. It just didn't evoke any sort of atmosphere for me, either Elven or dream-like."
3,Good potential but missed in the delivery,"I started reading this book with high hopes and expectations and finished it feeling less than satisfied. While the authors presented interesting theories as to how the Democratic Party could make advances in the mostly Republican-held South and Midwest, the number of successful examples they presented were few. They seemed to revolve solely around their participation in the election of Mark Warner for governor of Virginia. So would these proposed tactics work in other states? I think the jury is still out.What I found more disturbing about the book was the blatant hostility and name-calling the authors decided to include in their text. Their interesting ideas get lost in between the lines of equating the GOP with Satan. At times I felt as though I was reading a book by a Democratic Ann Coulter. I really was expecting a better product than what I read."
1,Never mentions Saddam Hussein's terrible crimes against humanity,"Like how the Iraqi dictator (officially former president) killed 182,000 kurds in just one year. These and other important facts are useful in deciding how right Dubya was to take Saddam down.I say Bush was very right!Also this book is constantly harping on the fact that John Kerry served in the US Armed forces in VietNam during the VietNam War and Dubya served only stateside during that same conflict as if this all makes Kerry necessarily a better leader for the US during the war. In 1917 the USA was successfully led into World War One by President Woodrow Wilson who had no military experience at all. George W. Bush was more personally military than Wilson the former can lead the US successfully into war!"
3,Good book to start configuring SAP-SD.,"This book is a good start for someone who wants to use SAP-SD module.It is good for implementing SD, but lacks issues relating to specific issues (like warehousing, bar coding interfaces).Otherwise it is a good reference book for both consultants and end-users alike."
2,Best one for Introduction,"This is the best book to have the glimpse of SD, in some cases detailed too. But once you are into SD, there is hardly any thing new that you can know from this book.The author presents the concepts in a clear crispy way so that one can understand easily with less Business background.I suggest this book if you want to start learning a topic but not to master it.I can rate it 5 * for an SD Novice but a single * for whom who knew the concepts."
3,Great Vitamins but Copper Free version Sometimes Sent,"This is a great combination of vitamins that I've really enjoyed using but so far, it's that rare combination of having neither Copper nor Iron, which is a much safer formulation, especially for men and it includes a great spectrum of vitamins including others that normally aren't part of a multi like Choline.However, I've ordered it four times and two of those four times sellers have sent the wrong item. I've had great Amazon customer service but I still can't figure out how to get it fixed. I don't know if it's UPC confusion or just the confusing title of Copper/Iron Free; I notice this item is a big seller in the Copper category but it shouldn't even be in the Copper category, that's bad classification just by noting the word in the title an ignoring ""free""Crown Organic Exchange and 5 Stars Natural sent the version with Copper which is not this UPC or Title. NetRush sent the correct one."
3,Clue Sheet is Good for Beginners,"If you are a beginner, these sheets provide a good quick reference. However you will soon outgrow these and will wonder if it was worth the price."
1,0 Stars! Worthless!,Absolutely worthless! The only way these would be a workable product is if the depth was custom made for a product. These were several inches too deep for my door so the back end was several inches past the window. I tried trimming it by cutting a few inches from the front and attempting to fold cut flaps back for scews but it was completely unworkable. I ended up throwing them away. DO NOT waste your money.
2,"Keeps out water and debris, ruins sound","I installed these with some 6.5"" coax speakers in the doors of my truck. Easy to install, and they are tough enough to squash into the speaker opening. However, they mostly just ruined the sound. Sounds like the speakers (Infinity Reference 6.5"" co-ax) were stuck in a can, lots of midrange ""echo-y"" sound, and zero bass. I removed them and the speakers sound normal again. I'm glad they're cheap, and i won't buy these again. If you need to protect speakers, you'd be better off building a custom enclosure."
2,Ok product,Doesnt really make all that much difference from what I've noticed. Took them out and didn't see a big change.
3,great beginers book,"This book is a great book for ANYONE who doesn't know one thing about cooking. The book gives the novice all the information to go into other cook books. It explains what everything is; baking, pastas, seasonings, and even cook ware. I really love this book as a starting place it not only has made me a better cook but I feel more comfortable ordering food."
3,Not finished,"Still in the process of reading the book. It's a quick easy read and very interesting. Since the book is out of print, I was very glad that I was able to get it through Amazon."
5,Great read for Meatloaf fans,"A biography of one of the biggest stars of the 70s with a great come back in the 90s.There are several great singer/songwriter duos: Lennon and McCartney: Elton John and Bernie Taupin, then Meatloaf and Jim Steinman. This book details Meatloafs life and how he and Jim Steinman came together to collaberate one of the biggest selling albums of all time. Bat Out Of Hell is still a classic for all true lovers of music and story telling via music. A must read!!"
2,A small book from a big man,"Surprisingly, this is a small -- and not too impressive -- book from a big man. Written in a roughly chronological but too scattershot style, the book is riddled with typos and misinformation that clutter things further. I like Meatloaf as much as the next guy but. . ."
2,Very disappointing . . .,"Only 3/4 of the way through, and having to force myself to finish the book. I am such an avid Meat Loaf fan - still am - but wonder if the problem is with the book, or the writer, or there really isn't that much to tell. Bits and pieces, or recollections, albeit short ones, of his life which I'm sure are very memorable to him, but are just hit or miss to the reader. Sometimes what might be important to me during my life, might not grasp the reader in the same way. Wayyyyyy to much name dropping - who he met along life's journey - which had not the slightest impact on who he is today. Who cares??? A 5 second meet & greet, means nothing except you can brag ""you met"" or ""saw"" this or that celebrity.I was hoping for a little more of a book instead of bits and pieces, little moments neither here nor there. Still trying to add it all up as to what makes the man who he is today."
4,Larger Than Life? You bet!,"It seems that every experlative known to man has been used to describe Meat Loaf at some time or another. In this book he takes you briskly through a life story that confirms almost everything you've ever heard or thought about him. This incredible tale gives us insight into one of rock's true sagas. A vastly enjoyable, not too taxing read, the book leaves you rooting for him to conquer the world for a third time! I for one hope he does!"
5,Educative and entertaining,"Hard to put down. Reads from a journal prospective of many adventurous sojourns to Bolivia. I can appreciate that because it gives a lot of different takes on various desitnations, all from individual travellers. Witty, humorous, and full of incredible experiences; but also some well learned lessons and places to avoid. This book has enlightened me to the romance and adventure of taking the back road while backpacking on my forthcoming trip to Bolivia."
1,Disappointing,"Given all the five-star reviews for this book, I feel a bit out of the mix by describing it as 'disappointing', but it was. Having spent two years travelling in Bolivia, while researching and writing the first four editions of Lonely Planet's Bolivia book, I'm a serious 'Bolivia-phile'. The biggest problem with the book was the lack of editing and vetting, plus the frequently mistaken - however innocent the mistakes may have been - conclusions reached by the diarists. Also, most of the journeys described seemed rather mundane, given the scope of what's available in Bolivia. I suppose there's some interest to be found in the descriptions of these journeys - after all, they deal with an absolutely magical country - but few of the diarists manage to get below the surface appearances and find much beyond 'been there, done that'."
5,ONE Shining Star,"As the title implies, this set contains the greatest Transformers episode EVER, which is the reason it garnered the 5 star rating. However, The other two tapes in this set are abysmally stupid, with poor quality animation, and lame stroylines. ""Grimlock's New Brain"" is decent, but nowhere close the Return of Optimus Prime. Why did rhino have to release those [crummy] tapes? If they were smart, they would've done: Tape 1: The Key to Vector Sigma, parts 1 & 2 Tape 2: The Search for Alpha Trion and Dark Awakening, and the Tape Three: The return of Optimus prime. Then, we'd get 6 great episodes, and only have to pay for one three pack, instead of getting all three (Which I'd do anyway, but whatever). To put it all into focus, Tape 7: Incredible. Tape 8: Abysmally bad Tape 9: ""Grimlock's New Brain"" makes this one decent. You're almost better off buying JUST tape 7..."
5,Sardonic Gold,"I've known James Rogauskas for 20 years, and have always enjoyed his bitter, sardonic wit. He has struck comedic gold here. Fans of _The Office_ and of Matt Groening's _Work is Hell_ collection should order it immediately!-- Matt Posner"
5,great product!,This is a great product that I have been using for years. It helps detangle your hair when washed and smooth and shiny once its styled. I would highly recommend it!
5,Fermodyl 619 & 233,This product along with the double 223 really softens my dry hard hair. I highly recommend it for chemically processed hair.
3,Poor monitor's brightness,"It seems like 17"" monitors in HP laptops are significantly less bright than smaller monitors in HP laptops and even 17"" monitors in laptops of other brands (e.g., Sony). This has been confirmed by customers passing by and Compusa salesmen."
5,Andy's Finest Recording to Date,"This CD is an amalgamation of Andy Summers' talent as a musician and composer. No two tracks are alike; they all have unique sounds and textures which convey emotions and feelings that words cannot describe. A listening of this recording from beginning to end will take you through a muscial journey. Tracks to pay special attention to are ""Imagine You"", ""A Piece of Time"", ""Island of Silk"", ""Journey Through Blue Regions"", and ""Rainforest in Manhatten""."
3,Onan of nano?,"Several earlier reviewers have detailed themajor shortcomings of this book, so I defer any add-ons.Mr Atkinson is a name-dropper, heaping effusive praise on someresearchers & companies, while flogging other individuals or groups.He covers many aspects and potentials of nanotechnology, a goodpoint, but the (startup) companies he mentions have not set theworld on fire.He is not a linguist, or he & his editor would not muff simplestuff like ""und so weiter"" into ""und so unter""(p.168).There are a few technical glitches as well.Overall, I give it a ""3"" and worth the price of a magazine...that's what I paid off the remainder table."
4,A Piece of Paradise...only improvement is needed...,"This Cd from Sky is very close to ""a piece of paradise"", almost all the songs are beautiful and great to listen to. However, I hate to say this, but this album lacks variety. You can even mix the songs together to make up 1 song! If you're a person that needs variety and get sick of things easily(like me), think twice before you buy this CD! They're not as good as Savage Garden...but they're working hard! All the same, this CD is one of the best ever! Keep up the great work, Antoine and James!"
4,Ayn Rand of the 21st century,A fast paced novel in praise of capitalism. Like reading Atlas Shrugged in a mere 200 pages.
4,Great to Read on a Business Trip,"Action/Adventure mixed with a wild (but realistic) view of the future. If you like aviation, golf, technology, action and making obscene amounts of money, then you'll love this novel. A Michael Crichton / Tom Clancey-ish story, but packed into just 220 pages. Very entertaining, but with tons of technical meat. I was thoroughly entertained and got a bit smarter in the process. And you might just become the world's first Trillionaire."
3,Didn't hear it myself can't really review it,I bought this for another person. I really can't review it because I have not heard it. I bought it for someone who wanted it because they were familiar with it so I assume it is good.
4,Reliable trimmer,"Reliable item. We've had it two years and it is still going strong, holds a charge, and in our case is used primarily by a stroke survivor with dominant hand residual- husband is able to trim facial hair himself, as the handle, especially initially, is easy to hold."
3,Interesting storyline,"The storyline is very interesting but I found the writing to be a bit distracting. Lines like ""Suddenly, like a flame touching petroleum, the cramp consumed his entire muscle."" seem a bit over the top and other examples of this are all over the book. Interstingly enough I found his first novel, The Race, not to have this same style and consequently I thought it was a much better read."
3,Read The Race first - then wait two weeks,"Giving only a three star rating to The Tour may be colored by the fact that I read both of the Dave Shields books set during the Tour de France back to back. As a result, The Tour wasn't quite as fresh as it might have been if I had waited a couple of weeks to read it. The first book, The Race, is an exciting quick read (4 stars) about one stage in the Tour de France. The Tour isn't as tight as The Race but it's still a page turner. This isn't great literature but if you like to read, like bikes, like the Tour de France, you'll like The Tour. Each book stands on its own but if you plan to read both, it makes sense to read The Race first as The Tour takes up where The Race ends."
2,"Not as bad as The Race, but still a big mistake","Typical sophomore effort that displays A) some understanding of how little the writer knew in the previous book, and B) that a distinct effort was made to learn how to write. Not enough effort, however.The doping storyline is difficult to judge because it's so unbelievable. Some details ring true and some do not. A few more good details with a knowing touch (i.e., ""the chair is yellow"") would have sufficed.The bigger problem is the villian, who is basically Aaron from ""Titus Andronicus."" Motiveless malice taken too baby-eating extremes.In sum, typical pablum that makes you want your three hours back."
5,Gorgeous Watch!!,I recieved the Seiko Coutura Watch for Christmas and it is much more beautiful in person than on the web site. I have worn Seiko watches all my life and I am in my 40's. I have had only 3 other Seikos because they last so long and hold up so well. I replaced them only because I wanted a new style. This coutura line is unbelievable. I have been looking at a similiar watch by Rolex and of course it is thousands of dollars more expensive. I must say the Seiko is just as beautiful if not more gorgeous than the Rolex. I am so happy with my new Seiko! It is dressy yet casual enough to wear everyday and I will. I am sure I will be enjoying my Seiko Diamond Accented Courtura Watch for a very long time.
5,I love this watch!,"I just received this watch from my boyfriend last night as a suprise gift. I'm sneaking on the site to see what he paid for it and decided to write a review. It's exactly what I wanted, a little more bling than I thought I'd like, but now that I have it on I'm thinking just enough bling!"
1,WATCH DIAL IS TOO SMALL,"THIS WATCH LOOKS VERY NICE ON WEBSITE. BUT UNFORTUNATLEY I DIDN'T READY THE DETAILS AS CLOSE AS I SHOULD HAVE. I BOUGHT THIS WATCH THINKING IT WAS LIKE ONE I HAD SEEN FOR $550 IN KAY JEWELERS. THIS IS NOT THE SAME WATCH. IT IS MUCH SMALLER AND YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE THE GOLD ON THE BAND. IF YOU WANT A SMALL WATCH YOU MIGHT LIKE THIS ONE. FOR MYSELF I THINK IT LOOKS LIKE A ""BABY"" WATCH, FOR A YOUNG GIRL. I AM RETURNING AND BUYING A WATCH WITH A LARGER DIAL."
3,ok,"smaller than I expected, also gold tone very faint, more understated than pictures on web, still seiko are good watches my previous one proved to be great value for money, hope this is as good...."
3,not as good as the original,"I liked Peter Dayton, and owned the LP in the 80's. I thought that my tastes had changed when I listened to ""Stuck on the Same Refrain."" It was more vapid than I had recalled, but then I pulled out the old LP, and the original was much more dynamic. Too bad that they did not use the recordings that were originally released for the CD."
3,Where are the originals ???,"I've waited for a long time for these songs to make it to a cd.Unfortunately it's not the originals.Great music,disappointed that it's not the originals."
5,Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage CD,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE, IT IS VERY ROMANTIC, I FELT SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL WHEN I SAW IT THE FIRST TIME. THE MUSIC IS AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL."
3,Not playable on US DVD Players,"The concert is a great concert. Katie's a wonderful perfomer.My problem with this DVD is that is not NTSC as it is listed here on Amazon. It is a PAL format. Most computers can play the DVD, but not most DVD players. There are some players that will convert the format on the fly.I have notified Amazon customer service of this, and the modification they made to the information went from ""NTSC"" to ""Imported, NTSC.""The marketplace reseller only responds to email, and slowly at that. Their response to my inquiry about the format before I bought the DVD was that they had no access to the DVD to look at the box. I ordered and as soon as I opened the box and looked at the DVD box knew it was being returned. Amazon gave me a credit for the shipping. It took 2 months from when I shipped the DVD back to get a account credited notification from Amazon.So in summary, if you have a way to play a PAL DVD, this concert is great. If you can only play NTSC, don't order it."
5,Practical and Useful,"I'm the Training Coordinator at a manufacturing facility with 200 hourly employees whom we are trying to get more involved in a team-based work system. This book has given me so much PRACTICAL information on the how's and why's of doing this! I'm actually able to relate this information to our employees in a way that it clearly shows the benefits TO THEM of working in teams. Too many of these so-called ""Team Building"" books are filled with silly exercises that do nothing in the long run. If you want something practical and useful, I recomment this book!"
3,"Sad Macs, Bombs, and Other Disasters (4th Edition) (Sad Macs, Bombs...",This book was somewhat helpful when it came to figuring out my computer failures. As Apple developed more reliable machines it was not needed.
5,If you own and use a mac beyond sytem 7.1 buy this!!,"It is sad but, while system 6.0 was nuke proof, OS 7.5.x and up do tend to tip-over-and-go-crunch leaving you at a loss. An answer to about every mac disaster related question I have had (and I have had my share). It should ship with the new models..."
2,"Why doesn't it say 'Instrumental Only'? (I know, it says Solo Piano)","Should not have rushed to download it. I bought just one song from the Havana soundtrack that I liked, Hurricane Country and it wasn't the version from the movie with the vocals by the Brazilian guy. Without his vocals this song sucks.. Dave, why bother doing a vocal-less version of a song when most of your songs don't have vocals? Doh!"
5,Scrapbooking tips from an expert,This book lets me into the world of scrapbooking through a graphic designer's eye. Ali has many great ideas for wonderful layouts. I also love the themes she uses for her pages and she has inspired me to also take these special moments and capture them in my scrapbooking. Her journaling is wonderful and is shown to be a very intregral part of Ali's design of each page. I often go to this book as a begin a new page in my scrapbook. Thanks Ali!
1,Repetitive and Boring,"This book is such a waste of money. It's repetitive and boring. Every layout is followed by the same paragraphs: vision, communication, and additional ideas. It all seems ""copy and paste"", besides nothing in these layouts is impressive. It's like a compilation of the author's best friends scrapbook pages. I didn't like any single one of them, but even if I had, there were no real instructions to be found."
4,Get inspiration,"Ali Edwards is the queen of scrapbooking. Even if you have a different style, she inspires you to try new things, create art, tell a story and to preserve memories."
4,bulb,"delivery was fast, seemed a little pricey, but at least someone was out there to make it available"
3,Wayne Kramer & The Pink Fairies - 'Cocaine Blues' (Total Energy),"Try not to get too excited about the title.'Cocaine Blues' is a decent odds and sods collection of the ex-MC 5 guitarist's work. The first four tracks, ""If You're Goin' To The City"", Bob Seger's ""Heavy Music"", title cut ""Cocaine Blues"" and the MC 5 gem ""Kick Out The Jams"" were pulled from a gig Wayne played at Dingwalls in London in 1978. The Captain Trip label had put out a disc with the entire show. The remaining tunes on 'Cocaine Blues' are so-so studio pieces that Kramer cut that same year. Pretty much aimed toward big-time MC5 / Wayne Kramer fans."
5,YOU WANT EMOTION?!?!?!?,"This album is full of emotion. Lush keyboards, and strings. If you're looking for a heavy album, this doesn't really cover it. This album is a mix of Queensryche, Dream Theater and Marillion. The best tracks are Morning on Earth, Her Voices, King of Loss and The Perfect Element."
3,A BIG LETDOWN,"I have been a fan of Pain of Salvation for a while now. Entropia is my favortie album of all time, and that is saying a lot. The guys just seemed to hold back on the album. It isnt heavy at all, and im a progressive METAL fan. I bought the album with hopes of something spectacular and i was really dissapointed. Buy the first 2 albums if you are into bands like Vanden Plas and DT, but leave The Perfect Element on the shelf."
3,Mystery Novel,"In an era of archeological findings binging the exclusivity and accuracy of the canonical gospels into question, this book seemed to have it all - another account of a historical record exonerating the biggest villain of all time. Instead we get a poorly written quasi midcentury type British mystery story, complete with breathless alusions to future chapters. It again seems to be another New Yorker length article blown up to book length with repetitions and references to the obvious. It is interesting and fun, but you need to get past the poor writing to enjoy it."
3,thought i was getting something that i didnt,"well, i bought this hoping itd be an english translation. guess i shouldve paid more attention to the description (what little there was). ah well. it was an interesting read about how the lost book was found and the fun it was to translated it. the climax of the book comes when the author gives you the gist of what is actually in the text, supported with a few verses here and there. it was good for what it was, dont get me wrong. i just wanted something else when i bought it"
1,Disapointing,"The book is very poorly written, and properly edited, it would really be 50% thinner. You will learn very little about the content of the Gospel of Judas, but you won't be spared by quotes such as ""this has the potential to shake Christianity on its foundations"", which are really preposterous. You will also learn that Switzerland has mountains and the Nile flows in Egypt. Fans of academic bickering will find some material to enjoy."
3,"Written in haste, and incomplete","The Lost Gospel was obviously written in haste, and rushed into print without proper editing. The organization is poor; the text is repetitious; 50 pages -- rather than 300 -- would have sufficed. Moreover, the story of the manuscript's history and recovery is obviously incomplete. I suspect that a fuller and better written account will emerge -- eventually. Until that time, save your money."
3,"Interesting yes, but where was the editor?","This book is chock-full of information about an extremely important gospel. I think that together with the gospels of Thomas and Mary Magdalene, these books have revolutionized our understanding of Jesus, his teachings, and the community around him. Whether this will percolate down to our more cerebral churches, let alone to evangelicals, is quite a different matter.I do have a problem with the slow pace of the book, which reinforced my skimming skills. Enough already about the geography of Alexandria, the development of the banking industry in Switzerland, the exotic diet (baby pigeons ripped apart with the hands) and home furnishings of Egyptian manuscript dealers! Much of the text seems to pad out the tome to 300 pages. But I'm not sorry I bought it - it's just a lot of hors d'oeuvres before the wonderful main course comes."
3,"A book on how the Judas Gospel was found, researched, and published","If you are interested in learning about the wheeling and dealing that is part of this document's history, I recommend this book. If you're more interested in learning in detail about this gospel itself, you might want to try elsewhere.This book provides an excellent introduction by Bart Ehrman. It does not, however, contain a translation of the gnostic Gospel of Judas (much of it is paraphrased at the end).The bulk of the book describes how the gospel was found and how it was dealt with (both by the antiquities sellers and by scholars). You will learn a great deal about the Mideastern antiquities market--more than you will about gnosticism."
5,The future of crime thrillers,"What really makes this book stand out from all the others is its unique achievements of narrating a gripping tale, peppering it with fascinating nuggets of information, and illuminating it with well-turned prose. There are many page-turners on the market, but none with the same richness of detail and refinement of language. The author has evidently researched his subject thoroughly, and takes pleasure in sharing historical and cultural insights that makes you feel you are learning something at the same time as enjoying the read. And while Twining could simply have used the same turns of phrase that typically propel this type of story along, he constantly comes up with novel and arresting images that mark him out as a serious novelist in the making. Twining has raised the bar for all thriller writers, and it remains to be seen if he is the only one to meet the new standard when he releases his next book."
3,Possibilites,"I really wanted to love this book, the premise sounded great, and I had seen such great reviews. I have really mixed feelings. Ths story was good, interesting, but I just felt like I was reading a script with not a lot of detail or heart. I will try this author again, although I have to admit I may wait for paper next time. My apologies to the author, but it just didn't grab me."
4,a fine thriller and a very good debut!,"i really enjoyed the double eagle, looking forward to reading more of mr. twinning's books! this one was hard to put down!"
2,Struggled,"Struggled to get into this, really didn't grab me in anyway. Didn't like the characters or sometimes longwinded descriptions. Action thriller it is not!Two stars because I'm feeling generous, not entirely sure what planet the five star givers are on!There is far better out there."
4,"more time you put into this, the greater the results","i used this product in 75 degree weather and allowed it to sit in the sun for approx 2hrs. did a decent job. the following weekend i let it sit all day from about 8am to 5pm and the results were MUCH BETTER. although the cracks in my leather were still visible, the leather is much softer and looks richer than before. take your time when using this on your leather. does anyone know how i can fix the cracks in my seats?"
3,Cute romance,"Kenna Mallory has always been a maverick - cut off from her family when she decides to go to the college of her choice, she reluctantly comes back into the family fold for a high ranking position at the Mallory chain of luxury hotels. Her family is embarrassed by the jobs she `s chosen in the past, never seeming to realize that they were character building and that she managed to make it on her own. Teamed with sexy hotel VP Weston Roth, who thinks she's a spoiled debutante, she struggles to make her mark in the board room, while coping with a backstabbing cousin and her growing feelings for Wes, who's in competition with her for a promotion.While the story is cute, it is rather short, thus being pretty undeveloped and resolved a little too quickly. But in Shalvis' capable hands, what could have been mundane and cliched is actually a well written but average story."
5,Amazing,This therapy is amazing...A friend who studied this freed me from 35 years of smoking...I had never tried to stop...and it really works...I bought the book to review the process..and wish to study more...it has also helped me be less stressed and not become angry (like when someone cuts you off...etc). Believe!!
4,Great book and incredible therapy,"This is a grea book and therapy, I just think that it is incomplete it is missing the advanced therapy"
1,It didn't work for me either,I too read this book cover to cover with high hopes for success. I took notes and paid extra attention on how to perform each technique. When a particular therapy had more than one technique I tried the first with no improvement and worked my way onto the next and still I saw nothing. I got no immediate results as promised and no results still. I've been very disappointed with this book.
4,Tapping The healer Within,"Callahan has written a very useful book here. Tapping The Healer is fairly straight forward. He has cut back on much of the theory of Thought Field Therapy, and has instead focused on some very tangible techniques for helping ourselves to heal many things - stress, trauma, allergy symptoms, physical stressors, anger, depression, and many other limiting emotions. Although some of the text is redundant in its presentation of techniques, it does give detailed descriptions of tools for our use. It makes one want to learn more about this phenomenal Energy Psychology, about its uses and potential.Spirit Journeys: Freeing the Soul in this Life and Beyond,Healing Thoughts: Applying Therapeutic Shamanism in Your Daily Life"
1,Rubbish,"I feel embarrassed to write this review and even admit I purchased this modern day snake oil. Just think about your anxiety and tap away vigorously on your body and presto! you've just lined the pockets of this author. This idea of: ""Warning! You must have an Open Mind for it to work!"" means, simply, that it's impossible to disprove. After all, if it doesn't work for you, it's your fault. I suggest you research TFT online before sinking any money into this nonsense. It is Junk Science, pure and simple. For those who claim it works, well what can I say, placebo affect. Taking sugar pills and calling them 'anxiety reducers' also works wonders. That's the power of the brain, not some mystical and extraordinary discovery by Callahan. Good grief."
3,"Concept okay, but plodding book","Whether this works as the author claims, or whether it's one of those ""we don't know why it works, it just does"" (imho the more likely explanation) sort of things, it doesn't hurt to try the program, and you are only out the price of the book.That said, this book is very repetitive (it is about 50 pages too long) and plodding. It should have come with a CD of the instructions for each tapping sequence, which would make it much easier to use."
4,Much more than its title implies,"Genealogists in the U.S. who are descended from Loyalists who settled in Canada are usually aware that their Loyalist ancestors were granted land by the Crown. But few know that the grown children of those Loyalists could also apply for land grants (including daughters). This book lists those ""children"" who applied for land grants in Ontario, and copies of the applications can then be obtained from the Ontario Archives. Descendants should indeed obtain copies, to increase their knowledge of the family. As an example, in my own case, the index revealed an older married daughter's name who had previously only been known as a census figure; the second married name of another daughter who had married twice; and, copies of the actual applications (when obtained) included the signature of my Loyalist ancestor as a witness to a son's land application. I recommend this book for general genealogical library collections."
5,Great book!!,I think this was a very funny and interesting book. I had to keep on reading it because it was getting so good.
5,Thanks For The Memories!,"Boy, this one really brings back the memories! But it also gives one pause for reflection on what real martial arts training is all about.A wonderful book. I've already read through my copy several times..."
3,Thought it was the actual novel,This was only a script of the directors and others discussing the movie..I wanted the novel. Overall it was ok just wanted more 100pages I read it an afternoon
1,Never order from NAPASTYLE,"If you want to receive substandard products at high prices with NO customer support, please purchae from Napa Style. The products I received were shipped to the wrong address, were not representative of the items I received and it is impossible to get any service over the phone. There was no packing slip enclosed or information on how to return the items. THere was a slip included in the shipment that the product may contain lead or cadmium (both poisonous). All in all, the WORST online shopping experience I have ever had. And they wont refund shipping."
2,"Gone for Good, and good riddance","Unfortunately, this book seems to be written with an eye toward Hollywood, not the reader. The author fails to create truly engaging characters, as he has in the past. Still, the book has some interesting angles. After the first few chapters, though, this reader was merely going through the motions, wishing this book would end. Easily the most insubstantial effort from one of the best literary creators around."
3,Waaaaaay Gone,"I have read all of Mark Childress's books, and frankly I was disappointed. I know this was a fictional novel, but an invisible man? A flying man? The book was, however, a fun read and I enjoyed finding all the notorious and famous people that inhabited the island. I was also glad to know that Marilyn Monroe still looked great in her late 40s. It gives me hope."
2,As magical as a magician at a 5 year olds birthday party,"This book had the makings of being great, but turned into a fragmented disassociative bit of nonsense. It is a shame too, because if anyone should have been able to pull off ""magic"", Mark Childress should have. A real disappointment."
5,Looking for the old exchange WW diet,This book is great. It really spells out everything and makes it simple! It has meal suggestions and realistic recipes for everyones tastes
3,Weight Watchers Quick Success Program Cookbook,Book I had before and needed to replace it. The content is excellent. The quality of the book itself was not great.
4,Great Care Bear Cookies,"This item was great not only did my order arrive sooner than I expected the item itself was great, the taste of the cookie was delicious all the children at my daughters birthday party loved them."
5,the desert virgen,this was the missin link to her trilogy...the knight brothers trilogy was the best i ever read.......pls make another set...awesome stories!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,WHAT?????,"DUDE? Zachery! Please read Joshua Payne's bio. Groban has never been on an opera stage. Payne has years of singing on Groban who is still a child. Groban is good, yes, but I saw Joshua Payne recently in concert and he performed some of his old opera repertoire in the middle of his show. He blew us away with one of the most commanding opera voices i have ever heard. Groban can't touch this man's ability. Joshua is an unreal songwriter/guitar player/pianist/pop singer/opera singer/folk singer who can do whatever he wants with his voice. Groban sings one way all the time which can be very nice. Still, the soft singing that Joshua Payne has mastered takes much more control and the loud singing is mind boggling. Zac, he has a masters in Opera. Tell you what, please do your homework next time before you go slamming one facet of this dynamic multitalented wonder. And from all of us who love Joshua Payne, you are forgiven."
3,"You want slow & easy, this is it","If you are ready to turn out the lights and cuddle, this might set the mood with a male vocalist. Otherwise it will probably send you right to sleep. Think ""White Christmas"" style. Not a single song on the CD is what I consider upbeat."
5,Bliss,"Joshua Payne has a voice that's effortless in delivery. This particular collection of songs is wonderful. I expect to hear great things from him in the future.He's refreshing and calming to listen to. Almost an Irish tenor, clear and clean vibrato; sensitive and sensual....ITS GREAT DANCE-IN-THE-DARK-WITH-YOUR-SWEETIE music!"
4,Joshua Payne at his best,This is a very romantic and mellow CD with a wonderful rich voice by Joshua Payne. He has a great voice with a great range. If you like soft easy listening vocals this is the CD for you. He is a very exciting singer and a fresh and vibrant new singer. Highly recommended. Four to five stars.
5,Where's the 2nd album!,Joshua Payne is a true artist.Where is the 2nd album? This man should be touring the globe giving joy to millions all over the world! Whenever I listen to his CD I invariably get tears in my eyes! BEAUTIFUL! Thank you Joshua!
5,...more than you know....,"You need this CD in your collection.....more than you know! Your Love, My Home will take you to another place.....away from your worries and stresses. Joshua's voice will lift your spirits....you will be encouraged, comforted, and challenged. The warmth & passion of each song will wrap around you like a blanket on a cold day...or the arms of your special someone holding you close. The ""realness"" you hear is the real deal! He is as he sings ...passionate...caring... loving....REAL! This CD will not just be a special edition to your collection....it will become the gift you give to your friends, family, and loved ones!"
3,Pleasant enough,"Joshua Payne has a lovely voice. He gives every song the same treatment regardless. The positive side is that you hear every word of songs you have sung along to before, and very relaxing. The kind of music one would enjoy while at a romantic dinner in a restaurant. I gave this CD a 3 purely because Joshua Payne, with lovely voice and all, did not set my heart on fire."
3,not Josh Groban but good,"Mr. Payne obviously has a voice and a talent that is strictly his own so do this very good singer a favor and quit comparing him to the excellent singer Josh Groban. The 2 just cannot be compared and the comparison will work against Joshua Payne. Joshua Payne's voice is very good but smaller and thinner, his music is much simpler and for me not interesting enough or different enough from other artists to cause me to be a fan. Hope you live through the comparisons and find your niche Mr. Payne. Russell Watson singing pop is a better comparison even though Watson is a tenor."
4,Young talent that needs more grooming and attention,"Joshua Payne is a great young talent, who possesses a wonderful unique voice, but I could not help but notice some sadness in that enchanting voice.Nice Music, nice words, but all the songs have the same style. I expect more success from future albums, if he gets more support and attention."
3,Nice Voice But Nothing Special,"I actually purchased this CD which was a radio promo copy days before the official release of today. I am a big Josh Groban fan so I thought Joshua Payne might be similar in style. NOT! Joshua has a nice rich melodic voice but I was not too keen on the choice of songs including the 70's tune ""If"" by Bread. I think in time Joshua will continue to improve and hopefully not re-record songs that have already been done to death."
3,Room for Improvement,"This CD is not too bad. But there is very little variety on it. I am totally satisfied with my order of it, as I know it is a cd I'll listen to again, but I fear it will be relegated to the ""good background music"" portion of my collection. I was expecting to find a new artist who I'd enjoy driving around singing along with in the car. Instead I have a talented future superstar who is able to use his musical prowess to lull me to sleep."
1,Cheesy and kinda boring,He has a nice voice. Very pleasant. But the music was cheesy and boring. Sorry but it just wasn't very enjoyable.
2,Hmm sounds familiar,"When I first heard a track from this song.. I thought it was Josh Groban. Turns out it isn't though.. but someone just the same. All of payne's songs seem to have the same flow, music, and no variety at all. All though his voice isn't bad and he can play piano, he still seems like a rip off of Josh Groban. I gladly stand behind this when I say it Josh Groban is still better."
1,"Joshua ""Wanna be Groban"" Payne?","Joshua Payne is trying very hard to be Josh Groban or Russel Watson. I feel that he had been trying very hard to sing those songs, and he cannot brought out the actual meaning where the songs were original being composed. For example ""If You Leave Me Now"" give me an impression that Joshua Payne trying to sing it this way ""Oh yeah baby? You wanna breakup? I am gonna cut you into pieces!"" That is not suppose to be a song of joy but Joshua had sang it this way.Joshua Payne have a long way to go to be able to compete with Josh Groban, which is good, at least he got space to improve himself.Shall I recommend others to buy this CD? Only if you are not a fan of Russell Watson or Josh Groban and yes you may consider buying it."
1,Josh Groban: NOT!,"I purchased this CD on the recommendation of Amazon.Com. Big mistake! I listened over and over, trying to see where this man's voice would grab me and take me away from my daily living for just one minute.... Joshua Payne will never been a Josh Groban; he can't even compete in the same music arena. So, folks, if you are really into Josh Groban (I have every thing Mr. Groban has released and WANT MORE), do not, I repeat, do not purchase this CD. A complete waste of good money!"
5,The Mills Brothers make these hymns sparkle,"This CD contians ten hymns by The Mills Brothers, all of them absolutely wonderful. However, I would like to single out two of the tracks as being the best versions of the respective songs that I have ever heard. ""The Old Rugged Cross"" is both aristically brilliant and spiritually inspiring. The arrangement is perfect for the song and the style of The Mills Brothers. The same goes for their amazing version of ""Just a Closer Walk With Thee"", which is not done in the typical overpaced style that the song is usually performed in, but is slowed down so that the power of the lyric comes through perfectly. These two and the other eight songs make for a terrifically inspiring time of worship."
3,GOOD BOOK FOR CHRISTIAN VIEW,We just a seminar & discussion about this book!Good and solid thought that we learn that hospitality & violence are exist and something that must be understood from the Logos point of view.Reading this book will equipped Christian to stand tall on the ground in Post-Modernism Era.God bless.
2,Not so hot!,"I confess that I did not watch the entire movie because, in spite of what it says on the box, it was not a widescreen transfer. It was, instead, pan and scan. Shame on VCI."
3,A weak McGuffin !,"This film had good actors and good direction, and it was worth whatI spent on the DVD. However I was disappointed by the weakMcGuffin.That is the term invented by Alfred Hitchcock for the key ingredient inthe plot that everyone is chasing -- the jewels, the microfilm, thebeautiful princess or whatever. In this case the McGuffin was therather obvious fact that under hot and humid conditions the air is lessdense and therefore a higher speed is needed to take off a plane. It isalmost incredible that all those talented designers and skilled pilots did notfind the McGuffin until the final scene."
5,Can't live w/out this stuff!!!,"It is a BAD day in my house if I run out of this! I use it on my curly hair when I get out of the shower as well as my daughter. It always leaves a nice shiny, silky, and tagle free head of hair. I have recommended this so so many people and they are hooked too... We call it our hair crack... I searched everywhere for a place that carries it and I have only been able to purchase this item online."
4,Excellent leave-in,"This is a great product for use as a leave-in treatment after washing and conditioning hair. It seems to also have a detangling quality and leaves hair smooth, easier to manage during styling, and helps the cuticle to appear smoother after hair has dried or is styled."
1,will not buy again!,"I am really upset with my order. I purchased 3 bottles of this product because I loved the smell and the way it worked on my hair (mainly the smell), However when I received it I opened the bottle just to smell it and it was not the same. Then I realized the product is not FERMODYL INTERACTIVES anymore it is ROUX. How dare they sell a product on line that looks like what I always ordered and then get it and it is from another company. (without any notice). I am really annoyed and pissed that they can do this. I will never buy from them again!!!"
4,Wooden ship insight,"This book is a great look into the world of a man's passion for wooden boats and ships. His obvious love of the traditional world of wooden vessels makes for great reading. Mr. Rosborough is brutally honest throughout, including describing his own less-than-glorious moments. His narrative is fast paced and rivetting. As the third owner of one of his boats, it's also fascinating to read of the first owner, and a little about the vessel, MEGAN D. A must read for those interested in traditional wooden boatbuilding, and those who share a passion for traditional boats."
3,Recruits,"An interesting show and the best part is Suzy ""Sweet Kicks"" Sanderson's turns at the very beginning, if you luck into one of the first-cut copies. Don't let the smiley face fool you, though. :)"
5,Great skirt,"The skirts we bought were a great fit, a bargain and arrived in time for Christmas. Thank you!"
3,Studio work is better,"Hard as it is to believe, ""Energized"" is anything but. I own Higher Power and Storms of Life and recommend both highly. Energized contains stuff from the other two CDs but is vastly inferior. As with a lot of live performances the band members are given a lot of time to solo to the point where the listener who is not there gets bored. Don't buy this one. Buy the other two instead."
2,"Great idea, but not well made, sizing runs small.","Maybe I just got a bad one, but the one I bought wasn't put together straight. When I lined the bottom up correctly, the top fell crooked, and visa versa. After trying it on, and struggling with it, I finally threw it in my lingerie drawer where it has stayed. I never wore it because I couldn't get it all on straight. I also think that the sizing is small. I usually get a size up from the recommended size, and even with that this piece was too small. So keep in mind that the sizing chart is about 2 sizes off on the small side. (I am one of those who buy online all the time, and DO get out the measuring tape and measure myself when necessary. The sizing was off according the the measurements given.)"
1,Poor plans,"Most of the plans in this book are completely unintelligible. Avoid this one, there are MUCH better books out there."
5,Must have book,"If you are a student of history, or a Civil War buff or have an interest in Charleston, then this is the book you have been waiting for.Very precise and detailed, Dr. Wise writes with a style that makes one believe they are reading a novel rather than a historical account. He brings life to the participants and explains the struggles from both sides.Too often writers of CW histories either interject their own predjuces or romantasize the events all out of porportion. In this book the author does neither.The ability to clearly explain the often chaotic events in an easy to understand manner is worth the price of the book alone. I would rate this with the best of works on the CW."
4,gate of hell,Only reason for four stars is that book came with no dust jacket when it said it did. Not that big of a deal. I am pleased with the prompt arrival of the book and its condition.
4,"If you thought Great Big Boy was weird, get a load of this!","Well, being the first reviewer, I will break the ice: this is not 6 and 12 string guitar. It is something far beyond quirky. In fact, it shoots so far beyond his previous borders, that you may be dissolusioned. Don't be. This album is layered with brilliant music, twisted guitar lines, unique melodies, and an overall powerful impression. Plus, look at the price.Many people don't care for this CD: critics, Kottke's manager, and even Kottke's wife. But the man himself loves it. And so do I."
2,Whitehorn,Waffled on and on. Did not find it interesting at all.Left a lot to be desired.Had to work to finish it. Boring.
5,GREAT READ,Another one of Bryce Courtney's books that I would highly recommend. This would make anyone a believer in justice for all.
3,Power of 1: 2,"Whilst I enjoyed it because of the humour, innocence and the realness of what actually happened in SA at the time it was predictable and the storyline the same as Power of 1. Still enjoyed it as it was a quick, in between other books, read. Suffice to read whilst on a short holiday."
2,Power of One revisited,"Let me start by saying that I really enjoyed the Power of One and Tandia. Whitehorn is a real disappointment because it is the same characters, material and storyline rehashed with, at times, ludicrous similarity. Like one of the other reviewers, I almost gave up when Tom went to ""discover himself"" in the copper mines of Northern Rhodesia. If you've not read the Power of One, you may enjoy this book. If you have read the Power of One, I suspect, like me, you'll feel cheated. The strong feeling you get is of a good and successful author who is running out of ideas but is under pressure from his publisher to produce."
3,insiring,yes this book is insiring and uplifting but I can't help but notice the arrogance of this man. When did he go back and help or thank the people who have been of assistance to him??? Without others help would he be where he is now?! Yes read and enjoy this book but remember how important it is to show appreciation for those who give you assistance along the road of life!!!
3,A good introductory work.,"This work attempts to trace the key role of astrology in Western intellectual life, but Peter Whitfield does not incorporate all ancient, classical, medieval, and modern sources as well as Dr. Lester Ness' recent study. Like, ""Written in the Stars"", it does however show that Western astrology evolved in different cultures and adapted to differing belief systems."

3,To sweet!,I've tried this powder and to me it's just to sweet! I'm suppose to mix it with a beverage which I did but It's still just to sweet and I did'nt notice a difference in how I felt either. Kinda a waste of money if you ask me.
3,Pats Opinion,"I took the whole bottle. It took the tang out of my juice with it's sweetness :) ,but I really could not tell any difference other than that. Of course I am 78 yrs old and not much helps any more."
2,Cheap,"The quality of paper is really bad, its so thin that you can almost see through it and they mail it in a cardboard box but not in a crush resistant canister. My packaged was crushed and the thin poster--which actually was more like a piece of paper had countless creases and wrinkles that I could not get out. Even if the package had not been crushed, I would have been disappointed because of the cheap, cheap quality and weight of the paper. The company should consider listing the weight of the paper or some way to indicate the quality of poster."
5,Don't settle for anything else,"I purchased this set for my husband, and after using it for the first time this weekend we will never try anything else! The results are amazing. He used it on the upholstery of his two-year-old Infiniti and the seats are now like new. Or better than new. It even restored the new leather smell.It also worked wonders on a leather jacket that he's had for a few years.This is hands down the best leather care product line available. Don't be turned off by the price - it is worth every penny."
3,So-so results,Used it once on my 2000 BMW's seats that hadn't been cleaned in years. I didn't get the amazing results I had been expecting based on the other reviews I have seen. The seats were definitely cleaner than before but the cracks still have dirt in them. I'll try again and update my review if things change.
4,Digital Image Suite,"While not offering nearly the tools as Photoshop,Digital Image Suite is the best of the lower-priced photo editing programs."
1,False Advertising,"I'm not a professional photographer or even an advanced amateur. However, I do have a Nikon D50 and like to do more than the typical ""point and shoot"" photos. So when I was shopping for a photo program I looked mainly at Microsoft Digital Image Suite and Photoshop Elements. In the product features for Digital Image Suite it specifically states: ""Supports RAW files..."".Well guess what, it supports only a limited list of RAW files. MS Support staff tells me that the D50 is not supported. In fact, I don't think any Nikon digital SLRs are supported.Unfortunately, I found this out after the 45 day guarantee expired. Kind of hard to explore all software features in 45 days.Wished I would have bought Photoshop Elements. They have much better support for a wide range of cameras and RAW file formats."
5,Simply the Best,"My husband and I are avid, amateur photographers and really like this photo-editing program. With just a few clicks you can erase any ugly additions that you don't want in your photos. You can correct the color balance, contrast any many other enhancements to your pictures.You can also share your photos with your email friends at a size that doesn't take forever to download when you are on a dial-up connection.This is the best program that we have used since we started using a digital camera in early 1999! We are now on our third digital camera and I don't think we will ever find a better editor for our pictures than this program. It is ""the best"" we have ever tried."
5,Excellant Software,This is excellant software. Definately worth the money. It was incredibly simple to install and understand. There is even a way to make the most mundane pictures look like awesome works of art. You can also make cards and letters and calendars and lots of other things to send to friends and loved ones. This software did everything I expected it to do and much more.
5,Every Thing you Need,This software has everything you need to edit photographs. I use it for work and at home.
4,Pretty Good,"I don't have any experience with Adobe, so I can't compare. I previously have used Microsoft Picture It software. The maunual setings on Picture it were terrible and I was forced to do everything manually, it was very hard. This newer version is much easier to use. I am very happy I upgraded. The only thing I wish it could do is read Nikon's NEF files without me having to convert them to JPEG."
5,GREAT PROGRAM FOR DIGITAL PHOTOS,"IF YOU TAKE DIGITAL PHOTOS for most people, the photo you took needs a little work or touch up. NO PROBLEM WITH THIS PROGRAM.This program can fix your photos + add a lot of extras to it too.Don't be fooled because this is not ADOBE nor can it do a lot of this the Adobe CS2 can do, but at the same time your not paying $500 to $12000 for this program either. For the average price of around $100 you get a good program.If your not sure or want to look around, go to www.ulead.com & try soome of thier programs for free!To bad MS doesn't offer this service, but with MS DIP or Ulead, you can't go bad with your money.Good Programs all the way for the purchase."
4,Orange County Holds The Finest Of All Of S. California,"The book has everything you will need to enjoy and explore this county with the nice Mediterranean climate.The book includes:Festivals and special attractionsFine art, crafts and entertainmentMuseums and historical sitesRestaurants and lodgingMalls and unique shopsOutdoor sports and recreationParks, natural preserves and wildlife viewing"
4,An expert examines possible causes of violent human behavior.,"This book carefully examines several violent convicts for the signs of factors that explain their violence. Rather than merely consigning them to labels such as sociopath, etc., the author demonstrates convincingly that the convergence of frontal lobe dysfunction (whether by trauma or disease) and childhood abuse fairly guarantees that the subject examinee will continue violently to offend. I found the book a valuable addition to my library of psychopathic manifestations of all sorts, violence or otherwise.Combining this book with the ease with which AMAZON allows me to buy books of any topic constitutes this purchase as among the most conveniently obtained books, in price and time and effort spent in acquisition, in my private library of several thousand volumes."
3,Bought this for school only,I would not have bought this book if it was not a required textbook for a college class. I never read the full book
1,not doing anything,"I have been applying this cream 3+ times a day for about 3 weeks now and haven't yet seen any results. I realize that natural remedies take longer than allopathic treatments but still, I would have hoped to see some change so far. I would not recommend you buy this unless you have testimonial from someone who it worked for. At $20 per bottle, it is too expensive of a trial and error."
5,Wonderfully entertaining--great for phonemic awareness!,"This book is fun and educational! The rhyming prose is delightful and has wonderful pictures accompanying each letter of the alphabet. There are lots of objects in each picture that begin with the letter (except X and Z, but really, can you think of many items that start with those letters?)"
4,CD review,THis cd is great! It has many flavors and feels to it and the listener will enjoy the varied sounds!
5,Perfect for young problem solvers!,Ravensburger puzzles are the best and my 4 yr old really gets good use out of this one. The pieces fit together well and are sturdy. The image and shape fits are challenging but not to the point of frustration. We bought this puzzle more than a year ago and it's still the first one out during puzzle time!
1,Never received item.,I hope the person who cheated me got in big trouble for this. I have to be careful in what I order for Amazon.
3,Really cooool,This is a really cool notebook or laptop because it is cheap (for a laptop)and it also is a good quality laptop.
4,not a bad machine at all,"The Compaq Armada that I got surplus from my dad's work 2 years ago has been more than useful to me. Dependable, easy to use, a great desktop replacement laptop. The only reason I say this is because of it's weight. But, as a hefty college freshman, I have no trouble transporting it to my classes. If you want a good college work notebook, the Armada is the one, but make sure you get an extra battery and network card."
5,psychoanalysis and film,"I have read Dr. Greenberg's books (this one and ""The Movies On Your Mind"") many times over many years. They are unparalleled. Despite (but really because of) the intense analysis you enjoy the films even more when you see them again."
2,Check for missing parts,"I bought the small size of this table about one month ago and placed it on my patio but have not actually used it yet. While cleaning my patio, I noticed that a plastic cover for one of the bolts had fallen off. As I replaced it, I noticed that another bolt had never been covered at all. Now it seems very obvious as it is a shiny brass color in contract with the black mesh table."
3,just ok,"The poster is the exact gift I was looking for, but the print and frame look cheap. The poster print doesn't extend to the corners of the frame; rather, the print was made with odd borders- latger on the top and thinner on the sides, so it looks somewhat silly in the frame. I think the recipient that I purchased it for will like it, just the same, so I'm keeping it."
5,A Concise Pentecostal Theology,"Contained within this well organized volume is the core of Pentecostal theology and a must read for anyone who seeks to better understand pentecostalism. Each of the sixteen doctrines, supported sufficiently with scripture, is presented within a theological framework . An example of such a framework, for the doctrine The One True God, would be the classical arguements given since medieval days for the existence of God (chapter 2). A nice plus is found at the end of each chapter where the authors have provided study questions to help insure the reader's comprehension of the material. Menzies and Horton have created a work that serves two purposes: first, as a resource for general theological knowledge; and, second, as a specific doctrinal reference for the Assemblies of God. Thus ""Bible Doctrines - A Pentecostal Perspective"" is an excellent addition to the library of the serious Bible student."
3,not everything I expected,"The description said nothing about markings in the book so I was disappointed by that, but it was delivered in a timely manner. In the future I just need to look for more specific words in the description."
1,Terrible shoe,Ordered a size 9 and I couldn't even place my foot inside of it.felt like it was a size 7. A waste of time and money. The makerEllie makes shoes for dolls not real people. Frustrating to buy shoes online.I returned the shoe for a full refund but had to pay shipping back so lost money.
3,Jogalite,"The product works great, but the problem comes when you have to change out batteries...it is expensive since they are not of normal AAA or AA sizes."
2,Poor clip design,"I purchased this item for night time jogging in my neighborhood. The main problem is that the clip design is not very easy to use. I had hoped to clip it to the back of my shirt, but it keeps falling off. I do like the brightness and the strobe patterns, but it is a little pricey for such a cheap clip design."
3,OK,The light is not very bright. For daylight riding you need more lumens than this offers. Nighttime riding is better.
5,What a Great Ladder!,"The 74"" aluminum ladder really fits the bill. My 5'3"" height makes it impossible to reach the top shelves in my kitchen with 9 foot ceilings. Its light weight makes it easy to carry anywhere I need it. It's really great!Jackie Quinn"
2,The same song over and over again,"Chris Rea has a deep, smooth and good voice. The songs can be described as slow blues, but not in the Robert Johnson way. But there's a big problem, and that is regarding the quality of the songs as well as the originality. Chris Rea is getting very boring to say the least, with these very slow numbers that lack melody. It's almost impossible to separate one from the other since they all sound more or less the same. If you have sleeping problems, this might be the solution. My advise is that you check out Omar & The Howlers instead - that would most certainly be a better choice."
3,So VERY loud!!,"This toy is excrutiatingly loud, so much so that we finally had to put a piece of packing tape over the speaker just to make the volume tolerable (which, judging by the other reviews, seems to be the solution of choice for the loudness issue). In retrospect I think I would've purchased a Plain Jane stacker instead."
3,Not that great.,"My daughter got the stacker when she was 5 months old. She is one year old now. She has stacked the animals on the pole only a few times. She pretty much just chews on the animals.It's hard for her to take them on and off. The pole seems a bit dangerous to me. It's hard and she fell on it once and hurt herself. The music is loud, though she never plays with the pole so it doesn't really matter.She does, however, love the cheap plastic rings that have been around forever. She can take them off and on. She chews on the rings and carries them everywhere. They are all over the house!"
2,Surprisingly Annoying,"I love several Baby Einstein toys, yet this one wasdisappointing. It is VERY loud. As another reviewerstated, it seemed to go on and on by itself. When itis turned off while in the middle of making musicit makes some fuzzy noise that can only stop on itsown. My 11 month old likes the music and sounds, butbecause of it's noise level I find myself hiding it."
3,Fun but LOUD!,"Don't get me wrong-I like the toy and so does my 7 month old son. It is cute, colorful and he loves pulling the pieces off (and for Mom to put them back). However, it is so loud! I'm not concerned for my self (I hear baby music all day long anyway) but because my baby is so close to it! I taped some cotton pads over the area that the sound comes from and now it is better. I'm not sure why they would make this toy so loud since it is for smaller kids. We like it anyway and Ryan plays with it everday and squeels with delight!"
1,Maybe should be recalled...,"My son received this toy for Christmas when he was 6 months old. He loves to chew on the animal rings and still does. BUT the pole is the perfect size to fit in his mouth. When he was learning how to sit on his own, I took the pole away from him. I saw him sitting there with it in his mouth and envisioned him falling and having it be jammed down is throat (Gross, I know.) Thinking I was being paranoid, I kept my feelings to myself. I reintroduced the toy to him a few weeks later when he was better at sitting. I left him to play with the toy under my husband's supervision. To my surprise when I came back into the room, the pole was on the dining room table. When I questioned my husband he said ""He could jam that thing down his throat. I don't think it's safe."" So, 2 parents at 2 different times thought the same thing. It's up to you if you want to buy it. Oh yeah- it is loud too and there is no volume control."
2,Not really impressed with this in spite of previous reviews,"I bought this for my 9 month old for the holidays. The noises I guess are cute and I thought it would be nice that she could put them in any order - which is the case except for the top animal, it has a 'head' so it always have to be put on top. Also, the rings are made to fit exactly on the pole with no room for 'really close'. A baby has to hold the the ring in her hand horizontally, and place it right down on the pole. I really would not recommend this for a baby with so many other products out there that is more 'baby friendly'. It definitely was not worth the money paid, regardless of the brand name."
3,Why so hard? Why so loud?,"This toy has two major flaws:1 - it is too loud and there is no way to control or adjust the volume.2- the stacking pole is hard plastic - the toy would be safer if it were flexible or at least cushioned.My daughter (9 months)does like this toy though and she enjoys pulling off the animals and chewing on them. Because I think it's too loud and stiff, I let her play with it while I'm playing too."
1,Disappointed...,"Based on other reviews, and other Baby Einstein products, I ordered this for my 7 month old for Christmas. The animals are cute, as are the funny noises, but other drawbacks offset this, in my opinion. It plays the same song LOUDLY over and over again when you put a piece on. Also, I was very surprised to discover that it is baby-powder scented - and strongly so. Perhaps some people may like this, but to me it smelled like a Pampers diaper does when it gets wet... Before I realized it was scented, I actually checked my daughter's diaper, thinking she needed to be changed!I will be returning this one, and sticking with the old, classic ring stacker, which she loves..."
5,Beautiful high quality watch!,"This is a high quality, sleek looking watch that will surely get you some compliments. It has all the features that many expensive watches have at a fraction of the price. Tissot (the lower end brand of Omega) is famous for high quality (they make the mechanisms for Swiss Army) and affordable prices. I am very pleased with my purchase and will definitely repurchase again when mine is worn out!"
4,"good book, interesting plot","This book has a good basic plotline. I don't know enough about genetics to comment on whether the science behind it is plausible, but that didn't matter so much to me. The story was good, built up some suspense to the end and included a couple of twists at the end. The plot is not overly involved or complicated, making it a fairly easy read. If the plot had been more complex it would have gotten a 5 star rating from me. This is just a plain good read, nothing spectacular, but very entertaining."
1,"Boring, uninspired, insipid","Pretty bad, just sort of stupid, not that compelling, and no interesting field of knowledge that goes with it."
5,a moment of history,"""God Doesnt Make Trash"" is a masterpiece. It isn't just about AIDS, it's about humanity, about a heterosexual woman who finds herself in the middle of the AIDS holocaust and records the truth. I think I'd like to see this book in a film. It's like Philadelophia Story with a fresh approach.Bill Bowker-SF"
4,RollerCoaster ride that ends on the down side,"Best legal thriller I've read in quite a long time. Smart, snappy, funny. But the plaintiff was way too flaky, didn't jibe. And the ending was so unfair it made me mad which in turn ruined the book for me. CAN A JUDGE DO THAT!!? Kerr leaves you hanging with another injustice and the case unresolved."
3,Stertches one's imagination,"This book had a lot of potential, a legal thriller about a woman dying of cancer because of medical malpractice. The characters are interesting, and the legal maneuvering believable, but the plot is very convulated and implausible. There are too many different stories being told at the same time. The cancer patient not only is facing death but is, and apparently has always been, something of a ding-a-ling. She has an almost ex-husband who is violent and unhinged. The hero, a lawyer who gets hooked by the case, has Viet Nam flashbacks. The villain, a family practice physician, is evil personified. All of this just strained my credulity but, for a first fiction effort, it was certainly acceptable. I'll not look for more of this author's books."
3,Will it end?,"The writer does a great job with the story, keeps you interested, lots of good words, but he should have put down the thesaurus and spent some time on bringing the story to an end. It left me hanging."
3,Good first effort,"Harmful intent was a good first effort by Baine Kerr, but it failed to really keep my attention and the plot seemed to move too slow at times. It seemed like there were too many flashbacks to the lawyer Peter Moss' time in Vietnam and too many loose ends not tied up in the end. I felt like I was left hanging at the end of the book."
2,"Good plot, poorly written.","I will give the author credit for writing a story compelling enough that I did not abandon it after 100 pages, however I found the writing style rather difficult to take. One example is the author's use of brand names for inanimate objects: ""He looked through the Levelor's"" rather than ""He looked through the binds."" This becomes as irritating in text form as it would if someone you met in real life spoke that way. Dialog is also not the author's strong suit. The victim in the story was supposed to be tough as nail and spoke in one liner and quips to demonstrate that. As a result, most of her dialog was difficult to follow. After page 200 I was in major skim mode, focusing only on text related to the outcome of the lawsuit."
3,"Good lookin, but didn't sound great","I've bought a sony stereo before and loved it. This one looks really sharp but the sound just didn't sound good. It was kind of hollow and hissy. Nothing sounded as good as it should. So I ended up spending more to get a much better sound. It really failed at higher volumes especially, although even low ones weren't right."
2,Horrible interface,"The sound in this system is good but the instructions for setting the clock didn't work, in fact, the instructions for setting the clock and for setting the alarm were exatly the same. The only way to get it to work was to pull the plug, restart it and set the time. I'm still not sure how to get it to set the alarm"
2,Not really a fan,"I smelled the body spray version of this at CVS but when I got it in the mail, I can't say I was a fan. It's not horrible, but it's not the first perfume I reach for. I just use it to maybe spray a shirt or something I don't really pay much attention to, but yeah.. Not recommended for anyone in their college years."
3,My husband likes it...,I'm not really a big fan of this perfume. The only reason I got it is bc my husband really likes it on me.
1,Fake Fake Fake,i honestly thought tis was a great deal since one of my girlfriends wears it and its smelled fantastic the bottle looks authentic but wen i sprayed nope not even a touch of similarity it honestly smells cheap its fake so beware just dont waste ur money on this or any other fragrances they all might be fake unless u get lucky and get the real thing
2,Not that great!,"I received this parfume last week, but I'm not that excited. The fragrance is common, it doesn't last and it doesn't make an impression."
4,Infectiously cheerful!,"A collection of favorites that were previously released on Yanni's many earlier albums, ""In Celebration of Life"" features mostly high-energy selections. The exuberant, beat-filled compositions are both motivating and uplifting. There is also an innocent, wonder-filled joie de vivre about this music that can release one's inner child. This compilation album, and also another similar one--""Reflections of Passion""--are great introductions to Yanni's multi-layered synthesizer music. Try also his recent release, ""Ethnicity"", for more of his upbeat celebrations of life."
2,Small belt,Be sure of your waistline dimensions when you order this item. The length of the belt should be disclosed so those with mature figures don't order something that has to be worn around the neck.
2,Weird design -- can't access volume buttons,"Ok, I bought this for jogging with my Sony Atrac CD player, and it works ok as far as just keeping the player from bouncing around too much or falling out. Other than that, though . . . bleh.The look of the case isn't all that great, but I can live with that. The real problem I have with it is that you can't get to the volume buttons when the player's in the case, and you can't pull it out of the case without unplugging the headphones. Sure, you can preset the controls, but if you're jogging or exercising and find the volume on a particular song too loud, you're pretty much stuck with it. It really makes me wonder if they couldn't have done something different there. Maybe put the headphone slit a little further forward a bit or make a flap or something so you can get to the volume buttons?I'm not terribly happy with it, but I can't find another case that would work better. If anyone knows of one, can you post it in your review or something? Thanks."
2,Cut off the belt!,I cut off the weird belt... Now I can slip my own belt through the little slits put in the case (on either side) for headphone access. It is a bit fiddly but works fine. The case is nice and small (compared to other CD player carrying cases) and now I don't feel so conspicuous when I wear it.
3,"Palmgren 15"" Lathe",For the price this was a great buy. I use it almost every day. The only problem I've had so far is one of the plastic handles that locks down movement broke. I will make a new one from metal as soon as I get a chance. I do think Palmgren should have made them from metal to start with. For a first lathe I am very happy.
2,Hmmmmm,"I've had my share of problems with this lathe. To be honest, I couldn't recommend it OR the other name it goes under (Craftsman). I've had to have the motor replaced AND the tail stock. As for the companies customer service, they're top notch. But I'd rather buy something I didn't have to call about breaking down. The old adage 'You get what you pay for"" tends to be true on this poorly manufactured lathe."
4,Great value,"Definitely worth the money. Excellent customer service from the manufacturer. I had a small problem due to shipping, called Palmgren and spoke with Mark Kozie who advised they are a small company and rely upon ""word of mouth"" to advertise their product. I would definitely buy this lathe again. I looked at higher priced models and am certainly glad I went with the Palmgren."
4,Palmgren 84315,"This lathe has done all we've asked of it ... so far.... doing 2"" spindles and an 8"" bowl.Don't have enough experience with it yet to give it a 5."
2,Great scans when it works right,"I installed all the software provided, but neither of the two computers I tried it on (one a Vista, the other an XP) recognized the scanner. I surfed HP and found new driver software (dated July 2007), which then worked well. But the real annoyance was the ADF. Absolutely EVERY time I tried the ADF with a clean sheet of plain paper it did not make it through. 100% on the jams! Each time I unjammed it, I had to restart the computer. When scanning from the flatbed platen, there were no problems, and the speed and quality of scans was very good. The on-screen controls are easy and straightforward. Clearly some serious bugs here, but not sure if the driver problem is HP or MS. If it was not an ADF machine, I'd probably be quite happy with it now. Having paid a premium for an ADF device, the mechanical problems are simply unacceptable."
5,Enthralling!,"I've loved this documentary since seeing it the first time years ago. The footage of various tornadoes is captivating. The creepy music gives the film an ominous tone. Despite mistakes in some cases with regards to a tornado's location, the film is still five star for the sheer heart-bounding action. Highly recommended."
5,Hypnotic,"This tornado documentary is a work of art. The power and destruction of tornadoes is backed by a soundtrack of electronic music that is haunting and beautiful. It is mood-altering. The documentary side of it features facts (and a little bit of poetry) from a few narrators, including Neil Armstrong. I'm no expert on tornadoes, so I can't judge the accuracy of the facts. The footage of tornadoes dates back all the way to 1928.The most captivating thing about it, though, is that for long stretches of the program, the narrator is silent, with only the ambient music and occasionally sounds from the tornadoes creating the atmosphere to match these stunning images. Like listening to Tangerine Dream, this film is spellbinding enough to put me in a trance."
5,"Underrated singer ,beautiful voice,excellent album","One of the most underrated singers. Her voice,delivery,style is perfect!The Hunter,a beautiful effort by Jennifer,especially ""Lights of Louisann""If you like this album, you need to get ""Shot Thru The Heart"""
5,Fantastic audiophile edition !!!,"This The Hunter edition is wonderful. If you are a audiophile or not, this CD will change your idea about real music! There is no background noise! The stereo is complete! The voice is divine!The CD is in gold color and is writing 24K gold!!!To everybody that loves pure music in high quality that is the CD to have. There is no mistake, this CD deserve make part of any audiophile collection !!!"
4,This CD has got me Way Down Deep!,"I got this CD primarily for ""Rock You Gently"", but ""Somewhere, Somebody"", ""Way Down Deep"", & ""Pretending to Care"" make this an excellent collection. Having only ever had her Greatest Hits CD which boasts ""Right time of the Night"" made me come to appreciate Jennifer Warnes' voice. This appreciation was deepened w/ The Hunter. The vocals along with the music make this a terrific CD and one for any music lover's collection."
4,A solid and lyrical album,This I like. A nice collection of sensitive and lyrical songs. Soft and moody. An album for lovers. Oddly enough there's a strong presence of Joni Mitchell all the way through. At times it could be either singing.
5,Distilled Merton,"I read this book as a Graduate Theology student. It was part of a semester course on Thomas Merton. Lawrence Cunningham did a great job compiling this anthology.Because Merton was incredibly prolific, it's hard to know where to start--so many books, so many topics. Merton wrote on prayer, contemplation, solitude, war, monasticism, art, etc.I recommend this book as a starting point You can read this anthology and go off in various directions depending on your particular Merton area of interest.Additionally, Cunningham's introduction is worth the price of the book. He is an astute scholar of Merton and brings much wisdom to Merton's life and writing.If you like Thomas Merton, buy this book. You won't be disappointed."
3,not great for empty pickup driving,I put these on a half ton pickup and they simply are to stiff for that. When i have weight in the bed it seems to ride smoother but i rarely haul anything substantial with that truck. put these on your 3/4 ton and up for offroad handling.
4,Decent shock,"I got these to replace the worn out factory gas charged shocks on my 2005 Ram 1500 2wd. I knew they would be a bit ""squishy"" as they are not gas charged and its great on the truck for when i need to get on dirt roads or if i do some 2wd safe trails. A bit weird on the street at times but nothing i'm not used to having driven with non gas charged shocks before.If your main use is street, grab the bilistiens or RS9000's, for a cheaper, decent trail first street second shock these are decent."
5,A true page-turner,"A bit apprehensive after immensely well crafted The Last Unicorn and The Fine and Private Place I was suspicious of a really long lag before coming of Tamsin. But all that evaporated halfway into the first chapter. I found Tamsin to be a great novel hugely entertaining even before all the boggarts got loose. If I had to venture and define it's genre it would be a pastoral ghost story, rich in English folk tradition and reminescent of Simak with his goblins and trolls set in essentially homely Wisconsin countryside. Oh, yeh, my cat loved it too. Now, after this book I take more seriously his chasings of seemingly inocous shadows on the walls - cats, you know, have an eye for bogles and such..."
3,audience?,"I'm not sure what is the right audience for Tamsin. On the one hand it would be helpful to a tween who doesn't know who she is and who feels she doesn't want her life to change. The problems that 13-year-old Jenny [NOT Jennifer] has in New York are all too typical, but that is what she knows. She doesn't want a new life in rural England with a new stepfather & 2 stepbrothers. But it all works out & she has no regrets.But on the other hand, there are the cruel [or at best amoral] elemental forces that Jenny encounters. Perhaps they wouldn't bother tweens because they have no way to differentiate between several years & several centuries. And Tamsin becomes a sister & helps Jenny understand herself better."
2,Some disappointments,"I agree with many of the points made by those who really enjoyed the book but did find some difficulties with much of the beginning section. As a parent who bought this as a book for my daughter and I to read aloud at bedtime I found the frequent early inclusions about 'getting high', the predatory sexual nature of her teacher and references to being hot for another character to be both irrelevant to the character development and frankly inappropriate to a book directed at pre and early teen kids. It seemed very gratuitous and unnecesary and did not further the story development at all."
5,Tamsin,"A remarkable piece of fine literature! Peter Beagle, an author with whom I was not very familiar with before, seems to possess a gift for telling stories. When I first saw the book, I wasn't prepared for anything wonderful, knowing how cheesy and tacky most ""ghost stories"" normally come out. But after the first page I was hooked. The writing never sounds cramped and forced, it flows out in a realistic stream of grace and creativity. I enjoyed Beagle's theory of the supernatural through the main character, Jenny. She says: ""...feelings like that don't die; memories like Tamsin's memory of Edric and her lost sister don't die. That's why you have ghosts."" It's wonderful, simply amazing, how realistic everything comes out. Beagle also has some good mythology in here, as well: the Pooka, the Wild Hunt, and the Lady of the Elder Tree. I highly reccomend this book; it is well worth your time and money."
4,Brilliant,"I loved 'Tamsin'. I was quite surprised to read that it's a ""Young Adult"" novel. I'm far from being a young adult and I loved it.I almost gave up on this book early into it. The first 50 pages sounded exactly like one of those awful books you had to read in grade school, you know..the ones about children growing up without parents and how tough life is. But then this grew into a magical exploration of the ghosts and goblins of England. Highly Recommended."
5,Tamsin is a great read and also a fascinating look at England during the period of Monmouth's rebellion,"I'd recommend it as a spine tingling story to be read with a clandestine flashlight under the covers, or for a family-out-loud shared reading.....It's a mystery to me why it was never made into a movie...."
5,Just Good Writing... Was Emotionally Invested,"It's a story about a girl in New York, Jenny Gluckstein, whose piano playing Mom is remarrying a farmer from England years after her divorce. Jenny fights it all the way, but she's stuck. She has to deal with stepbrothers, losing her friends, and her poor cat being quarantined.Then it's more an English Historical, set in Dorchester, revolving around certain events in Monmouth Rebellion, and it slowly turns into a ghost story, then a supernatural mystery with fantastic elements. Interspersed are slice-of-life moments as Jenny fits into her new family situation.If you don't let the genre shifts throw you, an excellent novel. I will be checking out other works by Mr. Beagle based on the strength of this one."
4,Simple and Sweet,"The book started out a bit slow for me, but I warmed up to the book fairly soon. It is a gentle book that I looked forward to reading."
5,If CNN does not limit your mind.,"After Sep 11 everyone stopped asking why this happened to us, and started concentrating on the revenge war. This book shades a light on a reality that the US Media/Government tries hard to hide."
4,Moral philosopher thinks about terrorism,"Looks at the moral issues around terrorism. Deals with questions like: what is to count as a 'good life'? Why is terrorism morally wrong? To what extent are Western countries materially and morally responsible for the terrorism they experience? Under what conditions is terrorism morally justified? What kind of opposition to one's own state is morally justified? Honderich is a consequentialist: his ""principle of humanity"" is that we should attempt to drag people out of ""bad lives""."
2,A Valiant Effort at Failed Philosophy,"Honderich's After the Terror is indeed a welcome attempt to explain terrorism. However, the philsophical basis of Honderich's arguements are notably poor, and the reasoning behind his statements weaker still. Honderich's book is thought provoking in the way theories of intelligent design are thought provoking. They are held to be wrong, and almost entirely indefensible by the whole of the academic community, and yet one should never say alternative theories should be ignored altogether. Although it makes for bad philosophy, one cannot blame those outside the mainstream for attempting to bring some into their flock."
1,Its All America's Fault!,"Ted Honderich takes a trip down victimology lane to explain how the attacks were caused by American foreign policy. While it is fair to make this a hypothesis, the lack of balanced factual discussion in the book lays bare the hidden agenda of the author's glee in being able to say ""I told you so!""The only good thing I can say about the book is at only 160 pages it mercifully short compared to other works on this topic."
1,not correct item,"this item shows up as being compatable for a 2004 ford explorer and for explorer sport but the 2004 explorer front seat handles should be for a round fit not a square fit and this item listed when i received it, stated it was for a 99-2001 explorer only.. be aware pay attention to item.."
3,Not a cog belt,I recieved a P drive belt. The reason I ordered this belt was because it states it is a cog drive. I wanted a cog drive! The P drive belt worked ok and I needed it for a weekend car show. Hope I can still get a cog drive. Even the picture shows a cog drive.
3,A good Build up to Volume 4...,"First of all, I found volume 3 far better then volume 2.This Volume is worth a read and those missing Nightwing and Robin will be glad to see their return. Also, there is a great story involving poison Ivy and Clayface and even Superman makes an appearance. Very enjoyable.If you found Volume 2 to lack some of the qualities of Volume 1, as I did, Volume 3 renews faith in where this epic story is going.I gave it 3 stars simply because at the same time...It didn't blow my mind. Sure there were some great twists to the story,The new Batgirl and so forth but generally this is still a build up to thenext Volume.Also, another reason why I took a Star away from this is because this volume does not include Nightwing #35-39 which deal with Nightwing going to BlackGate, It's simply mentioned in this volume but not shown at all.Hope this helped!"
3,Skaterville.,"This was a movie I found for one dollar, and it was worth about that. Honestly I did kind of like it. It is however less a movie about skateing, as it is about this group of kids, that skate. It was typical suburbia, teens wishing they could get away, and doing what they can with what they have. What I related to most was the fling the main kid had with his teacher. I was in a situation like that before, and found it to be pretty much the exact experience I had. The music was good, dialogue decent. Overall I'd say if you've ever been in high school, and been a part of the skate scene, you should dig Levelland."
1,THIS IS NOT THE RONNIE MONTROSE BAND,This was a hip hop band...and NOT the famous GAMMA of the 80s.I wish the copyright jerkweeds would get off their collective asses and do what they get paid to do....by making sure there aren't people going around using other peoples names to release music....I had the same thing happen when I bought a CD by a 70's British band called GYPSY......they were NOT the American band from the same early 70's era....it cost me $15.00 to find that out....even tho they were a good band....they were complete unknowns in America.This hip hop band is probably a bigger disappointment for anybody who got stuck buying their CD and expecting the original Gamma.The one star rating is for the fact...I hate hip hop...
4,Gamma - Hip Hop,"It's true these guys have taken the name of a previous group, but, hearing what their music is and where they're from, it would be no surprise that they've never heard of the first Gamma band. As for the music, it's ok, not great but if your into rap then they've got some interesting things to say. It's not your everyday materialistic/pimp wanabee type affair, but it has very dark and moody type lamenting haunting feel to it.Deep thinkers not for your shallow rock types..."
5,michigan history,"Very detailed book on Michigan history......Everything about it is interesting from 11,000 BC to 1865 .....many many facts not found in other Mich history books ..It is one of my favorites .... this book I would grade 5 out of 5 stars as one of the best."
4,"One Guitar, All Vocals","Everyone knows what a talented guitarist Kottke is. This album features his gifts with his second instrument--his voice. Sure, his trademark guitar sound is there on every track, but these are all vocal tracks and his voice is used to wonderful effect. Some fans may feel this was a wrong-headed turn for Kottke, but it shouldn't have come as a surprise. Go back to Kottke's 1974 Ice Water and listen to ""Tilt Billings and the Student Prince"" and you hear the genesis for this album. I've always loved Kottke's voice as well as his guitar playing. As such, this is one of my favorite albums. RECOMMENDED"
3,not what I would expect,"I've always loved leo's guitar standing alone. Why Oh Why does a drum track show up with his work? I'm spoiled by ""One Guitar, No Voice"" perhaps but this has no ""driving solo"" if you will excuse the cliche, nor does it satisfy. It's like committee Kottke if you will. Backup singers, flute (although i kindda liked that; i play)and the drumming. Leo carries a pulse all of his own and i think putting other percussion instruments in his mix obscures his sound. Had i known i would have bought the Stevie Nicks album i was also considering, i could only afford one.....peace-ken"
4,Adequate for the student of pharmacy,"Well written and adequate for the student of pharmacy. However for this audience I would recommend Wilson and Gisvold's Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical chemistry 11th Ed, because the figures and text are more complete providing a clearer more concise and rigorous treatment of the subject."
1,Professors: please don't get this book for your class!,"It amazes me that a book in its 6th edition would still have so many errors. In chapter 2 alone I found 5 errors. As a student, it makes me wonder how many more errors there are that I am just accepting as fact. It provides sparse case studies, but the answers are not given in the book, and many of the answers are not given online either to the students, and are only available for professors to see. Perhaps wait for the 7th edition to come out, and hope that they iron out the mistakes they made in this one."
4,Med Chem Text,"I haven't actually used this book yet (so far the professor has given us excellent notes), but it is full of information that I'll probably use when I need to review everything. Very comprehensive for reviewing a specific topic, but a bit boring to just read."
4,"Good product, poor handling","The book itself was a required text for one of my college courses and it fulfills it's purpose adequately. My only problem was with the condition that it arrived in. I paid for a brand new product and it arrived with a huge gouge in the front cover and binding as a result of poor handling by Amazon. It was obviously not a result of shipping as the packaging it came in was not damaged at all. It was damaged by Amazon prior to shipping it out. With such poor merchandise treatment, I will definately rethink using Amazon as a future supplier."
1,Sending them back.,"The spoons are sharp. I had high expectations at this price. I am returning them for a refund and will have to try another brand.Edit: to be more explanatory, I did not use the flatwear. I opened the box and took a look at the spoons, determined they felt sharp and even had some nicks in the edges, then boxed them back up.I have since purchased the pearl set from liberty tabletop, which I am keeping."
4,Great Purchase,Got this table to switch out for glass since we have a crawling baby now. a little smaller than I expected but great quality and just what we needed.
1,Poorly made,Poorly made...the mounting holes were actually on the wrong side of each leg. No matter how I tried it would not work unless I drilled new holes. The workman ship is aweful..the mounting parts actually fell apart. Now I know why it was the cheapest table offered. Do yourself a favor and don't order. The table is now on the trash heap...Pay a few dollars more to get a better made table. You get what you pay for always holds true.
3,This is a nice item once you get it together!,This is a nice item once you get it together!Should have been easy but it took hours and extra tools because the bolts would not reach were they needed to reach. Poor quality control on the part of the manufacture.
1,"cheap, cheap, cheap,","This product is cheap piece of junk. It looks like a pressed paper, not wood!I got even damaged one on the second self. Everyone can tell this is just pressed-sawdust.Don't waste your money."
3,"Like the table, hate the idiot who sent the wrong screws!!!","I do like this table. I wish people in asian countries who build this stuff (man,woman,or child). Would make sure that I get the proper components to assemble my furnature properly. So I ended up paying a few extra dollars at my local hardware store for longer screws. Which by the way are metric for those of you who might think of getting this table. Anyhow, it's not a terrible buy for the money. Way better than the broken piece of crap tv stand i got @ tvstands.com that I had to return. Good luck shopping everyone!!!"
4,"Sturdy, solidly made table.","The quality of this table exceeded my expectations. It's solidly made and has a nice medium-to-dark chestnut finish (blends well w/ my antique furniture). I'm using it as a TV stand in my bedroom (can probably fit up to a 32"" flat screen).I've done my research, and it's the tallest table in this priced category (and amazon.com has the best price {incl. shipping}). It was packaged well. The only reason I rated it 4/5 stars was because it was cumbersome to put together- although anything w/ that requires an allen key makes assembly a bit of a nuisance."
2,Assembly= nightmare,"The quality of the table was good but the assembly was very challenging. The main problem was that the predrilled holes were not predrilled correctly. In fact, one hole was not drilled through and I had to do that myself. This has made for an unstable table."
2,WINSOME HALF MOON TABLE,The packing was not sturdy. Table looks and color are as described.It does not look new. Lot of scratches (to cover up)have been painted.a SECOND HAND TABLE THOUGH PAID FOR A NEW ONE.
3,Acceptable,"Table looks just like it does in the photo. The wood has some natural imperfections, which is normal and totally acceptable. However mine came with a small ding in one of the legs, which clearly happened after the finish was applied. One of legs fits looser than it should due to a minor misalignment when it was drilled.In all, it's a nice table and I will keep it. I imagine my issues are not typical."
2,could have done better.....,The package arrived on a rainy day and was placed outside our door with only a plastic bag covering the top of the product. By the time we got home later in the day the bottom of the packaging was soaked; it was ruined so making a return in the original packaging would have been impossible. As with the first table we received and returned the packaging was insufficient to prevent damage; this particular table had apparently been dropped; one corner is slightly damaged.The table itself is full of flaws and doesn't fit together correctly. One leg is slightly tilted. While the table has a nice appearance from a distance once you get close it's easy to see all of the flaws and poor craftmanship.Overall quality: DPackaging materials: FOverall finish: DOverall value: DWe've tried twice now and both tables have been very poor; apparently there is very little if any quality control where the tables are manufactured in Thailand.We won't be buying any more furniture through Amazon.
2,"nice table, but many flaud finishing work","I like the table, but the finishing work is terrible. Would return, but I hate the hastle. I believe the seller should give me a discount on this item. I will have to put something on the top to cover up the manfacturing goof ups. Really dissappointed. Guess I won't be ordering much more."
3,wobble wobble,"product was assembled for me - however, although the wood is very fine the item is wobbly and slight askew a production flaw no doubt - it was professionally asssembled so not myu fault - too much trouble to take apart and ship back"
2,Price is crazy,I love the old cartoons. But its just crazy to pay $2 for 14 min episodes. When I spend $2 on other tv shows that are 45min long.
4,CRACKS ME UP,"Pretty interesting seeing the gags stacked up back to back. Having seen it through the years my general thought along with everyone was that it's the same damn tricks and trials over and over, but it's another thing to see the formula spelled out one after another :)Definitely a good collection to have handy"
2,Frustration with Amazon.Com,"I still have the same problem. The Loonie Tunes cartoons that I paid for and downloaded, should be in memory in the Kindle Fire. I can view them as long I am at home, yet, if I leave the house, where the Modem is, I cannot view them in any other locale. Amazon.Com has not cured the problem, although I spent considerable time, a few weeks ago, with 5 different technicians, and the problem remains. I downloaded Hatari and it is in memory and I can view it at the hospital or anywhere else."
5,Great Song,This is a great song I'm not a woman but when I heard that Willa had released a new single I knew I had to have it! I love it for the lyrics and because this is a woman's song to show us men that they can do well without us. Go willa I love you!!
5,She's baaaack!!,I was really happy to hear new material from Willa. This is a great song. I can't wait for her sophomore release.
4,I'm not gonna write her off just yet....,"I made a mistake in 2001 by purchasing the full album, ""Willa Was Here"", it had to be the biggest butchering to music ever done by anyone. I can easily say that ""I Wanna Be Bad"" was the only good song of the album, but even that got played out in the end. So I thought I'd totally write Willa off, but she impressed me with this song. This song is fun, catchy, dancy, and true, so I gotta hand it to her, and I'm not gonna write her off just yet.... but I am expecting more from the next album, if the next album is just another ""Willa Was Here"" with one good song on it, then shes being permanently removed from the list of artists I listen to."
5,Works Like a Charm,"I don't know how, but this stuff works. My bottle is the one that has like 1000 mg per pill. Instead of taking 2, I actually take 3 each time, before and after I eat. The next morning when I weigh myself, I am still at the same weight. Usually I would have gained a couple of pounds. For instance last night the family went to Golden Corral. I ate sooo much food on purpose just to put this stuff to the test. I had like 3 desserts, and quite a few of their yeast rolls with butter, yum! In the morning I was still the same weight. The morning before last I had donuts and kolaches for breakfast, a sure fire no no on my diet. Again....no weight gain. I read on some other sites that it tended to make some others go to the bathroom. I have not had this problem yet. I will definitely be stocking up for the holidays!"
4,DRINK WATER!!!,"If you drink water and plenty of it, this product works. It should be easy because it will make you thirsty! I have never wanted to drink as much water as I am drinking right now. Im on my 5th 16oz glass of the day and its only noontime."
3,I'm unsure if this product is helping or not.,I've been using this product for about a month now. It may be working or it may not be. Its very difficult to tell. I probably wont purchase again.
3,Australian Book Lover,"The book is a mixture of tidbits about famous collectors, the author's coming of age in Australia, obscure collectibles/authors, and whatever else came to the author's mind. Maybe a hardcore collector could keep up with this account.I gave it up after 118 pages. I love books and was interested in the Australian descriptions, but became discouraged by the disjointedness of the book."
4,Great summer read,"I have spent the last week enjoying this amusing memoir from a book collector. Some chapters can be skipped through, perhaps, quickly but all in all a lot of fun - great for an evening patio read!"
4,Schleich Set of 6 wild animals,"These animals are nice quality, as expected, but I noticed after I ordered this, that they are the older versions of Schleich animals, I don't like the lion, I went ahead and ordered another lion (I was ordering the families to go with these animals for my daughter)and I'm giving this one away to my daughter's friend. Also, the white tigers were different from the newer version. It's not enough to make me return them, because my daughter is only turning 3 and she won't care."
5,Essential reading for those looking for love,"Finding True Love: The Four Essential Keys to Discovering the Love of Your Life by Daphne Rose Kingma is a jewel of a book that I recommend to anyone who is looking for a new love. I used it myself when I was in the process of dissolving my third marriage and realized that something needed to change. What I discovered was that thing that needed to change was me!I used Kingma's book as one of two to take me through the process of self-examination and renewed hope. The four keys that she proposes are faith, intention, trust and surrender. Each section on a particular key is broken down into chapters with exercises to do within each chapter. The book is enlivened by stories about people that Kingma has known in her psychotherapy practice."
4,I like this book and author,"I am still reading but like this book so far. In a world that teaches us to not like our bodies, our jobs, our lives, etc. It is good to get back in touch with love"
2,not that great,"i received this case free with my minidisc player and i am not particularly fond of it. the armband slides around on my arm, with a minidisc in the case it is very hard to close, and can't hold anything else. it does prevent scratches however. if you need a functional case do not buy this one."
2,half decent product,"This case came with my mini disc player and i was not satisfied at all. the band does slide on my arm. with the one extra mini disc in the pouch i was unable to close it without having it pop open. the one thing i absolutly like about this product is... well... NOTHING. i can however give this case 2 stars because it prevents scratches. finally if there are any recomedations to buy this product, DON'T listen to them."
3,What I expected,"I ordered this item because it is annoying to carry around my md player at the gym. I didn't expect a lot from the product - obviously, it's not going to be all nice and streamline because the player is pretty bulky to begin with.Biggest complaint is that the strap is really big if you have a small arm. If I pull it tight enough, the velcro is actually past the point where it sticks. Instead, I fold the strap slightly so that it will work - annoying, but works out in the end.Don't expect a lot from this product and you will be happy."
4,Works alright,"I bought this to hold my md player hoping for some little cast just to not let it get scratched. This isn't the one for that, it holds sony md players and one extra md but nothing else. I wish it would hold more for it's size but since I can get over 5 hours on one mini disk, it's fine. The arm band works great but it's annoying when you don't want to use it. I really does protect your md player well though"
1,Measurements were misleading.,"Product was advertised as a case with certain measurements, but that was understood to mean the measurements which would fit the object for which I wanted to use it. Unfortunately, it was the measurements when the case was completely opened up. Product was useless to me. Got my refund though, and without having to send it back!"
4,Perfect for my son,My son had surgery and a cast put on. This product worked great to keep his leg dry while showering. It was a bit cumbersome but overall a great value for the 4 weeks that we needed it.
1,"Don't buy, opt for a waterproof cast","I ordered the half-leg cast cover last year after a foot/leg surgery to be able to still swim. It worked great, but occasionally if the cast shifted down it would cause the cast cover to burp allowing a small amount of water in, so this year having the same surgery I thought the full leg would provide a better seal. THe full leg cover is horrible!!!! First I ordered the medium based on their measurements and measured about 2/3 up my thigh about where the picture shows on the model. The cast cover only went barely above my knee, so the medium was far too big. I returned it for a small which fit but it does not stay on my leg based on how low it is on my leg. The cast cover constantly rolls down and a cannot bend my leg without the seal breaking.This product may work fine if you are 5'2"", but NOT 5'8"" or taller!!! I was very disappointed"
2,Download album is missing the Music for Mallet Instruments!,"I love Reich's music and was looking forward to hearing a different version of the Music For Mallet Instruments etc. that is on this album. The problem is, the downloaded mp3 version of this album only contains ""The Four Sections."" The Music for Mallet Instruments is not on the mp3 album, even though we're paying the full album price and the piece is included in the album title."
1,Be aware,"I did not actually order this item (21"" tall metal 2 tier bird bath feeder). I wanted to, but I checked with Amazon. The shipping charge for this item according to the Amazon rep that called me would have been $62. This is not a typo...sixty-two dollars. I live within the continental U.S. The price per pound is $3.50 on top of the flat per item shipping charge. Just be aware of this before ordering this item. So much for the nice inexpensive ($22) bird bath."
5,This is one of my favorite books.,"Terry Willits' book is similar to Alexandra Stoddard's book Living a Beautiful Life. Terry shows readers how to awaken their five senses by making things in their homes look, sound, feel, smell, and taste wonderful. She emphasizes creating a God-centered home and focuses on using the beauty of our homes to nurture the people we love. I enjoyed this book and didn't want it to end. It's a must-read!"
3,"Pretty, but flimsy!","I have no idea how this is standing on its own in the picture, but I had to secure mine to the wall that it stood perpendicular to in order to have it stay up.It's pretty, but was not as sturdy as I thought it might be."
3,"OK, but rather chinzy","I bought two types of Reed Fence to use as matting on the inside of a Native American longhouse we're building. This product used smaller reeds and had more breaks than the other, 6' wide product we actually selected. I'd try to look at a roll before you purchase too much."
3,Price,While looking online it looked like a good deal. Some how I thought I was ordering 6 x 16ft not exactly sure how I messed that up but the 4 x 8 that I did get was not 4 x 10 and they have the exact same ones at Home Depot for less that 10 dollars a peice I paid $24 + here for them. Its exactly what I was looking for except for the size but I thought I was getting a deal for $24 for 6 x 16.. Instead I got ripped of $24 for 4x8 or 4x10 whatever. Should have just went to Home Depot the first time!
1,Big Disappointment,"We bought this product for our 4 year old so she could participate in a big family event that included swimming. I ordered it with time to spare. It arrived 3 days AFTER the party. We figured we would still try it out for the rest of the summer and it was way too small. We followed the measurements when ordering. My daughter is 28 pounds, very small for her age and her arm is smaller than the 6-7"" size. She said it hurt when putting it on. So it has never been used. Complete waste of money."
1,Not returnable,"My 7 year old son broke his wrist and the Dr.'s office gave us a brochure for Xerosox. I took his measurements and ordered. Unfortunately, he couldn't even get his hand into the x-small size. When I decided to exchange for the next size up I was told by Medical Department Stores that Xerosox are not returnable or exchangeable. That would have been nice to know before I placed the order. Now I am stuck with this and my son is still out of the water."
1,DO NOT FIT!!!,"I hate this jean so much, it is not what i expected at all. the boot-cut in too flare out, but i cant really complain about that. The size i got was 0 x 34. The leg was too long, and my leg is not short. the waist fit good, but it feel a lot like cowboy boot, which is what they are, but i do not like. My problem is that the pair of jeans is too big, from thign to leg, it is too big, i can fit one and a half of my leg in it. I dont think i will be able to wear it. As for the material, nothing special, which is fine for the price."
1,Pat the Critic,"The service obtaining them was great, but the movies were very marginal. I already gave them away as a ""gag gift""."
5,Rugged Manchild,"If you have been an avid Wu-Tang fan for years, then I can't tell you anything. I grew up on Wu-Tang and Shyheim so for me it's like going back to my teenage years and feeling all of the rebellion that youths feel. I love it. If you like rugged rap, streetmusic then you'll definitely want to pick this up.If you're new to the Wu, you may or may not like it, this is the street Wu, not all that Industry rap that sells, this is the underground.Welcome"
4,And I can't stand rappers under 18,Most rappers under 18 suck but Shyheim is one of the illest to ever do this. He was nice back then and the game misses him now. This is from what I call the golden era of hiphop before the beat went corporate.
4,Pretty Good,"This is the first CD of shyheim, but for a kid who is barely a teenager, it's phat. It's oldschool, but great for the Wu-Tang fans. Only the best of the undergroung Wu-family fans know about it, so if you do, I recommend it. It probably just won't be your favorite."
3,An okay event.,"Smackdown pay-per-views always seem to be much more lackluster than the Raw ones. This event is no exception. There are few strong matches.THE EVENT* Tag Titles: MNM (c) vs. Paul London & Brian Kendrick. This was MNM's last match before they broke up* King of the Ring 1993 crowning (Bret Hart)* Chris Benoit vs. Finlay* Jillian Hall vs. Melina* King of the Ring 1996 crowning (Steve Austin)* Cruiserweight Title: Gregory Helms (c) vs. Super Crazy* King of the Ring 2000 crowning (Kurt Angle)* Kurt Angle vs. Mark Henry* King of the Ring Finals: Booker T vs. Bobby Lashley* Undertaker vs. Great Khali* World Title: Rey Mysterio (c) vs. JBLEXTRAS* Chavo & Vickie discuss Chavo's future plans* Interview with Khali* Smackdown 5/26 - King of the Ring crowningThe lack of hot matches on this card make it an average ppv. History may only remember this event as the night MNM broke up, depending on how popular Johnny Nitro becomes as a singles wrestler."

3,Diva Match Only,Jillian Hall vs MelinaThis match was pretty good. Execpt that when Melina hit the Tornado Facebuster she should've won that's why i give it a 3.
1,This PPV Sucked!! Very Boring!!,"I am a Huge fan of WWE, but this Sucked!! The best matches like Angle vs Henry, ended in a countout, Undertaker vs Kali, very boring, Kali is not a Wrestler, just a circus Freak.The main event, come on!!, JBL could just kicked his a#s, but he didnt, and at the end, the charity case, retains his belt.NOTE: Rey Mysterio has just won like 1 match as the World Chimp, definitely making this belt a joke. What a diference when the belt belonged to RAW.In my opinion, Smackdown lacks talent, and now that RAW has Dx back, WOW!!, also you have all the great talent going to ECW, I think this might just be the end of Smackdown."

3,Not the Basics,"If you want to know about Haydn and Mozart and their contributions to the Classical era, this is your book. However, if you want to know the fundamentals of the Classic period, get something else. The book rarely provides definitions or explains things in context. Rather, it will title a chapter, The Classic Sonata, and then have the subcategories, Haydn's Sonatas, Mozart's Sonatas. It was difficult to find information about the era and forms of music in general. Should have been titled Music in the Classic Period Shown Through Haydn and Mozart."
4,Good Book,"If you are interested in studying classical history with a focus on Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, this book serves that purpose well."
5,Might as well be in a cemetery~!,"This CD is GREAT. It's moody, almost creepy, but never boring. It would be the perfect music for Halloween or to listen while taking a stroll in the cemetery. I've played it a number of times over the years, and I never get tired of listening to it. Adams and Ives are wonderful composers!"
4,Decent,"The sound is quite decent for listening to I-Pods, MP3s. If it was up to me I think it needs an on\off switch"
2,Tinny indeed,I agree with the viewer preceding me. Very tinny. The ones I was using from my old computer sound 100% better. These are a complete waste. Two stars because I do hear the music but it sounds awful.
2,what a waste,"These have to be the worst speakers created. I expected a lot more from Sony, but I guess everyone is allowed to make a mistake. The only thing these are good for is to watch a movie on your computer if your laptop speakers are not that loud for dialogue, other than that I use my laptop speakers to listen to music."
5,great value,sony is always one of the best and the mega bass is hard to find. bought these to use with my XM radio at work.
2,BAD SOUND QUALITY,"The sound when hooked up to computer was very ""brassy"" and had static. It was too late after item was given to return. I would have sent it back."
3,Jobim meets Fennesz!,"Not alltogether satisfying, this experimental latin tinged electronic does have it's moments. The majority of this brief disc does cater to the the sound warping techniques used throughout the microbeat laptop scene, normally favoring more textural voice and noise varieties rather then blatant Prefuse- like beats. The short length makes the meat and potatoes of this disc, which feature some breezy melodies and vocals, ambient production, coupled with that backbone of Herren's usual drive, really fade from the mostly atmospheric experimentation found throughout. While pursuing this interesting territory in the future, I feel Savath would be served best by cutting the ironic and jarring tones they use to contrast their melodic folk to a minimum and instead focus on involving the listener moreso into their aural quest of bridging past and future."
1,EMBARRASSING,this is one of the worst ppvs ever and shocking. it is an insult to any one with a i q over 50.carlito v masters6/10. decent stuffmickie v trish2/10 their worst match to date. rubbish finishkane v big show1/10 rubbish. embarassing and not wrestlingrvd v shelton benj6/10 decentmcmahons v michaels1/10 again an embarrasment to pro wrestlinghhh v cena v edge7.5/10good main event thank god
3,Sick of WWE and Cena;,"I am so damn sick of the WWE keeping Cena as champ.In case the dumb ass creative team(those who write the storylines to keep WWE entertaining)havent noticed Cena has been getting booed for about the past 5 months now.First they were slow booes now they are loud as hell booes that almost everyone in the arena,ppv's and at home watching Raw can hear.Also at Wrestlemania 22 Cena got booed during his entrance all the way to the end of the match when he made HHH tap out.I am so sick of that wannabe rapper as champ.Vince please take the belt off Cena you dumb,arrogant son of an b*tch!"
2,Backlash 2006,"Okay, everyone knows that this wont be the most spectacular PPV, but it will be worth watching here are my predictions for this year's Backlash live April 30th!Street Fight MatchCarlito ""Cool"" Vs.""The Masterpiece""Chris Masterswinner: CarlitoWWE Womens Championship Rematch(C) Mickie James Vs.

4,reviews,"This PPV hasen't even taken place yet. To the person who made his predictions for the show, that card is stupid. Do you even watch wrestling? Anyways, have fun everyone watching it on TV. I'm going to be there."
3,"WWE Backlash 2006 (4-30-06) Lexington, Kentucky",WWE ChampionshipJohn Cena (c) vs HHHIntercontinental TitleShelton Benjamin (c) vs RVDWorld Tag Team ChampionshipKane/Big Show (c) vs Carlito/MastersAlso about 3 more matches will be signed. Won't be as good as last year's Backlash PPV.
3,Why WWE is failing these days;,"WWE is failing these days becuase they are too obscesed with storylines and weird gimmicks.Here are an bunch of examples;The God Angle with HBK and the McMahons,the Mickie/Trish Feud, Paul Burchill being an pirate,The Spirit Squad,The Boogey Man an others.If the WWE could focus more on the product(wrestling)and less of the storylines the WWE would be ok.Like on Raw there is RVD,Ric Flair,HBK,Kane,and others who can really wrestle and on SmackDown there is Randy Orton,Kurt Angle,Undertaker,Rey Mysterio,Chris Benoit,and Booker T who can wrestle really good too but the storylines are just interfering way too much and taking away from wrestling.Thats why the WWE needs less storylines and more wrestling just like in the old days for it too be an profitable company again."
2,Absolute basics- easy enough to figure it out on your own.,"I was expecting much more information than I got. It was only an hour long with 12-15 subjects covered. A brief skimming, if you will. I found a couple of things helpful but all in all I had figured out most of what was went over on my own. This seems more geared to one who has very little computer experience- not just limited quickbooks knowledge. It does say beginner and it really means it! I gave it two stars because although it wasn't much use to me, the information was presented well enough and it gave a good idea of what can be done with the program."
5,WOW!,I have so much more respect for the Islamic religion and culture now. This book gave me a deep understanding of that as well as an insight to the country of Saudi Arabia-something I previously knew nothing about. This book is fantastic. I would describe it as a page turner with an excellent author. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone. It gave me a new appreciation for being an American.
1,soso,"i got this book because i was really interested in the middle east, but didn't know a thing about it. that's pretty much what this book is good for. i was really happy with the information i got out of it, but between the author's sappy, (not to mention DUMB) commentary and the appalling editing job i got pretty annoyed with the book by the time i was half way through. so that's my opinion. it's good if you just want some of the basic interesting info about Saudi Arabia, but steer clear of it if you have ever read anything about the subject before. My main feeling was that i just wanted the info and for the author to BUTT OUT."
2,Too hard to put together,I had to return this product as I could not put it together. It was very hard to get the tub to open enough for the poles and I didn't want to have to force them and possibly break one.
1,"Quite a bit ""Muskier"" than I expected","From all of the positive reviews I read on this cologne, I decided to ""blind"" purchase it. The item was delivered promptly - no problems there. My main concern is that the product description never mentioned it being very musky. I applied the cologne on this morning and instantly noticed the strong musk from this cologne. I highly recommend you got to a store that carries it before purchasing online. I would not recommend this product to anyone that does not like a musky cologne. Cologne's sold by amazon are non-returnable, so always take that into consideration."
4,"Nice cologne, but not for me","After reading many of the reviews, I decided to go for this stuff. The shipping was lighting fast, and the product arrived in fine condition, but I expected the scent to be a lot more masculine than it was. It's a bit masculine, but also it's got a sweet smell too. This cologne smells a bit unisex to me. Don't get me wrong, it's decent and I'll continue to wear it, but the other reviews are a bit misleading."
5,Good Cologne!,Lucky You smells great without having an overpowering scent. I definately recommend it to anyone.
2,"be careful, some are non authentics","i absolutely love this scent. i know this will sound weird, but those of you out there who have bought some of these here will know what i'm talking about. I've purchased dozens of bottles of this cologne, and the ones i am getting from amazon are not authentic. the two that i have purchased here (3.4 oz bottles from two different sellers) have been good the first week that i have them and then after that it smells like rubbing alcohol. this is not real, someone somewhere is doing something to these bottles to sabotage them."
3,Smells good but doesn't last,"Smells really good when you put on.. but after a while you cannot even notice the smell. With all the good reviews, I went with this.. but looks it din't worked out for me. I will try something else."
5,Extreme Quality Cologne,"I bought this cologne online without smelling it, just hoping that I would be satisfied. DANG! This smells amazing! It has that warmish smell you get from Abercrombie, Hollister, Aqua Di Gio, Etc."
2,Smells cheap,"Smells extremely cheap, and after wearing it for about 15-20 minutes a terrible after smell similar to axe body spray and cigarettes lingers. Would not recommend this product if you are a grown man."
1,Box was all banged up,Pretty good scent but the handling of the product was horrible. The box was all dented and the top ripped. When i opened the box i found the cologne to be cracked but not leaking thankfully. Good scent but absolutely horrible shipping. Was not satisfied
3,Meh,"I got kinda over this stuff after about a week. It started to smell really, just i don't know kinda soapy"
3,Its i'ight,"Smell good, but its easy to get tired of. It's a light smell and it doesn't last as long as I would like, but I cant complain with the price."
3,It's just ok for me,"Tried it just for once and see how it smells ... The fragrance is good but is too strong for me, I must say. Maybe, I'll wear this with few sprays and that's it. I'll rate this as average."
2,Smell is good but fades quickly,This smell is very nice. The only problem I have is that it doesn't last nearly as long as other colognes. It loses strength very quickly.
4,"Smells fresh, little powder, but still slightly masculine","I was very satisfied with this purchase. The smell is great. Fresh, clean, touch of powder, yet still notably masculine overall. The bottle looks great as well, and the spray applicator works flawlessly. I would have given this 5 stars instead of 4 were it not for the fact that, for me, the scent leaves after about three hours. I guess that is not too bad, and I would definitely make this purchase again just for the awesome scent."
4,"Light, Clean, & Subtle","I typically order cologne on Amazon - the selection is incredible and the prices are impressive. When I recognize the name of a brand or designer fragrance and see that it is under 20 bucks, I take a chance and just order it, even if I have no clue what it smells like (understanding that each fragrance is unique to one's own body chemistry). 'Lucky You' was not a disappointment - the scent is clean (fresh, light), but exotic at the same time. It isn't strong, but even after a long day, the scent is still subltle enough to notice. It arrived promptly, in excellent condition, as usual!"
2,not what I expected..,Well I should known better then falling for the clearence price.smell like pure alcohol.if you planing on buy it do not use it while driving you auto or heavy equipment it might impair you ability.
5,Sexy and cheap!,Too sexy of a smell for such a cheap price! It doesn't matter if you have never sniffed this scent. It's worth buying it blind.
5,"Cheap, smells great","Awesome cologne, very cheap price, smells nice, fresh, kind of ""springy"". Absolutely recommendable. If you're in doubt, I mean, it's just so inexpensive you could just give it to somebody or as a present. There's no going wrong with this product, either you like it or somebody you know will."
4,Good scent!,I really like this cologne! I was looking for a citrus-scented cologne online and this one came up. The price was right! Give it a shot.
4,Wonderful cologne with lasting impressions,First time using this cologne and I am really impressed. It doesn't have an overpowering scent like others where people next to you are gasping for air. The smell is subtle yet smooth - And it seems like the ladies notice it..even if you think the smell has faded. I've had several women comment on the cologne...and my wife goes crazy whenever she smells it. Not sure what they put in it - but it definitely does something to the females.It is great in the office...or for a night out.It has a similar smell to liz claiborne sport..but not as strong.4 stars since the smell seems does not last as long as other colognesHighly recommended item
2,Sent wrong product.,"Unless I'm mistaken and the bottle is supposed to be pink and smell like panties.But I'll quote the page: ""a youthful blend of fresh citrus."" - and hookers. ""A Fragrance product created for Men"" - wow, even the product page specifically gets it wrong.Ordered through tuccini. Every other order from them was fine; maybe they're color blind and don't have noses. Or eyeballs. Though I doubt it, because how would they operate as a business if that were the case?They sent me perfume, not cologne. Great job, guys. What am I going to do with 3.4 ounces of perfume? Probably throw away. I mean, it smells good, no doubt, and was cheap. Just thought ordering ""cologne spray"" with a picture of a blue bottle of men's cologne would mean I would get cologne. Gets two stars because at least my thrash smells like a hot stripper now."
5,"Finally, someone with answers!","This book has the answers you won't hear many other places! Its not stress! It's in the food you eat, it's called ""Fructose Intolerance"". Dr. Gibbons tells you what to do to regain a normal life. Along with the University of Iowa website support for DFI (dietary fructose intolerance), you will have the answers you need."
5,Finally something worked!!,"I have gone through five other books promising to solve IBS problems with diet. I have tried the low fiber, no dairy, no sugar (besides fruit and honey)no gluten, and no starch diets. I was strict with all of those diets and had no results. After a year of suffering daily with IBS I was feeling better in 5 days with just this one method. And the best part is I didn't have to change that much about how I was eating!!"
4,Seiko,"Very nice watch. If not for the Seiko name (and typical quartz watch second hand movement), one might mistake it for a higher end swiss. For those needing high contrast hands/dial, this one might not work for you."
2,Book Returned,"The description of what this book offers is completely misleading. This book is the equivalent of a Webster's Dictionary. I opened the book with my mother and after 5 minutes we were like ""Oh No."" We returned it to Amazon."
3,Descent but not great,"I got this horn set as a replacement to the OEM horn on my car. It's a bit louder than the horns found on most passenger cars, but it's nowhere near the kind of sound you get from a real air horn. If you're looking for a horn to replace a broken OEM horn, this will do pretty good. It is easier to install than an air horn, because there's no compressor, tanks or tubes. However, the trade off is it's not a super-impressive horn."
1,WEAK...DON'T BUY,"Looks good mounted, but a weak horn that's not worth the cost. As the old saying goes... ""u get what u pay for"""
2,Not Very Loud,"This horn set is HUGE, I have a Toyota Corolla, and had to squeeze these horns in the engine firewall. Installation was a pain in the @$$. In addition, these horns were only marginally louder than my existing wimpy factory horn. The advert claimed that the horns were 118 decibels, I would certainly disagree with that! Disappointed, would never buy or recommend."
2,Complete waste of time,"Due to the lack of PSAT prep books out on the market (most books are SAT and PSAT in one, lacking the writing section), i was ecstatic when i found this book, after all, the title is PSAT success... so i thought it would help me score well.big mistake. there is probably 2 or 3 pages of review on each section, and only a short list of common errors (such as ""do not use him and me want to go play"") in writing. most of the errors are obvious and the list does NOT help at all. it doesn't even help you through the book exercise! i saw only about 15 pages of ""teaching"" material in the book and lots of error-filled practices.only on the last page did i see that the peterson success series are for people who already know all the material and only want a some practice.boooo! if i had wanted this kind of ""review"" i would have gotten the free ETS PSAT booklet from my guidance counselor... they're practically the same. boo!"
3,Please please telephone.,"Two songs from Ringo's albumTime Takes Time, plus a cover of an Elvis Presley classic. Nothing special."
5,The Chinese Bandit,"This book makes me really want to travel. Being a citizen of the world, I found this book to be well written and a very exciting book. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in exotic places and/or travelling."
1,Picture is misleading,"Pay close attention to the written dimensions because the picture is very, very misleading. The picture suggests that the height and depth are somewhat equivalent (to form a triangle with close to equal A/B dimensions). In fact, the A=13"" and the B=3.5"". Hence, the item is much smaller than the picture suggests. The quality of the object is good -- just small."
4,jarlduke,"Well...everyone has their own taste, but you just have to love at least one if these three CD`s..."
3,Confusing info,"I think that these may be the filters I am looking for, but the product description is so confusing, I cannot bring myself to order it. The picture shows one round filter and one square filter. The diemnsions are listed as 7"" by 9"", I think. What is that describing? Can you help me please?"
2,NOT as pictured,"Not worth returning it, and it should work OK, but do note that the item is pictured distinctly different to the item delivered. Just the filter, period, no ""housing"" as pictured. Misleading, but, as I said, not enough of a pain to return it. I'll fabricate the housing easily enough and know to not order anything from this seller in the future.________________________________N.B. edited out a typo."
1,doesn't fit,"Add claimed that it fit the style of kitchen composter we have, but alas it does not. I don't know who measures these things but they are way off."
3,compost filter,"The photo w/this ad should have tipped me off, but I thought I might be receiving the metal part shown. I rec'd 2 filters - one round filter that is a little small for my counter top composter that has no holder as shown; and one square filter that doesn't fit my composter..."
5,Works well,We put every thing that can be composted intothe keeper and it is days sometimes before wecan empty it. This does a good job of keepingthe odor in the can and not seeping out into thekitchen.
4,Fantastic,"The only issue I have with this item is that I will have to replace at some point. It works like no other and I am completely satisfied with it. It is not expensive, easily purchased and works!"
5,compost filter,Excellent value for this product. The under counter compost keeper has been a great help in holding our vegtable waste until we can transport it to the backyard compost pile. Highly recommend this compost system.
1,not the real thing,These filters do not work and do not come properly packaged. Do not buy from this seller. These must be fake imitations because they don't keep any smell out of the Compost Keeper. I am replacing these with the ones recommended from the Norpro Compost Keeper. What a disappointment!
5,Absolutely exquisite,"I have many CDs of piano music, but Pianissimo is one of my favorites. The music swells and flows joyously over you, lifting and relaxing you."
5,Energizing,"It's rare to find a CD that has energy but is calming at the same time. I think Ms. Ciani does this very well. The music is very flowing and peaceful, but there's a moving energy through the different pieces that keeps you from zoning out. She's an accomplished artist, and I enjoyed this CD very much. I'm looking forward to purchasing another by her."
3,Great CD Unplayable DVD,"If you like Motorhead, this is a great CD. If your looking for the video of their 25th anniversary concert, keep looking. The DVD is Region 0 and PAL so it won't play on U.S. DVD players or T.V.'s. The package is great and features some good pictures of the show."
1,Move on to another book.,"I found this book to be rather dry and lifeless. Being a Christian, this book left an unsettling taste in my mouth. I found many biblical inconsistencies. .... It certainly was not the most amazing book that I have ever read and it certainly did not leave me speechless. .... Instead, I highly recommend the books, ""My descent into death and the message of love which brought me back"" by Howard Storm and the book, ""Returned from Tomorrow"" by George G. Ritchie."
5,Wow!!,"This is the most awesome fragrance a man can wear...it screams irresistable!!! You just have to try it, there is nothing else like it. Thanks again Amazon...I ordered it on Wednesday and recieved it on Friday, and what a bargain at this price plus it is hard to find in stores. Thank you Amazon!!"
4,I'm Happy,"Nice fragrance. Classic. A light, airy, fruity oriental -- kinda like one of those orange creamsicles you savored as a kid, but this scent isn't childish. Good for summer or winter. Good staying power. I wear it especially when I need to lift my spirits."
5,Great Disney Family Film,"I just recently bought a copy of this movie @ a video rental store that was going out of business.I popped it into the VCR thinking that it was going to be one of those regular old Disney films like A Tiger Walks. I was surprised it is one of the best early Disney films that i have ever seen. It is about a group of poor french children who have a toy horse that they love dearly. Well one day the head falls off why they are playing with it and they have the kindly fixer fix it for them. But they don't know that there was a key that they put in the head. Well a group of crooks had just stolen 400,000 pounds from the French bank. And that key was the key to the warehouse where the Money is in. Well the crooks will do anything to get that key back. Even commit Murder! Well the kids save the day as they do in all of the Disney films. And the crooks are taken off to jail. Great Disney film."
2,"Nice , but...","If you believe that you are getting a book where you will SEE illustrations of many, or even about 10%, of the superheros that there are info/articles on...think again. You may, or may not, read about your favorites and learn some interesting facts, but, you will not see them. Bizarre for a book on a very visual medium. As to the selection of superheroes and the (dis)proportionate length of some articles...well, call it author's choice...or bias. A tad light on the founding fathers, so to speak, of the 1940's. I am immediately selling mine."
1,Good but not great,"Was it just me or did anyone else notice a lot of spelling errors in the book? Also under Greatest American Hero they called Robert Culp's character John Mackie and in the show he was called Bill Maxwell. Things like that bothered me and this is no way an ""Ultimate Encyclopedia"". They hardly touched on comic book characters like: Grendel, Whisper, American Flagg. Really a disappointing book."
2,not what i expected for,"First of all i was looking for a book that describes each super heroe's style, character, super powers in detail, even i expected a scala or a chart showing his/her powers, intelligence, agility, dexterity out of say, 10 or 100 what ever. But none is available, just a brief explanation of how he /she is created, and etc. No description of his/her adventures, friends, the very popular speciality etc.I bought this book with 2 other books ""The comic book encyclopedia"" (ron goulart) and ""500 comic book villains"" (Baron's production) and none of them satisfied me.However only book which provides all superheroes with ""pictures"" is ""The comic book encyclopedia"" (ron goulart)this and the other book doesnt even provide picture for all characters but some mostly known ones.i dont recommend this product for those who is familiar with the super heroes but to those who knows nothing about comics."
5,A fine companion volume using the same A-Z reference format,"Gina Misiroglu works with David A. Roach on THE SUPERHERO BOOK: THE ULTIMATE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF COMIC-BOOK ICONS AND HOLLYWOOD HEROES, which provides a fine companion volume using the same A-Z reference format and surveying all significant characters in almost 300 alphabetically indexed entries. Together these are key references for any comprehensive cartoon or comic library holding, accenting histories with a peppering of color and black and white illustrations from source materials.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
2,Poor Quality Reporduction,"This is a poorly reproduced copy of the original Air Force Survival Guide.I though I was ordering the heavy cover and heavy/water resistant version that the Air Force issued in years past.I was very surprised to find that it is a poor quality copy printed on low bond paper. About the thickness of a Jepp plate, or for those not familiar with Jeppesen Plates, it is a couple of steps above toilet paper. So do get it near water or this manual is done for. In retrospect, I wished I had not wasted the money."
4,very chocolaty,"these are very chocolaty without being cloyingly sweet However, I would have like a little more rum taste."
3,What Mystery?,"The only reason I gave this three stars was because I liked the character Dido and her father Barnabas. The other characters were two dimensional at best and the mystery was non-existent. Everybody has one book in a series that falls flat, so I will try another to see if the characterization and the mystery get better."
4,Smoke Screen,"Good insight into the perils and tribulations of a single mother with a witty, protective dad and then, with all of that she solves a rather unique and interesting crime. With a ""locked door"" scene no less. My interest in the antique book world led me to read it, my interest in the author and her books will lead me to the rest of her works."
1,Irrelevant,Anyone undertaking the writing of such a book must be either boring or unhinged. Reading this book is excellent before bedtime if you are an insomniac.
3,Good Book . . . But Not Complete.,"This book has alot of information on tours, recordings, etc., but it is NOT complete. I saw Johnny Cash perform at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas (I still have the advertisement) on March 26, 1988, and it is not listed in the book. I very much remember the show because he was ill and took requests from the audience. It was the only time (from 1985-94) I heard him sing ""A Boy Named Sue"" live. It was also brought to everyone's attention by Cash that Col. Tom Parker was in attendance.I'm sure it would be very difficult for the author to list ""everything"" on Johnny Cash, so keep that in mind if you purchase."
4,hardcore/death/melody,"from members of at the gates(one of the best death-melodycore)comes another swedish thrash death metal with blitzing riffs and fast paced drumming. more hardcore than at the gates, but still puninshing none the less. if you love at the gates,defleshed or hatebreed you most probably like this album."
4,"If you like old-school Slayer or Sepultura, you will probably like this","The riffs (and even the exact note choices/fret numbers) are so reminiscent of old Slayer and Sepultura (Arise/ChaosAD-era) that if you like either of those bands, there's a good chance you'd like this. Just good plain evil-sounding thrash metal. The vocals are a bit repetitive (virtue of the metalcore sound) but that's about the only downside IMO to an otherwise great album. Also check out Himsa..."
1,The Haunted Didn't Make Me Do It,"Update (6/13/2006)I am re-visiting this review to make it more accurate. About a year after picking up this album, I began to get into bands such as In Flames, Arch Enemy, Dark Tranquility, Children of Bodom, etc. Looking back, I would rate this release at least a 4, as there are many great tracks. I don't think I appreciated how simple the Haunted kept it; thrash is thrash. If it is good, it doesn't need to be that genre-shifting or mind-bending. Its just good music!OriginalWhat a waste of polycarbonate. I had heard a great buzz about this disc: online reviews, metal forums, even some VJ on MTV2 was sporting their T-shirt. So I picked it up with eager anticipation. Its true; if you want a re-hash of old testament with some low-end growling and a boring drummer, this is the album for you. If you want something truly innovative, pick up some Nothingface. Aren't there any more brutally heavy groups that still strive to evolve metal?"
5,"GREAT BUY, YOU CANT GO WRONG","The haunted made me do it is the second album to be done by the haunted. aside from minor lineup changes the haunted are back with a new singer and drummer. The singing is killer, the drums are killer, the guitars are flat out amazing. If you like At the gates, cradle of filth, in flames, or witchery I highly reccomend that you buy this CD. If you like Thrash you cant go wrong with this metal gift from god"
3,"Good tool, incorrect pictures and description","Please read the full description and know the facts before buying this item! What you see in the pictures (as of August 2011) is not what you get. Furthermore, there really aren't as many accessories included as you might think.There is no handy case, as the pictures might suggest. Also, 20 of the 27 accessories are heavy cutoff wheels. The two clamps are good quality clamps.I was torn between giving this 5 stars and giving this 1 star, so split the difference."
3,Misleading...,"I try to always do my research before purchasing online, and in this case, I thought I had.The product description clearly states ""Rotary tool includes 30 accessories to perform wide variety of tasks""What I received was:2 clamps,4 sanding drums and the shaft to hold them,20 cut-off discs and the shaft to hold them.THAT'S IT!Could someone please enlighten me as to ""the wide variety of tasks"" one could do with only sanding drums and cut-off discs?As for the tool itself, I have no problem- I understand that it won't accept 3/32"" Dremel bits.My advice is to skip the disappointment of this package and buy just the tool alone, then the accessories you want, separately."
5,Top tool!,"Great value for money,has good torque and is easy to use. We use it for hobby jewellry making and it does every thing we want it to do."
5,Gift for my son.,This was Christmas gift for my son. He seems to think it is great for the kind of work he doe's. He has had no problems so far and the price was right and he liked the fact that it had a plug in wire instead of batteries which run down real fast when you are doing a job.
2,Speed Dial Problem Right out of the Box,"Speed dial was really hard to move right out of the box so I returned it and got a dremel. Dremel was more expensive but really happy I did, more versatile as well."
2,Missing Parts,"Box and listing advertised 30 accessories, but mine did not have all the accessories. The only items in the box was the rotary tool, bag, clamps, discs, round sanders (3), but nothing else. If everything had accompanied the item as listed I may be able to increase my rating, but, it wasn't and I can't."
2,UGH!!!!!!,"I am not sure who is at fault here ...or if it's a case of false advertising...BUT we ordered this and it came fairly quickly which was nice, however, there were a few pieces missing. I returned the item (to the tune of $13 in shipping). On the very same day the new one came...(Like quick quick) but again MISSING 3 PIECES!!!!!!Plan on contacting Black and Decker next...How disappointing...AN ADDED NOTE...be very careful if you decide to order this item anyway... I have contacted B & D and it hasn't been that pretty! They are no longer making this item with the accessories and in order to get the missing pieces I have to wait till they manufacture them again, not knowing how long it'll be....I find this amazing for such a well known, large company. On the up side.....you can use the Dremel acc. parts with this model."
1,Case Shown NOT Included,I seems like a decent tool but if you are going to prominently advertise that it comes with a nice carrying case then it really should come with that carrying case - especially when the main display photo is of that carrying care.
3,The description is not correct,"I received this item and noticed that the box labeled RTX-6 actually contained an RTX-3 (their discontinued model). It doesn't seem like there is a lot of difference between the two, but the box and description should match what you are getting."
1,NO SOFT-sided bag with accessory compartment! DONT BUY FROM THIS PLACE,"Amazon is selling this Black&Decker product and in the descrition is says that it comes with a soft-sided bag with accessory compartment. It is a lie, it comes with a normal bag...not like the one in the picture. Since I don't like scams of any kind, I would not recommend to buy from this pace anymore."
3,SO Disappointed,"I was really excited to receive my rotary tool today; in fact, I paid the extra money for one-day delivery because I wanted to be able to use it before I had to return to work this week. It did arrive the very next day after ordering, but I was very disappointed with what was in the box. As other reviewers have mentioned, many of the accessories are missing. The reason I paid the extra money for this version of the rotary tool was specifically for the carving accessories that it was supposed to come with. If you haven't noticed, the same tool is available for several dollars less from another seller. Learn from my mistake and order the cheaper tool and buy your accessories separately - at least then you can be sure of what you're getting.P.S. The rotary tool itself seems to work fine."
2,Rotary Too.s,I was very impressed when I first got the unit. It out performed the previous dremmel uint. It was easier to handle and would perform very good. After about 3 weeks of heavy use the unit stopped. We will see if the first was just a dud. I have replaced it.
3,Black and Decker Rotary Tool,"The product itself is fine however the photo and the advertisement of multiple accessories was misleading. The 20 plus accesories were only multiple sanding discs however you were lead to believe they were additional bits. As for the carrying case, as you can see from the photo and what you got were totally different. What you see on the photo is a carrycase that folded, what I got was a vinyl pouch."
1,Cheap. Incomplete.,"The set was incomplete, the collet was jammed into the collet nut so it wouldnt come out, and the accessories didnt even fit the collet. not to mention the flimsy plastic parts! disappointed yet again with Black & Decker."
2,Like of sucked,"Not very powerful and basicallu underwhelming, the motor smelled like it was burning within 30 seconds of using it. Basically was pretty useless"
3,great tool and compatible with dremel,"The rtx has even more torque than the dremel 4000. I have both but I think the RTX is a steal.The 2 biggest problems with the RTX is 1) the collet/chuck that is included is hard to remove after use 2) the speed dial is too narrow. (just turn slowly)Other than that, it is good to use with the XPR planer, multisaw and all dremel accessories and attachments."
3,Rotary tools are fun,"I did not buy this tool for myself, it was a gift. The person who received it is very pleased with the performance. I have one of my own and like towork(play) with it."
3,Great Product,"Great product, works better than my dad's dremol does. Only complaint is the case (or lack thereof) - there IS NO CASE just to be clear, and also, just to be clear, the ""accessories"" are sparse - a sanding thing, and some cutting wheels, and.... well, that's it. And the sanding bands fell apart - I think it may be the humidity or something, though the separate accessories I'd ordered didn't have the same issue."
2,Not as pictured,Picture shows a case for the tool and parts what was actually included was a cheap crappy drawstring bag.Might as well throw everything in a WalMart sack.What a rip off.
4,"Buzz, buzz!",Haven't used it yet but seems OK. The speed change control wheel is a little hard to turn.
5,Black and Decker RTX-6 review,This rotary tool is as good as my Dremel and in someways better. Its easy to change assessories and it has power to share. the handle is well shaped for good control and the price is very reasonable for the quality of the tool.
3,"Caution: 1/8"" is smallest shaft","Not bad for the price, but nothing special either. The smallest bit shaft that this will hold is 1/8"" while many Dremel bits have 3/32"" shafts. The 3/32"" shafts will not work in this rotary tool. Also note that about 26 of the ""30 Accessories"" are small sanding/grinding disks."
1,Listed Picture Doesn't Match What You Receive With Order,"Buyer beware, this item doesn't come with the carry/pack case listed in the sellers picture for this item. You need to scroll waaaayyy down to read ""what's in the box"" and you'll find that you get some flimsy nylon storage bag.The dremmel works fine, but preferred the carry case pictured in the add. Pretty crappy bait served up!"
4,More Power for Less Green,"Pros (vs. the Dremel brand):-much cheaper (the comparable Dremel model runs about $60 to $90)-decent carrying case-doesn't heat up as fast (especially on the middle speed settings)-the Flip-Lock system is not only safer, but you only need one hand, and you don't end up removing the whole collet housing every time you want to change attachments-hand grip at the front of the tool allows for greater precision in detailing, etc.- tough clamps- nice warrantyCons- the accessories are a little cheap (the collet wrench is great though) and the set only comes with the large size collet (but with all the money you save on the unit, you can buy tons of extra stuff. And Dremel parts fit if you get the right collet size)"
5,Now Thats What I Call A Manga!!!!,"This manga is really good!!! Lots of demon action!!! I love it!!!! If your looking for a manga with action, demons, BLOOD ^_^, a bit of comedy, and hot guys get this!!!!!"
1,If you're dumb enough to believe this is a duck hat...,...I have some swamp land I'd like to talk to you about.
3,"Good book, bad Kindle version","I like the book, but the Kindle version has many typos.It was a bit disappointing and frustrating to come across so many typos and errors within a book that I feel is so important.I feel like I got the shaft from Amazon...(and I paid much more than $3.99 at the time that I bought it)"
4,Decent Motorcycle Horn,Louder and more reliable than my stock horn was. Fairly small so fits in easily.
5,good horn for the price,"louder than my stock KTM horn and my Yamaha v-star horn. it is not ""way louder"" but a nice horn for the price, easy to hook up and fit in the stock location on my KTM 625."
5,cheaper price,I saw this at wal-mart for 100 dollars. dont waste you money buyin it for 140. you should be able to find it cheaper just about anyplace else.
5,A Great System,"This system is very good for the money you spend, and one of the best features, as stated above, is the Gameport. It also has a sweet look, even if it is a little big. The 5 disk changer gives you plenty of room to shuffle your favorite CDs. The only trouble I've had with it is getting yelled at for having it too loud. Overall, a great buy."
1,this is crap,I think for the money you spend on this I think its crap. The sound quality is horrible compared to the JVC gigatube stereo. iT may be a little bit more money but its worth it. Its not to much more money at all.The size is ridiculous to. Its way to big for crap. It does not need to be that massive. Philips is also not a great quality. I personally like JVC better.
4,Possibly Yanni's best original release,"Most of Yanni's releases before this CD were compilations of earlier works. This was his first all new work in quite a while. And I still consider it his best work to date. This CD contains most of the pieces used in his ""Live at the Acropolis"". The ""Live"" CD and Video have a better performance of these pieces however, because of the added instrumentation. But in the realm of his non-live recordings, this is his best."
5,Perfect!,I am truely moved by this CD. Words cannot express how it makes you feel - perfect is as close as I can come.Dare to Dream - then Soar!Diana
3,Good sized picture book,"Pages are big pictures with one word text next to an object. Apple, airplane, bicycle, boat, etc. Nice feature, 2 books in one. 1st half, abc, 2nd half 1,2,3. I wish there were more words for the neglected letters q,u,v,x,y,z. I liked that the pages where completely colored. No blank areas. Good sized book. All the characters show up in the book, plus a few more which I liked. There is no set theme or story, just the alpha and numbers. Good for little ones that just are learning objects and pointing to them. I enjoy that with my 19 month old son."
3,"Elmo on cover, but not in book","This book is fine, but I bought it in part because Elmo is on the cover, however, I don't think he is actually inside the book at all (I didn't look on every page, but if he's there, it's minimal compared to the other characters). Book didn't interest my daughter as much as some of the other elmo books we have (lift the flap ones and elmo's big word book)"
4,Good choice - just not for a toddler,"My daughter just turned 1. She's a big fan of Sesame Street and books. I wanted to purchase a book for her that would provide many colorful pictures, but also begin to incorporate learning words and the alphabet.My mistake was thinking that I could give this to her for her 1st birthday. I've put the book up, and we look at it together occassionally. Books with standard weight pages are just not an option at this point - that is if we want to keep the book longer than a week.I look forward to pulling this out in a year or so. I think that she'll really enjoy it."
3,"Somewhat disappointed, but kept it.","For the price, $50, I feel the quality of this product is marginal. True, it's all-metal construction, but I don't agree with the previous reviewer's description of it as ""very heavy."" I would describe it as light-guage, with somewhat crude workmanship. The top fits, but barely. However, the basic functionality is there, and it doesn't look bad on the countertop, so I'm going to try to use it."
5,Attention Ry Cooder Fans!,"The other reviews here have covered how good this album is, and I concur. Most tracks sound like they could be on a Ry Cooder album like ""Chicken Skin Music"". That makes sense, since Cooder and his typical recording pals (David Lindley and Jim Keltner) appear on most of the cuts.Beautiful stuff, music that transcends categorization. You are short-changing yourself if you think of this LP as merely ""Hawaiian Music"". Folk, rock, blues, island, all sorts of influences going on here."
1,Correction Needed,"After trying over and over to CONTACT you, I finally decided to write a review and see if a person reads it and will catch the correction you need at the site with the ThePahinui Bros. album with John Lennon's Jealous Guy on it. You've misspelled it as ""Lealous Guy.""If a person reads this first, there is no reason to post this as a review, just change the listing to match the description you have for it.STEVE"
4,"""Good 80's Horror!""","Gary Busey, Corey Haim, Megan Follows and Everett McGillstar in this 1985 horror film based on Stephen King's book.A crippled boy discovers that a town's killer is a werewolf.I've always liked this film and glad to have it on dvd thathas decent picture and sound, but no extras. I recommendthis good 80's horror film."
5,Narration,I give this movie 4 stars. In my opinion Silver Bullet would not have been as successful had it not been for the narrator's compelling voice. Her voice immediately insensed viewing interest.It was a brilliant idea to have Marty's sister narrate the story and loaded with a fine cast the movie couldn't help but be a winner. Two thumps to Stephen King for the Narrational idea.
3,Pretty good...for a werewolf flick.,"A killer is stalking Tarker's Mills, and only Corey Haim, his sister Megan Follow and Uncle Gary Busey know its a werewolf. This Stephen King adaptation (From his own script, which is actually longer than the novellete its based on) has a lot of silly moments and weak make-up effects, but it's largely entertaining with a nice sense of humor and good chemistry between the aforementioned leads. Nothing great, but it's recommended."
3,Good,"I watched this movie when I was younger and I enjoyed it. I recently watched it again and I didnt enjoy it to much. Good story, nice setting, cool werewolf, but it lacked something. I know add your comments or vote that its not helpful but it was alright. Not Kings best film."
5,I Just LOVE Good Werewolf Movies!!!,"I have a particular interest in Werewolves as my Mother comes from the Black Forest in Germany where the Legend Of The Werewolf originated. In this movie Corey Haim plays a physically challeged young guy who becomes aware of the evil doings of a Werewolf in his small New England town. He is helped by his oft married and hard drinking Uncle Red, played by Garey Busey in yer another fine performance. This is a very entertaining movie and as Corey says in the movie ""' Here's one for the Good Guys!!!"""
5,Classic Stephen King!,"This was a great movie!I love the DVD,my only complaint is the mono sound.I wish they could of remaster the sound to 5.1 surround.And it would also of been nice to see some Special features.Interview with the cast or Stephen King.But this a Paramount DVD,old horror movies they dont seem to care about.But they must care for this movie,since they are doing a Silver Bullet part 2.It's on the countingdown.com list of upcoming movies.Another Warewolf is Attacking Tarkersmill,who is it this time?Is it the revrends replacement?Town Doctor?Or maby a house wife? I hope 2 does happen?If not a 2 how about a remake?"
4,Based on Stephen King novella,"This is an adaptation of Stephen King's novella, 'Cycle of the Werewolf'. It unfolds like a campfire story about a town terrorized by a werewolf. The only one who gets close to solving the mystery of who the creature is by day is a young boy in a wheelchair. The boy is soon hunted once the werewolf realizes he knows his human identity. The movie is a bit hokey in places, especially since the special effects are not advanced, but the toned down graphics makes it more suitable for younger teens to view. Almost reminds me of a 'Goosebumps' tale.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
5,AWSOME!!!!,"I love this movie! Even though it was made in the 80's...Well I think that the werewolf looks totally cool! Why do I love the looks of this werewolf,i'll tell you, The werewolf does not look like a bear!(like the raly old werewolf movies.) It has a long snout like a,well..a wolf! And it has AWSOME face expressions! Well,if you LOVE werewolf movies (like I do!) Than buy Steven King's The Silver Bullet!"
5,AAAHHHH !,"I want to make this clear !.To those who are familiar with the current trend in horror,this movie may be too childish ..but when we watch movies which used to scare us when we were kids it is nothing but a great pleasure.This movie frightened me likeanything especially the scenes in which Brady and Tammy get ""torn to pieces"" by the Werewolf.This movie is an adaptation from the Stephen King's ""Cycle of the Werewolf""..Butcertain hallmarks of King such as the origin of the evil and it's reason for killing etc..are missing ,neverthless it is a treat .To movie each movie has something to say or conversely I watch movies which have something to say...In this movie one can find,as in most of the SK's novels,a crippled boy fighting and finally beating the Werewolf inspite of all the difficulties!Anyway to sum up,this movie is a wonderful treat for those love1970's horror movies.."
4,"Fun werewolf yarn, courtesy of Stephen King","Horror maestro Stephen King adapted the script for Silver Bullet from his more superior novella Cycle of the Werewolf, but in the end, this film is a fun yarn in the werewolf horror genre, even though it doesn't measure up at all to other films like the original Howling and An American Werewolf in London. A young Corey Haim plays a wheelchair bound teen, who along with his beer swigging uncle (Gary Busey, perfectly cast), are on the trail of a blood thirsty werewolf who is making mince meat out of the townsfolk. While it's pretty obvious who the werewolf is, and the makeup and effects haven't aged well at all, Silver Bullet is still a fun romp that King fans and horror fans will get a kick out of."
5,Great Werewolf Movie.,"Corey Haim plays a wheel chair bound young hero, named Marty. He has a custom built motorized chair, made by his uncle. The chair looks more like a motorcycle than a wheelchair, and drives about as fast.The Werewolf terrorizes the whole town, killing Marty's best friend and driving his girlfriend out of town.The towns folk are helpless against it, and the police refuse to believe it's a Werewolf.Marty is the first to see the Werewolf and live. He then goes on to discover the Were's human identity. United with his uncle and sister, Marty has a powerful climatic battle against the beast - armed with a single Silver Bullet."
4,on the edge chiller,saw this picture years ago and still like it just as much today as than.a very good chiller for the hole family
2,A far howl from other werewolf films.,"If the director's intent was to frighten the audience, he came up short. The werewolf in this film looked like a skinny bear. Other than Evertt McGill's creepy performance and the well-orchestrated church metamorphosis scene, fans of monster movies could do much better as far as entertainment goes by renting ""An American Werewolf in London"" and horror by renting ""The Howling."""
3,"lacks the ""bite"" of a good werewolf movie","i like this movie,but to be honest i can't give this 5 stars,and three may be to much! really all ""bark"" and no bite(oh the bad pun) this one just doesn't live up to the standerds of a classic werewolf movie. some great quiet moments between the three leads,but when the wolf who you will spot a mile away) comes on screen this starts to lose ground! an ok movie but not worth paying much for it!"
2,Very scary! But could have been better. A lot Better!,"This movie was one stupid movie. The plot and story stunk. Every part of the movie was a complete blow off. But. .it was scary. It really kept me up all night thinking about it. I think it was the music that really added to the movie. It gives you a very erie feeling. The special effects were horrible. Anybody can see, that it was a man in a dog costume. But if you want to watch a very scary film on Halloween night, this is the one to watch. But, I think An American Werewolf In London is the real one you should buy. I've made a review for that one too. This one, was scary, but stupid!"
1,Sliver Bullet Gets No Silver Medal,"Silver Bullet had no decent special effects until the very last few scenes, where Marty and Uncle Red confront the werewolf. The part where the werewolf makes its final lunge after being shot was the scariest scene there!Tha acting in this movie made it quite unenjoyable. The people would stand there looking bored with life until they were decapitated, and THEN they would yell and scream. I do not reccomend watching this movie. As most Stephen King movies turn out, it looks better on paper than film."
1,This Just SUCKS!,What the hell is this crap? A kid in a wheelchair outrunning a werewolf?! I think not! And that dumb souped up bike thing. And the preist is a werewolf?! God...Teen Wolf with Michael J. fox was scarier!Spend your horror bucks someplace else. This just sucks.
2,Not Scary At All,"This movie wasn't scary at all. Usually, Stephen King movies are much better than this. Watch a different one. We wanted something much more thrilling, and we are wimpy about scary movies."
2,Horrid costume,"Interesting storyline with some possiblities, but the werewolf looks like a bear. I mean a tall black bear walking around upright. Horrid, 2 stars."
4,Super Scary,"This movie was really scary. It got really bad reviews, and I don't understand why. True, there is a little bit of gore in it at the beginning, but so what. Really well done.Hurricane22,Amateur Movie Critic"
2,Lame,It was more funny than scary. I was very disappointed. I am sure the book is good (I never read it) but the movie is cheaply done and the plot is predictable.
4,THE BEST KING ADAPTION SINCE THE SHINING!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Silver bullet is so utterly predictable....But thats what makes it such an amazing film. In the horror market, werewolf movies suck real bad. The only other good werewolf film that is really worth checking out is American Werewolf in London. Silver Bullet really keeps the genre alive with its glory. gary Busey was perfectly casted as Uncle Red. Corey Haim gives his only good performance (and the only one I can stand). Its a good King adaption. Most of King's adaptions are TERRIBLE but this one is perfect......almost!"
4,"Another tour de force from the ""King""","That is the kind of movie I really enjoy. Maybe I will sound a little odd by saying that, but Silver Bullet is quite a touching horror movie.I say touching because it is not only the story of a werefolf, it is also the story of a charming boy in a wheelchair, who unexpectedly meets the werewolf, and throughout the rest of the film, gets chased by him. But lucky boy (Corey Haim), has the help of his sister and doubting uncle.Once again Stephen King really gets to grab us by the inside with this entetaining ride of chills. I loved everything about this story. The setting in a small town, people knowing each other, people uniting together ( to try to hunt the killer), The music by Jay Underwood ( I think). The darkness of the picture, the cold evenings outside, everything is perfectly set to make this movie one of the best werewolf movies.The story is based on Stephen King's novelette called :""The Cycle Of The Werewolf."" Lucky me, I found myself a copy."
4,HEART-STOPPINGLY SCARY,"The film speeds along at a cracking pace, from the greusome start to the ""I can't look, is IT in the house yet,"" end. This is complete cuddle up on the sofa and bring your cushion horror, with lots of humor too. Thoroughly recommended. Don't forgt your wolfsbane!"
4,Vishal Shekhar have done it again,"Another top bill by Vishal Shekhar. YOu can feel several influences in the music and ""sajna se vaari"" is a very good rendition.It is time India recognizes their talent and move beyond Himesh Reshammiya."
4,Very well constructed baffels,Very pleased. A good addition to my stereo in my 07.5 Dodge pickup. Good construction as advertised. Cost effective. Way to to XTC. These baffles fit the opening very well. Will recommend.
5,Bev Dillon rules! Superior quality video and worth every penny and more!,"Full of excellent techniques and tips, far superior in quality, content and value for the money than any other videos by other experts! This lady knows HOW TO TEACH so that everything is crystal clear with distinct narration and it covers far more than other knitting videos. Some of these other knitting or crochet experts out there are very good at designing but cannot clearly show and teach the techniques. Not so with Bev's videos. I use her videos for my students for reference while I am unavailable/out of town. They are ecstatic about them, just as I am! You will really be impressed and very satisfied with the value and quality of her videos! She has a superb crochet video additionally!"
3,Knitting Video Review,"Anyone could learn to knit from this video. But, the picture qulity is rather poor. It's just very outdated looking. I'm donating mine to the library."
5,No More Trial & Error Knitting!,"I have used this video for ten years and just ordered one as a gift for my daughter's friend. I was an experienced knitter when I purchased the first video for myself, however, Bev's direct demonstration combined with her very easily understood narrative gave me the confidence to move into the arena of advanced knitting. I have now completed numerous garments and other articles using the video as a reference. This video is a supurb teaching/learning tool! Very well done! Very complete! Very valuable reference! Both the photography and voice instructions are presented in a most understandable manner. Thanks!"
4,Just what I needed,"I haven't finshed watching the whole video but what I've seen has been very helpful. Yes, it's boring but I expected it to be boring -- it's a video about knitting, after all! But what I've seen so far has been very instructive and things I didn't know how to do before I now can do. The one drawback I found was that she uses a knitting style that is foreign to me so either I must relearn her style (not sure I'm going to do that) or I must continue to translate her left-handed knitting in my brain to my right-handed style. But overall I thought this was a great buy."
3,"Good info, but boring to watch...","Sorry, I realize this lady has lots of experience, but she's far too dull to watch. I am a self-taught knitter who has been knitting for years, so I was hoping to pick up some good informtion. Unfortunately, this DVD is so dated, watching her is like a shot of Prozac. In addition, the DVD quality is poor, very grainy as though too many copies have been made from the original. Camera angles of her knitting the garments could have been better. There is great website out there for beginning knitters, (knittinghelp.com) with short videos to show you certain techniques -- and for free. No nonsense with very clear instructions. This one, unfortunately will have to back."
1,"boring, lousy and not very good.","Someone sent me this DVD because they knew I liked kntting DVDs and had learnt to knit from THE ART OF KNITTING. This was a real let down. Sooooo boring, the woman's voice really grates on you and there's nothing exciting or differrent about the teaching method. If you want to learn to knit or if your an advanced knitter and want to learn some new stitches buy THE ART OF KNITTING it's a much better DVD because it has so much in it like a state by state directory of yarn stores and knit shops, a library of knit books you might want to buy, a stitch library and cute little stories on yarn and wool. This DVD pales in comparison thE THE ART OF KNITTING and it's way more expensive."
3,"Old School, Grandma Type Instruction, but Gives U a basic foundation for knitting","This dvd will help novice knitters. It gives you the basic knitting foundation with a grandma type of feel. There are absolutely no bells and whitles on this dvd --infact it seems it was originally recorded on VHS or beta (ha-ha!) and the production crew coverted it to dvd. What I'm trying to say is, this dvd was way too expensive for the quality of the dvd. Now, if you can get passed that, it is good for establishing basic knitting skills. The one BIG negative though is the instructor prefers Continental Knitting and most of her knitting examples use Continental method instead of American/Throw method. She does begin the video with American, but all of the projects use Continental. One should know that before shelling out the bucks for this dvd."
3,Don't watch this video if you are tired.,"If you are tired, this video will put you to sleep. No offense to Bev, but the quality and speed at which this video moves is poor. The picture is fuzzy and the colors are not good. I am sure her talent as a knitter is excellent, but this is a very over-priced video. Maybe all of this is due to the date it was copyrighted, the video is over 10 years old. I gave this video a high rating at 3 because, like I said, I am sure she is talented, but the video isn't."
3,Misses The Mark,"Although the instructor tries very hard to be clear, simple and explicit, she introduces some terms early-on that later create confusion and are not relevant (in my opinion). Some camera angles fail to clearly show some of the crucial stitches."
5,I found the book Informative and Helpful.,"The dietary changes recommended, while not a cure, did help alleviate a good bit of my pain. I found the explanation of the role of essential fatty acids fascinating. It doesn't work overnight, but implementing them for a good month helped me with cramping and bloating that I continued to have after my surgery."
4,Natural Treatment of Fibroids and Endometriosis,"I find the book to be very informative. It has plain and simple as well as easy to follow tips. Also, it helps you understand what is happening and why."
4,A Very Interesting Mix,"Working with Shankar in the 60's is what inspired Glass to move in the musical direction for which he became famous. On this recording Glass arranges 3 Shankar compositions and Shankar arranges 3 Glass compositions. Some pieces use the conventional orchestra, others have tablas, sitars, and vocals. It's all good."
1,Where is Ravi Shankar's Influence?,"I forgot that I really don't like this sort of music from Philip Glass. I do, however, love Ravi Shankar. I was looking for something a little less frenetic!! Oh well!"
3,Try a blend of Ganges and Mississippi Delta...,"if you liked this CD, I honestly think you'll be even more impressed by the collaboration between Ry Cooder and Vishwa Mohan Bhatt (A Meeting By The River). Ry Cooder's blues slide guitar provides some fine enhancements to classical Indian music.This work by Ravi Shankar and Phillip Glass only just combines popular Indian vernacular with some touches of western classical. I expected much more from Ravi Shankar, given his experience playing with western jazz and fusion artists.But I guess, usually, the end result is more a reflection of western musicians' ability to work with Indian musicians' (harmonic-harmonic scale)."
4,More Glass than Shankar,"This is a very good CD, and I think how much you like it may depend upon if you like Glass music more than Shankar music, or if you are not a sitar fan or not a minimalism fan (but why get the CD if that is the case.) That is, the composing credits show 1/2 the pieces are written by Glass and 1/2 by Shankar, but there seems to be a more western than eastern sensibility to each piece, to such a degree that without looking at the credits, I would think each piece was written by Glass, with some sitar accompaniment thrown in on the side. I really like this CD because I really do like Phillip Glass, and I am only holding back one star because I had expectations that there would be an absolutely magical melding of two partners in some type of exact half and half musical arrangement."
3,Quarter collaboration,"3 1/2For what it is worth- a noteworthy Glass album, Passages does have plenty of impressive moments amidst familiar tricks and thematic exploitations. Of course the Eastern influence tempers some of the material into something wholly unique, but Shankar is wrongly billed alongside the composer when he only factors heavily on a few tracks."

5,you can do it,"It's nice to come across a cooking book that has recipes not too fancy, not too complicated, and actually 90% of the recipes are easy and useable(to me), and most important, comes out DELICIOUS. Moreover, it's bilingual, has nice pictures, takes time to explain some basic steps, and uses two units! (very convenient)Highly recommended. Have fun to do some chinese cooking!"
2,"Great smell, great feel but adverse reaction","I am a licensed massage therapist in California and absolutely love using this stuff!! That be said however, I, like a few other therapists have found can no longer use this stuff because of hiving despite the new formulations. I have hyper sensitive skin as well a celiacs so I am super cautious of what I use on my clients and myself. I have just begun to develop hives along my hands and forearms while working on clients and it has only worsened with my occasional denial. I used the newly formulated cream for a year and just started to have a problem with it. Normally I would chalk this up to the insanity of my immune system however, I am not the only therapist that has developed a sensitivity to this cream.I would love to give biotone 5 stars for this great smelling cream, however, with my personal reaction and many others to the newly formulated cream I give it a two for the pretention of something that could be so great."
2,size matters,"1) Although I should have looked at the written size in the disruption better I thought I was getting the larger canister of cream, I did not, the canister being sold is NOT pictured, it is half the size.2) If you are going to USPO I wise companies would learn to use the US Post Office better, they have a something called a ""FLAT RATE BOX"" (free of charge and in two sizes) in to sizes costing to send anywhere in the US including Hawaii for about $9.00, not the $25.00 box i was charged. the items I got fit into the box even the item I thought I was getting fixes into the box.I will not be using this vender again.The product is very good i always use it on my clients"
2,Right product Wrong Size,I ordered what I thought was the large biotone and like the other guy got half of what I thought I was recieving. I could have gone to BioTone and gotten it for $10.00 more and gotten the large size.Shipping lately with Amazon has been bad at best.
5,Amazing stuff,"Works better than most massage lotions and cremes. It isn't messy, lasts for a long time between applications, and is overall a great product. I highly reccomend it."
5,Really helped!,"The nicest one on the market. Massages in well. Gives me pain relief. But for super relief, I mixed up my own batch of special cream. This product mixed with Original Blue-Emu super strength, Penetrex, Soothing Touch Muscle comfort cream, Pure Emu oil, and a little Voltaren gel! Wonderful! All bought on Amazon. Blessed pain relief for my knees! Don't need an operation yet!"
3,Massage cream,"This cream is just ok. It does the job, but it isn't as long lasting as I would like. It smells nice. Basically I bought it for the refillable tube that I can put a different cream in that I like better."
5,Love this cream!,"I found this cream from the advice of my esthetician. I love it. It is the best massage cream, my massage therapist uses it and it moisturizes well in these cold, dry winter months."
5,Love this,I ordered this massage creme not for massages but to use as a moisturizer.My mother also loves is as a moisturizer and she loves it to. It is also great for massages as well.
5,bought for sister in law,she's a massage therapist and swears by this stuff. we got it for her for christmas and this was the only place we could find it!
3,Excellent lotion but messy to dispense,"this is a good quality massage product with a pleasant aroma, but is very messy to transfer to a dispensing container. the lotion is too thick to dispense with a pump, so u need to ""spoon"" it out."
5,The Best massage creme!,I really love using this massage creme because it doesn't leave my clients feeling greasy and heavy.
3,Ok If You Don't Mind The Smell,"I bought it because it was highly recommended.It's ok as a massage lotion--I prefer one that is a bit more slick and not as easily absorbed--but the major problem I have is the residual smell, although it is supposed to be fragrance-free. It would be better to have a more distinct pleasant odor than the eventual off-musty/musky quality that the oil ingredients have.Clearly it will take a long time to go through, and I won't be purchasing it again. In the meantime, I'm adding some fragrance to counter it."
2,"Worked great, but it goes rancid within weeks","I liked it when I first got it, but I was using it for my family - not a business, so I didn't use it up in a short time. Within a couple months, it started smelling rancid, and I ended up having to throw most of it away. If you have a business and give several massages a day, this would probably be a great product for you."
3,Ok If You Don't Mind The Smell,"I originally rated it higher, but now that I've tried Biotone's Gel, I find that far superior.This creme is very thick--you have to rub it on your hands vigorously to ""warm it up"" and make the consistency easier to massage with.It has a fairly high degree of resistance vs glide, which makes it more conducive to very deep work.While technically odorless--as in they do not add a scent--it does have a distinctive odor, which I personally do not like."
5,Awesome Massage Creme,"My physical therapist used this on me, which is how I first became aware of it. It's not greasy, doesn't have any oily feel to it once on your body, and doesn't get absorbed very fast. I thought it was great when it was used on me, so I bought a big tub of it. Not gonna run out any time soon and I love it. It's the best thing for massages I've found for personal use at home. Would recommend."
5,I like this,I like this cream as it does not have a heavy frangrance. It spreads easily and it has a nice feeling while you are massaging with it. Just remember to put the lid back on or it gets very clumpy!!
3,Great massage cream,"This is a great massage cream. I don't like it as a moisturiser, which I realize is not the intended purpose. I was thinking that as a very nice massage cream I would also like it as a moisturiser. It does not do the job for that."
5,Like butter...the wife REALLY enjoyed it!,I ordered this massage creme after we got professional massages on our honeymoon. I think it may be the same kind that was used by our masseuse. It has a very smooth consistency coming out of the container and as it warms up it kind of becomes more like an oil. It has a nice fragrance...very subtle. It works VERY well for cutting down friction during a massage and really makes it enjoyable for the recipient. My wife doesn't like heavy massages but I was able to be a little more aggressive when using this product. She said she enjoyed the massage a lot better than the professional one (she's biased though...lol). I found the Biotone made it easier to massage her and I'm hoping she will use the stuff on me soon! :-)
5,Best Vanilla Ever.,"I first bought Ronald Reginald MELIPONE Vanilla while on vacation in New Orleans. Now that I've tried it, nothing else can take it's place! Ronald Reginald says it's named after the Mexican Melipone Bee that pollinates the Vanilla orchid- an exquisite background for exceptional taste."
3,Not pure vanilla.,"It doesn't taste quite right to me. Perhaps it's the unnamed additional ""flavouring"" listed on the ingredients list of the bottle. It wasn't clear from the advertising that this is only part vanilla and part artificial."
4,"Easy Read, Insightful","I have to disagree with some of the other reviews. I find this book very easy to read, not boring at all. I could not put it down.I'm no big fan of Jeffrey Archer, but this Second Book does go into more of the dark side of British Jails and Prisons. The drugs, the violence.... the way the inmates stick together, swapping Mar's bars for Phone Cards.. Very good."
4,Very interesting!,"I would have given this a 5 star review, but I don't think saying that I loved it, considering the topic, would havebeen correct.I certainly did find this a very interesting book. An insider'a look at a British prison was very interesting.One learns what the prisoners are fed, what the interactions among the prisoners were like and it wasinteresting to read that other inmates often turned to Sir Jeffrey when writing and how he was able tosurvive in such a setting.I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of volume three of his prison diaries."
3,"Interesting Read. Sadly, riddled with typos!","The book is well written, and if you are interested in anything Archer writes, its well worth buying.The only drawback is that there are so many typos in the book, more noticeable in the second half than the first half (strangely).I certainly hope this book is made available again, with the mistakes cleared up, and sent on to me without any cost to myself!Other than that, enjoy."
2,Dear Diary: Today I used the rowing machine,"Prison is boring, unpleasant. This book is boring, but not unpleasant. That is the lesson learned from reading this book. Archer spends so much of his time objecting to and fighting his conviction to really analyze prison life other than to make a few facile observations on the unintended consequences of some laws and prison practices.Archer has a few admiring reviews. From the Independent on Sunday: ""The finest thing that he's ever written."" From The Washington Post: ""A tale that is not only important but true."" These read more like sarcasm than praise. Just read them again, and scratch your head.Archer has written some readable fiction. I've read and enjoyed many of his novels and short stories. He can write well enough. Regardless of your perspective on whether or not he should be in jail, or deserved to be convicted, my conclusion is that Archer should stick to fiction."
5,Sublime mixture of poetry and music,"Abed Azrie chooses texts of ancient and modern Arabic poets as inspiration to his exquisite musical compositions. The quality of his voice ranges from a forboding darkness in ""Legend of the Bird: and ""Love Me"", to an etherial longing in his rendition of Al Hallaj's ""Murmur of the Breeze. The instrumentation and melodic lines are pure genius."
5,an upgrade to daily driving,these rotors are great quality and have been great. real nice look to them and way better than the vatozone parts.
2,Lines missing,"Lines are missing from the first book (the only book I looked at) and fairly often -- say every fifty lines -- two lines will be printed as one. The Kindle edition I'm talking about is quite readable, if you don't mind the missing lines, but at the price it's a ripoff. You can get THE EXCURSION along with every other Wordsworth poem except THE PREFACE from Penguin in two paperback volumes with excellent notes for about twice as much, and that's a far better buy.Kindle poetry continues to be disappointing."
5,Carmen made learning fun.,"Wow, I have this boxed set and it is wonderful. Back in the 90's it was a great way for me to learn lots of things just by watching this show. I love the whole ""Cat and Mouse"" thing with Carmen and the kids Zack and Ivy. The whole interaction between the three and the characters interaction with the player is great. though at times I must admit I felt like smacking the player in the back of the head. Anyway, this is a great DVD set and worth picking up. True, much of the political info will be out of date but it was true for the time it was produced. Still a great way to learn and have fun. I even had a Professor who thought Carmen was a great character. I wish some how the show could have continued a little longer and have a real grand ending. But in the end, it was a show that made people happy and it will make you happy too. So go ahead and buy it, Carmen fans, you'll be glad you did."
3,Inside is a Concealed Rip-Off of Chick Corea's 'Crystal Silence' !,"'The Beauty Within' is but a shamelessrip-off of Chick Corea's classic jazzcomposition 'Crystal Silence'. It maybe a bit more of a shifty dream, butCorea's melody is slowly stated insidethe core. Perhaps that's what O'Hearnis saying with his title. I've neverseen any credit to the real composer.I doubt it really matters now. It's astatue of limitations issue, perhaps.I don't think this CD will be pressedfor sale again, anyway. - WHATEVER !!"
5,Great ambient new age music,"This is definitely a 5-star release from Patrick O'Hearn. I first heard ""Indigo"" in 1991, when it was released, and immediately purchased the CD. I like every track and the CD still plays well. Sorry I don't have anything eloquent to say about it. I just wanted to echo the previous reviews, and say that I agree. Give this a chance, you won't regret it. ""The Ringmaster's Dream"" sounds like circus/carousel music, which is fun in a spooky kind of way. I wish these tracks were available here on Amazon.com MP3 digital music downloads."
2,Harness will not unplug,"I purchased this unit for my 1996 Ford Explorer. The rubber faces on the switches have dry rotted. Based on the posted comments, it was possible to disconnect the wiring harness and just install the two switches. I have been to everyone I know on how to unplug the wiring harness. I need the Amazon world to give me the hidden secret of how to get the wire harness unplugged from the switches, so I can install without having to pull the whole steering wheel.The plugs wiggle but will not release. I even went to a ford dealer and they stated that the unit is made in one whole piece and the harness will not unplug.Need some help here or this will become a worthless purchase"
5,Love it,"""Lucky Day"" is my absolute favorite song...all the music on this CD is great...lots of feel good tunes and a really unique, yet familiar vibe."
3,"Huh, where did it go?","I mean the clean unfettered story line, the pounding rythm. This book is very late to the shelves and seems forced. Unfortunately I found it choppy and dull which was a real disappointment as I had eagerly awaited its publication since the first novel in the series.I do not think that we will see another of these anytime soon. JV is a great author but compared to her earlier successes I think that this saga was a bit beyond her reach."
4,"Jack, Tawl and Now Raif","As a huge fan of J.V. Jones I hate to say that this book was a little disappointing. I have loved and read several times The Book Of Words series and A Cavern of Black Ice. Jones really gets you into her world and involved with her characters. However, the plot line of Raif and his quest was a bit anticlimactic. Also, the development of the bond that Ash and Raif have in ACOBI seemed like it was abrubtly dismissed. Other than that its a good book with the J.V. Jones style that I have loved over the years. I'm still a huge fan and I do recommend this book and her others."
5,Fabulous Series,This is a very gripping series. I've gone from one book to the next without being able to stop reading!
5,"Love the story, hate the grammar","So, I love the story so far. Book 1 and 2 were very difficult to put down, different than most books in their genre, and are written in a very easy-to-visualize manner, so I really get immersed in the characters and what they are going through. Which makes it even MORE frustrating when I come across one of the MANY MANY typos that get worse as this series goes on. Also, there are parts in the story where the writer seems to forget who they are writing about, and will put the wrong name, pronoun, or description. VERY irritating. Like they didn't get proofread at all."
4,Good stuff!,I like fantasy and I enjoyed this series so far. There is plenty of intrigue and magic to keep you reminded that this is not just another series and the author is not afraid to kill one of the good guys. I like the fact that she is able to track multiple cultures and settings so well.My only irritation is that I can't seem to locate anything to finish the series. I hate having to wait this long to see what else is going to happen.
2,Character Driven,"Quite a few of the characters in this story are really intresting. The problem is almost every character has their own storyline. They don't really interact much at all. This book is very uneven some chapters are spot on and others are just utter crap. I was very disapointed with the chapter where Raif fights the big bad. I was under the impression that there he would meet Ash like on the cover, nope the story's two main characters never meet in the entire book. Also without the cover illustration I would have no idea what the monster looks like theres is no real atempt to describe it except that it's so frightening no man should have to see it, wow thats lazy writing. Anyway theres more I could harp on but theres no point if you read the first book and liked the characters mybe pick this on up at the libray."
3,For Basic Knowledge,"The Smart Womans Guide to Plastic Surgery educates readers with basic knowledge of plastic surgery. I feel like some chapters are rushed and short. For example, the neck and face lift chapter is short and not as explanatory as breast surgery or liposuction. This book also has positive stories of women and plastic surgery. However, I wish that their was negative stories of women and plastic surgery. That way these readers can get a better idea if they want plastic surgery or not. I will say that chapter 1 is the best. Chapter 1 is the best, because it explains the scams plastic surgeons can fool people with. WHICH IS VERY SHOCKING!"
5,A must to read if you are planning for a plastic surgery,"This book is one of the best books that is easy to read and understand by a patient who is planning to do a plastic surgery. It explains in simple way what the surgery is, expected side effects, what could go wrong, and estimated cost. In addition, it gives you the methods currently available for your case and what are the pros and cons of each, in order to help you decide which method is most suitable for you. I strongly recommend you read this book if you are planning for any plastic surgery of any type in the future before you meet with your doctor. Yes, before you meet with your doctor."
3,Did not include any information on Upper Body Lift,"It answered a lot of questions so I am happy with the purchase. However, I found it incomplete as it did not include ANY information on upper body lifts. I was also looking for lazer treatment of wrinkled hands. The condition of the hands is usually a give away regardless of the beauty of the face (ed Priscilla Presley)."
4,Surgical intervention,"I read this avidly, but was shocked that she left out a MAJOR woman's plastic surgery: brachioplasty. Not even mentioned. For most women, a major source of concern: that flab under your upper arm. Other than that omission, a ""thumbs up"" review. Concise, thorough, informative. No need to rush into surgery uninformed: this is a good resource on how to do your homework."
2,Big disappointment from a fan of their older stuff,"I bought this album after being introduced to TD through Rubycon and the soundtrack to Risky Business. Compared to those, Melrose is a big disappointment. Not bad if you like 80's pop style ambient music, but nothing innovative or energetic. Rubycon is still the best that I've heard from them so far."
2,The beginning of the end...,"Sorry TD: this was the album that marked the beginning of the end for me. They were great on tour (yahey Linda Spa!), but the album was dreadful. The previous couple of albums, Optical Race and Lily on the Beach had shown a marked slide towards Radio-2-type blandness, but with some amazing stand-out tracks (SunGate (OR) and Long Island Sunset (LotB)). As for Melrose... well, it's not dreadful, but it was the end of a beautiful friendship: the bland leading into the blander. Sorry guys: best of luck."
4,"T.D.'s ""Melrose"" their most haunting","I listen to this c.d. about three times a week, and have since I purchased it 15 years ago. I think this one along with most of their work since 1985's ""Hyperborea"" is their greatest work. Talk about haunting!And the piece entitled 'Electric Lion' is one of their most energy-driven, with an awesome use of electric guitar near the end that ultimately gives it a hard rock sound. While ""Melrose"" is not their #1 best c.d. it is definately in the Top 5 in my book. I highly recommend this c.d.if you enjoy haunting electronica with a hard rock overtones."
3,"Is this a new take on Melrose, or simply a re-release on another label?","Okay, all of the comments linked here from Amazon's database are about the original Private Music release. This is, apparently, a re-release of the title on a different music label. Or, is it another Froese mashup of the original material? It has a different title, so I assume it is Jerome Froese's 2009 take on the original 1990 release. Why else give it a different disc title? If anyone landing on this page knows the answer and would be willing to post a reply, I'd appreciate it."
5,Filled with Energy,"Melrose (1990), is the creation of Edgar Froese, Paul Haslinger, and Jerome Froese. This team has put together a consistently energetic album -- it is one of my favorite Tangerine Dream (TD) albums from this era. Some may call it New Age, but it really does rock and I'd rather not use that New Age nomenclature to describe the sound of this work. From the opening energetic Melrose, to Rolling Down Cahuenga, to the mellow Art of Vision, the TD team has captured the essence of electronic/ambient creation in an instrumental outing with songs ranging from 5 to 10 minutes long. The album could easily be a soundtrack for a spacey movie, and makes for great background music. The sound is definitely a departure from the 70s TD and the 80s TD, but as they recreate themselves with the changing times, so too might their listening base evolve."
1,Adobe CS3 Nightmare: CS3 Will Not Install on All Machines,"All I can say is this program will require I reformat my hard drive in order to install it on my computer of choice. Adobe CS3 is very unreliable and finicky. I was able to install it on my old computer running XP but not my new one, which also runs XP. So, the failure to run does not reflect my ability to install it or my computer's operating system. There seems to be conflicts with other Adobe products. I would recommend purchasing the $9.00 trial version DVD from Adobe to see if it will work on your machine. If not, you have lost only $9.00. Adobe should have done a much better job to insure installability. If you're stuck with it, try googling ""Adobe CS3 install problems."" There are some convoluted workarounds suggested there. Since I had another computer, I opted to go that route."
1,Don't get express shipping,"The software is great and almost a neccessaty in todays design world. I still would beware of the Express shipping as they use UPS. I would give the sofware 4 stars and shippin 1 star but can't edit my rating, only the review."
4,Pride FC Critical Countdown Absolute 2006,"This is the second round of the Pride FC 2006 Grand Prix Tournament. The fights are excellent with some mindblowing techniques on display. If you love quality MMA, you can't pass this one up. The Tournament features MMA stars such as Wanderlie Silva, Mirko Cro-Cop and Vitor Belfort. This DVD is bound to make you say ""OUCH""! I highly recommend it."
3,SPRI Door attachment,Its ok for lighter bands. For heavier bands I would look to something else as the end is kind of small. Having a small end puts a lot of strain on the spot of contact. When I say heavier resistance bands I'm talking the 40-90lbs bands. Anything less and I feel it should be fine.
4,"Odd, unpredictable, interesting","While not Shirley's best work, Three Ring Psychus has the manic energy and unpredictable flow similar to late 70's/early 80's sci-fi mavericks like Mick Farren.Foreshadowing Shirley's interest in gestalt consciousness, cosmic adjustments, and social upheaval, Three Ring Psychus is a great science-fiction adventure and stands well next to his early work like Transmaniacon and City Come a Walkin."
2,Not 1990 Studio Cast Album,"Don't be fooled by 1990 Studio cast label. This is the soundtrack from the Movie ""Girl Crazy"" with Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney. In fact the tract listing as it comes up on the CD is completely different than the listed tracks in the accompanying booklet. Music is by Tommy Dorsey and the MGM orchestra. It seems to be compilation using mostly the soundtrack. The listing are in different order than the listing on the CD. In some cases the tracks totally different. In somecases out of order. In fact when I play this CD on my computer, the cover came up with the Judy Garland-Mickey Rooney version of the film,not the cover that is shown on the CD case. The sound quality is poor, as if it were transferred straight from the movie.If you are looking for a Modern Studio Cast album with modern technology,Beware this is not what it seems."
4,a solid silver set of screw jobs,"no one is as he or she seems,everybody is out to screw everybody else but in the end to their benefit.good fun. Also one of the few movies that i know of featuring a very young jay leno!!"
4,Delightful,"A delightful and easy read. Actually, three stories in one as the two main characters tell their own life tales in the context of the book. A story about overcoming hardships and tragedy through friendship, love and most importantly, hope. I felt especially drawn to the character of Mr. Serle, portrayed as a kind and warm ""father-figure"" type whose wisdom was both powerful and inspirational. The gastronomically descriptive text always made me hungry and wishing I was sitting at the tables enjoying the delicious foods with characters. I recommend this book."
3,Previous reviewers spoil the plot,"I enjoyed this book and would recommend it but why did the previous reviewers spoil it by telling the ""secret"" behind Mina's friend?Just some advice: please concentrate on whether or not you liked the book and not give away any plot details to readers who might not have read the book yet."
3,"Good intentions, weak plot","Mina paints an interesting portait of the hardships of the Irish and English people during the 19th century. We read about the potato famine in Ireland, religious discrimination, and the plight many people endured just to survive. It is based on this that I respect the book. Unfortunately, the author oversimplifies the plot and the characters, so every plot direction is completely predictable."
5,Loved this book,"Mina is a great story about a young girl who escapes from the potato famine and struggles to get to America. I especially liked this book because I've been trying to write something very similar, so it was fascinating to see how well the author handled the situation. She made us really care about Mina and want her to succeed, even though it seemed at the beginning that it would be impossible for her to ever reach her dream. I also liked the introduction of the cook (sorry, I can't remember his name) but his story of Jewish persecution added to the interest, showing the prejudices of the era, basically for anyone who was different from the white anglo-saxon protestants. Very well-written."
5,"Rich details, lovely characters","I just finished this book this afternoon and felt compelled to write a review here. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in narratives relating to the Irish famine -- the details of Mina's experiences in Ireland and on the boat were fully fleshed out and made picturing the events easily vivid.I think my favorite aspect of the book, though, is the character of Mr. Serle and Mina's relationship with him, which I thought was just perfectly as it should be. Love comes in all forms. The book ends with a clear note of hope, and I would love to read a sequel some day."
2,Nice historical details,"I loved the descriptions of the work in the kitchen, but I found the plot to be extremely flimsy. A happenstance meeting with an unscrupulous character later in the book was particularly egregious."
4,Raven the hero,"It is my view that folktales - tales of such quality that people kept the story alive for centuries - are excellent literature for people of any age. Anne Cameron aims her retellings of Northwest Native tales at a young audience but all of us can enjoy all of them. This particular volume is a favorite as I especially enjoy Nelle Olsen's illustrations.In this tale Raven recovers all the water of the world which she finds in a very selfish frog. Anne Cameron uses her considerable skills as a writer to plant the tale firmly in the Northwest wet, sea-based native culture."
3,Just ok,I had this cd years ago and thought it was better than it is. I only really like a couple songs. If I'd realized that I'd have bought the couple songs on itunes instead.
5,A most creative use of the CD format.,"Hidden tracks and tomfoolery highlight this effort from Central Virginia transplants, Cracker. Often featured artists at the Capital City Barn Dance, this band lends itself to utilizing all available means to produce lighthearted entertainment. From hardrocking tracks such as 'Let's go for a Ride' and 'Movie Star' to the melancholic anthem on the hidden track 'Eurotrash Girl,' (Suggestively hidden on track 69 of the CD)this Disc is sure to provide a wonderful soundtrack for any sort of frivolity. Frontman David Lowery displays the full range of emotions from happy-go-lucky to shit-out-of-luck. Guitarist Johnny Hickman's soulful eclectic style complements Lowery and his very emotional presentations."
4,Good stuff -- track info cracked...,"Other reviews have fairly marked this an an excellent album, however, be aware that if you want to listen to Eurotrash Girl skip ahead through endless dead tracks to #69. There's another cut on track #99... you get the picture. Can't wait to try to play this one in the car."
4,"From one ""Cracker"" to another: A pretty durn good album","It's a toss up as to whether ""Medicine Hat"" or Cracker's self-titled first album is their best. Both have some great moments (and a few not-so-great moments). Were they a bit more serious-minded, they might have become a true country band. Alas, their smart-alek side is never far below the surface, and comes to the fore here on ""Eurotrash Girl"" (which has to be the best hidden track of all time). Also top notch are ""Get Off This,"" ""Take Me Down to the Infirmary"" and ""Sick of Goodbyes."" Skip the dreadful Greatful Dead cover the closes things out (before ""Eurotrash""). Overall, a solid sophomore effort."
3,"Good - But no ""Golden Age""","A very good album that peeters out about halfway through and never manages any semblence of artistic or musical focus or cohesiveness. Some great songs nestled in there, but can you listen the whole thing over and over again? Personally, I prefer the far superior follow up, ""The Golden Age."""
3,"Great TV, Bad Technical Support","I second Michael Franz's comment about their customer support. I called the support line with a simple question about whether this TV supports multiple systems (NTSC/PAL) and they were simply referring to the same information that I could get from their website. When I asked to talk to a technical person, they said they don't have any technical people in their office. Their only reference is the product manual!I have seen this model at Best Buy and the picture is just spectacular. I will also probably wait for a few months before I buy this."
3,Waaaaay Old School...,"I've been in the business for over 14 years. I've been operating 2 personal training studios for the last several years. I'm now moving back to the club management side of the business again and was looking for a refresher on sales, prospecting etc. The book was well done, but very old school. Lots of cheeesy closing lines, scripts, etc. Lots of the techniques are outdated in the new era of club sales. Pretty ""used-carsalesman"" like. However, good stuff on forms, tracking, setting up personal planners etc. Don't get me wrong, this is a good book if you're a young buck just getting into club sales... just skip over the closing sections and you'll be ok. If you want a VERY current, highly informative book on working in a club... get ""Making Money in the Fitness Business"" by Thomas Plummer. That one is 5-stars!"
3,Striving for wholeness,"3 1/2It's nice to see songs like the title track seemingly strive to exceed the sum of its parts, but the majority of this partially interesting Jazz guitar disc suffers from typical call-and-response type songwriting which in effect whittles down most of the emotional pull to mere technicalities."
5,"Angelic Soprano, killer instrumentals","This album is my all time favorite for this style of music. Much to my surprise and quite to my delight, these guys performed live at the Christmas Revels in the SF Bay Area last year. They sang many tunes from this album. Their amazing live performance is every bit reflected in the album, well, except live is always better, of course. So you can't see the beads of sweat on the performers if you buy the album, but the music is still amazing !"
4,Very Good,"I enjoyed this well-made version of the novel. It was intelligently made and very moving, especially toward the end. It is a stirring testimony to loyalty and love. I am hoping the film will soon be available on DVD."
2,pietrp,A low rate because of the lack of the subtitles who helps to undestand foreign people not so accustomed with spoken english
3,Ok but....,This was an ok rendition of the novel but it seemed to leave you with alot unsaid or undone. Just incomplete. It has been so so many years ago since I did read the novel and it may have ended in just the same manner but the movie left a feeling of incompleteness for me.
5,Excellent Interpretation of a Classic,"Being very familiar with the story from 'rote' reading in English Literature classes did nothing to lessen the wonder of seeing the story played out by an excellent casting of actors that bought the characters to life with care and sensitivity to the period and the people.I would recommend this video to anyone reading the book as illumination of the time, the place and the people.I would recommend this video to anyone trying to understand the human condition in a time of stratification, the cost of choices made that effect human lives, and the quiet generosity of those punished by a society in which they have no voice."
4,Silas Marner DVD Review,"Silas Marner, with Ben Kingsley, is an excellent movie with fine acting and dialog, and realistic settings. In my opinion, the musical score by Carl Davis is rather soapaoperatic and not very satisfying."
4,Scrapbooking Life's Little Moments,"I loved this book. I love Rebecca's style and her words are pure inspiration to help me think differently about what and how I scrapbook. Great pictures, wonderful ideas. I highly recomend this book if you are interested in exploring depth to your scrapbooking stlye."
4,No Teasing - good sunglasses,"I had been looking for stylish, polarized, tortoiseshell sunglasses and can't stand the brown or amber lenses you usually get and finally found these! Just some comments: They may look bigger on you than you expect if you have a medium to small face, not the biggest frames out there though. The lenses (and the frames) are darker than the pic shows and this may sound stupid but although they don't distort colours, they are a little ""dim"". With my previous polarized sunglasses I didn't notice the difference as much (so maybe these are better?). This will be good in strong sunlight though. They are wraparound and close-fitting and they can occasionally fog up inside. Occasionally they seem to pinch or rub the sides of my head a little but most of the time I don't notice that at all. If you want stylish and polarized - and especially the rare combo of tortoiseshell + gray lenses, these are a great option for less than Raybans."
2,"Good subject, bad execution","This book is about sensory modalities, like a bat's sonar, which humans do not have. Ever since I read Nagel's What is it like to be a Bat as a wee lad, I have wondered that very thing. So you would think I would have loved this book. You might think so, but you woul be wrong.Though I am very interested in the subject this review covers (hence the 2-stars) I could not finish the book because of the chatty, faux-chummy style. I compleatly support the idea that science writing does not have to be dry and jargon-heavy but there is no need for a forced imitation of an informal discusion.I may skim though the rest, but every time I open the book I want to send the author Strunk and White."
4,Very nice,"This stereo is really good if you need to bring it with you a lot. I've had mine for about a year and it still works as good as it did when it came out of the box. The only problem I had was that the antenna broke after the second week of having it, but still get good reception on the radio. It sounds really good, the bass on it is really deep and doesn't distort the sound, even at high volume."
2,volume disappointing,"We bought this radio for the workplace. We work outdoors building decks. We liked the design because its easy to carry (very ergonomic). It seems pretty durable and it plays mp3's wich is a big plus....howeverthe sound is terrible! Its ok at low levels but distorts greatly on the high end. Also it doesn't get loud enough period. I would only recommend this to someone for the workplace maybe, who never intends on playing it loud."
3,Extraordinary Interiors: Decorating with Architectural Salvage & Antiques,"Lovely photos for interior decoration but not really architectural salvage as promised in the title. The best is the cover photo which has nothing to do with architectural salvage and was an entire room just purchased at auction as is. This is more of what you'd find in a glossy magazine - If you're looking for architectural salvage ideas there are a FEW, butyou won't find much here."
2,Not captivating,"I got the feel of ""just suck it up and make it work"" out of this book. That isn't what I was looking for. Do not waste your time on this book in less you are in need of a guilt trip.If you are looking for a fabulous book, check out Conscious Divorce (I think by Susan Allison). It was incredibly helpful. I went to 3 councelors, church, joined community groups, and read & listened to every book I could get my hands on. The Conscious Divorce really helped me work through my dissions & problem.sI wish you peace & happiness!"
1,Too much God Talk,This book went straight back after browsing through the various chapters! I could not get beyond the frequent references to the bible and all that goes with it. I hope I can find help without having to resort to books that rely solely on a Christian belief system!
5,Dont give up until you have done everything you can to make your marriage work so you can have peace about your descision.,"I found this book to be very challenging and it would help any woman wondering if their marriage is worth saving or even can be saved. I read the book to understand how women felt and what they faced with a disintegrating, loveless and what seems hopeless marriage,and the huge descision of whether to stay or give up is inevitable and must be made.The book offers hope when all seems lost and hopeless and beyond help. Many of the questions women have are addressed in the book and will help them get a clearer picture of what hope they have .The world says give up but with God there is hope and a future for a great marriage. I would recomend this book to any woman asking the question ""Can I love my husband again?"" or ""Did I marry the wrong man?""This book will also benifit women who have not come to that cross road yet but have questions and doubts about their marriage."
1,HORRIBLE!,"I should probably have read the entire book before writing a review, but honestly, I can't stomach it. I realized before buying that it was Christian-slanted, but I didn't realize just how much. (Nothing against it....just not for me.) The author's statistics on divorce are a little over the top, and trying to ""scare"" me into staying in an unhappy marriage in the first chapter of the book are not the way to win me over. This has got to be the WORST book I've ever bought. I don't think I've ever put a book down during the first chapter."
1,Not so much...,"I guess I didn't read far enough into the reviews to know that this is so Christian-based. I am sure others would appreciate that, but it turned me off immediately."
1,When Love Dies How to Save a Hopeless Marriage,"I read the book and it's a good book, but the book did not save my marriage. My husband wants a divorce."
4,Read this before you file for a divorce,"As an author of a divorce book, it might seem strange that I am recommending a book on how to save your marriage. But I firmly believe that a couple should do everything they can to try and save their marriage, if possible, barring any physical or mental abuse. Read this book before you file for divorce, if after reading it you still see divorce as your only option, at least you will know that you did everything in your power to save your marriage before getting a divorce.Christina RoweSeven Secrets to a Successful Divorce"
1,Not helpful at all,"I did not find this book to be helpful in the least bit to help save my marriage. The author urges you to accept the situation and just learn to be happy with what you have. I believe in God and religion, but this book went way too far with that angle. A little would have gone a long way with me, but not the main theme throughout the book. I am writing this review because I did not get this indication from the other reviews I read before buying it. If you did NOT include ""Love, honor and OBEY"" in your wedding vows, then this book probably isn't for you."
1,"Academy Award Winners, The First 50 Years","NEGATIVE Transaction.After paying and waiting for 4 weeks for the tape I had to contact the seller in order to find out when I would receive it.I was told I won't, that probably it got lost in the mail.I still can't believe that, do you?F-, very negative transaction."
2,GREAT OVEN--BUT SHORT LIVED,BEST CONVECTION OVEN I HAVE EVER OWNED. COOKS SUPER FAST--WITH JUICY CENTER AND CRISPY ON THE OUTSIDE. BUT VERY NOISY AND FALLS APART WITHIN 1 YEAR. TOO EXPENSIVE FOR SUCH A SHORT LIVED PRODUCT. I HAVE OWNED 5--AND ALL ARE NOW BROKEN.
3,Pro's and Con's,"The motor of my 3rd jet stream oven just died. I'd say that they last about 3 years.Pros: Great for heating up pizza and frozen items like egg rolls. Great for fish and meat. Very easy and fun to use.Cons: Not made to last. Too many parts (lid, rack, inside pan, pan holder) to clean after each use. I confess that I often did not wash it if it wasn't too messed up. Replacement lid very expensive. If you don't get the knack of attaching the lid, it will break very quickly. Unlike microwave ovens, the price of these gadgets do not seem to decrease over time.I will remember it fondly, but I am not getting another one."
4,Nesco Jet Stream Oven,"This is just like our previous cooker, it works great! Slight odor the first few times used, that ""new"" smell. We use it several times a week to cook small things, have never cooked a meal in it.Could not submit warranty, unable to read model number, or serial number. The numbers are engraved, but not raised enough to see."
5,Terrific! Highly recommend,This jet stream oven is great! I've worn mine completely out and need to buy a new one! I won't go with anything else. It took a little getting used to in the beginning on really believing it could cook so fast but once I relaxed it was great! Stuffed porkchops is one of my favorites in it. My kids like chicken parmesan. I have even baked cookies in a pinch but actually prefer the regular oven for cookies. Every thing else is great!
1,lasted 5 days,"Purchased on Feb.11th. Brought home and fired 10 times that day. Fired 3 times on Feb.13th. Now has a crack in it where the bow set screw tightens. Instructions say not to over-tighten that screw. As a lifelong mechanic, I think I have a pretty good grasp on torquing hardware. The problem is that the screw is oversized for the application. This invites the user to torque it more than the plastic can take and it will crack. But, I only tightened the screw until the bow stopped moving and no more. If you buy this, it WILL be in the trash within a couple of weeks."
2,easily broken,"the metal is poor quality and bends easily, the instructions on how to put it together are non-existent, and it is difficult to put together."
5,thank you,love to hear him sing. great cd. very happy and satisfied. not only is this man talented but also very hot.
5,Declan is the Prince of Pop,He's the one and only. He made lots of Mongolians die about him. He's stil very popular male artist in Mongolia. Awesome and beautiful voice sounded on his album. One and only extraordinary voice in the world...
2,Great example of overprodution.,"I have to give the production team credit here. The arrangements are all top notch and Declan is obviously a talented performer. But the computerized, autotuning on his voice makes me wonder just how much of a singer Declan actually is.We live in an era where, with enough money, just about anyone can sound amazing. There is a place for this, but I'm looking forward to when Declan matures and releases an album that allows us listeners to hear his true voice."
3,Not sure yet,"Well the shipping was fast and the product appeared to be brad new, but as of right now the switches have not worked. My old one worked fine but the buttons were worn. I am still checking for a possible fuse or electrical problem."
4,Xantrex 300,I bought this item refurbished. There are more powerful generators out there including other xantrex models. The price was unbeatable and the product is adequate.
1,NB2L Canon type Battery,Do not buy this battery. It did now work for me at all. It would not hold any charge.Ultralast UL-NB2L Canon NB-2L Equivalent Camcorder/Digital Camera BatteryI would not give it any stars. worthless
4,Good Battery - Just Keep it Charged,"Fully charged battery on external Canon charger, then tested in a Canon Rebel XT w/ Grip. At 600 snaps the battery was still registering 65% charge (meter tested). The battery holds up well against the Canon OEM battery, but only time will tell if it can hold up. I highly recommend that you keep it charged at least 30-50% when not using it and check it every couple of months to make sure it isn't about to die. This battery has a good chance of not working properly after sitting dead for a prolonged period of time (more than a week). Most of these cheap batteries are not top quality and will not suffer much abuse before giving up completely. Many are revitalized product made from the cheapest parts available. That does not however make it a bad product. If well taken care of, stored at room temperature, kept charged and not dropped - this battery should last at least 2 years, maybe three."
2,Can take max 20 pictures with my XTi,This battery does not last for more that 20 pictures with flash. Takes more time to charge than my original canon battery. I brought it to be a replacement for my canon battery. Does not solve the purpose.Spend some money and go for Canon Original Battery!!
1,This battery suddenly died in 3 months,"I did put a 5 stars review when I first time used it. But I have to take it back.The battery of course couldn't beat the original Canon battery, but at least it delivers reasonably initially.However, it suddenly died after 3 months under very normal usage. It simply can't take charge anymore. The total number of recharge cycle is less than 10 I believe.So it just worths a single star if not zero."
3,Not what was advertised,"I have purchased Ultralast brand batteries before (Standard disposables as well as camera batteries) and been very pleased with them, so I intentionally searched for this brand on amazon. The batteries I received were in a generic blue and yellow box and the batteries themselves were not branded as Ultralast. They were a fair price for generics and they arrived quickly, but were not what was advertised. I have not used them long enough to say if they work well or not."
4,"Good for the price, but flash recycling time is long","Well it cost about $8 and it has about the same level of charge that the original battery but the flash recycling time with this battery is about twice the time as with the canon original, if you don't have to use flash in every photo is totally recommendable, but if you need flash think twice because you are gonna need to be asking people to wait, but well it happens too with the original battery the difference is that with this happens from start and not when the battery is half charged"
4,Works Perfect,THis battery works just as good as the battery that came with my camera. This is a great backup battery.
1,Do not work,"Though the price is great, these batteries suffer from the same problem most non-canon batteries do. That is that they will go from showing a full charge to your camera not working in 2 minutes flat. You can then take them out, put another in, and two minutes later put the same one that said it was it back it and it will only work for another 60 seconds. Totally useless. Not even worth the two bits I paid for them."
4,What a Pleasure .....,What a pleasure - to discover some new classical music to me and to find out that this George Antheil fellow produced so many sounds that my brain finds so fascinating. Strikes the right 'chords' with me. This is my 3rd Antheil purchase. And what a dream ......Sam Ciurca
2,Definitely not what I expected.,"I've been listening to a lot of Ninja Tunes artists. So I've been getting the occasional exposure to Rap along with my big, lethal beats.in that context, I guess I have much more tolerance for it. See, I'm not really into rap. And seeing DJ Shadow and Latyrx (both of whom are extensively on Ninja Tune).So for the amazon customers who are looking for a rap album, I think youll find what youre looking for. The people who produced this album put a LOT of work into making it as good as it is.But for those looking for some butt kicking beats, there are probably only one or two Notably is Latryx 'Lady dont Tek No.' I reeeeally like that track. But I dont know that it was worth buying the whole 2-CD set.Note that the rating was based upon whether I liked it, not on the quality of the record. The quality is very good and you'll probably like it. It's just not for me."
4,True Hip-Hop,"This is a truly phenomenal album. Mainstream rap artists claiming to be hip-hop give people the wrong impression of what hip-hop really is, in my opinion. Hip-hop is about lyricism and turntablism, and constantly pushing the boundaries of both. This album does exactly that--the Gift of Gab, Blackalicious, and Latryx demonstrate amazing vocal skills with truly intelligent lyrics. DJ Shadow builds beats from the ground up, climbing towards the limits of intricacy. Hip-hop is about respect. If you can respect and appreciate true hip-hop talent, then this album will never disappoint you. Keep supporting the real hip-hop revolution."
5,Perfect for Indoor Bonsai's and other compact houseplants,"This is the perfect indoor and Bonsai gardening tool pack I have ever seen! It is so worth the price, and in fact extremely reasonable compared to most of your tools for indoor Bonsai plants. It is all in a very nicely made and durable took holder, with extra pockets for other tools you may want to put in it. It has a cool, glass spray bottle, for misting. The tools are very well made with wooden handles. All of the tools are very well made also and should last you a very long time. Anyone with houseplants, especially compact ones such as Bonsai's will find this money well spent, rather than some of those more expensive kits, with no holder, and only a tool or two in them. I highly recommend this for novice as well as professional houseplant enthusiasts. It would also make a perfect gift for your houseplant lover also."
3,liked it but too small,Good quality item but definitely made for house planting. Excellent gift for Mother's Day!
2,"Sophmoric Presentation, The elite in package design.","If you can get past the babe with the big red lips and her toungue, its not a bad book. The cover, presentation and chapter pages do little justice to the great design examples contained therein.How dare I, but I took a razor blade an 5 minutes and improved the book so I can now leave it out for my clients.I would like to have seen success/failure results. Did the package/product sell?"
3,Fun tapestries to color,Medieval Tapestries coloring book has cute renditions of medieval tapestries like the one on the cover of The Lady and the Unicorn. You can find the real woven tapestry reproductions at TapestryBiz.com in the Classic and Museum catagory.
4,so intense!,"copied on both sides of page ,so need to make a copy of the flip side. but real intricate designs"
4,A Nice Coloring Book For Adults.,"Adults who enjoy coloring will like this coloring book very much. It has some beautiful tapestries to color, and it gives historical information as well. I suppose that kids might enjoy it, but I doubt they'd truly appreciate the historical aspect of what they were coloring."
4,A girl's best friend...almost,"A versatile style for costumes or a regular night out. I always know that pleaser products are going to be comfortable and when they say size 7, it's a true 7. Easy to walk in too, so these are great for clubs and parties where you're on your feet for a long time. My only complaint is that they're pretty tight up at the top when fully zipped, even on average/lean legs. It's not painful, but is a bit annoying and you WILL have zipper marks on your legs when you take them off later. If you're a thicker lady, you may be better off with a lace up style or something else more adjustable around the calf."
2,"for very, very skinny legs only!","My 13 year old daughter ordered these boots to go with her Halloween costume. She was thrilled with the way the boots looked. However, when she tried them on, the full-length zipper wouldn't zip more than half way up - not because the zipper is defective, but because her leg is apparently too big around.My daughter is not heavy. She's 5-6"" and under 120 pounds, with average to slim legs. But the boots (size 8) do not even come CLOSE to zipping around her calves. Since she loves the style, she is trying to come up with a way to either stretch the material or cover/tape the unzipped portion of the boot, just for the Halloween party.Size 8 boots should have no problem zipping over an average-sized leg. Anyone who is even slightly overweight and wears a size 8, don't bother with these, they will not fit!!"
4,Love these boots!,So glad that I checked the other reviews before ordering because these boots definitely run small. I wear a 9 usually and ordered them in a 10 which fit perfectly. These will be great for my Halloween costume this year and in years to come - there's so much fun to be had with high heeled silver boots!
3,60's boots,I receive this boots in size 6 and I have to returned and buy the size 7 sizes runs small
2,no one dies in lily dale,Documentary that jumped all over the place. Not worth the money.No follow through on anything. Also kind of boring.
2,"OK, but not worth owning.","This documentary didn't really seem to be of the same quality as other HBO documentaries I've seen. It gave a decent history and description of Lily Dale, but that's about it. They interviewed many residents and followed a couple of visitors, but it was disappointing to say the least. Many ""stories/people"" they showcased seemed to be left unfinished or given very little info in their readings. It seems HBO was trying to be objective in the filming, but it just turned out to be kind of boring and uneventful."
1,Beware,We bought the Samsung 27-inch TV and it died less than two years later. It does not power-up any longer. It is frustrating and expensive to have to buy another TV after less than two years. Beware of this product and brand.
5,great tv!,"ive had this tv for a few days. i must say i am very impressed. it has sweet features without being overly complicated. i say hello to it whenever i come home. its name is fred or freddy. the ONLY complaint i have, thus far, is that when changing channels it does not display the time. u can push the display button to show the time, but id prefer the time show up every time i change the channel. the picture is crisp and there are a ton of useful options. i love fred! fred loves me! im going to go spend some quality time with fred right now. oh fred, im coming fred! be right there! buh bye."
3,Not the best.,"The watch that I received looks great and seems pretty solid. However, it gains time. It is currently gaining at a rate of about 5 minutes per week.Being my first automatic watch, I don't know if this is typical, but it is definitely not desired. I am going to look into adjusting it, but not sure how effective that will be.My rating is to indicate that I would neither recommend nor discourage a person from buying it. I think it has the potential to be a great watch, mine is just misadjusted."
4,Full of pagentry,"Empress is a true story of a woman who ruled in China. She had to be pretty special to achieve that title. Women were meant to follow behind the man and serve his sexual needs. When they weren't needed for that purpose, they sat around learning how to embroider. Empress is full of ancient Chinese politics of slaves and concubines, and people all trying to make their way to the top inside the Forbidden City. Each child born is given a name with special meaning to guide his or her life. The color and style of clothing is carefully chosen for each event. The jewels in the Empress' topknot send a message to her subjects. It also has its fair share of attempted poisonings, banishments and beheadings. I loved every minute of it but it's not for the faint of heart.Linda C. WrightAuthorOne Clown Short"
2,sadly half-baked,"I've been hoping for another (fictional or nonfictional) bio of Empress Wu since I first read Annette Motley's now out of print Green Dragon, White Tiger many years ago. Motley's book is a little long and perhaps romantically biased, and I was really interested to see what Shan Sa would do with the topic.Unfortunately, the text is so disorganized that I had difficulty following the story at all--this despite the fact that I know Empress Wu's life backward and forward. I'm afraid Shan Sa got overly caught up in her purple language and let her chronology and readability suffer as a result."
2,"Plodding, boring and dry","I love historical novels. I did not love this one. Nearly the entire novel is written from the viewpoint of the main character, Heavenlight, with no dialogue. So, with the exception of a very few pages, the entire book is an interior monologue. A generous interpretation would be that the author was trying to convey a sense of the Empress's inner life, but I don't think she was sucessful."
2,Didn't finish,"I tried, but found it hard to like Heavenlight and relate. It was well written and engaging, but I just couldn't really feel for the characters."
3,Wordy,"Was very excited to get this book but then disappointed. There was a good amount of history and charactersto keep me interested but it tended to get lost in elaborate discussions of processions,decorations, rites etcThese would go on for pages and sometimes I felt the people themselves were lost in the ""debris"" of all ofthe above."
4,Empress: A Novel,"The Empress is a poetic tale that gives one an in-depth look into the life of Empress Wu Ze Tian. One may be shocked by the ruthlness tactics used on the throne, but the author carefully constructs the novel so that one understands the culture of the time. I enjoyed that this was written in first-person because it is apparent that the Empress had a lonely position, and that she was viewed by the Chinese people as a god-like figure. This book can get tedious at times with detail, but the overall story is strong and a person interested in Chinese history will enjoy the vivid descriptions!"
2,A tragic waste of paper.,"Long and overly verbose for a psuedo-historical. Three whole pages (hardbound) of the most dry descriptions of a parade I've ever had the misfortune to read. Sadly, the character is simply too cold, uninviting and downright boring for even her most irrational acts to be considered interesting."
1,bored to tears,"Couldn't make it through this one. Usually I love historical novels but this one was ridiculously slow and the writing style painfully tedious. I was profoundly disappointed since the storyline sounded intriguing. For some I suppose the language will seem apropo for the subject matter, for me it only highlighted the labor of reading this novel."
3,"""Life's a Big Ole Tire Swing""","A perception of powerful life lessons and topics written with the ability to return us to those precious and/or insane places in our lifetime. Kay can take the steamer trunk of our past, the luggage of our future and open them only to find wit, honesty and uncanny insight. His incredible and unique style of writing describe my sometimes ""bumper car"" lifestyle and transform it into a peaceful walk in new fallen snow. Thanks to my friend Nancy for the gift of this book and Mr. Kay for his signing it. I can't wait to read it over again. The wisdom and talent of Terry Kay is evident in Special Kay."
3,"not really ""outdoor""--watch out for rust and deterioration","Hunter company assured us these fans would be ok on a covered porch in the Virgin Islands, about 80 feet from the seafront. The black iron motor casings corroded (rust and loss of finish) in just a few months. The replacement set corroded just as fast, and one motor froze up completely in less than a year. The blades on the remaining fan have delaminated along the edges, with white discoloration. Hunter should not be advertising these fans for use anywhere near seafront. Perhaps ok for inland porches with little breeze and little moisture in the breeze. Three stars for their good looks...wish they were durable."
3,Disappointed,"Expected ""the original "" hunter fan would look like the quality fan we had originally - the kind produced when there was not so much plastic and china didn't make everything. It works fine and will probably last but the plastic paddles look nothing like our original hunter - they look shiny and cheap - we should have saved the money and purchased a cheaper model! Very disappointing."
4,The Samples are awesome,"Even though this is an album of questionable quality audio wise, the performances are great. Sean works out on the gutiar extendo-style on several cuts. THIS IS A COVER ALBUM OF THEIR OWN SONGS. It definitley sounds like they recorded their rehearsals(the band was bringing in new members at the time)and said,""what the he!!, it doesn't sound half bad"" and decided to release it. I am an unabashed supporter of the Samples and although there are stronger efforts than this, any Samples is good Samples."
1,Poor Quality,the quality of this dvd was so poor we could only watch it once because it got scratched up just by playing it!
3,"Ok, but not great","I was hired as an extra on this movie in two separate places. I ended up on the cutting room floor! I wasn't hoping for a Hollywood career. Decent story. Nice sets. Filmed in Adelaide, Australia. Jack Dyer"
4,Very good Guide on the Theory AND the Practices,"Knowing the distinction between the three roles and functions (see title) is essential to be any good at either or all. Dah...And yet I wish more people would take the time and effort to get and read this book and know the differences.This book not only provides sound theory on all three subjects, but it also provides very good practical advice on how to practice either.If you want to be knowledgeable on these subjects, either for bettering your own performance as a manager or for knowing when and why to hire specific professionals, just read this book. Trust me."
3,Average Resource,"I thought the information was OK, but not phenominal. I was looking for WOW. Perhaps my expections were too high."
3,"Coaching, Counseling & Mentoring: How to Choose & Use the Right Tool to Boost Employee Performance",Generally a good tool for assisting employees who need some direction to improve performance.
4,more of a correction than a review,"I have not read this book. The purpose of writing this is to inform prospective buyers that there's a slight error in the book description. Checking with Kessinger's catalog, this book contains 94 pages and not the stated 226 (check book dimensions).I did rate this book, however, based on another book I have by the same author and publisher. It is Practical Psychomancy and Crystal Gazing (1907) and at 93 pages it basically has the same dimensions as this book does."
2,Moisture goes right thru,"It does not keep moisture off of wood tables, because it justs acts like an extension of the glass, ands sweats right thru. Have to put another coaster underneith."
4,Fun toy,My mom bought this for our son when he was just under a year old. At that time of course his feet could not reach the ground but he loved to sit on it and being pushed. As he started trying to walk he loved to push this around the house. Now at 19 months he still plays with it and can ride on it himself. Because it is so low to the ground and sturdy he climbs all over it and I have never worried about it tipping over. This has been a good toy that has provided interest as he grew and he continues to enjoy it. I highly recommend it.
2,"Mildly interesing, not very well written","This book would have been better served if there had been an editor to keep Mr. Vincent on track. He wanders about, stumbling on some gems of stories but mostly getting bogged down with unimportant, irrelevant, and uninteresting tales."
3,Quick little mystery read,"I enjoyed this one about a banker who become involved in a murder investigation. A client names him as her executor and after her murder, he gets interested in discovering who killed her. Not the best in this short series. I felt it left a lot unexplained, and didn't set the characters for the series very well. I liked Worse Than a Crime under the same name better, or her series written as Sara Woods."
5,Great book for families going through a teenage pregnancy,"One of the best books for families of a pregnant teenager I have read. I just wish it was around when I became pregnant at 16. Ironically, it was written the same year. I think it is a great example of a family focusing on what's important in the situation, instead of embarassment and what everyone else thinks etc.I would also love to know what happened to this family..."
4,excellent wrap up to an excellent story,"Wen Spencer dose an excellent job of blending science fiction, fantasy, love and romance in an alternative universe. The first book Tinker introduces the rich characters and sets the story in motion. Wolf who Rules, dose add additional characters but uses these new characters to deepen the readers understanding of Wolf and Tinker. Both Wolf and Tinker grow and change to meet the challeges created by their obligation to their families, friends, and their ""races"". I read each of these books in two days, literally couldn't put them down until the last page. I hope Wen Spencer continues this series, Tinker & Wolf deserve more adventures."
2,Kept Looking Like it Would Go Somewhere But Didn't,"I really disliked this book for a lot of reasons. The protagonist, who was a brilliant scientist in the prior book, turned into an elf at the end of the prior book, and essentially abandoned what once made her great. Maybe it's the sci fi fan in me, but I have little sympathy for a character who had the ability to give humanity the functional equivalent of an FTL drive and instead decided to play at being a member of the nobility in a feudal society. The author does such a good job of making the problems in the story seem insoluble that when they are solved I didn't quite believe it. Their is a mystery/foreshadowing throughout the book, but when the answers were revealed, they were disappointing."
3,"Great characters, great story, except...","Great characters, great story, except for the increasing cursing in this series. It is ruining it for me. Shame on you, Wen Spencer. If we hear it on television, we turn the tube off. If we hear it from colleagues, we walk away. It appears that we have to start closing your books. Such a waste! Otherwise, love your writing!"
4,wolf who Rules,I loved Tinker and Elfhome. This ties the 2 stories together. It feels like the author is connecting the main stories. I would recommend it.
4,Much Improved,"Much more polished than the first volume, and the plot is intriguing and at times, will keep the reader guessing. The characters are more defined and the main character, Tinker, shows definite growth and increasing maturity, although she is still too childish."
5,Wolf Who Rules,"I really love this book, perfect transaction. I'm addicted to this story!! I have to reaserch and see if Wen Spencer wrote anymore in this series!!! It can't be over!!!"
2,Not for seniors!,"I have arthritis, including in my back and neck. The moves she does would injure me if I tried them. Her pacing is way too fast; to really stretch you must hold the stretch and she just runs through it like a dance. The routine really is for a dancer, not a senior who has been sedentary which is how they advertise it. If you're like me, try another video,like Keeping Fit in Your 50s."
1,"STRETCHING FOR SENIORS, WHO ARE ALSO DANCERS","I'm over 50, after reading an article in an airline magazine about Anne Smith, I thought I could benefit from stretching, I was expecting a progressive program to stretching. I assume that most seniors do not have much flexibility, so it would be very nice to have program that would introduce stretching in a very slow and progressive way. I was disappointed to find out that it is not the case, this DVD is not stretching for seniors but stretching for senior dancers or seniors that have been practicing some method to maintain flexibility. For the rest of us it can be even dangerous."
1,Not for most seniors,This 30 minute DVD is really only a 10 minute program. It is well suited for 17-year-old Olympic ice skaters and experienced ballet dancers.
3,I bought this as a gift...,so I personally have not used the DVD. But the person I bought it for said the exercises seems useful and beneficial. She just wished the instructor had a slower pace to help her keep up. I would say this is a great DVD for individuals that are in moderately good shape and are not struggling physically.
2,Stretching for Seniors,"Very, very poor quality picture. Not relaxing to follow. Not what I expected or hoped for."
1,BUY SOMETHING ELSE,I DO NOT LIKE THIS TAPE AT ALL. THERE IS ABOUT 15 MINUTES OF REAL STRETCHING AND THEN SHE TALKS AND EXPLAINS THE REST OF THE TIME. I WILL NEVER USE THIS TAPE.
1,can't even give it one star,I bought this for my parents last week! We reviewed it together and just laughed at how ridiculous the routine was! You couldn't even hear what she was saying during the routine! The quality of the video was poorly done and so was the instruction! it is definitely not for people in their 60's!!!!
1,Very disappointed,"I don't think this video is for 69 year old, sedentary women like me. I am much too stiff to do any of the moves that she does. Getting on the floor is hard and my hand comes nowhere near my foot or ankle. About my knee is my limit. Ann gives us no advice on adapting the stretches in cases like mine. Also i don't have room for waving my arms about as she does. Overall I feel that I have completely wasted my money."
4,great,"This is a good beginning to stretching, especially for those seniors who are out of shape, but want to remain flexible."
4,ann smith stretching for seniors,"This is a gentle stretch to music that works every muscle set from tip to toe. The moves are choreographed to flow with the music at a very gentle stretch or at a more intensive stretch as one advances. It takes just 10 minutes for the full stretch. The 2nd phase is instructional so that the purpose of the movements is clearly understood. Very calming as well as improving muscle tone, flexibility. and balance."
2,Stretching for Seniors,"I was disappointed in this video. Although she is in very good shape for an older person I didn't feel any energy from her. I wanted more stretches, not ballet."
3,Senior Stretching,"I was a bit disappointed in this tape as I found it difficult to follow the movements without clearer direction. I was looking for a video that contained more of the exercise type stretches done in ""Senior Stretching"" gym classes."
1,"Unwanted ""Upgrade"" a ""Degrade"" w/Payroll Tax Errors!","I was a very satisfied Quickbooks Pro 2001 user. Program did everything I wanted and needed with no problems or issues. Was forced to buy Quickbooks Pro 2004 in order to continue to be able to do payroll. Not happy with Intuit about that move. You would think that with the Cdilla fiasco last year in Turbotax, Intuit would be changing its tune. Greedy company totally destroying the goodwill it had built up over many years.Quickbooks Pro 2004 is a bloated program that runs more slowly than 2001. Maybe it has more features than 2001, but nothing I would use. When I tried to cut a payroll check, 2004 screwed up my payroll taxes by not including my Medicare taxes! Glad I caught that one and manually overrode before I ended up with payroll penalties! This was after I ensured I had the latest updates. 2001 never had any of these problems.I am just about fed up with Intuit and will be looking for an alternative to Quickbooks next time."
1,Useless,"QB 2004 is useless for a non-accountant. It seems to be designed to sell add-on services, not perform a function. The idea that any reasonably experienced business person can not, without professional assistance, use this program is a indicative of just what a joke it is. A complete cottage industry has grown up around providing help with QB. That should have been my 1st warning not to buy this program. The fees charged by QB should have been the 2nd warning that this is not a program for the general user.I'll go back to pen and paper beforre I pay QB for support of a program for which I have already paid them. (...)"
1,"Pay now, pay later, always pay","Be aware that the product you buy today will be 'sunsetted' in a few years, if it lasts that long. And they only offer a token discount to upgrade. There is no value in being a repeat customer because they show no consideration for your loyalty. I don't view their decision to discontinue support for a product as an effort to provide better customer service, but rather an excellent way for them to substantially increase revenue without regard for the consumer. The idea of them requiring you to pay for a newer version of the software so they won't be overburdened servicing their own product blows my mind."
3,Still has Advertising,"I have been using Quickbooks Pro 99 and recently upgraded to 2004. I loved 99 but felt I should upgrade before it got too obsolete. I am sorry I did. The new ""Company Navigator"" has been hard for me to get used to but, the thing I don't like the most is the ""Company Solutions"" box. All it is is advertisements for monthly services Intuit offers and you can't get it off your screen!!!!! I paid full price for this program and I still get advertisements!"
4,Ways around e-mailing invoices and payroll gripes,"If you want to e-mail invoices, save them as a PDF on your hard drive (the option to ""save as PDF"" is in the File drop down) and e-mail them as an attachment through your server. To avoid the mandatory payroll subscription services, register for the ""do-it-yourself"" payroll at Intuit.com, don't enter a credit card, and don't install any of their tax calculation or payroll related software. If that doesn't work for you, switch to another product--QuickBooks isn't the only game in town! Other than the above problems, QB Pro 2004 works like a charm for me."
2,I agree with Bill above.....,"This program is great...at first, then you get lured into it and the bugs keep getting more and more annoying until you are forced to upgrade. We started using the payroll service a few years ago and now to change would be a big nightmare, so we pay every year for upgrades and tech support for all the little ""bugs"" they put in the program. It seems that at about a year the ""bugs"" get really annoying and the program itself keeps prompting you to upgrade, asking if you need improved performance and such, which you do because I think they program it to get more sluggish so you upgrade and you are stuck. If you don't want to pay forever and ever, stay away from Quickboooks."
1,New and improved - NOT,As an accountant I have experience with almost every version of QuickBooks. Real improvement to QuickBooks since the 1999 version has been scant. So-called improvements since 1999 amount to little more than odious marketing hooks positioned to sell other financial products.
3,I really ought to learn how to use it properly,"Quick Books is the sort of program that can do a lot of things...many thing you may or may not need. So the temptation is to just use what you need. If you run a business you may not have time to learn everything about QB. So you wind up like me, using the parts you need and the rest of it is a mystery. Still there are things in QB that boggle my mind, like why it will not allow you to print a bill. Why not? Oh, and once you are sucked into the QB collective, Intuit will barrage you with come ons to upgrade or buy ancillary products, and every 2-3 years they will render your QB useless and force you to buy an upgrade. You just have to suck it up and deal with it. QB certainly allows me to run my business but it's not even close to being perfect."
2,Quickbooks technical support problems,"I have been running Quickbooks 2004 for a while now. About a year ago I developed an error while using the ""Ask a question"" function. I contacted tech support, and they stated that I had to pay a fee to find out why their product didn't work correctly any longer. I checked, double checked and tripple checked that auto update was on, and manually made sure that my software was 100% updated, which the updater said it was. I recently did an internet search on my error and discovered that Intuit has a quickbooks / Internet Explorer ""security patch"" for this product. I downloaded this patch, which auto updater apparently is unaware of, and now the ""ask a question"" function works again. It is quite disconcerting that Intuit would charge me a fee to tell me ""Yes we have a patch to fix that problem"""
2,service is a total scam,"I ordered Quickbooks 2003 pro edition based on accountant's suggestion. I then of course called in to Quickbooks as I ran into a probelm and decided on the $300+ annual support, which before any ""support"" was provided, seemed like a good idea. Turns out that the ""support"" kept me online for over 2 hours trying to solve a problem and at the end of 2 hours said he couldn't fix it. The only other time I called in to Quickbooks ""support"" was to cancel my ""support"" and was sent a letter saying that they can't cancel it and will continue billing me $29.00 a month.I now pay someone who specializes in Quickbooks to walk me through any problems I come across."
1,Forced to Upgrade to this Inferior Product,"Intuit forced me to upgrade from a very stable QB2001 product in order to continue to process payroll. Now, our custom utility to import shopping cart orders via IIF files no longer work. We follow the help file to no avail. We download Intuit's own examples and even Intuit's examples fail in 2004. Basically, Intuit's greed to get my $150 for an upgrade is now costing me hundreds per day as we have to manually re-key orders."
4,Huge improvements in invoice/statement output,"I rated Quickbooks Pro 2003 as very poor (one star) but this one really surged forward for our business. The huge feature to me was the addition of the ability to duplicate fields on invoice/statement templates so we can use tear-off strips that have all invoice information. Our invoices/statements now look very high-end and customers like them better. I find lots to like about this new software and find it was worth the upgrade money for this alone.Hopefully without sounding protectionist, one feature I very much dislike is the Indian-based customer service. Not only were they difficult to converse with, but they had a very 'don't care' attitude (3 calls over past 6 months.) I am always pleased when I call and get US based representatives."
1,Greedy Intuit will milk you for every penny!,"If you use the Payroll Tax service, BEWARE: Just a few years ago it was $50 annually to subscribe to the payroll tax service. In 1999 it went up to $79. Then in 2001 it doubled to $149. In 2003 it went to $169 and in 2004 they have just announced they are raising it to $199 annually. Each time they remind you that ""it's still a great value!"" (Peachtree plays this same game). On top of that, they retire (""sunset"") old versions every 2 to 3 years. So expect to buy Quickbooks 4-5 times over the next 10 years. They will continue to play this game until customers drop off in droves and/or someone steps up with a better offer.Update 2007: Payroll Tax Service is now at $350!"
2,It all depends on where you're coming from.,"If you don't mind being manipulated and having Intuit suck money out of your business on a long term basis, Quickbooks is worth considering. Also, Quickbooks is a standard double entry accounting system. If you have a small business and you know little or nothing about accounting, you're probably better off hiring an external bookkeeping, payroll, and/or accounting service. It might even be less expensive, and certainly less time consuming, in the long run."
2,Don't break the carafe!!,"I'm sorry, but the complaints about the small hole to fill is very nit-picky. If you take your time and fill the reservoir slowly, it's totally not an issue. The coffee maker works great on all other levels, but the real problem I have is we broke the carafe not long after we got it (naturally). Ok, it happens, but can you find a replacement anywhere?? We had a Mr. Coffee before and you can easily replace a broken carafe for a fraction of the cost of the coffee maker. I can't even find a replacement on Farberware's site. That brings down the rating as it's inevitbale that someday an accident will happen and the incompatible coffee maker becomes useless."
1,Farberware Coffee maker Model #FCM12SS,"I hate it !The water pour-over hole is too small. (I had to modify a funnel to make it easier)You have to make sure the filter basket ""snaps in"" to engauge the autu-interrupt feature. Otherwise it will overflow the filter basket.Requires a special cone-shaped filter #4.It's not fast.The steam that accumulates on the lid makes it drip behind the maker when you open the lid to empty the grounds.The company engineers should be fired. Or at least truly test their designs before they put the company logo on the machine.And finally, For now, It's a little too tall."
1,Not So excellent coffee maker,I did not purchase mine through amazon just a large Brick and Mortar store. Like many that have reviewed this coffee maker I too find the opening for where you pour the water very small. Also the warming plate does just that it keeps the coffee Luke/tepid warm not semi hot. My largest gripe though is the fact that after only five brews the coffee maker FAILED the LCD went wacky I.E Crazy strange numbers and then fizzled out. Lucky the little bit of water left finished brewing. After only five brews a pot should not. I would not recommend this product to anyone move on consider Krups or another brand.
2,I'm Joinin' the 'The Reservoir is too Small' Club!,"Yeah. It's *way* too small. Yeah, I wind up dumping water all over the counter every time. And that is only the beginning.If you happen to overfill it, there is a nifty little hole in the back of the coffee maker that water gushes out of. Have the towels ready, folks, if you're gonna use this baby. Heck, sponges even.I'd trade the fancy-schmancy little timer thing for a bigger reservoir any old day...But that's not all!!...Sometimes, for no apparent reason, as the coffee is brewing, it leaks out of the thing (I still haven't figured out where, or how). Once the coffee is finished, you have a nice 2/3 full pot of java.It's such a piece of junk I want my old coffee maker back that I bought at a garage sale for three bucks.Looking to buy a coffee maker? Look elsewhere."
2,Big and clumsy,"This coffeemaker is tall, too tall for my taste. The lid won't open all the way if you put it under a cabinet on a countertop. The area where you pour the water in is small and awkward (especially for lefties, which I am). There is no backlight or luminescence on the digital clock, so when I walk through the kitchen at night I can't look over and see what time it is."
2,FARBERWARE 12 CUP DRIP COFFEE MAKER,"I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED TO RECIEVE THE DRIP COFFEE MAKER. I MUST HAVE ORDERED THAT IN ERROR. I REALLY COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO RETURN IT SO I DID USE IT A FEW TIMES. I HAVE VERY HARD WATER AND DRIP COFFEE MAKERS LAST A VERY SHORT TIME. THE COFFEE LOOKS LIKE THERE IS OIL FLOATING ONTOP OF IT. NOT VERY APPETIZING. THE STAINLESS STEEL SIDES ARE DIFFICULT TO KEEP SHINY. I HAVE SINCE PURCHASED THE FARBERWARE 12 CUP PERCULATOR WHICH WORKS VERY WELL FOR ME. I WAS REPLACING ONE THAT ""DIED"". I APPRECIATE ASKING MY OPINION."
1,LEAKS ALL OVER,"I am in the market AGAIN for a new coffee maker, this is my 4th in the last 2 years, this one did great for the first 3 months, now it leaks all over the counter for no apparent reason.The space for adding water is TINY ! ! !I make sure and put exactly 12 cups of water in machine, 3 end up all over my counters at 6 am and the rest is in the pot of not overly hot coffee.Would NOT recommend this maker to anyone, EVER."
3,Cheap is as Cheap Does,"Looks great.. if only they put as much effort into the quality as the facade. The machine function itself works fine: programmable timer, brewing, etc... But there are so many frustrating short-comings it's almost not worth buying despite the $19.99 pricetag.Yes, the area for filling the reservoir is ridiculously small. You can fill it without spilling if you pour slowly, but this is a poor design that I'm surprised made it off the drawing table. You'd think Farberware was the first company to make a coffee machine.I've owned mine for about a year and the warming plate has begun to corrode! As in RUST. The company didn't even make the warming plate out of rustproof metals; it's just cheap iron, and poorly coated to boot. When I contacted the company they said it was out of warranty, despite the fact that my problem is a production defect, not a warranty issue. If you buy this machine, just remember, you get what you pay for. 'Nuff said."
4,"Solid, reliable and functional","I bought this unit for my office over three years ago and it has been producing 3 to 5 pots of coffee everyday since then with no problems.It works relatively quickly, the controls are straight forward and the coffee temperature is good.The only drawback is the small water receptical."
1,Pass on this one...,"The opening to the water resevoir is beyond small. A fair amount of water always leaks out when trying to fill it. Mine also had a funny smell to it for a week or two. Also, the pot leaks when you poor coffee into a mug."
2,"Puzzling, to say the least....","Like everyone else, I found the absurdly tiny opening for the water is a royal pain, & certainly drags the rating for this way down. After setting it up, impressed with the features, & price, I couldn't even see where the water should go, and looked to the instructions, which weren't much help. I finally realized, that despite a huge lid, which is only for the filter, the opening for filling was a tiny, narrow slit towards the rear of the unit. This is way too small, and not only must you be a great aim, but it's quite awkward maneuvering the carafe to enable it to fully empty!I truly cannot believe that someone, or ones, were paid to ""design"" this model! What were they thinking???Oh, well, this is the third coffeemaker I've bought recently, the first two were even even worse, so I'm still undecided if I'll return this, or just live with having to be ultra-precise when filling it....."
1,Should come with lots of sponges,I just got this coffee maker and am sending it right back!!! The opening to pour water into is tiny so the water ends up all over the counter. When pouring your coffee it also ends up all over the counter. A little side note... I also didn't like that the clock did not light up.
1,Buy at own risk - NO replacement carafe available.,"3 months after purchase, the carafe broke. Makes good coffee, but you CANNOT GET A REPLACEMENT anywhere, so buyer beware."
3,"Good Song Selection, Diminished Voice","The song selection is great. The singer is, of course, great; but this is not one of Etta James' finest performances. I have hundreds of her recordings. But I must say that, at this point in her life, it is clear that her voice quality had diminished. Her voice lacks the fullness, richness, and emotion prevalent in most of her recordings. Nonetheless, this recording of American standards will add a bit of variety to your existing Etta James collection."
3,Only for trucks with lift kits.,"Checked and it said it would fit my truck. Did not show it would only fit if I had a suspension lift kit installed. Called Rancho customer service - no help. Also not very courteous. Had to re-fabricate the bracket (cut, grind, fit, grind) to make it fit. A bit of trouble but I made it work. They should make that clearer."
2,LMP tumors ARE cancer,"my comments are directed primarily to the physician above who stated ""many of these patients do not have 'cancer'"". as a woman with recurrent LMP, i must protest this statement. my gynecologic oncologist views and treats my disease as cancer -- my symptoms and disease progress are absolutely malignant and are treated as such. one of the problems in treating LMP is that it is slow growing, so current chemotherapy regimes may not be effective (chemo targets fast-growing cells). those of us diagnosed with LMP and/or micro-papillary disease are often at a loss on what to do when the cancer recurs and metastasizes. agreed, this particular resource is no more helpful than the free PDQ documents available on the 'net. but PLEASE, recognize that LMP is cancer, and women are dying from it every day!"
2,spend the extra dough,save your money and by a book that doesn't just show you a couple of rollover and slideshow tricks. Seems to be thrown together in a hurry. Start on Chapter 3 or you'll fall asleep
1,I agree with the reader from Japan,"I followed the examples, wrote the same codes but nothing worked. This book has many good examples related to graphic design but seems to be lacking details. I haven't read the second edition and I hope it's better than this edition."
1,Buy a different book,"I came to amazon.com tonight looking for a better book than JavaScript For The World Wide Web. The book's information is illogically presented, and the examples do not work. I can program, and even I find the book confusing. I pity any beginner. Thank goodness I got it from the library!"
5,Great Book!,This book is great for people with a background in other programming languages. It lets you dive right in with clear concise definitions and examples.It is not for people who want in depth explanations. The book cuts out most of this fluff.I wish he had an advanced book out. Some more in depth explanations would be nice on some coding techniques particular to JavaScript.
1,Jeremy Schneider went on to notoriety!,"This book is no indication of his future, but the contributor Jeremy Schneider apparently went on to get involved with some shady internet operations. See howtoburn.com"
5,The Lions of Tsavo:,"The Lions of Tsavo by James L. Haley is a great novelization of ""The Man-Eaters of Tsavo"" by Lieutenant-Col. John H. Patterson. Lions in the night attacking the workforce of the mighty British Empire that is trying to construct a bridge over the Tsavo River in order to advance the Uganda Railway. It is a great adventure book for many different people. I loved it. I can say it is a true page turner. I think others should read it on the fact of the Tsavo man-eaters being written about nearly 100 years after their attacks. Think about it, lions roaring, men screaming, hammers pounding, the 'Empire' moving forward with every breath. And yet construction stops for three weeks and Patterson wins the fight. All I could say after reading it was GREAT! Wonder what you will say?"
4,A pretty good learning tool,"This book is not for the very novice sailor. Actually no book alone is but a good teacher and book is what is needed for newbies. The details and topics discussed were great, though the section on knots left some to be desired. Why can no sailing book acurately cover knots? I would give it a B+."
1,Disappointing,"After having read previous feedback of this and other sailing books, I decided to go for this. I am totally new to sailing, and hoped for a good and thorough introduction to it. I find the structure of the book to be somewhat messy. I can only assume that this book is rather meant to be for someone which has spent some time on a sailing boat before. And I think this book is mostly for American readers."
3,For beginners,This book covers a wide area in sailing. Some things aren't relevent to the learning to sail. The author tried to fill the pages with words. I was unable to pick up much valuable knowledge from the book. This book is only suitable for beginners or people who want to know a little about sailing.
3,Why offer a product that is unavailable,"I ordered this book from Amazon in August of 2006. It's now January of 2007 and I still don't have it. Every month, Amazon has asked me to be patient and has given me a new anticipated ship date. I can't understand why they offer a product that is not stocked and not available."
1,Not for beginners,"Since an experienced sailor has no need for a book like this, then it should be pitched to beginners. Unfortunately, the book is written for the author's sailing buddies, not for a novice who does not have a good command of all of the sailing jargon. It's not so hard to translate some of these terms as you go, but it seems that the author is unwilling to accommodate to people who haven't really mastered the terminology, and it becomes so dense that it's pretty useless for a beginner, and all I got was a headache."
2,The Complete Sailor,"Not too great; however, I learned a few things from it, but quite outdated.Guess I will have to keep looking.."
3,Sailing for the VERY first time,"For the skilled sailer the book will be a dissapointment.That said, the book will be an important source of all kinds of maritim knowledge for the beginner."
4,Second Copy,"This book gives a great introduction to sailing for the first time sailor or wannabe.It gives an overall picture of sailing the principles practices and the nuts and bolts or sails and knots. Great book for layperson, interested in sailing and the art there of."
5,Best sailing book!,"This is a great book to learn sailing, it has great graphics, very well explained and if you want to get good advice you might as well get this book. I have already read it twice and use it as reference whenever I need to. great book."
1,"2,000+ Pages In Search of an Editor","This book contains an appalling numbers of errors, inconsistencies, contradictions, typos, and other editorial oversights. The errors run the gamut: medication dosage errors, math errors, photos and graphics that do not math the description, spelling errors, misinterpretation of statistics, and more. This book may not kill any patients, but it will likely result in many students having to re-take their paramedic certification exams. You will do well to select another text whose authors and editor took the time to check their work."
4,Great book,"Most text books, once I am done with them, I sell. This book I will be keeping. Great text book for reference."
4,Paramedic Care,"I'm taking a Level 3 class (Critical Care Tech) and the instructor had us buy a book package to start with, then another set of books for cardiology, then gave us handout homework assignments from another book yet! And that book happened to be Paramedic Care. Well, having another published book/workbook, it was next to impossible to quickly find the answers so, I searched about one days time to find this book, the one our handouts are from, and now I'm sailing threw the class!"
5,Tangerine Dream live and at the height of their career,"Johannes Schmoelling, who was a member of TD when this live album was recorded, has said that this was his favourite lp with Tangerine Dream. The music has real verve and energy and represents electonic music at its best. Along with Tyger, Rubycon, Poland, and Hyperborea this is one of their greatest albums."
3,Dark Stone,"I purchased this ring for my mother for her birthday, and I also purchased one in peridot for myself. The stone was so dark that mom thought it was a dark blue sapphire,sadly, I had to tell her it was actually an amethyst. The setting is beautiful and I really enjoy my peridot version, and my mom really likes her dark purple amethyst version. I would recommend this purchase."
4,Santa Brought A Son,"From the Desk of Emily WintersBachelor #4: Reed ConnorsTitle: VP of Global MarketingThis month's scheme: surprise him with this long lost love--and secret childI've always thought there was something missing in Reed Connor's life. And now that our research has turned up his high school sweatheart Samantha Wilson, I think I know exactly what it is. Luckily, Christmas is just around the corner, and so is the perfect excuse to sent the ambitious executive back to his hometown. Now all we need is a nudge from Santa, and one little boy---who's been very good this year--just might get the gift he's always wanted..."
3,Misleading.,"This is not the correct track listing for the disc that was sent to me. Not even close. I bought this CD because i thought these were rare tracks that I've never heard before, but the CD i received was filled with songs that are readily prevalent on other ""early years"" Bee Gees CDs. Fun songs... but i already have them and wouldn't have purchased this CD knowningly."
5,great traditional flip-flops,"Feels good, walks great, and has the best player in the worlds number in them!"
3,Home Video - Citizen,"Half electronics and half-rock, Home Video's CITIZEN EP might seem like an odd hybrid, but it certainly makes sense, given Warp Records' widening musical view. The tracks trade off: ""Citizen"" is more rock than electronics, while ""We"" is the direct opposite. The vocals have that crooning emo quality, even if they don't entirely rise above a lack of affectation. ""In a Submarine"" has a certain DFA quality to it; it's almost dancey! And ""The Tundra"" has a Peter Hook-like bass to punctuate the dark beats -- the track almost sounds like a darker version of New Order. A promising introduction."
5,SOOO comfortable!,Where do we spend a lot of our time? Why not be sooo cushy comfortable! This product is awesome...and a pretty light baby blue color.Would like to see it in bone as well. I would have bought that color preferably but could not locate it in elongated cushy! AND MADE IN USA!!!!
3,some good ideas,"This was an ok book. deffinently aimed at the toddler/preschool age group.I felt the chapters were redundent. I got some good ideas from the introduction section and skimed the chapters of interest to me. But felt once I read the introduction, and learned the method, it was just a matter of using those words in the specific situation.I did get some good ideas for communicating with my special needs pre-teen, who has a hard time getting his thoughts out of his head.Rent this from your library before you buy!"
2,It's as if the authors are scolding the reader over and over,"It's almost unbelievable. The title of this book is ""Getting your child from no to yes without nagging, bribing or threatening"" yet that's exactly what the authors do to the reader throughout the whole book. The book is almost entirely made up of paragraphs of don't do this followed by a paragraph of what you should do. It's like being nagged to in exactly the manner their telling you NOT treat your child. It wouldn't have been that difficult to approach the psychology of motivating children with actual facts and dialog rather that the page after page of ""don't do"" this. Poorly written."
3,"Uneven, but definitely worthwhile","I think most people will agree that in the 70s, the Stones' albums weren't particularly cohesive -- there were moments of brilliance, surrounded by several so-so songs. That's the case with this album. If nothing else, buy it for the classic ""It's Only Rock and Roll,"" as well as the standouts ""If You Can't Rock Me"" and ""Luxury."" And keep in mind, the so-so songs aren't *that* bad -- these are the Stones, after all. :)"
2,Merely competent Stones,"When I was fifteen, this was my first Stones album. The year was 1988, and the last Stones album was Undercover *Shudder*. Except for the usual cadre of 10 songs heard on classic rock stations all the time in the Rust Belt, I had no idea that the Stones could make compelling music, and this album didn't help matters much. It took me years of bumbling around to find the really good stuff on the earlier albums. As for this taken on its own terms, there ARE some good songs here, peppered with filler. I particularly liked ""Time Waits for No one"" and ""Till the Next Goodbye."" Languid but good mid-tempo stuff. I also really enjoy ""Fingerprint File"", which at least sounded like they were trying something different. As opposed to the title track and most of the other songs on the album, which is more Stones-by-numbers than anything else."
2,"Undercover, Dirty Work, what's the difference?","In my review what I meant to say was the most recent Stones album in '88 was Dirty Work. I don't know, those albums all seem to blur together for me. Pardon my inaccuracy."
4,Far better than its predecessor,"A return to form, after the weak ""Goat's Head Soup."" Really, not a bad cut on the disc, although ""Till the Next Goodbye"" and ""If You Really Want to Be My Friend"" are not as well-written as the rest. Wonderfully muscular guitar tones abound throughout, and Mick's vocals are particularly strong. Guy Peelaert's classic cover art reflects the decadence still gloriously present in the Stones' music at the time - a must for fans of the band."
3,GOOD BUT NOT THEIR BEST,"ITS ONLY ROCK AND ROLL AND IF YOU CANT ROCK ME ARE AS FRESH AND BLISTERING AS ANY OF THEIR WORK,BUT THE REST OF THE ALBUM LACKS THEIR USUAL COVER TO COVER PUNCH.LUXURY IS A GREAT RAGGAE INFLUENCED GEM,AND FINGERPRINT FILE ALONE MAKE IT A MUST TO HAVE.YETWHILE JAGGER KEPT THE BAND GOING RICHARDS WAS TOO DRUGGED UP TO HELP AT THIS POINT.WHEN RICHARDS GOT OFF HEROIN IN 1978 THEIR LPS RETURNED TO POWERFULL FORM LIKE IN THE EARLY SEVENTIE. HOWEVER THE STONES WORST LPS ARE BETTER THAN MOST OTHERS BEST WORK."
3,"Not bad, but the great Stones era had ended by this time.","This is a pretty good album. I stress good, nothing more or less. After Exile on Main Street the Stones left their best stuff behind them, never to return in my opinion. Having said that, they have made some quality stuff in the last thirty years, here and there. This is one such example.The opening track ""If You Can't Rock Me"" harkens back to their best days and the title song along with ""Time Waits for No One"", ""Dance Little Sister"", and ""Till the Next Goodbye"" are all good. Oddly enough, the album contains one of my very favorite Stones songs in ""Fingerprint File"" (turn it up!). However, ""If You Really Want to Be My Friend"", and ""Short and Curlies"" seem out of place here and the former is just sappy and not a very good song. Don't expect greatness. Not even The Stones are perfect, although I know it's hard to believe."
4,Great cover and prototypical Stones,"Not a great rep for this one, but if EVERY Stones album were like this they'd be one of the best rock and roll bands ever. But they get blamed because 4 of the last 5 studio albums were just that much better. Life isn't always fair!"
5,Unter rated,this is a great rockin album by our favorite boys I like goats head soup but if it didn't excist I think that this would make 5 amazing albums in a row everything here is good maybe it is only rock n roll this time but hell you have mick taylor's last stand here doing what he does best and rock n roll is great stuff so i'm lovin this one.
3,Product,"This album is OK, but it's so bloodlessly contrived that it could be KISS. It's hard to believe that this is the same band that released the masterful ""Exile on Main Street"" just a couple of years before. But, to be fair, I imagine the mid-70s wasn't the most fertile time to nuture one's art -- you know, with all those, um, ""distractions""...."
3,Read,"The remastering is excellent. It is nicely cleaned up. I noticed that right away when listening. However, the artwork is identical? Why? I can't justify buying all these albums again. A lot of the albums don't deserve purchasing again especially with no new artwork or bonus songs. This was very lazy on their part. But, again the remastering is great and I will buy some of the other classics like Sticky Fingers."
3,Mick Taylor's departure was a big loss,"One of Mick Taylor's finest musical moments is TIME WAITS FOR NO ONE. But it's also the occasion for Mick Jagger's worst vocal moment. First he sings: ""Time can tear down a building."" Then he switches into his cockney-redneck bonehead accent and sings: ""Or destroy a woman's face."" With that doofus-dipthong on the word ""face"". It sounds so retarded and it's so unforgivable. It's arguably misogynistic in its insensitivity. It manages to be self-deprecating and misogynistic at the same time. It's the worst case of musical self-sabotage since John Lennon & George Harrison filtered the horn sections in GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING & SAVOY TRUFFLE to the point where they sound like kazoo sections."
1,IT'S ONLY THE SAME OLD STUFF,"THIS RECORD WAS THE ABSOLUTE BEGINING OF THE END FOR THESE GUYS! FROM THIS POINT ON EVERY RECORD HAD THE SAME OLD SOUND,THE SAME OLD BEAT, AND THE SAME OLD FORMULA! DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS,IF YOU HAVE HEARD ONE STONES ALBUM THAT THEY HAVE DONE IN THE LAST 25 YEARS,YOU HAVE HEARD THEM ALL!"
2,Stones Coasting Again,"Another from their first mediocre period. I'll be brief again. Good songs: Dance Little Sister, It's Only Rock N Roll. Not quite good enough: If You Can't Rock Me, Ain't Too Proud to Beg. Forget the rest. I speak the truth."
3,Going Through The Motions,"This is a Stones album which tries very hard to sound like a classic Stones album from the 60's but somehow it never fully catches fire. ""Luxury"" is a fine song but a lot of it feels as if they were playing in a haze. It has all of the elements of what a Stones album is expected to have (old Motown, classic rockers, blues, etc) but they were not able to throw it all together and produce a winner."
2,Wildly inconsistent,"There are 3 excellent songs here and a lot of professional, competent filler--but the Stones had been about rising above the merely competent. When this came out, I was hoping against hope that the Stones and other late 1960s heroes would be able to sustain their creativity and energy indefinitely. This is one of those albums which revealed that it was not to be. I could tangibly feel the late 1960s great rock music scene slipping away into a morass of mediocrity, and this album was one of the key exhibits in that downward slide. Of course by now the Stones have put out so many mediocre products since this album that it all becomes somewhat of a blur to a beginning listener, but this album was an important turning point in the band's deterioration."
4,A great Stones album,"It's only rock n roll is one of the finest albums from the Stones recorded in 1974.This album is just super and containing classics like title track,Fingerprint File and the awesome time waits for no one featuring a 3 minute guitar solo.This album is good and is very highly recommended."
4,A mixed bag.,"There is a lot to like in this album. After the string of brilliant and challenging albums that the Stones put out between 1967-1973, however, this one is kind of a letdown. While it has a batch of great tunes, the album really doesn't really pull itself together as a cohesive unit. It does the Motown thing, it does the Jamaican thing, it does the fun filler thing, it does the funk thing and it does the ballad thing. It's influx of styles and sometimes lazy production probably has something to do with Mick Taylor's growing disinterest with the band and Mick Jagger's growing interest in the mega-superstar lifestyle. As a serious album, it's good. As a testament to where the Stones when they reached the top of the heap, it's priceless. And as a album that is just one big grab bag of styles, it's a winner."
3,Just whistled in the wind..,"Leon was great as usual, however, the audio was not that great, seemed a little scratchy. And trust me I checked my unit that I used to listen on, and it was O.K. Didn't give any problems on any other of my C.D.'s. All of the C.D.""s I ordered, fell in the same category."
4,Leon Redbone: Steve Martin alter-ego,"This is a good album. Did you know that Leon Redbone and Steve Martin both appeared on Johnny Carson on the same night? But not together. Hmmmm! Also, they both appeared in the first season of Saturday Night Live, which is, I think, the last time I ever saw Steve play the banjo. Anyway, I'm buying Steve's newly released banjo CD to see how he sounds when he performs as himself.(I believe I'm right on this correlation, and I believe I am the first to have published this conclusion on the net, having done so several years ago.)"
3,Not enough pictures.,"I found this book not up to par with some other doll collecting guides I have. It doesn't have enough pictures. I don't know how the author came up with some of the values. -It seems she just searched Ebay to find what the dolls were worth, I could have done that."
4,I've become a fan just this year. It is a fine show.,"She fills a void, she reminds me of a female Ray Charles, vocally giving it her all with solid musical backing. It'd be nice if it was longer and I wish she'd always have a live version of At Last on any live release but that's in the box set. This is worth getting if you're a fan of her's, you will not be disappointed. Well recorded. You can feel her passion. God bless."
5,GREAT CD,"I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF ETTA JAMES,AND HAVE ENJOYED BOTH ASPECTS OF HER CAREER: HER EARLIER DAYS AS A SWEET VOICED SINGER, AND HER LATER YEARS AS A GRAVEL VOICED FEMALE BLUES SHOUTER. ALTHOUGH SOME OF HER LATER RECORDINGS HAVE NOT BEEN AS ""INSPIRED"" AS THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN, THIS ONE IS. SHE GETS DOWN AND DIRTY AND SOUNDS AS GOOD AS SHE EVER HAS ON THIS CD, AND THE REASON FOR IT IS THE LIVE VENUE SHE WAS PLAYING IN. SOMETIMES SHE EVEN CONJURES UP IMAGES OF BIG MAYBELLE OR BIG MAMA THORNTON. GREAT CD, WITH GREAT BACKUP AS WELL AS HER SINGING. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF ETTA JAMES, THIS ONE IS WORTH PICKING UP."
1,Etta Live from San Fran,"For a woman who is wonderful live (Watch her special on Austin City Limits) This was a tepid at best performance.For some reason they got rid of the horn section and the band just sounded weak behind her.While its not perfect, the concert live at the House of Blues blows this one away."
2,"Outdated info., Not informative for captive/handfed birds!",This book was obviously written at a time when most Conures were imported from the wild and not captive bred or handfed. A large portion of this book deals with how to acclimate and taim a wild or unfriendly bird. Furthermore this book is not a good companion for the Conure owner looking to find information on a particular species. Many of the species covered in this book are not even avalible as pets or to be imported into the U.S. When I finally came to the section on the bird I was interested in purchasing all I found were the physical characteristics with nothing about its general temperment as a pet. This was hardly helpful as I knew exactly what the bird looked like but little else. Another topic of no use to me was the detailed information on the breeding of Conures. I am looking for a better source of information and would not reccommend this book to the average pet owner.
1,"Out dated, Breeding orientend.","There is to much focus on breeding Conure's, the info there is about keeping a Conure as a pet is outdated, I would reccomend the book on Conure's by Julie Rach instead!Hope this helps!"
4,...best Genesis romance...,Kayla and Allen dated for three years when he decided to end their relationship. They both married on the rebound to people they didn't love. After ten years fate has brought them back together to see if they can make it work a second time around.This is one of the best Genesis romance novels I have ever read (I read it in three days). The characters were well developed and the flashback were so well written it was like reading a movie.Ms. Keaton did a great job with this book and I look forward to reading her next novel. -JaT
2,Ugh... Okay,"I liked the storyline, however, things happened way too fast.!Allen appears out of nowhere.Kayla ups and forgives him after one apology.Next thing you know, they're in love.What happen to the chase.???It also seemed like Daniel, Allen's son, was forgotten about.You don't hear about him too much.It was an okay book, but I wouldn't recommend to anyone.Sorry."
5,Bobby D Review,Ms. Keaton did a wonderful job of developing the characters in this story through present action as well as flashbacks. She allowed us access to the minds of the main characters (Kayla and Allen). It was very important to understand how they both arrived at the points they were when we met them. The refreshing aspect of this novel is that it does not allow you to get bogged down within the typical romance theme. She incorporated serious real life issues which any person might experience at some point in his or her life. I say Kudos to Barbara Keaton for writing a wonderful piece and hopefully there will be more works in the future.
2,A Short Read with Lots of Info,This short book gives lots of information and beautiful colored pictures.I recommend this book to give new or potential collectors a crash course in mourning jewelry.
3,small book needs more material and larger pictures,When I first saw the reviews I was expecting a large hard bound book of at leat 100 pages. It was a small paperback book. I was hoping to have more indept text and greater diversity of items in the morning jewlery catagory. Not a bad book and does have nice pictures. I was just looking for more information than was provided and larger pictures.
5,This is so light and refreshing!,"This is the kind of scent you put in the refrigderator and whenyou need a pick me up it not only cools you off, it scents you with a burst of scent that will uplift the hottest of summer days or nights, and just leave you smelling fresh and great!LOVE IT~"
4,"Measure twice, order once","Product and directions were great - very easy to follow. One problem I had with the 6.5"" surrounds is that I did not notice that the diameter of the speaker cone in my application was only 4.25"" until after I removed the old foam, that is the same as the interior diameter of the foam surround (so there is no ""overlap"" that could be glued together). I reached out to parts express to see if they had another surround that would work for me. They didn't, but they did refer me to another supplier, The Speaker Exchange [...] that had a few more options that would have worked for me. I also found[...] and ended up ordering the F6-1 to fix the front door Mark Levinson component woofers in a Lexus LS430. Everything is now back together in my car and sounding great -- saved a whole lot of money as these are expensive speakers and replacements for a decent 8 ohm car speaker are hard to find these days."
5,Great Product for Repairing expensive old speakers.,Let me just say that I was so happy to find this product. It kept me from having to buy new speakers to fit inside the beautiful wood casing of my Altec Lansing speakers. Everything worked perfectly as I followed directions carefully. Now these speakers can keep playing fantastic sounds for decades to come.
4,excusions in archaeology,"Imagine it is the year 2890...what little is left of the waste of Earth begins to be collected by the remnants of humanity. Among the trash, tainted and half decayed itself, yet a gleam of beauty still shining through, is this album...origin unknown, imperfect, somehow touching something a bit deeper...almost precious. >>>> Nothing is straightforward about this record, and herein lies much of its value. Unimposing throughout, yet leaving much to speculate, eroded rhythms fade in and out of pastiched fabrics of sound, often beautiful, usually unreckognizable. Great for background music if you believe in the aesthetic of flowers pushing the mortar from brick walls. More eclectic than electric, but fitting into both catagories...Not a journey, yet not a simple stroll...alot of things and yet not much of anything..."
4,Trick needed to play PAL dvd's on US TV,"Although the manual and description state that this player automatically switches between PAL and NTSC, it does not at first. When you start using it, the NTSC dvd's will play fine, but the PAL may appear colorless (almost black and white).Since this product is not intended for the US market, Pioneer USA does not support it. (They don't even have the manual).Trough forums online we found the solution: Hold the ""ON"" button and the ""Fast Forward"" button simultanuously for a few seconds, when turning the unit on. Eventhough it shows ""NTSC"" in the display, it was now able to play both formats perfectly in color and switches between PAL and NTSC automatically. Even after turning the DV-383-s off, and back on.Other than this 'flaw', it seems to be a very compatible player and a good deal for that price."
5,Very enjoyable,"I look forward every couple of months to a new Outlanders novel and the last two, Dragoneye in particular, really was worth the wait. It was very enjoyable and exciting. I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys adventure and science fiction!"
3,Getting tiring,"I've read all of the books in the Outlanders series and I have to say at this point it's getting pretty monotonous to read all the explanations of past events and characters. I think that this is great for those new to Outlanders, but for us die-hards it leaves us with 60% new story and 40% rehash. For those growing tired of Outlanders I strongly recommend StarFist. StarFist is written by two former military men, which greatly adds to the descriptions of characters, battle scenes, weapons, etc."
5,Nava Rules,"Michael Nava became one of my favorite authors with this book. He tells a tight twisted mystery that leaves one guessing ""whodunnit?"" until the very end. Besides being a prolific mystery writer, Nava infuses his stories with a real world mentality that is absent from many other authors (but hey I love escapism as much as the next person!). The reader wanting to grow with Henry Rios (Nava's main character) needs to start here and read the other books in this series. You will come to love Henry for his battles, both personal and public, and become emotionally attached to the character when he sometimes loses. A dynamic book taht makes all of us ask the question ""Why?"" of the world around us."
3,Good writing style but clunky plotting,"Michael Nava is a very good writer. He's got an interesting writing style and does particularly well with dialogue. The problem with this novel, however, is the story telling. The plot is awkwardly constructed, and there are no surprises. Once Nava gets a better handle on plotting he should prove to be an excellent crime novelist."
5,Reflection of life leads to Enlightenment,This was a great story of self. The central theme carries throughout the book. Kardos does a great job showing us in everyday activity we can become closer to ourselves in reflection that eventually leads to enlightenment. The charactors are real and make you feel you are part of the story. An excellent read.
4,PartKeller,Interesting collection of songs. Sounds great. So what's wrong - the compilation runs from song to song without pauses. Some songs even overlap. It's like listening to some AM stations or a disco compilation.
4,Gowns are OK,"The print on the gowns is kind of dull and the print is not that sexy; however, the gowns are true to size and fit nicely"
3,Cute but big,These say one size fits all but they are huge. I had to alter the straps to fit and they still don't fit right and look huge and I'm not a tiny person. I wear a 12-13 normally.
2,A British series,"I found the show very disappointing, I love the book but this series is hard to follow, isn't true to the book and filled with poor actors."
1,"Truly, truly awful","What the author is trying to do is apparently some sort of anti-establishment post-modern literature carried by absurdist dark humor. The problem is the artist can't draw and the writers can't write and they think the suffering of their central characters passes for humor. There is no plot, just random acts of macabre violence. There are no characters, just stick figures to whom the violence occurs. A six-year old could draw better and come up with a better story and really, only someone on that level of maturity would find this book remotely interesting."
5,The Millenium Falcon of Tangerine Dream,"In 1982 when I asked my audio equipment dealer for some good ""space"" music, he pulled out a TD album called ""White Eagle"" and said ""try this"". 17 years later and I still can't get enough! If you want to blast into the great unknown for the best musical space flight of your life, get this CD. It is just as good as the original LP album. And if you're a big TD fan, you will love the hyper- intensity and thrust of this album."
4,The Good stuff,"I just read that this album followed the disappointing ""Exit"". I was quite pleased with this album, it is almost worthy of the same praise as the earlier TD, though here they use better equipment and it's not so experimental (improvisational) though still inspired. This album does take you away, the soundscapes don't sound contrived or forced, the writing is good and the sounds and production excellent, and performances more inspired than the lifeless ""Exit"". I recommend this over Force Majeur or Hyperborea."
5,A Great Book,"This is a clearly written and very informative overview of American church history. Highly recommended.Professor Irving Hexham, Department of Religious Studies, University of Calgary"
2,American Church Experience,"The book in itself is interesting for anyone wanting to research the religious history and some of the foundations of different movements. However, the book I purchased, though it looked new, it was quite disappointing to see that many of the pages on the right side of the book were unreadable because they were mostly erased."
1,"Decent book, poor publishing","I had to read this book for a college class. The authors did a good job presenting the material. However, many of the pages were not even readable. The book was brand new, but the text on the pages looked as if it had been erased or just not printed with enough ink. I was terribly disappointed to have spent $28 for a book that every 4th page I couldn't even read."
4,Great mix cd,"I'm generally not a big fan of these types of discs but this one is quite infectious and addictive. Standout Tracks includ Sun is Shining as well as Track 1. Contains a lot of the tracks that they are playing out there in the clubs right now, mostly with a hard trance beat. Definitly worth it, especially if you are a fan of others in the the series."
3,Mix CD are only as good as the DJ that creates them.,"Mix CDs are only as good as the DJ that selects the tracks and creates the mixes. If you like TGN2 check out TGN4 or Crystal Volume 2 (all mixed by DJ Nicholas Bennison). Nicholas has made a name for himself with his incredible track selections and technical mixing abilities. TGN2 was mixed by Nicholas although the track selection was laid out by the TGN lable. TGN4 is a better example Nicholas Bennison's superb style. While your at it, check out Crystal Volume 1 by DJ Plastic, another L.A. based artist that, like Nicholas is taking the world by storm. If your into cutting edge underground music Nicholas is the perfect guide."
2,"not what i expected at all, far worse than TGN2","The first CD that I owned from the tranceglobalnation series was vol. 2. That CD was absolutely superb. I enjoyed every last song on the disc. Thinking that this CD was just as good, I went to sam goody and bought it. What a waste!! this has the most repetitive loops ive ever heard. Maybe one or two good songs but does not compare to TGN2 at all!"
1,Cheaply Made,It broke after the third firing. A plastic piece near the grip shattered. I am not impressed and will never encourage someone to buy this item.
5,Great book,I bought this book to learn more about these ships and this is great. Has a lot of good technical info on them and a great amount on their history. I recomend this for anyone that wants to learn more on these ships.
1,Tickled my gag reflex!,"This has NONE of the passion of the tango. This abhorration is Saturday Night Fever goes to Argentina. I found nothing redeeming. Generally, when I write reviews they are positive. However, in this case, I could not let anyone else be duped into purchasing this...!"
3,Black and Blue All Over,"I really can't say any more than some of the other top reviewers. The Stones Black and Blue is definitely one of their most over-looked gems. Sitting right between It's Only Rock and Roll ('74) and the ever-popular Some Girls ('78) it is a transitional album. Changes were happening. From guitarist's to production managers, it all has an effect. Personally I liked it. Sure there is some funky raggae style tunes here, but also some real classic Stones. Fool to Cry is probably the most well known song from Black and Blue as it made the Forty Licks compilation. The best thing is, these Virgin records '94 remaster's are a Bargain! I got this brand new for under $10. And it sounds great. Matches up perfectly with the quality of Forty Licks so you can mix and match your favorite songs (maybe on an ipod) and not hear major differences. You don't want to live without Memory Motel, Hand of Fate, and Crazy Mama! Rock ON!"
3,Some Nice Grooves But Somewhat Incomplete,"The grooves and riffs are quiete catchy and even danceable. However, many of the eight tracks hardly qualify as songs as the melodies consist of the same progression beaten over and over and over again. One could think that something is wrong with the CD towards the end of Hot Stuff. Melody has some catchy piano embellishments but suffers a similar fate. For the band which claimed to be Only About Rock N Roll, there seems to be a shortage of it here. A dissappointment but a catchy dissappointment at that."
2,A low point,"With one exception, this is product, not music. Everything is either a self-parody of things they did better earlier (""Crazy Mama,"" ""Hand of Fate"") or an attempt to reinfuse some life by using other genres like jazz or reggae or country. A good strategy but their hearts weren't in it. Memory Motel is the only fresh thing on the album."
1,Hot Stuff?,"This record is awful. When I was a kid, I couldn't make it past ""Hot Stuff"" without barfing.This one is definately the Stones at their lowest point, even more so than Dirty Work, Undercover, and Satanic Majesties Request."
1,Dud,"This is a tired album low on energy and ideas. The few songs are stretched out too long to make up for the lack of material. Too much of it is flabby, weak, bland, dull. Only ""Hand of Fate"" and ""Crazy Mama"" have a spark of life to them. It's difficult for me to believe that one could listen to ""Exile on Main St."" or ""Let It Bleed"" and then listen to this album and still call it a good album. You'd have to be a Stones fanatic who had lost all perspective on quality to praise this turkey."
3,Blue Man Group,"Recorded in a half-dozen sessions from December 1974 to February 1976, the album - released on April 23, 1976 - ultimately introduced Ron Wood as the replacement to Mick Taylor and featured some of the weakest songwriting to find its way to vinyl.The funk on Hot Stuff, reggae in Cherry Oh Baby, jazz-influence with Melody, the arena rock anthem to the road - Memory Motel - and rocker, Crazy Mama, have the vibe, but ultimately lack a real punch.The ballad, Fool to Cry, is a sublime classic, but simply cannot save what is a rocky ride after the groove."
5,Funky rock dancing with brillance,"This ""recruiting"" album really lays the beat down. The interplaying between Wyman and Watts is among the best here. All tracks are great, especially the ones that were left off and made it on Tattoo You: ""Slave,"" ""Worried About You."" If these two were on this album, it would be regarded a bit more highly than it is at the moment. Yet, they got even better with Some Girls. This cd/album is where they found themselves after the 73/74 albums, not Some Girls."
1,It Was Time To Retire,"I do have this album ( unfortunately ). The 'Boys' starting heading into uncharted waters without a compass on this one. They got away from what they were good at and tried a hand at reggae. Glad they didnt try it again, huh? I can't think of one good song here and this is coming from a fan who saw them live in '65. Too much 'after concert partying I guess'. Time to hang it up THEN!!!!!"
2,So So Stones,"A few good songs (Memory Motel, Hand of Fate) and lots of filler. Enjoyable as an artifact of mid 70's rock and a pretty good example of the directionless and trendy music being produced at that point in time.Would be considered a good album for lesser bands, for the Stones it ranks as one of their worst. But perhaps they needed to bottom out before they could rebound and produce superior efforts such as Some Girls and Emotional Rescue."
2,Hot Stuff?,"The first time I heard Black And Blue it didnt catch me the way the other Rolling Stones albums did. I was really shocked how much their sound changed sounding reggae, disco, and funkish. But in all respects the jamming on the songs was extensive. Black And Blue was released in 1976, this was the first album of Mick Taylor's departure. The new axeman (guitarist) was Ron Wood. I think this album was good for two reasons the jams, and because their was the Rolling Stones. This is one of the worst!"
1,Hand of Fate - That's It.,To the point again. One decent song. The Stones at their worst during their Jet Set days.
2,They couldnt come up with more than 8 songs?,"The sad thing about this album is there was so many unreleased great songs floating around at this time and they only finished 8. And most of them are pretty weak. Memory motel and Crazy mama are the best songs and they arent even considered great Stones songs but on this album they are. I guess because they were in between guitarists at the time they just werent into it as much , but Mick Taylor is pretty much on most of the songs but Ron wood is in the pictures. Anyway dont get this cd, its not worth it."
3,Don't believe what you've heard,"Rock critics like to point to this album as evidence of the Stones decline in the late 70's and 80's. I, being a rabid stones fan, would to disagree. 'Black and Blue' is a transitional album featuring superb lead guitar on songs like 'hand of fate' and 'hot stuff'. Of course, there are the obligatory album throwaways like 'hey negrita' and the reggae tune, 'cherry oh baby'. These are the only two let downs however. The strong point of the album is its diverdity with songs ranging from ballads ('fool to cry') to jazz ('melody'). My personal faveorite is 'crazy mama' . There are other good listens here as well including 'hand of fate', 'hot stuff', and 'memory motel'. Overall, it is a good but not great album."
5,Most underrated Stone's album,"Black and Blue is classic Stones, filled with rockers, ballads and blues. I never get tired of this album--great music for cruising down the Parkway with the top down."
2,A Bruiser,"""Hot Stuff"" is obnoxious, but ""Hand of Fate"" is a lot better, one of only 3 great songs on this LP. ""Memory Motel"" is a nice sentimental song (with a duet between Mick and Keith), and ""Crazy Mama"" is a fun rocker. Fair is ""Melody"" (an attempt to try jazz, but a little redundant). ""Cherry oh Baby"" is a poor attempt to go reggae. ""Hey Negrita"" is boring, and ""Fool to Cry"" is horrible. Is it any wonder this isn't too many people's favourite?"
3,Not as bad as you've been lead to believe,"Okay, they were auditioning guitar players and there isn't a lot of focus to this, but its highs are very good, notably ""Memeory Motel"", ""Fool to Cry"" and ""Crazy Mama"". And, occasionally, I feel the need to hear ""Hot Stuff."" All right? I've admitted it. But they had to do ""Hot Stuff"" to get to ""Miss You.""Buy it used."
3,Mixed Bag,"A couple of great songs harking back to their earlier peak and several pointing to the relative experimention of their next (and final) decent sequence of albums in Girls, Rescue, Tattoo. So in the context of their previous album, the atrocious It's Only Rock and Roll, it's probably a reasonable return to form.But inclusion of the long and boring ballads break up the energy and flow of the album (although like an earlier reviewer I agree that it's a good album to listen to in the car because Memory Motel doesn't sound 7:06 when you're concentrating on something else!).For existing fans only (ie sad folk like us who bother writing about something almost 25 years old)."
2,Weak lyrics,The music is good but the lyrics are so bad. Hot Stuff has to be one of the worst stones songs out there. The album gets 2 stars because of Memory Motel. Fool To Cry and Hand of Fate are good and Memory Motel is one of their best songs. The rest of the album is barely listenable.
4,Loose,"It's not on the top of anyone's Stones list, but this vastly underrated 70's release is the Stones at their loosest (and hence best). It was the end of a run of great releases, from Sticky Fingers through Exile on Main Street. And you can hear them stretching out into the reggae rhythms that enticed rich white Englishmen with their leisurely stomps and social politics. Out of 8 tracks, 5 are Stones classic, the remaining three better than anything else they did for most of the decade that followed. So if you don't have it, the only question is Why?"
3,The beginning of a new chapter for the Rolling Stones,"Every song on 'Black & Blue' has its moments of brilliance. 'Hot Stuff' offers a fresh rhythm, 'Memory Motel' outlines a compelling story and 'Melody' is a prime example of the Stones' use of humor. The drawback of this album is that many of the songs are extended far too long - and often risk losing listener interest.The glimmering exception to this observation is 'Hey Negrita' - a guitar-driven jam that does not overstay its welcome. Mixing elements of reggae, surf rock and funk, this track demonstrates the Stones' ability to embrace new musical styles without losing their distinct sound.Overall, I would encourage every Rolling Stones fan to listen to this album. It would not be long before Mick & the boys would refine the elements presented here into a wildly successful follow-up album."
3,"""Black and Blue indeed...""","The Stones sound a little beat up on this one and a tad out of sorts. I would never recommend this cd to someone just getting into the Stones but it is worth having for us diehards. ""Crazy Mama"" rocks pretty good. ""Fool to Cry"" is a good song highlighted by Mick's falsetto. The real keeper on this cd is ""Memory Motel"" which I've always thought stood along side with any of the great slow Stones songs and the single reason this cd gets 3 stars instead of 2."
1,Chemistry : Concepts & Applications,"If this book were for me, I would gladly review it but I bought it for a friend who plans to take the appropriate tests for becoming a science teacher in high school. I have rated it at one star because I know very little about the book contents and the review will not go through unless I do a rating! Maybe someone needs to add ""Don't know"" as a category."
3,a plus,"This book was ok, after all it did help my wife deal with the drama that comes with a toxic baby's mama. However, some advice given is questionable. Over all i'd say this book was helpful."
1,no more,"This book was heartless. The title should have been ""No more child support payments, please, I may have to cut out my dance lessons in the city."""
1,Did not work!,"I have used this product in the past and it worked wonderfully. This time, I am not sure if something has changed with manufacturing, however, the product was thin and did not fit correctly even with measuring before ordering. The product did not keep my cast dry and in fact the cast was soaked. Probably had a hole. Due to the fact that I had just had surgery, I did not have the energy or non-drugged state of mind to return. I did attempt to call the company and they said that I had to go through the seller. Too much work for this product which was only to be used for a few weeks. Would not buy again."
1,Did not keep the water out,I purchased this item to cover a half cast and surgical site. I had a real difficult time getting it to form a good seal. The top would roll down making a tourniquet like effect. Out of 6 attempts I only had a good seal to prevent water 1 time and it about cut the circulation off.
5,"Buy this 2004 edition, not the 2001 edition!","This is an excellent review book for Spanish language learners.Be aware that there is an earlier edition which you should most definitely NOT buy:Repaso: A Complete Review Workbook for Grammar, Communication, and Culture(2001), and that the publisher has included no answer key in either edition but has published them separately and made it very difficult to match them up.Moreover, the 2001 answer key is completely out of print and impossible to find anywhere on the web. Trust me, I've tried!The answer key the goes with this 2004 edition of the book isRepaso A Review Workbook for Grammar, Communication, and Culture ANSWER KEYwith ISBN number 0078607086 and can be found readily."
1,Doesn't hold the charge,"Looks and fits in camera well, but after full charging there is no power left after 3 days. So it doesn't hold the charge."
1,You get what you pay for.,"Well, my SD10 was in need of a new battery recently, so I checked amazon and found 2 options. The ""official"" battery pack by canon for around $40, or this gem for about $3. This thing is brand new and it holds a charge for about as long as the dead battery we were replacing... I'm not sure if I got a lemon but I don't feel like trying to get a whopping $3 refund, to me this item is pretty much a waste of money."
5,Great Replacement Battery!,I just got this battery about 2 weeks ago and it is great! It is also great for the price. I bought a different battery at BB for $45 and the charge hardly lasted! So I returned it and ordered this one. I took over 200 pictures this past weekend and have not had to charge my battery yet. Great!
2,Canon Battery,"I got the Ultralast UL NB3L Canon NB -3L camera battery and I have been using it since I got it, it has been a few weeks now, but last night when I took my camera and wanted to charge the battery, the battery would not pop out. So now I have to go fix it somewhere."
1,poorly made bulldog face,"The Webkinz Bulldog I purchased had a poorly made face. The eyes were not correctly placed in the head and the jowls didn't look like the picture....or any bulldog I've ever seen. I was very disappointed. It wasn't worth the return shipping price. My first Webkinz purchase (the springer spaniel) was very well made. Now, I'm afraid to make a third Webkinz purchase."
3,Fad,"I am glad to give this to my daughter, but this fad is ridiculous. Too many gimicks these days. Cute puppy."
5,Very cute-it will make you happy!,I bought this for a friend's granddaughter. I opened the package and almost didn't want to wrap it up for her. It was so cute that I wanted to keep it but I didn't. It's great because there are no removable parts that a child or a pet could swallow. Thank you again Amazon-you get it right every time!
2,You can't see its eyes!,"Everything about it is good except for the fact that you can't see the eyes, the fabric hangs over the eyes so you can see them"
4,cute,My son actually bought this dog because he wanted to go on to Webkinz. He was a little disappointed with the way it looked when he got it. He thought it would be a little softer. It is cute and he does have fun on Webkinz. It seems durable and a good choice for a boy or Bulldog lovers.
4,Adorable!,The bulldog is as cute as in the picture. I didn't expect a giant Webkinz so I'm not sure why people are complaining. I know my son will love it.
5,Captivating and suspenseful,"A great read! Magnuson does an interesting job of interweaving the facts of the actual Tokyo sarin gas attacks with the fictional story of a young couple--one of whom becomes a cult member who helps carry out the attacks. The historical context of the novel gives it a richness and believabilty that takes it to another level.This is a well-written, suspenseful novel that you'll find hard to put down."
4,"Enjoyable, Not Terrible","I enjoyed this installment of Agatha. If nothing else, we were spared the odious James this time round. I think Charles is better than him - at least he's true to a type! Agatha gets involved with a handsome hairdresser from a neighbouring village in this story. Then she finds out that he is not as he seems. She pieces together that he has been blackmailing middle-aged women. Agatha tries to prove the blackmail, but in the meantime Mr. John is poisoned. Agatha and Charles set out to find the killer. Agatha is really very appealing in this story. Her vulnerability is charming to me, as she tries to hide it in her usual bluster."
3,This lost it umph at the end....,This book was really great and it seemed to loose something at the end.I love all the characters Agatha Raisin is in contact with.
4,Another great Raisin adventure!,"True to form, Agatha gets herself in hot water with both the police and a murderer as she tries to solve the case."
2,Agatha seems to be going downhill,"I was not impressed with this latest Agatha Raisin mystery. M.C. Beaton seemed to be writing to fulfill a contract. I found the book to be predictable, the obsession with James wearying--especially since he was nowhere to be found in the book--and quite a few loose ends that were never tied together. Agatha seemed to have lost her spunk. I hope the next Agatha gives us a little more!"
4,Good Event but the price is way too much,"I've seen this event and it is good but this is too much to pay,Most of the matches are good, even the match between Hogan and Piper is ok. If you can get it used for cheaper, go for it."
3,OK,"I liked the malenko-syxx, outsiders-giant, ddp-buff, mysterio-prince, and the six man tag matches all the rest were boring! The Jericho vs. Eddie match wasn't too bad but they didn't seem like they were in it. The piper hogan match... do we have to see this again? Buy it... but don't pay $50"
2,"It was okay, but not as good as I Hoped",My favorite guy is DDP I like him in any match. He should be world champ
4,superbrawl 7 a BREATHTAKING EXPEIRCENCE,THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PPVS HOGAN VS. PIPER A CLASSIC SIX MAN LUCHA LIBRE MATCH HIGH FLYING MY FAVORITE MATCH BENOIT VS .SULLVAIN IN A SAN FRANSISCO DEATH MATCH THIS IS ONE TO OWN!!!!!
5,Uplifting and Spirited,"Carolyn Dawn Johnson's single Georgia is one of the finer country songs that I have heard. Raised on country my entire life it is refreshing to hear such a wonderful song by a talented young lady. ""Georgia"" caught my ear the very moment i heard the first note on the radio and has since then been embedded into my head. All musics fans, even those non country folks, can appreciate this song and Carolyn's talent. I am eagerly waiting the release date of Carolyn's first CD as I am sure many others are as well."
5,Waiting For Santa staring BARNEY,"My young grandaughter just had to watch it daily. We allowed it because it brought fourth a good message to little ones. She also enjoyed it because she could sing the ""Family song"" with 'Barney' as well as her cousins and me. She learned to memorize words and act out things so well that her heart was just broken when her Video broke! So I am getting her one for this Christmas. I think it was one of the better videos of Barneys.This 'Waiting For Santa' has also been her most favorite."
2,disappointed,"I was really expecting a better picture with this camera. I have a vivitar 3615, 2.1 mega pixel that actual takes a better picture."
1,Do not buy this camera,This camera's quality is really poor. The pictures are horrible in anything but perfect light. It broke in one week!! The lens became covered in mist due to humidity in California. That is ridiculous! I have returned it to Amazon and still waiting for news form them.
3,cute and easy camera,"this camera has a lot going for it. it comes with software and cable and takes great little pictures for a 3.0mp. however, even though the price looks right, you must still buy a good battery and a memory card, which adds up. also, i was shooting pictures with a friend with a 4.0mp camera and her shots were considerably better, especially in color quality. all in all it meets my needs for compact size and ease."
4,Awesome Camera,"I so love the size and shape of this camera. This one takes some good pictures, and appear to be quite clear. It's better than the integrated camera on my cell phone. This camera may seem like it's taken a poor quality image, but when you transfer them onto a pc, they seem so clear! However it is recommended that you get a memory card for this camera as it only has 14mb of internal memory. As this camera was a gift to me, I'd have to say it was the best birthday present I have received!"
1,THIS SUCKS.,"(im actually 14 but im using the kid thing, haha.)THIS CAMERA IS [...]. All of the pictures turn out way too bright! People look pure WHITE!! I can't stand it. And the pictures were really fuzzy and undetailed, too. Usually I don't get another camera until mine breaks... but this one was so bad I had to go buy a new one!DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. CRAPPIEST CAMERA EVER."
4,Question,"i am wondering, if anyone who would know if there is a mount or a bracket type to mount this in the car, maybe some sort of strap it can be attached to, so my kids can watch this DVD player on road trips? Any information would be great.Thanks much !"
1,Piece of Trash,"Do NOT buy this DVD player. I got one last August; it lasted for about 4 or 5 weeks before the screen went. After complaining and waiting for nearly two months, I was sent a new one. That one lasted me from November until March, when the power input wasn't working properly. I'd plug in the power cord and the connection was so poor that I'd have to shake the cord to get it to work for a few seconds to a minute or two at a time. Next, the button to recognize that the lid was closed wouldn't work, so I fixed this by putting electrical tape on the lid to force the button down. Now, the stupid thing will not play most discs (Simpsons Season 4 brand new, for example) and often skips, which is strange because I keep electronics and DVDs/CDs/games in excellent condition.Long story short, spend the extra money and get something that will last for more than a few months at most."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this particular DVD player at Best Buy, and while it does what it's supposed to do, which is play DVDs, its build quality is mediocre at best. With a 4 year warranty in hand, I've had to replace my unit 4 times now. Problems include - no audio from speakers, black and white picture instead of color on the screen, and recently, the lid just won't close. If you want a cheap DVD player, you probably cannot do better than this. I highly recommend getting an extended warranty though. It'll definitely pay for itself in the long run."
1,Buy the Warranty or buy a better player,We bought this unit for car trips with the kids. It worked for a few trips and 3 months but now no longer functions. The screen is jumbled and the sound is only strange noises. If you buy this unit I recommend an extended warranty or to buy another unit with more quality. Even when it worked the quality was OK at best.
2,poor quality,I bought this player and had some problem with it so they exchanged it for me since it was less than 3 months. Now it does not work at all. They say that if it is more than a year they will replace it for $99. I would rather put a few more dollars and buy some other company DVD player.I will never purchase from Polaroid again!
2,sound with no picture,"We bought it for a plane trip from MN to FL. It worked fine both down and back and even about an hour when we were there. Once we were back home, on day 31 I fired it up to get sound with a black/blank screen. I was afraid it held only a 30 day warranty, and I'd be stuck. Fortunately I was able to return (purchased from a different vendor) with no problem for a full refund.We bought headphones but didn't use them. It was loud enough for my toddler to hear the movie without disrupting the other passengers. She refused to wear the headphones - which was no surprise.It served it's purpose - but wasn't a good deal in the end. I did not choose to replace it."
1,"No matter what, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!","I wish I had read other reviews before buying this product. The price looks great ($200), but it is you who pays in the end. Apparently, my dvd player lasted longer than most in these reviews (6 months), but I only used it 10-20 times. First the color picture started going black and white intermittantly, then the power supply started to fail, and finally it will no longer play discs of any kind. After contacting the company, I was told it is no longer under warranty, and guess what? The repair costs would be as much as replacing the player itself. I will never purchase another Polaroid product again!!! And I hope this review saves someone else money, time, and angish."
1,Polaroid - shipped 2 defective models,This machine was great except that the color died out within 30 days. Amazon replaced it within 48 hours and the next one was defective as soon as I took it out of the box. The picture would turn black almost immediately. If you jiggled it a little the picture MIGHT come back. Back-to-back models were defective. Not impressed with Polaroid now.
2,save your money.,"I actually recieved (not this model) a Polaroid PDV-0701A for Christmas, which is the same in almost every way. I followed the directions and charged it for five hours. I started watching a movie (Finding Nemo, I think) and got about halfway through when it froze. The screen froze and you could hear the disc stop spinning. This has happened with every DVD i've used, sometimes damaging the DVD so now I can't use it in a regular DVD player. Now whenever I put any kind of CD or DVD in, it spins one or two times and comes up with a ""No Disc"" message. I haven't used it that often, so it is out of warranty and Polaroid is absolutely no help. Polaroid makes great cameras, but STEER CLEAR OF OTHER POLAROID ELECTRONICS!!"
3,Broken Case,"I love the DVD player, however suddenly a hairline crack in the case developed. Yesterday I opened the screen to watch a movie and the lid was partially disconnected from the unit. Two screws were out we were able to push the unit back today, however it won't close and keeps popping out. The screws must go inside as we can't see where to put them.Even through all of this, the unit continues to play movies. The review for playing is 5 stars. I am so disappointed the case is made of plastic. It couldn't handle the opening and closing of the monitor. The review for this is a 1."
1,polaroid DVD,I bought one and returned it directly to polaroid because it stopped working. I had to pay to send it back. I received another unit and within 2 weeks it broke again. I sent 3 units back because they did not work properly. The last one i was told to send back the unit with 110.00 and they would replace. I will never buy and polaroid product again. I had to throw dvd player in trash.
1,Will break!,"I bought this unit in August 2003. I take very good care of my things and I am very delicate with electronics and never really had a problem with them until I got the PDV-0700. I used it a few hours per week unitl October when all of a sudden, it would not play DVDs anymore. The screen would go half black half white every time it would be turned on. Lucky for me the warranty at that point covered the repair. They had to change the screen. Then it was good for another few months, until the new screen stopped working too. I am very disappointed. I payed hard earned money for a unit I was able to use for less than a year. I decided to go and buy a higher quality, more expansive unit from a more established brand in the dvd player market. I now wish I had done this from the start."
1,"0 stars, if I could.","A relative of mine got me this for Christmas, and I was sooo excited. I watched one movie on it...and the DVD player would turn off and on.This stopped once I put the player on a flat surface. I've had this problem several times since I recieved it, even after I put the player on a flat surface. Today, I was watching a DVD I recieved for my birthday on a car trip.And the picture froze. We tried everything. Cleaning the lens, the disk, the screen. After my mom had finished cleaning the disk, the player didn't turn on.Nothing. It just stopped. No matter how many times we pushed the on and off switch, and no matter how many times we switched the disk, the screen didn't go on.I've had this for less than a month, and it's already broken."
2,"Does not support burned DVD""s","The description on Amazon says it supports both -R and +R but no where in the documentation does it state that it supports these formats. Most of the disks I have are burned copies of scratched originals and none of them play. They all skip and stop after several minutes. Commercial dvd's seem to work fine. I have had the unit 6 months with no problems with the commercial DVD's. I am, however very disappointed in the false listing as I can rarely use the player now."
2,"Not the best in its price category, can be defective","I didn't like this player for 3 reasons:1. Earlier I had a CyberHome 700B, and this Polaroid's LCD picture quality is inferior to that one. One of my favorite tests is an amazing aerial combat scene with fast action and explosions above snowy mountains. This player showed too much blue overall, and the few greens of the film didn't come through. The orange-red explosions were bluntly lacking detail. So, I think the color balance and color range is worse than usual.2. The setup menus have fancy icons but small text that is hard to read due to pixelation.3. My unit had several defective pixels on the LCD (not smudge on the glass). There was a constantly gray pixel and two blacks side by side elsewhere. That was the main reason I returned this unit to the store."
1,Polaroid DVD Players are awful and the service is worse,"After purchasing a Polaroid PDV-0800 and using it for 4 months, the screen went out. I called Petters service on the phone and they agreed to service it or replace it. I was sent back a different unit 4 weeks later that had a cracked case right out of the box. I then called them back to get another one, and after many phones over the next 8 weeks trying to get them to send me a shipping label, I shipped it back to them myself. To my amazement, I was shipped back a PDV-0700 instead of a PDV-0800. I'm shocked that these idiots are still in business. I'm hoping if I raise enough of a stink with them, I can get a refund for the original purchase. What a waste.Update (Sept 15th): After numerous additional calls, I still haven't been able to get a replacement for the erroneous PDV-0700 that they shipped me. Why are they even bothering to make additional models? Just do us all a favor and give up the electronics business."
1,Product gone Bad,"I purchased this item 8 months ago for the purpose of using it while taking an extended train trip for Thanksgiving Holiday). I have used the product approximately five times since I bought it. I had experienced sensitive loading with the somewhat fragile lid on each use. While the quality of picture and sound was good, the unit no longer functions. This DVD player was handled and operated by just me (no children), never dropped and treated like all electronics should be, with upmost care. It worked on the last occassion and did not work the next. I did not purchase the extended warranty, Best Buy will not stand behind the purchase and judging by the comments on this site, its a waste of time to take the issue any further. I just wasted nearly $200 on a product that should not be on the market. My recommendation is to avoid both the product and the store, there are far too many other options. I only wish that the postings you see now were there prior to my purchase."
1,Very Poor Product - Even Worse Support!,"I had the screen go out on the DVD player. Customer Service offered to replace the unit provided I pay for an ""out of warranty"" exchange, which I did. I had the second unit for 5 months when the screen died again. They wanted me to purchase a third player!Needless to say, this is an extremely poor product and Polaroid does not stand behind it. I would not recommend purchasing this DVD player, and I would think twice about purchasing any Polaroid products because of the shoddy customer service.Polaroid customer service reps claim that under 2% of their players have problems. So maybe I'm just in that 0.04% of unlucky people that have had two break!"
1,Just Awful,"I went to Best Buy intending to buy a more expensive Toshiba portable DVD player. The associate convinced me to buy this Polaroid piece of junk. Bad choice. It looks great and works great at first. Give it a month or 2. I have returned 3 (!) of these things back to Polaroid because they break easily. I don't even take it anywhere on the road. It sits on a shelf in my room and still manages to break. Total piece of trash. Please do yourself a favor and buy a different brand, even if that means spending a few more bucks. It will be worth it. I guess Polaroid can't figure out moving pictures."
1,Inexpensive and built that way,"This was a good machine while it lasted. Unfortunately, it didn't last long. It took about four months of sporadic use before the DVD screen stopped working. One might want to consider another machine that is a little more durable."
1,Can I rate it 0 Stars?,"Yeah. The 0700. Watched one movie and then 20 minutes into the second movie, the sound died. Never able to get answers from the company. Look for this hot ticket on an internet auction with a strong *warning* on it."
1,Awful grainy picture - DO NOT BUY,"The Polaroid PVD-0700 is awful! The picture quality is worse than my $89 15-inch TV - very grainy. I was surprised to see the poor picture quality on the floor model. I assumed there was a problem with the demo. I purchased it despite the in-store poor quality because of the good reviews. My husband and I both thought the picture quality was abominable and I returned it the same day. I re-visited Circuit City and purchased an AMW model: M270 which I had seen before my unfortunate Polaroid purchase. The cost $199 regular price. Pros: picture quality is very clear, slimmer than the Polaroid, has remote, sound is clear and loud with headphones. Cons: sound is low but clear without headphones, does not come with car adapter or headphones. I've never heard of this brand, but the performance is great."
2,Returned because of poor quality,After only one week we had problems getting the unit to play both cds and dvds so I returned.
5,Relief,"I purchase our Panasonic 7&quot; DVD player 2 days before going to San Diego with my 2 kids ages 10 and 3. Even though the plane had a movie for the kids to watch, they were not big enough to see over the seat in front of them. They bought their own DVD to watch and it kept them entertained for the 2 hour delay. By that time, we had a lay over and had to stop for @ an hour. During that time, I charged the battery pack and we were on our way for another 3 hour flight. The quality was GREAT! The only problem was that the volume doesn't go up that loud. The kids had ear phones on which was a help. I would recommend this product to anyone that travels by plane, air, etc."
3,three hand portable dvd,"The is a good little unit if you have three hands, two to do normal everyday things and one to keep the cover down on the disc, this is what I have to do with mine to get it to play, or tape the cover down, the clasp won't keep it tight enough. Also, attaching the battery is a bit tricky, and the sound is not very good, even with headphones, but the picture is good. It should also be able to charge the battery while removed from the unit and it should also be able to charge from the dc cigarette lighter adaptor."
1,Nice product for the first 2 months until it broke,"I bought two players at Best Buy for an excellent price. Both worked well and were easy to operate. However, both units stopped functioning within 10-20 hours of total playing time over 8-10 weeks. I have sent both back for repairs under warranty but am not optimistic about their prospects for longevity, given the large number of people who have written in with complaints. The warranty only lasts for 90 days. Be sure to keep your receipt to obtain service under the warranty. I would not buy this product again and am very disappointed that trusty Polaroid would besmirch its good name with this poor quality product.I'm back now, a year later, and one of the two replacements broke again--disc doesn't spin. What a loser of a product!And now back months later that the second replacement broke."
1,BROKE AFTER 2 MONTHS,Even after being careful with this DVD player it stopped working after only a few months. It started with the cigarette adapter going then the unit itself would smell funny and over heat! It finally stopped working all together.Haven't heard back from the warranty department yet.
3,still a good value...not!,"I've had this unit for almost a year and it still works good, except that the lid won't stay shut. I just use a little bit of tape to hold it down.For the price, I think it is a good value nonetheless.----that was my old review. Just the other day, the left hinge broke like what happened to others. The player still works, although it can't be closed properly and I can no longer adjust the screen to a good viewing angle--it has to be open fully, plus I have to be careful or it will slam shut. So I'm lowering my rating to 2 stars."
1,2 Lemons...trying to get refund,"At first glance, this product looks like a deal with all you get with it. Buuuut, the fit and finish are not very good; parts began falling off and then one day the player just died. I called customer service and was told to send it back for repair. They sent me a brand new player within two weeks , which was great but then we took a flight to Grandma's with a very unhappy 16 month old. When we were finally allowed to use electronic devices, I tried to turn it on and it wouldn't play!!!!! Just like the first one!!! I've called customer service twice about a refund ( Best Buy wouldn't give me one the first time ). The first time they said someone would call within 48 hours...I called back a week later...still no call back. If I ever get my money back I'm going to buy a better name in electronics."
1,Broke after just a few months,"This player stopped reading discs after just a few months. I thought it was just a bad disc, and we don't use portable players often (just for long trips) so i didn't do anything about it, but it's definitely broken and I am having a hard time getting it repaired. For the price I paid I averaged about $25 for each movie we watched on it before it failed."
2,"Pay your money, take your chances","As the other reviewers note, when it works, it's a pretty good player. But, the odds that you get one that works over the long haul is probably 50-50. We've been through two in less than 2 years. First one had the power supply connector go bad. The second one loss the picture. Not about to buy another one."
1,"Poor Quality Item, terrible warranty","I have had 2 of these DVD players and both of them had significant problems. The first DVD player began malfunctioning in under a year. When I called the company, I was told that the full warranty lasted for only 3 months and that I would have to pay a $50 labor charge to get the player repaired or replaced. After paying the $50 for another player, the second completely stopped functioning after 4 months. Of course, I would have to pay another $50 to replace this one. I will be researching other DVD players and will never purchase from Polaroid again!"
2,Quit playing after one week,The unit quit playing after one week and was returned to Best Buy. Low quality and decided to get a refund rather than exchange for a new one.
1,unethical seller,"This portable DVD player does not work at all, completely dead, but the seller would not respond to our requests for a refund. This is not a trustworthy seller."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE,"We bought this dvd player in May of 2004, used it 4 or 5 times. The sound is very low in the car so you must buy the ear phones. We pulled it out recently for a trip and the left hinge just broke! We were very careful with this item and yet it broke and is out of warranty. Save your money and don't buy Polaroid DVD players."
2,Great little player --then it just dies,"I got this little player, and was satisfied with the picture and all the wonderful accessories bundled with the unit. I used it on trips and at home on a daily basis with NO problems for 8 months. Then one day, without warning, it died. I get the little ""NO DISC"" error. From what I understand, the laser needs to be realigned, but since the warranty is 90 days, you'll have to pay for that, and it can cost $95.00. I've seen some reviews of purchasers who have had no problems after a year or two, and some who have issues after 1-2 uses. If you do buy this, purchase an extended warranty, which is cheaper than replacing the player, which I ended up doing."
4,"Response to : Dumbfounded consumer (Baton Rouge, LA USA)","The problem with the product is the manual. Not a good help at all.But I did find a solution for the black and white problem (loose color).On the side of the player there is a ""AV"" switch"". With the player on, I turned the AV switch to IN than back to OUT, then I put an DVD and it went back to color. (I was trying different things a few days ago - including the AV switch - and it probably that caused the dvd player to go black and white).Good luck!"
1,Broken after 10 months,"Just dusted off my player, after having it work hit or miss over the last few months. Frankly, I thought it was me during those periods. Well, it's not me. It's broken. And, after reading the reviews, I wished I'd seen them before buying mine last year. Found my receipt and hoping they'll honor the warranty. Buy another brand. Clearly, this is not an unusual experience."
3,Substandard Polaroid Product.,"I have the polaroid portable DVD player and so far I am not impressed with it. For starters the lid to the DVD player pops open at the slightest nudge or movement. There is only one headphone port and the volume is lousy at best. I forgot my headphones on a recent flight and so I had to play it as is and I couldn't here is over the standard airplane backround noise. The screen and resolution is good but I'd say all in all they need to work out the kinks in this particular model. I wish I could take this back for a different model. Also the battery is so sensitive and fragile, atleast that's how the book makes it out to be so you don't even want to touch it if at all possible. Every time I remove the battery I feel like I have to force it and am afraid that I'll break it. All in all it gets the job done but for the money I paid I feel I should have gotten a better product."
2,It's nice until it breaks..and it will break.,"Like some earlier positive reviews, I like the performance of this player when it's new and working. But the construction of this thing is barely acceptable. In my case, the left hinge ""exploded"" while closing the screen - it snapped apart and a small screw fell out. I am very careful and cautious with my stuff and this unit was not stressed in any way.I sent the unit back under warranty (5 months old - maybe 10 uses) and WaCA/Petters did eventually send a new unit, but it took 2 months and 3 phone calls. I have no expectation of long-term satisfaction from the new player.Overall this has been a learning experience. No more disposable Polaroid electronics for me. You are advised to look elsewhere."
1,DO NOT BUY POLAROID,"I purchased this portable DVD player for our RV. We went on 2 trips and played a total of 10 movies when it no longer would work. The screen turned completely white. The DVD player was 94 days old after we returned from our 2nd trip. 4 days out of warranty - Polaroid said it was not fixable and the best they would offer is a replacement unit - for $50.00! It's only an $80 DVD player, why would I pay $50.00 when the 1st one only lasted 10 DVD's. Very unhappy with Polaroid, will never buy another one of their products!!!!!!!!!"
1,broke in 7 months,"I also bought this for use in the car. It worked well for 7 months. Now it will not read or play discs of any kind. A call to customer service results in nothing! I'm told these units are ""non-repairable"" and with a warranty of only 3 months ... who can afford this?Don't buy it!"
4,Good value for the money,"The Polaroid PDV-0700 is a good value for the price. I bought it for my young kids to watch their movies and cartoons in the car during long trips, so for that purpose it is fine. The picture is not the sharpest and the colors are not the most precise, but my girls aren't too concerned with that. The audio from the unit's built-in speakers is tinny and bassless, as can be expected from such tiny speakers, but if you buy a cassette adapter and play it through the car stereo it sounds great. It performs well and can handle the most common disc formats, including playback of discs full of JPEG pictures, which is useful as an electronic photo album when you go to visit family and friends. We got it for under $200, which is less than we paid for the bulky 9"" TV/VCR combo we used in the car before this."
1,This product is a dog....,"We don't use our product very often so our warrany is long expired. After about the fifth use, the screw holding the screen to the unit came loose and the screen fell off and broke. Save your money and buy something else."
2,Not too impressed,"I was so excited when I won this dvd player in a raffle. I opened the box and within a matter of minutes I was playing the dvd, it was very simple to operate. However, The thing that annoys me about this machine is that the door is very sensitive and the dvd player will reset if you bump or move it while the dvd is playing. I haven't put a whole lot of hours on it so far, so I can't speak to the longivity but I also can't be too critical because after all it was free. Now, would I buy this make and model? Can't say, but I would definitly go and see and play several others before making that decision."
4,Everything great but the price,"I needed these boards to separate some computers in a lab that I run. These seemed like the cheapest solution to do the trick, save cutting up several boxes myself (although that would have looked far from uniform or professional). The box that it was shipped in was far too big for the contents. It comes in its own box and I'm not really even sure why Amazon packaged it in twice that size so that it could shift around and potentially damage the corners. I ditched the bigger box.All in all, the product is exactly what I expected. I only wish, and this may be far-fetched, that it would have been more reasonably priced. For trifold sheets of cardboard, I would have expected to pay less than about $3 per board But, it's the best price out there based upon my comparison shopping, so what can you do?"
2,Neil Sedaka,This cd is not the original recorded hit songs. I was looking so hard at the price and shipping on a select group of his cd's that I didn't notice that they were re-recorded and not the original hits. Very disappointed..
