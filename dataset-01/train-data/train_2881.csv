1,Greatly disappointed,I had high hopes for this Seagate 300GB external drive. Had it for 4 days and it was working flawless. I ran across the Amazon reviews of the drive but had my hopes high. Then the write errors came as I knew they would in the back of my mind. The second time it froze my system was enough for me. I returned it for a refund after 5 days and will wait for Seagate to solve the problems.
1,"Failed, However...","I purchased this drive in March of 2005. It just failed as the above users drives failed (March 2006). However, this has a happy ending and my fingers are still crossed. It was still under warrenty so i went to the Seagate site and to my amazement I was able to pay 24.95USD and they preshipped me a replacement in two days with a Call tag. I was able to salvage my old files and slowly copy them to the NEW 400 gig replacement! 100 extra gigs. Its a totally new model too. So I have my fingers crossed.. I am shipping the old one back today! YEAH!! So try this.. You can see if your drive is under warranty online at Seagate.com and start the RMA process right away. Good Luck.."
4,Works great,I bought this drive to use as additional AV Storage. It has been working great as offline storage for my ReplayTV unit and also is fast enough to serve up videos directly to ReplayTV. In addition I use it for digital photos and music and have not had any problems with it. I did reformat the drive to NTFS prior to transfering the data and I am using the USB2 connection instead of the firewire but I like the fact that is has both connections available. Overall a great product for an external drive. But like all external drives data transfer speed is limited by the USB2 or firewire interface speed.
1,Failed after 6 months,"Not very happy that the drive failed, especially after treating it with kid's gloves. All I can say is that it is a good job I didn't rely on this as my sole method of backing up valuable data. I won't buy Seagate products again."
2,Works okay but I don't trust it...,"This my second unit - the first was replaced by Seagate after it died 18 months ago. This one has worked fairly well; I use it to store my Ipod music and videos but for it to work properly I have to boot my PC first then the drive then use Itunes or whatever. Before I learned this lesson, I had to reformat the drive to get it to be recognized. ouch! While my data appeared to be lost, I luckily used a recovery utility (""recover my Files"") to reclaim everything off the drive but it is an exercise I do not want to repeat. It's acting up again today so here I am browsing Amazon. I've used a Western Digital My Book at work and that has been reliable so I am going to switch to that."
1,Good Buy = good bye,"The drive ran fine for 6 months, then failed without warning. A disaster!Do not buy this drive!"
2,This one is buggy,"I bought two of these. The first one overheated and failed within two months. Seagate replaced it with the 400 GB model that has been working fine. It looks like the second one is now running hot and doomed to fail, the only good thing is that it is under the year warranty.If you do buy these, then remember to DVD backup, else when the drive overheats, nothing will get your data back.----Addendum. Well, I've had two of these for two years now, and no additional failures. I leave them on all day long, and the read-write is fast and works with my computer.I use one for photo/video backups and the other as a straight backup.So far, these have been the best performers of all the external HD's I have purchased."
1,Made grinding/clicking noises after two weeks of usage.,"I just purchased this item a few weeks ago after reading that the firmware was updated & the model number changed, but I still found problems.After using it for about two weeks without any problems, I suddenly began hearing clicking noises and grinding when the drive was running and reading/writing data. I didnt experience any data loss, or errors, but the noises led me to believe that data loss/errors would begin occuring soon after.I returned it and purchased the Maxtor OneTouch II which received great reviews."
1,"Shuts down after a few minutes - zero stars, really",The drive seems to be working fine and then you hear a fairly loud <clunk> like the heads banging against their parking spot. The drive is now dead until you power-cycle it. Any reads or writes in progress are obviously lost. This is completely unacceptable.
3,Bad out of the box but good RMA service...,"Before the box was open I heard a rattle. Upon opening the sealed box I found that the rattle was a 3/4"" screw loose inside the drive case. So back into the bag without so much as an attempt at using it.Since I'm in New Zealand, processing the RMA means spending $70 to ship it to Singapore. Happily they've put a 400GB drive in the mail to replace the 300GB one I sent them, so aside from the lost couple of weeks, I'm about even.Otherwise I'd consider $70 a high price to pay for someone's carelessness at the factory.We'll see what happens when I actually get to try the drive out! It sounds like about 50% odds on having to shell out another 70 clams... Fingers crossed."
1,Product is a waste - does not work,"I bought the 400 GB drive, and like others here, the drive simply doesn't work. It runs fine for a period of time and then disconnects. Complete waste of money. Seagate's customer service has been very cavalier about the problem suggesting it is my system - but clearly from searching the web, the problem is in the hardware. Avoid this product!!!!"
1,don't waste your money,"I bought this unit on January 15, 2005. Exactly a month later, my pc can no longer detect the external HD.Pro: price/size, noise levelCon: stopped to work after 1 month"
1,Piece of Junk,"Pulled it out of the box, plugged it in and immediately got a delayed write error and then an I/O error.Tried to reformat it to see if that helped and it promptly failed."
1,I would not buy this drive again,"I purchased a Seagate 300 GB external hard drive in Jan 2005 and it failed today (18 Dec 2005). My PC does not even recognize it and tech support walk-thru indicates the drive has failed. Seagate has a data recovery service for a fee- isn't this ludicrous- they sell you a drive that fails then offer to get your data back for a fee?! The warranty will allow them to send me a blank replacement, but my data is gone (fortunately I still have most of it on my internal hard drive). The replacement is only good for the the remainder of my warranty - 1 month! I would not trust the replacement anyways, based on this experience. I WOULD NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN!"
1,Don't Buy This Drive,"See my review of the ""Seagate 400 GB External USB 2.0/FireWire Hard Drive with Backup"" for my bad experience with the 300 and 400GB version of this drive."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"After several months, my hard drive crashed and won't power up. After searching online, I found that this has happened to a lot of people with this drive. Seagate will replace the drive under warranty, but will charge at least $700 (upwards of serveral thousand)to recover any data. Even before it crashed it was buggy- randomly disconnecting from the computer and many write errors. My advice is to buy a different hard drive."
1,Piece O Junk,"Have gone through two of these bricks. First one crapped out after about a month with errors. Second has just died. Won't even get recognized by computer and won't turn off. Seagate will replace but return shipping is on your dime. So, I will have had to pay an extra $20+ to get a third piece of junk cinder block."
1,DON'T BUY THIS GRINDER - IT'S A PIECE IF JUNK,"What a major disappointment and waste of time, money and beans. It clogs and it spews grounds. Trying to unclog it (if you're successful) will get grounds all over the place. This is the third one that took a dump on us and I'm sick of going back to the store. Wish I could just get my money back. It works fairly well if you don't put flavored coffee beans in it but a guest thought they would surprise us with some flavored coffee and now the machine is kaput. I had an old antique one that worked beautifully for years but gave it to my brother after a move and thought I'd treat myself to a nice new shiny model. What a mistake. The old original 50 year old machine worked fine. Wonder what Kitchen Aid is paying the genius who redesigned this? I know I'll think twice before I purchase ANY Kitchen Aid product again."
1,the negative reviews were 100% correct,"This is a poorly desgined grinder. Maybe OK for the occasional user, as it requires serious cleaning of the spout and counter after each use. Not a reliable machine for the daily or serious coffee drinker. Am returning it."
2,KitchenAid Burr Mill Grinder,"The grinder is great. The only part I do not particularly care for are the grind settings. It is hard to turn to the proper setting- you have to turn the dial a certain way at the beginning, when you miss your setting, you have to turn the dial the opposite way, you simply can not turn it backwards. You also have to put in some elbow grease when you turn the dial. Other than that it is a nice grinder."
1,Bad News Coffee Grinder,"Purchased this grinder new and did not use it during hot summer months. Grinder quit working after using it sporadically for just over one year. Consequently, the warranty had expired. Thankfully, I didn't toss my cheapo burr grinder that is still going strong. I wouldn't waste my money on another one."
1,Broke during the 2nd use.,"I ordered this product on the internet with excitement and bought 2 lbs. of coffee prior to receiving it. Once I got the KitchenAid coffee mill, the assembly and instructions were simple and I then grinded my first batch of cinnamon hazelnut beans on the medium setting and it turned out well. On second use, the motor immediately sounded like it was struggling (it did not have the sound of robustness as when I first used it). The motor then stoped working and it let out a continuous billow of smoke. It never worked again. I am very disappointed in paying $130 for it and then contacting KitchenAid Corp. only to receive an unsupportive response. I am currently attempting to contact the internet vendor regarding the return of the product."
2,A messy little coffee mill,"Like many products there is some good and some bad. THE GOOD IS: 1 - The unit looks good. 2 - The mill's adjustment from an expresso fine to a french press course works very well with a good consistant grind at both ends of the spectrum. 3 - Unlike plastic units I've owned before, there was little static cling on the side of the glass cup. THE BAD IS: I used the unit 4 times before returning it to Williams-Sonoma where I purchased it. Each time there was a good sized mess to clean up on the counter and the base of the mill itself. The second time I used it, the mill actually spit out grounds about 20"", over the top of the glass cup and onto the floor. Out came the vacuum cleaner. I've been grinding coffee beans for several years and no other grinder I've owned has been this messy. I forked over an additional $70 to buy the KitchenAid Professional model Williams-Sonoma also sells. This one works very well without the mess."
2,Beautiful but very flawed.,"Yes it looks great and is built to last, sort of. There is a flaw in the pin that holds the bottom burr on to the motor shaft. I have broken the small shear pin 4 times. How you ask? When I switch from my regular drip beans, to espresso beans. I dump the regular beans, twist the ring to a fine setting, put in the espresso beans and turn it on. The grinds come out course. The bottom burr has sheared it's pin and dropped down, eventually the motor just spins. There really should be a recall. With a few changes this could be a fantastic grinder, but with the mess and shear pin problems it's just not there yet. I am going to try and return the grinder."
2,Rice is the answer!,"I am on the THIRD Model A-9 burr coffee grinder in the last 16 months. I replaced the original almost one year to the day. Customer Service promptly replaced it; it stopped working in 3.5 months. On the phone again with customer service and she asked me if I used flavored coffees, I told her ""no"", she then asked if I used French Roast or Espresso... and I told her, ""yes"" I did. She asked me if the rep I spoke with last time told me about running a cup of rice through the unit after grinding oily coffees, such as French Roast, et al: no, they hadn't. She explained that ""grinding"" rice through the mill occasionally will absorb the oils from dark roasts. So, I now have a box of rice next to my coffee grinder that I will use to grind after every 1-pound of beans. I'm not happy about it, but until I find a reliable, non-spewing-mess-making burr grinder, I guess it will have to do."
2,Messy and clogs frequently,"I had high hopes for this sexy machine, but the tiny opening clogs easily (the smallest of any coffee mill I've seen), is difficult to clean (the brush they give you wont fit inside) and it leaves grounds all over your countertop. As an engineer, it seems that the deficiencies should be easy to fix with some minor design changes. I dont know how this unit got past usability testing.I am now using another grinder while this machine decorates my countertop on the other sideof the kitchen. It's a lot of money for a useless countertop ornament. Sure looks pretty, though."
3,KitchenAid fan,"After two years of good use the motor wore out :-( So sad because my family loved how this grinder performed. I would expect a KitchenAid motor to last much longer, so this problem accounts for my rating of 3 instead of 5. I've stepped up to the KitchenAid Pro as a replacement since its even easier to use.I had absolutely no problem with clogging and I grind on the finest setting using Starbucks coffee beans. When using the equipment properly, only small amounts of grind ever escaped - far less than other brands I've owned. I haven't experienced any ""cloudiness"" or ""moisture"" build up in the bean jar either. I really liked this grinder but I now think it is overpriced (lasted only 2 years! and oily or flavor-coated beans are not recommended - a gottcha for all us Starbucks consumers)."
2,"Great looking, Poor performing","We had this grinder for about 6 months before it started to show it's flaws. It grinds wonderfully and has several settings from super espresso fine to coarse. Problem is, the grinds get stuck in there somehow and jam the wheel that you turn to select the settings. Basically, it will only grind 3 or so different ones for us now. We just keep it on medium all the time. I love the look of it- kind of retro- but if I had it to do over again, I would buy a better quality... Kind of surprising too since KitchenAid is such a reputable brand."
4,So far ... so good,"After reading all the negative reviews, I was a bit concerned but took the plunge anyway. It looks great (if you are into the retro style) and feels very solid. I really don't understand why people keep having coffe grounds spill all over the place. Although I haven't used it all that much (3-4 times per week for 2 months), I have never had a problem grinding. Just turn it on and the grounds fall into the little glass cup with minimal mess.It's probably not the most efficient contraption, but it looks very cool and gets the job done."
4,Works much better if you read the instructions...,"At first I had to agree with many of the other reviewers -- this thing made a MESS. However, I trust KitchenAid enough to realize that they never could have released a product quite this bad. So, I went back to the manual and found out you are supposed to leave the spout lid closed while grinding -- and OH, what a difference it makes... Also, it explains that it is easier to change settings when the grinder is operating.Although it is noisy, it is much quietier than my Braun Burr grinder and my little Braun blade grinder. The coffee is of uniform consistency and it has a large storage capacity for the whole beans. I wish there was some sort of storage for ground beans other than the measuring cup.It also does dress up the kitchen counter quite a bit. Is it worth the price -- I don't know? My $15.00 Braun still does a pretty decent job."
3,Flying coffee grounds!,"This coffee mill is badly designed. It grinds the coffee, but it throws grounds everywhere! Most of the grounds go into the glass hopper, but I end up with some grounds on the counter, some still in the spout, and even some on the kitchen floor. I am surprised that KitchenAid did not design this better. I like their products in general but may decide to return this one and keep searching for a good grinder."
1,Big Problem to Clean,"This product worked great for about two weeks. Super Coffe with very little mess. Then, the coffee began to spit and burst all over the counter, the floor and me! I keep cleaning, looking for lodged beans in the mechanics. This is quite inconvenient and no matter how well I clean, how careful I am to make sure the spout stays down, I have a mess. Today, I will return it to the store."
2,"Looks nice, sounds loud, makes mess","I'm not a coffee conossieur by any means, and I ordered this coffee mill from KitchenAid as part of a recall.On the pro side, the unit does have a variety of settings, looks nice, and can hold a good amount of beans.On the not-so-pro side, it is loud enough to wake the dead, it occassionally stalls/gets stuck, and it consistently makes a mess on the counter. I've tried several ways to minimize the mess, and have failed."
2,"Not terribly good, especially given the price","Grinds well enough, but we are returning ours because the beans don't fall into the burrs very well, and no actual grinding takes place. I find that I have to open the jar on top of the grinder, and push the beans down so that they actually go into the grinding burrs. Tried three different types of (non-flavored) coffee. Between this and the scattering of the coffee grinds, this machine just doesn't cut it. Too much hassle."
1,"Good grind, but messy, messy, messy!","I bought two of these units for Christmas gifts. The motor on the first one seized up after the second use and the grinder had to be returned directly to Kitchen Aid (which had good customer service and replaced it without issue). The second gift went to my Mother, who was replacing one she's had since the late 70's. She too returned it, but not for the same reason. After a few uses, she just got tired of losing coffee grinds to the countertop. The flap was down while in use, but the coffee would still come out the sides and top and go everywhere. The old model had an eliptical cup that caught just about everything. This one just makes a mess. The grind was good, but we'll be buying something else."
3,At least they have a good warranty,"I have had some bad luck with coffee grinders, so I decided to go with Kitchen aid because of the hassle free warranty and Kitchen aid's reputation. I purchased the grinder in November. My original grinder malfunctioned after 2 months. A hassle free replacement was sent, but this one has the same issue after a month of use - a head pin (internally) that has sheared off. The good news is that Kitchen Aid is going to send me an upgraded grinder, as this one is no longer available. In the end, it seems I will be getting a better coffee grinder than the one that I originally paid for. Even though 2 have broken, I rate this product 3 stars because Kitchen sid just keeps sending out replacement ones until they get it right."
1,Kitchen Aid Embarassment,"I was attracted to the retro styling of this grinder and the cache of its brand. What a disappointment. I should have believed the customer review regarding its deficiencies. It is a good looking retro machine. It fails miserably as a coffee grinder. It has a great deal of unproductive grinding. I do not use anything other than plain whole beans. The machine persistently ""jams"" and then goes into a whining unproductive high speed rev of the motor. When it does work (after partial disassemby and removal of impacted grounds)it is VERY messy withgrounds all over the countertop. It looks good but should be an embarassment to Kitchen Aid. I shall write their management with my comments. DO NOT PURCHASE...DON'T even take for free."
1,packed grounds & sheared pins,"We bought our grinder with our wedding gift certificates. About every month the grounds get jam packed between the blades and flapper door, and has to be COMPLETELY taken apart and THOROUGHLY cleaned. On one such jamming the motor blew and we had it replaced. Now, same problem except after moving a state away from the chain of stores, the pin beneath the blade sheared. I replaced the pin with a high carbon steel pop rivet segment and it lasted a year, but the monthly anti-jamming rituals continue. My 1903 Arcade glass hopper grinder is my backup grinder which never jams or breaks. Perhaps Kitchen Aid should study 100 year old technology and fire the engineers that designed this flop!"
1,I wouldn't give this to my EX wife,"I got a brand new one that I'm afraid to start. I sent one back that kept clogging. Kitchen Aid said I was using the wrong beans. You are suppose to use the non flavored beans, since the flavor beans have oil on them, which would make the grinder clog. BUT I even had non flavor beans that would clog the grinder. Are you suppose to open the bag of coffee before you buy them? Kitchen Aid also told me to run some rice thru the grinder. (To clean it) So step 1 grind some beans, step 2 take out all the beans that U didn't grind, (did U see the picture of the grinder? Looks great with all the beans in the jar) Step 3 Run some rice thru the grinder. Step 4 put the whole beans back in the jar.... I DON'T THINK SO.I have a Kitchen Aid mixer which I love. With a name like Kitchen Aid all there stuff should be 5 stars."
1,Unreliable and poorly designed,"The nice feature of the design is that there is a sealed jar that holds the coffee beans. However, the spigot that is supposed to direct the ground coffee into a measuring cup allows the grinds to be sprayed on the countertop as well. It is extremely noisy compared to simple spinning blade grinder. KitchenAid says in is not designed to mill flavored coffee. My unit failed completely after about three months. The motor spins but it doesn't mill anything. I tried cleaning it out, etc., but I cannot get it to work at all; I think the cutter is detached. KitchenAid supposedly has a one year guarantee, but is has proved difficult to get them to honor that. I could not find any info on the KitchenAid web site. I finally got a pointer by sending e-mail to them. They tried suggesting the failure was my fault, but provided a ""live chat"" interface. I cannot get the live chat to work on my computer, so I sent them another e-mail, which they have thus far ignored."
3,"OK, but noisy and sometimes messy","Looks great, seems to grind up the beans just fine, but it is noisy and it does sporadically decide to spew coffee grinds out of its spout all over the counter instead of into the glass cup. This seems to happen mainly when the hopper is getting low on beans, but sometimes just does it anyway."
4,"Good grinder, excellent customer service","I love this coffee grinder DESPITE having it break in the first month. It has a wonderfully consistent grind and, while there is some coffee around the base after grinding, the round particles (rather than the dust many grinders create) are easy to clean up.The down side is that it died in the first month. The drive pin seems to be a weak link. I called Kitchenaid and talked with someone in the southern US who couldn't have been more pleasant. They shipped a replacement to me immediately, which has a full one-year guarantee on it.I hope that it doesn't break again, but if it does, I know the replacement will be there in a few days. I don't often settle for this level of uncertainty with products, but this is the exception: The performance is so good that I'm willing to risk the inconvenience!"
1,Just the worst - coffee lovers beware!,"I was thoroughly disappointed that any KitchenAid product could be so awful. I have had large and small KitchenAid appliances over the years and been delighted with them. This is a LEMON! The only thing nice I can say about it is the retro styling. If I wanted to have coffee grounds all over my sink, counter and kitchen floor, I could buy a bag and spread them around myself. Not only is this inordinately messy, the beans do not feed well from the hopper, do not all grind, and fly around instead of pouring exclusively into the glass container. What a disaster. I don't care if burr grinders are supposed to be ""so good"" - I will keep my cheap blade grinder any day!"
1,BUYER BEWARE,"Well, I thought by buying Kitchen Aid, I would be getting something great. I was judging the product by my past experience with the brand. Well, the first 30 days were great. It worked perfect,although it does get the counter a little messy with grounds,I was ok with that. On the 31st day, it did not work anymore.Have tried to get it to work, but it's done working. Oh well,back to having the coffee shop grind my beans for me."
3,"grinds great, makes a mess !","the engineers should have made the outlet longer and tilted downward.... although it grinds great, ground coffee gets out around opening and you need to clead up excess each time !!! shame on them engeneering bastards !!!"
2,Messy,"So I read the reviews that complained about this machine throwing ground coffee all over the place. But I also saw that people said the opposite. So...I figured it must be operator error.Wrong. I think I tried everything but couldn't get it to stop spewing coffee from around the metal flap. It goes everywhere.Other than that, it's a great grinder."
1,Bad design and defective,"It worked for only 5 times. The design flaw is the output of the coffee. It hits the flap then falls into the glass cup. if the coffee sticks to the flap or the force changes, the coffee is everywhere. Even when it works right there is still a little to clean up around the grinder. On the fifth use it seized up and there was no good way of fixing it. It was returned. They make a better one for about 100 to 150 dollars more."
1,Messy!,I hate this machine and can't believe it cost a hundred bucks. They should pay me for using it. It sprays grounds all over everything. It clogs up after each and every use. This is the worst thing Kitchen-Aid has ever made. Do not waste your money. I was and am much happier with my twenty dollar Cuisanart blade grinder.
2,Worked fine for 2 days,"The A-9 worked great for 2 days after I bought it, then made some weird noises, emitted some acrid smoke, and stopped working. I took it back for a refund. This is the 3rd of 5 kitchen aid products I've bought in the past 2 years that didn't work or had quality control or mechanical ""issues"".Oh, as for the A-9, while it worked: The graduations in grinding size are neat, except 99% of all Americans will only ever use ""fine."" Within a few hours of loading the jar with beans, the inside of the glass will develop a smoky film due to the oils evaporating from the beans. Kinda didn't expect that.Heck, that might have been the motor burning..."
1,Don't Buy It!!!!,"I purchased my first one, which broke within two months (the grinder just quit). Kitchenaid replaced it promptly,& in 2 months this one began spewing grinds all over everywhere. It was returned and replaced with another one. In 2 months, this one has done the same thing!! I am about to return this one as well. Each time I return one of them, I ask what kind of coffee I could expect to grind successfully. Always they said, don't use a flavored coffee. So, I used the Eight O'clock Coffee which they suggested last time. I haven't even finished my first pound of coffee beans, and it broke.Kitchenaid would like to talk me into upgrading to their pro-line, but its about $100 more and I have lost faith in Kitchenaid. Each one they send, however, says the warranty begins when I receive it. At this rate, I'll be receiving about 6 each year. Maybe they will get tired of me and refund my money.I can only hope."
1,Throws coffee everywhere,The title says it all. As others have reported when grinding coffee it sprays all over the place. For the price of this machine you would think they would have taken care of this problem. I can't afford to throw it away and but another so I do a lot of clean up.
3,Already shot coffee all over the counter,It works but sometimes it decides to shoot coffee all over the counter...maybe something gets stuck or Something....But it looks cool sitting on my counter...and does the job 85% of the time.... UPDATE...IT BROKE...Does not work at all now!!
2,Beautiful - but not worth it,I bought my first one about 14 months ago - it lasted about 8 months. Motor made a high pitched sound and blew coffee all over. I dismantled the whole unit - it then worked for about 2 days. I called Kitchenaid - (they are right about no hassle warranty) They quickly sent me out a new one. This new one lasted about 6 months - and now has the same symptoms. I really wish this was the grinder for me - I LOVE the Capacity for bean storage and LOVE the way it looks - I have been forced to look at other grinders.Hope this helps. By the way - I used grinders twice daily - in the morn and then in the evening - not like I was putting a whole lot of strain on them!Hope this helps
2,"Fine, but not fine enough","This grinder no doubt scores high on style with its retro-look and choice of color, but it still does not satisfy all of my requirements. The ""fine"" grind setting is just not fine enough for espresso. It is difficult to justify spending so much for a grinder that does not grind well enough for all styles of coffee. Also, when moving the grind setting wheel, my grinder gets stuck. Even after I have emptied the hopper and struggled moving the wheel back and forth, I cannot move the wheel throughout all of its settings. Reading the reviews, I now find that others have had similar problems.When I go for a medium grind for drip or for a coarse setting for french press, the grinder performs admiarably. It quickly provides a consistent grind. Unfortunately, the product does not perform quite as well as expected."
1,3 replacements,"Let me start by saying I have many KitchenAid products and have never had a problem with any before the coffee mill. I received this for a gift and in about 2 years I am on my 4th mill - the first lasted 1 year and it went downhill from there. While they have been friendly and replaced them because of the motor stopping or a pin breaking twice, I don't think I should have to deal with this. They said if it breaks again they are going to either return the money or I will have to buy the upgraded model for an additional 100.00! (BECAUSE THEY TOLD ME THIS IS NOT A COMMON PROBLEM!) I just hope this one holds up (I'm not sure why. I'd probably be better off with the money, but I really do like it when it works!)"
1,Nice Try Guys,"I own several KitchenAid Items including the Heavy Duty electric mixer, blender, hand mixer processor. Should I go on? This coffee grinder needs some help. My friend just bought one and it does the same thing. It spits grounds from California to Cape Cod when it's running. Can't figure out why and the problem is intermittent. I'm betting a lot of these are being returned. Outside of that, KitchenAid makes some outstanding products."
1,NOT a reliable Coffee Mill!!!!,"DON'T BE FOOLED...even though these LOOK like the original Kitchen-aid models, they are NOT of the same quality. Mine died a year after purchase; however my vintage '50s model is still going strong. Don't waste your money on these overpriced knock-offs. Buy the vintage model on eBay or elsewhere. Not only is it cheaper, but it is mechanically MUCH MORE RELIABLE."
4,"Heavy duty grinder with an old look, works great.",I bought my wife the red A-9 Coffee Mill for her last Christmas to go with her red Kitchenaid Coffee Maker. She loves it. She grinds 4 cups worth at a time and it's fast and easy to measure out. We did have trouble with some of the fancy holiday flavored coffee clogging the mill when we had it set at the finest grind. The beans that caused the trouble seem to be coated with flavoring and stuck together after being ground. But it was easy to clean and we finished off the bag. Other than that it has worked perfect for over 9 months.
4,Just what I needed,This product is a must if you have to rebuild muscles due to injury or arthritis. I have this a must have after deciding to find other alternatives to costly physical therapy visits to use the same equipment!!!
4,Well worth another listen,"If ""78 in the Shade"" had been released by another band not called Small Faces, it may well have received glowing reviews. Fitting in nicely alongside Steve Marriott's ""Marriott"" solo album from 1976 and the work he went on to do when he was re-united with Ronnie Lane in The Legendary Majik Mijits, ""78"" is a smooth, soul-infused gem of a record with many stand-out tracks, none finer than ""Stand By Me (Stand By You)"" and ""Too Many Crossroads"". Marriott's voice is in fine form, the songs are equal parts rock/soul with some folk touches sprinkled throughout. Don't think too much about the mighty Small Faces 60's legacy and give this great record another spin."
3,78 is not 68,"78 is not Ogdens, but 78 is not 68 either.Marriott is 10 years older and is a different person, so of course, so is his music. He did NOT try to replicate the Small Faces of yesteryear at all, and that is hard for some to grasp.78 is a different creature and has some outstanding performances, Too Many Crossroads and Soldier Boy are as good as anything Marriott's ever done.If you like Marriott, you'll like 78. If you want happydaystoytown, you'll be disappointed."
2,Sophomore Effort Fails (A Review in 12 Words...or less),"No heart (Ronnie Lane), no soul (Rod Stewart), someone pull the plug."
1,toaster,"This toaster was not as I expected it - there was a small dent on one side, the handle was crooked and wiggly, and the toasting was uneven. Needless to say, it was returned."
2,"Barney, what happened?","My 2 year old grandson adores Barney, but this CD left him cold. He'll listen to it for a few minutes and then wants nothing to do with it. He sings his ABC songs all day and loves to count, so I thought this would be a big hit. He couldn't get enough of another Barney CD, so I'm disappointed that this one didn't work out."
5,"Excellent album, Jaye P. Morgan is at her peak.","Jaye P. Morgan's clean, crisp singing style is apparent and the sound is good on this album. Jaye P. sings with a style that shows much creativity as she uses subtle changes in each song. If she were around today, she could adapt her style and be comtempory in today's ballad music. She sings with much heart and sensitivity on the ballad songs and sings with a bright, fun heart on the more upbeat songs. They bring back the 50's with a bang. She was so popular for a few years and then disappeared. This album shows her very unique style and is a must for any Jaye P. Morgan fan. It's good to hear from her again."
5,Great music from an excellent song stylist!,"This compilation collects many of Jaye P.'s wonderful hit recordings from her RCA tenure, also included are some great LP cuts. Jaye P.'s voice is outstanding, she is a great vocal stylist! The quality of the CD is top notch! This is a welcome addition to anyones CD library."
5,Holley 570 CFM Carburetor,"Bought this for a 1973 Chevy Impala, had a few problems installing it, but that was because of user error and not any problem that the carburetor. If you have a traditional air intake on your car, you will need to upgrade to an open air intake system that has slots for the floats of the carburetor to fit into. other than that, this thing runs like a champ and actually gives me better performance than the old 760 CFM i had on it before. i would highly recommend this."
3,Important Reference Book,"I found this volume Three of Berman's Bronzes : Sculptors and Founders,1800-1930, like the volume Two, a very serious research of images, artists, etc., although I regret the absence of longer comments about the artists, like a biography, and about the best or the worst period of their works."
3,OK set.,This set of cutlery is pretty flimsy. They get bent out of shape when I try to crush tuna. They are worth the price but for five more dollars I bought an excellent stainless steal set on amazon.
3,"good movie, bad copy","I bought this dvd thinking it was a legitimate movie. It was copied off of the fox movie network. I don't know if this is legal or not, but how could it be? The movie was great. Good story and good dance numbers. Too bad it is not put out by the holders of the copyright."
1,Just Cannot Get This One Right!,"The first unit I ordered arrived with a dead battery. A complete replacement was sent; however, I just discovered this weekend that it is not measuring accurately. I have tried to tare (zero) the unit, etc. to no avail. One pound shows up as 9.9 ounces (280 grams). Although the weight is the same each time, it is still way off."
3,Not Impressed!,"Jed McKenna claims that he is the 'only' person to have discovered the spiritual meaning of Moby Dick. How obscurd!And Julia's spiritual rant that encompassed most of the book, was a bit over the top.This book starts out with Jed whining about how much he dislikes California, as he says, ""It's not really California, it's the people who live in California that he really hates.""There are some wonderful spiritual writings available, this is not one of them."
2,reader from florida,"While I do find the author's ramblings amusing, enlightened is not the word I would use to describe him. While it is true that many enlightened souls carry the world lightly and are not easily upset by what goes on around them, Mr. Mckenna simply doesn't give a damn, but still seems put off by just about everything and everyone. This appears to be not giving a damn posing as enlightenment -- not the same thing!"
5,Love this scale!,I ordered this scale to upgrade from one of the awful things you buy in the discount stores. I needed a scale to divide portions and cook for two people. This scale is small and easy to use. I love being able zero the scale to weigh items on a plate or in a bag which keeps the scale clean. Not that cleaning is a problem. It cleans up in a snap. It's small makes storage easy. I highly recommend this item!
3,decent food scale,"Scale takes a couple seconds longer than others to load and reset. Also, the weigh surface seems to be a little small for normal plates and tupperware.None-the-less, it works fine."
1,Scale not as described.,"Seems accurate but the scale I received measured only in grams,not ounces as described. Also, it doesn't run on AA batteriesbut a single CR 2430 3-volt ""coin"" type cell which is harder to find.I returned the unit!"
3,Product is fairly unreliable,"This product is small and fits well without taking up a lot of space. It is easy to use and set up. However, I do find it to be some what un reliable. On many occassions when it is turned on numbers will show up in the display then turn off. After restarting ~5 times the unit will then reset to 0 grams ready to use."
2,tiny and weak,"this thing is just a bit bigger than a cd, so there is not much room to do anything on it, you have to put a bowl or something on top of it to use it effectivley. Also, I did not find it very accurate, as I have a 1lb weight to test with. I found mine at least 10% off. Spend your money on something else more effective."
3,False Advertisement,"The description of this scale stated that it required AA batteries, however, upon receipt of the scale i was disappointed to find that it uses a lithium battery. Otherwise, the scale works well."
1,quit working after 8 months,This item quit working after about eight months' of normal use. Not recommended.
4,Genuine sounding karaoke,"I purchased this CD because one of the songs is to be used in my upcoming wedding. The songs on this kareoke compilation sound more like the original versions than others I had listened to. I preferred to have no background vocals at all, but this CD still has some. Overall, a good pick."
1,Contains parabens x2,"Avoid this product.If you are unaware, Parabens are endocrine disruptors and this product contains TWO of these man-made chemicals. If you are trying to balance your estrogen dominance you don't want to lather on parabens. Parabens are Estrogenic!! There are four parabens with different prefixes but all ending in -paraben.Do your body and the environment a favor. Avoid these products.Think DES, DDT and Parabens - all bad for you, your children and the environment"
3,difficult to rate for age and personality,"My son was only 6 but obsessed with anatomy - detailed, college level anatomy. BUT, when he attempted to play with his toy he found himself frustrated and angry. The pieces don't stay, he said. It keeps falling out.Now, I kept my rating high because it is impossible yet to know if the limitation was the toy itself or my son's age-appropriate but limited fine motor skills (or simple lack of patience). We boxed it up and put it away for awhile and will try again.So just tread lightly and gauge your child's interest, age, dexterity, and patience with ""it only goes back together one way"" before picking this well-intended edutoy up."
1,Don't buy this coffee maker!,"When I first saw this maker I was intrigued by it's sleek Euro-cool style. I was slightly dismayed by the fact that there is no timer, clock, or auto shutoff; however, those were properties I knew going in didn't exist.After I started using the Villaware, I liked it ok. It made coffee in a standard way, no better or worse than any other pot I've used in the past.I had it for six months and then the spring broke that lets you use the 'sneak-a-cup' feature. This is after completely normal use. Not too long after that, the pot's burner plate has burned itself off and it leaks from underneath.This is the worst coffee maker I have ever used. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up. As for me, I'm going back to my handy standby--the Black and Decker SmartBrew Plus. Consumer Reports has this coffee maker listed as 'CR Best Buy', and I've never had a problem with it."
2,"First one was great, second one was junk.","I purchased this coffeemaker and it has performed perfectly for about three years. I friend noticed it and was impressed with its style, so we purchased them one as a gift. The gift had flaws which made it unusable. The spring was installed improperly and the valve to shut off the flow was so low that the carafe could not be removed. We're not talking hard to remove, we're talking impossible to remove. Villawares customer service was a joke,...""Sorry we no longer service that model, it's discontinued."""
1,"Poorly made, Broke in a few months.","Interesting and attractive design but very poorly made. The spring in the ""Sneak a cup"" valve broke in just a few weeks. Avoid the hassle and get a more reliable design"
5,"Good Adapter, but no cable","I start by saying I made a careless mistake. I was looking for a DVI to HDMI cable and ended up buying this on accident. This adapter works fine so far, but there is no difference in picture quality between this and the component cables I was using previously. I do not know if it is worth the price premium. Maybe I will notice an improvement in picture in the future, but as of right now, I do not think I would purchase this item if I had to do it all over again."
4,Excellent but pricey,"It works excellent for what it is for. Nontheless the difference with other adapters is almost not existent (Tested with a GrandWega, 50""). If you have the money, go ahead with this, you cannot be wrong. But if it is pricey for you try an alternative, it wont affect the image at all."
2,Okay...,"Not that great, especially if you aren't into compilations composed largely of dance versions of top 20 pop songs."
5,Angel/Andy Hallett/Lorne essentials,"I bought the cd version of this from Pannetta.I *love* Andy Hallett, (Lorne/The Host, Angel) and the voice of Archie, a perfect sidekick to Anne Manx, a private eye determined to find out why girls from Chromius are in trouble. It's fast and funny and a must for any Andy Hallett fan. Listen to the sample.Andy also stars in Chance, a film by Amber Benson."
1,Not happy...,"It's amazing how one can rely one a single review on amazon.com, as I did and yet I still feel I got burned. Do check out to see if the person has reviewed any other items. This piece of crud is rudimentary and mechanical in both its looks and function. It's not art, it's merely badly riveted together tat and just looks crude and cheap. The picture in amazon's ad displays an almost mercurian look, yet this item looks like it should be part of my water heater.I gave this as a gift to a loved one... I would've preferred to give the wrapping paper it came in, instead. What a waste."
2,Not complete,"This cliff notes was published prior to 1991 - when the book Black Boy was republished with both Black Boy and the later American Hunger as one book. This only covers part 1 of the new version of the book that most people have to read. Save yourself the money and buy another ""help"" book - check the publication date..."
3,it was an ok book in my view,"the book lacked a lot of interest , i read it about a few weeks ago in school , me being a high school junior and thought that the book was very boring and that i should not have to read it , by this time you are probally saying to yourself thats what all kids say , but it is very , very true , i live in a town in the north eastern part of the country were i never experienced the subject of seguration but i really don't care i know that to prevent the past we must read and learn about it but i really honestally don't care what some little kid when threw as a kid, i do not view myself as a racist person but i feel that i don;t need to lear about it , thank you for takeing the time to read my review and i was grateful to write one for you Thanks you"
3,Good book but difficult reading,"Mr Clark has written an informative book but I had major problems following along with the Russain names of towns and rivers that this conflict was all about. The maps in the book were very poor quality and without them the book became a very confused mess. Mr Clark knows his history but I felt the book's layout could have been much better. When you read ten Russian names of rivers and cities on one page alone, and have no idea where they are...it's a bit confusing.He also throws in countless names of generals on both sides which only adds to the confusion. I found myself re-reading many paragraphs over again because I lost my bearings on names, cities, rivers, etc. etc."
4,A good book for understanding an undermined saga of the War,"I respect the author for trying to tell the reader about the largest land invasion in history.but I agree with the Moscovite's opinion that It's a fine essay with a deceptive name. It should be called The Eastern Front. I didn't like the broad base strategy Clark took on this book because one would have to touch base on EVERY Major Campaign in that region of the war. Which would give you several volumes. I liked the analysis of the US role during stalingrad because of the wheat, steel, and jeeps among other things that proved to be crucial for stopping Nazi Germany."
4,VG narrative history of the Eastern Front,"This is an excellent read about the most important conflict of the 20th century - if the USSR looses this war, God help us - as Goering said about the Nazis' need for victory.The excellence gets marred when the author pursues his politcal agenda - as in the last part of the book. FDR was a demented fool and if we had all just listened to churchill, everything would be OK."
4,A good look from the strategic level.,"Paul W. Rose (pwrose3333@aol.com) from Chicago, IL, doesn't know what he's talking about. The author makes no claims that he'll tell the story from the individual soldier's point of view! He does, however, provide a great look at ""the conflict"" from the strategic level, which is exactly what he set out to do! And as far as not revising, the author clearly stated he had reviewed the new Soviet documents and found that his text still stood up i.e.it didn't need revision.If you're a history novice maybe this book's not for you. If you're a WWII buff this book must be in your library!"
3,Well written but tends to lose reader's interest,"Alan Clark's Barbarossa is a strange book. Well written with several highly interesting and readable portrayals of incidents small and large it also has a strange habit of losing the reader's (mine anyway) interest from time to time. That said those incidents are memorable, such as a sniper contest in Stalingrad and some Germans' search for valuables. Mr. Clark can write a good story although continuance is sometimes rather troublesome. Barbarossa is a fine book, given the chance I would have rated her at three and a half stars. Barbarossa is in no way a short work, but given the scope of the German-Russian conflict the book might have been better with another couple of hundred pages (hmm sounds strange)."
3,Good but not a general history of the Eastern Front war,"Prospective readers (& purchasers!) should be cautioned - Clark is quite forthright that his book does NOT cover the entire Russo-German conflict. It focuses on selected high points - the 1941 campaign, Stalingrad, etc. Particularly towards 1944-45, it becomes sketchy indeed.It's well written, tho admittedly dated as others have noted; should be no one's first/only book on the Eastern Front, unless your interest is casual."
1,Pass on this one.,"Another hatred filled book about WWII. The author fills this mostly well-researched book with inflammatory propaganda regarding Germany and its peoples, while ignoring the nightmarish crimes of the Red Army. All Soviet troops are depicted as heros while each and every German soldier is painted as a demon. The author admits in the preface to this latest edition of depicting the German peoples unfairly, but changes not a word of text. The hatred and discrimination ruin an otherwise fine book."
4,talented family,she comes from the same talented family that gave us chu-chu Valdes and their father Bebo Valdes. She has been singing for a long time...but never recorded as a leader...her range is unbelivable...I don't think she has any limitations...it's just mind bugling that there are sooo much talented people in Cuba...everything in this Cd is first class..her voice..the band..the entire chemistry...this is a kind of CD which could be called a concept album...anotherwords...if you just play it..from the begining to the end..the whole album seems to be one long cut...it will get you...she can sing very rythmicaly..she can scat the bebop..she can sing very romantic latin bolero...she can do it all...just don't stop the music...
4,for a cook with experience,"Because the recipes do not go into great detail regarding process, it is best if you know something about making jams and jellies. That said, if you've ever had a Christine Ferber jam or jelly (and my favorite is her Isfahan--a beautiful concoction of rose water, raspberries and lychees), and live neither in Paris nor Tokyo (where her products are available) then you just may be forced to making them yourself. It is worth it!"
5,Fabulous!,"Christine Ferber's artisanal jams at Au Relais des Trois Epis are to die for!This book contains 70 unique recipes, guaranteed to dazzle friends, family and co-worker's alike. So far I've made the Nectarine, Pear & Vanilla Jam, Strawberry Jam with Black Pepper & Fresh Mint, as well as the Lemongrass & Garden Raspberry Jam--all with stunning results. The recipes are surprisingly simple--fresh picked fruit, sugar, lemon and a little patience (the prep time for some jams require the ingredients sit overnight, or over the course of a few days--trust me, the flavor in the end is outstanding!) The only drawback to this book is that, for beginners, you will probably have to supplement another [book] for basic instruction (methods, safety, etc.), as this is more suited to those with jamming backgrounds. Other than that, it is a fabulous treat for those of us who cannot make it to Alsace to visit her lovely boulangerie-ptisserie!"
4,So easy and tasty!!,I just discovered my love of canning and preserving. I love this book! Made the Fig and Vanilla jam and it was amazing. Very simple. I like that a lot of the recipes break thing up over two days. It lets me throw thing together and simmer while cooking dinner and finish up the next day. If you are looking for some sophisticated flavors this is the book for you!
3,Very French,Nothing for people who like low sugar or sugar alternatives. Very traditional french recipes.Fun recipes for different types of fruits not readily available
4,Yummy!,"Very nice book, well translated and presented. Hard back. Needs more photos for myself. I live in Australia so alot of the recipes are not really relevant to me but can make some good substitutions of ingredients."
2,Not what I expected,"I personally thought this book would be jammed packed with new recipes and info. Although it's a beautifully, well put together book, it's more a coffee table style book rather than a book I'll use for all my canning needs.There are others I'd choose from first, before this book for my canning needs."
2,Too theoretical-- not practical!,"Probably the worst book ever written by the integrated marketing communications guru, Don E. Schultz -- an IMC professor at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern.It is too conceptual and theoretical. The real world does not really do IMC quite like that. IMC is still both art and science. The author(s) tend to look at IMC, from a branding perspective, in a dry,boring, and uncreative fashion.Many jargons have been invented in the book. But are they really practical? The book has not thrown in enough cases or examples to explain or illustrate most of the untested theories or concepts convincingly.Personally, I guess Beth E. Barnes did most of the writing, and Don E. Schultz did most of the so called new concepts or theories invention.I recommend books like Experiental Marketing, Experience Economy-- they are far more interesting, and practical!"
3,book about salt is detailed and interesting,"The author has collected information from many human societies in writing a generic treatise on the many uses of salt. He emphasises that it is not just used for flavoring and preserving food.I am of mixed mind about the way the book is organized. It seems to hop around a bit, but I am not sure that I could suggest a different organization. It is interesting to compare the traditional Chinese method of NEVER sprinkling salt on food, but having salty products to eat separately or to be used with a sauce, with the Western practice of sprinkling salt on everything but dessert."
2,"Salt, a difficult topic","You have to be a certain type person to enjoy reading about the history of salt. That said, this book has a lot of fascinating facts. However, they are poory tied together and it is very difficult to read this book in its entirety. I'll chalk some of it up to the difficulty of the topic. It looks neat on the bookshelf though."
4,Pleasant surprise,"This didn't sound very interesting by the title, but turned out to be fascinating. I really had no idea of salt's role in world history prior to reading this book. BTW, if in Poland, definitely visit the salt mine mentioned in the book, the tour is great."
2,a disappointment,"i bought this because i really like reading different takes on world history (""a history of the world in 6 glasses"" by tom standage, for example). the best way to describe this book is to compare it to my 'history of the south' professor from college. he took a what has the potential to be a fascinating subject and made it b-o-r-i-n-g. despite the fact that it was poorly written--i'm sorry but a published author should be able to find more interesting prepositional introductions than ""in fact""--it jumps from place to place. i think it was supposed to be following a rough timeline, but it didn't do it very well. and, there are far too many recipes. are we actually supposed to try them? like the ones for preserving human bodies?"
4,The only rock that human's eat,"A very dry book and alittle too much unnecessary detail from the past, especially about China. However, the author really does a superb job talking about the role of salt in our diet today. As a physician, I found the information very helpful in my practice and also helps me understand more the physiological role that salt plays in our bodies."
3,"Interesting, then boring, then interesting again","Starts off very well...the first hundred pages or so are filled with interesting facts about salt and world history. Then it falls apart in the middle, droning on and on about how various countries produced salt and tried to corner markets. It felt like I was doing homework and just had to get through it. It gets interesting again near the end, discussing Gandhi's protest of the salt tax in India, and British colonialism.I'm glad I finished it, but if I had to start again I think I'd rather shave my scrotum and pour salt on the open wounds that would likely result"
1,Book group denial,"I suggested this to my book group and they all commented back to me even before our meeting to discuss and said it was so boring and they couldn't even get through the 2nd chapter. Now we just get to sit, eat and gossip for our book group meeting. Better luck next time it's my turn to choose, I hope."
1,Book was HORRIBLE,My son had to read this book as required reading for school but he said it was a horrible book to read.
1,If you read this for pleasure you're insane,"I am a rising sophomore in high school and this book was my summer reading assignment for world history. To sum up the book briefly: I never once sat down to it without falling asleep. The historical content was bland and much of it was not even about the mineral itself. Kurlansky wandered off topic throughout the entire book and continued to go on random tangents about wars and foods unrelated to salt's pivotal role in the history of the world throughout the exposition. I would never recommend this book to anyone, unless of course I enjoyed watching them suffer for 450 pages on end."
2,Not Worth Its Salt,"I found several errors of fact in only a few pages, which makes me wonder how many other errors are to be found in this book. Sadly, I just cannot trust it as a source."
3,Not so hot on chemistry,"An interesting volume, but skip the chapter, ""The Odium of Sodium."" The author, along with his editor and researcher deserve a good salting over the errors in this chapter. I'll list a few examples:""...gunpowder which was potassium nitrate."" Actually, gunpowder contains potassium nitrate, sulfur, and charcoal.""Epsom salts is now used... ... in explosives."" No way.""...sodium carbonate in the form of baking soda."" Sorry, it's sodium bicarbonate.""...carbonyl chloride... Known as as mustard gas. Wrong again. It's known as phosgene.And the errors continue. It makes me wonder how many errors exist in the other sections of the book."
3,Not for everyone,"The previous reviewer Richard A. Mitchell nailed the problem with this book. It has no life. It was disapointing after reading Cod. The book is reems of trivia. Good for trivia hounds who wish to be salt geek experts, or for salt industry insiders, and people who live in Salt mine towns that want to know their history. For the general reader, there are interesting elements, but I think his approach to history hit gold with Cod and a dud with salt, the subject matter is just not that interesting historically for this length of a book. He covers so much ground, time and geographic, with such little depth on each, the only connection he can draw at the end is the irony that people sell a substance which is freely available -- a conclusion not exactly particular to salt or even that interesting or insightful."
1,Underwhelming,"The book spends far too much time on recipes for salted fish. The author repeats himself in other cases too, with some editing this could have been a much better book."
4,Salt: A World History,The text is a bit austere but terribly informative and historically significant ... this is a vital history of one of civilizations unique veins of development.
2,A slow read that strings together old cooking recipes,"There is so much history to salt, how it is needed by humans and how it has altered human history. Unfortunately, this book does not take advantage of this rich background. Instead it simply reprints long tracts of old letters or ancient food recipes without explaining the context or moving the reader. A good history strings a story together and illuminates the reader, I am disappointed that 'Salt' fails to do this."
3,Could have been half as long,"The author does an OK job of tying the history of the world together using the subject of salt. However, he could have done it in half the words, and the connections are not very good. All and all, it was an OK book to read."
4,A Seasoned World History,"It took me awhile to pick up this book. I had read about it, had seen it profiled in bookstores, and heard some water cooler talk about it. Too bad I waited so long. Kurlansky has a tremendous style which is more of a narrative - informative and interesting - nowhere near an academic lecture. Basically this is a world history through the lens of salt...and it works. Salt has influenced religion, trade, foreign policy, war, culture, diet and family. I will never look at a salt shaker the same way again."
5,A surprisingly fascinating read,"A friend read the first half of this book in a rental house and raved about it so much (without even having finished it) that I promptly ordered and read it.""Salt"" takes on the world history of a commodity that, in times past, was the impetus for exploration, political oppression, and social change. What we take for granted today as the most ubiquitous seasoning on the planet was once a rare and prized substance that literally meant the difference between life and death in the pre-Frigidaire era.I was roundly mocked by friends and family for reading a book like ""Salt"" - what could possibly be interesting about the world history of salt? A lot, actually. And I enjoyed the book so much that I feel like I got the last laugh."
2,Engaging but Error Prone,"Kurlansky's book is interesting and easy-to-read (I think he has an excellent, very straight-forward, non-convoluted writing style). However, his book contains a lot of errors. For example: He has magnesium in light bulbs (it used to be in flash bulbs), and only nitrates in old-time gun powder (it also contained charcoal and usually sulphur). It's disconcerting to not know what else to believe. Also, I'm disapointed that none of the editorial reviews shown seem to address his errors."
1,Fun with Non-Facts,"Engagingly written, broad in concept, Salt, A World History, contained so many errors that I felt nothing the author wrote could be trusted. For a list of 47 errors, including those found by other readers, e-mail me at kauffman37@yahoocom"
4,A great read,"This book took an item we take for granted today, salt, and discussed its history. Some have criticized the author for including so many recipes. I disagree. Salt is used in cooking after all, and to put salt into a proper context we need to witness how it was used.I enjoyed how the author wove the various aspects of the salt trade into a coherent history. For instance, that salt was so important in wartime never struck me before, though it seems obvious now.A good, hard to put down read, Salt: A World History is a good book for people who like history, economics or the culinary arts."
5,Exceptional non-fiction,"I read very little non-fiction, but this book was so full of interesting facts that it was almost impossible to put down. Kurlansky's account of mankind's quest for salt and the commerce it created is indeed a mini-history of civilization. The book is well written, easy to read, and holds the reader's interest from first page to last. I found myself reaching for it again and again to find out what happens next. Who would have dreamed that a common every-day product that we take for granted could have such a rich, varied history? Kurlansky did a wonderful job!"
3,Needs a little salt,"Mark Kurlansky's super-spare language occasionally strips passion from his methodical study, at times rendering a colorful journey into a death march of facts. Thank goodness he loosens up after the first six chapters, leaving behind blow-by-blow accounts of cheese-making in Parma (""The difference between fresh cheese and aged cheese is salt"") for richer territory. A chapter entitled ""The Hapsburg Pickle"" takes us deep into the salt mines of central Europe, where Polish miners transformed the caves of Wieliczka into rock salt chapels and the owners brought guests into salt ballrooms via underwater lagoons. Later chapters take us into the New World, to the banks of the Dead Sea, and alongside the derricks of Zigong--fascinating journeys that reveal surprising connections among commerce, cuisine, and control.A great read, once you make it past the first hundred pages."
3,Interesting Reading,"The book is too lenghty (450 pages). The author describes how different societies valued and used salt but he wanders off the topic at too many occassions. For example, the inclusion of a number of recipes where salt plays a very minor part is totally unnecessary. Overall, the book is still relatively interesting even though I would not really consider it a must read."
4,Salt History,An interesting perspective of the impact that the salt trade has had on history.Towards the end of the book I became aware of similarities with another book on the history of Cod fish. Only after the book was finished that I discovered that it was by the same author.
4,"Not as good as COD, but still worth a read","Salt, before reading this book I hadn't really paid any attention to it. Yeah I buy iodized salt to prevent goiter. But I never knew why Morton table salt didn't clump from moisture. And I knew about the camels carrying salt blocks in the desert of North Africa. But with the ocean being full of it, I didn't think that at anytime would it have been a rare commodity. This book does a pretty good job of tying world events to this edible rock. I also readCod: A Biography of the Fish that Changed the Worldand I liked that book better. They both try to tie a single thing into a world history narrative and Cod does a better job of it. But I did enjoy reading this book, and if world energy prices rise, so too will the cost of salt.Recommended."
3,Excellent first third and then it gets kind of dull,"The history of salt sounds less than amazing until you realize it shadows all human development and you learn why. Civilization depended on the ability to find, eat, process, secure and sell it. About 1/3 of the way through the book that is pretty fully explained and it is quite fascinatin and then the story moves on to the more mundane aspects of the industrial revoloution and salt used mroe and more in food etc etc.Overall a good read and quite informative."
3,"Tedious, but still interesting","The historical, political and social aspects are interesting and, at times, make you say, ""Wow, I didn't know that.""The detailed descriptions of how various civilizations made salt (only about 4-5 different ways)should be skipped after the first episode and the recipes ignored altogether.All and all, probably worth the time"
1,Spiceless,"I found this book thoroughly disappointing. I was at first intrigued by the title, and looked forward to exploring what I hoped would be an interesting topic. But after getting about half-way through the book, I could no longer continue reading it. It has no logical order, and constantly moves forward and backward through the timeline. It goes into far too much detail about the most boring aspects of the salt trade, and neglects to draw the reader in. The more I read, the less I cared about this vital mineral. If there is much to learn about salt, this text makes it not worth the effort to learn."
4,HISTORY : Salted and well preserved,"It does not flow as well as his less meandering effort Cod but it gives one a clear perspective of the flow of human history especially when salt stood alone as a scarce, precious, life sustaining compound. The clear picture of the mercantile giant, the Hanseatic League, lets one compare it to the globe straddeling corporations and industry groups of today. And it was fun. Learning the origin of ketchup and reading recipes for ancient cheese and ham, while gaining a good picture of the evolving world from ancient times forward, in one volume, is uncommon."
1,Salt,"Salt is an amazing compilation of the uses of the most sought after commodity ever. Kurlansky speaks with great eloquence about every detail and use. Although it is great the book drags on and on while repeating what has already been said about ten times. For instance, salted fish is mentioned as a great trade commodity for many ancient european cultures. Despite the fact that the information about salted fish is interesting and well written it seems as though it is mentioned about ten times every five pages. I could not bring myself to complete this book."
2,Repetitious,"A repetious assembly of odd bits, anecdotes and recipes (a lot of recipes), some quite interesting , some not. Repetitious. Occasionally fatuous, occessionally fascinating, always repetitious. He repeats a lot. Says the same thing over and over. Talks about how to evaporate salt from sea water a lot. Repetitious. Very very very repetitous."
4,too salty,"While the author does a good job with the historical aspects showing how the controlof the salt trade helped to forge some ancient empires, he spends a bit too much timeon describing how salt was used in various ancient recipes."
4,very informative,This book was very informative on the history and uses of salt. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read
5,History told in an appetizing way...,"I wish Mr. Kurlansky had been my history teacher....he makes history easy to understand, learn and see, while writing about normal everyday things and happenings, explaining how and why it was in the past and how it is now and changed the future. And all in an easy storyteller way."
2,Not Worth Its Salt,"I gave up on it after reading for a while, and then skimming. I was a bit put off when I read that salt is the only rock we eat. Not true: we eat clay in candy, muscovite in candy, ground up quartzite in various products, and so on. The book seems better suited to those interested in cooking. The science, on the other hand, was too elementary for me. The importance of Salt in political history sounded overrated to me."
5,Fascinating,"Read Kurlansky's Cod first, it serves as a preamble to this book and this book is a great joy to read. It is easily my favorite book I read last year. Well written, well researched, wonderful tale of salt and what it did to shape our history. If you're reading this review just buy the book, you will be very happy you did."
2,Watch your SALT intake,"Where oh where was the editor when Mr. Kurlansky submitted his book. Salt has a long history but did Mr. Kurlansky think he needed to take us through every century with every bit of the minutiae of Salt's history? After awhile I began to edit the chapters as I read and I saw how easily Mr. Kurlansky's book could have become the readable and not the painful book it was...It seemed that every fact whether concerned with Salt, sugar or cinnamon made it's way into this book. At the end he was even compelled to tell us when the miner's safety hat wasinvented...STOP please stop...this book can contribute to high blood pressure for the reader....."
2,Entertaining stories,"Salt is a collection of stories with one thing in common: salt. However, it is not a book of history, needless to say it is not a book of world history, as the title claims. It is more a compilation of readable stories about events in history that are more or less related to salt and fish."
2,My God it's BOOOOOORRRRRRRIIIIINNNNGGGGGG@!,"It's very informative for sure, but good luck staying awake trying to read it. In all honesty, I only made it through about 1/2 the book. I found 'Cod' a much more enjoyable read...."
4,"Salt, Salted Cod and The Basques","Some members reviewing this book correctly understood the interconnection between the author's living with and researching the Basques, who were really among the first discovers of America where they fished and salt-dried the cod. From this came the thread that one of my favorite authors expanded and explored. Kurlansky does indeed write in a relatively straightforward style, narrating directly what he sees and learns - and ultimately shares with the reader.Coming alone to this work without the linked background could well puzzle a new reader of his works - The Basques, Cod and Salt are really a Trilogy or Triptych of theme, if not fact.I enjoyed the recipes in all the books and tried them out on my long-suffering wife. She did not enjoy the Salt-dried Cod caught and boxed by the Basque even when I dressed it with a favorite sauce, but I did, all three."
5,The most earmarked book in my library,"Few people today realize how essential salt was to our survival for thousands of years. Before canning and refrigeration, it was the primary way we preserved food. This kind of understanding, thanks to a new crop of writers like Kurlansky, is what should be taught in school rather than rote memorization of dates. Interesting history books such as Salt truly have the ability to give people new perspectives on how the world was shaped. Page after page brought me fascinating insights. For those interested in just how much salt was worth, I would recommend learning more about West Africa inThe Golden Trade of the Moorswhich actually goes all the way back to Carthage."
3,Meh,"I thought ""Cod"" was better-written, this felt pretty much like trivia nuggets thrown at me. Cod felt more seamless, like a narrative. Still, it was interesting and I'll likely read more by this author."
3,Can Anyone Really Care About Salt This Much?,"Salt was indeed crucial to the development of human civilization: it preserved meat and fish, and provided crucial nutrients for our mental and physical development. It was for our ancestors as important a commodity as oil and water are for us today.But to write a book about salt is as challenging and as ambitious as trying to write a book about water or oxygen or even about thinking. The result is that this book is scattered all over the place, and it's difficult to get drawn into this book. Can anyone really care about salt this much?"
2,This Is A Cookbook,"Salt has an interesting history of formation and useage. Unfortunately we get a lot of the one and very little of the other. Looking at Mr Kurlansky's publishing history, we see that he is a food writer and this explains a lot.I liked hisThe Basque History of the World: The Story of a Nation. If ""Salt"" were more likeSand: The Never-Ending Storyit would have been much better, for me."
2,Salt: a book about nothing,"Do you have trouble sleeping at night? If you do, read salt: a world history. I will knock you right out!"
2,You really have to be interested in salt,"I thought this book would be more about world history, following salt as a narrative. But the book is really about salt. The book does trace salt through history, but it is really about salt and not about the period and how salt fit into the times. So if you are really interested in salt this is a good book, otherwise I would skip."
2,Beware of Inaccuracies?,"The part of this book with which I am most familiar professionally contains numerous errors of historical fact; if the author made this many mistakes in so few pages, how many other errors might he have made that I don't know about?"
2,A mountain of salt,"The information the author presents on this common material so important to biology, commerce and industry would have made an entertaining, informative book of a hundred pages or so. Unfortunately the real book has four hundred and forty-nine pages.I never finished it."
2,Reads like someone's lame thesis,"Man, this didn't work at all for me. Here's why:- It zipped past the ancient history (which is what I like) and spent most of its time on European and (white) American history (which I usually already know and don't care about anyway).- You know how in college you would find some weird tangent to write your paper on so it would seem somewhat original? This book feels like a whole bunch of those essays. I get it, salt was important, but it still feels forced sometimes.- After a while, you start to get that dreaded ""I'm reading history"" feeling, where it all starts to look like a list of names and dates. It's totally possible to write history without writing lists; I just don't think this book pulled it off.Here's the impression I came away from this book with: ""15th-century Germans really liked salt. Here's how they made it. You know who else liked salt? 16th-century French people. Here's a recipe that uses salt. Guess who else liked salt?"" Ad infinitum.Meh."
3,Could have been much better,"This book probably should have been a New Yorker magazine article. It isn't necessary to discuss every salt mine and brine well in Europe to make a point.The author fills the pages telling aspects of the story of salt in a disconnected manner. By shifting from place to place and back and forth in time, whatever historical theme the author was trying to present is hopelessly lost. Here's' what emerges from this book: Salt used to be scarce and was a key commodity in world trade because of its value as a nutrient and in preservation of meat. Now it's abundant and not as important to the global economy.The writing is haphazard; as other reviewers note, the science is bad; and, interesting anecdotes aren't woven together to make a real point."
3,Important History that the Book Does Not Mention,"Overall, I have enjoyed reading this book for its interesting historical facts. However, no where in the book does Kurlansky mention the biggest salt deposit in the United States that was discovered in Hutchinson, Kansas, the Salt City. Today along with a working salt mine, there is an underground salt museum there, one of the few in the world and, correct me if I am wrong, the only one in North America. This museum gives a unique perspective on how salt is mined. Not mentioning the significance of the Hutchinson salt mines is the one downside of the book."
2,Fails to crystallize,"Kurlansky's text is fragmentary and spotty, jumping from notion to notion without deeply examining any of them. For example, he has a chapter purporting to be about the geology of salt, but it actually covers petroleum and preservation; the bits on geology are scattered everywhere else.Worse is the regular occurance of factual errors, half-truths, and pure mistakes, appearing on nearly every page of the book. If an author wants to write about a chemical compound, he ought at least to know a little chemistry. Kurlansky claims that no one knows why the sea is salty; suggests that water can be 'cooked' out of salt; does not understand hygroscopy; cannot reliably identify which ions are reponsible for basic and which for acidic properties; and may not know what a redox reaction is.The 'salt' article on Wikipedia is better."
4,Don't Under Estimate the Importance of Salt!,I found this book to be an easy read providing me with great insight into mankind's dependence on salt. There are just so many little interesting facts and stories that I found interesting! Any scientist or historian will find this book intriguing!
2,Difficult to finish,"I've always been infatuated with food history and how it has influenced every part of our lives, but this is one stagnant read. By the umpteenth time the book delves back into English colonialism, I wasn't sure I could make it through. Granted, I assume information about that period in time is far more plentiful than earlier periods, but revisiting time, time, time, time and time again didn't make for a very interesting read. There were many Countries seeking to edge out others by controlling salt production. Be prepared to have that fact demonstrated to you many times across a couple hundred pages.It has its moments, but overall disappointing."
2,"An overview, not a study",Kurlansky's book covers many areas superficially. My interest would be held by a book giving more detaisl on thehistory of fewer areas..
5,Brilliant and informative,The history of salt .who knew it could be so interesting informative interesting and indeed fascinating .I recommend to anyone .great read
2,Well-hydrated + Mark's Book = Dehydration,"I was drawn in by Mark's subtle hints at salt's major influence in society from words such as 'salary' (worth your salt) to salt's comparability to other rocks, such as gold, but it was all these recipes and tips about brining meats and pickling this, that, and those, that led me to delete this rather slow and dehydrated read."
5,"Honestly, Money is great","Outstanding, methodical review of the purposes and abuses of money. Readers will better understand why the current socialist world meltdown might not ever have happened if we followed the honest wisdom of American constitutional principles. Beautifully illustrated gift for discerning believers in liberty and sound, honest economics!"
1,bait and switch,"I ordered ONE one hundred box of combs at a sale priceand then sent ONE comb. Not acceptable, it was obviouslya sale price as the original price was slashed throughand SALE price listed. They said they would refund mymoney, but I wanted what I paid for, 100 combs for the price."
1,wonderfully dull,"A Kantian nightmare wrapped in a Newtonian universe of sterility, this book's influence in the International Relations field is all out of proportion to its intrinsic worth. It should be shrinkwrapped and buried in a lead vault for ten thousand years, and then unearthed to demonstrate for future generations the loathsome state of social studies in the late 1970s."
1,waltz me to sleep,"Waltz's bourbon-esque treatise is an exploration in alchoholist-influenced social science dementia. Chapter One is a theoretical bow-tie, an analytical pseurosis of the liver. Chapter two stumbles forward like a hurling wino, assumptions swinging wildly like fists through the air. The remaining chapters are a blur. The next morning, you'll have a headache"
5,An excellent in-depth review on the Mithraic Mysteries,"This book is simply great. The theories introduced by David Ulansey are absolutely innovative if compared to what is the current average knowledge of scholars, archeologist and experts on the religion of Mithra. The book provides large evidence in support of the theories, as well as disseminates intriguing questions and answers about cosmogony and salvation in the ancient world. Most of all it is a book written with an outstanding passion, but also very easy to read, and therefore may easily suit not only the scholar but also anyone interested in the subject, or simply curious and also students from high school onwards."
5,this book just grabs you,i like most people read the reviews first or get a recommendation on which book to buy before purchasing and this is exactly what i did for this one . this book does read like a detective story and the author is sure to include all the details you would need to make up your own mind regarding his theories . although alot cannot be confirmed due to there being little to no written historical records on the religon of mithras he does a very good job in providing whatever evidence there is . in a way he manages to bring you back in time and have you look at the universe through the eyes and mind of the ancients in order to understand how this cult came to be . this is an excellent book for anyone getting started in understanding this religon .
1,Steer Clear of This,"Ulansey's thesis looked like a breakthrough at the time to non-specialists, but the complete indiffernce to his work by the mainstream of Mithraic researchers (Beck, Gordon, Merkelbach, Clauss, etc.), constitutes a rejection by peer review. In fact, his hypothesis about the precession of the equinoxes being the central doctrine of Mithraism is pseudo-science. Like so much Cargo Cult Science, it is a lot of just so stories cobbled together by amazing co-incidences no can see apart form the author. in fact, there is no evidence whatsoever that the precession played any role whatsoever in Mithraism. This assessment can be confirmed by the fact that Ulansey's hypothesis has proven sterile. Neither he nor anyone else has used it as the basis of further research (although he has not ceased to rewrite chapters as as if they were new articles to pad out his CV). Living, breathing science and scholarship constantly produces new results."
2,Flimsy Design,"This is a handsome bag with all the useful pockets I wanted, but it's not very sturdy.THE STRAP is secured to the bag with only a single small 1/4-inch rivet on each side. There is also some polyester stitching to the bag above the rivet, but I found that tears out with very little use.A RECTANGULAR RING connects the strap on one side. The ring is not welded, although it seems strong enough, but it is too large for the purpose. Thus, the strap is always getting twisted out of shape. This, in turn, has contributed to tearing the stitching from the bag above the rivet on that side.SOFT VELCRO is used to close the bag instead of a clasp. This very convenient, but after a month it is already very worn."
1,Disappointing,"This book was written in 1997, before Brockman honed her storytelling skills to the high level they are today. The characters are one-dimensional, the plot simplistic, and the book is just plain boring. There are a few hints of the excellent writer that Brockman will become, but there are not enough of them to make reading this book worthwhile."
3,Just so so,"I'm usually a fan, but this book seemed to be rushed, not nearly as well developed as her usual products. I found it disappointing."
3,Ladies' Man,"I didn't get this book. I never felt like the characters got to know one another. They just jumped from lust to love without a natural progression. If Sam was so anti-relationships, he certainly came around awful fast to be the one to pursue the relationship. Oh well... plenty more books to read."
1,What's that Smell?!?,"Like many people have said, this cover fit the ironing board perfectly and clothes iron well on top of it.But, when you iron, it STINKS!! If you are like me, you'll be shopping for a new cover after ironing a few times."
1,BEWARE! Coating coats your iron!,"The first time I used this cover, I went over it with my steam iron (set on 'cotton') to smooth it out. The cover immediately coated the mirror surface on the bottom of my iron with blue sticky stuff. I spent the next half hour cleaning it off with vinegar, since water wouldn't do the job. Then I fished my old cover out of the trash can and threw the new blue one in."
3,Ironing Board Cover,"The Whitney Design 2020 Blue-Silicone 54 inch Ironing Boad Replacement Pad and cover arrived as indicated.The cover fits my current ironing board top but is wrinkled around the edges due to the fitting arrangement. This causes some difficulty with ironing sleeves, collars and smaller items. As I use it more, these wrinkles are smoothing out and are not a significant problem.Thank you for the opportunity to respond to your product.Linda L."
3,Ironing Board Cover,"I measured the Board and bought a cover based on the size. It fits very well, and looks nice on the board."
1,Quits working!!!,"When it works, it makes beautiful waffles, but unfortunately it just quits heating up. The first one I purchased quit heating up after only the third use. I took it back to the store and replaced it with a new one. This one lasted for 6 uses and quit working on me this morning right in the middle of a waffle."
2,Good Design. Poor Quality.,"Bought this Waffle Iron based on the Excellent reviews. Used it about 6 times before it fell into the bad reviews category. Just wouldn't heat up or work all of a sudden. Took it to the service provider who saw it was only a few months old and Waring sent them (me) a new one in about 2 weeks. Have not used the new one yet. Waiting for my nephews to visit in July so we can play with the waffle maker in July, and at least they can get some use out of it. Don't expect it to last too long after a few uses. If there was a POS category, I'd put it under that. It makes great waffles when it works, but is not a product you can count on to use for a few years. After this POS breaks again, I'll look for a stove-top waffle maker that doesn't rely on these cheap and faulty electronics."
1,"When it works, it's great, but poor hardware quality equals unhappy waffle lovers.","I got this waffle maker as a Christmas gift and we have been loving the waffles. Unfortunately, it stopped heating about a month ago. We have been tinkering with it to try and figure it out, but to no avail. I do not recommend getting this product. It is beautiful to look at and makes great waffles, but the quality of the product is sub-par."
1,worked 2 times & quit,"This is the 2nd one I have received - The 1st one worked twice & quit, so I got a replacement. It worked twice and quit also. It worked good the 2 times I got to use it, but the 3rd time it never gets hot. I believe they must have a problem with the switch.I am getting my money back this time.Amazon handled the problem very good, the product was just no good."
1,Faulty Product,"This unit made absolutely perfect waffles. But it is not built to last. I have used this only about once every two months on average and have had it for exactly three years. When I went to make waffles the other day, I flipped the unit and the iron totally and unexpectedly disengaged from the casing. As you can see from a couple of the user photos on the product page, I am not the first person to whom this has happened. And per other reviews I've read with similar problems, the magic number seems to be three years. Waffle irons should last decades (my old, $20 iron is 15 years old!). I have contacted Waring Pro for a refund or product replacement (assuming the product has been improved) and I will wait to see what they have to say. I am livid that I spent over $100 on this product and will be even more angry if Waring Pro does not provide a solution for me. I would suggest you find another waffler if you're looking at this one."
1,Big disappointment,This barely used waffle maker worked great the first couple of times we used it. Then during a breakfast with guests it simply failed to heat. Called Waring and got absolutely no satisfaction as we were told there was nothing they could do even though it was hardly ever used. Looks great but simply doesn't work. Will never purchase this brand again. Spent $90.00 on this product for about 12 waffles. Greatly disappointed!
1,Does Not Last For Long!,Worked great for just over a year and then died!Small family so not over-used. Should last much longer!Have since heard many of the same complaints from many online reviews.Would never buy a Waring Pro WMK300 or any Waring products again!
2,Shorted out,"I purchased this and after using it approx 8 times it shorted out, not worthy of purchasing another. Not professional quality at all."
2,Waring Pro Worked for about 1 year,"This waffle maker worked ok while it worked. After about a year after the warranty was up of course it quit working. We didn't abuse it or anything. We used it about once or twice a week and made 1 waffle maybe 2. Later after throwing it away I found out that it was a $1.50 fuse that burns out in the lower unit. Actually I am kind of glad, cause that gave me an excuse to look for a non teflon coated waffle iron. I found one in Germany called Nuemarker. It is listed at $500 or so. Not sure how much it really is now. Anyway I am sure that there are other non teflon waffle makers out there. You just have to look hard for them right now, until companies start to realize that we as consumer know how dangerous teflon coating really is and start to make more ceramic coated appliances."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I read the reviews on this waffle maker, but couldn't believe that a small appliance could die as so many said. They were all correct! This waffle maker makes the the best waffles ever, and makes them in a couple minutes. However, after using it a couple times, it just dies by blowing a fuse you cannot replace. So, you cannot plan on it to work! It is a waste of money to pay $70 for an appliance that works only a couple times!"
2,Nice waffle maker until it stops working,"I purchased the Waring Professional Waffle maker for my wife for a Christmas present. It worked for about a month then it stopped heating. I returned it to an authorized Waring service center and they sent me a refurbished replacement. The replacement waffle maker looked like it had been used a lot and then had a few new parts replaced on it. It was not the same quality as the original that I purchased. It was scratched, iron would not close, parts did not look like they fit etc. Also, they did not include the drip pan when they sent a replacement. If you purchase one just beware that you will not get anything close to a new replacement if it breaks. I may be looking at the Krups waffle maker now."
1,heating element keeps failing,I have purchased 2 of these appliances. The first one I purchased in December 2007 and it lasted 3 months before the heating element died. I bought a second appliance on 4/8/2008 and this one died 4/21/2008 after 3 uses. Really liked when it worked....am done with Waring Pro Waffle maker.
2,Does not last,"Research this product before buying. There are several sites that discuss the fact that it does not work after several uses. The unit will not heat, but the power light is on. This seems to be an ongoing problem. My unit stopped working after seven months and about 8 uses. Not a good value for the cost. The company wants me to send them the unit at my expense, which only adds to this unit's cost. Buyer Beware and do your research."
4,waffle maker,Nice deep pockets and the power cord can be stored out of the way underneath the unit; the only drawback is the unit is a little large (when space issues are a concern). Easy cleanup compared to other units I have owned.
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"UPDATE: November 9, 2008. I previously gave this product five stars when I first bought it. But after using it very sparingly since May 2006, it died today. The heating element dies after limited usage. This is a common problem. Believe the reviews. It makes great waffles, but don't expect this waffle maker to last long. It produced about 30 great waffles before it died. You've been warned!!"
5,So far so good,"This waffle maker was given to me for father's day, and we had perfect waffles right away.I was surprised just how fast it made waffles. We had outgrown our original because our family has grown to five. With this model, we couldn't eat them fast enough. I imagine the balance will change when we get teenagers in the house, but I was impressed. The beeper on this unit made it so I could pour the batter, sit down and eat, and only get up when the next one was ready. There was no need to monitor the baker, or even to peak between the top and bottom to check if it was done.The non-stick surface worked well.One nice consequence of the rotation feature is that the waffles cling to the upper iron when the baker is opened. This means that gravity helps you remove the waffle, making it easier.So far I have no complaints.By the way, we made a family buckwheat recipe and it worked well."
4,Great Waffles,"I used this waffle maker almost every morning at my work cafeteria a while back. Recenlty, I've been buying the frozen waffles. I figured I can save myself a lot of money buying my own. [...]. You have to pay for shipping but some stores may carry it."
1,Belgian Waffle Maker,"Having used various kinds of waffle makers, this is the best, because it has an audible beep to let me know when the waffles are ready to be taken out. It is easy to adjust and has a great tray for spill overs. The only drawback is that it is quite bulky and takes up some counter space, however, in my opinion it is worth it. J.R. - originally from Belgium"
1,Very Disappointing,"The waffle maker makes excellent waffles when it is working. However, we received the waffle maker as a gift last Christmas and it quit working this May. It is still under warranty, but without the receipt they wouldn't authorize the warranty."
1,LEMON Law should be in affect,"At first it seemed like a great deal as the waffles were perfect. As usual, if it is to good to be true, something is up.I used it sparingly over the months, minus one day for a brunch where I made about 15 waffles. I just pulled it out the other day after not using it for a few months and it died after the second waffle. It turns on, but never comes up to a temp. where you can cook anything. For the money and the other reviews I saw, I would have expected it to last MUCH longer. No return policy on this one, so I would stay away and go to a local dealer that would take it back for another return.Weak Weak Weak!!!"
3,Question about reliability,It worked well and made excellent waffles but after a few uses the heating element failed and we had to take it in for a warranty replacement.
2,"Lasts, then crashes","I've had two Waring Pro waffle makers over the years. Both were great to operate. Then, on both, the flip mechanism broke, rendering the machine inoperable. The use of plastic is the limiting factor."
2,"Lovely Waffles, But Died After the Warranty","This waffle iron makes perfect, delicious, fluffy golden waffles that are never burnt and always cooked all the way through for a wonderful consistency.That said, I was terribly sad when the waffle iron audibly shorted out this past Sunday morning, 18 months nearly to the day from when we bought it -- i.e. six months after the warranty expired, so there's nothing we can do to get it fixed. And at $90 a pop, I'm really not sure I'll be buying another of this model line. I'd rather invest a little more and get a product that will actually last."
2,Good while it worked,Have made about 80-100 waffles and the heating element stopped working. Worked great while it lasted. I use Crisco spray in the blue can and Krusteaz complete pancake mix and the release was always perfect.
1,VERY BAD MODEL!!!!! IT BURNS OUT WITHIN 1 MONTH!!!,THis model is BAD NEWS! We had it for about a month and it just stopped working on us. We only made waffles for about three times before it died. BEWARE you could lose your money on this one. Hopefully they will get their acts together and get it right. I know others with the same problem. It's great if you are lucky enough to get one that will last for more than a couple months. We had an older model that lasted three years for us but this one is a bum model.
4,"Make great waffles, but last only a few.","I had it for a couple month, and use maybe three or four times before burn out. Every time I use it, making waffles was easy with great results. Its measuring cup, ready indicator, easy flip structure, and overall easy use and apparent sturdy structure makes me purchase it, but after it burn out and after reading same experience from other user I just decide to purchase another brand (KRUPS) and so far, so good although it doesn't have the ready indicator wish I found very useful."
2,Very Good but broke within 30 days,"Loved the waffles but on 3rd use stopped getting hot. We were very disappointed however, Amazon did accept the return. Thank you Amazon."
2,The first two waffles were great and then it died....,"We fired up the waffle maker on Christmas morning and after making two perfect waffles it failed and the heating mechanism broke. Fortunately there is an authorized service center nearby my house who is handling the return. Apparently they don't try to fix these units they simply ship a brand new unit. The gentlemen at the authorized service center mentioned that they have had the same thing happen to a number of customers in the past few months with this particular unit. So yes, this is an awesome waffle maker, but you need to hope the folks in the factory were having a good day when your unit was made."
2,It worked great..while it worked,"I had 2 of these. First, Amazon's return policy is great. But, that doesn't help the product. The first one I had only worked one day. The second one a few weeks. Both did the same thing, just stopped heating up. When I went to return the second one, Amazon would not send another iron, but said that they were having problems with these so processed a complete refund. Hooray for Amazon, Boo for Waring."
2,Waring Pro Waffle Iron a Lemon,I bought this waffle iron yesterday....I was really excited about it and enjoyed some really good waffles last night. This morning I made one great waffle! The second one never was made. The waffle iron completely shut down. The red light came on but the ready light never came on again and the waffle iron is cold...will not heat up at all. I will exchange it and hopefully this machine i got is just a lemon!
5,A Family Heirloom,"I can finally make our friends secret waffle recipe without shame! On it's maiden voyage this iron was just wonderful. From the very first waffle until the end, they came out light, crispy and perfect. My previous waffle iron either under cooked or they stuck so bad to the non-stick surface that they were ruined.I highly recommend passing this appliance on to your waffle addicted child or they will never move out.I agree it is bulky, but not as hard to store as our Wok. This waffle iron will get used a whole lot more also. Yes, it is expensive, but when everyone raves about your perfect waffles, it is worth every penny and cheaper than going out 1-4 times for waffle breakfasts (subject to family size). Enjoy!"
3,"Good value for occasional use, but breaks under heavy repeated use","This waffle maker is a tremendous waffle maker if you are truly a casual waffle maker. By that I mean making waffles on special occasions, maybe a few times a year. It's the closest you will come to a commercial waffler at a reasonable price. But if you make waffles regularly, it is too lightly constructed to last for a long time. The hinge breaks after 500 waffles or so. I've had a number of other waffle makers, and this one most recently. I've been making waffles every saturday for the past 12 or so years. I bought one of these in 2004, and after two years of regular saturday use, the hinge broke. I promptly replaced it with the same one in 2006, and it broke this morning, like clockwork, two years after it was purchased, again in the same location on the hinge. I'm now shopping for a true commercial maker, because it's not economical to be buying one of these every two years..."
1,It Worked 3 Times and Then It Died,"We used this waffle maker 3 times and we loved it.Fresh waffles just like those in nice hotels etc.The 4th time it wouldn't heat up and we started searching for answers and realized that A LOT of people had the same problem.I would not recommend this product but I am not sure you have a lot of alternatives here so if you buy it, make sure you use it a lot before the 1 year mark in case you need to have it fixed. Otherwise you will get stuck with a cold waffle maker..."
2,Longevity is the problem,"Had been very satisfied with the performance of the unit, but it has died a bit prematurely in my opinion. The unit looks like it is built quite robustly, but after about a year and a half of weekend use the plastic anchors for the hinge screws failed. I had hoped to get much more use out of a small appliance like this, but it is not designed for a long life."
1,Broken after three times,"We loved the waffles while the maker lasted, which wasn't long! After using it only 3 times, I wanted to show it off to my daughters and it would not heat up AT ALL! There we sat with the waffle mix and lots of eager faces, only to be disappointed. Now it is a very expensive table ornament....completely useless. I'd like to know how I can get my money back. My advice to others is: look elsewhere!"
3,How to fix the waffle maker,My waffle maker also stopped heating. There is a thermal fuse under the stainless covers for the burners. It is covered by a white silicon tube. This part blows at the waffle maker stops heating. The part is about 1.50. That is what is failing on these things. If you search for thermal fuse 240C you will find them on amazon. I did not want to throw out such a nice waffle maker. You don't have to either.
3,Handle broke after using four times,No doubt this machine makes great waffles. We were surprised that what appears to be a very well built machine had such a weak handle-- ours snapped in two while lifting to remove a waffle after only four uses. If the handle were reinforced fully with metal rather than plastic this would be an incredible machine. Ours is going back today.
1,Great waffles - but units keep failing,"Great little waffle maker but I can't get them to last more than a few weeks. I'm now on number three. The last two failed in the same manner that everyone is reporting - unit powers on but hot plate stays cools. When they do work, they work very well and make great waffles. I contacted the company and they said that they will warranty the item by replacing it (they don't repair them) but they would not admit to what the problem was or if it had been resolved. In either case, even it fails after a few months, it's always easier to order a new one, then just send the old one back to Amazon in the new box. Hopefully I'll eventually get one that will stand the test of time."
1,"Good while it works, broke after using 2 times!","OK, if this waffle maker worked more than two times I would have loved it... I mixed my batter, turned it on- the power light went on, but no heat. The heating element fried in 2 uses! Looks beautiful, made perfect waffles 2 times, heating element is a piece of junk! Do not waste your money! Then, it was over the 30 day Amazon warranty, so I can not even return it. So I paid about $80 for 6 waffles. Could have gone to IHOP many times for that price."
1,Worked great three times then failed,I thought it was worth adding to the growing list of faulty units. Best waffle maker by far that I've ever used for the first three tries and then nothing. Luckily I bought it at a local store who accepted the return but I just can't recommend (or re-buy) until I hear they've fixed this issue. What a shame since it really did make terrific waffles.
4,Still a bit sticky,"''''''''''''''''Without proper amount of butter, the pot still ""stick"" the waffle."
5,BELGIAN WAFFLE MAKER,Awesome-Awesome-Awesome!! This is the best waffle maker I have ever owned. Anyone that likes waffles will LOVE this machine. It makes perfect waffles and is easy to use.
3,Nice Item ~ Lot more work than expected,"While I am happy with the item, I did not realize how much work it took to make Belgian Waffles. Convenience is always a key and this is definitely not that. I did not realize that Belgian waffles had to be made with yeast. After using the yeast, there was no warning of the batter growing over time. It actually doubled in size and made a huge mess in my fridge...not a fun way to spend Christmas morning. I wish the recipe manual that came with the item gave alternate, non-yeast, recipes. It also would have been nice to have some sort of warning of the growing batter."
2,made great waffles but......,This iron made great waffles but the arm that supports the front of the waffle iron broke in less than 6 months. I was very disappointed. I handle all my cooking equipment very carefully and feel the construction was not very good.
2,Broken after SECOND use!,"I REALLY wanted to like this waffle maker! I read all the reviews and despite a few reviews regarding the piece that breaks, I gave it a change. I shouldn't have.I just received this waffle maker yesterday. I made my first batch of waffles and I was IN LOVE. They were the best waffles I've had in a long time! Perfectly crisp on the outside and soft in the inside. The results were amazingly fluffy and yummy! Well, I made my second batch today and it the piece that holds the back part CRACKED! Just like the poor reviews! I'm so upset. I really loved the way it cooked waffles."
5,Top Notch Waffle Maker,"Overall, this product is a great and consistent waffle maker. We found some recipes are simple, clear and easy to follow, different from the ""included"" recipes that most requried yeast and additional prep time. The end result is my kids making waffles for breakfast every Saturday and Sunday morning.Some features that allow this to be a great product. 1) An audible alarm that lets everyone know the waffle is done, without having to open/close the lid to check. 2) The non-stick surface is exactly that, a non-stick surface!! 3) Easy clean up, nothing sticks, nothing to scrub. 4) Easy to follow recipes from most cookbooks, that don't call for weird or un-common items. 5) Great, consistent waffles that the cook is proud to serve to a hungry family!A great product, would recommend this to all."
3,"I used to love it, but...","...one day when I was putting it away i accidentally bumped the handle and the top plate broke off right where it connects to the handle. I was stunned! I finally got a phone number for Waring and called to see if I could purchase a new top plate, which didn't seem like such an unreasonable request as it's only held on by four screws. Or, failing that, I asked if it could be repaired. Admittedly, it was out of warranty, but the woman who answered the phone rather snottily told me I couldn't buy a new top plate, and the waffle maker couldn't be repaired. This seems ridiculous for an item that I paid over $100 for.I have another Belgian waffle maker that I got from Chef's Choice that cost about half of what this one cost, and it's both much older and it still works.I really like the ""flip"" style waffle maker as I feel it makes fluffier, more authentic belgian waffles. Unfortunately, mine broke."
1,Great until it falls apart,"I have been very happy with this waffle iron for the last three years until this morning. As soon as I flipped it over, it all but fell off the back hinge. The photo posted by another consumer is exactly what happened to me. The waffle still cooked perfectly, but I could see the wiring inside the unit! I'll try and post a picture to illustrate.If you are using one today, KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE BLACK PLASTIC that attaches the metal plates to the back post. This is where it falls apart. Like I said, I hadn't had any trouble with it until today."
1,Worked one time,"I got this as a Christmas gift. It made perfect waffles that morning and was very easy to clean up. Unfortunately, the next time I tried to turn it on, the light came on but no heat. I returned it to the store it was purchased from because my husband had the receipt. I will by a $10 one from Walmart like the one I had for 10 years! The quality ""look"" of this machine is deceiving."
2,Great Waffles while it worked :=(,I received this waffle maker in December and by February it had stopped heating up. The waffle maker was great until then. I plan on bringing it by the repair shop that Waring Customer Service told me about. I am having to go cold turkey until I get it fixed. I guess I got a lemon. :-(
5,Love this Waffle Maker,"I read alot of reviews on this particular waffle iron and since most were positive I decided to buy it. I am NOT disappointed! The recipes included, the ease of using it and the way the waffles come out..well they are wonderful. I would recommend this item to anyone who loves those big crisp thick waffles like I do. This was exactly what I was looking for!"
1,Disposable Waffle Iron,I bought this waffle iron because it was the closest I could find to the ones in the hotels where we stay. It worked great for about 8-10 waffles then it quit heating. I took it to the authorized repair center listed on the website and they told me this was not a repairable item. It is a disposable throwaway!It is cheaper to go to IHOP when you want waffles. Plus you don't have the mess in the kitchen.
3,"good waffles, but hard to clean.","i like the waffles this thing making, but it's very hard to clean and it takes out a lot of space on a counter."
1,Need to turn Off & On for a 'hot' iron.,"I really liked this Waring Pro waffle iron when I first got it, but it got old fast!.... the first several times I used it, it worked great... then it started going cold on me. In order to have a crispy hot waffle every time, I had to make the first waffle, then pull the plug, let it cool for a few minutes and then plug it in again in order to have it re-heat high enough for the 2nd, 3rd, 4th waffle, etc. I definitely did not use it for company!... After spending this much for a waffle iron, I did not expect it to start going bad after just a few months. I doubt that I will purchase any more of their products."
2,Worked great--for 2 months,I bought this on 11-11-07 and used it every weekend until this morning when I plugged the unit in and it didn't warm up. Now I have to either take it to a service center or scrap it and buy a new one. For $100 it ought to last a little longer than this.
1,Wish I had read the negative reviews . . .,I received this waffle maker about two weeks ago and after about 5 uses it broke--indicator light comes on but the unit doesn't heat up. I've noticed a lot of people having the same problem. You'd think they'd recall the things instead of selling them with faulty parts. I haven't tried to return it yet but hopefully I won't have any problems. It works beautifully . . . when it works. I guess it's worth the risk as you'll know within the first few times you use if it's going to break.
2,Waffle Maker Broken,"I read the reviews for this product on Amazon before purchasing and noticed that there were a couple comments regarding failure of the waffle maker. However I went ahead and purchased the unit in late October 2007. The first and second use produced great waffles. On our third use the waffle maker failed to heat. We got a total of 10 waffles out of this unit before it failed. Took it to a Waring authorized repair center today and the clerk advised that she had seen so many of these that she had the part number memorized, and advised that the circuit board fails. She also noted that Waring will be shipping us a new unit (under warranty); apparently they aren't worth fixing. Be aware of this design weakness before purchasing."
4,Great waffler!,"This waffle maker has been very, very good to me. It is a bit large for the countertop, but if you have the space, I recommend the WMK300. It is very easy to use and clean up when you finish. It comes with a stainless steel tray that can be washed separately. The rest of the waffle maker just wipes down - there is never a big mess. The no-stick surfaces work rather well but do not come out for cleaning. The dial on the front plate allows you to set the desired ""brown-ness"". It works well; I often change the setting during a waffle session and find that setting it to the same place gives the same result time after time.I have read other reviews about this waffle maker falling apart - mine hasn't after several dozen uses. This will not be a waffle maker that I will be handing down to my kids, it is not that durable, but I expect that it will last quite a few years."
1,If you enjoy returning things to the store buy this!,"My first Waring Pro worked for about 4 different amazing meals. I was simply in love with this waffle maker. Then it simply stopped working. The light comes on giving the baker false hope that she will once again be blessed by perfectly crisped waffles, but the burners don't heat up. We returned it to Macy's and the graciously gave us a new one. Unfortunately this one stopped working after only about 3 breakfasts. Save yourself the money and batter. DO NOT BUY THIS! Well, unless you enjoy returning things to the store."
2,Love at first...now she's left me,We now have joined the legions of folks who after a very short period of outstanding results are left with a product that does not work! It is a bit baffling to see such a trend go unaddressed by Waring. Hopefully the return policy at Amazon is as good as others have reported but it makes weary to think about returning it only to have the same issue with a replacement...
5,"Bought it, used it, love it...","I recently bought this not online, but at a local store. All I can say is that the waffles that I have made all have come out simply amazing. My three very picky young children all are eating the waffles that I make with this waffle maker. They usually don't care much for the frozen variety I buy at the store...but when I take this machine out, they all get excited, knowing that they are in for a treat. This would make a great gift, no doubt about it."
5,Love It!,"I love this waffle maker. I stayed at a hotel which had one as part of its continental breakfast and I fell in love with it. I researched and discovered there was one in ""household budget range"". I got it for Christmas and have no complaints. I use it every chance I get and it cleans very easy! I can't live without this appliance."
5,Our Third Waring Pro Waffle Maker Purchase!,"After research and reading about them , I requested and received (from husband) the Waring Pro WMK300 for a Christmas gift last year. My kids were so impressed with it when we made waffles while they were home that I, in turn, bought each of them one. Can't go wrong with it. Just like in the motel breakfast bars! We like the overnight waffle recipe in the booklet, crispy and light. Easy to use, it tells you when they are done, and easy to clean."
2,Waffle Iron,This iron is great if you like THICK cake like waffles. If you enjoy the thin nice and crisp waffle do not use this waffle iron.
1,"bogus company, but amazon refunds money","This company was not a real business, but I am happy to report that Amazon refunded my money and took care of the matter before I even consulted them. Thank you, Amazon. As I never actually received the product I cannot review it"
3,No as I had hoped.,"While in Belgium we actually had some Belgian waffles. They were as light as air and very good. I had hoped to duplicate them with the waffle iron. They furnish a recipe for them which is quite complicated but, if it worked, would be worth it. They suggest a setting of 4 for perfectly done waffles. On settings 4, 4 1/2 and 5 the waffle was still way too moist and somewhat raw on the inside. At 5 it was beginning to be too dark but still limp. I recheck to make sure I had added the ingredients accurately and found that I had. I think they should revisit their recipe and make the necessary corrections. It seemed like they were having you add a lot of water and whole milk. Prior to adding the beaten egg whites, the batter was very thin. After and hour with stirring in the whites every 15 minutes it thickened to a reasonable level. I suppose if you just want to make waffles, it would be okay. But if that is the case, you would be better to buy a cheaper waffle iron."
1,Not impressed at all,"After much research and reading of the numerous reviews, I decided to purchase this waffle maker for Christmas since it received overwhelming positive responses. Frankly, I am not impressed. I have yet to find a waffle maker that makes crisp waffles. I used the basic Belgian waffle recipe that comes with the machine, and it was way to soft. I followed the direction just as stated, and they came out very mushy. I then tried a store-bought brand, and the first one stuck to the waffle maker. What a mess that was to clean up. So I added more oil to the machine (even though it says you only need to do that once when you first use the machine), and the waffle came out okay, but not crispy as desired.Anyway, I am not impressed with it. In my humble opinion, a less expensive one might do much better. I sure regret spending over $80.00 for this piece of mess. We live and learn."
5,Finally...,"We just purchased the WWM200 model (no different as far as I can tell) from Costco for $50. After wrestling with our previous wafflemaker, this one is a dream come true. We used it for the first time this morning and experienced efficiently baked, golden-brown belgian waffles pour after pour. Now I look forward to making them..."
5,Can't be Beat!!,"This waffle maker is an outstanding value! It's so attractive and well-made that I'm keeping it on permanent display on my countertop.Most importantly, it works perfectly. This is the first waffle maker I've owned that requires no guesswork! Having the audible beep to let you know the waffle is done is SO helpful to me because I'm usually doing 100 other things in the kitchen at the same time. I set the temperature control to #4 as suggested, and the waffles were perfectly done when the alarm went off. No peaking and guessing like other makers I've owned.I had been toying with the idea of buying the Kitchenaid, but it seemed so extravagent. Kudos to Waring for offering a well-designed, quality product with a reasonable price tag!!"
1,will not last long,thermal fuse will blow after 15 or so uses. replacement part 526-nte8242 available from mouser electronics $1.50 plus shipping. fuse is in fixed plate inside plastic tube. easy repair cut out old fuse clamp in new one with plyers. do not soider fuse comes with 2 new crush clamps
4,A great device to own if you love waffles,"I bought mine at Bed, Bath & Beyond since I had a 20% off coupon - thereby making my purchase $64. No tax either since I bought it in Delaware.At any rate, I bought Golden Malted waffle flour to make my waffles and boy am I pleased. They taste delicious...a perfect golden brown color (on setting 4), a crispy exterior, soft & fluffy interior...you can't ask for a better waffle. I'm just sorry I didn't have any homemade whipped cream to put on top!I recommend this waffle iron. If you follow the directions (which are quite easy), you shouldn't have any problems. I just found that I had to fill the little measuring cup above the fill line to get a waffle that adequately filled the grates of the iron.I also like the professional style of this iron...I feel like a real chef!"
1,Simply unacceptable,"I bought two of these Wafflemakers, the first one stopped heating after a couple of weeks, Amazon quickly replaced it with one that shorted and blew the breaker in my kitchen. it was also only a couple of weeks old. Amazing that dangerous and faulty junk like this goes into production."
1,Joy turns to frustration,"Bought for my wife and she loved it until last week when it refused to heat up (as you will read in many other reviews). Went to a lot of effort and work to replace fuse. Plugged it in and it heated up; poured in the batter and turned it over. Zap, sparks flew and it is dead again, NEVER to be resurrected. Our son has one also, which is still making him delicious waffles, but we will not risk buying this brand again."
3,"Good, but watch out for durability issues!","I loved using this waffle maker, but I have gone through 3 of them now, and am looking for an alternative! The first one blew a heating element after about a year (just out of warranty) and the others had the plastic mechanism at the rear hinge wear out, due to exposure to oil. (Although it is non-stick, it still required a spray of cooking oil now and then). The model is just for casual home use, and could not stand up to the very heavy use the waffle-lover in me demanded! While shopping around, I noticed there is a nearly identical commercial (WW 150), with all-metal construction, that sells for $220-$275! If you can avoid getting oil on the area where the screws attach the swivel mechanism, I could recommend it."
2,A Marvel: excellent when working right; a sparking fuseblower when moody,"This is a marvelous machine when functioning according to design. Others have reviewed its positive features. And others have reviewed its downfall: a short in the wiring when flipping. On this iron's fifth outing since purchase, the little woman of the house exclaimed loudly when on the second waffle, a flash emitted from between the two plates, and the kitchen circuit breaker popped. Doesn't always happen, though, and after several circuit resets, she managed to finish up the batter. Waring telephone customer service responded within two days with an offer to replace it with currently made model, the one with folding handle. Waring also issued a UPS call tag to reclaim the sparky unit for examination. We'll see if the 'Toyota fix' has been applied to the waffle iron that is being sent as replacement."
1,Waffle Iron stops working after 10 uses,"The Waring ""Pro"" Belgian Waffle Maker is a piece of garbage. I am on my second one, and like the first one, the waffle maker stopped cooking waffles. The first one died after about 5-6 uses. I then returned (didn't buy it from Amazon) and tried another one out. The second one last about 7-8 uses, and then crapped out again. I heard the heating element goes bad in this model, and supposedly you can buy a fuse [...]. I will probably just go to the store, buy a new one, and return this old one. I with Waring would remedy this issue, since it seems like everybody that owns this product has had issues with it. I would definitely not recommend this product, unless you like paying $80 for 10 waffles."
1,ruined thanksgiving breakfast,"i used this waffle maker twice and it worked fine. thanksgiving morning i had about 12 people for a waffle breakfast and after making 3 waffles it stopped heating and left me without waffles to serve, so my guests had ham sandwitches for breakfast. thanks waring."
5,"Yeah, waffles!","This thing is great! It's definitely commercial quality. If you've ever made yourself a waffle at the Residence Inn's buffet breakfast, then you've had a preview of how well this device works. It doesn't stick, it cooks to perfection, and it's easy to clean. Our only problem is that we can't find a waffle mix that tastes as good as the Residence Inn waffles!"
1,Mine was defective,"I had high hopes for this waffle maker, but mine was defective and needed to be returned. Sometimes after flipping, it was next to impossible to flip it back. I needed to release a locking pin with a screwdriver. The return to Amazon was painless. I decided to replace it with a Hamilton-Beach Flip 'n Fluff(26200). The Flip 'nFluff turned out to be great! I paid only $17 and it made better waffles than the Waring Pro."
5,"lightweight and unintimidating despite being a ""Pro""","I was worried about size and heft but this is a very light machine despite its metallic looks. I just hope sturdiness wasn't sacrificed in order to make this affordable. Well, this is my true indulgence purchase. I didn't splurge on a santoku or an electric carving knife, but I felt a strong urge to buy this and have that luxury of making waffles at home. How decadent to have a designated machine for this treat! It was a breeze. I was really worried I would have terrible results. However, nothing burned and the waffle just peeled right off in one big piece. I like the setting option to make darker crispier waffles and will be experimenting with savoury brown rice flour and egg white waffles with scallions soon. Now that I own one, I understand why owners use it so frequently. On the road to pudgier are we."
3,Great but no gold star,"After three years of low use, but, excellent service the unit failed. On disassemble it was discovered that the circuit card in conjunction with the heat sensor was faulty. Apparently the circuit control components were just not up to the job.Several reviews stated that they believed it was the elements. The elements were still rock solid (yes they were tested) and very capable of delivering a long life.I gave this three stars because of the low quality control circuit and a big disappointment on the limited replacement parts offered by Waring Pro.I placed our faulty unit in the capable hands of our area sanitation personnel.I will replace this unit with a competitors unit with fewer failures."
2,"waring waffle maker, WMK300","I am on my 3rd one. after sitting in my storage unit for 2 years I got it out and fired it up. Worked great the 4 times I used it. then like the other 3, it just stopped working (heating up). While it worked it made awesome waffles, I used the Krustz brand waffle mix and if you follow the directions it makes killer waffles. So in conclusion I can't say I recommned this product since 3 out of 3 times it has taken a dump on me. and all this time I though waring products were top of the line! Oh well, live and learn. but never again.Rudy RuizRSM, CA"
2,Worked great . . .the stopped!,"Made great waffles for 1 year, then beeper wouldn't work and it stopped heating! We had a house full of hungy people . . on the fifth waffle .. nothing! We probably only used this waffle maker 8 times in the year we had it . .so it didn't malfunction due to overuse or abuse. Very dissappointed."
5,Easy to use,"Very easy to use and makes great waffles. It takes away the ""fear"" of making waffles, which I hadn't attempted in years following disastrous attempts with an older iron. It is easy to clean. Although you aren't supposed to wash the grids themselves, it comes so clean that you really don't have to (unlike my old iron that seemed to hold on to parts with an ""iron grip""). I also like that it beeps to tell me when the waffle is done.Great for using with the Golden waffle mix. Golden Malted Pancake & Waffle Flour, Original, 16-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)Several people who have seen me use this were amazed at its ease and low price for such an expensive looking item and have gone out and bought their own."
1,Great for the brief time it worked,"We had this maker for 2 months and used it maybe every other weekend. The waffles were delicious. Last weekend, in the middle of making waffles, it just stopped working. It wouldn't heat up anymore. Thankfully, I still had my receipt and the store where I purchased it took it back. Not sure what to buy now. Really loved those Belgian waffles!"
2,Excellent waffles but short life,"I received this unit as a Christmas gift from my daughter 18 months ago, and our family loved the waffles. I also liked the ease of use and consistent results. This week, it just stopped heating in the middle of making a waffle. As it was out of warranty, I took it apart to see what was wrong and this thing is a repairman's nightmare! I had power to the element wires, but no heat. I expected some sort of a brush mechanism for conducting electricity through the rotation, but the wires just twist back and forth and I suspect they finally worked hard and broke. After reading the numerous reviews with the exact same problem, it seems I got more out of mine than most people so instead of replacing it with the same model, I will be doing some research for a better waffle maker."
5,"Love, Love, Love this waffle maker....","I have a little girl who loves Trader Joes waffles and they have been repackaging due to the new trans fats regulations. They are an all natural multigrain waffle and she just loves them. Well, after waiting for these waffles for over 3 months now and not being able to find another decent frozen waffle, we decided to buy the waffle maker. We received this today and within a half an hour, I had the waffle maker out, the manual red, and perfect waffles in my daughters mouth. Needless to say,we are all very happy:-) Effortless...Impressive....Perfect..."
3,Lasted 4.5 years but served our waistlines well.,"Cons:I gave this as a gift in December of 2007 and it recently died (summer 2012). Assuming it was used once per month, it lasted about 50-60 uses.Pros:It worked well while it lasted and made nice, even waffles and the recipient did enjoy it.Overall:I expected it to last longer for $79.95. I'm replacing it as a gift but won't be buying the same model - I'll probably look for one in a slightly higher price range with a better review, or at least more ""industrial"" design."
3,"Love it, when it works!","I got this waffle maker as a wedding gift and was very excited to try it out! I used it a few times in our first year of marriage and then it completely pooped out on me! There must have been a short. THANK GOD that it was within the first year so it was covered by the warranty. Or else I wouldn't have gotten a new one for free! I did have to go through the hassle of mailing it in and all that, but it worked out & I did get a brand new one in the mail. Since then we've made waffles a LOT! I actually use it way more than I even thought. Only issue now is that sometimes the beeping that lets you know when the waffles are done doesn't work! It's very random, so I just have to watch them! It works more often than not I'd say, but kind of annoying, Overall, when the product works, I love it!"
1,An all-around bad deal,"First of all the beep tone when ready didn't work. Then the thing did a poor job of cooking when following the directions. Third, I couldn't find any way to return the damn thing either inside the shipping box or on line; so I just kept it. I've finally figured out that if I just use my stop watch and let things cook about two minutes it will produce a reasonable end product. All in all it's a losing proposition and I sure wouldn't buy it on line again because once you have it YOU'RE STUCK WITH IT!"
2,Good waffles while it lasts,"I've had it 18 months and used it sparingly, but with great delight, until yesterday. It made one good waffle; the second one burned because the timer didn't go off, and then it stopped heating. Appears to be the heating element. It's probably only been used 15-18 times."
1,Waring Pro WMK300 Belgian Waffle Maker,"We've tried 3 of these waffle makers since Jan 08. Each one made tasty waffles at the start, only to quit heating sufficiently after making less than 20 waffles. It is unfortunate, since if the durability was better it would be a very good product except for its size.My husband insisted on trying a third time because he so liked the waffles. Not again. Three times and its out!"
2,"Great waffles, low quality reliability","This thing is fun to use and makes great waffles. Sadly, I used mine twice with no problems, on the third time the heating element stopped working after the third waffle. I'm not impressed with the quality of the device at all. We'll go trade it in and get ANOTHER receipt, and from the survey of these comments, save that receipt to replace it in a month or so when that one breaks, and so on..."
1,Don't bother,This thing looks like a quality piece and it does make great waffles. But the first one Amazon sent me failed after about a dozen waffles. The heating element just quit heating up. Amazon sent me a second one and it did exactly the same thing. Only thing is I wasn't making waffles that often so it is out of warranty. Not sure if it is the element itself or a ciruit card. Doesn't really matter since you can't get either part. Yet another piece of junk going to the landfill.
2,Died after one month of use,"It worked pretty well when we first got it, though sometimes the timer would forget to go off. :-) After about a month, it would turn off internally after a while and the waffles wouldn't get cooked. But the light stays on. Yesterday, I could turn it on but it wouldn't heat up at all.The plastic on the unit is also a little flimsy.Bottom line: time to try the Kitchenaid $200 model which appears to be built like a tank."
5,Fabulous Waffles!!,"Not only is this easy to work with, but it makes perfect waffles every time. Simple, easy and delicious!!"
1,Expected It To Last,"Bought this iron based on so many positive reviews about how nicely it cooks. Had it delivered to my son in college, since he loves waffles so much. He had friends over to breakfast. It worked on and off for a bit, about an hour, and then stopped working entirely. Somehow, more is expected of an appliance that's so popular and well reviewed and comparatively expensive. He said it made nice waffles until it broke."
1,ME...,"I ordered the all great and wonderful WMK300 Belgian Waffle maker. But Amazon Sent wrong product, but swore and proclaimed they were right noway can they be wrong. Oh Oh they were wrong. But instead of fixing the misorder, they tried to accuse me of not knowing what I ordered. So instead of a wonderful Christmas day. It was just another cheap look alike. They tried to buy me off. But really, are you kidding. Amazon the real meaning of Christmas. CHEAPER IS ALLWAYS THE BEST ALTERNATE. Advise, save your money. order your products somewhere else."
5,If you like waffles this is a must,I received a gift certificate to Bed Bath and Beyond and decided I wanted a new waffle maker. I told my husband this was the machine he would have wanted and I would have talked him out of it. Who needs a restaurant quality waffle maker? Thank goodness I had a lapse of good sense. I love this machine. I tried the timely recipes included with the waffle maker and have decided the package Belgian waffle mix is just as good in a shorter amount of time. My grandchildren and I eat the cold ones for snacks throughout the day.The only problem I see with this appliance is that I am going to gain wieght.
2,Great waffles! died too soon,I purchased this Belgian waffle maker 3/3/08. I was VERY pleased with it at first . It made wonderful waffles and I loved everything about it. I have used it maybe 4 times. Today it stopped heating. I was making breakfast and the 5th waffle never got 'done'. Evidently some heating element malfunctioned (?) For the $$$ it should have lasted over a month!!!!
4,"Very pleased with this waffle maker,,,,","I have had this waffle iron for about a year. Overall, I am very pleased with its performance. On occasion, I have had a bit of a sticking problem, and found that I got better results using ghee (clarified butter) rather than oil on the cooking surfaces.Anyone buying this item also needs to be aware of the problems that can be created by using cooking sprays. Unless you want to ruin an otherwise great appliance, DO NOT USE COOKING SPRAY ON YOUR WAFFLE IRON. The lecithin in cooking sprays will burn from the heat of the waffle iron and leave a sticky residue on the surface, eventually causing the failure of the non-stick feature."
1,Not Built to Last,"The first one came, and it worked three times before the heating element stopped work. We sent it back, and the second one worked twice before the heating element stopped working.This seems to be a problem with all belgian waffle irons in all price ranges. Just read the reviews on other brands, and you'll see what I mean. That's too bad, too. It shouldn't be that difficult to make a belgian waffle iron that can last for more than three uses. Who ever heard of a ""disposable"" waffle maker?"
5,Worth it.,"I was trying to justify spending a lot of money on a professional belgain waffle maker when I came across this machine about 6 months ago and decided to give it a try. I ordered one and love it. I've had several people over for Sunday brunch and they each ordered a like machine of their own.The recipe calls for yeast so unless you use the overnight directions it does take an hour for the batter to be ready to use. If I am making brunch I usually start this immediately. By the time I'm done with the coffee, getting the paper, cutting fruit or whatever its usually just about an hour. Really, who can't figure out a way to putter away time on a Sunday morning?Another great plus is that unlike regular waffles, these waffles freeze beautifuly so my husband has breakfast for a few days of the week.Having read previous reviews I have made an effort to be careful with the handle and followed the seasoning directions. I have had no sticking issues and so far so good with the handle."
1,Waring wmk300 waffle maker,"This unit does make very good waffles. My wife and I purchased 4 of them and gave them out as gifts to our children. We own our unit for about 2 years and have used it maybe 10 times. We attempted to use it recently but the unit would not get hot, and we could not make waffles. I have tried several times to get it going again but it does not get hot.I tried to find a service center and was told that it would probably cost $98 for just walking in the door and an additional $93 per hour to look and fix.Had it not been for this problem I would have rated this a 5 star item. I don't think this unit should have become unusable within such a short period of time and use.Frank...Rockville, Md."
5,Wonderful Waffler,"After losing my old General Electric waffle maker in the divorce (a 50's model still churning out great waffles, sob) I was looking for a replacement waffler. After reading several other reviews on traditional waffle makers I saw the review on this one and thought I'd give it a chance and was floored. It's all they said and more. I actually had to turn it over to see that it was made in China not USA. I don't think this thing can make a bad waffle. Even the first one (batter was too thick and I missed the beep) which stayed in way too long was good!"
1,DO NOT BUY this piece of junk,"I received this as a Christmas present (it was purchased from Amazon) and after less then 3 weeks of use ,it is dead ,and will not heat up.when it worked it was excellent but if you Google this waffle iron (i wish i had) you will see that many people are having problems with it dying after just a short period of time.even worse ,when they are sent a new one ,it doesn't last either.this is not a cheap waffle iron ,but since my friend purchased it back in November ,Amazon will not even take it back and i am going to have to return it to Waring.Save yourself the trouble ,BUY SOMETHING ELSE !"
2,"Great Waffles, not so great machine...","The waffles this machine cranks out are wonderful! When it works. I've read many reviews about problems with the heating element stopping after a certain amount of uses and I thought I'd take the risk. I too had the same problem not more than 2 months after owning the iron. I ordered another one as a replacement, which I must say Amazon was wonderful about, and the new one also had problems. The new iron's timer didn't work and the lights and alarm went off intermitently. I'm pretty dissapointed because we were really looking forward to a great waffle maker!"
1,It just broke or exploded - no longer works,"Length:: 1:34 MinsI really enjoyed this waffle maker every day until it broke suddenly and without warning. We'd used it almost every weekend to feed our family of 4 a tasty waffle breakfast It makes good waffles, but the design we discovered, sadly, was terribly flawed. Waring owes us a repair kit in my mind - it's sad to see a useful device stop working for no logical reason."
2,"Great waffles, electrical problems","Makes excellent waffles (turned up all the way), but after only 3 months it's starting to trip my GFCI breaker. I read one other review about melted wires, so I'm going to rip into mine real soon.I'm concerned about this product's durability. I have to admit I was a bit skeptical when similar products go for 3 times this price. Oh well, ygwypf."
5,Defunct,"2008 ADDENDUM: We loved it for less than a year and just like other subsequent reviewers have described- it would not heat up. The light was on but no READY. What a waste, so sad. Can't change the star rating in editing this review but I would only give it 2 stars now. 9-2007 After having waffles at a hotel continental breakfast we wanted to continue to enjoy them with our family. Went looking on Amazon for what was available and what the reviews were. Spotted this model as being similar to the hotel waffle maker and after reading the basically positive reviews went ahead and ordered. As a family we have tremendously enjoyed the finished product from this waffle maker after church on Sunday since we received it. It is so easy to use and so quick. No regrets on our part. And worth finding an easily accessible storage place for it! Have only used Carbons Golden Malted Waffle mix available from Amazon. Also, measuring cup is hid on underside of packing styrofoam so watch for it."
1,Expensive for # of times you get to use it,I don't think that I used this a dozen times and pff--it stopped working right in the middle of making waffles. That makes the waffles I did manage to make darn expensive. I was extremely disappointed that this was not made to last. I guess it will be back to pancakes.
3,interesting but unbelievable to me,"Three stories related at the same time to each other. Gets a little complicated as the story line can change line after line. If I didn't read a review of this fiction, it would have driven me crazy! Knowing in advance how it would read gave the book a little pizzazz.Some scenarios were believable, some not.Without giving away the plot; the goings on in the Kommadants office were weird to say the least."
2,"Nay, would not recommend","AMAZON BOOK REVIEWS5 STARS=Writing, Page Turner, Character Building, Believable and Plot(I loved it, highly recommend it and will read again)4 STARS=Page Turner, Character Building, Believable and Plot(I loved it and highly recommend it)3 STARS=Character Building, Believable and Plot(I really liked and would recommend it)2 STARS=Believable and Plot(Nay, would not recommend)1 STARS=Even the plot isn't worth it(Iskabibble, I could not finish it)There is enough Non-Fiction stories that are more real, I felt I was wasting my time with this and couldn't finish."
1,Terrible - a waste of time,Don't bother. Switches from past to present over and over from one paragraph to the next. The mistress is someone you never get to know. Characterization is very poor. The ending in confusing. One of the worst books I ever read. I want a refund !!!
1,CONFUSING,"I have not finished the book yet but I can say it is the most confusing of any book I have ever read. The author switches scenes so quickly and you can read one sentence to the next and nothing makes sense. In one instance he is playing with his daughter and the next sentence yelling at his adjutant. You wonder how he goes from home, hotel and death camp within the same paragraph. I am still attempting to read it but it would be nice if she had written one chapter about home, the next about hotel, then work something to have made it flow better. Its as if the author has a serious case of ADD."
5,Thank you,Thank you for a novel that expresses the reality and fright of such a horrible time in the history of the world.
5,6 Stars! Amazing Must Read,I found that the style in which this book was written to be amazing. I can only imagine that the author's intention was to immerse the reader into the torent of emotions she was pouring onto the page. It was as if I was assaulted from every side by the raw anger and feelings this story evoked. I will address formatting issues I encountered~none. There is no doubt in my mind as to why The New York Times found this as one of their Top 100 books. This is a must read.
1,Dreadful editing,Luckily I purchased this book for free. Normally I don't give reviews for mediocre books but the editing of this book so was bad that it needed to be addressed. The story may have been good but the editing so bad that I couldn't get past the second chapter. Please have someone edit this book if you want someone to read it. This book had the abolute worse paragraphing that I have come across. This was a real problem when the author went on to another scene/subject but forgot to finish the first. Whomever wrote the first review must not have had the same edition that I received.
1,Too hard to follow,"I read part of this & ended up deleting it because it transitioned too quickly between time periods. If this is progressive writing, I'll stick to old-fashioned, where you don't need to re-read one page 10 times and still not know if you are getting the story right in my mind."
2,Interesting style of writing,"It's hard to get into this book. It goes back and forth from past to present from one moment to the next. Sometimes it's very hard to follow. While the content might be very good, it's very difficult to know which situation you are reading about. Some might call it progressive. I think it's just a rambling of thoughts all jumbled up. I'm glad I got it for free. I would have hated to have paid for it."
4,Fascinating and heartwrenching,"I loved this novel. It was written in a different fashion with various 'scenes' mixed together, one leading to another, but I enjoyed it after I got used to the writing style. It is the story of the commandant of a concentration camp and the beautiful young Jewish woman he made his mistress.The novel was written in three parts: the first part was written from the Kommandant's perspective; the second part was written in thel Jewish woman's perspective; and the third part was their obituaries.In addition to 'Those Who Save Us' by Jenna Blum, this is one of my favorite works of fiction concerning the Third Reich."
3,Mistress she was!,"I read this as a book club choice, and I liked it okay, but was disgusted with a lot of it. I felt like she could have done more with her life and been a bit more manipulative with the commandant. She was more helpless than what I felt like she could have been. Interesting read, but not my favorite."
3,"""Interesting"" book",Was not thrilled with the way it time shifted all the way through the book. Made it hard to follow.
2,confusing,"One of the most confusing books I have ever read, I acknowledge the authors way of telling the story however the way the story jumps from one part of the story in time to another left me confused. Would not bother to purchase this one"
5,Baby Blues 2,"Yep, just like it was when raising kids. Only I didn't see the humor in it then. Now that I have grandkids, I see them all through the book. Love reading the books and sending clips to my kids."
2,Neat looking but very weak,"This is definitely for display purposes only. It's a nice looking replica and something that you can kind play reel a little. But it is not meant to bend. The rod is a lot more delicate than I thought it would be. My two year old managed to snap it into 5 pieces about 20 minutes after opening it. So if youre looking for a small usable type of rod, this isnt it. If youre looking for something that is just going to sit in a stand on your desk then this will probably do the job. Personally, for 20 bucks I could have just gone and gotten him an actual combo rod & reel, so for my money Id have to say it wasnt worth it."
3,OVERALL ERFORMANCE,"Beautiful watch. Aestethic design. Ergonomic nightmare, quite difficult to try and set/adjust the time and all other functions the watch can pefrorm, even with online step by step movie!"
5,Documentary is superb!,"This documentary is great for anyone who is curious about this religion. A great eye-opener about Mormonism. Watch it, because it is told (produced, directed, written) from the former Mormon perspective. A work of art!"
1,It's remarkable that this video is supposed to be christian.,"I was given this video over a year ago. I have been fascinated by Anti-Mormon Propaganda for years now. This video makes many claims trying to support their idea that the Book of Abraham that was translated by Joseph Smith is false. I don't suggest watching the movie but if you do, put fourth the effort to research what happened to the papyrus. Ask yourself the question why not just show the meaning of everything instead of the few things they point out. Nothing in the video directly contradicts any part that Joseph Smith said he translated. Don't be decieved by this trash."
1,I do not agree....,"I'm reading quite a number of comments which are not positive on the LDS faith. This is good. Hopefully it will entice people here to do some real homework. This video isn't a documentary by qualified professionals despite the format it's presented in. I've been creating my own DVD's for years and could come up with something like this and not be factual. A reviewer here wrote the following:'I find it amazing that a church that refers to potential new converts as ""investigators"" insists that people stop investigating as soon as they hit the baptismal water.'If that's the case then I'm in a lot of trouble :-) I haven't stopped yet. Yes there are questions about the LDS church. Did you know there are questions about EVERY church out there? This is the part in which faith is brought up. I'm afraid the answer to questions (even the Book of Abraham) will NOT be found in something as simple as a DVD."
3,Oh it's a good movie,"Sure it's a good movie. You can make anything seem plausible.That's why reason doesn't always do the job. It's unreasonable that Christ was resurrected, it's unreasonable that Moses parted the red sea. It's unreasonable that the world was created by a god. It's unreasonable that we go anywhere after death. There's no proof of any of it, and therefore it's open to debate and vulnerable to attack. Anyone could take the Book of Abraham, or the Bible or the Koran and ""disprove"" it's origins or it's meaning. For that matter philosophers and physicists are constantly ""disproving"" subject matters, and theorems. But does that necessarily make them untrue?This movie does a good job of what it was designed for, but it doesn't change my feelings on the matter. The only thing that could do that is myself."
1,Ever heard of the 10 commandments?,"Everytime a product like this hits the market, I ask myself: ""Are the people making this christians? Do they actually believe in God?"" If they do, obviously, they must believe in the 10 commandments! So what happened to ""You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor""? I guess their quest to combat ""evil"" exempts them from their own rules? The end justifies the means?Well, it doesn't. Truly a sorry product!"
1,Whatever,Well it seems i have come to a place where everyone who has written a review feels really good about themselves. This movie is crap and for all you people who feel good about yourselves for having nothing better to do than make fun of peoples religions. This movie was designed to convince weak minded people that the LDS church is a bunch of lies and it seems to have succeeded with the people writing these reviews. i would tell you to review your values and try reading the Book of Mormon and not just go by people who have something against this church and find out for yourselves.
1,Old Stuff,"This video repackages old arguments. It is nothing new. Nor is it fair and balanced as they claim. All arguments come from the naysayers. If you want to be informed about the Book of Abraham, this video is not the place to start or stop."
1,Great Piece of Art,The truth has been distorted in this DVD. The makers of this DVD claim the Book of Abraham is a great piece of art. The DVD is a GREATER PIECE OF ART. The Devil will tell you a 1000 truths to get you to believe 1 lie. They take a lot of things which are true and skew it towards their beliefs so that you are left to believe only that which is false.
3,These Forgotten Famous Guys!,"More famous for his politics and controversy than his music, Robinson is rightly forgotten. It may be admirable to be openly gay but it doesn't make the music any better."
4,laird cregar and eddie muller.must see,"Well worth the money for the excellent Muller commentary. His good natured enjoyment of the pic, his personality, and the wealth of info he has add a lot. I would not have known the Cregar character was a portrait of writer Cornell Woolrich by his friend Fisher.(In the book only, the character was very thin and corpselike.) I also might not have noticed the Black Mask mag in the newstand scene. Cregar is really outstanding and extra creepy but also touching. Terrific. Nice bonus features include a singing scene with Grable and a horny boss. Fox has done a nice job with their noir series."
3,"Cheesy, Average, Dark Mystery","""I Wake Up Screaming"" was made in 1941, starring Betty Grable, Carole Landis, Victor Mature, and a vulture-like detective played by Laird Cregar. It turned out to be not that scary, and though a mystery - it played more like a standard 40's romance film. The background music for most of the scenes was ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" - Huh? Anyway there was a twist at the end of the movie, and the stand out performance was by Laird Cregar as the hound dog detective Ed Cornell. He has the secret in his heart.Not a bad 40's film, but not that great either. The plot set-up seemed a bit cheesy."
3,Somewhere Over The Rainbow ?!,"This is entertaining Film Noir. There are many good reviews written here that will tell you all about it. I just wanted to add: for some reason, instrumental versions of the famous ""Wizard of Oz"" song ""Somewhere are Over The Rainbow"" are heard about 20 times during this movie! Does anyone out there know the story behind That ? ?"
3,awful music,"Following my film noir search I have to admit I really enjoy this movie, I only regret listening as love theme the main theme from Over The Rainbow by Harold Arlen. Very interesting collection this Fox Film Noir, 5 new other titles are on the way."
5,Classic Noir,"What struck me about ""I Wake Up Screaming"" was how it tackled provocative themes in the Production Code era most prominently psychotic obsession. It's distinguished by great writing and excellent acting. The performance that stands out in my mind is the one delivered by Laird Cregar, a detective who dogs Victor Mature's talent promoter for the murder of a model that he groomed for success. It's the kind of turn that stands out among the great supporting roles of film noir. The film strikes the requisite mood and the soundtrack sports a variation of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" that is used to good effect."
3,I Wake Up Squinting,"No one wakes up screaming in this feature, though it's a wonder, given the way the characters show up in each other's darkened apartments! A good deal of the action, as well as the dialogue, appears to be utterly fantastic--so it seems appropriate that Grable's presence is often accompanied by strains of ""Over the Rainbow"". Such incredibility does lend to the unpredictability of the plot-line, though, so the movie can be enjoyable if one doesn't think about it too deeply. It's also fun to watch Grable in a film noir--and amusing to see how a swimsuit scene is worked into the story!"
5,the best live performance,"I've seen this talented duo in concert and they were amazing! Between my 30 year old sister and I (Only 15 years of age) we have enough stories about their concert to last a lifetime! Their cd is just a simple reminder of that night! I can't wait until their next album. In the meantime, listen to their first cd~it's amazing!"
3,Great,"I love this CD! ""Truly Madly Deeply"" is my favorite song on the album. On the other hand, I don't like like any of the other songs. They seem depressing to me."
4,This song is a good song full of imagination.,"I don't listen to Savage Garden that much, but this song caught my ear. It is a wonderful song."
5,Truly Madly Deeply is my favourite song,i am from europe.I like songs of Darren Hayes. But I can't find casset or CD of Darren Hayes. its really hard to find any music of Darren Hayes.Please help me if you can. Thank you.
2,Not for Beginners,"This was the required text for an intro course that I took. This book is definitely not for beginners. It is too wordy which makes it difficult to understand. If you're a Political Science professor, for the love of God do not give this book to your students."
5,"An Absolute ""Must"" for the Yorkie lover!",Joan has done an outstanding job with this book. This book is written for the Yorkie lover in mind. Joan's expertise from years of experience is absolutely priceless. This book is written for both the pet lover and the show lover in mind. This book is extremely informative and an absolute must to own!
3,Great Protection but Doesn't Come Off,"This product is a great sunblock for water sports. It provides great protection, is waterproof, and lasts a long time... a bit too long, in my opinion. After two showers and lots of scrubbing, I still can't seem to get the product off my skin. It's not a pleasant feeling, and it shouldn't be this difficult to remove."
2,there's better options,"I've had a silicone case on my Treo 650 for a long time. It was thin and the rubber was very grippy (great anti-slip)- once I left my Treo on top of my car (NOT recommended) and drove 10 miles, and the case was so grippy that the phone was still on top when I arrived! After it finally broke I ordered this one to replace it. The rubber on the Boxwave case is much thicker than my original case, so much so that it's difficult to use the 5-way navigator without it doing what I didn't want it to do. The case is not nearly as grippy and slides off my car seat, unlike the original. Boxwave offers full refunds if the product is defecive- since this isn't, I probably won't bother. But in my opinion, there's better products out there."
2,Birds not nearly as interested in this food as in prior suet purchases.,"When I saw this product on Amazon I was quite excited by the price and quantity, as the birds in my yard had been eating about 1/2 a package of suet a day. When this suet arrived, it appeared to have far fewer seeds than the brand I had been using and this product was an ounce or two less per pack. Oh well, I thought, if the birds like it, it is fine with me. Unfortunately I now have 18 of these and the first two are only partially eaten after a week or more.Now it is possible that the unusually cold weather has driven the birds south for warmer weather, but I still see plenty of birds in the yard, but far fewer are eating from the suet feeders. It is also possible that this mix is not suited for the birds that live here this time of year. My advice is that if you have a brand that has been working well for you, stick with it. If not, buy fewer than 20 packages until you are sure that the birds in your area like this food."
5,Nothing better in the suet world!,"I've had some trouble attracting birds to suet feeders in the past but I got a single cake of this kind of suet for Christmas and the birds GO NUTS over it! I was nearly out of that cake and I knew I had to find suet on line but I was concerned about finding one that the birds would like as much as my ""magic cake"". But I easily found this 16 pack of the same kind of suet and I jumped at the bit to get it! Today the full case of 16 arrived and the birds were on it within 5 minutes of me loading the suet feeder!Good price, birds love it, NOTHING BETTER IN THE SUET WORLD!"
3,Wrong time of year for this.,"I didn't read the label right. It's for song birds, which come winter and snow they are not here. It'll be great in the spring. The birds do eat it but not much."
3,Maybe a Bit Too Fancy,"These suet cakes contain a lot of seed and corn products that attract a broader range of birds than other suet cakes I have used. While that sounds good, not all of the birds that are coming to the feeder are the ones I would like - I have plenty of starlings and sparrows now. I do, however, still get the downy woodpeckers and other traditional suet eaters that I am trying to attract, so it's not all bad. However, next time I think I will stick with a more basic suet cake."
3,Bird Suet,The price was good and the offer of ordering numberous cakes. My birds don't seem to go for it except for the Downy woodpecker.
5,New species of birds have been attracted to our feeders,"I bought two cases of this products. They're easy to open and use in our feeders. We've feed the birds for 5 years and this is the first time we have used this mfgr's suet cakes. Happily we have 4 new species of little itty bitty (about the size of a small finch) beautifully colored birds eating at our feeders. We live in Vancouver, WA. I don't know what the difference is between locally sold suet and this product but we will continue to use the suet from Amazon.com."
4,The Birds Love Them,These are a nice buy and easy to use with amazon.com's C&S Easy Fill Bottom suet feeder (only $12). Try it! Both you and the birds will enjoy it.
1,tiny cakes,"These are super thin, maybe 25% smaller in size than most others brands. 9.25 oz compared to 11.8 oz for other brands I have right now."
3,Not worth the money,"I just rec'd this item and to my dismay found it to be very ""thin"" in size compared to the others I already have in my feeders. I dont even think it is 1/2 in.thick. Wont be purchasing this again."
2,WHERE'S THE SUET,The suet cakes are half the thickness of any other brand of cakes that I havepurchased very disappointed Net wt. 9.25oz
4,Birds enjoy the snack,"Although the birds seem to really enjoy the snack, I did have a surprise with the size. I did not catch the size of the block. It is smaller than what I was used to. It probably cost less but I didn't catch the size before ordering. Still a great product, just don't want you to be surprised as I was."
5,Sit back and enjoy the show,Perhaps these are a little smaller than some suet cakes but the quality of this product seems to be very high. These cakes attract so many birds to my feeder I feel like my backyard is now a scene from Animal Planet. I keep my binoculars on the table to enjoy the endless viewing and activity at the feeder. It's like having bird TV! I have learned that the packages are a little difficult to peel off so simply keep a sharp knife or box cutter handy when opening the protective top layer. Then sit back and enjoy the show.
2,A potboiler,"A potboiler is defined as an inferior work done purely for money. Both this novel and its predecessor, ""Wellspring of Chaos"", fall clearly into this category. These are the first Recluce novels which are simply poor. One senses that Modesitt is bored.The novels are not too bad, but they are pedestrian."
4,Another great story by Modesitt,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was the continuation of the story about Kharl the cooper. The book flows well and kept me interested in every chapter.The publisher needs a rather large kick in the back side for the grammer, spelling and punctuation mistakes in the book. Very disapointing to see work from a top class story teller be adulterated in such a way.The story is part of the Recluse series, so anyone who reads this series will love it. Glad I started reading these books again."
5,Wonderful book ...,"as is virtually anything ever written by L.E. Modesitt Jr. I have been an avid sci-fi fan for most of my life, and still feel that he is among the giants in the field. The Recluce books are a rather long series, and I'd advise you to start with the first one in the series and move on from there. This one is eleven or twelve I think. I think Modesitt is right up there with Robert Heinlein, Marion Zimmer Bradley (Darkover books), Andre Norton (Witch World books), David Brin, Niven and Pournelle. Check them out."
4,"More cryptic, less engaging than the first trilogy","Curious - this trilogy (a sequel to the Griffin & Sabine trilogy) was in many ways a more exciting story than the first. And the format and artwork was comparable, but somehow, when completed, it did not seem to have the overall impact that the first trilogy did. Still an enjoyable read and, as I said, a more exciting story in the classic good-guy/bad-guy sense. If you really enjoyed the first trilogy, you will want to read this if for no other reason than to 'complete' the story."
2,Informative but not objective?... it's an Infomercial,"Not to pan the book entirely: it's an easy read and offers hope as well as some helpful information - but I have two issues.First, there are innumerable references to products which provide profit for the ""Medical Editor"", Dr. Murray Grossan. I'm a user of one of his products, and I'd endorse it too - but not under the guise of an medical self-help book.The second item that makes me wonder about the expertise of the author (""A long time sinus sufferer""). Opposite the title page are some of the other titles from the author - ""The Super Aspirin Cure for Arthritis"". ""Super Calcium Counter..."". ""The Osteoporosis Cure"". ""The Fibromyagia Handbook"". Can ""The Tao of Ephedra"" be far away?The book is worth a read. But if you're deciding between it and other well-rated volumes - I'd look elsewhere."
5,Excellent sinus resource book. Highly Recommend to anyone,This book takes the pain out of sinus headaches! I have suffered with sinusitis my entire life it seems but this book gave me some new answers. I particularly like the holistic slant and the section on hydrotherapy and botanicals. I'm tired of taking antibiotics because they are a short-term bandaid. This book has given me months of relief.
5,Excellent,"Having sinus problems my whole life, I found this book a breath of fresh air! Easy to follow and very helpful!"
5,Comprehensive review for the layman,A good review of sinus disease and management written to allow the non-physician to gain from reading it.
5,Relief at last with this book. Thank you!,"Thank you Drs Bruce & Grossan. I have suffered with chronic sinusitis for YEARS--my whole life, it seems. I had almost given up hope that I could ever feel healthy again as the constant infections made me tired and achy. My head hurt 24/7.But this book changed my life. Your program is superb and easy. I now combine a nasal steroid spray with saline irrigation DAILY. I have not had medication (except for a decongestant) for about 5 months. I highly recommend that if you have sinusitis, you should READ this book and follow the program. It will give you back your life!"
3,SOME Good Advice,"I bought this book out of complete desperation. I have suffered more than 20 years with chronic infections. I have done it all 2 sinus surgeries, allergy meds, allergy shots and home remedies. This book did provide some great education on diet tips, sinus irrigation, allergies and asthma. I think it is a great book if you are lost and are unaware of contributing factors. However, all these remedies have helped a little, but I still suffer terribly. So where to go from here??"
2,Glad I bought this used....,"This book had a few good tips - but after dealing with sinus problems for 9 months I had already tried much of what the book suggested. I felt most of the text was dedicated to selling Dr. Grossan's products. I would reccomend checking this out from the library to see its the book's suggestions help but I wouldn't waste any money on it.With a little digging on reliable web sites you will find just as good, if not better information."
1,PA Jim's review,this author has a bunch of friends that have given her good reviews - don't buy this book based on these misleading tactics
5,Very credible. Well written. VERY HELPFUL with high pollen.,"This is VERY IRONIC!!! I just heard the author Debra Bruce on the radio in Atlanta, Georgia this morning. A friend gave me her book three weeks ago and I read it--cover to cover. An interesting and easy read. This was BEFORE tree pollen season hit the South. I used the techniques suggested in the book--the nasal saline irrigation, avoiding iced drinks, avoiding key pollen times, and a nasal steroid spray. I changed my medication to a decongestant/antihistamine combo. For the FIRST time in my life--I have MY LIFE. It's super. I'm not a shut-in anymore. Thank you for a very credible book. A must read for ANYONE with sinusitis."
3,Decent book,"This book contains a lot of good information. The other reviewers are correct that you can find much of this information on the Internet, but if you want a handy reference that has a lot of tips for sinus sufferers in one place, this is a good book to have."
4,A Good Reason To See Why Betty Grable Was a Major Star!,"Wonderful musical comedy with Betty Grable in top form as Broadway star who abandons her partner/fiance, John Payne, for the Canadian Rockies when she believes him to be stepping out on her. Once there, she meets up with past dance partner Cesar Romero and uses him to make Payne jealous when he himself shows up at the resort where they are working as a team. The colorful Carmen Miranda is also a stand-out in a hilarious role as the girl Payne uses to try to get Grable jealous as well. The cast is rounded out by the delightfully comical Charlotte Greenwood and Grable's future husband, Harry James, who contributes to the musical goings-on with his fabulous trumpet playing. Lively production numbers and gorgeous Technicolor, not to mention the beautiful Grable herself, make this a fun treat for late-night viewing."
4,Fun! Fun! Fun!,"John Payne, Charlotte Greenwood, Betty Grable and Carmen Miranda contribute to this light concoction that has wonderful dance and musical numbers, but very little in the way of plot. However, everything is light and breezy and quite entertaining."
2,Wasted potential,"Dark Reel starts out promisingly enough, with the ghastly murder of Scarlett May (Alexandra Holden) being committed years earlier, leading us to meeting an uber-fan named Adam (Edward Furlong) who has won a contest to be an extra in the latest film starring his favorite B-movie actress Cassie Blue (Tiffany Shepis). Not long after that, more murders start occuring, and Adam starts seeing apparitions of Scarlett. There is much potential in Dark Reel that sadly gets wasted due to the fact that the film is poorly paced, and overall pretty boring as well. The gore effects, when they do occur, are pretty well done, but the various in-jokes and a sleepwalking performance from Furlong don't help matters any. Genre stalwarts Lance Henriksen and Tony Todd are here as well, and chew up as much scenery as they can manage to do. All in all, despite its slowness, Dark Reel is worth a look for slasher/mystery fans, but don't expect much from it in the least."
2,REEL BAD,Don't let the cast lure you into high hopes. A tubby Edward Furlong is awful; Lance Henriksen and Tony Todd look embarrassed; Tiffany Sephis has never had any acting abilities. Only Emmanuel Xuerub as the killer manages to get by.It's slow and predictable and cheaply made. Gives cheese a whole new meaning!
1,Not worth the time or $1.00 rental fee from Redbox,"I am a big horror film fan and had hoped that I would get my $1.00 RedBox DVD worth of a movie. This film is not close to a good ""B"" movie horror film from the past. It was painful to watch and the acting was terrible. I kept thinking that it would get better as the film progressed but it did not. If I had actually paid good money to watch in a movie theatre I would have walked out and demanded a refund. I can not believe that there is really going to be a Dark Reel 2."
5,Great Little Scale,"I love this scale. It is very accurate and does not require an expensive battery. The large bowl has a pour spout and clean up is very easy. I love the flip and store feature. It creates a compact package and there is no need to store the bowl and base separately.The scale has an interesting but simple way to zero out before use. Just turn until the dial reads zero and you are set to weigh liquids or dry ingredients in any bowl (dish or pan) that fits on the base. In addition to the bowl that comes with the scale, I have used my Tupperware bowls on the base without problems.It is a great little scale and a great value. Unlike the digital scales, this analog scale will cost you nothing after purchase as there are no expensive batteries to buy. I'm sold!"
1,Terrible scale,"I purchased this scale based on the good reviews of other and the low price. I could never get the scale to weigh food with a consistant weight. I would weigh the exact same item two and three times and never get the same weight. And, the variance was not just small...sometimes up to 5ozs. I even had my husband try the scale to make sure it wasn't just me. He had the same trouble with the scale."
4,Diet Scale,"Easy to use scale for calculating calories during a diet. It is easier to use a salad plate or saucer on the scale rather than the bowl provided. Just place the plate on the scale and zero it out. Do not use a plate that is too large, because you will not be able to read the scale."
1,doble juego,"This movie was a waste of my money. That is all i can say because its very boring and although i saw the whole movie, i felt that i should have not. There is a man trying to get over on others and when they discover what he is about they try to confront him but he is no where to be found. I just did not like it."
2,Pointless!!!,"This movie is pointless, it is not fast paced. The acting is dull and it has no ending. Don't waste your time, period."
4,Its worth the money...,"The handle on this brush is made of an unknown wood, but it is light and strong. The horse hair is soft enough not to mar your fine woodwork, yet stiff enough to sweep efficiently. The length of the handle and width of the bristles are the perfect size for sweeping sawdust off a bench, tablesaw, etc.There's not much to review on a horse hair bench brush, but I can attest that this brush is decent quality and definitely worth the money."
2,Not impressed,"This bar is larger that most nutrition or meal replacement bars - that much is true. What is also true is that is contains more fat.What you will notice with the first bite, is that the bar seems somehow ""inflated"". There is an emptiness to consistency of the bar. You are not getting the quality nutrition you would get from a Myoplex or Apex bar. Stick with those brands for pure nutrition and FAR BETTER TASTE.These METRX bars leave you feeling as though you've eaten something that was bad for you - like after you eat a dessert, yet these will not be mistaken for desserts."
2,It seems like a good grill untill you look under the bottom removable grid,"I got this about a year ago, and like most electric grills, it takes awhile to heat up. No problem. It cooks really well but it it's kind of clunky looking.What really turned me off is that after installing the grill grids and heating it up, while grilling anything, some of the grease did NOT drip down to the removable drip tray...instead it ran underneath the removabole bottom grid and got close to the heating element.This is not a good design and I discontinued using it. I email the maker who was not at all helpful or understood the issue.So, I replaced it the Hamilton Beach 25325 Grill...and I like it much more.This dripping/leaking into the bottom heating area really makes this a worthless grill.As a Waffle Iron, it's a better product."
3,Sponsored By Tide,Too much soap opera and not enough mystery and intrigue. This series must have the same writers as the latest Wallander offerings. Too many problems with children or ex-spouses. Dilutes the real story lines. Can't we show their human side by just having a love interest thread?
3,More or less,"This product don't protect enough, let the chest very vulnerable, and the laterals of the body, but it's look very ""nice"" lol...just... More or less..."
2,"DOES NOT BREATH, But you pay for what you get","In VA, the humidity + the heat will cause heat stroke in a blink of an eye. This protection vest does what it is supposed and fits alright. I'm 5'9"" 190 with a tire in the mid section. The padding is good. For this day and age, breath-ability is critical in this sport. I haven't seen a single PB specific product that doesn't market that feature. There is a cheap feeling to this, too cheap. I would expect to have paid maybe 20 in comparison to the other protectors on the market. Looks cool but can't wear it until it gets cooler out."
2,One size fits all???,"""one size fits all"" this quote does not have merrit in the items listing. I feel like Chris Farley singing ""fat guy in a little coat. I would reccomend that Spyder go back and fabricate a second sixe for us XL and larger fellas. Other than the size issue the padding works as advertised taking direct hits with no problem"
5,Motive Product Power Bleeder Review,The instructions were good. Very easy to use and did as intended. I did have some minor leakage between the hose connection between the resevoir cap hose and tank hose. Otherwise it worked well. Nice not having to shout instructions to push and release the brake petal. I used the system on a 2001 Chevy 3500 dually to completely flush the brake fluid with new and it only took about 30 minutes. It was harder to open the caliper bleeder valves than anything else. I would definitely recommend this system.
5,A MUST have for the shade-tree mechanic,"I cannot believe that I've been without this tool for such a long time!! Makes bleeding the brakes a simple, 1 man job. No mess, no fuss, just pressurize the system, open each bleeder at a time, and bingo, DONE!!! Easy clean up, a must have."
3,Not recumbent specific,"This is advertised as being a recumbent fender, but don't be fooled. The only thing about this that makes it special for recumbents is that you don't have to buy them in pairs, so you can get different sizes for the front and back. Other than that it's just a regular fender. The instructions are for a diamond frame bike, and it took some modification to fit the rear one on my recumbent. All-in-all it seems to be working so far, but nothing special."
1,"Please don't buy, picture does not represent product, You don't get 2","Picture is misleading, You only get one fender. Even Title is misleading. Only after you add to your cart will you see the addendum that its for the rear.Don't buyDon't buyDon't buy"
2,rear fender keeps coming loose,I purchased a set of these and had them installed by my local recumbent specialist. Any time I would go over a bump one of the vertical fender stays popped out of the socket. The solution was to use glue to keep it in. I think it has to do with my rear suspension.I recommend fenders with more permanent stays even if they need to be cut.
3,Absorbent pads... kind of,"I bought these for lining a pen for my cat. They are definitely light-weight; my cat moves them all around in her pen and they end up not in the right place a lot of times! I bought these pads because so many of the ""pet pads"" are for training your pet and so they are infused with aromas to encourage you pet to ""use"" them. I, in fact, wanted my cat to use the litter box in the pen, not the floor, so I did not want to encourage her to use the pad. Hence, I got these unscented pads. They are definitely not as heavy or absorbent as the pet pads. I would say they do not absorb nearly as well; I think they are very thin, and can't imagine using them for a person who is much heavier than my cat and I would think eliminates a lot more fluid than my cat. But, these are just my thoughts. I don't think I would really recommend them for pet beds, especially if you cannot anchor them in place somehow."
3,Not too bad buy,The earlier videos were of a lesser quality than the later ones. i thought that the technology would've alllowed for all to be consistently good.
1,NEVER buy watch from KENMAR watches,"I BOUGHT THIS WATCH FROM AMAZON BUT WATCH CAME FROM KENMAR WATCHES.COMI WAS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE WATCH....PUT IT ON IMMEDIATELY, WORE IT THE REST OF THE DAY AND TOOK A QUICK SHOWER THAT NITE W/ THE WATCH ON MY WRIST (100M WATER RESISTANT) BY MORNING THE WATCH WAS COMPLETELY FOGGED UP AND NOT WORKING. I EMAILED KENMAR WATCHES AND THEY BASICALLY SAID: TOO BAD"".I HAVE SHOWERED, BATHED, SWAM W/ SIMILAR WATCHES MY ENTIRE LIFE AND HAVE NEVER HAD ONE TO DO THIS. (ALL SWISS ARMY WATCHES...AS WAS THIS ONE WAS) IF I HAD A DISPOSABLE INCOME I MAY NOT BE AS UPSET...BUT I HAD BEEN PLANNING AND SAVING UP TO PURCHASE THIS WATCH FOR ABOUT 4 MONTHS....FINALLY GOT THE WATCH AND THEN THIS HAPPENED. NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.IN THE END, I WENT TO WALMART AND PURCHASED A CHEAP TIMEX...AND I SHOWER W/ IT ON MY WRIST EACH AND EVERY DAY. (IT TOO IS 100M WATER RESISTANT) I WOULD NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING OF THIS VALUE THROUGH AMAZON AGAIN......"
5,CD Man,If you are a fan of the Beatles and who isn't then this is a must...Very Liverpool sounding with great vocals...
1,Didn't work,The charger didn't work so I sent it back to Clore. Recently I've had very bad experiences with electrically based imports from China. There seems to be a total lack of quality control.

5,Great Looking !,"I have this toaster in RED ! It looks great, is sturdily built, & does a great job . I especially like the ""manual"" pop-up feature-- no more burnt fingers, or fishing with a fork to get at your bagel or muffin."
1,My dog wouldn't eat it!,"My dog would not eat it and so, I ended up giving it away... I will never buy this flavor again. Chicken breast is best!"
5,LOVE the scent,I always buy this for my husband--he likes the way it feels and I love the way it smells = great combo.
3,Go for the first pressing.,"The first CD pressing (produced back in 1992) has the libretto -- written in Italian, not Latin -- that many people sorely miss in this reissue. Incidentally, if you are more comfortable with French or want to brush up your rusty German, you're in luck -- there are three translations in all.The first pressing is available through Amazon at the time of this review. This particular recording by Minkowski is worth every penny of your investment, libretto or no libretto. It's no stretch at all to say that Minkowski's revival of Stradella puts this oratorio (quasi un'opera) in the same league as the very best of Rameau -- perhaps the very best of opera, period.Just to kvetch about this a little longer: It's one thing to say MODERN opera libretti are so commonplace that CDs can be reissued without them. Foolishly, Erato's marketers, obviously cutting corners, would have you believe that libretti of baroque works are dispensable. Not so."
2,You NEED the Libretto!,"This curiously operatic 'oratorio' was composed with an Italian libretto. The music is full of odd passions that will seem disembodied and extraneous without at least a cursory notion of who the character is who's singing, and what she/he is singing about. King Herod especially needs his language, since basso Philippe Huttenlocher does odd stuff with his voice in order to suggest the King's madness. Even if you speak fluent Italian, by the way, as I do, you won't be able to follow the words. In fact, you'll be outraged at the abysmal accents.Nevertheless, this is a sparkling performance, a five-star job of singing, so DO look for the 1992 release!"
2,nothing special,"I purchased this after reading a book on skin types, but I don't think I'll continue to use it. It probably works fine, but I didn't think it was anything special. The main reason I don't like it is that it smells like a man's aftershave."
1,Mother Nature printed in title is too small to read,"The cricket sounds on Moonlight Sonata were so loud I could hardly hear the music. I listened for a few seconds and took it out. I was dismayed that I could not read ""Mother Nature""....in the title. I would not have purchased this had I known it was so full of nature sounds."
2,How to ruin great music,"Fabulous selections from our greatest composers are ravaged by amateurish nature sounds. And to make things worse, the almost comical nature sounds compete with the music instead of staying in the background. If you want Muzac, you might like this, but if you want the music, buy something else."
1,Broke before ever used,Got this as a Christmas gift and haven't had a chance to use it until late April. Plugged it in and noticed there is no (on and off) switch. Only had it on for approx 1 minute to see if it would get hot so I wouldn't wind up leaving it on all night. Came back about 30 sec later and it was on the lowest setting so I unplugged the cord out of the side of it and a few seconds I heard a pop. I got up and saw that the glass shattered on the entire thing and I was planning on using for my son's birthday the next day. Now I don't know if I have a receipt since my husband got it as a Christmas gift and now I have to make sure none of the glass shattered on the birthday stuff already on the table. Expensive item and never even one use.
5,An unsurpassed tale of adventure.,"This is definitely a book you want to read. After about 2 days of not putting it down I finally finished it. The adventures of d'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos and Aramis are amazingly entertaining. Dumas is truly a master when it comes to his work. You will actually care about the characters and will want to know what happens to them next. And if you think you have read about bad villains before, you haven't read about Milady. She's the devil herself! I recommend this to anyone who wants a great story, one which will make you laugh and cry, and understand some very important things in life."
5,The Three Musketeers is the BEST Book I have ever read!!!,"The Three Musketeers is another awesome creation by Alexandre Dumas. It stars a young Frenchman, named D'artagnan, and his three friends Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. Together they encounter many plots of Cardinal Richeliu, help out the Queen recover some diamond tags, fight numerous duels, and meet the evil woman named Lady de Winter. This book is full of adventure and thrill and will keep you reading anywhere you are. I read the unabridged version in 17 days while backpacking long days in the North Cascades. When you finish, you are craving more adventure and more of Alexandre Dumas' writings."
4,Subtext contra socialism,"Malia's book, following on similar work in Soviet Tragedy, aims at making history out of the so-called great thinkers that loved or hated Russia in tsarist and Soviet forms. As always, his main target is Karl Marx and the intellectuals who would impose similar ideas onto real life--the nasty results of which were made especially clear in the unqualified disaster of Oct 1917. 1917 plays the critical role of sabotaging one kind of European development in favor of a socialist path (which also can be seen as European). And unfortunately, the only non-Euro perception of Russia emerges from the dissidents who lay bare the bones of the Soviet skeleton. The book interestingly shows how Europeans over centuries wavered in their view of Russia, but the real target is socialism and the horrific spectacle that it finally manifested before 1991 (and which some have not yet recognized)."
3,Not about Russia at all but about the West.,"I'm not quite finished but find the book stimulating and useful. I suspect the title and subtitle are there to garner readers who would not read yet another book about liberalism and marxism. But the book is really about European ideas and not about Russia. Russia is seen through the ideas of Europe. That is not a criticism of the book, only a criticism of its marketing and packaging."
4,Great little book,"Many others have said it much more eloquently, but this is a great little starter book. I've found that sometimes the best books for instructing are those that are a little on the ""dated"" side and tend to go more indepth than modern books.I purchased this book so that it might help me understand sentence structure and thus help me decipher a much older work that is written in Medieval Portuguese. It has helped, along with online references.So, if you're interested in learning Portuguese, this is a good place to start."
4,"Good, basic portuguese grammer reference",This is a good reference and textbook for learningportuguese. I have found it very useful inmy studies
3,"horrible installation, okay product","Installation took forever, because there was nothing neat about it - download this, download that, sync the other... Endless. Not for the faint of heart. And the ongoing synching of documents does not integrate with the BlackBerry Desktop sync program, as it used to do for the Palm OS. As for usability, the product itself can only do so much on a puny BlackBerry, so I can sort of look at some Word documents, spreadsheets, PowerPoints, and PDFs, but it's pretty cumbersome to view and edit. I didn't give it a lower rating because the fault here lies just as much with the limited capacity of BlackBerries."
3,Immature product,"I have used Documents To Go since 2004 (version 6) on a Sony Clie SJ22, Palm Tungsten E, Tungsten E2 and Palm TX. Support of Docs2Go products lag quite a distance behind Microsoft Office developments. Things were finally working very well in late 2006 between Documents To Go 9 and Office 2000/2003 on my Palm TX, with being able to read and write (MS Word particularly) under both operating sytems. Then in November 2006 I bought a new PC with Office 2007. As of August 2007 Documents To Go 10 still limits Office 2007 support to Read Only on the Palm. So if you still have Office 2003 or earlier I would recommend this product. If you've gone to Office 2007, wait a while."
4,"Attractive, simple, and works fine.","The scale does everything you'd expect from a nice digital scale, and looks as good as the picture. The controls could not be much simpler -- there's only one button! -- and the display is exceptionally clear and easy to read, with big black numbers.The only negative for me is that one button is actually too few. The machine tries to guess whether you mean ""set zero"" or ""turn off"" depending on when you push the button, so it can take more than one try to turn it off. And to change between grams and ounces requires turning the machine over and removing a rubber cover to get to a truly hidden switch. Simplicity is great, but they took it a bit too far."
3,"Looks similar, but not the same!","While this item looks very similar to the Soehnle scale that won ""America's Test Kitchen"" honors, note that this scales's capacity is only 4 lbs, whereas the previous scale won partially because of its 11 lb capacity.On the plus side, this scale is about $30 cheaper, and just as good looking. On the down side, there appears to be no direct replacement for last years 11lb model (Edit: The Soehnle 66524 is a similar design and handles 11lbs)"
3,Simple to use,"An accurate scale that looks good. The base is aluminum looking plastic, while the scale tray is good quality glass. For $100 I expected an aluminum base. If you do need to change the units from US to metric, removing the rubber base and finding a knife or other sharp instrument to move the selector is fiddly and annoying."
2,Nice while it lasted!,"I was quite happy with this scale when I first received it. I rarely use metric, so the inconvenient conversion switch was not a problem. It also seemed quite accurate. But within a few months I began to have trouble with it malfunctioning. Usually, if I switched it off for a few minutes, it would be fine when I switched it back on. I wasn't the battery, because I got a new one for it. It lasted a few more months then began to give me an error reading every other time I used it. Again I bought a new battery, but to no avail. Eventually it would only give me an error reading. Forget about trying to contact Soehnle! I ended up just throwing it out. It lasted less than a year."
5,Great little scale!!,"I just received this and I Love it!!Easy to use, lightweight, and very accurate!!So, Glad I bought it at the sale price last week!"
4,Chimayo easel,Overall I am very happy with this product. The wood is beautiful and the parts are well made. My only complaint is in reference to the instructions for putting it together--they were not terribly clear.
4,Warm memoir of adopting four children,"An Indiana couple unable to have children decide to adopt. Guided by their strong Christian beliefs, they adopt siblings Joe and Ruth. Later, having weathered the ups and downs of that adoption, they adopt another pair of siblings, Tom and Beth.A pleasant older book about adoption."
4,Tandoori Seuss,"I must confess I'm not the biggest fan of 'slithy toves' or 'cats in hats,' but I found several verses in this book that satisfy. Mostly, I was taken with the pieces that go beyond slithy tovedom and settle into recognizable social commentary. For example, The Miracle Man mocks the arrogance of physicians with a sharp yet not quite piercing tongue (and after surviving my HMO I found it delicious). The Customs of Bombagarh takes on royalty, while The Pursuit of Science tackles psychiatrists with the same spirit. Finally, the very funny Super Beast can be used to help children build self esteem (simply change the last two lines to: ""Not shoe nor a sunshade, I'll have to be me!"") Warning: it is impossible not to read aloud from this book. Make sure someone else is home when you do it or the neighbors will talk."
5,Great detailed information.,This book gives almost every detail about every Buick model ever made. I started at the beginning to track the evolution of the brand but this is very well suited as a general reference book about Buicks. My only issues are occasional typos and the lack of pictures for every model in every year. Highly recommended!
3,"Ok, but lots of errors","The book is fairly through, but it lacks photo of several models, and has many photographs identified with either the wrong year or wrong model."
2,Cheap and from China....,"I gave this as a gift. I will not buy it again. Alot of pieces, but felt cheap. Some were falling out when I opened it. Inside plastic was a bit chipped (I dont think this was Amazon's fault). I'll pay a bit more for Crayola or another brand name next time. It was alot of stuff for the money..."
3,okay for the price...,"My biggest complaint with this set is the case. It is very flimsy plastic and rips/tears/gets bent easily. This is not an art set for your kid to cart around all over the place as pieces will inevitably get lost.For the price, however, the variety of supplies is excellent. I would recommend this for someone who is just getting into art. I would recommend higher quality supplies for a serious child artist."
2,Construction Mathmatics review 02/19/11,"The mathmatics whithin the book is based on the metric system, although the rest of the planet makes use of this system, we hard headed Americans still resist. The book would have been useful for other applications, but I needed information and references for the public works sector of construction, such as excavation, concrete work, pipeline, etc. The references inside looked easy to read and understand. I hope my review was helpful."
3,Not that great,"The author of this book gives a lot of his opions, which we the reader don't really care about. The episode summaries are too brief. All in all it is not that good a read."
2,Nice cover - shame about the book.,"A disapointing read. Various sections read like hastily written padding and there is no real analysis of the Seinfeld phenomenon. The author also indulges in a lots of 'cutesy' chat with the reader, most of which is pretty well incomprehensible to a reader like me from the UK. If you're looking for a book like this try 'Seinfield Universe'. (A note to US fans: here in the UK Seinfeld is virtually unknown - it goes out at 11.15pm Tuesday nights on BBC2 and gets no trailers or promotion. How odd then that the BBC should release their own UK edition of 'Seinfield Universe'...)"
2,David Wild Must Die!,"Seinfeld is a great show, best sitcom ever, so any book about it is gonna get at least 2 stars on the merit of it's subject matter.... HOWEVER.... I feel this to be just about the worst Seinfeld book possible because the author is a pretentious no-talent...who writes in idiotic circles...."
2,Okay...,"I loved the Seinfeld episode, but this book doesn't really do it justice. For all you, who like love, and dating in New York City with a quirky ""Seinfeld"" character, try the Blind Date King.... it's dating and romance in NYC. A quick read, funny and heartwarming."
2,Just plain bad,I read this book with high hopes and while there are a fewnicely crafted sentances it is abismal in general.Shooting Elvis is like a bad made for TV movie in thein the vein of Natural Born Killers but utterly guttedof insight. It is rife with overburdened attemptsat cleverness.<<<These opinions are personal and not held by my employeer>>>
1,Awful.,"I was very disappointed with this book, which read less like a novel, and more like a third-rate 80's movie script, with a particular female pop star and serious-actress-wannabe (you know who I mean) in the starring role.The plot is entirely predictable: you really can see what's coming, and one 'plot twist' in particular is so obvious that it just makes you cringe. The characters are one-dimensional and unsympathetic: I found myself rooting for the bad guys in pursuit of the heroine, rather than the heroine herself.The whole thing struck me as though it was trying terribly hard to be cool, but it just didn't have the substance to back it up.All in all, a triumph of style over content."
4,An interesting new protagonist,Mary/Nina is a product of her environment and the company she keeps. But she's also a tough survivor with a wry outlook on life. You can't help but like her. The action is fast-paced and certainly depicts the unglamorous side of Los Angeles. I shall keep following the trials and tribulations of Nina.
5,Its a keeper,"I read this a couple years ago and was thinking about it recently and wanted to read another like it. Thankfully Robert has written a sequel, I hope its as good as the last. Adventure, intrigue and a bit of excitement in Shooting Elvis. I enjoyed it and look forward to reading the next one."
4,A fun ride through LA,I found this book to be entertaining.It's fast and has a sense of humor. Nina Zero makes a great lead character and I want to read more. Her transition from an hourly wage slave to fugitive on the run is fun to watch. Plus the author's take on LA is well done.This book is worth the time to sit and read.
1,Save your money,"As the previous reviewer mentioned, this is not really a book but an excerpt from another book. It took me about 15 minutes to read the entire ""book"". Does not offer any real information that you can't find in the Help menus from SharePoint or Access. Spend your money on a more comprehensive book."
5,Copied from Chapter 21,"I just purchase the Kindle Version. After reviewing the contents, I realized this is an excerpt from Alison's Book Mastering Microsoft Office Access 2007 Development."
3,"Same old, same old...","Although some wonderful performances are captured here, most of them are available in other documentaries. I was hoping for something more up to date, but like most of the Olympic ""histories"", this one only goes up to about 1996.If you don't have any of the others, this is worth having. One plus is that there is less vocal narrative than on many of the other histories covering the same time period."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"I ordered Panasonic RP-HT770, because I have been a happy owner of RP-F500 for many years. The latter are just a great pair of headphones: sound is perfect for a product in this price range, comfort is good. But after long years of faithful service they finally started to fall apart.As part of my research for a new pair of quality headphones, I came across RP-HT770 here. The sound picture is much flatter, and you get additional squeaky sounds from the cheap plastic. I was quite disappointed.Mind you that I had originally bought RP-F500 after extensively comparing them to all expensive headphones offered at a big hi-fi store. Their sound had beaten all the others' sound hands down. So I had high hopes for RP-HT770, which is both a newer and more expensive version by the same maker.Alas, they didn't even come close. I tried hard to love them, but they simply came short, so I had to finally give them away. I am still using my old pair of RP-F500."
3,"Works great, but hard to clean...","Pros:So Pretty!Cooks evenly!Non-stick surface works great!Especially great for sandwiches because of the flexible hinge.High quality product!Cons:Grooves are deep making it a pain to clean, especially after cooking meats.Doesn't have a digital tempature gage.No timer.Doesn't have removable plates, which would be especially nice.If I were to do it again, well, I'd probably still be tempted by this grills beauty and quality. But there's a new George Foreman grill that I think I'd rather have now. It has it all, removable plates, digital tempature gage and timer, it just doesn't have the beauty of the Villaware. Although review aren't in on that one yet."
3,"Great for panini, not as good for meats","I have owned this Villaware Uno Panini Grill for about a month, and use it constantly. I bought it as a George Foreman substitute, and use it primarily for chicken, fish, and burgers. Although it does a very good job on all of those meats, I have spent an inordinate amount of time cleaning this machine. With meat, as opposed to a sandwhich, cleanup is a bit more involved, and since you can't get some of it wet - complications arise. Could someone please invent a machine just like this one, but with removable grill plates?The other thing to be aware of is the temperature gage. Paninis seem to require a hotter surface, while meats sear instantly on the lowest temp. Be careful with steaks if you like them rare to med-rare. It is easy to overcook them. At times, i'd like to slow down the cooking a little, but this is not really a major problem."
5,Amazing,"Bought it for panini's, suprised with meats. Made juicy tender perfect chicken breasts in less than 10 minutes. Used a polder thermometer to monitor the progress. Perfect grill marks on juicy tender chicken.Pros:-Powerful heating elements-Truly nonstick-Floating top plate allows large capacity for thick sandwiches, meats with even browning-Includes indispensible cleaning tool-Drip spout and tray-Variable temp control-Stay cool handle-Cord wrap in base-Solid constructionCons:-noneLack of on/off switch not missed...one less step to perfect paninis. We use is 2-4 times a week."
5,Great Panini,"We have used this grill many times since it arrived and have nothing but good things to say about it. It truly does produce excellent paninis with hardly any effort at all. We have also used it to grill lemon rosemary chicken breasts, herbed pork chops, and grilled seasoned begetables. I actually prefer this unit over my full size gas grill for the chicken and pork recipes since it grills both sides at the same time - reducing the lose of spices from the meat by it accidentally falling through the grates on the gas grill while it is cutting. If I ever have it break on me - it will be quickly replaced.Cleaning is not the easiest chore - but really not that big an issue. You just need to clean it next to the sink so that you can rinse the service thoroughly and it cleans pretty quickly."
5,Great Panini Grill,"This product works great for us. We thought we may not use it very much but it turns out to be used often. I like to grill up quesadillas (I like them slightly crunchy).Sturdy constructionNo on/off switch, we just unplug it when we are done.The drip pan is a little awkward to setup, it feels like it should connect to the grill. But I don't think it does.I recommend this product."
5,Very Fine Product,"This is a very fine product. I've only used it a hand full of times since Christmas but it cooks excellent and is easy to clean. It does take a little bit longer then I expected to fully heat-up, about 10 minutes. Our unit came with recipes and an extra cookbook, which was a pleasant surprise. I would highly suggest this Panini Press."
4,Panini Grill,"I bought the grill because a friend told me how much they enjoyed panini sandwiches and I am glad I did. We are enjoying the grill immensely and have used it for all kinds of sandwiches. It cooks great! Clean-up is a bit of a challenge as you have to be careful not to immerse the grill in water while dealing with the hinged lid, but you figure a way quickly. I would buy it again."
1,Do not buy this panini grill,I ordered and received this grill this past January. It is almost impossible to clean. The grilling surfaces are not removable to facilitate washing and foods stick to it in spite of the so called non-stick surfaces. Cheeses become attached like glue the first time you use the grill. After several uses the unit does not heat up properly and takes forever to grill the panini. I understand that this product has been discontinued by the manufacturer and I can understand why.Today I finally threw it in the garbage and ordered the Cuisinart GR-4 Griddler which has removable grills which can be easily cleaned by hand or put in the dishwasher.
2,Avoid this Villaware panini grill,"Had this for a year or two and it stopped working completely. There is NO customer support from the manufacturer. Worked great til it died, but should not have died so soon. Would not buy again."
5,first time user,"Received the grill very poorly packed. Luckily the manufacturer had put in a very sturdy box which saved it from damage. The UPS driver told us to watch out for the botton of the box letting go.The rest of this review is a definite positive on this grill. Well constructed and on the first try made a great sandwich. Very easy to clean in spite of not coming apart for washing which I think might ultimatly be a problem with grills that do come apart-they might stay that way, who knows!I agree with the other reviewers who say that it could use a power switch but it really isn't much trouble to pull a plug.There was no leaking grease on the counter top after use and I do not regret buying the grill. It will be a good addition to the kitchen."
2,buyer beware villaware,I bought one of these a couple years ago and wanted to give you some consumer feedback. It works great and is attractive but after a few years -conveniently after it no longer has warranty coverage the non stick surface completely breaks down - peeling off in long hunks diminishing it's sexyness and functionality quite a bit. I spoke with a villa ware representative who pretty much told me tough luck.
4,If you love Panini's...,"I bought this as a gift for my parents for christmas. I have one from the same manufacturer but cost $30 more.This was a great product for the money. The only problem is there is no on/off switch, you have to unplugg it. I would still highly recommend to others."
4,"Great for paninis, challenging for ""grilling""","I bought this more making paninis and while I don't really eat as many as I thought I would when I bought it, it is still nice to have. It heats up fairly quickly and heats evenly. I have used this primarily for making sandwiches, when tend to not make too much of a mess. Cooking meats or other things on here is something I'm a little averse to because it is difficult to clean. The bottom plate's grooves are very deep, which means you have to use the cleaning tool they provide (and which I seem to have lost), and even then a lot of grease will be left behind. It does help that it's non-stick, but grills with removable plates seem so much more convenient. Nonetheless, the quality is unquestionable and I've had no performance issues. Recommended."
2,effective but design is flawed internally,"The grill is an effective panini maker. It is a bit heavy on the upper and the small ribs can smush a sandwich. It is not that easy to clean. In my mind the grill is a 4/5 cookerHowever, I have to take away two stars due to the fact that the handle is connected to the upper plate with two screws that thread into metal internally that is very poor quality. Ultimately they worked themselfs out and the entire handle came loose. Eventually (after about 4 years) the threads on the metal on the inside of the upper plate were completely stripped and I had to open it up to put in a nut (metric) to replace the worn out pot metal that was used. I am hoping that this will hold for a few more years, but if it doesn't, I'll get another brand next go round."
2,Kind of annoying,"We own a few of the Barbie movies and my 3 year old daughter wanted this one too. I was a bit hesitant because I didn't really like the look of the littler character. After watching it I was even more disappointed. The voices of the fairy characters are very annoying and even though the message is good in the end, the way the friends behave is not exactly good viewing material for the young girls watching this. I also was disappointed at the lack of songs, which is one thing I like about most of the other movies. Stick with some of the other movies!"
5,?,I really cannot tell you how I like the above because they were both gifts :). They did arrive in good condition and were on time.
3,Thumbelina?,"so I knew this wasn't really the story of Thumbelina, but it is very far from it, my daughter (4 and a half) however loved it, it does have a good lesson of what real friends are and what is not a real friend."
2,Loud & Lame,"My daughter and I both thought this movie was just not up to par with some of the earlier Barbie movies. Stick with the 12 Danceing Princesses, Three Musketeers and the Perfect Christmas. Skip this one."
2,Not Thumbelina at all....,"This is not remotely the story of Thumbelina. This is the story of the 'twillerbees', s small race that can magically make things grow - their life is idyllic until some greedy capitalists with a spoiled-rotten daughter decide to bulldoze the twillerbee's meadow to build a factory.I have to say that this movie made me angry because I feel like it was a bait-and-switch. Instead of an anticipated Barbie updated fairytale classic, I was given a tired cliche on the evils of wealthy business people who just want to destroy the earth......."
1,Thumbelina? Really? This is a marketing tool! Going to the landfill!,"We bought this dvd thinking it would entertain our twin 2 yr olds-- as always. Boy were we sorely disappointed with this ""green"" environmentally friendly piece of crap! ""Get em while they're young and their parents are asleep!"" This must be their motto. Now I am mad they got my hard earned cash for their bait and switch dvd! Talk about programming young minds for the whole ""green"" bandwagon---all that is ""green"" is the greenbacks going into all the elite's (like Al Gore) wallets! I can't believe people believe this load of garbage that is being spoon fed to them, and to make things worse now they are cramming this down the throats of children--not my kids! Nice try jackasses, this is one mother and father that is paying attention."
1,Spoiled Rotten,"Awful- I am glad I rented it before buying it. Not a good story about thumbelina, the daughter character is spoiled rotten, the friends are obnoxious brats, the parents are ridiculous- ""we'll give you whatever you want, dear"" This is not a good role model movie at all, no lessons learned other than how to act spoiled and rotten! SKIP THIS ONE- I wish I had never let my daughter, age 6 watch it."
1,a marketing ploy,"In short, do not buy this movie. We got it since it seemed similar to Tinkerbell, which our 4 year old loves (and we do too), and because of the Thumbelina name. But ever since purchasing this movie, my 4-year old daughter is walking around the house imitating the words and tone of the rich kid snobs in this movie. We are very careful in teaching our daughter to use nice words and to speak in a kind manner. I winced every time I heard the dialogue - including a few choice phrases by Thumbelina.It is a total rip-off of the Thumbelina name. This movie is already in the donation pile."
1,tree huggers only,"This is not your normal, entertaining Barbie movie. It has a definite point of view. Development is bad. Eco-terrorism is okay to save a tree. If you want to brainwash your kids, buy this movie. Our copy is hitting the trash."
5,My daughter loves this movie!,"My three year old daughter loves this movie and watches it often. She giggles throughout the movie. My daughter finds some of the Barbie movies too scary, but this one didn't have any scary parts. At first my daughter was worried that the bulldozers would be scary, but they were not."
4,Classic fairy tale with twist,Barbie in the classic fairy tales are the best.Don't have the girl waiting helpless or not thinking for herself.Wonderful movies for your little Princess.
4,Very Helpful. I've watched it repeatedly,"There aren't a whole lot of sea kayak videos out there to choose from, so there's not a lot to compare this to. However, I do highly recommend this video. It covers a lot of ground (or water, if you prefer); and it does it in a very helpful way. It covers the basics and even some more advanced topics. It's important to note that you can't really learn any of these techniques by watching a video. You can only do that by getting out on the water and paddling. However, good videos like these help you when you're out there by clueing you in to the kinds of techniques you should be learning; and helping you to visualize the motions as you're practicing them."
4,Nicely Presented!,"The video was very informative, well paced for the beginner as well as those of us that need a 'kayaking fix' in the cold weather. It provides clear, concise instruction/review. I will probably wear it out!"
1,go somewhere else if you want a soccer ball,"These are cheap, chinese junk rubber balls. They do not have 32 panels as stated, rather the rubber is imprinted to resemble panels - there is only one seam on these balls where the rubber is fused - they are NOT a soccer ball - and it seems that they should not be allowed to call them such - not a good value at any cost"
1,"OK for very light, gentle use","I bought both sets of these (SAE and metric) about a year ago. Both sets have seen moderate use around the home and shop. Might pull them out once a month or so. After using one size two or three times the T handles will begin to slip. The Allen wrench portion is just embedded in the plastic handle. So the frequently used sizes quickly become relatively useless except with vice grips. Nice idea, poor execution."
5,Battlestar Fan,"If you're in to Battlestar Galactica, you will love this CD. Even if you're ""not"" in to Battlestar, you might like it, too. Season 2 was one of my favorites so this is the only audio CD I have from the series. It plays quite frequently in my home office (much to the chagrin of my wife, who's tired of hearing it)."
5,Beautiful ! ! !,"I've seen most of the episode that this soundtrack was composed for so I thought that I knew what I was getting when I purchased this but what I got has completely surpased my expectations... To be as honest as one can be, I would have to say that Battlestar Galactica has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard."
4,Moody and Moving,"I've been pining for this album ever since Final Cut aired. When the original Galactica theme burst into fanfaire as the ""Colonial Anthem"" at the end of the episode, I was sold! It's a very moody soundtrack with some great and iconic BSG music."
5,An evolution beyond compare,"This iteration of the Battlestar Galactica soundtrack series is, so far, the best. In fact, I'm convinced this is one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard, for film or TV. First - the variety of styles from episode to episode involves a lot more string and guitar arrangements than did season 1, yet they all still maintain a cohesive thread that binds them together. The taiko drums depicting the deep, dark, quiet solitude of space are still there, and very prominently on a couple of tracks. The refinement of the opening credits theme song, which appears 2nd to last on the disc, fits nicely... and provides a nice gap between the main part of the soundtrack, and the killer finale - a heavy guitar laden tour de force written for the Black Market episode.I'm already eagerly aniticpating what Bear will create for Season 3, and after watching the first two episodes, I'm all ready to pre-order the Season 3 soundtrack!"
5,My Favorite So Far.....,"One of my favorite cd's. Of the 3 ""new"" series cd's, season 2 is the best so far.I can't wait for the release of Season 3."
5,Fantastic,"Well, the music from BSG is fantastic in general, but this album was particularly wonderful, in my opinion. I really love Prelude to War, such a moving peace, the huge drums going off like cannons and the astounding strings just blew me away. I also really liked Baltar's Dream, Martial Law, amongst many others. I definitely recommend this soundtrack."
4,A Perfect Companion,"The soundtrack to Battlestar Galactica Season 2 is one of the better television/movie soundtracks of recent years. Throughout the album you can hear the storylines and arcs of season 2 with the use of musical hooks and themes. While almost all the songs are good some of the stand-out tracks are A Promise To Return, Something Dark Is Coming, Roslin And Adama and Prelude To War. Roslin And Adama is by far my favourite piece, if annoyingly short. Its uplifting refrain is hard pressed to top. All in all a good buy for its emotional pieces as well as its status as companion to the series."
4,Not just for teens!,"I don't always treat my face as well as I should- makeup, humid weather, and smog aren't friends to my complexion. But this line by L'Oreal is a true and trusty companion. I first found the astringent over two years ago, and when I ran out, I stupidly bought whatever random Olay astringent on hand at the nearest drug store. When I finally did wise up and buy more L'Oreal Pure Zone my face thanked me almost immediately. My skin feels firm and fresh, and the light fragrance is an added bonus. This astringent is powerful enough to really clean my most troublesome pores, but doesn't overdry. I use the entire Pure Zone line. L'Oreal aims it at teenagers, judging by their website, but I find this product line perfect for a busy woman in her mid twenties. Your face will glow so nicely, you may even be tempted to skip your foundation on the weekends!"
1,Not worth my time!,"After reading all raving reviews I hurried to buy this book. Well, I was genuinely disappointed. Not only the plot was predictable, it was just as improbable. You would expect that a 40-something y.o. Executive knows his rights and is aware of existing laws in this country. I couldn't help thinking that some book chapters were intended for an ""Idiot Guide on how to handle a blackmail"". So don't waste your time on this book.If you like smart suspense, look up the author - John Sandford. He does far more superior job with his main character -detective Lucas."
4,A good book with a few problems,"I enjoyed the quick flowing prose of Derailed. I recommend this book for anyone. It has violence, sex, suspense and plenty of twists and turns. In fact, there are several twists and turns and I think Seigel could've done a better job revealing the final twist. It would have had a bigger impact.As one review wrote, there is a incredibly ridiculous turn of events towards the end of the novel that spurs the novel in a different direction. Still, I overlooked this event. I wasn't going to let it ruin my perception of the book.As a woman, I read a lot of books, mostly written by men, that present the aspect of a man cheating on his wife. Derailed presents the same dilemma of Charles Schine cheating on his wife, yet at the same time knowing it is the worst thing he could ever to to her, or to himself. The rest of the book explores how far Schine will go to protect is wife, even after he has done the ultimate act to destroy her."
2,"Too much hype, not enough delivery!","While I did finish the book, I found it too predictable and too far fetched. Also, too many typos, and too many facts not thoroughly checked."
2,Passable....,"I took this book with me on an ER visit, and the wait to see the doc lasted longer than it took to read this quick read.There are some plot twists and plot devices that are nicely done. But the characters are essentially unlikable, and there are too many unrealistic, improbable and/or deus ex machina events to make this overly-quick read a good book."
1,Not very Passable,"Frank, from California, and I agree (I to a lesser degree) about this book. A friend had written asking me what I thought of the book and I used the phrase ""deus ex machina"" in my review.I have read that Clive Owen is to star in the movie and, as I read, I kept thinking of Don Knotts. I did not care what happened to any of the characters.Glenda in Texas"
3,I won't have an affair now.,"Wow; if you were ever thinking of having an affair, you better read this book first. It's full of suspense and kept me guessing each chapter as to what would happen next. This could be a ""How To Book"" titled:""How to mess up you life."" I never saw the movie, but I really enjoyed this book."
1,Unbelievably Contrived,"I can't believe how ridiculous this book is. Although the author can put sentences together well, his plotting is absurd. The plot twist on page 250 was obvious around page 20 or so. The protagonist commits an enormous number of foolish acts. A plot device on page 300 is the classic example of the deus ex machina of a poor writer (or, since it involves a religiously motivated suicide bomber, perhaps it is a machina ex deus, either way, it is unworthy of a literate thriller).I approached this book with high hopes. Unfortunately they were dashed quite early.By the way, the movie was superior. It cuts out the flab and makes it a taut, gripping thriller."
1,Disappointing,"I was interested in this book since I read the flap on the hardcover. I was pleased when I saw it in paperback and picked it up. First off, from the beginning the dialogue is really bad. The flirting between the main character and the woman is really trite. The worst part of the book is halfway or 2/3 of the way through when something completely off the wall happens at the perfect time to save our hero. Throughout, cliches are used and acknowledged as though that forgives their use. It doesn't."
4,Wow!,"I'm not much of a reader, but I received this book as a gift. As a 16 year old female who doesn't enjoy reading all that much, this is a book I couldn't put down! I'd read a few chapters everynight from midnight...to 5am! I lost track of time and was so absorbed in the book.This book is definitly a goodie...I think it would be great as a movie too!"
4,A Pinch of Fatal Attraction; A Dab of Bruce Willis,"James Siegal's cautionary tale about a middle life crisis gone awry is just plain awesome and thoroughly entertaining. Charles Shine is an ordinary, bland 45 year old advertising executive who indulges in an elicit love affair with a beautiful women he meets by happen-chance on a commuter train. The story in a spectacularly violent fashion unravels from there, as Charles fights to reclaim his dignity, money and family.Dead bodies start to pile up and Charles Shine emerges as sort of kick ass kind of guy totally devoted to reaping a bloody revenge, but there is still something distasteful about his character. I guess I feel he brought all this disaster on himself, but I still enjoyed seeing him lay his traps for his enemies. A lot of things have to fall perfectly in place for this story to work, but even setting that aside, this is a read that you will race to finish."
1,o please spare me,"with all the hype, I couldn't wait to get my hand on an advanced copy of this one. the book started off slow, not the worst, not the best, still had promise, and then came the big ""twist"" which was a decent hook. That was where the novel finally came to life, then it just went downhill from there. I guess that's what happens when you leave it in the hands of a neophyte. Did anybody notice that contrived (and a major no-no) ""God from the machine"" that saved the character from a certain fate? Get real. That blew it for me. The protagonist remained weak from alpha to omega, not even capable of getting himself out of any situation with either strength or intelligence, just mere coincidence. The rest of the story was too predictable. The setup stank like a ten-day old dead man. It will be easy to spot for anyone who reads about cons and understands the life of grifters. And they spent a half-mil on marketing this? Amazing."
2,Off track ....,"The book moves swiftly, but it is predictable and formulaic. It is trying for the reader to understand the stupidity of the central character, Charles Schine. It lacks the ""Hitchcockian psychological twists"" which the book offers up to the reader in the back flap. The characters and situations are stale, mechanical, boring and unmoving.You have your femme fatale, the dutiful wife, the disinterested teenager, the ex-con, annoying co-workers, and the laughable villian, Vasquez. You have your comfortable Long Island suburban setting thrown against the sordid backdrop of NYC.(...)You read on, because you actually feel sorry for Charles - the same way you feel sorry for a lost puppy and hope he makes his way home."
1,If Howard Stern wrote mystery and suspense novels . . .,"this could be his style. I started reading this story with great anticipation and was thoroughly disgusted after the first few chapters. This has a great plot and surprise twist but you need to wade through the prose between the episodic violence. If you like sadism, this is your book. Rape? Got it! Human debasement and humiliation? Got it! Great writing? No. Good writing? Sometimes, but not often. I always finish books I start, and hate to skim. But if you read the first few chapers until you see what this is about, and then just look for ""Vazquez"" and read those scenes, you, like me, can finish this novel in about an hour and a half. Hey - that's probably what the screenwriter did!"
2,Ugh - What a Disappointment,"Sure, this is a page-turner. Suspenseful and exciting and you can read it in a day. But about half-way through the most ridiculous, improbable things happen (I'm being vague because I don't want to give away the plot).Of course, it's a thriller and I understand the context. But its twists and turns are so ridiculous that it just falls apart and I lost interest.If you want a quick, fun read, go ahead. If you want a really gripping page-turner, just read the first half."
4,Gripping,"Derailed is an excellent, gripping page turner about a man whose life it turned upside down when he takes a later train to work one day. He meets a woman on this later train, and has an affair with her. In what may be seen as a thinly veiled homage to marital fidelity, our heroes life quickly spirals into hell as he attempts to consumate this affair. Murder, bribery, embezzlement, the list of evils he must face go on and on. While reading the book, I thougth I figured out where Siegel was headed--I was both right and wrong. I don't want to give away anything, but suffice it to say, the plot took interesting, unexpected and intriguing (yet still plausible) turns. Derailed is a clever, engaging story. You really won't be able to put it down. Enjoy."
4,Derailed,"Derailed is a great book to read during a weekend. Just when you think you know the way the plot is going, it changes. It'svery entertaining and a quick read. I would not hestitate to recommend this book."
4,"The ""coincidences"" or lucky breaks don't hurt the book","This book reads extremely quickly and has a great ending.The lucky breaks/coincidences that everyone nags about are really serve to either advance the plot or put the guy in even more danger.The BIG lucky break only opens the story up to even more twists.Very satisfying read...you'll figure out some of it, but it goes so fast you won't care."
5,HBO must make this into a movie.,"I just finished this book and my heart is still racing. At first, I thought it was going to be about the typical mid-life crisis that seems to happen to the shallow, bored, yuppie type characters that have too much money and not enough commitment to their familes. In fact, I was just ready to close it and take it back to the library. (I always feel compelled to read a book even if I don't like it, feel like I am disloyal to the author.)I decided to read another chapter and on page 53, wow, the story began to explode and I was drawn into it and could not put it down. It has so many unpredictable twists and turns that make it one of the best books I've read in since Mystic River."
4,Great read,"This is a story you've seen many times in Hollywood movies. Nonetheless, Siegel's writing keeps you in suspense and you absolutely cannot put this book down until the end."
3,I liked the movie better...,"This is one of those rare instances where I liked the movie more than I did the book. Probably because I have the hots for Clive Owen and he made the main character, Charles, more likeable. Because in the book I didn't really like old Charlie at all - even when he redeemed himself in the end. Here's an ordinary guy with a great family and a good job, who becomes involved with another woman and gets caught (literally) with his pants down. A ruthless blackmailer sees a prime opportunity and proceeds to exploit it - which stupid Charles goes along with - up to a point. That's when Charlie gets a new set of cujones and things really get interesting. PS - this book is pretty graphic in detail, so don't read it if you are easily offended."
3,"Not bad, not exceptional","This book presents Charles Schine, a true weasel of a main character who cheats on his wife and then expects sympathy for getting in trouble over it. Charles is definitely not the brightest bulb in the box, but the extortion he faces makes for some strong tension and conflict. Overall, a decent read with one glaring blunder: a simply preposterous deus ex machina that saves Charles' life. Not to spoil it for you but imagine you're about to get broadsided by a speeding Hummer and an angel miraculously soars down on wings and lifts you to safety. What happens in this book at one of the most pivotal moments of conflict is just that absurd. Siegel's editor must have been taking a snooze!"
3,See the train coming,"That's the gimmick you see, way down the track. And I would have stayed with it, except for the unbelievable ""Deus ex machina"" thrown in to save our flawed hero. Nice try. But try again."
4,Excellent and scary,"I picked this book at the library discount counter and I'm glad I did. The story was great and I loved the way he organized the book. I read his bio somewhere and he says he collects news stories for book ideas and part of this really occured somewhere. Scary! A great pageturner. I look forward to seeing the movie.Anthony Wilbon, Author of ""The Enigma of Njama"""
2,Deus ex machina - A big No-No,"A good portion of James Siegel's Derailed is well-written and innovative. Especially, his serpentine back and forth parallel narrative between the prison and the main story.Some of his characterizations are good, i.e. Lucinda Harris and a few minor characters. Other characters, i.e. Charles Schine and Vasquez are less realistic. There isn't much depth to their personalities.Siegel's prose is smoothe-flowing and there are a few nice plot twists along the way.However, as other reviewers have stated, about two-thirds into the book, Siegel throws in a deus ex machina that is so unfair it is virtually insulting to the reader. Mr. Siegel's English teacher probably forgot to tell him that, when our hero gets in an insurmountable bind, you can't have the hand of God reach down, pick him up, and whisk him away to safety.Unless it's a cartoon."
5,A pictorial book,"A very well documented book. The one thing that sets this book apart from other books written on Mesopotamia are the photos and diagrams. If you are looking for a detailed show-me view of Mesopotamian archeaology and history then this is the publication for you. All of the cultural atlas series are well developed in a visional sense for the reader. The topics covered in this book begin from the origin of agriculture through the Persian empire, with all the archaeological evidence and written history inbetween. I recommend this book for every library, weither your highly interested in Mesopotamia or it's just a fancy. Buy it and you will not regret the purchase."
4,Good Overview,"I enjoyed this book, and plan to peruse it often. I purchased an inexpensive used copy, and it was in good condition. It is an Atlas, as titled, with plentiful artifact and architecture pictures, maps, etc. on almost every page. The timeline starts in Epipaleolithic and goes through the Iron Age. The text provides a lot of fairly detailed information about the Sumerian, Babylonian and Assyrian cultures and history without being overly tedious."
5,Some GOOD AIR,"I perchased this filter back in February and just got around to installing it. It was so easy! My car has only 24k on it and is 4 years old, but my filter looked real crappy for that age. The old one came out all messed up. It had dirt, sand and a whole dead oak leaf in the filter. I was also getting some funky smells. NOW...no more smells. I will only say to put some good smelling oil drops on the filter to satisfiy the wife!"
5,SO I think you'll be rolling on the floor THEN,Has to be the best Minnesota humor book ever. If you ever have vacationed in Minnesota for any length of time -- this book is a heckuva deal for you!
4,A slice of Midwestern American life,"This will make most people laugh at least a little at some of the ridiculous truths about folks from Minnisota.Being from the north and somewhat west (Rochester NY) I know people just like the ones this audio describes and can relate to how they act and how they interact with one another. Like the advice one guy gives to another vs. the advice one guy gives to a gal. Check out the ""If a guy..."" sketch its hilarious. Or the description of ""A little lunch"" neither little nor at lunch. Usually served with a ""hot dish"" which typically requires mixing in a can of mushroom soup.After hearing this I'm ready to venture into the wilds of Minnisota."
4,Jim's Review - Not too bad.,"I love this video. It should be watched with someone who speaks minnesotan, and they will tell you how true to life it is. It has motivated me to practice my minnesotan so I can speak to my sister-in-law who is a native. I know I am doing well when she doesn't even notice when I slip a little minnesotan into the conversation. I hear that it is available in video stores in Mnpls. It's a good deal if you can find it."
3,A FUN BOOK THOUGH IT LEAVES SOME QUESTIONS UNANSWERED,"A fun, easy-to-read look at life in Minnesota and how to get along when visiting or moving there. It does leave one questioning the accuracy of all the author has written as most of seems more ""tongue in cheek"" than real. So, if you are looking for some chuckles reading about the idiosyncrasies of living, traveling, visiting, and dining in Minnesota, this is a good start; but, don't consider it a genuine travel guide."
2,Loved it!!,I was raised in Minnesota and this book reminded me of the things I used to say and hear. Great book that will have you laughing to the end!
1,i just don't get it.....,"I've been living in Minnesota for 14 years and consider myself a Minnesotan. I married a Minnesotan, and I know many, many Minnesotans. None of them are the dim-witted, non-expressive, unexitable simpletons that this book makes them out to be. This book is chock full of stereotypes, and I, personally, don't want people from all over the country to think that this is how all Minnesotans are. I found this book insulting."
3,too bad it's cut,"I remember having this as an LP set on Musical Heritage a couple decades ago and thought it rather good then. Ok, it's a bit on the slow side but that's Lombard. The soloists are all fine but this has 20 minutes of music cut out so it's hard to get a full feel for it. Erato needs to release this complete. Until then, I'd have to say not to get this abridgement."
3,headlights,"headlights arrived safely packaged. they looked great and crystal clear lens.only one issue,the tabs that hold light was a fraction too short. had to send then back."
3,2003 Impala headlight...,"I purchased a pair of headlights, this review is for the drivers side unit. I had to return the first one because it filled with water the first time we had snow melt. The replacement came quickly, and installed without problems. So far it is working well, no water getting in it. Simple to install, you will want to adjust the headlights when you get it in. New headlights made the car look much better..."
4,"Short tabs, but good headlight","Had to jury-rig the headlight in because the corner tab was too short, but it works as intended. Certainly better than buying it from the dealership."
1,Always Moisture.,"I had a bad connection inside the stock headlight assembly, and without any way to fix it without otherwise destroying the unit, I bought this. While it looks great out of the box, clear glass and all (contrasting with the other stock unit enough I went ahead and bought it's pair), I've had incredible trouble with moisture in this unit. From about day 2 on, it is always fogged up or filled with water. ALWAYS. In the morning, after driving for hours, at night, in dry weather, in wet weather, it doesn't matter, its wet inside this headlight. Will be returning as soon as I get another brand."
5,Nikon 8218 binoculars,We have been using these binoculars for some time now and it works great. We had a similar pair like this but misplaced it on a trip to Hawaii so I'm sure someone is enjoying it too. We like it for it's small size and wonderful optics. Easy to adjust too.
2,Short SIX TRACKS.,"I downloaded this album after reading the page for Supergrass Is 10: Best of 94-04 the CD and naturally assumed it, being an album of the same name, would have the same tracks. This download is 6 tracks short of what you get on the CD. A Supergrass compilation without ""Pumping on Your Stereo?"" Criminal, which is exactly what this download is."
5,Ive liked this band for a long time :),"Everyone who writes in here says ""im surprised they werent big in america"" but the fact that alot of people from america are writing in about supergrass says that they did have some impact here. And I kind of like it that they didnt go mega mainstream even though I think they deserved it :) At least you wont hear your favorite supergrass tunes messed with and stuck into dumb commercials. Anyways this music is connected with great memories for me (going to dance clubs,high school and college memories,partying to supergrass and the other bands that were lumped together with them at the time) and definatly worth listening to for the fan and new person alike....The later albums got more serious as they grew up but the earliest albums are the best because they are so goofy and fun-loving :) If you like fun music Supergrass are for you."
4,Good Fun Music With A Catchy Beat,"Supergrass is simply fun, rhythmically compelling music with a prominent sense of humor, put together with a lot of musical skill and studio savvy. The best track is ""Kiss of Life"", a somewhat Talking Heads-like song which is alone worth the price of admission. The rest of the songs here are not in that style but are just as good. Nothing deep here from these Brits, but there's always early Genesis if you're in that mood. This is '90's fluff elevated to its ultimate tongue-in-cheek best and given its most clever and flavorful incarnation."
2,Shortchanged on the digital version,"As noted by another reviewer, if you choose the MP3 version you will only get 15 songs, not the 21 the album in all forms is supposed to have. I'm not sure what the excuse is, but its really ridiculous. Its not even very clear since the MP3 version is linked right on the same page that lists the 21 tracks.Great band, bad choice by whoever decided to shortchange the digital buyer."
2,I must be missing something here,"I know it's very unfair to judge a group by a ""best of"" hits compilation, but this is all of I've heard of the group -- and all I want to hear. There are a couple of good tracks but the rest wanders between the boring and the quite dreadful. Listening to the singer trying to stay in tune during the final song -- Wait for the Sun -- is truly painful, rather like watching a drunk at night reaching out in a bid to catch the moon. There's nothing I've heard here which would even remotely make me want to buy any of this group's albums. Sorry, but there it is. My taste in weird and off-beat bands tends more to ""They Might Be Giants"", a duo which indeed makes Supergrass look litle more than musical pygmies. Listening more closely to this CD, I detect pretty blatant undertones from bands such as Fischer Z and Steve Harley and the Cockney Rebels."
3,A Marketing Plan,"After the Ball appears to have been the seminal blueprint for the gay rights movement in the US. Kirk and Madsen lay out their strategy - which has worked quite well - for converting the culture to one that was primary antagonistic toward gays, at the time of their writing, to one that is now much more accepting. I say it worked well, since we are now talking about same-sex marriage with nearly 1/2 the population being on board.The thing that disturbed me a bit, was that their strategies were based more on marketing concepts rather than arguments from logic. This seems to leave some potential for regression unless the logic portions can be strengthened over time."
1,methods to manipulate public opinion,"As a summary of methods to manipulate and control opinion, this book is an example of how to achieve a goal (public opinion modification), without recourse to fact, reason, or fair play. A propagandists dream, it is best summed up in two of its own quotes ""Thus propagandistic advertising can depict all opponents of the gay movement as homophobic bigots who are 'not Christian' and the propoganda can further show them as being criticized, hated and shunned}"".... ""Our effect is achieved without reference to facts, logic or proof.... the person's beliefs can be altered whether he is conscious of the attack or not"" (p. 152-153) Answers questions as to how a group of less then 2% of the population, can attain political and media clout completely out of proportion to their size or condition"
5,Thrilled,"This book was in great shape when it arrived, and it arrived with two other books I ordered. I love that the seller sent them all together that way, so I wasn't waiting as they came one by one. I love this book series, it's one of my favorites, and I'm glad I found copies of each indiviudal volume. Somewhere along the line the publishing company took the first two books and the last two books and combined them into 2 volumes instead of four. It's disappointing because we don't get the great artwork the individual books get. It took me FOREVER to find them separate like this! I'm so excited to have these!"
5,A wonderful story,"The young heroine in this book is terrific. Kellogg avoids the usual cliches - this kid isn't the flirty self-centered brat or the rough and tumble tomboy that inhabit so many fantasy novels. Young Erde is thoughtful. We are watching her mature as the story unfolds. The dragon isn't typical either. Each peril they encounter feels real, not simply convienent to the plot, and magic is not the ultimate solution. The ending is touching and leaves you hungry for the next book in the series. When is that, by the way? I'm starving by now"
3,"Entertaining and well written, but shoddily edited","The first of four books in the series displays a world that resembles medival Europe. The girl Erde discovers she is a dragon guide and the story is an entertaining adventure romp with the usual goodies and baddies thrown in. Characters are believable, the plot works well.A major drawback is the sheer laziness of author and editor who never bothered to check if the supposedly German that gets used for names and in conversation is credible of even correct. Unfortunately is is neither and after a couple of hundred pages it gets to be a major annoyance.A good story, great characters that do not deserve to be let down like this."
3,Decent but not accurate description,"We paid thirty dollars for this on amazon. One reason we choose it was that it said it weighed in .03 ounce increments - which it doesn't. It weighs in .05 ounce increments. Guess that's what happens when you buy online. The scale is extremely flimsy feeling, and requires a stable surface like a kitchen counter - it won't work on our table which sits on a wood floor. But it seems to work fine - we don't have the problem the other reviewer had with it taking a minute or longer to zero. Decent product for what we paid."
5,A truly outstanding presentation of Oaxacan folk ceramics,"Having been to Oaxaca approximately ten times in the past 20 years, I can appreciate the quality and beauty of this fine book. The reasonable price of this ""paperback"" belies its perfect format/size and its gorgeous photography, text and printing quality.I've rarely been satisfied with ""crafts"" books, but this one has been so perfectly written and executed, that it makes me want to jump on a plane and immediately fly to Oaxaca, to find and meet the fantastic artists presented here.I met one of these women several years ago (Angelica Vasquez), and this glorious book will create an urge in many of its readers to meet her and the other artists that are included here."
4,Oaxacan Ceremics,"This is a fine new book focussing on about a half-dozen female ""folk"" artists in Oaxacan, Mexico. They all work in ceremics and have their own styles. The book provides interesting information about the women's lives and some background on their techniques. I would have like more information on how they make or conceptualize a piece, how they paint them, and what the ""business"" of selling their work is like, but this is still a good introduction to this field (not to be mistaken for the Oaxacan woodcarving that is also popular). Plenty of color illustrations, recommended."
5,Stunning photos,I know little about Oaxacan ceramics but was immediately drawn to this book by the unbelievably beautiful photos. many of the shots are done outside using natural lighting and it gives the pieces a lifelike feel that I find wonderful. And the creativity of the pieces themselves! A wonderful introduction to one type of Mexican craft.
1,Why go to LA to create terrible acting and writing?,"The entire premise of this episode is well worn and cliched. The relationships between the cops and attornies seemed forced at best, uncomfortable at the very least. The writing, quite poor, seemed impossible to pull off even by as fine an actor as Peter Coyote (I mean, without being too much of a spoiler, the politics card? Already? I guess LAites just don't care about justice!)I think this franchise has seen its day. The producer and creator must be wealthy enough by now to start on some other project. This episode is just sad, poorly done and a waste of time to watch. Credit where credit is due: the closing credits music was nice."
4,Love it,I JUST LOVE ITT. RIGHT DOWN THE BOOK. LAW AND ORDER IS MY FAV.I NISS SKEET. GREAT GREYSGreat!
1,Uncle! Same plots and relationships just with palm trees,"There are no surprises in this Law and Order series with predictable plots and characters except for a little more sunshine, LA location wise. Now that ""Criminal Intent"" is off the air and ""SVU"" has become wooden, that is, everyone is phoning in their performances, I don't see this West Coast version coming up with anything fresh. After a lot of years, I am crying ""Uncle!"". Not even $1.99 per episode can entice. I would rather be reading a good book."
5,I love this watch !,"This is my first ever Citizen watch and I love it. It is a beautiful piece at a great price. Need to read the instructions to set it up, not very complicated. Very elegant, nicely done wrist band."
1,Terrible,I ordered this dvd in june and i didnt get it until august! i had to write them to get them to send it over a month later. once i got the dvd it was scratched all the heck. do NOT buy from them!!!
3,Another mediocre romance...,"Lord Avery's Legacy is far from unique with it's family in finacial ruin combined with unwanted attention from a 'gentleman' plot line. It wasn't as fast-paced or well-written as the better romance novels I've read. Even so, it was an amusing read."
4,Great Cover Art,"This little rock-a-billy gem full of newer bands that are still rockin'Some really good tracks on here and worth a listen, if you like todays Rock-A-Billy sounds.Great Cover art!The Mean Eyed CatKNON 89.3Dallas, Texas"
2,Not tops in its class,"Just remember, this is not a comprehensive work and you will have to constantly review the bibliography and look things up. The writing can be wordy and difficult to understand. Not a top choice of mine for nursing theory."
4,nursing students who need theorists,for any nursing student who needs a detailed source for nursing theorists this is the book to get. I purchased this book when I was required to come up with a different theorist each week to link with my clinicals that I was doing. It made the job much easier and I didn't have to repeat any of the theorists the entire semester.
3,Very good condition,I received this book a lot faster than anticipated and it was in very good condition. It almost looked brand new.
2,It was required,"Only used it because it was required. Good info I guess, would not just sit down and read it. Helped with school project."
2,Everything but . . .,"An exceedingly strange production: it is really not about Colt's Single Action Army Revolver, but instead associated but irrelevant phenomenon, i.e., Italian clones (who cares?), Rugers (who cares?), forgotten celebrities who were once photographed carrying Colts (who really cares?) It's all there except for, er, you know, the SUBJECT OF THE BOOK, on which, alas, there's very little. It's as if the compositor lost a set of six or eight chapters somewhere and the publishers hoped nobody would notice. When I finished paging through it, I thought, Yes, but where's the stuff on the famed sixgun?"
2,Not a book on Colt SAAs,"This was one of,if not the worst, book on Colt SAAs I have ever bought. It appears as a compilation of articles from monthly publications. It has very little info on older, original SAAs. There is lots of stuff on shooting modern replicas and there is not much depth there either. I was very disappointed."
4,Review,"Nice waffle iron. I burnt the first batch...and it was a little hard to clean, but that's my fault. Cute impressions!"
5,"perfect size for toaster waffles, quality so far good.","This waffle iron works well with my waffle recipes.The waffles bake evenly and quickly.The surface is non-stick if the recipe has enough fat/oil in it (this is why often the waffle version of a recipe will call for more fat/oil than the pancake version).Or one can use a thin coat of oil on the cooking surface, and use less fat in the waffle batter.I tried both with and without oil on the cooking surface.The waffles are just the right size for making toaster waffles. I can freeze them, and then use them as toaster waffles."
4,Easy to use and clean,"The item arrived very quickly. As other reviewers said, it takes about 3 minutes per waffle (2 waffles actually) which is a bit long if you are cooking for a big family. The waffles are quite thin and crispy, my kids like that. The waffles are also not evenly done - this is something I personally don't like but so far the middle section of the waffles has been turning out darker than the edges. The bottom part of the waffles looks nicer - and hence it becomes the top when you serve them, the top is kind of smudged. There's no temperature control - you just have to keep the waffles longer if you like them darker. I had no issues with overpouring - it's quite easy if you follow the instructions. Easy to clean as well. Overall, I would recommend this to a family with kids who like the characters."
2,A lot of coughing,"The performance of the orchestra under Sinopoli is fine. However, there is a lot of coughing that disrupts the pleasure of the listener. This is a live performance, but there are scores of live recordings without or with minimal coughing from the audience. This is true even for many old recordings. Given the advances in technology, this large amount of coughing is unforgivable in a modern cd."
2,Music of stupendous banality,"I was naive to try this CD--how good can the Dante Sym. be if major Lisztians have resolutely avoided it, including Karajan, Bernstien, Haitink, Rattle, and Horenstein? Each has recorded the Faust Sym. and/or the major tone poems. Liszt provides a moody, if concocted sense of doom in the first movement Inferno and a sugary choral Magnificat in the last movemnt Paradiso, but the symphony as a whole feels like an endless stay in Purgatorio, even though that's just the middle movement. Sheer claptrap, even for Liszt.The Busoni filler is no great shakes, either, being almost as melodically uninspired as the Liszt and with little advance in orchestral technique. Sinopoli conducts with commitment; the Dresden orchestra plays beautifully. The live audience coughs too much, but who cares? The music itself is so stupendously banal that doing it well or badly hardly counts."
5,So funny...loved it,total spoof. you will not be disappointed. 420 friendly. Me and my friends were laughing for hours after. Watch it!
1,Really bad movie!,"My husband and I got this movie thinking it was sort of like Vampire Sucks, which wasn't half bad, but when we watched Breaking Wind, it was so bad and vulgar that I still can't believe I went to the whole thing. There is not even one scene that's worth watching, it really is bad. I love to laugh, I love movies that make fun of other movies, but this one wasn't it, it really is so bad I really don't recommend it to any one. It was a waste of money, but most of all a waste of time. It is just plain garbage, believe me, not worth wasting your money on it."
2,Not for tweeners.,"I rented this movie after being begged by my 12 year old grandaughter and her sleepover friend of the same age, they are both, suprise, fans of the Twighlight movies, and thought this movie spoof would be fun to watch. The first five minutes dipicted a fairly graphic oral sex scene, which prompted me to switch channels. So I did not watch the remainder of the movie."
2,"Should be ""some things"" low carb","Some of the recipes in this book are keepers, but a lot of them make you wonder if they've really thought through the low-carb idea. For instance, there's a recipe for ""Glazed Bananas."" Bananas by themselves are off-limits for most low-carbers, but this recipe suggests adding honey to the mix. At 20 carbs per serving this treat is described as ""moderate.""Nutritional reporting is minimal. No calorie counts are reported for recipes. Carb counts include fiber, and fiber is not reported on its own, so good luck figuring out net impact carbs.Dana Carpender's 500 Low-Carb Recipes is a much better bet."
4,The secrets of Taoism are concisely and clearly explained.,"This book gives an excellent introduction to the Taoist-martial art way of life and includes the Three Treasures, proper diet, life-theory, and Taoist health excercises. This is a companion book to the semi-fictional 'The Wandering Taoist' series, also by Deng Ming-Dao"
3,Great Chi Kung Pictures!,"Although the immortal Taoist studies may be a little beyond what most readers are looking for, this book has a wonderful collection of Qigong exercises with very effective action-comic style pictures. Those plus the fascinating food section (with very nice b&w; photos) together assure that it is a beautiful book.As a student of Taijiquan and internal martial arts, I find this book a great resource."
3,For small hands,I borrowed this machine from a friend to try out before making the purchase. The machine itself is very nice. There is an on/off switch and ready light which is also the button you push to make the lid open on a hinge. It took two hours for the two pounds of wax to melt most of the way. (Enough so that we could dip our hands in) My husband could not put his hand in without curling his fingers and I had to be very careful. My gloves size is an 8.There is no way a foot could be dipped but the description does not suggest you can. I think there might be better choices out there.
4,Soothing heat therapy,"Paraffin treatment does not cure arthritis, but it provides comfortable deep heat therapy and relief from the pain in my hands. It's great for dry skin in the winter! This model has worked well for me, altho a temperature regulator would be helpful."
4,This is great!,"The whole pure zone set works like a dream, but it is very hard to come by in drugstores, so kudos to Amazon! I find that you get better results when you use all three steps together. I also recommend buying both the foaming and scrub version of step 1."
1,I couldn't turn it on either.,"I don't know if Amazon keeps shipping the same broken scale or what, but mine would not turn on either. I returned it."
1,Nice scale.....but,"Very nice looking scale. Unfortunately it would not turn on no matter what I tried. Battery was good, so it is evidently a bad switch."
5,Great DVD,I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to learn to roll. It teaches a basic roll and breaks it down into its different components.
4,The Kayak Roll,"Simply stated, if you want to learn how to roll a WW kayak, go no further than this video. It breaks down the roll into its component parts, both for instruction before the fact and diagnosis & corrections after the fact. It pinpoints all the little nuances of this necessary WW skill, right down to hand and eye positions, and does so in a fashion that is upbeat and inspiring. You want to run right out to the pool and practice!That the video features average people - not kayak superstars - permits the viewer to relate to each scene. My fiance and I both learned to roll 100% from viewing this video, over and over. We continue to use it as a reference tool, and have lent it to other people wanting to get into WW kayaking. Buy it - it's cheaper than a... private lesson, and just as effective, since you can repeat it as often as you want/need."
5,Gave Me Back My Roll!,"I ordered this video the day before I hit my face on a rock and got 8 stitches all because of a missed roll ... a little foreshadowing? I watched this video today, went out into the river to practice and bam! I'm back. Of course I've been collecting and practicing a whole host of bad habits all summer long which finally culminated in the complete destruction of my previously bomb proof roll. I can't believe how thorough this video is. One video was able to help me discern all the wrong things I was doing -- it is RockStar. thank you!!![...]"
1,Flat and Slow,"This was a suggestion from Amazon after I had been buying some Diana Krall CDs. What a disappointment! The music on here, by some of the jazz greats, sounds like funeral dirge -- no tempo, no melody! I am trying to get through it the first time on my car cd, but will probably never listen to it again."
3,"Decent reenactment, but video could have been so much better.","They had the funds to put together a decent reenactment, so why not add maps? Pictures during the time? It could have been so much more descriptive, instead it is just shots of solders firing at each other with a few lines of information every 5 minutes."
5,The kids really enjoyed these,"Good for kids. Wish TV shows today were more like the old days. Good, clean humor. Good for family night!"
3,She's growing up...,"Getting the chance to revisit my favorite childhood TV show, I'm really amazed at all of the deep issues Punky Brewster addressed, and how I can still remember the lessons I learned as a child. Out the 3 seasons released on DVD, I'd have to say Season 3 was my least favorite. There were a few episodes that were very moving, but as a whole, a lot of the episodes felt like ""filler"" episodes. The episode I was most impressed with was ""The Anniversary."" Seeing Cherie get healed by finally dealing with her anger and emotions brought me to tears. For every Punky Fan, I'd recommend getting this season just for the sake of having a complete collection...not for the special features or the depth of episodes!"
4,Good book.,"This book was the assigned reading material for my engineering technology course. Its primary purpose was to give us an `introduction' to fluid related concepts, and in that area I would say it was very successful. This books writing style is extremely easy to follow, and unlike some of my other textbooks was actually enjoyable to read. It provided step by step instructions on how to solve problems, and also offered more than enough problems for the students to solve themselves. The only issue I have with this book relates to the rather limited examples it provides. In its solutions it illustrates how to solve the simple problems, but negates to do the more complicated ones which sometimes left me clueless on how to proceed. This book is also rather expansive and does not go very deep into the subject.. If your looking for a good introduction book for your course, or some extra learning material this is a great choice. If you're a more advanced reader, I suggest you look elsewhere."
5,Excellent one as the first book for hydraulics,"If you haven't learned hydraulics before, it will be a perfect book for you to start. Need almost nothing background. The author have done really a great job in explaining things in a easy way. Every chapter only covers limited contents, it will sweep away my afraid and resistance to this major. But if you want to learn advanced hydraulics, please avoid this book."
1,Don't adapt for your course,"The book is very shallow and not worth considering for any engineering or any technical degree. it might be good for high school level pre-engineering classes, but difinetly not at college or university level."
5,Great little cones!,"Can't get green cones @ Lowes or Home Depot, and I don't know why. Their loss, Amazon's gain. I use them for ATV classes."
3,Linux Buyer Beware,"While this is a reasonable sound card for a budget, linux buyers looking for a ""modern"" SB-16 should look elsewhere. I bought this card to put in a low-profile linux box thinking that it would be based on the same chipset as the SB-16 and have support for hardware mixing. Long story short--this card is a dumbed down version of the Audigy card that only has software mixing. You can get this card to work under linux with some difficulty, but you will never get hardware mixing."
3,Overall its ok but not for gaming or reliability,"this soundcard came with my pc, the sound itself sounds nice but it is not meant for gaming. This card causes static in programs like ventrilio and teamspeak. i looked it up and there were said to be issues with programs similar and the soundcard. After having this card for 2 years its starting to die on me. my brandnew mic will stop working and sometimes sound comes out of one speaker only. so to summerize it if you want nice sound this will work, but for gaming and more reliability get something else."
4,A lot of bang for your buck,"Simple installation and huge improvement in stereo sound. You can't go wrong for under $29!The software was a little quirky for me, but everything ended up working fine. I wish I had installed this a couple of years ago. You can't get CD quality sound without a card like this."
4,Anti-War Film from the Vietnam War Era Celebrates the GI War Resistance Movement,"This film celebrates some forgotten history of the US Anti-War Movement.During the US war against Vietnam, GI war resistors organized an active anti-war resistance movement within their own military organizations. Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland (who played Hawkeye in the original M*A*S*H movie) were among those performers who toured the Pacific Rim to entertain and encourage GI war resistors.The film contains some hard-hitting and vibrant performances, showcasing local grass-roots musicians and reminding us how music unites, supports and energizes popular resistance movements."
2,FTA,This was a typical anti-vietnam war movie with Jane Fonda. I was curious as to its anti 1970's content. Watched the whole thing but to me it is not worth sharing with anyone.
2,FTA,"Vietnam Era Veteran. Was unaware that this movie was ever made. I was a bit busy, at the time. Knew what I was getting, when I purchased the movie, although I wasn't aware that Donald Southerland shared the same views.Political views were quite evident, but I was fighting for her right to say what she was saying, even though I might not have agreed with it. Some of it was funny to watch, but would not want to sit down and take the message seriously."
3,ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF THE MYSTERY REVEALED,"THE AUTHOR FAILS TO BRING UP THE STORY OF WILLIAM MILDIN, THE EARL OF STREATHAM, A CHILD WHO LIVED WITH ""APES"" AFTER BEING MAROONED ON THE AFRICAN COAST IN THE 1800'S---A SUPPOSEDLY TRUE STORY THAT BURROUGHS ""VAGUELY"" REMEMBERS READING. EVEN IF ERB DIDNT READ THIS TALE, ITS AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE THAT THIS STORY WAS PUBLISHED IN AT LEAST TWO SOURCES IN THE PERIOD BEFORE BURRROUGHS WROTE TARZAN."
4,passing of a trazan fan,saddly i report on the passing of sarkis atamian on 12/27/2005..after a long illness and being unable to finish origins #2...hail and farewell...ken humphreys
4,Flavorful documentary,"In the late sixties, John Harris captures the flavors of the past hidden inthe last sardine cannery to remain open through the eyes of two aging cannery workers who once knew the famous owner, Knut Hovden-- through an aging piano player in a house of ill repute haunted by a ghost-- and through the eyes of some runaway hippies and dance mimes who choose to live in the once prosperous (and oderous) fish packing house only to see it burn down after a few months. Artful, well photographed, it makes you wish the film could be so much longer."
5,A Really Good Book,I think this book was better than the first one(don't get me wrong because the first one was good too). If you have a best friend that has been your best friend for a long time then you can relate. I think a lot of other people will like this book too. I think Kristen Kemp is a very good writer! I can't wait to read number three!!!:)
5,Nicely done Karaoke CDG,My 7 year old daughter loves the Sound of Music and this CDG was perfect for her to sing along to with her Karaoke machine. The music and singing are nicely done.
2,Not for me,This DVD is also to fast paced and choreographed for me. It was frustrating trying to keep pace. It might appeal to anyone who wants a lot of choreography and every changing program.
3,OK I guess,"The only problem I had installing these bulbs was that they didn't install without a lot of twisting power. In other words, on certain sockets they didn;t just pop in, it took a lot of twisting to get them to turn to the 12 o'clock position. Once in though, they worked as expected."
4,Nice Toaster,"I've had my toaster for over a year now and I love it. It still plays the music and I've never had any problems with it. It did stink a little the first couple of times, but I think all toasters do that. If you like pooh this a good toaster!"
4,Technical and thorough,"If your intent is to create music *by synthesizing the tones with a computer*, with a program such as Csound, this book is invaluable. It is *not about sequencing*, looping, controlling synthesizers or samplers with MIDI, etc. That said, the serious treatment of various types of sound synthesis is more than adequately technical, with lots of flowcharts, diagrams and a little algebra. The flowcharts illustrate generically how sounds can be synthesized, without getting into the specifics of particular programs. You must be able to leap the gap between the concept and the realization in a particular computer music program. Other chapters nicely introduce psychoacoustics, fundamentals of digital audio and the use of sound processing methodology. Warning: For a person with little technical (engineering-type) background, the book will be tough going in places, possibly overwhelming. It is not an introductory-level text."
5,"if you are serious about electronic music, read this book.","this book is used as the textbook for electro-acoustic music courses world-wide, if you are an electronic musician, or a musician interested in sound synthesis and other electronic musical applications then this book is for you. if you want to learn more, buy this book. if you're happy twiddling virtual knobs on that shareware program of yours, don't even bother."
1,14 year old book....,I want someone to explain to me how a 14 year old book on a computer technology is going to be any worth...
2,Funny parts...but missed the mark overall...,"I liked Lynsay Sands' book, ""Love Is Blind"" (the only other book I'd read by her) so I decided to try this one. The plot idea is great - but Lynsay fails to make me care about the characters, especially Radcliffe or whatever his name was. (See how memorable he was to me!) I didn't really care whether they fell in love or not. In fact, I liked the secondary romance between Charlie's sister Beth and her suitor, Tommy, more than Charlie and Radcliffe. There were some funny parts in the story, so that's why I finished it, but the ending was pretty blah. I don't hate it, but it's not something I'll reread, and I'm sorry I wasted my money on it."
3,Nice for an easy Sunday read,"Clever plot, I did find myself wishing the author would get to the point and skipping ahead. That could be more a function of my impatience than anything else. I would recommend to fans of historical romance."
5,I kept getting funny looks for laughing so much.,"I enjoyed reading this book because it was everything wrapped up in a one book. It has romance,comedy,and excitement all wrapped up together! I would recommend this to everyone that likes to read! Keep it up Lynsay Sands!"
4,Really cute story,"This book is incredibly cute. If you enjoyed movies such as The Parent Trap, you'll probably like this book. :) The ending kind of dragged for me but overall, I would recommend it."
3,Pleasant and enjoyable romance novel.,"I debated between giving this 3 or 4 stars. When I finished reading it, my reaction was I liked it and I had no problems with it. That fits my definition of 3 stars. I wanted to give it more than 3, but I decided to stay with my initial reaction and definition.It's a fun story about twin sisters Beth and Charlie (Charlotte) who run away from their uncle who plans to sell them as brides. To reduce their chance of discovery, they dress as a boy and a girl, taking turns being the boy. Radcliffe is attracted to Charlie. He is in turmoil because he is sometimes drawn to the boy and other times drawn to the girl, not knowing it is the same person.Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: one. Setting: time not stated, probably 1800s England. Copyright: 1999. Genre: historical romance.For a list of my reviews of other Lynsay Sands books, see my 5 star review of ""Love is Blind"" posted 1-22-07."
3,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to reading this book after reading all of the 5 star reviews written about it, but I was disappointed in it, especially towards the end. I found the part where Radcliffe dresses as a woman to save Charlie ridiculous, and thought that their reunion after the chase to Gretna Green very anti-climactic. Also, I was looking forward to more interesting interplay between the two after Radcliffe found out Charlie's true identity. This was a fun book to read, but I think it could have been much better."
3,Not crazy about this one!,I always have loved Lynsay Sands books and bought this book strictly on the author's name alone. I was definitely disappointed. I think this book just pales in comparision to her other great books. I am giving it three stars because it didn't compare to her other works as far as character depth and story plot. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a more run-of-the-mill romance.
3,Predictable yet fun..,"Ya get the gist of this story right from the start...so...yeah, sometimes painfully predictable. The foundation is quite amusing and fast paced (you're reeled in quickly)...but the plot begins to unravel quickly with lots of ""huh's?""...and become's frikkin' dumb. I mean, WHY do these twins keep Radcliffe in the dark for so long? Criminy...there's just no plausible explanation! And Lord Radcliffe...I realize he's an English Gentleman of Nobility.. blah blah...but cripes...grow a pair Sir! Chew on rocks or somethin' if ya gotta.Humorous situations at time that still make this a page turner...but like I said, it unravels pretty frikkin' quick.(...why can't anyone break a frikkin' frakkin' window when you're being held prisoner with threat of death??...hmmmm??) Doesn't make much sense.But really...having said all THAT...still enjoyable and definitely worth three stars."
2,photo is different then product,"I wanted the one in the photo, it has 8 paper divisions and it is made from metal. The one I received has 4 divisions and it's made from plastic. This sale is very deceptive and I don't like it. If it was more then 5 bucks (which I would have happily paid for the one pictured) I would be returning it but it's just not worth it. I will be uploading a photo so people actually know what they're getting in the future. Shame on the seller."
1,Deceptive Advertising!!,"Like the other person who reviewed this item, I also wanted the sand paper rack that was pictured for sale. Instead I received a 4 compartment plastic bulky piece of $#!?. I'm pissed and will not buy from Amazon anymore!"
2,Remover,"doesnt work very well at all, you are much better off with an astablished bacteria setup, spend your money on bio rings and let your tank setup."
2,book review,"This book leaves much to be desired. I found myself wondering more than once if it was worth finishing. It was sooo slow. The cover says 'the most wickedly plotted medieval mystery novel"". I did not find that to be true. I might try another of his books, but it might be a awhile."
3,Personal Finance,Actually had to return book because the classes they had chose for me I didn't needto take this class since I had already completed before.
4,Owned since July 2004,"I have used this unit daily for almost 2 years now and have had no problems. Occasionally it has some quirks with inconsistent measures, but I usually just turn off the unit and measure again. Great for cooking and for measuring out an accurate serving size of packaged food."
1,Should have listened,I too purchased this scale after a good amount of research.It didn't work - right out of the box - it's going back. I should have listened to others who had the same problem
3,truth is stranger than fiction...,"Good plot and believeable story. It has all the right theories and the multitude of players; even Gen. Lansdale. The story, however did not flow smoothly."
1,california natural HAIR bars!,"I recently bought a bag of california natural healthbars lamb and rice for my dog and was DISCUSTED when I snapped one in half and found it was FULL of hair. I kept taking more and more out of the bag and snapping them in half and they were all full if hair. Thick black whisker like hair, thin white hair, even orange hair (I've certainly never seen an orange lamb). I called my local pet store about the discusting product, they were nice enough to refund me my $12.00 for the hairy cookies and pulled all the products from their shelf. I emailed a complaint letter to the company and as well placed a phone call. I never heard back from my email and the lady I spoke with on the phone basically told me it was ok that the cookies were full of hair. I will never buy any of their products ever again."
4,Great Scale. Great Price.,"Again, despite what the first reviewer states this scales DOES display weight in tenths of an ounce. (Perhaps he/she had it set for weighing in grams?) I bought this as a postal scale for mailing letters and packages from my home and not for weighing food. A 10 lb scale of lesser quality for postal purposes sells for $70 at Office Depot. The only thing that would be nice is a ""hold"" function commonly found on a postal scale, but for the price and Swiss quality I can live without it."
4,Mechanically weird,"The on/off/tare switch on this scale is actuated by pressing down the front left corner of the cover. In time, this cover can come loose from the base and interfere with the weighing platform. It is easily fixed by pressing down firmly on both sides of the panel next to the platform. Symptoms of this problem include inconsistent weights for the same item, and different weights for the same item placed on different areas of the platform. The front plate is designed to bend when actuating the on/off switch. The back of the plate next to the platform should not move. See also [...]."
2,No...no...no...,"Read consumer feedback FIRST! The ring looks better online than it does in reality. Apparently this jewelry is supposed to be ""Tiffany inspired""? But for this particular item, more like Tiffany's sister.....I kept the ring though because I needed a blue-stoned pinky ring. It fulfills its purpose....for now....In general, I find that the Eve's Addiction simulated stone rings are overpriced for the cheap-looking creations you end up getting. Their stainless steel line is great though, that's your better bet."
3,-1 on each cable,"After purchase it sat around changing for awhile. Then with the first decent snow of the year I went to plow with the ATV, but the ATV battery was dead. Hooked it up to the Booster Pac and the machine sprung to life on the first try. However hooking it up was the problem. The pack is good. The clips are excellent quality. But the cable is lucky if it is two foot long. That might work if I had a helper devoted to just holding the Pac, but it is unwieldy trying to find a spot to rest it that is close enough for the cable to reach. If they gave another foot it would be more than acceptable."
2,Cord,Charging cord gives up on charging. I had to order two of them so far. I got discouraged and bought a $200 one that has its own 110 cord to plug into wall outlet.
5,Booster PAC ES2500,"This is the Very Best Jump Starter made in my opinion. I have helped many peiople get going again, and just the turn of the key and it fires the engine up everytime. Would not be without it EVER!"
5,A time saver,"I have a sports car which I don't drive too often. Living in a hot desert area, batteries tend to have a short life. I've been caught with a bad or dead battery several times. This battery booster saves me a lot of time to get my car started."
4,Booster PAC ES2500,This device has work marvelously. I like automatic recharge feature after jumping car. You can also press a button to verify booster is fully charged. I have at times forgot to recharge Booter Pac ES2500 at home for a couple of weeks and battery has remained fully charged.The reason I gave four stars is short positive and negative cables.I do recommend purchasing device.
3,Business user,The contecting arms do not store easily into the holders on each side. Otherwise it is great.
5,The way to go!,"Instead of paying the dealer $50.00 to replace this on my Chrysler 300, I did it myself for less than $12.00 and 3 minutes time!"
5,exceptional cd! will breath new life into club scene,"This cd is not perfect and i regret saying that it is the actual 80's songs that drag this compilation down a level, but much of this album is new and emulates the 80's sound with deep dancable bass that seems to be the next step in club music evolution. Most of these songs were recorded in 2002, which gives us refreshing hope that electronic music has broken out of it's five year funk of redundancy, and now there is a clever sound, although borrowed in parts from the 80's, that can spearhead a new club scene. 16 of the 24 songs are thrilling and tickle your taste for more more more. the rest are flashbacks to the respectable 80's but stick out like sore thumbs and slow down the excitemant. do what you have to do to get this cd.....don't miss out on the future through the past."
2,Nice Try,"Good premise; snake oil salesmen are fun. But writing shows inexperience, and asides from author to reader are gauche and jejune. Ending seems unmotivated: why return to a radio station in flames? Fictionalizing of historical fact is well done, but invention would have been better. Female lead character is precious. Oddly, characters are most believable when bizarre, as if author finds it difficult to deal with what's normal. Worth reading author's next novel; this one a transition piece, because labored and flawed."
4,An unorthodox perspective that creates new insights.,"Ivan was a friend of mine at the time he wrote this book. It was a radical change from the natural history books he had written in the 30's and 40's. He was an extraordinary individual who chose to see beyond the commonplace. I think one needs to read this book in the context of his earlier writings.The chapter on the Atlantic Cedar forest stems from information my wife JoAnn and I brought to him. His interpretation far exceeded what I saw, yet I cannot honestly say it was in any way false or manipulated. I enjoyed the book almost as much as I enjoyed the man. Gerard Bentryn"
5,The truth is out there,"I am a pranormal investigator out of South Florida, and recently I was at a highschool durring an investigation. There was supposedly a ghost in the main library of the school. While running my emf meter near the book shelves, I found Ivan's book...interested I asked the librarian if I could take the book to read, and she said to me that I could have the book...after nothing turned up in the library I took the book home and read it...it's the best book I've read on the subject..I'd like to commend Ivan on the great writting."
4,Good Book Club Book,"We used this book to begin our Women's Book Club at our church. It was an excellent book to start with as it was not only funny, but also thought provoking. All of our ladies felt open to share to the questions after each chapter. It was a great way for us to get to know on another."
3,Good for the price,"These are not the best of euro horror, but are definitely worth a look. The first is The Red Headed Corpse a ghost story that does take to long to get to it's point but it is not with out some interesting moments.The next is Faceless Monster a well known and delightful horror movie with Barbara Steele, what more need be said.The last movie is Satanik a combination of horror and comic book and probably the weakest of the entries. But all in all an evening or rainy day worth of entertainment if you enjoy eurohorror and are not too discriminating."
2,very litle on indians,"The book belonged to a library.The text is an essay on the french and indian war, intersting but with one major defect, indian are treated only marginally."
5,I've bought 5 copies,I keep buying this book and giving them to our friends and family from Michigan and across the country. We don't go anywhere without our Hunt's. The descriptions are honest and comprehensive and we've never been disappointed. This is a must buy for anyone who visits or lives in Michigan.
1,Horrible!,"Under minimal scrutiny at the bookstore, this appeared to be an illustrated dictionary of household items, which seemed useful. However, after closer inspection at home, this book is utterly horrible. The concept, it appears, is to have phrases to say to your Polish house-servant. If that isn't bad enough, it is so full of errors I couldn't even begin to enumerate them here. It is a complete insult to the Polish language. The publisher it seems couldn't even be bothered to find someone who is barely literate in Polish or to maybe even open a dictionary to check it."
2,Disappointed,"From the reviews, you would think you are getting a crisp ""how to"" book on successfully implementing BPM. If may be in the pages, but the verbage and numerous peripheral topics detract from a pick-up and use that I was expecting. This book could be distilled to half the pages but the authors do not know how to get to the bottomline. For these reasons, I was disappointed."
5,Depth of Knowledge from Experience,"First BPM book that provides this level of depth. The framework described should be closely looked at by mid and large companies bringing BPM. I believe it's most beneficial to center of excellence participants, BPM project managers and executve sponsors. The maturity model described on page 300 is outstanding."
4,Martín Roberts,"I think this book offers an interesting set of tools to be used in a BPM implementation, but the approach is too ""soft"", it lacks of deeper treatment of topics. The transition of a company from ""function centric"" to ""process centric"" is crucial in this kind of projects, and I think this subject is not developed in the right way."
4,Eminently practical,We love this book and have purchased a copy of it for everyone on our team. Great handbook for running a BPM project except for when it comes to details on how to execute process solutions in a BPMS.
2,Probably a better book for large scale implementations,I didn't feel like this book was very helpful for me looking forward to planning a small-scale BPM implementation.I think it tended to describe best practices for a large scale implementation.From that perspective I feel I didn't get much from the book.
2,Not practical,"I hate to be the odd-one out, but I did not find this book helpful. I am new to BPM and wanted an organized and tactical guide. This is not that. This book has a lot of fluff and jargon and provides little direction. I would not recommend this book to others."
4,Good short read,"This is a good read. It is comprehensive, and short. Knowing the context of this would make it a lot more relevant I think. It was difficult for me to ascertain the purpose Lenin had in writing this. He brags a lot about Russian socialism and throws a few shout outs to America's proletariat while he is at it. Regardless, people interested in Marxism should read this."
3,Zane! Don't Slip! This was Blah!,"This is my first Zane novel that I didn't love!!! No, Heatseekers wasn't all of that either. But this was a disappointment.I did like the return of Dr. Marcella Spencer from my all-time favorite Addicted, but this book was missing something. Maybe it was the suspense, mystery, fun, I don't know. Let me see...Okay, I can come up with one thing about the book that was the BOMB! The bathroom scene and the results after that Jonquinette had as a child. That was the best part of the book. Oh yeah -- I did love the mother daughter scene in the restaurant!! Funny!!The rest was kind of boring and a little predictable. But Zane is still the girl!!! I hope she returns to something like Addicted."
4,"Um, I guess it was okay...","All my friends were talking about Zane, so I tried to give Nervous a chance. I'm glad cause it was a good book, but that was about it. Maybe it was cause I was expecting better, but what I recived wasn't all that. Zane had a unique way of telling the story,and for the most part there was never a dull moment. But at times the plot it self became boring. The ending was predictable, but like I said before all in all it was a good book,filled with some suspence."
5,A Must Read!,"I just started back reading and let me tell you this, I after reading Nervous, I went out and purchased ALL of Zane's book."
5,STOP RIGHT NOW !!!!!!!!!!! READ THIS!!!!!!!!,I haven't even finished this book yet I am currently on page 55. WOW my girl ZANE has done it again. ZANE is a master storyteller. She grabs your attention from the first page and keeps you all the way to the last page. This book is better than addicted. My fellow avid readers who some of you have been hating on ZANE. You better get on the team because ZANE is no joke. You will always be my favorite author Keep these books rolling.
4,"The Three J's- Jonquinette, Jude and Jetta","Wow, Zane really did her thing with this story line. I've had this book since 2007 and just finished reading it due to the fact of reading other stories that I found to be four or five stars. I thought that there wasn't going to be sex involved because of the mental disorder that Jonquinette had but boy was I wrong. She had two other personalities, Jude, which was the freakalic and Jetta showed up at the end of the story to give the reasons why she appeared. I found the book to be a page turner."
2,Unrealistic,The Story was a lil Unrealistic it was not a horrible book but the ending does not seem realistic.
5,Who said people don't have multiple personalities?,"Nervous, was making me nervous through out the whole book. At one moment sista was cool, calm and collective and at the next she was totally different, doing things that one could never expect. They always said that the quiet ones are always the true freaks."
1,It Makes Me NERVOUS . . .,". . . to know that our young black girls and women are reading her books and then finding themselves up the creek without a paddle. Like for instance, getting pregnant and not knowing who the daddy is; catching an STD or contracting HIV/AIDS. Young women, WAKE UP and read something that's going to stir your intellect, not your loins!"
3,Kinda mediocre,I just thought that some of the storytelling didn't make sense at times. The sex scenes were the only interesting aspects of the novel. Mediocrity at it's best.
4,Zane's Nervous,this was a birthday gift for my daughter. i know she will enjoy it she loves Zanes writing. i will order again from you all the book was in excellent condition
3,Wanted more but not that bad,This book was o.k. not bad and not greatThe book is like addicted with a twist.The only difference is the lady in thisbook has M.P.D. The start of the book wasnot good at all but the last 100 pages waspretty good. If you like addicted then youwill like this book.
5,"A MUST READ!!!! If they had 10 stars, that's what its worth","This book was sooo good that I gave it around of applause when I read the last sentence. In order to understand the story, first read the short story in Sex Chronicles, then RUN and get the book. This story has some serious many plot changes, that'll have you not wanting to put it down. I read it in 2 days!!! Zane's writing captures the reader and brings it to you, FULL FORCE.The final 2 chapters in the book will have you like WHOA!!!! I'm still trippin, LOL. Like I said RUN DONT WALK and purchase this book. It is well worth the money. OOOO for you Addicted lovin folks, Zoe make an appearance in Nervous."
4,Very Interesting,The book was very interesting. I thought Jude was of the hook and Mason is the man I have been looking for. My only problem with the book is it seemed that towards the end it seemed like Zane rushed the ending.PSSST!! Book Club Memberwww.pssst.1colony.com
5,"You are making me ""Nervous""",To have multi-personalities and not know is very perplexed to me...but to have one sleeping with everything and not know and to have one so innocence is a page turner in itself...Ms. Zane has done it again
1,Are you forn real!,I gave this book 1 star because it was totaly unbelievable. It was crass and poorly written. Please don't waist your money on this book.
3,3.5 stars,"Not one of her best, but still a good read. I love Zane when she's funny and erotic. Her more ""serious"" books are good but don't have that ""Zane Zing"" that I love."
5,Nervous,I loved this book. It was a trip at the end. I would recommend this book for everyone to read. Great Job Zane!!yalonda878
5,"Something about ""Nervous""",This book was awesome. I did not want to put it down. I love all of Zane's books and have recommended them to several different people. Zane is a fantastic author!!!!!
4,Keeps you wanting to read more and more...,"Nervous is a book that keeps you reading. Once you try to stop, you can't because you hit another good part. I really liked this book and highly recommend it."
5,A Great Read!!!,This was a great book! I couldn`t put it down. I read it in 1sitting. This was the first book that I`ve read by Zane and it won`t be the last!
3,THE KING OF EROTICA IS BETTER,"I give Zane her props for delivering another so-called good book, but there is a new dude on the scene giving her a run for her money. And his books are called The King of EroticaThe KING of Erotica 1: The Throne's Special Edition"
2,Not Impressed!,"I must say that I really did not get what I expected from this book. It was so predictable in one sense, but unrealistic as well. We will be discussing this book in a book club meeting soon, so I'm anxious to see what the other members thought. As for me, I could have done without it and I was NOT IMPRESSED!"
4,Good to the last page,This book was a fast and excellent read. Zane took the writing back to the original form of Addicted. I felt for Jonquinette and kept reading to find out what lied in this character. The story was great and kept me thoroughly entertained. I can't wait to read the next in the serious. Zane keeping writing and I will keep reading.
2,And I was being nice,"This was the first Zane novel I read and ""disappointed"" is not a strong enough word for what I felt when I finally closed it. I read the whole thing in one sitting because I was getting my hair braided at the time, otherwise the book would have gone flying out of a window somewhere. It had no point...at all. Everything was so far-fetched. But, all that aside- why is she so vulgar? Sex can be described as something fiercely enjoyable without being so crass. I found the story to be utterly tasteless and poorly written. I tried to give her a chance because of all the rants and raves about her but I think I have had enough already."
5,Off The Chain!,"Zane outdid herself this time. ""Nervous was so good!"" I could not put it down. I loved how she connected the characters from ""Addicted"" into this book. I can't wait for the other 3 books she says will follow this one."
3,Nervous,"It's sad to say that I believe that Zane has lost her touch. Well, she has for me anyway. I WAS a dedicated Zane fan until now, and I too like most ran out and bought Nervous, I should have waited for it to come out in paperback or at the least wait until my friend read it and saved a whole lot of money. The character (as usual) is fighting with some kinda sexual issue, blah, blah, blah. I know, I know, thats why we read Zane, for the sex, however, it is getting kinda old. Now I'm not saying that Nervous is a horrible book, but it could have been a lot better, especially after reading Addicted, Shame on it All, and Shattering the Myth. My advise dont expect the same from this book as the others and you wouldn't be disappointed."
4,IT WAS GOOD!!,"I really liked this book. It's different because it takes a step away from what we usually read. I like the multiple personality thing, it was different. I like Zane's writing because she keeps me interested. This is a must-read."
4,nervous,I just loved the book. I like how the story deal with real things that has happen to some one some where and just bring it to life. Go Zane! I look fordward to reading more of her books.
4,so......so.......!!!!!,"This book was OK...I haven't read many Zane books but out of the ones i read this was at the end of the list, only because you know whats going to happen next. I would recommend this book to read but DEFINATELY not a first ZANE read."
5,Can't put it down!,"First of all, if you wrote a bad review for this book because its too ""raunchy"", you're FIRED!!! Its called erotica. Zane, keep doing the damn thang girlfriend. This book was really good. And there's a suprise at the end of the book that I would have never guessed. I recommend to anyone who likes erotic to read all of Zane's books."
3,"Zane is making ME ""Nervous""!!!!!","Being a Zane fan I naturally bought this book. But I guess my expectations were too high!! Although I enjoyed reading the book, in my opinion it was predictable. After reading Addicted I am suprised the story went in the direction it did. Nevertheless, I am still a fan of Zane and look forward to something ""different"" in her future works."
5,"Wow, what a ride!","Interesting, thrilling, unusual, and sexy. Overall, page for page, one of her best books by far. If you liked Addicted, you will love Nervous! Zane gets better and better with each book she writes!"
5,Off The Hook!!!!!!,"Zane has done it again, she is the best author!!!!! I have all of her books, and cannot wait for the next!!!!"
4,EXCELLENT!,"Zane did it again.....It was definitely a page turner. I bought the book on Thursday and was finished by Sunday. I didn't have much time to read it but I MADE time to read. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is because at one point it was a bit unbelievable but overall, the book was GOOD!"
3,Holley Truck Avenger,"Do not expect to the Holley Truck Avenger to be a ""bolt on and go"" carb. It has a serious flat spot just off of idle. Seems to be a very common problem with this carb, especially on vehicles with a cam or engine that is not stock. However, If you are able to ""tune"" the carb so that the off idle flat spot goes away it will be the greatest off road carb you could ever find."
4,Motivating and Exciting,There's nothing more motivating then to be given workout and fitness tips from a master. I really got my money's worth from the tips straight from the trainer himself as well as see the miraculous results in his own body. I definitely recommend.
1,Big Disappointment,"This DVD mostly body building pose, no chest exercise, only some arms exercises and some poor general legs working.ICON Men, I'm sorry but I'm going to think twice before buying again one of your products,"
3,Not perfect,"I bought mine quite more than 3 yrs ago at a much lower price from Amazon. It boils a full pot pretty fast and the quality is good. However, it seems to not create enough pressure to force a good amount of the water out when you press the pump; you sort of have to quickly pump a few times to build up the pressure. This could be related to the fact the lid isn't perfectly tight, so some of the pressure may just escape when you press the pump. I'm not sure if it's just a design flaw or quality control issue."
3,I have owned two,"I have owned 2 of these.The 1st bought in about 2002 lasted until 2011, when the cover gasket broke and rendered the unit no longer able to pump. Roughly 9 years use -- pretty good - five stars.The 2nd bought 2011 died in 6 months - electrical fail. Onboard computer likely culprit. 1st warning sign was it was always boiling -- several times a day. Then... in a few days...dead -- 1 star.So, that's how I landed on a 3 star rating.I still like the unit, but this model seems ""iffy"". I might buy another of the same brand (Zojirushi), but the 3 Liter unit instead of this 2.2 liter unit -- unless I can find another brand that has better reviews."
4,........Too Short..........Interesting...........,This Yu Yu Hakusho movie was pretty good. They could of made it better though. 1. it was too short. Its only 30 mintues. 2. it was too jumpy. 3. too much kuwabara and yusuke. There were only about 3 places Hiei and Karama appeared! 4. kinda kidish
5,Fantastic!!!,It's really a great movie!!! And Eugene is really very clever in finding out ways to defeat his enemy!!!And Dennis and Vincente there is so handsome!!!=)
1,not what i expected at all,they're not really flashcards but rather questions on cards with answers. It looks like the cut a bunch of tests and put them on a card.
4,Zojirushi Kettle,I purchased some of my beautiful herbal medicinal teas from my favorite herbal remedy shop [...]( be SURE to get their Skinny Mini tea-I lost 18 pounds and now have ZERO cellulite! ) and they recommended this product-it works great although the boil time is a bit slow. It also looks great on my counter and I love that the water is ready for me all day..highly recommend this product!
4,great pot,"great pot. I'm annoyed at having to press the ""unlock"" button everytime, the one that prevents accidental spills. the automated dispensing is too slow for my tastes, I'm used to an earlier version that you have to press down from the top. in hindsight I should have bought an earlier version to avoid the differencesI'm also really annoyed at the shipping, bought through amazon, it was shipped in the box that the manufacturer put it in, which wasn't up for the rigors of shipping. but honestly I can't tell if the gaping crowbar-looking inflicted holes were caused by the shipping or not"
1,Won't work over 5000 feet elevation per Zojirushi service reps.,I bought this item based on the outstanding reviews I found on this site. Only to receive the item and read the owners manual to discover it does NOT work at high altitudes (over 5000 feet). I called customer service to have this fact confirmed twice. So if you live above 5000' don't bother to buy it. It will NOT shut off and WILL start fires. I got to pay shipping both directions. What a waste!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Zojirushi review,"This is a great product. The water comes out smoothly and is very hot.The reason I give it 4 starts instead of 5 is that unfortunately, the cord is attached by a magnet to the electric pot itself and very easily becomes accidently unattached if the pot has been moved slightly or something has been put down near the cord. We've had the experience several times of finding that this has happened and thus the water is no longer hot. Although the magnet makes it easy to join the cord to the pot, it should really be redesigned so that it can't come out so easily."
4,Hot water dispenser,"I just love this water dispenser! It would be perfect if the water came to a boil a little faster, but other than that I highly recommend it. It makes serving afternoon tea so much easier, having 4 liters of water at the ready."
3,"Overall is good, but....",I know there is a lot of good reviews on this model. But there are several things i don't like:1) No backlight in the water level gauge. so it's hard to see how much water left in the night;2) Water pump sounds much louder than my previous one (Ikeda);3) No alert sound if water temperature reaches the target;Note: i didn't set anything and just use the default setting after opened the box. Hopefully i didn't miss anything from the manual.
2,Full of holes?,"The only good thing about this is that it fit perfectly (a bit small than the tent footprint-I have the Eureka Apex 2XT).After one night of being set up on grass--just grass--I took my tent down and found the floor saver full of tiny holes and dents all over. It did ""save"" my floor I suppose but not my much.I think I will just use a tarp next time."
4,Works like it's supposed to.,"It's a fairly thick tarp that works like it's supposed to. I would reccommend it, so the bottom of your tent is saved. Very light too."
2,Poor Quality,"First, I was disappointed that the Eureka footprints didn't actually attach to the tent. Other brands hook into the pools which hold the footprint in place.Second, the quality of the footprint is poor. Rocks and other objects on the ground leave marks in it.It's essentially a low quality tarp."
1,Why are there no dimensions listed?,Who would buy this if there are no dimensions listed? I plan to go backpacking and size and weight are key. Why would I want to buy something that may be too big or heavy and infringe on my packing room and carry-on-weight factor?
3,"""To know the will of God, and to do it.""","The title ""Loving Monday"" is the main reason why I purchased this book and began reading it before any of the other dozen selections from a Christian business book list I received from church this past Sunday. I listened to it on CD. As a regular audio book listener, I found the content to be good but the delivery just OK.With regard to the content I would have to say that Mr Beckett is filling a real need for books on this topic -I was just disappointed that there weren't more examples given to support the key concepts.Ultimately, whether or not I love Monday's -""To know the will of God, and to do it."" is the key concept from Mr Beckett's book for me personally."
2,What a disappointment!,"I paid what I consider quite a bit of money just for a toaster, but I thought Cuisinart would make it worth my money. I was lulled into a false sense of security for the first two weeks, as that produced pretty decent toast. But after 2 weeks, it started to barely toast the middle of the bread, and to burn the crusts. I tried multiple settings but nothing helped. The instructions said that users might have to change the settings with each piece of bread because of variations in moisture and such. Good heavens, who can make such an assessment at 7 AM? The feature I really liked was the long horizontal slot that could hold a slice of bread machine bread. They don't fit in most toasters, so that was what convinced me to return this model for an identical one. But alas, the same thing happened, and now I will be returning the second one as well. Now if you love burnt crusts, this the machine for you!"
2,"Nice exterior, bad innards!","I stupidly ignored a friends advice who owned one, and purchased because of the design. It rarely toasted evenly (bread/waffles) nor did it handle bagels well. Now after 3 years, it is dead.So for 80 bucks you get poor performance, good looks, and a warranty which expires before it does. Nice job Cuisinart! You won't fool me with ANY of your other products."
5,Great graphic novel,"Fantasy and comic book illustrator Charles Vess (see his work on the early Sandman comic books) provides thirteen illustrative stories written by eleven different highly regarded authors that are based on famous ballads. The tales are cleverly conceived as Mr. Vess and a renowned fantasist take a well known verse and turns it into a delightful illustrated story. The original ballad follows the animated tale for those who seek the complete package. The pictures are in black and white, but that brings a historical feel to the retelling of the ballads; thus this enhances the conversion as color would make it prettier, but subtract from the wonderful total affect. A rather different type of anthology, fans of graphic tales will appreciate this marvelous unique collection that contains wonderful interpretations of famous ballads like the Black Fox and Thomas the Rhymer by a who's who of fantasy.Harriet Klausner"
5,Love this sandalwood scent,"I've bought several different brands of incense labeled as being Sandalwood, but as you may know, there's a huge variation in how they smell. To me, some brands smell terrible. This one is my favorite by far. A very soothing sandalwood scent that I love."
4,far superior to other types of everyday sandalwood incense,"I know that this stuff is cheap, but compared to several other brands in the price range (eg. Nag Champa, Morning Star), Viva smells the most like real sandalwood. Again, this is simple, everyday incense, but it is excellent for that purpose."
5,"Fantastic video, top talent","This is the best music video I have ever seen and heard, Cliff is a great talent. The video is a highlight of the music that was performed at the Event in 1989, the Event was many hours long and they did not show every performance on this video it is only two hours. I wish they had not left out the Hank Marvin performances. If you buy this video you will not be disappointed unless you do not like music, there is old time 60s Rock and Roll and all kinds of different types of music on this video, some of Cliff's greatest hits through the years. If you have not heard Cliff Richard then you have missed a lot of good music, he has sold over 260 million records in his career, stared in movies, hosted a TV show in the 1970s and is one of the best Rock and Roll singers of all time on par with Elvis and the Beetles. I would rate this video as a 10+."
4,Feraud,"It was a blind buy. A friend suggest me this perfume, I couldn't find it in any stores so I decide to get it on Amazon. What can I say.....I like the perfume, it is nice light spring-summer scent, good for every day use. What I didn't like that the box with perfume was opened by someone before they send it to me. Also box was damaged inside. I am glad it wasn't a gift. So I keep the perfume because I like it and price was good but I will not buy again from LeBec63 for sure."
5,perfect!,"We discovered this olive oil after having it on some grilled bread at our favorite restaurant. We had to ask the chef what kind it was, since we had tried to re-create this grilled bread at home, with no success. The taste far surpasses any I have tasted, and has turned my husband and me into 'olive oil snobs'! It is a staple in our house, for dressings, vegetables, sauteing, whatever. Highly recommended!!"
5,Excellent!,I've tried many different kinds of high-end olive oil and have been disappointed many times by the stale flavor. A friend bought me a bottle of this after she discovered it and now it's the only olive oil I use. Divina's taste is ALWAYS fresh and mild but flavorful - perfect for green salads or tomato salads or bread. Well worth the cost. You can easily spend a fortune on brands you think might be good - or you can buy Divina and know it's good. I choose the latter ...
5,The Best olive oil,"Whether for just dipping fresh bread in or adding delicious buttery flavor to a sauce, this olive oil is the most flavorful of any that I have ever tried. I would reccommend it to anyone."
1,Not real Olive Oil,"Just (probably) corn oil flavored like it.I opened a *new* bottle and it was rancid, Olive Oil does not go rancid (full of anti-oxidants) unless it's older than Greece."
1,NOT the traditional quality of Oneida Community stainless!,"Made in China, these 18/10 Oneida Rondel place spoons are NOT the traditional heft or quality of Oneida. They feature a large bowl thats more like a tablespoon than a place spoon and have a lightweight unbalanced feel to them. If you' re trying to replace an item, don't think these will match your existing flatware. Not recommended."
5,just the best,had to replace the old fluke Probes and these fit just like the original from 10 years ago. Great product.
1,Wrong Item Pictured,The only items included are the two Black and Red Probes in the lower right of the picture
5,Excellent quality probes...expect nothing less from Fluke,"This is a highly recommended product...and a great improvement from my old test probes mind you. Just to clear up any confusion as posted by other reviews, you will receive: One pair (red, black) of Industrial test probes (12 mm stainless steel tips) that are CAT III (1,000V) & CAT IV (600V) rated.Again, this is just for the probes ONLY.You will need to combine these probes with, depending on your requirements, either the TL222 or the TL224 test leads (the leads connect the probes to your meter).Anyway, awesome product and the ""SureGrip"" texture is very nice compared to Fluke's ""old"" style of insulation/grip."
4,My favorite tips,"I love the flat spots on the TP220s. They feel just right in you hands. I also like the silicon shields at the front end. They also have a flat spot, so you can hook them into the outer rubber case on your DMM.My one gripe is that so much of the tip is exposed. Why? This is my third set because I keep shorting them out in tight spaces. I thought about maybe painting some of that rubber tool handle stuff on there. I might just try it and test."
4,Pricey but work good...,"Pricey but work good...I got the TP220 with TL224 (straight one end and 90 the other)...I got these because thy feel better in-hand, are high quality, and have a very sharp tips, that I need, working on electronics (SMT and TH).I haves these leads/ probes, already with my home Fluke 88V-5, and I just got a 87V-5 used from ebay, for work use. It came with some older Fluke lower cost leads. I like the 220/224, set so I got a new set. Also, these work fine with the Standard alligator clips...However, I found that the combination of the two connections and wire, that I had 0.2-OHMs more than a lower cost Fluke leads, that only had 0.1-OHMs. Using the REL function, I can subtract the hole 0.2-OHMs. Probably not a problem anyway...Bottom line: Happy but more poor (expensive)..."
4,Good information - and pictures too,"Wherever you are in the City it's hard not to be aware of the many types of birds to be seen in your back yard or from your balcony. This book is perfect for all budding ornithologists, as it contains clear non-jargon descriptions of our local birds, well-coloured pictures, and good background information. Take care - birding is addictive! You start with a lazy look out the window at a strange bird. Then you go buy your first book, like this one, to put a few names to a few beaks. Next you find yourself buying birdfood and putting up nesting ledges and houses to attract more birds. It's the slippery slope to birdmania, and many enjoyable hours of bird watching. Enjoy!"
3,Delivery Estimates,"I cannot really write a review on this product yet,as i havenot had this item yet.Although i suppose when i receive it,i hope it will be on time and i look forward to it being the typeof book i want.I hope that there will not be lots of delays onthis book for me,it looks a nice book and i hope to have hoursof enjoyment from it."
5,Never left my side,"This book reveals many answers to the questions even I asked when I started my career in cartooning. The interviews and thoughts, efforts put in to this book is one reason why even after 16 years as a cartoonist I still enjoy being able to read through this book and get something out of it every time. This isn't just for those starting out, it's also a reminder for those in the industry."
1,This is not danish band called Bliss,"I'm was dissapointed to when I got this cd, this don't even get close to the danish band called Bliss - would love to get my money back.""Danish"" Bliss supporter"
4,BRING IT BACK!,"I read this book for the first time years ago, And read it and read it and read it! It finally fell apart. How can we convince the publishers to re-release this? I like it a lot but not enough to pay $68 for a used paperback. Anyone know who to contact to get out of print books re-published? This is a fun read, not deep, just a romance. But I would love to read it again."
5,I love this book,"This is definitely a book I would like to see made available for Kindle. I read it several times as a young adult, and went through two copies of it. The characters are well-developed, especially Claire. The interweaving of the sisters' stories is well done. The clues to the mysteries are there to be seen from the beginning, but so cleverly hidden that it is easy to find yourself missing most of them. If you get the chance, read this book, especially if you enjoy alternate reality fantasies full of romance and even murder."
3,"Bear with me, this is my first review....","I kept telling my daughter, ""I don't think I can read this,"" but it really hooked me after ""Brenda Kay"" was born. Although many readers may not like the fact that Jewel devoted her life to Brenda Kay much to the exclusion of her other children, it touched my maternal heart to know that Jewel would not just whisk her off to an institution. Also, if you have any feminist leanings you probably wouldn't care for Jewel's husband, Lester who never helped her at all or gave her any support. But, Jewel's triumphs with her daughter were heartening."
4,Mother's Strength,"As a mother of three healthy children, I found this story to be incredibly powerful and touching. Jewel's love for Brenda Kay and her siblings is undying and true. I was amazed at how well Bret Lott captured the voice of a mother and the complicated emotions attached to that role. It is a beautifully written book."
4,Jewel is a Gem,"As the daugher of a teacher who has spent over 20 years working with children and adults with both mild to severe mental disabilies, Bret Lott's Jewel is a fair representation of the stories and experience's she has shared with me over the years. I enjoyed this book and will recommend it to friends."
3,Better than Oprah's last pick.,"After ""Pilot's Wife"" I was ready to boycott Oprah's future picks. I rather liked the story; the southern speaking and writing style didn't bother me. I can see why some people (New Yorkers for example) would not care for it. However, what really got on my absolute last nerve were the whiners about the use of the word ""nigger."" Get a grip folks. That's the way people thought and spoke in the 40's and 50's. Fortunately, we've come a long way since then, but give me a break, you can't change history. You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. I shudder to think how future generations will look upon the way we spoke in the 90's, i.e., a CNN news anchor using the ""f"" word live on the air! Relax and enjoy a reasonably good read about an interesting subject. Look at the forest, not the trees."
2,slow moving--nothing that keeps you in suspense,I liked the way he linked present occurence with past events...however he could have written the story in less pages. I found myself skimming many a paragraph or page to get to the point.
1,The book was so poorly written that it could not enjoy it.,"I had high expectations of this book, because it came so highly recommended by Oprah Winfrey. I mostly trust her judgement. However, the book was so poorly written that it distracted me from potentially enjoying it. I do not appreciate Mr. Lott's writing style. I felt as if I was slogging through a swamp most of the time, occasionally being allowed to walk through unimpeded. Reading it was a trial. I have not read any of his other books, but may not due to my disappointment over reading ""Jewel"". The content of the book could have had some merit had he expanded on the joys that could be derived from having a handicapped child, rather than the downside. Better luck to him on his next endeavor!"
5,A wonderful book,"Brett Lott has produced a richly written story about the complexity and intensity of a mother's love and the imperfect human condition despite our best efforts toward perfection. This is a thought-provoking, real life, wonderful book. I'm looking forward to reading The Hunt Club."
4,Insightful. A MAN wrote this?,"Although I have bought most of the books on Oprah's list, I have rarely been able to get into or care at all for what she chooses. I only bought this one because Bret Lott is a professor to a friend's child in college, and they highly recommended it.But I did like the book. It was boring at times, certainly, but the issues were right on and I was surprised by the author's ability and insightfulness into Jewel's feelings. After all, how can a man truly understand a woman's feelings? Perhaps Mr. Lott had a little help from his wife here.All in all, I'd recommend it to my college kids and JEWEL will have a solid place in my home library."
1,Oh Please!,"I read this book when I was in seventh grade and desperately trying to find more substantive reading material. It was difficult to get through--not due to a poor reading proficiency on my part, but due to the fact that it is a jumble of melodramatic efforts intended to pull at your heartstrings and do nothing more than that. Even then I found Lott's novel to be tired, unoriginal, and formulaic. It's current resurgence, I am sure, is more reflective of the Oprah's Book Club sticker on the cover than of any literary merit the book supposedly harbors. I know I didn't find any at 13 and I don't expect to now."
5,It's hard to believe the author is not a woman!,"As with Wally Lamb's book She's Come Undone, it is hard to believe this book was written by a man. The thoughts and feelings of this woman are so true to life. This book is a wonderful read."
3,Story realizes the unending trial of Downs syndrome. Loong.,"Jewel was an admirable character who learned to cope with Downs and with a world that fails to appreciate their needs. But, she was over-dedicated, neglected the other children and husband, and was never able to be objective about this. I see this happen at times in working with special needs families (not just the kids themselves.) A good book for someone just starting out in the field, although times have really changed. Not a book for someone who is looking for action, but it is introspective."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"It took me six months to read this very boring book(I usually read 1-2 books per week). Please, please do not waste your time and money, you will be disappointed. Oprah what were you thinking?"
2,Hmmm....,"I realy don't know whether this book was realy great and I didn't have the patience to read it thoroughly, or it was just boring. I did read the whole book, but as other people have stated, I just couldn't relate to the characters. It was as though they didn't have any personality! And then there was the constant babbling..on and on...about nothing...so I would have to skip it."
2,Grueling towards the latter half,"It was a good beginning in that it sets the stage telling about the life of a woman from Mississippi who grows up, marries has five children, a little about her husband and the individual children,then they have this mentally retarded (6th child) daughter. The rest of the book is dedicated to mom and daughter's life, which seems to blow the rest of the family to the wind as the two were inseperable. Towards the 3/4 pt of the book, it just got grueling and repetitious. I could not wait to finish the book. It had a blah ending."
3,Reviewer: sb,"I agree with some of the prior reviews that this book moves a little slow; however, the main plot kept me interested enough in the story to complete this novel. I strongly agree with reviewer eb, from FL, that the use of the ""N"" word was used too frequently and too freely by the author. The author seemed to have enjoyed using this word, I found this quite disturbing. What color ""N"" was the author talking about? The definition of this word has nothing to do with the race of a person, maybe the author should look this word up in a dictionary, FAST."
4,avid reader,"I enjoyed this story that takes you through a life with a disabled child. It realistically depicts the southern prejudices amongst races. This story covers compassion, forgiveness, disapppointment and acceptance. Jewel captures your heart."
3,Inconsistent read,"Jewel starts out very nicely and engages the reader. The style of writing in which the author moves back and forth between her own childhood and her adulthood is enjoyable. However, as the book progresses, the childhood moments are dropped and the new life in California takes center stage, and is far less enjoyable. The book begins to drag. It picks up a bit at the ending, though the impitus for moving from Mississippi a second time back to California due to a snake was not beleivable for a family who grew up in backwoods Mississippi. Had they never seen a snake before? Perhaps Lester could have just missed his other children, a more plausible reason.Overall, the book was not consistent, good moments and poor."
2,mediocre,"I bought this book at an airport newsstand. It gave me insight into what it must be like to raise a Downs syndrome child, but the characters were underdeveloped. Lott did an excellent job of representing a woman's viewpoint; however, at times I believed that he was trying to create another ""To Kill a Mockingbird""; obviously, ""Jewel"" falls far short of the above classic. And since when is someone in his/her forties or fifties considered ""old""?"
4,A leap of faith,"I gave this book 4 stars and I'm not sure why....you see, I'm not sure that I buy the premise...that an ole Mississippi child, born and raised down bayou way is capable of generating such profound and wordly psychobabble...tons of words which envelope and almost strangle any forward progression of time and events which occur in this book. You really get ""bogged"" down as poor ole Jewel brings waffling and wavering with respect to her feelings and actions to new heights and at times this book comes to a screetching halt....only to lurch forward again in time and space, much to my satisfaction. I almost buy this premise and therefore I think 4 stars is appropriate...if you don't think this lass has the neurons to generate such thoughts, believe me, you are going to hate this book."
1,Characters lack depth and are stereotypic,"What a compelling topic--and how disappointing to see how Lott presented it. Professionally and personally, I have known many individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. Neither Jewel nor Brenda Kay had any depth of character--in fact all the characters seemed like cardboard. Watch the documentary ""Best Boy"" for an indepth portrayal of the impact a person with a disability can have on all those around him/her--a good piece of literature would have left the same lasting impression that this film did. Lott missed the boat."
3,"A ""thick"" book","In more ways than one, this book is ""thick"". Plan to spend some time reading it. The author rehashes every tiny detail over and over again. Either the author thinks I'm ""thick"" and didn't get the first time, or I really am ""thick"" and didn't get the point of reliving the details.It took me 3 months to read this book. I could put it down and not come back to it for 2 weeks at a time. While I was interested in the story line, the book became a dark shadow over me. I had to finish it, and in the end, the book finished a little too quietly for me. It was also a slow read just mushing through the words that seemed to lumber across the page.The edition I read also had numerous errors that I found irritating and distracting(the word ""out"" would be printed instead of ""our""). Mr. Lott needs to get a new proof reader.I did find the story line good, but a bit heavy."
1,A Totally Depressing Story,"I found this book totally depressing from cover to cover. I have read that people who have children with Down's Syndrome receive joy from the loving nature of these children. It seemed to me Jewel did not find much joy or pleasure in anything, much less Brenda Kay. She took care of her as a duty and obligation, but I never got the feeling she had a lot of love for this child. When they went on the picnic, she was scheming the whole time to get Lester to California. She couldn't just enjoy a rare family outing. She liked the fact that Lester was a loser. It gave her power."
1,A Disgrace Toward Books,"I don't think that this book is even worth one star. Unfortunatly, I am not able to put less than one star on here, or it would deffinetly be less than that. I picked it up, thinking that I would enjoy it very much, but found that I could not get through half of it. Don't try and read this if you aren't patient. You won't finish it. And even if you are, its going to take you a while to get through it, and it won't be a favorite. I wouldn't recommend wasting your money on this."
3,Incorrect Terminology,"It is incorrect to refer to it as ""Down's syndrome"" or ""Downs syndrome."" It is, in fact, Down syndrome and it's disappointing that whomever wrote the product description didn't bother to check on the accurate terminology of this genetic condition. It is named after John Langdon Down and it is correctly called Down syndrome."
2,"Wonderfully written, Entirely too long, Where's the ending","I debated on purchasing this book because of the subject matter. I have a cousin who is a Down's Syndrome child. After toiling with the thought or reliving this past - I decided to read it from someone else's perspective. The information is true and very accurate; however, the book focuses too much on Jewel. It seems, at times, to go on page and page saying the same thing. The thing that really irritated me the most was the ending. I dont think Mr. Lott planned the ending very well. One assumes Brenda Kay's outcome, but we never find out. We only find out that Jewel lives to be a very old, regretful woman.Don't waste your time."
3,honest and gut wrenching,"I enjoyed the book because I was born and raised in the very part of Mississippi that Mr. Lott's JEWEL lives in. The characters were vivid and believable and reminded me of some of the very folks I've known in my life. The one thing that has bugged me from the minute I read it until now is Mr. Lott's inaccurate statement that Pearl River Junior College is in Picayune,MS. It is in Poplarville, MS. All in all I found JEWEL to be a most heartwarming read.Hattiesburg, Mississippi"
4,very realistic read!!!!!,"""Jewel"" was a finely told story of a woman and her six children. I especially loved the way Brett Lott used the accents. This book was really good. It took me a while to read it, but it was not boring in the least."
3,Not what I expected.,"I've read through the previous reviews--amazed that so many thought that the author captured the feelings of a mother. My biggest criticism of the book is that I didn't feel the depth and passion of love that I have for my daughter (who is healthy. I thought a lot of Jewels actions toward Brenda Kay were ritualistic and done out of a sense of responsibility and determination. In fact, all of the characters lacked a passion for each other as individuals or as a family. Jewel's relationship with her husband was not honest. I suppose a lot of their attitudes were a ""sign of the times"" but it disturbs me nonetheless, especially the characterization of southerners."
4,Great book,"This book was so much better than Mother of Pearl.Anyone who is a mother can relate to this book - I had to check several times to make sure it really was written by a man. The only disappointment was the way it ended. To me, it was much too abrubt."
2,"starts out very very good, then gets very very dull.","This book starts out wonderful. Jewels early life is entertaining, sad, and inspiring. But as the book goes on it gets rather boring. You really don't get close to any of the characters. But you're reading an account of someones life, and not a conversational story. I would recomment it if you want a mellow read."
2,"This book is boring, boring, boring!","If Jewel looked back at her life one more time and said how she had shortchanged her other children for Brenda Kay I would have screamed. The book didn't flow, it crawled. Very repetitive."
1,Yuck. Keep looking.,"I kept waiting for something to happen, and it never did. It was hard to get thru because it was a lot of bla bla bla."
3,THREE AND A HALF STARS,"As an avid reader I really enjoyed this book and was made aware of just how few books there are about the mentally and physically handicapped. Lott's story really opened my eyes and made me sympathetic to those who must deal with similar hardships.Lott's voice as a countrified woman is fabulously realistic. This story is so epic and so touching that it seems more like a memoir than fiction.In truth, this is one of those books, not unlike ""Gap Creek,"" where the reader is exposed to a whole new world and is able to become almost intimate with all the characters. This novel is filled with hardship, blissful ignorance, and a whole lot of what most of us know as the human condition.The reason I gave this a lower rating is because I found at least thirty misspellings and typo's. Maybe it is the perfectionist in me, but so many mistakes really take away from the flow of the writing.If this is a flaw that you can deal with, I highly recommend this book."
2,Depressing read,"Jewel might be held up as a hero, and in some ways, she deserves that title. But what of her husband, who dies in California instead of back home in Mississippi? What of her other children, who had to live without the kind of attention that they needed from their mother?Every shred of Jewel's life after Brenda Kay was born was spent on tending to a person whose mind would never develop past a six year old's level. Bless her heart, but the story was so depressing. I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't really have a clue as to what being a mother sometimes means: tremendous heartache, small triumphs, loneliness, anger, joy without description, all of it. Read this book before you decide to have a child late in life, for you will see so honestly what it can turn out to be.Was it worth it for Jewel to spend over forty years tending to a large child? Only Jewel, and mothers like her, can say for sure."
2,slow to start,"I found this book very slow to start and hard to get into. The middle is engaging, but by the end I lost interest again. Lott doesn't seem to be quite sure what politically correct issue to tackle - racism, disabled children, sex relations - and seems to skip all over the place without really saying anything. Having said that, this isn't the worst book you could ever read. It's just that there are better ones."
2,Good premise but poorly executed,"Jewel is one of those books that you start with the greatest ambition to read and enjoy. However, once you start, you discover that it is a chore to continue through each chapter. I usually enjoy Oprah picks (with a few poorly written execeptions) but this book moves too slowly and does not invoke any compassion. Who can feel sorry for a woman who obviously feels sorry for herself and neglects everything in her life but her daughter? Bret Lott does not make the book interesting or keep a continual flow."
4,JEWEL,JEWEL shows us how fragile life can be with the struggles of one woman who never gives up on her dream and has the strength that the rest of us could only possibly hope to attain.
4,Jewel,"I thought this was one of the best books I have ever read. It wasn't an overly depressing book about the hardships of raising a mentally retarted child, but instead, a very interesting depiction of life in the 1940's to the present. It gives the reader an interesting perspective of a life most of us have never and will never live"
2,a tough read,"I didn't like this book for several reasons. It is slow moving. The characters have almost no dimension (especially the 5 children except Brenda Kay), and too much space is wasted to say something that could have been said in half the space. I also thought that the substory about Jewel's childhood has no bearing on the story at all and is only mentioned one other time after the story is complete. It would have made a good story in and of itself not combined with this unrelated one about a retarded girl and her mother.I felt Jewel was too afraid of her husband; of telling him what she needed and wanted for their child. Leston was cold and uncaring, not showing much emotion at any time. The children are shallow more times than they are not (except Brenda Kay of course) especially when they get older.I wanted to read this one for a while. Now that I have I'm a little annoyed that I wasted the time and a lot disappointed in what I read."
4,A wonderful book,"This was a wonderful, beautifully written book. I could really feel that I was there with the characters. The setting and characters were very well-developed and the plot was engaging. The reason I give it 4 stars rather than 5 is only because at times it seemed a little slow. But just as I would begin to think that, the plot would pick up again. I found myself getting nostalgic for different times in the book and wanted to read it again when I finished. I highly recommend this book to everyone."
4,Poignant look at a woman's heart,"Bret Lott has captured a woman's heart. Beautifully written, poignant, powerful, forgiving. Unless one has had a disabled person to care for, one can only imagine what that entails. I loved his descriptions, not only about Brenda Kay, but how he describes Jewel's relationships with Leston, James, and her daughters---the sacrifice of those relationships, and yet, the great wisdom and understanding of each member of the household about their relationship to one another! Though the book seems to get a little ""bogged"" down about half-way through (perhaps that is just what the author intended---sometimes our own lives get ""bogged"" down, unmanageable, chaotic, depressing, hopeless, but we continue the struggle), I highly recommend this book to everyone who wants to be touched by the example of Jewel---her constant devotion, strength and energy, determination and dedication, tender love, wisdom and understanding, forgiveness."
1,"Hey, Oprah says its good so it must be!","Right? WRONG! This book blows. Once again, Oprah has recommended a book chock full of psycho-babble and emotional nonsense. Its amazing that her mindless drones don't see through her transparent attempt to turn every couch potato house-frau in America into her personal love slave. Stear clear of this book and all related Oprah-phinalia at all costs! And while you are at it, eat more beef."
2,I am disappointed!!,"I was so excited to start this book. The topic of a family with a handicapped child sounded interesting to me and I have enjoyed many other ""Oprah"" books. I am almost finished and I can't wait to be done with it because the story is just dragging on and on. Maybe this is because I do not like the main character, Jewel, at all and, therefore, feel no sympathy or compassion for her or her family. I am sick of her repeated use of the ""N"" word even if it is authentic to the time period. The southern speech is becoming very irritating and so is their continuing astonishment with California. The story is going no where at this point and there are not many pages left for something even remotely exciting to happen. I don't like this book!!!! I gave it 2 stars because it started out well."
1,didnt like the book. very boring,"it wasnt a very good book. not much action. not much romance, not much anything."
1,way too much hype for this book,"I really don't understand what the rave is all about. ""Jewell"" definitely had its moments but for the most part it drag on and had way too many pointless flashbacks."
2,Not much happens in this book.,"I didn't find this book terribly interesting. The characters did not do much for me, and the story was rather dull."
5,A Must Read!,"This was one of the most refreshing novels I have read in years. It follows the life journey of Jewel Hilburn and her transformation after the birth of her sixth, most challenging child. It begins in Mississippi with the desire for a better life for a retarded child and carries her across the country. The reader watches her children grow, marry, and struggle through their own lives. It is remarkable & sincere."
5,Incredible!,I listened to the audiocassette version of Jewel and was entranced! The reader captured the rhythm and accent of rural Mississippi in such a way that the words of Jewel came alive! I find myself playing back in my mind sections of the book that were especially meaningful to me - I loved this book!
2,"Depressing, rambling read","I found this book to be a bit depressing to read. Not that I only read for fun, but the fact that Jewel set herself up to be the world's biggest martyr and the expectation that her whole family should do the same, left me really sad. Then, when Leston shows his true colors and Jewel accomodates his desires, she undermines everything the plot had set up so far. I found the sub plot about her upbringing much more interesting than the main story."
3,"JEWEL, slow but steady moving.","I agree with most of the reviewers that this is a slow moving story with a great deal of detail(yawn!!). However the main plot of the storyline kept me interested enough to complete this read. I strongly agree with everyone about overusing the ""N"" word, the use of the word ""crackers"" was not used nearly as much; what's up with that? It seems to me that the author enjoyed using the ""N"" word too much and unnecessarily, I found this quite disturbing. What color ""N's"" was the author talking about? Maybe the author needs to look up the ""N"" word in a dictionary(FAST), and discover that the ""N"" word has nothing to do with the race of a certain group of people(what a pleasant surprise)!!"
2,"ok, long-winded",I thought the first half of the book was good. The second half was slow and long-winded. I don't agree that is a good literature book. Perhaps the author has personal experience with someone with Down's syndrome and this book means a lot to him. I didn't find the subject very compelling.
2,A compelling story.,"This is definitely a book worth reading, not only for the moving portrayal of this poor rural family trying to cope with raising a seriously retarded child, but also for its portrait of the region, the sub-culture, race relations, class relations and migration at a particular point in time of our nation's history. Although the story is quite compelling, the writing and characterizations are sometimes a bit trite and maudlin. The book was just a tad too wholesome for me -- family values and all that -- wholesome like Wonderbread. The heroine is just too much at times. Still, I admired her nonetheless. It is basically a good read,the subject matter important and there is a lot to like about this book. You don't have to have children to care about this family. It made me more sensitive to the complex issues and deep personal costs of trying to raise a retarded child. I recommend it."
2,ummm.....,"I had a difficult time trying to decide whether I like the book or not. The plot was touching, Jewel's strong will for her little girl and her motherly love towards to her children. But it was kinda confusing and sometimes it gets boring. I would say that it's a good ""literature"" book, but not a good book to read for fun."
5,jewel,I think the book Jewel that later became a tv movie starring Farrah Fawcett was so touching and well acted. I cried when she had to leave jewel at a special home for kids with Downs syndrom. It was one of Farrah's best performances in my opinion. Hope DVD comes out soon.
4,"Well written, thought provoking book.","I wasn't too anxious to read this book when it was picked for my book club. I was afraid it would be very much along the lines of ""Memory Keeper's Daughter"" (which was not a terrible book, but not one I loved either.) However, it didn't take long, just a few pages actually, for me to be completely sucked into Jewel Hilburn's life. Bret Lott's writing style, utilizing flashback throughout the book, was a wonderful way to understand Jewel and why she made the decisions that she made. I was happy to read a book, set in early 20th century, that actually had a male character with redeeming qualities. Even with all of the problems they faced, Jewel and Leston's relationship was rock solid and based on love and respect. A very refreshing change from most novels..."
2,moves like molasses,"Good writer but I found the book tiring to read, and would drop it for other books while reading, which is something I never do. I found Jewel to a very manipulative, not likeable woman."
1,Struggle to read,"This was a very difficult book to read. I had to force myself to finish it. It just did not seem to ""flow"", I had to re-read several passages. I felt little or no attachment to the characters. I found myself getting annoyed with the main character, Jewel. I found her to be very manipulative and it bothered me that she ignored her entire family for the sake of one child."
3,"A good, but sad story.",A good story of family struggle. The last third of book drags on. Much repeat of earlier text.
1,"Long and drawn out, not enough character development.",Jewell was choosen as reading for our book club. I was dissapointed. I found myself having to reread sentences and I found the book boring. I didn't even bother to finish it. Oprah is about 50/50 on her choices.
4,One of the few fiction books that I've been able to enjoy.,I usually do not read fiction. I happened to see the book reviewed on Oprah and decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did! While I was reading this book I always had a visual - a sign of a truly well-written book.
1,A very slow read.,Jewel was not at all up to par with Oprah's other picks. I was suprised she choose this book because of the language in it. Very offensive.
1,This book is too long and the underdeveloped plot is cliche,The story of this book is that a handicapped child is really a blessing in disguise. There is nothing new in this plot which is too thin and underdeveloped for the number of pages.
1,"It was a big letdown, I was very dissappointed.","I did not like this book at all. Jewel had a horrendous life and I kept thinking that there would be some revelation in the end that would make all of her suffering somehow worthwhile, that she learned some valuable life lesson from her daughter in exchange for all of her suffering, but I was mistaken and I saw no value in this book, I was VERY dissappointed. It seemed to be just a rambling on and on of hard ship after hard ship this poor woman had to find the strength to endure."
4,Thought-provoking and well-written,"I always read Oprah's book club books because she works hard to choose titles which raise our social conciousness while entertaining us with beautifully written prose. I am sorry to read the comments from the reader in Utah. What does he/she mean in the quote, ""we all know what kind of a place Mississippi is""? I do know about Mississippi. It is a state full of honest, hard-working people, much like any other state in our wonderful country. Shame on that reader for being so closed minded, and for perpetuating stereotypes, which is exactly what Oprah hopes she can change through Americans reading her thoughtfully chosen books. Jewel is a book worth reading, because it gives insight into a world which many of us will thankfully never know, the world of raising a child with Downs Syndrome. Oprah, thank you for opening our eyes!"
4,Intriguing Read,"This was a very interesting book that should be read by all. While parts of it were long and tedious, overall it was a great book."
2,A Forgettable Tale,"I had a hard time getting into this book and wanted to put it down permanently but I kept hoping it would improve.First of all, Jewel is no heroine. She seems to put her entire family on the back burner for Brenda Kay. Her treatment of and disregard for Lester and his feelings was selfish and horrible. Furthermore, her blaming Cathedral for Brenda Kay's burns was wrong too. She almost as much as admits that she had to blame someone. I think she should at least acknowledged to herself (and to us readers) that it wasn't all Cathedral's fault. I was disgusted with the way she manipulated Lester to move back to California. Talk about selfishness! No wonder the poor man died of a heart attack!Skip this book. It's a very frustrating read."
1,ZZzzzzzzz,"Being a Special Education teacher I thought this book would be right up my alley. Unfortunately, I found it to be depressing and unbearably monotonous. Half way through the book I couldn't take it anymore. I did what is very rare for me and quit reading it."
1,Reader from NJ who has read most of Oprah's books,"I like to read the Oprah books because I'm always looking for something good to read. I loved Where the Heart Is, liked Midwives a lot, and have read and enjoyed many others (but not all). I'm always excited to find out the new book and I have Amazon.com email the selection before it is announced in NJ. Then I quickly call my library and reserve it for myself before anyone else. Well, I was quite disappointed in this one. I'm glad to see that it was not just me who found this book extremely slow. I almost put it down but did trudge through to the end. I'm not recommending it to the other Oprah readers I know. I completely agree with the first reviewer from Milton, NH about the language. Is the correct term for this that it was written in the passive voice? Whatever it was, this book was extremely difficult to get through and took me a long time. There are so many other fabulous books that Oprah could choose from."
4,Jewel always does what needs to be done. I loved this book!,"I loved this book. Jewel's evolution from girl child to grandmother was wonderful. She had a painful childhood but decided that she wasn't going to perpetuate that pain through her adulthood. Her strength, her dedication, and her love of family was very powerful. Her ignorance about calling her friends in Mississippi ""niggers"" until she was corrected by a California Doctor was taken with such grace and understanding. She never uttered the word again. Although she never meant any disrespect, she understood. This is not a fluff book by any means. It makes me proud of modern literature."
3,too much,This novel was o.k. The story line was rather interesting (Mother's love for and committment to her handicapped child) but I didn't care for the writing style; too repetitive...drove me crazy! The same thoughts were repeated over and over and over and ov...........
2,Made me weary,"This is the first Oprah book I have not liked. I thought therewere some interesting things in it, but I found it veryfairy-tale-like, despite the hardships. The characters were flat -- they were all so good, so sacrificing, so helpful to each other. No bad seed amongst 6 children -- not even any complaints -- not even any resentment of the attentions focused on the retarded child? It didn't seem real. The book is also too long, too many flashbacks where you question the relevance, and too much attention to irrelevant detail."
4,Oprah picks another good one,"Truly wonderful novel about a poor white family in 1940's Mississippi who give birth to their 6th child and discover soon thereafter that she has Down's Syndrome. The child quickly becomes both a burden and the greatest of God's gifts for the family as they are forced to adapt and shift their lives to accommodate hers. Ultimately, the child is the force that changes them all for the better, that forces them from a life of quiet backwoods-living to a life of exhilarating small steps towards a greater future -- ""God smiling and smiling and smiling.""I really enjoyed this book, though I'll admit I have a few criticisms. Over all, I think reading this book can teach people something valueable about life -- the true test of whether something is ""literature"" or not."
3,book needed more character development,"I never felt like I knew any of the characters in the book, except perhaps Jewel. She and her husband never had any meaningful conversations. In fact, I don't think Leston did anything at all except roll up cigarettes and smoke them. How many times did we have to read that over and over again? He was so non-verbal. He calls her ""sug"" a few times and that is enough to satisfy her."
1,What was Oprah thinking!,Brett Lott's novel Jewel is the story of a mother's plight to save her retarded daughter. This book is vastly over-rated. The plot is more TV movie of the week than great literature. The family experiences tragedy after tragedy that they have to overcome with love and faith. The novel's worst flaw is that all this tragedy fails to emotional engage the reader and the love will conquer all theme gets sickening really quickly.
1,ugh...Oprah save me!,"I found this novel difficult, wordy and unbelievable. I tried desperately to know the characters; understand them, feel as though I could relate to their experience...no such luck. I struggle with men writing about women's experiences-particularly motherhood and childbirth. (As in Wally Lamb's also unbelievable She's Come Undone) This book continues my struggle, because in college, I learned you write what you know; I don't feel Bret Lott knew this subject."
2,"Shorter Sentences, Please","I am only 30 pages into this book, and already I can tell it will be a struggle to finish. I can't stand the way the sentences are structured! It's like this, me sitting here typing away at my computer while my husband watches TV, his glasses glimmering in the lamp light, and me eating Triscuits, thinking I could find someone else who noticed how darn long and hard to follow the sentences are. The story and characters seem interesting, so I will try to finish it..."
4,Liked it a lot,"While I did enjoy this book, I did not love it. I liked the subject matter but but the book was down right boring at times. To the person in Utah, shame on you for being as bigoted as you think Mississippi is racist. And book banning? Give me a break. Oprah warned you that the N word was used a lot. I can not imagine why you would think that this book should be banned."
3,"Grabbed my attention, but . . .","It's not that I didn't like this book. For the most part, I didn't want to put it down -- and couldn't wait to pick it up again. However, after about 200 pages the story began to fizzle. Almost every paragraph seemed to repeat the same thoughts. It became predictable and a bit overdone. However, Jewel's childhood experiences were particularly enthralling, and the development of her character was perfectly done. Lott is also masterful at pulling you into a time and place. All in all, it was a unique exploration into the choices women make, the prejudices toward the disabled and African Americans, and how slowly these things change. Jewel is an excellent characterization of a strong woman, a survivor, and a loving mother. The fact that she had to sacrifice her relationships with the rest of her family in order to ""save"" Brenda Kay is a sad commentary on the truth about the choices women must make."
1,What Ever!,"My God, what a laborious read! Certainly the worst of Oprah's choices to date. A very slow and deliberate read only to be disappointed at the end. .. straight through to the Epilogue, a consistent disappointment. The story line had so much potential. I was looking forward to being transported to an experience of a family with a Downs Syndrome child. What I got was a sophomoric attempt to massage the heart into actually feeling something for these persona-less characters and their lives. In my opinion, Lott didn't do this subject matter justice at all."
3,A disappointing choice,"As a reader who monitors all of Oprahs' book selections, I found Jewel to be somewhat disappointing. I would have preferred to see the characters developed in greater detail. Specifically, I would have expected to have a greater understanding of the way Jewel's mind worked, given the amount of flashbacks. But these were not developed well. For example, Why did Mrs. Faulk (at the Industrial School) choose to take such an interest in making sure Jewel had a future? Also, I agree with another reader who missed the development of Brenda Kay's character. However, Lott did write several beautiful passages such as ""the only true victory any mother could hope for; the looking of a child, whether retarded or not, to you for what wisdom you could give away..."" which, for me, made finishing the book, despite the Southern dialogue and extensive flashbacks, worthwile."
1,A Huge Waste of Time,"I am only about half way through this book, after being at it for about a week. It usually takes me 2 or 3 days to finish a book of this length. I keep struggling with myself as to whether to continue or not -- I even CHOSE to scrub out my tub instead of reading this book one quiet afternoon last week. Like a lot of other reviewers who did not like the book, I am frustrated by the sentence structure and the Southern dialect -- what is with all the words ending with 'd?!! I also object to the use of the 'N' word. I have read a lot of Southern literature and have never encountered the use of that word as frequently as Brett Lott uses it in this book. As Atticus Finch told Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird (a TRUE literary masterpiece), using the 'N' word is 'common.' I am beginning to doubt Oprah's choices."
5,JEWEL Is a Jewel,"In rural Mississippi lives a simple woman with her husband and their five children. Their life continues year after year, in the slow, rhythmic routine of the south. Everything changes when their sixth child is born. Jewel knows something is wrong with her little girl. Brenda Kay is born in 1943 with Down's Syndrome. During the postwar period, little was known about the chromosomal disorder and the treatment of these children with special needs. When the doctor tells her to institutionalize her precious, but different, child, she refuses, believing that what her daughter truly needs is love. Thus begins her fight for her daughter.Sensitively written, this book is filled to the brim with realistic characters and vivid settings. Narrated by Jewel, this is an extremely moving book about a simple woman's faith in the power of love and family. This book is just beautiful!"
4,Empathy for the Less fortunate,"Many of us have encoundered mentally challenged individuals sometime in our lives. But untill this book I never could empathize with having a Down Syndrome child of my own. This book stars slow but develops into a complex web of financial, personal, and spiritual decisions. You end up loving and admiring Jewel for her perserverance and love for life dispite all the pain she endures. If you need to escape into the heart of of woman, Jewel is a great read. As a man, I found it facinating!"
2,Was determined to get to the end,"It was a struggle but I did finish this book. I realize Jewel's Down's syndrome child needed her but not to the detriment of the rest of her family. I felt so sad for Annie, who still was a baby herself when the new baby came along. After all she went through to get to California and all the progress she made, I couldn't understand why she would go back to Mississippi with her husband. And, finally, I wondered why her husband didn't die of lung cancer with all the cigarettes he smoked throughout the book. Yes, Oprah does it again! Another depressing book."
2,*Yawn*,"I'll have to agree with the other review, saying it started very slowly. I, too, was waiting for the next page to be more interesting, faster paced, but it never did happen. The story plods along, too slow to even be predictable. Not very realistic, either. Don't bother buying, go get some Nytol instead."
4,AN EXCEPTIONALLY WELL-WRITTEN NOVEL!,"This novel is definitely not for the Danielle Steel crowd. It has a great deal of depth and substance. It is full of frustration and pathos. It is about the very depths of a mother's suffering heart. Yes, Jewel short changed the other members of her family due to the birth of a defective daughter, but human beings are imperfect, and they do not always deal with difficult situations in a perfect fashion. I was mesmerized by the unfolding of this beautifully written, heartbreaking story."
4,inspirational,I read this book about a year ago..I have a challenged child so I know some of what that family went through..Thank God times have changed and all children can be treated and educated equally.
2,"Weak, undeveloped characters, dysfunctional family","This book was chosen for our book club and I thought it could have been much better than it was. I did like the fact that he did not ""correct"" the language that they used or how they thought. However, I think Jewel was controlling and neglected her family for one child. I just didn't see the great mother-daughter relationship or her struggle with her god. I would have liked the story to have gotten perspectives from other family members. Good thing was that it really brings awareness to those who are mentally and/or physically challenged."
4,A Rare Book that shows how precious and swift life is,"Bret Lott's book Jewel is an example of how family and marriage are the cornerstones of our lives. His images are conveyed through Jewel, a strong heroine that sacrafices much but still stays grounded in the end with the memory of her ""lives"" from childhood to adulthood and all of her ""Befores"". I found it amazing how strong Leston and Jewel's marriage was and how they survived the struggle of raising a child with Down Syndrome at at time when little was known about it. The author shows us how important family is, the trials of motherhood and the swiftness of life's circle."
4,As close to five stars without being five stars,"What a lovely little book this one is. Jewel is a book in a time where sex, language and violence play a huge part in what determines literature that manages to provide a moving story with very little of the aforementioned. It is well written, interesting and a book that manages to introduce characters you care about. I had problems with ""She's Come Undone"" by Wally Lamb because I didn't think he managed to write successfully as a female but there are no such problems with Jewel. Lott has written a nice little book that restores a little faith in Oprah and her selections."
4,"Long, but worth the time to read!","Thr first half of this book was a bit tedious, but the second half was energizing and encouraging. I have never had any experience with Down's Syndrome, and this novel made it a little more ""real"" for me. Jewel is a great character, but her husband Lester was a bit of a mystery to me. He seemed fairly selfish and unsupportive of the rest of the family. In the middle I was frustrated with the length of the book, but by Book 2 was engrossed."
3,Difficult to get through,"Brett Lott's Jewel was a well-written story, but not specifically tuned to my taste. I guess the fact that it was so slow and syrupy made it a difficult read. I like to read a book with twists and turns or something to keep me interested, and all this book could provide were gentle bends. I also found it to be quite predictable -- there was no element of surprise. Artistically, Lott did well, but he could have written that story just as well in half the amount of words."
1,THIS BOOK IS NO GEM!,"I bought this book in a rush and should have considered it a bit longer ... reading it only confirmed this ... the main character is pathetically dull ... I couldn't stand hearing about ""Leston"" this and ""Leston"" that ... this book should have remained a rough draft and then ended up on the cutting room floor ... in fact I ended up skipping from about 2/3 way through it to the ending, it was that impossible to finish. I will never pick up another book by this author again!!!!! warning- Stay Away From This One!!!!!"
3,Interesting philosophical exercise,"This book is not about a martial arts technique or style, per se. It is more about mind set and internal focus, bordering on the mystical. It may indeed be helpful to the advanced martial artist, but is closer to a study of the zen-like focusing of the internal energy, utilizing the intrinsic power of the earth, etc.The text is difficult to follow at times as the author thrashes about for definitions for his concepts. This is not surprising as the concepts he tackles may be difficult for folks with Judeo-Christian backgrounds to grasp.When all is said and done, it is for the reader to decide if the mind-over-matter techniques and focus on connecting with the power within the Earth (Chi) will actually be of any help in their own study of the Martial Arts.Although overall it reads like a self-help tome, try it, you may like it."
4,"Essential Reading for Every ""Seeker"" of Spiritual Expansion","This is an imperative handbook for anyone who is working with higher realms. Every word counts and every sentence is loaded with information. It speaks not only to stages of development of spiritual sight, but also to the importance of not ""going beyond where you already are."" It is filled with stern advice on the importance of staying grounded as one develops spiritually. After reading this, I recognize how much of my spiritual learning was by ""groping in the dark"" and Steiner admonishes that this is definitely not the most productive path! Practical, thoughtful, provocative, and I would add essential to any student of esoteric training."
5,The Teacher came and told me to get this book,"It is said that; ""when the student is ready the Teacher will come."" Well the teacher came and has illuminated many paths to inner enlightenment, Theosophy, BOTA, Freemasonry, Ritual Magic, Sufism and more. I have worked within all of these groups with a mentor of great wisdom and patience who just kept lighting the way.Through this book I found the path and the blueprint for building my spiritual temple. Looks like others have found the same light."
2,Modern?,"I was torn between giving this two or three stars. I haven't finished it and probably won't. I was looking for a book that is not too expensive or voluminous that explains the teachings of Rudolf Steiner.His ideas are very much of the product of his times and reflect the 19th century take on spirituality and sounds influenced by Theosophy and many aspects of 19th century thought that were mere charlatanism.That said, there is some takeaway from the book but you have to really slough through it to understand it in 21st century mindset. I'm still looking for a good summary of his work and ideas. He must have been avery inspirational person and was obviously very intelligent, accomplished and helpful to others."
1,"Abridged, bad translation","Do not get this version of this book. It is difficult to read, and apparently abridged. Make sure to getHow to Know Higher Worlds: A Modern Path of Initiation (Classics in Anthroposophy), the one with the watercolor on the cover. It is the complete and ""official"" version. My mentor had me go back through and read the other edition, which ended up being much easier to for me to understand. He had never heard of this publisher before. I have had difficulty with several Steiner books on Amazon. I recommend just going to the publisher's website, Steinerbooks.com, and ordering from there."
5,Should Be A Required Piece Of Equipment,"This is the smaller version of the 12-inch protractor, and is a tool more suited to my apron pocket, where it resides with their 6-inch T-square. It is as precise a tool as you could ask for, easy to use one handed, and invaluable for checking the alignment of tools before you make a mistake. It's the perfect protractor for in the shop, smaller work, where the 12-inch model's size makes it a bit unwieldy. It won't cut wood for you, but it will help you make sure that what you want is what you get."
2,Accuracy is everything,"I bought this to use in tandem with the larger Starrett 505A-12 ProSite Protractor. My miters have to be perfect everytime. The 505A-12 is a very good buy, but the decal on the 505A-7 is about 2 degrees off. I waited too long to send it back, so it will only serve me as a marking tool. If you aren't concerned with accuracy, you have no need for a tool like this. So be prepared to return it in a timely manner if the decal is off."
2,The second is worse than the first,"This item is a super idea....to bad it's not a super product. I returned the first one I bought because it was obvious that the decal was not accurate. I was nearly 2 deg. off. This may be ok when building a highway, but not quality trim installations. The replacement was worse than the original. Now I may have to wait as much as two weeks to get my money back, after I return the second one for a refund. Thats about a month since I originally paid for the first one, with no product worth paying for. What a shame."
2,Too expensive for not measuring outside corners.,Too expensive for not measuring outside corners. Waste of money. Buy the flat more expensive one instead. Why did they made a dumb protractor like this one?
3,Not the greatest...,"This is not quite the tool is should be. It works reasonably well for inside corners, less well for outside corners. And the scale is poor. Face it, you need a tool that will tell you that the 45 deg angle is really 44 degrees, for example, and the scale is so coarse that it is no better than guessing. Even with this tool, you'll still scribe to fit. Overpriced for the capability, in my opinion."
3,Thought they fixed that.,"Having worked in and around machine shops all my life, the name Starrett became synonymous with quality. Recently, however, I purchased a Starrett Miter Saw Protractor model 505A-7 and was shocked to find that Starrett is no long is concerned about accuracy. The instrument I purchased was clearly off my at least one half degree while the package label screams ""laser engraved accuracy"". My research indicates Starrett knows of this issue and has chosen to ignore it; seems wood workers do not ""require accuracy"" according to Starrett.This could have been a really great new product. It is novel and well made but I would advise Starrett to track down the person in their organization that developed it and ""fire"" him. Everything a company produces reflects that company's image and this one says Starrett has developed a new business strategy, ""caveat emptor ""."
4,Starrett ProSite Protractor 505A-7,"Overall, a very good product. Easy to use and easy to read scales. Would be better if one of the legs was offset so that both legs would sit flat to the surface during use rather than having to keep pressure on the one leg to keep tool from rocking over."
3,Great till the ending. Then its like left field.,great book till the end. the auther evens says in acknowldgements if it werent for so and so this book would not have an ending. other then that its a good read.
2,"Orff: Carmina Burana/Ormandy, Harsanyi, Petrak, et al [SACD]","If you are buying this disc because it is recorded in SACD format, don't bother. Based upon the other SACDs I have I expected a top notch recording. It is not. I'm not sure if its a function of the recording process itself or something in the way it was transfered to SACD, but there is a very high level of hiss that is dramatic and distracting at high volume levels. Also, the vocals are somewhat muddled. I would say that a standard CD with a better recording would sound better."
4,Great detail as expected but unexpected hiss,"I totally understand what people are saying about the hiss in the recording being ok due to recording methods, but I also do not expect to hear hiss on a SACD. Perhaps if I had know about the his I would have been prepared and not so dissappointed. I have this music on CD and SACD and I can tell you, if the hiss won't bother you the CD recording is not nearly as good as the SACD recording. Its kind of like compare a good tape recording to a CD Player back when CD players were new.If you are looking for a good first SACD to buy with your new SACD player, get a different SACD, but if you don't mind the his and you love Carmina Burana this will still be the best recording with the greatest detail."
2,Singing Pablo isn't very much fun.,I am very disapointed with this toy. It says 2 phrases and sings 1 song only. The button to make the toy talk/sing is very hard for small children to find. And it doesn't interest the child for very long.
4,Cute Toy if Your Kid likes the show!,"My 2 year old daughter loves the Backyardigans' Surf's Up episode, so she loves this doll. She carries it around and sings Surf's Up along to it. Very cute and definitely great value at the Amazon price!"
5,Woo hoo! A Success!,"I'd chosen this toy for a young man who lives overseas and who is learning English simultaneously with his native language. I thought a fun talking penguin would be just the thing, and I've heard from his mom that he loves it. I thought Pablo was adorable when I packed him up for shipping, and I am thrilled that Alexander loves him too."
4,"Loud and hard, but one of my daughter's favorite characters...","I was glad to see this toy, but I didn't realize how hard it would be! It is not flexible, soft or cuddly and it IS loud. It only plays 2 songs which will grate on your nerves eventually.I gave it 4 stars overall because it is very durable, has stood up to many lovings (er, beatings) from my 2.5 and 5 yr old daughters."
4,These Catholics,"Catholics don't like what they have read, so, of course, they ""deny"" it. They don't even realize WHO actually WROTE this book; along with the other 4 volumes. It is a Religious, as well as political-ACT, to use ""plausible-deniability,"" when the truth is called into question. Only a total fool, would deny these books. Written by Mrs. Roosevelt herself! ""Avro Manhattan"" is a sudo-name, not a REAL personage."
1,Ridiculous and absurd book.,"About ten years ago, a brazilian pentecostal give a lot of anti-catholic book, to me.Among then, was this ""trash-book"" called Catholic Imperialism and World Freedom.This book is so bad, that I never finished it.I returned this trash-book to his owner.The core idea of this book is that Catholic Church is, the greatest menace to World's freedom.An absurd, ridiculous and senseless idea.In fact ever freedom's enemy is also a Pope's enemy.See Bin Laden, Iran's Aiatollahs,etc.I don't know if the author of this book, Avro Manhattan, is a mad or simple, he is a bigot.Maybe he is both of then."
1,This man is a crack pot.,If you take anything this dingaling writes as fact then do I have prime relastate in Antarctica to sell you. WHOOOO BOY! Does this guy reach. His ideas on Catholicism is right up there with the idea that jews are secretly conspiring to rule the world. Don't waste your time with this garbage. It is utterly amazing that anyone could take this guy seriously. I would have given this book 0 stars but it 0 stars is not an option.
1,I can understand why a radical atheist. . .,". . .might feel threatened by the Catholic Church (or any other large religious body, for that matter) but it stuns me that any seriousness at ALL is taken of this book.No one would suggest that the Catholic Church (or any other institution) is free from all fault -- but to suggest that ""Catholic Imperialism"" is the greatest threat to world freedom, especially in this day and age, is just silliness..."
5,yay,"this cd is good.makes me smile. if doesnt make you smile you got issues. great rhymes, pleasent beeats."
4,Really useful,"This is a splurge item, but a practical one. Having easy access to hot water for quick drinks or anything that you'd have to boil water for is really nice.Maintains a good constant heat and dispenses it safely."
2,Not worth it,"I was very disappointed with this product. The airpump is hard to push and you have to press a lot of times to get one cup of hot water. Also, the lid just fell out when I tried to refill it. Spend a little more to buy the automatic electric pump."
2,Older stargazing book.,"Did a quick scan through the book, would not reorder or recommend this one. Can view much better pictures right off the web."
4,Jones's take on well-known covers,"This recording is seemingly a compilation of mid-to-late '70s recordings, some of them concert performances. These are classic pop songs, and good performances of them by one of pop-rock's classic vocalists. Overall, worthwhile listening.Program:""I (Who Have Nothing)""""My Way""""Ebb Tide""""The Impossible Dream (The Quest)""""Ain't No Sunshine""""If""""You've Got A Friend""""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'""""Bridge Over Troubled Water"""
2,Toys,"These radios do not work well. They do not transmit well unless you are on a flat plain area. We bought them for our cruise and could not communicate on the ship. Also, by the end of the trip, one of the radios had no display and won't turn off without taking out the batteries. I would not recommend these."
5,My favorite for the house,This is my 4 pair....love them. They are very comfortable. The air-holes in the top piece of the shoe keeps them from getting hot like other solid sperry type shoes.
4,Buen diseño y duracion,"Son muy comodos y poseen un excelente diseño, son resistentes y no presenta problemas por la humedad. Buena elección."
1,THESE ARE NOT GOLF SHOES!,"These are great shoes to lounge around in, but they are NOT slip on golf shoes,despite the fact that they are being sold as golf shoes!"
5,very comfty,My husband's favorite sneakers. He has worn them for a couple years and we keep ordering more for him. Neutral color makes them versatile
5,PRAISE BREAK,"One of the songs on the album, JUST WANT TO PRAISE YOU, has the most wonderful beat to a song that I have ever heard. It is so loved at my church, that we have incorporated it into our worship service every Sunday. Its word are ever so true, that we should THANK HIM and PRAISE HIM for all that he has done for us. GOD BLESS YOU, MAURETTE and may he keep on using one in song."
2,No Worky!,"Mine stopped working after 15 months. The temperature on the display was always 10 degrees higher than the actual. Also, the back-lighting never worked from the beginning. I threw mine away and would not recommend it."
3,Stopped Working After a Year,"I bought this to know what to wear when I go running in the early morning. It worked pretty well for just over a year. After I replaced the batteries I started to have to reset it every few days, then every two days, then every day. Was hoping it would last longer but I guess a year is all you can expect from electronic devices these days.Never could get the automatic clock set function to work. Don't think it is the unit's fault as my son got an alarm clock with similar feature for Xmas, and it does not work either. Might be our location (Northern California). I may replace it with an old-fashioned mechanical thermometer that I can stick to the outside of a window."
5,Always wanted one of these,"I received this as a Christmas gift, it's awesome. I set it up without even looking at the instructions, the features are great too. I find it strange you need to use a screwdriver to put the batteries in the transmitter (rather than just a typical hand-operating locking mechanism), but no big deal. Only wish is that it came with a radio!"
5,Musician's musician,"Well, I'm going to add my voice to the chorus.As I write, there are no musical samples available on Amazon; but I saw the glowing reviews. Then I read that Julie was Eamonn Doorley's fiancée, and I thought, OK, he probably plays on her album: I'll take a chance.I couldn't be more happy. Her voice is glorious. The other musicians read like a cross-section of all that's best in folk music, but the accompaniments never overwhelm or compete with the vocals, as they sometimes did with (for instance) Sólas. The arrangements, in which I can definitely detect the John McCusker touch, are wonderful, and both the original lyrics and translations are provided. The recording is crystal clear.Try this for a first approximation. Imagine Kate Rusby singing in Gaelic, with John McCusker and Danú backing her. If you think you would like the result, than this album is for you.The total time is 43'06""."
5,Excellent new voice..,Ms Fowlis is a great new voice that I hope will find her way to more American homes and on the Celtic music circut here in the US. Her voice is a wonderful representation of the Scottish Gaelic culture that has been missing in the market of late. Any of her CDS should belong in a serious Celtic music collectors library. While recently in Scotland we watched a documentary about her and her band and were impressed with her poise and love of not only the music but the culture of Scotttish Islands. She is truly a welcome ambassador for the Scottish Gaelic Community.
5,sublime modernized celtic music,The artist's voice is clear and crisp and the musical arrangements are both fluid and fresh.
1,Boring,They basically just demonstrate a few exercises and thats it. It also looks like it was filmed in the backyard of someone's house.
5,Great for beginners!,"I bought a set of kettlebells recently and I wanted a workout that would be great for the beginner. After many hours of research, and reading the reviews on Iron Core, I decided to go ahead and purchase these. This is a great set! The first DVD is simple enough for this beginner! I also worked out to the bootcamp, and I felt like it was a great workout! So if you are new to kettlebells, I highly recommend this!"
2,Not for me,"Way too many pauses between the workouts. You do a full set of exercises then you rest for far too long. Then you repeat. I found it annoying. I want a constant routine. I don't mind a few seconds to recoup here and there, but this was ridiculous."
4,Kettlebell,Good for beginner and intermediate. Clear instructions. Didn't realize there were 4 dvd's. have a 15 lb kettlebell which is plenty for a 50-something!
2,dont like this at all,I am so bored by this video. bought it because of all the favorable reviews and found myself fast forwarding constantly. after every exercise there is a 30 second wait time which is annoying. I wish I had purchased a different disc
4,Great Value!,This is quite a workout. Didn't realize that you have to snap your body quite so hard. I will use it once or twice a week. Wonderful value for the money as it includes multiple disks.
2,Not great,"This wasn't great, the boot camp was just one series of moves repeated 4 times. Low budget filming, not great"
4,Very Good,"I'm very pleased with this DVD & this workout. I just wished I had the motivation to do it 3 - 4 times per week. It is very easy to understand and the instructor is great. Most people say to start with a 12-15 lb kettlebell. I started with an 8, but wished I would have gotten a little heavier one. Oh well. Kettlebells sold seperately so you'll have to find a good one."
5,Great Workout,I recommend this to anyone starting out with kettlebells. The moves are clearly demonstrated and easy to understand. Would recommend to all beginners.
5,Great set for the money,I have used 3 out of the 4 videos in this set and like all of them. Great for a beginner getting into the traditional style of kettlebell training (heavy KB with lower amounts of swings). I like that they are quick and to the point and get the job done. The price is amazing as well.
5,Great Kettlebell DVD,"I purchased this dvd because I have been unable to attend my regular kettlebell (KB)class because my schedule changed. I had been going to class for over a year and really enjoyed it. This dvd set is great for me. There is a good intro dvd for those not familiar with KB exercises, and a few workouts for those more experienced. I found it challenging and I am sure those more experienced than me will too. It's a great value for the money."
2,Good value but not practical for weak knees,"I was excited about these dvds and ready to try out my kettebell. I did not make it past the warm up on the first disc. I am young, in good shape but have a problem with my knees. I could not handle all the rolling around on the floor that was required for the warm up.I cannot give an opinion on the product as a whole because I quit after the first warm up. I do not suggest this video for people with knee problems. The warm up exercises put tremendous load on the knee joint, and that's not a safe way to start a work out."
4,Kettlebells are a great way to workout,I do like the video.....only did two of the four workouts so far. But you do feel the workout in your muscles. Would recomend and the price was Great!
2,ok but not great,Not enough warm-up and some of the moves are hard on the back and knees if you are not really super careful and you have to be careful on your own....no safety instruction.
3,A good Product,The price was competitive and the shipping was free. The chimney cap was stainless steel and it has held up in the Hawaiian rainforest for the last four months without any signs of corrosion. The only disappointing part was the lack of a spark arresting screen which I thought was included.
4,Not quite Wonder Woman...,I've been on a 70's kick recently and for the price this ISIS DVD collection was something I couldn't pass up. I used to watch ISIS and CAPTAIN MARVEL in the late 70's and upon viewing these shows again they sure don't live up to the memory I had of them. Still if you are looking to relive a bit of your childhood or share it with your kids the stories provide good morality lessons for the young ones once they stop laughing at the crude special effects.I would recommend Wonder Woman over this any day. The production values and acting aren't quite top of the line but this isn't bad at all if you're looking for some retro fun. Also the show features a young Joanna Cameron and there's nothing wrong with that at all.
5,I remember this show from the 1970s,"I enjoyed this show as a kid. Seeing it again brings back memories. Today the show appears to have very silly story lines and crude special effects. However, this show is suitable for children. The violence is mild to say the least. The main characters are good role models."
4,I didn't purchase this exact one.,"I purchased the complete series, it was a real trip down memory lane. Growing up in the 70's, you had so many good shows to watch and this is one of them. Along with SHAZAM! this was must watch Saturday morning tv! One disappointing thing is that there is no interview with Isis herself, Joanna Cameron."
3,Oh Mighty Isis..........,"When a archaeology teacher (JoAnna Cameron)unearthed an ancient Egyptian amulet, she learns that the item was a magic piece of great power. So, whenever there is trouble, she dons the amulet and chants, ""Oh Mighty Isis"". With that, she transforms into the Egyptian goddess, Isis.The early 70's was the heyday of Saturday Morning TV. From the people that brought you such cheese as ""Shazam"" and The Real Ghostbusters, comes Iris.Being around 9 when this came out, I distinctly remember Joanna Cameron giving me a funny feeling,' you know... down there!And looking at it now.........wowShe was insanely hot!my first crush. Sigh.Oh Mighty JoAnna.........For anyone else thinking of buying this, expect low budget, cheeseball cornyness at it mecca."
5,"gracias, don Claudio. (Thanks, Mr. Arrau)","Pollini? Gilels? Richter? Perl? Kempff? Schnabel? Brendel?NO; ARRAU. this time the Chilean hero of the pianoforte is invencible.Ludwig van Beethoven is God and Arrau his prophet.Also try : Liszt: Études d'exécution trascendanteSonata in B minorDebussy: the final sessions (suite Bergamasque, pour le piano, valse romantique)"
4,"When I was a Kid, This was a Free Country",Good book w/ great details of things eroded to where they are...
3,Liddy sounds better than this book reads,"Beware of seductive titles. I was intrigued enough to buy the book but then I was disappointed. Liddy comes across too much like the testosterone-loaded, old-fashioned curmudgeon than an enlightened conservative. He overstates his premise, back ""when I was a kid"". His views on women are most troubling, even to other conservatives. Some of what he writes makes sense. There are many basic, 'American' values worthy of attention and possible restoration. In fact, there is much with which any basic conservative, even centrist could agree. But Liddy barks and sometimes bites, when he could be charming and convincing. I apprecate his knowledge, education and experience. I can even appreciate his sense of loyalty, duty and honor -- in or out of jail. But, for me, this book needed a greater sense of perspective."
2,does Liddy have the moral authority to criticize anybody?,"I have to agree with Liddy's assessment of political correctness, which is a good idea but implemented with a kind of social fascism that is all too common. However, the hypocrisy of Liddy defending American values is kind of sickening. For some reason, we want to idolize people like Oliver North and G. Gordon Liddy, those simple honest American soldiers who are just following orders, even when those orders subvert the Constitution of the United States."
4,Double-barreled Liddy,"This is a straight-forward, shoot to kill, double-barreled dose of the G-Man. Even the Washington Post gave him a decent review."
4,A man among men,"I have heard Liddy on his radio show a few times, I considered myself a fan. This book has upgraded my opinion of him to the point that I consider him a true American hero...standing up for common sense and American values with the kind of stubborn indignation that has made him a true leader. If you read this book, you will enjoy it thoroughly, even if you don't share his thoughts on education, the military, and the environment. Liddy is an dynamic and fascinating self made man."
1,A Romantic Past for the Priviledged,"Gordon Liddy tries to make us think that the immediate past in the U.S. is better than what it is now in all respect. This is the past before the Civil Rights movements that in a limited way opened the gates of liberties to some marginal groups and attempted to create a more egalitarian society. He wants reader to think that during the 1930s, 40s and 50s U.S. citizens were really free. Without a historian's critical skills, which would reveal that minorities and women had little civil rights, he will inevitable fall into the trap of blind conservatism that attempt to use history to justify an unfair social justice."
5,An Honest Look at U. S. Cultural Changes in the 20th Century,"The main idea, that the U. S. is less free today, seems sadly and obviously true. Liddy pokes fun at some of contemporary American's sacred cows. He always seems hold on to his sense of humor. It's to bad everyone else can't do the same."
5,great book ....,"my kids are experiencing liberalism today ... they can't go outside without being yelled at from somebody for something (scooters, climbing trees, toy guns etc) ....and we wonder why kids today sit in front of computer and play video games!!!they can't do anything else !!!!Great book but sad book ....always good to know there are others out there that get it ..."
1,What freedom?,"When Gordon Liddy was a kid, black people couldn't drink out of the same water fountains as white people, to say nothing of the other frequently violent indignities associated with segregation across the U. S. South. The America of his childhood may have been ""free"" for him but it wasn't for a whole lot of other people."
3,Higher Expectations,"The title deceived me into believing Mr. LIddy would provide more details as to ""that was then - this is now"". While he provided some, there was not nearly enough.Too many names of people jumped at me from the page. Names I don't know - nor names I really care to know.While I appreciated the book and learned some things too......there are better."
1,Talk about a dinosaur!,"Yeah, when I was a kid Blacks could not walk on the sidewalk or sit anyplace they liked on the bus. Now that's freedom. Women could not hold many jobs and and a river in Ohio caught fire because factories were free to dump whatever garbage they liked in it. Hey, I really want the old days back, especially those hoped for by a felon who attempted to subvert the freedom of the American voter."
1,linguistics book,"awful. very boring book on a potentially very interesting subject, catalogs the way different cultures communicate, but either goes way too far into depth about certain things, or just skims the very top of the interesting things. a bad book for class for the individual for anyone"
5,"A great,informative read",I found this book to reveal so much about this troubled man. I could not believe the thoughts he had about life. I really enjoyed reading it though.
3,Grapevine...Suck On That One!,If your looking for a good Gaye bio pick up ''GRAPEVINE'' by Sharon Davis. It combines the best parts of this book...and ''GRAPEVINE'' is a smoother read.
5,Map of a troubled mind,"A great history of american popular music and a portrait of a man whose lifeis hard to understand, but this book manages to drive you through a difficult and fascinating journey."
5,An intimate and honest look at the life of Marvin Gaye.,"""Divided Soul"" thoughtfully illustrates the life of Marvin Gaye through the eyes of an objective and perceptive observer.Author Ritz reflects Gaye's life with honesty and candor. Ritz had been Marvin's biographer and friend for many years, and the countless hours they spent together shows through in the very personal and in-depth look into the life of Motown's most popular and controversial male artist.This book offers very interesting candid insight into Marvin Gaye's life from birth to his untimely death, and is highly recommended reading.Review by Son Dexter"
5,3 Times,"I read this book three times. I don't read anything three times! If you want to know about the man, the music, his life, you must read this book. We have the music of this legend, but you will feel his words, his life coming through each page. I'm glad we have this book since Marvin is long gone. This is a must read!"
5,BRILLIANT!,"This book is brilliant and beautiful. You really do have to read it, then you will understand-- it's like poetry."
2,Fair Romance / Mystery set on fictional Swahili island,"Tucker Malarkey's ""An Obvious Enchantment"" is a decent effort, especially for a first novel, but it is not a book I can highly recommend. By the time the book ends, it's clear that it has made more promises than it has kept. The characters and atmosphere are a bit better than the plot and the dialogue. The bit about an ancient African king bringing Islam to Eastern Africa didn't make the book as interesting as I had hoped. There are better romances, better mysteries, and better books about Eastern Africa."
5,An Obvious Enchantment,"I fell under the spell of An Obvious Enchantment as soon as the protagonnist, Ingrid Holtz, landed in Kenya. I have been to Kenya, and Malarkey's descriptions brought back vivid images of tropical Africa to mind. And the characters that populate this rich atmosphere could have been people I, too, met; they were crystal clear in my mind's eye. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Africa and anyone who wants a good read."
5,A Cinematic Personal Journey,"This novel's rich prose, stunning descriptions of place and intimate exploration of self and faith kept me engaged from the first page. Malarkey's thoughtful and visual descriptions of otherwise prosaic moments were enlivened and lasting. Following the protagonist, Ingrid, as she pushes through to another level in her life would have been a pleasure had the story remained in snowbound academia, but the reader is treated to the additional gift of the African island's stray cats, phosphorescent seas, and muzzein's call. That the story throws in hedonistic, post-colonial barlfies and a respectul, admiring look at Islam is further enriching. It is a romantic and cinematic novel that I highly recommend."
3,A Promising Author,"I am very glad to say that I read Miss Malarkey's second book before I ordered and read her first book. Resurrection, her second book, is inspiring and pulls you into its pages where you gladly get lost.After reading Resurrection, I was anxious to read An Obvious Enchantment.Although her ability as an author is ""obvious"", the book was slow and disconnected and her characters fell flat. All that being said, I look forward to her continued writing and hope she will expand her subject matter."
5,Super-Duper!,"Mandie's grandmother has bought the school that Mandie and Celia attend, and because Ms. Taft is installing electricity and furnaces, there are workers and holes everywhere.But all the holes are blessings in disguise. Mandie and Celia discover a tunnel under the schoolhouse. And that tunnel leads to a very surprising discovery.I liked this book right from the start. I especially liked the part when Mandie and Celia have a pillow fight and their bed collapses. That was funny!"
5,GREAT BOOK,I love reading the Mandie books.They are my favorit.If you have any kids read it to them.They will love all the mysteries.
1,Poor title choice,"I wonder how the author would feel about me writing a book about a Lilly Goodman as long as I disclosed that lilly Goodman is just a name I made up.I live near Candle, Alaska and this was the soul reason I purchased the book."
1,Expensive and Useless,"I bought this program for my daughter to use for assistance in her Algebra 1 and 2 classes in highschool. Not only is the program expensive, but it is very limited in what it can do. It does not come with a users guide, either, leaving you to use the hit and miss method of figuring out how to use it. She was in advanced classes and it was virtually useless for her. Eventually, the program stopped working, as well. I consistently get error messages when trying to load it. This is a real waste of money. I don't recommend it. If I could give it 0 stars, I would."
1,Algebrator there is lots of room for improvement.,Algebrator is a math help software I bought earlier this year to use for my college Algebra classes.It has way to many steps even when you set it to a minimum of steps. Plus it uses way to many fractions and dispite what the setting are.when dealing with radicals or numbers with any given power it will fill up the screen with steps with number with powers that are fractions and fractions with fractions its mind boggling. Its not a ideal Software for the math student. The only benefit has is that it will give you the correct answer below after scrolling thru several pages.
5,Works as advertised,"I bought an older version (2.1), but customer support was very helpful and upgraded for free to version 4.0, which has nice graphics and more features including matrix and log functions. You can solve or simplify step-by-step. Check the company website for the latest version."
5,Highly useful and a great bargain,"This book is highly useful, presenting 8 NT translations in a single glance. I hope to see a similar OT from them!"
2,More modern info online for free,"Save your dough, buy a different book or get your info somewhere else, online for free. Ancient."
1,Enough Books for the Weekend Refinisher!,"Aren't there enough finishing books written for the hobbyist? How about a book that shows the hobbyists how they can get professional looking finishes by using professional tools, techniques and materials? Books like this keep the hobbyist at hobbyist levels, never raising the stakes or the standards. The big fault is the publisher, Taunton Press because this publisher is not interested in focusing on the true craft of wood finishing.If other crafts were treated as immaturely as wood finishing, weekend woodworkers would build nothing more complicated than popsicle stick houses. Only the craft of wood finishing gets this bay treatment approach when it comes to publishing books."
1,More unrated Garbage....,"It;s the same old formula and the low budget is highly seen in this fourth entry (again it went staright to home video). I'm sure the Sci-Fi channel will show it at some point, but the effects will make you so sick, you will never want to watch horror/monster movies again."
4,IT'S GETTING TOO RISQUE,"Having viewed the, unrated, fourth installement of the Species movie series, I must give it a four star rating. In my opinion, it wasn't as interesting as the first film. And although I am a fan of this specific movie title, I just have one concern. Each successive film, after the initial one, proceeds to get more risque than its predecessor. I understand that some explaination has to be included about the sexual proclivities of these alien creatures. But, it appears that their exploits get bolder with each new venture. I thought that it was tastefully propounded and displayed in the first installment of the series. Perhaps, it was because I had an unrated copy. And, that was the reason for the blatant sexual displays. in closing, I'll still purchase this film series, anyway, because I want to find out if the screenwriters will allow the scientific community to destroy these creatures."
1,Terrible in every way,"While new star Helena Mattsson will most likely take your breath away, there is absolutely nothing else in ""Species: The Awakening"" to keep your interest for more than five minutes. As a big fan of the original Species and to a lesser degree its first sequel, it's painful to watch these straight to video sequels turn the series in to straight up sci-fi cheese. Every trace of intelligence the series once had has been flushed away with the past two ""films"". ""Species: The Awakening"" is simply a boring, poorly acted, poorly scripted piece of garbage with terrible ""rubber suit"" special effects and laughably bad dialog. Even beautiful women like the aforementioned Helena Mattson can no longer save this series from imploding on itself. Sil would be turning over in her grave....."
3,Sizes run small - Buy one size larger,"This the 4th pair of the same Dr Martens sandal I have purchased and this is the first time the same size I used to get is smaller now. I'm a size 11 in regular shoes and I used to buy 11 on this model an they used to fit like a glove...now that is no longer accurate and should have order one size up even when I read all the reviews (Should have listened) overall the quality (Of a brand new product) looks solid, We'll see what happens in a year!"
3,Size runs small,"Bought these for my husband who usually wears an 11 or 12. Had to exchange them twice and ended up with a 13 (the largest size the make) and they were still too small. Bummer, because this is the only style he likes."
1,Worst sandals!,"I bought two pair and both are falling apart in less than a year.I'm elderly and use them for casual use and soon after I bought them the rear strap vinyl which covers the leather started coming off, a few months later I was walking to the store and one sole dropped off.I own one more different style and the inner sole is crumbling after only a year.Dr Martens only covers them for one year for factory defects.Stay away from them!"
3,Very sad,"I read this book in two days, found myself drawn to turn each page and it was definitely a good read, but Ms. Ingram is very sad, despite occasional mentions of her mistakes, she seems to have no remorse. I think it would almost have been buyable as a true love outside age had she not gone and slept (one night stand yet) with another student and friend of the original lover ! Agggh. Keep her away from the kids!"
5,Not a Musicologist,"One of Mexico's most unique voices. There will never be another Cuco Sanchez. I just wish there were more songs on this CD. If you like Mexican Music from days gone by, this is a must."
1,Missing games,"I just got this item because it had Lord of the Rings, but when it got here, it was missing that game. If I would of known, I wouldn't have bothered with it"
5,The perfect gift for a new couple.,Bought one of these ornament sets when my older son got married and now have ordered another set for my other son's first Christmas together.The set is gorgeous and each ornament has special meaning. All is explained on the engravable certificate included with the set.Beautifully gift boxed for giving and storing these wonderful ornaments.
4,missing information,"The Bride's Tree ornament Collection is a beautiful gift.This gift was purchased for a brides shower gift.There is no description of the contents their meanings for each ornament.There is no way for the reciepient to know this is an old German tradition.Was the description inadvertently omitted?Doesn't say much for the gift being presented for the price paid.If this information is available, please send immediately via same account and address through Marshall Fields.respectfully,Patricia BenedictID:24341948Pkg ID: 00714880845Ship code: 492Wave page: 504Process Date: 09-25-2002"
3,Displeased with the way they were boxed and needs Card!!!!,I was very disappointed in the packaging of such a beautiful and expensive gift.What would it take to put a little more effort into making a MUCH nicer!!! eye-opener box. Also a card would really help letting the person who is recieving the gift to know about the tradition of the product.&#60;br /&#62;<br />Hope this will helps!!!
5,The Iron Men of Metz,"A gripping account of the lives of 22 members of the 95th Infantry Division from induction into the armed forces through their discharge, including an epilogue for each, bringing the reader up to date on their present lives. Descriptions of basic training and combat are accurate and exciting eye-witness accounts of the trials and tribulations of members of the ""greatest generation"". A well written book that is very hard to put down. Accounts are divided into the sequences in which they occurred. Historical perspectives inserted in appropriate places help the reader to understand the progress of World War II and its relationship to previous conflicts. Highly recommended to any student of military history and even to those who heretofore have had little interest in war stories."
5,"tempi problems at a minimum, great sound and interpretations","I will focus on the ten greatest quartets (#s 14-23) which I know best. However, the QI play the earlier quartets just as well. Occasionally the QI played too slowly for me, especially late in its career. But in the Mozart I found little of this problem, which allwos one to enjoy their beautiful sound (individually and collectively) and savor the depth -charged interpretations-sound was a factor but rarely an end in itself. Tempi here are usually played as written, not too slowly but not rushed (c.f their slowish Beethoven opus 18s and theirSchubert #15) There is not a weak interpretation here, an asset which parallels there Beethoven #s 7-16 and Schubert #s 12-14. The music itself is glorious and it is shameful that @s 20-23 are ( or were) less well known. I would renk them as follows in descending order: 15, 23, 22, 20, 21, 19, 17, 18, 14, 16.Peers: Emerson (especially #s 21-23-they did not do #20), Smetana, Amadeus"
2,Not a trivia book,This book is not what I was expecting. I bought it as a gift for someone who loves the film thinking they could learn lots and also quiz themself. It's really only for EXTREME fans who really need all media related to the film.
2,Motor not durable,"I didn't have many of the problems described in the negative reviews - the machine doesn't move too much, the reamer does its job, and the spout works fine. But I have two complaints: one minor and one major.The minor complaint: the reservoir is way too shallow. By the time you've got through two lemons, you have to empty it (and clean all the lemon innards off the reamer). This gets old if you're trying to make enough juice for a pitcher of lemonade, say.The major complaint: after a couple weeks of use, the motor sounds absolutely horrible and grindy. At first this only happened when the reamer turned counterclockwise, but now it's happening in both directions. It is very unpleasant to hear, and judging by its progression, I'd say the whole juicer isn't long for this world.I wouldn't buy this again, and plan to return it under warranty."
2,Poorly designed,"Everyone's said it already, this juicer is a serious fail. I don't own it, I used it at the house I'm renting a room from, and the counter was a mess! The spout is really short, and the juicer moves, no matter what you do. Don't get it."
2,Cuisinart should be ashamed,"First, I would like everyone to know I love the Cuisinart brand of products. I have replaced most of my old kitchen small appliances with Cuisinart products over the past ten years. However, Cuisinart should be ashamed to have their name on this product, the Cuisinart CCJ-100 Citrus Pro Juicer.The rubber ""feet"" on the product travel across the draining board when it is in use. It has a very low juice capacity and the juice needs to be emptied after approximately 1/2 of a grapefruit is squeezed. The pulp catcher qorks well, but is filled quickly and needs to be cleaned extremely often as you work. The pulp catcher is unwieldly and must be physically picked out by your fingersin lieu of just being able to rinse the pulp out of the machines pulp catcher.I will definitely opt for a more expensive juicer with a different brand name attached."
2,Disappointed,"My wife and I were disappointed by this product. Having owned other Cuisinart products in the past and being very satisfied with them, we expected this juicer to be the same. It turned out it's a failure.After using it for 3-4 times it started being very noisy when using it, and less effective in juicing. In other words, the engine got louder and weaker.Returned it couple of weeks after buying it."
1,The juicing cone plastic disintegrates in contact with citric acid,"This product is unsafe, the juicing cone and container are made of black plastic that disintegrates in contact with the acid in citruses after ~2 months of usage. You will notice white dust and small white specks of plastic peeling off. I presume plastic is not very safe for eating."
2,Messy!,Messy! It can overflow and the dispenser gets obstructed. You will need to clean the pulp often in order to keep juicing.
1,Hang the Designers!,"A product so bad the manufacturers must have known we would hate it before they ever put it on the shelves. I went back to my manual juicer after investing in this turd. Spills juice on the counter every time you use it, produces half the juice per fruit that I can make by hand, two-handed operation necessary and it's expensive. Mine's under the counter now, maybe someday I'll tear it apart for the motor. So much for your good name, Cuisinart. You knew you were ripping off your customers when you decided to sell this thing, now you never get to peddle me another appliance for as long as I live. Shortsighted of you? Who knows? I'm no marketing scumbag hired to post fake favorable reviews on this site; just another customer dumb enough to believe your brand name still meant quality. Live and Learn. Buyers beware."
3,Citrus Juicer,Great Value. Wish it had more juice storage and retractable cord really is not retractable or stowable. High-speed centrifuge effect is great to extract more juice. Super easy to clean.
1,Looks 10 Juicer 2,"Loved the way this looked but its look leads to it's poor functionality. It is weighted all wrong and when you are juicing a grapefruit or a large orange, the device starts to spin, out of resistance. The other day the plastic shaft wore down and now it makes a grinding noise, so, after three weeks I have removed the CCJ-100 Citrus Pro Jucier from my kitchen counter and it currently resides in my garage, a reminder that form should follow function."
1,Awkward and annoying,"I bought this on a day when I needed a juicer and this was the only one at my local store. I agree with many of you--the juice goes everywhere but in the cup. The thing jumps and jerks around, and with the tolerance b/w the juicer and cup so close, you just get a mess and a lot of wasted juice on the counter, making it slippery and ever more likely to slide.The device walks all over even though I use a silicon hot pad to give it more to hold on to. Despite its flaws, I've actually used it a lot, alternately laughing and swearing at what a poor design it is. The killer is that now the speed up function, whereby the residual juice is spun out of the accumulated pulp at high speed when you put the special cover on, is no longer working. It's even hard to clean! Pulp hangs in crevices and grooves. It's an astoundingly poor design and not very durable either. It's simply a piece of junk, sorry folks. I'm stepping up to the Waring."
1,The Absolute Worst!,"The other reviews have hit it all, although my juicer hasn't stopped running yet. Spins on the counter, clogs after one orange, and the high speed spin feature is a joke spinning seeds and debris into the juice. I was replacing an ancient Oster that was getting a little weak due to age, but I'm going back to it..."
1,Do Not Buy This Juicer,"I cannot believe how poorly this one is designed.The juicer moves around the counter, and makes quite a mess.The spout is way too short, and barely reaches beyond the lip of a typical measuring cup. It is not very powerful, and takes almost as much time to juice an orange as one could do by hand.I already have the Cuisiart attachment to juice, and will go back to it, despite the space the parts take up in my kitchen"
1,Don't buy!,Do not buy this juicer unless you like cursing. It is horrible. It turns and juice goes everywhere except in the cup. I am now on my mission for a good juicer....
1,Piece of. ...,"I bought this juicer approximately a year ago to juice my tangerines. It's dead. All it does is make a whrrrr, whrrr, whrrrrr sound, and it won't turn. I guess it didn't feel like working anymore. Now, I'm back looking for another. How could something that I thought was a good brand turn out such a poor piece of equipment?"
1,Bad,"After 5 months it doesn't work anymore. You have to put it in the garbage. This is the second one I buy. I love Cusinart product, but this one it is really bad."
5,YUMMY!,"LOVE IT! I am a juice-a-holic now with this juicer. My favorite is freshly squeezed lemonade and next favorite is a good breakfast juice. I can make juice in under a minute and it is incredibly easy to clean up, and no pulp gets stuck at the bottom like it did with my old rusty juicer. Barely had to read the manual, everything was so easy, very happy!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Do not waste your money on this lemon!,"I've been juicing oranges and tangerines for years and this piece of junk is the worst!! You've got to constantly unclog the little flow bin, the spinner gets all gunked up, the machine gets messy constantly. I don' think the idiot designers realized that oranges have pulp! I blew 24 bucks on this piece of crap at Sears, and now I can't get my dough back."
4,your moneys worth,"We bought this inexpensive juicer to replace another and aging inexpensive juicer. We liked the price and conforming color scheme, as well as the reasonably elegant design (compared to our old one). It arrived on time and has proven good so far. The motor is smooth with very low noise (compared to our old one). We like having the spout as opposed to an integrated catchment bowl. It makes disassembly and cleaning much simpler. We noted that some have complained about the spout being too short. It could benefit from a little more length but this has not been a show stopper for us, as a variety of beakers and jars serve quite well to catch the juice. For the money, this has been a good deal."
2,Its ok,"This juicer gets the juice out and leaves very little behind and I love the cap that goes on top. When you have finished extracting your juice put the cap on and it pulls the remaining juice left in the catcher cup out and into the glass. The big down side to this juicer is that the juice pours out of a spout into a glass. Many many times because of the power of the machine it moves or the glass moves and your busy holding the fruit and the machine so before you can put everything down and move the cup back in place a large portion of the juice has run onto the counter. I recently bought a new juicer that dispenses the juice directly into a bowl beneath it, a much better idea."
1,Piece of junk - don't buy,"This is the worst piece of crap I have ever seen. The juicer is virtually worthless. It's unstable, you can't hold on to it anywhere while juicing, the pour spout is so short you can't get a glass under it so you end up spilling liquid all over the counter, and on and on. Don't buy, in fact boycott!"
2,not worth buying,Not worth buying.Although the juicer is nicely designed it is weak and unstable because of its shape.Fruit pulp does not allow the juice to come through well.
1,amazingly bad,"In my many decades as a consumer, I have never dealt with an appliance that was more badly designed. The body of the juicer spun to the left or the right; the juice ran on the counter as a result. The spout was too short. The gears stripped repeatedly. The cap for squeezing without using one's hands did not work. The unit had to be cleaned after every small glass of juice -- and was impossible to clean thoroughly. The machine was very noisy. The ribs in the plastic reamer quickly wore out. The only pleasure I had from the machine was in throwing it out."
4,So happy with this juicer!,"This is my first juicer. I was so excited after using it the first time! I juiced 9 lemons in just a few minutes and got 2 cups of juice! I followed the instructions and it was so easy! The reverse juice function is ingenious and the Fast Spin function works well too. I will say the juicer did ""dance"" around a bit thus the reason for 4 stars instead of five. I used one hand on the base and one hand on the lemon. It worked beautifully! A fantastic value for the price."
4,Simple Powerful Citrus Juicer,"Would've been a five if also included a small cone, but it works even with the standard cone. It is a powerful juicer, simplest cleanup, does the job and does not take up a large space. ""Walking"" is not an issue when on a non slide surface, anticipating the reverse motion with hand placement. Was wary to purchase this juicer after reading reviews here but did so because it was inexpensive and would definitely purchase again!"
1,Piece of Crap!,"Having had good luck with a Cuisinart coffee maker and food processor I had held their products in high regard. Based on this prior experience, I subsequently purchases a Cuisinart coffee grinder and citrus juicer. They both just plain stopped working shortly after I began using them, probably because of a poor quality motor. Like some women I have known, they are attractive but without substance and should be avoided."
1,I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT AFTER I RETURNED IT!!!!,It spins on the counter and the juice always slips out of the cup! DO NOT buy this piece of junk!!!!! don't waste your money on this.
2,sorry i purchased,"cheaply made, purchased the juicer because of brand name expected more from cuisnart,placiing fruit and holding fruit not to good"
2,Waste of money and time,"If you're planning to used it everyday, forget it. This juicer lacks of power, firmness, and it's noisy.Spend more money and you'll have a better product"
1,Terrible,"I'm a proud owner of a few cuisinart appliances. Unfortunately, their citrus Juicer falls short of cuisinart quality. Be ware, when juicing, the juicer has a tendency to spin causing a big mess. you have to use two hands to use this juicer, one on the fruit and the other to anchor the machine down so it doesn't go into a tailspin. not a good buy!! over priced and poor quality--no stars for this 1."
3,No so good,"It looks like a not very good appliance to me: not powerfull enough; moves on a countertop when it works; the output nozzle is too short. On a bright side, it looks very nice and takes little of the countertop space."
1,Bad product from a good company,"This juicer is not worth the money. It is not stable, and the juice spills all over because one cannot keep a glass aligned with the spout. Cuisinart makes great products, but this is a failure."
2,Good Ideas but needs improvement....,"The auto reverse, tilt lip and centrifugal spin are excellent ideas,but the motor isn't strong enough. We went through this brandjuicer after 10 days of juicing three times. (3 juicers) They workgreat in the beginning, but the motor gives quickly.Also, the units move around on the counter and the lipisn't long enough.We do the master cleanse which you need to juice 12 to 16 lemons orlimes a day for 10-40 days. Most all juicers are 'toys' whenit comes to juicing this amount.Cuisinart, make your motor stronger, the lip longer andbetter rubber feet and you have yourself a winner!It would be worth the extra cost!"
1,Awful! Avoid this product at all costs!,"Cuisinart is well known for their quality kitchen appliances, but they failed on this one. It doesn't do a good job extracting the juice out of the lemons (or whatever), its ""reversing"" turner is acutally quite annoying and causes the appliance to move all of the counter. The spout is not long enough and drips juice down the side of the machine. Further, it does an extermely poor job of filering out the seeds and pulp. I think that there are much better models out there and I think a hand reamer and common strainer do a MUCH better job."
2,You can do better...,"This will closely mimic at least one other review, so I'll just put the pros and cons out there.pro:Despite many problems, it gets the juice out of the orange. So much for the pros.cons:Impossible to keep it from turning under you and making a big mess.Tray fills up with pulp after three oranges and requires cleaning.Spout is ridiculously short, leading to a big mess.Reverse mechanism is just weird and unpredictable - when it works at all.The motor makes a horrible noise about half the time. Cuisinart actually sent us a new one because of this... the new one makes the noise a little bit less often."
1,F-minus!,"The first juicing season we had this it worked well, aside from the short spout and juice all over the counter quirks. We got used to those idiosycrasies and worked around them, mostly because the auto-reverse speed spin feature was a unique feature that worked well and produced more juice than we thought possible. Then, for the second juicing season (and now the third), the auto-reverse spin feature inexplicably has FAILED. Never been compelled to offer up a review before, but had to chip in my opinion on this P-O-S (and it looks like I'm not alone!). It's just not worth the trouble..."
3,Citrus Pro Juicer - burn out,"I've had 2 of these juicers. Obviously I liked it's juicing capabilities, but I burned or stripped both of them out in less than a year each. I agree with some of the other reviewer's about the directional reversal, it can be messy when it jerks and the spout is no longer lined up with the container the juice is flowing into. I reconciled that dilemma by keeping the spout in the up position, then lowering it over the container when the machine wasn't running. I won't buy another one."
5,Citrus Juicer,Works like a breeze! I can juice 18 oranges in about 5 minutes. Soooo easy to use. Recommend highly.
1,They got this one WRONG,"I totally agree with the reviews posted. I had a Braun juicer which does not seem to be made any more. It was simple to use and lasted about a decade. This machine is everything that the previous reviews say: Unstable, messy and frustrating to use. Don't buy it."
1,Weak and poorly designed,"The juicer is not powerful enough. Trying to juice an orange causes the juicer to shriek and then stop cold. I can't get half of the juice out. Then the reservoir for juice is very small and overflows the container. In addition, to get enough juice for one glass of juice, I have to clean the juicer half-way through, because it gets clogged with pulp. Buying this was a huge mistake."
1,We are returning this poorly designed juicer,"I was very disappointed when I first used this juicer. It does not stay in place so juice gets everywhere. Then the spout does not reach out far enough so again, juice everywhere. When you are done most of the juice ends up on the counter. We will be returning this poorly made juicer."
2,Not up to Cuisinart Standards,Poorly designed item. Plastic driveshaft subject to breaking. The first one I bought came home broken. Clogs quickly with pulp. Have to remove strainer to clean. This increases the mess. Genius who designed spout made it too short - juice will dribble down the front. This thing will cause a mess regardless of how carefull you are. Avoid it and buy something else.
1,A disappointment,I thought I was safe buying Cuisinart after my old faithful Braun juicer died. The base is sooo light that the whole thing turns while you squeeze the fruit and juice spills all over. PLEASE! Who designed such a lemon!!
1,Terrible,"I just got this juicer over the other brands thinking Cuisinart was a good one... what a mistake! A soon as you put your citrus down it starts moving all over the counter and half of the juice will end on the counter instead of the glass..... When it start spinning the other direction does an horrible noise, like if the all machine was going to fell apart!"
1,Avoid this juicer!,"I sure wish I read the reviews before buying and using this product... This is one of the worst name-brand consumer products I have ever purchased. Not dangerous, but it is clear that Cuisinart put it on the market because it looks good; no one ever actually tested it in use! It rotates in place frequently as it is used, spinning juice all over the kitchen and counter. Even if the designer had somehow overcome the gripping problem with suction cup feet, the strainer AND the spout easily and quickly clog which means you have the rinse 2 or 3 parts every other orange. Disaster."
1,Not the juicer to buy,We had the older model for 5 years and it worked ok but it looked very bad. This new unit stopped working after 2 months. We could not push down on the orange without stopping the motor. It is sad to see the quality of a product get worse with time.
1,Zero Stars - Cuisinart Should Recall Juicer,"This juicer is an embarrasment to Cuisinart. I purchased this to juice limes and lemons and when juicing them:1) the top swivels and the lime moves all over the place so you have to use it without the plastic top to try to get some results2) the unit is noisy and the engine sounds like it's dying3) the base moves when you are juicing so that the juice goes all over the counter instead of in the cup4) etc.....I can't wait to take it back to the store and if the store weren't closed, I would take it back now and it's almost midnight. What a horrible product and an embarrasment to Cuisinart. They should recall this juicer to save their name."
1,Cuisinart Citrus Juicer Not User Friendly!,"This Cuisinart Citrus Juicer CCJ100 was a gift. After much research of citrus juicers I determined this was the best one to have so I put in my request. After removing it from the packaging and assembling it, which was very easy, I tested it with an orange, much to my disappointment!The juicer is not stable, by any means, and proceeded to twirl around the counter as I pushed down on the orange half. I repositioned it only to have the same thing happen again and again and again. By the time I had finished juicing one orange I had more juice on the counter top than in the glass!Clean up should be a snap, yet, after the pieces were soaked in hot soapy water for a few minutes, rinsed and dried, they had pulp stuck to them.Overall, for the cost, I'd say this juicer was a total disappointment to me and I'd have gotten similar or better results using an old fashioned hand juicer!"
1,PRODUCT NOT USER FRIENDLY,"I OWNED THIS JUICER, BUT GOT TIRED OF THE INEFFICIENT WAY IT HAS TO BE CLEANED.THE JUICER OPERATED OK, BUT CLEANING AFTER USE WAS A PAIN. SO, EVEN THOUGHTHE PRODUCT OPERATED EFFECTIVELY, IT GOT THE JUICE FROM ORANGES JUST FINE,BUTTHE OTHER LIMITATIONS WERE NOT WORTH IT. ALSO, MY CUISNART 'WALKED' WHEN HAD TOJUICING. I HAD TO PLACE THE MACHINE ON A MOUSE PAD TO PREVENT THIS.BOTTOM LINE > DON'T BUY THIS JUICER."
5,If you're buying a Juice Maker this the one you should buy,"I got this and this is great. it is very easy to handle and dose the job very nicely. I can grantee you, you will love it."
1,Pathetic,"First you plug it in the cord is so short you must hug the wall. When applying pressure to the juicer the footing slips, thus juice missing the glass. I first tried to juice into a 4 cup pyrex but since I only had a 1/8 inch clearance the juice fell everywhere but into the 4 cup. It clogs after juicing about four oranges. Clean up was also a battle. Cusinart went to great length to make this product as cheap as possible. Made in chine crap."
1,Avoid this juicer,"Every time i use it i get juice all over the counter, because the torque causes the machine to rotate, and the rubber feet won't hold it on the counter. I need to use one hand to hold the machine, another to hold the orange, yet the tiny spout makes it hard to align the glass with the juicer. This is the worst juicer i have ever used and regret buying it. Seems like the folks at Cuisinart cut too many corners on this one."
1,poor juicer,"I get the feeling that some manufacturers don't even try their products out. This juicer is slow, the clutch slips frequently, the auto stop feature is annoying, the rotation direction reversal feature is really annoying, there is no way to get the juice held in the pulp, etc., etc., etc. You want to pass on this one."
1,Worst Orange Juicer Ever? Quite Possibly,"This product is bad enough that I am posting a review on an appliance for the first time. It is really is as bad as everyone else has mentioned. Do yourself a favor and go for the Black & Decker or the CitriStar models. This is worst product I've ever bought, it fails at something so simple."
3,Nice bag but slips off my shoulder often.,"This is a great bag for the many compartments, it is so light (until you pile your stuff into it), easy to access through double zippers and durable material. What is not good for me is it slips off my shoulder constantly. I tried sewing the strap to the bottom to change the angle and that did not work either. Maybe I have slopy shoulders, I don't see other people complaining about this. I wanted a bag that would stay on my shoulder while I carry other bags, like when traveling on a plane. This one is not efficient that way. Anyone know of a similar bag that stays on?"
2,It is advertised as taupe color and actually is more of a olive green,"The back pack is always a great design, I have several-the color was not anything near taupe it was more of an olive green that is why I returned it. Thank You"
5,My mother just loves it!,"I bought this bag for my mother, who just loves Purple. She had one like this, but I didn't know if this would suit as well as that one did. It definitely did. I got so many thank yous . . ."
5,Perfect bag,"This bag is ideal, it has many pockets, is amazingly roomy, and best of all, it is comfortable to carry. Couldn't be better."
2,Time to regroup and reminisce,"I have been a long-time OMEN fan, and I love all their albums up until the BEST OF (Teeth of the Hydra). This album sounded to me like an attempt to come back before they were ready, and with a terrible vocalist to boot.If you are new to OMEN, I suggest the first three albums (Battle Cry, Warning of Danger, and The Curse), or the BEST OF if you can only choose one. The BEST OF album is a pretty good example of the styles from each early album, containing some of their best songs (but not ALL the best ones).I have not yet heard the newest album, but it sounds like it might be a decent return to form, based on reviews. I think it will be quite tough to replace J.D. Kimball on vocals, though."
5,Classic Jazz Recreations,"Here are 22 numbers which were first recorded a lifetime ago by groups as diverse as The Missourians, The California Ramblers, and King Oliver, to name but three at random. They have been lovingly recreated from the original recordings in performances that are the musical equals of the originals, but with the clarity of sound that we now take for granted. Being able to hear these historic scores in such fidelity must be as close as it gets to having been present in the studio the first time around."
3,Fabric Pots,The product picture is deceiving. The black pots have seams that are sewn with white thread and it's the first thing you see. You have to turn the fabric inside out and the roll the top down on the inside of the pot to hide the seams. A bit clumsy when adding soil. Would be a lot easier if they had used black thread.
2,Rust spot after a few years,The hot water start tasting like metallic one day. We open it up an there are a few rust spots. I'm quite disappoint with this Made In Japan product that I paid over $100 for it. I'm now a new owner of Chinese brand hot water pot that has stainless steel interior. I hope it last longer than this one.
2,Only lasted a couple of years.,"I used this regularly for tea and french-pressed coffee. Unfortunately after about 2 years, I went to descale it and found that the teflon lining sloughed off! It is useless now. Why do they have to coat the tank with non-stick? There is some debate as to whether that stuff is even hazardous to your health."
2,Interior coating coming off,"After two years' of continuous use, interior coating is coming off. A few rusty spots have developed in the past 6 months. The company's website does not provide a replace container. I liked the Zojirushi brand but this one seems a disappointment."
5,"Great for disabled people, too.","I got this for my mother who has arthritis and was having trouble lifting a coffee pot. With the one-touch electronic button, that problem's solved. To refill the pot, she doesn't have to lift anything -- just uses the sink's sprayer hose. No cleaning necessary with the descaler and dechlorinator. Being able to control the water temperature is also helpful. She keeps a folded hand towel close by so that just in case she should spill, no hot water would reach the floor.The photo on this page shows the pot kind of a creamy color, but I was glad to see that the pot's actually a soft white. The pot's really expensive, but I'm glad I got it for her.I think this would also be great for people like myself who drink hot water instead of tea or coffee."
5,Zojirushi CD-LCC30 Micom 3.0-Liter Electric Dispensing Pot,"Product as expected. It performs all the necessary function to make my hot tea in the morning at the office, avoid me to make multiple trip downstair to the microwave."
2,"6 years later, rusty spots on the bottom.",Bought mine 6 years ago. Only used it during the winter time each year (Nov - March).Until recently I was happy with this fancy hot water pot. But now it starts to have rusty spots on the bottom and it's out of the 5 year warranty period. It's a huge disappointment. I liked the Zojirushi brand but found this quality below my expectation for a $100+ appliance.
2,Not for fans of black tea,"This is actually an inconvenient item, which is the exact opposite I was looking for. This is probably a great item for people who drink herbal tea. It keeps water hot. I haven't tested the temperature but am guessing it is accurate. The problem is, if you drink black tea, you really want the water to be actual boiling temperature. You can press 'boil' but this is problematic. Even though the water is kept at a high temperature, it takes MUCH LONGER to completely boil than if you started from cold water in a regular electric pot. So you spend a lot of time standing there waiting for water to boil. Also, it doesn't have any audio indicator that the water has boiled, so if you walk away, chances are it will reach boiling while you're away, and then drop back down to 205 degrees by the time you are back. I find drinking black tea brewed at the lower temperature makes the tea taste strange. This item was a big let down due to the time consuming aspect."
1,Excellent product,"This is an excellent machine which boils water and keeps it at a high temperature. However, like anything else, once you pour water into a cup, it cools in five minutes. I also bought small a Bunn canister hot plate, not a mug warmer, which keeps the coffee or tea at a really hot temperature. In fact, one could get by with a small microwave, in the office, then the Bunn hot plate. The Zojibushi is good if multiple people are needing a quick hot water supply."
5,Reliable and Durable. Just make sure it's the one Made in Japan,"I bought my Zojirushi hot water pot 5 years ago and it still works like a charm. Not once did it stopped pumping water or did not heat the water to my preferred temperature.I'm a tea and coffee drinker so this little pot is my reliable partner for those times when I need to make a cup of tea or a bowl of soup. I remember when I was a child, my parents owned an ""air pot"" and a rice cooker of the same brand (both made in Japan) and it worked until I was a senior in high school. Therefore, it influenced me to only purchase items of the same brand that is made in Japan.Of course, times change and some of these appliances are now manufactured in China. Still, the quality of the Japanese-made version is durable and high quality, which I why I urge potential buyers to make sure that the Zojirushi hot water dispenser they buy is MADE IN JAPAN.My hot water pot is in its 6th year and it's still boils and dispenses my hot water without a problem."
2,Not very good...,"Failed in just 6 months. Very disappointed. This is my second one, the first failed in the same amount of time, I Just assumed it was bad.Shell out for the OEM stuff here, you'll end up on the side of the road otherwise."
5,Miro is Le Funkyman!,"This artist first caught my attention by his posters on a street corner in Montreal. I tracked down this record in Quebec City. Well worth the effort. From the openning cut, it doesn't stop. Let me first admit that I don't understand french. But that does not prevent me from enjoying this disc. There is never a dull moment. So many elements have been added on in a natural setting, that repeated listenings continue to offer enjoyment. It's funky like the cacophony of a hip downtown scene."
2,Not his best,"Buddy Greco is one of my guilty pleasures. His style is admittedly not one in tune with the times, but noone can really sell a certain type of song like he can. That said, this album saddened me. I'm afraid he's lost his pipes to a large extent by the time he made this--his range is not there. This isn't a minor complaint--he can't sustain much, or play around with his voice like he used to. He still has the phrasing, and very good small-group accompaniment, but the tracks depress me compared to his earlier work. Wish I could find some more of the older recordings (his ""16 Best"" is excellent!)."
5,Awesome CD,"Afroman is simply HALERIOUS and has awesome beats. I absolutely love the song ""Colt 45."" Me and my friends are constantly listening to it. It always puts me in a better mood after listening...It's a great cd."
4,Afroholic ---Sayed even better times.........,"* You tired of the Rest of the Guys...... Click over to where u find the best action? If it makes sense, Throw this album into your Shopping.I mean you will be glad u got it.."
4,"I normally don't like this type of ""hiphop""","Ok this is far from your ""normal"" hiphop, but afroman does take serious subjects but he makes them funny. That's nice for a change. I just heard the cd and it makes you laugh. But there are songs with a messages on it like ""Suck a dick jockey"". At first I thought don;t mind lyrics when this guy comes into play, but i changed my view. I LIKE AFROMAN and i say that now without shame!!So i would say listen to this cd even if you're a underground fan like me!!AND FOR PEOPLE WHO FIND THEMSELFS TO UNDERGROUND TO LISTEN TO THIS!! THE JOKES ON YOU!!"
5,afrocredible!!!,This C.D. is dope!! If you liked good times then you need to pick up this double dick set. trust me it is well worth it.
1,his first was best,everybody who has his first album or heard it they will be dissapointed with afroholic i sure was i really dont like any songs on it. and now i kinda wish i didn't buy it but if u must have it you must and i mean must listen to it first unlike me i hope his third album will be more like his first unlike this junk. cheaper on bestbuy and free shipping so get it there
4,AMAZING KID,yo dis cd is the man kna im sayin? 2 disc like close to 40 songs god damn son that shiz is hot and cant be stop aight so cop this disc and y'all all be happy aight im outone love
5,As rare a find as that special inkstand,"Badders' book is a pure delight for the collector of inkstands and ink bottles. It has 502 colored plates which will have the collector/reader drooling and upon discovering a match for one in his collection feeling that superb sense of satisfaction only a true inkwell lover can understand.Badders has included inkwells of many varied compositions, and unlike the very few other books on the subject, has included the range of value of each item."
3,The Collectors Guide to Inkwells,I felt that this book had many inkwells to explore but I would have liked to see the information of the markings showing where they were made to help identify the inkwells.
2,NOT INFORMATIVE ENOUGH.,"THE BOOK DOES NOT HELP COLLECTORS OF CZECH BOHEMIAN IRIDESCENT INKWELLS. FIRST, THERE ARE ONLY 8 EXAMPLES IN THE BOOK. THE PHOTOGRAPHS ARE TOO DARK AND DO NOT CAPTURE THE BEAUTY OR TEXTURE OF THE GLASS. BUT WORSE, THE INFORMATION IS WRONG. INKWELLS CLEARLY MARKED WITH THE GERMAN PATENT MARK, D.R.G.M. ARE LABELED 'AMERICAN."" IN ONE INSTANCE, TWO INKWELLS MADE OF THE SAME GLASS ARE CALLED RESPECTIVELY 'AMERICAN"" AND ""EUROPEAN."" THE AUSTRIAN MARK OE.P COMES OUT ""DEP."" AT LEAST THEY ARE CALLED ""LOETZ-TYPE,"" WHICH IS ACCURATE, SINCE NONE OF WAS MADE BY LOETZ. A GOOD BARGAIN BOOK TO LOOK AT PICTURES, BUT DEFINITELY NOT FOR THE ESPECIALIST."
4,An Amazing SACD,As with J.S. Bach's Cantatas Massaki Suzuki brings his great skill and love for this music. Many of the best momemnts from thecomplete performance are included on this very well packed SACDAt 81:18 it is one of the longest CD's on the market. If you are looking for a highlights CD of the St. Matthew Passion you need look no further than this SACD.
4,"the great king kung fu, so bad that it is good, then so much more bad that it is not good anymore, then stilghly worse than that","if you love ""so bad it is good"" movies, chances are, you already own this. but if you are like me and enjoy them only occasionally, then you should still get this movie. some scenes with the three non-ape main characters are boring, but, that is the only reason it lost a star. the side characters are all so stupid that they are great. they were trying for the purposely campy humor, but became so mush more stupid then that that is it's own level of awful humor. the best feature, is the police chief, an obvious caricature of John Wayne. lot's of fun as long as you can sit through the boring scenes with the three main characters, because they actually have a few good jokes that you don't want to miss between their boring boring boring dialogue.also, if you are a fan of the old David Carradine kung fu tv show, then you will enjoy the spoofs on that."
2,It was college,"We discovered this movie braving a harsh winter in DeKalb, Il at NIU. It was just soooo stupid we laughed so hard. The writing, concept, and acting were so bad it was funny. It now has a place in our hearts....The saddest part is all the people we watched it with still laught about it. We even have one quote from the movie that we recite once in a blue moon.""I'm dressed. I have a hat (hearty chuckle)""-King Kung Fu."
5,EPIC,"How many films can righteously claim the adjective ""phantasmagorical"" in respect to it's inexplainably preposterous, outlandish, fanciful, freakishly dead-on out-and-out totality of grinding to the earth of all that is coveted within the all-encompassing cinematic recipe book? Only one, and this does it whole hog. Why even deign to make another movie? What possible use is any other reel of celluloid after this gem stormed the theaters in the mid 70s? None, I say! None!Bravo, beloved monkey! Bravo! Bravo!"
3,fun kung fu romp...,This flick which was made back in the 1970's is a fun romp. It's a low budget movie with alot of humour as the lead character is a kung fu expert and a ape! The dvd looks pretty good too which is a plus. I too saw this movie in wichita ks at the theater. I wonder if the one star reviewer was in the same theater with me? Anyways this is silly fun and is still a enjoyable film to watch. It's not a serious movie though and it succeeds at it's goal really of being a family friendly comedy. And it was a huge hit in Asia at the time. It was sucessful enough to get released to the theatres in the u.s. too so that's good enough for me. If you don't like silly movies made on a low budget about kung fu fighting apes then this one may not be for you!! But I still find this one to be alot of fun.
2,"Okay story, poor quality","While the story, about Song Jiang, one of the 36 main heroes of the Chinese classic ""Water Margins"" (aka Band of Brothers), is okay and the acting by Loletta Lee and Wu Ma passable, the video and audio quality of this DVD-R is poor. Also because it's DVD-R, it may not play well on some stand-alone DVD players. Unless you're a Loletta fan, this is a pass."
4,beautiful little plants,"I was really surprised and pleased when these 8 little plants arrived. They were packaged so well! They are a cool weather plant - -Alpine, but I keep them in partial shade. I am in Southern California. They come back each year. They are slow growers. So the pot can be small for a couple years. I have had mine 2 years now. The colors are mixed so you do not know what color you will get, but they are all very nice."
5,Great Gloves,"I bought these gloves for my high school son. He wanted a glove that would still allow for some dexterity. He rides his bike daily to school, around town and on paper route. He has worn these gloves daily since they arrived. They are sufficient for most days in Northern Ohio and are thin and fitted enough to wear as a liner under another pair of warmer gloves for the coldest days(low teens and below). They seem to be wearing well."
4,Not for Fruit Jars,"Good, but not for fruit jars. I should have done more research. Seems that the 'Red Book' would have been a a better way to go for getting prices on Mason (and similar) fruit jars. Otherwise, this book is very well done."
5,Most Satisfying,"Sam Silva is a warm, caring and intelligent man that I have the pleasure to know. This book reflects his intense passion and boundless creativity. Sam expresses himself in a raw and honest way that is rare and I always look forward to visiting him as well as reading his poetry. I highly recommend this latest book, Eating and Drinking as a unique and memorable read. Sam is able to use language in ways that truly provokes an emotional response from the reader. Whether he is writing about love, war, feast or famine, the reader cannot help but get caught up in the intensity of the subject. I find my heartbeat speed up whenever I read Sam Silva's poetry . His writing is simply beautiful!!!"
1,Sycophants for Silva,"Reading the previous reviews I could only give one title to mine.A more objective reviewer, and not myself, once said about Silva: ""If you were allowed to babble all day and wrote it all down, you're bound to come up with a line or two that someone else might want to read.""Silva's writing is at best amusing, but should best be approached as the musings of a delusional mind. His mental problems are better described by other reviewers who know him better, but they seem put aside the irate, paranoid and self-destructive elements in his often bleak writings. That said, the previous reviews reflect Silva's svengali-like influence over his accolytes, but this says more about his personality than the quality of his writings."
5,ALL YOU NEED IS THIS ONE,"Rarely, when you look to the international music ground you come across such a masterpiece. It has every emotion in it and it has been sung amazingly. Orchestration is breathtaking and Mina's voice is unique and moving like no other. You must have it if you love music, if you love to laugh, if you love to cry. Unforgettable and worth every penny. All you need is here.PS: it contains 3 separete cds"
5,Best rice cooker I have owned so far,"I had high expectations for this product because of the reviews and I was not disappointed. Perfect rice, no boiling over and no burnt rice at the bottom of the pan. I do wish that the top would come off to ease cleaning but that is not a big issue."
3,Holley 0-80670 Street Avenger 670 CFM Square Bore 4-Barrel Vacuum Secondary Electric Choke Carburetor,Looked good and worked good...Wish i had gotten a spread bore carb instead...Oh well it is what it is...go figure.
4,Cheating isn't easy!,"I have read many of R.L Stines books and this one is one of his best yet. It puts the thought in your head wether you want to cheat on a major test or not. It made me think twice! The characters seem very realistic once you get into the first couple of chapters. This book makes you think what will Adam do to Carter next. First the cow heart, money, what will be next. ""The Cheater"" can really boggle your mind in a way. It leaves you thinking was the cow heart really from adam? Did Carter kill Adam? In my opinion this is a must read book because R.L Stine makes it seem like you are really part of the story. If you are into suspense then this is the book for you."
5,No Way Out,Carter Phillips is under a lot of pressure. She needs to get a 700 in order to get into Princeton. Someone overhears her plea for help and agrees to take the test for her in exchange for a date. Carter agrees and she does get a 700. But Adam wants more. Much more. He blackmails Carter.
4,interesting...,"This book was different, it had like a stalker plot to it. the guy who stalks the girl sort of thing. It follows the R.L. stine fear street thing, her living on fear street and bad things happening so yea the book was pretty good."
4,Very suspenseful!,"I didn't expect this story to be very good, but it turned out to be great! The writing kept you on the edge of your seat."
5,Wisdom is What You Will Receive,"""The Wisdom of Trees"" is one of the most fasinating books I'veread yet. First off, I love trees and have books identifing them,etc, but this book goes beyond genius and familia. It talks about the ancient people from all over who worshiped what trees, what Gods or Goddess were watched over that tree. Also someintriguing information from where legends of witches and suchstarted. I talk about this book to whoever will listen..LOLI highly recommend it to anyone interested in medicinal herbs,ancient practices...Celts, Norse, Greek, Egyptian..., planets, gems, history...I could go on and on."
5,One of the BEST ! ! !,"I've been selling off books from our library for five or six years now, you know, downsizing. This book is one of the ones that will never be sold. It is the perfect balance of hard science and emperical knowledge from our collective past. Its a serious read, at times some might find it a little dry, but its the science, myth, and history of trees. They have kept us alive on this planet for a very long time. This is written from the perspective of an herbalist."
3,My first Gnome,"I love cute yard decor and have been searching for a larger Gnome. This Gnome lights up by the means of batteries which normally I would stay away from but other reviewers were saying how much brighter it was than something solar so I got it.It is cute, but if I had seen it in person verses just on the web I wouldn't have purchased it at this 30+ price. I expected it to be much brighter running on batteries however they do seem to last a long time. But I would have to strongly disagree that it is brighter than solar items. In fact I have solar items that ARE brighter than this Gnome.I would have gladly paid more like 15 dollars for this item, but I wouldn't recommend it at this price with the added price of batteries as well."
2,Heritage Farms Gnome with Garden Light,This is a larger size gnome but plastic and more cheaply made. The redeeming quality is that is has lots of color. You have to use C-cell batteries for the light. It is so light that I keep knocking it over when I water in the garden.
1,What a mess,I did not have success with the Moss. Worked and worked with it but never formed to my container so I ended up just putting it in a moss liner. As soon as it dried back out it started dropping off the container every time I watered it. Probably user error but this user will not be buying again.
3,Was NOT an 'exact fit' for my vehicle,"The wires work okay, and they seem to be good quality. However, they were not an 'exact fit' for my car, as was stated. The lengths of the individual wires were not the same as the original equipment. In general, they were 2 to 3 inches longer for each of the 6 lengths used. I have bought spark plug wires at other places that really were 'exact fit', and were the exact same length as the original equipment."
3,Meh,"Two years since the last review on TR3060.Unless BattleTech introduces an entirely new facet to the game, the TR series will have to die out - there are only so many combinations of weapons and equipment available. There are a lot of ""new"" designs in the book, but any fan should notice that most are enhanced versions of earlier designs. The book's strength is in the fiction accompanying each design. The art is NOT that good, I wish it looked more like 3025 and 3058. Mind you, some of the designs do look good; most look God-Awful Stupid (TM)."
4,3060 Review,"As a long time Battletech player, I'm quick with the purchase of any new tech readout. This one was no exception. The new mechs have strength, especially some of the new IIC models (Just Look at the Guilotine IIC)On the other hand, much has been said about protomech technology. Some have even claimed they are invincible. I say read the rules about fire carefully. This shows their weakness.3060-A must for true battletechers"
