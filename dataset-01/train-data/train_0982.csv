5,The Dumbest Fun There Is,"This movie has 2 plotlines in the begining they say the taale of a COMMET past the Earth Leaving the planet in its tale causing electronics to kill people , in the end it says that aliens came to earth , died and possesed the electronics .But its better than other Stephen King Films like It(please tell me he wasnt A spider in the book) Christine(wtf)The SHining remake(in the 1990s everyone forgot it) The Shining from 1980 is however my favorite movie. But this movie is realy good and fun the visuals earn it 1 point(on a scale of 1 to 10) and the soundtrack(Who Made Who-AC/DC) earns it 2(on a scale of 1 to 10) points I could give it alot for having AC/DC do the soundtrack , More movies need to have AC/DC"
1,Great Perfect Cheese,This movie is great 80s cheese. The movie has great atmosphere and the music fits perfectly. BUT WHY is there NO WIDESCREEN?? This movie has been edited to fit your tv.
4,If only all Stephen King based movies turned out this well,"This movie rocks so hard. Emilio Estevez is just a bad @$$, plain and simple. He's the hero that knows exactly what to do at any given time. This movie has the greatest story. The title cards at the beginning and the end of the movie are key. The ending summing up everything is perfect. The head truck, aka the Green Goblin, is menacing and is the greatest bad guy. The explosions are just plain awesome. Of course this movie could have ended as soon as they find the weapons if they just blew up the Green Goblin, but hey not every movie is perfect. My only question is where is the director's commentary on this DVD? I want to know all the juicy details of this fine, fine film. ""WE MADE YOU! WWWWEEEE MAAAADDDDEEEE YYYOOOOOUUUU!"""
3,Not nearly the best Stephen King movie out there.,My son and I like it from a comedic standpoint. We find it humorous. We like the pop machine and steamroller scenes the best. Plenty of violence.
2,Steps on the gas to hard,"Athough this is movie of the ""B"" Movies that ""eeeeeeevvvvvvveeeerrryyybody"" makes fun of, it's not all that bad. While it wasn't a good Idea for Stephen King to do and have Emilio Estvez in as the hero, it still has it's good sides. Example? Sure! AC/DC does the score to the movie. They do almost all their songs, though, which makes it a little hard to understand. At the end, when all the survivors get away on boat and the dialouge says that a Russian Satilite kills the cloud (The weird alien cloud that was controling the cars and trucks), AC/DC completes the move with their #1 hit, ""you shook me all night long"" which is one of my favorite song. sort of good film, but best if you rent and not keep."
3,silly sci-fi,"This movie is somewhat entertaining, and the idea behind the whole thing definitely helps carry it,I for one did not like the ac dc music, it was annoying, matter of fact there are a few annoying things about his movie,but it is slightly entertaining and somewhat funny."
5,Testosterone Overload.,"This movie is for ""dudes."" You know those movies that are so bad, they're good? This is worse. It's NOT good. It is devoid of substance. Artlessness defined. And i love it. Trucks, explosions, guns, blood, chicks, and AC/DC. All you need is this flick, a wifebeater tanktop, a 24-pack of Pabst Blue Ribbon, and 2 or 3 unemployed buddies to share the beer and banality. The first time i saw this, after it was over i discovered that in 90 minutes my hair had grown long in back and i had developed a mustache and an intense need to work on an El Camino in the front yard. Amazing stuff. This is what happens when Stephen King directs his own materials--utter rot. Just don't watch it with your girlfriend--i can guarantee she won't understand (if she does, break up with her ASAP)."
2,Pure cheese.,"Back in 1986 this probably passed for good entertainment. We were nearing the end of a decade of glorious cheese TV (A-Team anyone?). It was just different back then. I remember seeing this for the first time in 1987 and actually being scared at some of the scenes, but now in 2007 I'm sitting here watching it and I'm extremely disappointed. If you want to hear ACDC just buy the albums. Skip this tripe."
1,Maximum Crapola!,"There's one thing I've learned about Stephen King films- they're either pretty good, or pretty bad. It's a hit-and-miss affair. In the case of `Maximum Overdrive', The bullet never even made the distance to the target. The only reason I was even attracted to it in the first place was the soundtrack by AC/DC, and even that didn't improve the movie's quality. Although I gotta admit that the ATM teller machine insulting the character played by Stephen King himself at the movie's opening is pretty hilarious. And King even drawls a pretty good Southern accent in response. Or was that dubbed in? I'm not too sure. Either way, it's one of the few high points in this whole sad affair.If you want to take a look at a good Stephen King flick, I suggest you pick up the theatrical version of `The Shining', `Stand By Me', or `Misery'.`Late!"
4,Maximum Overdrive,"Great horror. Stephan King gave me The Shivers. It's about demons taking over trucks, cars and machines. Who made Who? You will have to find out."
4,"Good movie, better story","I have seen the movie a couple of times, and it is a very good movie, but i personally perferred the story. The story is in the collection of short stories by Stephen King ""Night Shift"" and the story is Trucks. So if u would like something to compare the movie too, read the story."
3,Worth a rent for the AC/DC alone!,"Although this is one of the worst movies ever made from a serious point of view, it has some very big laughs as well. The bank scene, the AC/DC van and the Little League scene are all worth the effort of renting it. The soundtrack is downright hillarious. A movie that is so bad that it's good."
4,killer trucks!!!!,"I personally was not very impressed with this movie,however my four year old son LOVES it so I give it four stars for keeping him occupied."
3,"1 must pump gas,1 will not B harmed,1 must bring us lunch","This movie was a goof! even after I saw it Steven King himself called it a moron movie (the movie,not the ppl who watched it).The story is the earth gets tweaked by Halley's comet and all machines ""come too life"" attacking people,dogs etc. The AC/DC soundtrack was great (good choice). The movie had some cool scenes, my favorite was the soda machine that wasted those kids and their coach by shooting out soda cans! Yeah they got soda popped alright.You need to have a sense of humour for a movie like this.If you don't.. don't bother with it. Most famous line in the movie ""Mavis are you dead?""Yeardly Smith to her hubby"
3,Interesting,"I actually liked this movie. It was rather interesting, as will a lot of movies it has it's supidity and it's let downs in places, but in general, to me this was a good movie. Of course the very handsome Emilio Estevez truly helps the movie. Though that shabby love scene with im could have been left on the cutting room floor. If you haven't seen it, watch it, you might like it."
5,Stephen King's Best,"The best movie King has ever made! I like this movie for four reasons mainly.1)All AC/DC soundtrack.2)The Humor.3)Three words:TRUCKS,TRUCKS,and moreTRUCKS.4)The action. Some people wonder why the trucks don't just runover the truckstop. Well if you remember there's one part in the movie where the trucks send a message to the people through morse code asking them to gas them up."
3,What Were You Expecting?,"You read the box; knew what the premise of the movie was. Why the petulance? This movie is a classic cheese fest with good performances throughout.Pros: Decent acting, hilarious plot, unforgettable neighborhood sequence, awesome soundtrack, great pacing, awesome atmosphere, uproarious ending.Cons: The suspension of disbelief can be hard to swallow at times, but try and you will reap rewards.Whatever, this movie is awesome. I recommend it with friends, but, hey, its entertaining on its own. Good MST3000 material."
5,Horlarious,Maximum Overdrive is brutal and funny. Imagine a prowling ice cream truck out to kill anyone who gets in it's way. Or a coke machine that is out to eliminate an entire baseball team full of kids. It's classic entertainment for anyone who loves to laugh at horror movies.
1,It's a Shame,"I bought this movie for my son who has been wanting it for a long time. It was one of his Christmas presents. Waited a long time on it. I knew I would bc it was from the United Kingdom. But when we put the movie in, it wouldn't work. We tried 3 different dvd players and they kept spitting the dvd back out. It shouldn't even get one star. should have sent it back, but my son was so excited when it got here, he thru the return label and all info away. Sorry, yall better check on this seller."
5,Awesome movie,Been looking for this movie for a long time on dvd my husband and I love Stephen King movies thank you for this
5,Great condition for a hard to find movie!,The DVD arrived quickly and met all my expectations. It was in great condition externally and when we watched it. I couldn't have asked for better service or a better product. I highly recommend this movie if this is your thing and the service we received from vendor we bought it from. Thank you for making my husbands xmas a special surprise!
4,True,"We are losing war faster than described in the book. We observe ""others"" with our arogant glases and judge and measure them with our standards which have degraded so much. The politicians and media tell us we are The Greatest Nation on earth, and that we HAVE to lead the world and without our policing globally, the world will go to dogs!During my travelling abroad, I hear very derogatory remarks about us. There was a time, we were seen as great people and country. Not any more.All this because of our politicians and meia who are suservient to lobbyists and money."
4,Foreign Policy for level headed thinkers,"At times winded with history like the Old Testament, Imperial Hubris is a stiff rebuke to what mainstream talking heads say about this ""War on Terror"". Scheuer is both smart and controvertible in his telling of the war against bin Laden and Al Qaeda. Reading after the death of bin Laden, the book carries such insight into the motivation of Al Qaeda and why they fight. A must read for any citizen that feels the need to even discuss terrorism or the ""War on Terror"". A good citizen is a fully informed citizen and this is the book that gives you the back story, written by a guy who was there."
2,Monolithic Islam,"I didn't like this book, because it portrays all Muslims as one monolithic entity (they all love the Koran, they all hate Israel, they all are against the U.S.). As we see in Lebanon, Iraq, etc., there is a broad spectrum of Muslims, and to lump them all together the way the author does is not what I would expect from a CIA analyst with all that experience. It would be like saying in 1944, the Germans are all just nazis and can never change."
4,An Important if Flawed Book,"I had the privilege to see Michael Scheuer speak at the AQ 2.0 Conference several weeks ago and his panel discussion convinced me to pick up his book. The book raises several vital points in that despite three years since 911, the United States still isn't regarding the War on Terror as a real war. The strongest point is his insights on the perceptions of the Arab World and how Bin Laden's message is crafted to appeal there. Where the book falls short is that he identifies too strongly with the AQ and the Taliban and completely discounts our ability to influence them."
4,A sobering look at Islamic Insurgency,"While Scheuer has a few minor personality tics that shine through, overall this is a very well-written sobering view of Terrorism today and a wake-up call for America. I believe Scheuer is at his best in his analysis of Osama-bin-Laden as a charismatic, brilliant, deadly adversary who understands us a helluva lot more than we understand him."
5,Great Book,"This is the first time I see an American write an in-depth real study about Islamists and the Muslim world. I was shocked of the truth and sincerity in this book. I wish the next President whoever he is, will take the time to read it and LEARN from it. Muslims do NOT hate America for her freedom, they envy her and wish they could be as free and great as America. They hate America for her foreign policy and mostly for her double standard. What goes on right now in the Muslim world is a travesty and everybody knows that. I just hope that there will NEVER be another hidious attack on the American soil like the one of 9/11, Americans are very kind people and really do not deserve this brutality from Al Qaeda or any other Islamist organization. Ananymous hit the nail on the head, hopefully someone is out there listening to him."
4,You Can't Handle The Truth,"""Imperial Hubris"" contains interesting insights that are persuasive and compelling arguments. His refutation of the War on Terror is mercifully short and overly persuasive, although one is tempted to quantify each fact presented as if it were random occurrence. Eliminating international terrorism cannot be achieved by a bloated government ruled by partisan politicians who are more concerned about their own party than the actual safety of the American people. We have become the hunted lion in our own jungle. Anonymous has a writing style that can be tedious to read at times, but he seems like a nice guy. ""Imperial Hubris"" is filled with more references and useful information than I'll ever need, but that's what makes it so compelling to me."
2,Imperial Hubris,"I believe the reason for Bin Laden's actions as given by the author are incorrect.While American policies overseas are being used as a catalyst by Bin Laden to bring Muslims together in his jihad, the reason for the terror attacks are fundamental Islamic teachings. Bin Laden is attacking the U.S. because of our life style.(See p 152-153)Bin Laden is willing to stop the attacks if American people would convert to Islam. Bin Laden is even available to teach Americans how to be faithful. More research into Bin Laden's writing should have been conducted.Bin Laden's teachings are remarkably close to Islamic teachings and actions as far back as 700A.D. Where Muslims were believed fated to take power over Perian, Byzantine and European holdings.If they had strong enough faith."
2,Limited Hangout,"Except for being longer than it needs to be, this book would be perfectly all right if the official 9/11 story were true. But anyone who has actually studied for a while the readily available relevant material will conclude that 9/11 most certainly was an elaborate staged false flag operation. The author, as of the time he was interviewed for the recent History Channel program on 9/11 ""Conspiracy Theories,"" doggedly supported the official, completely discredited, version of the events of 9/11.While it is all well and good to oppose the hubristic policies of the Bush regime, the truth of the matter is that we are dealing with a reality that is quite different from the one Scheuer presents to us."
1,Imaginary Hubris,Wasnt convinced by the lame arguments presented in the book. Went in objectivly and found it to be complete nonsense. This anonymous coward actually in my opinion is aiding and abbeting the enemy from a propaganda standpoint. I regret ever putting my hand on this piece of filth. This book is proof of how far individuals will go in order to make a buck. Sad it is!
4,Almost Excellent,"Overall, this is a great insider's view on CIA work in East Asia and the ""War on Terror"". Mr.Scheuer does a nice job explaining the in's and outs of whats going on.Mr Scheuer provides his assesment early on, then goes chapter by chapter explaining why. I found the research well done, but some of the analysis off.Chapters on the ineptitude of the FBI, were funny, and did nothing to break the Stereotype on FBI /CIA rivalry.I recommend this book as a great birds eye view of what's happening in American/Eastern militant geo-politics."
3,repetitive,"I really liked the first 100 pages of this book. That's all one should really read because there is nothing new after the first 100 pages. The most illuminating chapter was the second: An Unprepared and Ignorant Lunge to Defeat - The US in Afghanistan. A lot of info I didn't know about in there. Besides the fact that our war effort is run more by PCness than strategy, they hate us for what we do not who we are, there isn't much more to take from this tome. At time Anonymous sounds a bit too laudatory of Bin Laden and his criticisms are sometimes too uncharitable. He doesn't think we should necessarily give up our war effort. But he thinks we need to be more efficient in defeating the enemy (kill more, let God sort them out), and change our interventionist policies which will alleviate the anti-American sentiment around the Islamic world.Anways, too darn long."
5,"Very original, informed book","Reading this book reminds me of reading Noam Chomsky the first time -- that original, analytic thinking can in fact be applied to political and strategic analysis. Don't laugh -- I am a physicist who had always thought social science is a bunch of mumble-jumble devoid of substance."
4,My Attempt to Understand Jihad,"Good read. A bit dated now in 2007, but still relevant. Also read ""Future Jihad"" by Waleed Faras if you want to learn about where these animals are coming from and ""Perfect Soldiers"", also sheds light on the breeding and conditioning of subhumans who would strap bombs on their children and send them to oblivion or attach innocent civilians in the name of a ""prophet"" who robbed the cradle, committed puligamy, and robbed and murdered his way to fame.Islam, the ""Religion of Peace""....or is that ""Follow Allah and be Blown to Pieces""?If you aren't serious now about the problem, either you will be after reading these books or there's no hope for you."
2,I will never read another book recommended to me by Osama!,"I was really looking foward to reading this book after all the hype surrounding it. This book seemed, to others in my family as well as myself, like a collection of what other people said in their books or newspaper articles. I just grabbed the book off of my bookshelf so that I could glance at it to help me with this review as far as what to write and I noticed something. A large percent of the pages that I flipped to had qoutes from other people. It seems like no matter what page I flip to I see *as so in so wrote in the New York times or just like so in so warned in 2002* it seems to never end. I personally just don't care for books like that, I think that it's cheap, not to mention the fact that it seems like if you've read one book about our present situation in the Middle East, you've read them all. I just couldn't get into this one."
2,who's on first?,"Starts off well, but once past drawing the general picture of what we face today, he goes off the deep end. I think the assumptions he makes on the way to his conclusions left him miscalculating and misinformed, therefore off the mark. Read for your self. But buy it used if you have read Lewis , Kagan or other works on the topic. I think you will be coming back to them, instead of hanging with ""anonymous"". I agree with the first reviewer, schizophrenic captures this exactly."
5,Great buy,I am really pleased with the quality and appearance of ths skirt for such an economical cost.
1,save your money,"$62.00 item worked 20 minutes. cost $30.00 to ship for repairs and back. they said nothing worng, get pro installation. worked fine for 1 hour, then all controls lock up again. the only way to gain control is to remove the face plate and reintall. touch the volume control and it locked up again. Sorry that is not an installation problem. They are not worth fixing, and tech support refuses to take responsibility for an inferior product."
1,Not a pleasant purchase,"Bought this CD-player for my girlfriend's birthday. The player worked for several weeks and then refused to play one of the CDs, and even didn't eject it, showing different error messages. The Reset button didn't work either. Had to send the unit back (together with the swallen CD) and get a partial refund. Also it was a constant problem to mount the front panel - you needed to bend it somehow that I was always afraid to brake it. There is no rubber pads in front of the CD ejector, so lots of dust can get in the CD-reading mechanism."
1,Keeping this thing working is a full time job.,"I REALLY wanted to like this thing, but it just doesn't work. It's frequency doesn't transmit through people, so when you throw a party, it just stops working. I wish I got the squeezebox because that thing will at least work over 802.11, but at four times the price, you really have to ask yourself if it's worth it."
4,Great inexpensive system,Installed with no problem and works at well over 100 feet. The only drawback is that you must have your computer on or you can't access the music library.
3,"Okay, but not great.","This system is great in some respects. It's fun to be able to use the remote to access all that music on your PC (I have around 6,000 songs) via artist name, song title, album name, and/or genre, and play it on your stereo. The negatives are that the sound isn't great (not terrible, just not all that high fidelity), and there are occasional drop-outs, especially when someone walks in the path between the transmitter and receiver. In my case, they are only about 12 feet apart, with a wall in between."
3,Very good if I can eliminate the interference,"Within its limits this device works very well. It was easy to set up & found all my tunes both ripped from CDs using Windows Media Player & downloaded from Napster. The remote has limited capability but enough to select the albums & tracks I want to play although slowly. Being able to add to the Playlist dynamically is nice.My biggest reservation is the interference. I've followed all the advice given but still have dropouts & ""clicks"" every 10-30 seconds. I need to do more to isolate & eliminate. If I can the rating jumps to 5 stars, if I can't down to 1 star (0 if possible)& I would want my $$ back."
1,none working charger,"The charger for the equipment did not work. Of course this took 4-5 dsys to find out. So the service was good but they never checked the equipment they sent me. Had to buy a new battery, and now a charger"
1,Worked only for 3 days total,The thing worked only for 3 days and after that that it just stopped working. The two pieces stopped recognizing each other. Got it replaced. And lo and behold same problem. In a couple of days they again stopped recognizing each other. They stopped getting in sync. So just think of at as a use it for 2 days and throw it away.Same problem with similar product from Logitech (Wireless music system).
2,sadly unreliable,"Enjoyed the product for one day, then it lost sync. Logitech web page support is useless. Will be returning the product now."
1,"Truly, truly unreliable","First, I've always like Logitech products, from their design to their usability. However, the Wireless DJ truly disappoints me because of its unreliability. Simply, the product does not work as marketed and promised. Now, how many unreliable devices do you have room for in your home and the extra time to resolve frustrating, basic problems? I suggest you save your hard-earned money and find another solution for your needs."
5,Not just another boom box,"With its sleek interface, and simple set up, I had the Logitech Wireless DJ Music System running in less than 15 minutes. For anyone ripping CD's into their PC, and looking for an easy way to play all their music through their home stereo, you just found your solution."
1,Not Vista Compatable,"I received this for Christmas and it worked fine until I bought a new PC that has Windows Vista as the operating system. Now, my Wireless DJ Music System is worthless. I have contacted the ""support"" on Logitech's web site and can not get a straight answer as to when (or if) they will provide customers with upgraded software to make this work with Vista. If you have Vista, be aware that you will not be able to use this product."
1,One More Reason To Hate DJ's,"Sure, the Wireless DJ will play your Protected AAC's, but it won't perform across anything close to the quoted distances in the real world. The one I received wouldn't connect reliably across a distance of 30 feet with one interior wall in between the computer and audio system.It can play your Protected AAC's because it doesn't have its own player; it serves as a remote that brings up the associated player for whatever song you ask it to play from your library. But, the remote functions ran too slowly to make the experience an enjoyable one for me.The product's claims say, YES! YES! YES! The product's performance says, NO! NO! NO!"
2,"Great Design, Problems with Performance","This was a breeze to set up and use. I had problems with low volume and frequent droupouts, even though the receiver was less than 30 feet from the transmitter. Found out accidentally that unplugging the power to the receiving unit cured both problems for the remainder of the session. The next time I used it, the problems came back. Logitech Support told me I had a defective unit. I returned it for a replacement. The new unit still had the dropouts, but not the low volume problem, and no way to cure it, even temporarily, so I returned it too. I would gladly buy this product again if Logitech could solve the dropout problems."
2,"Good system, but....","I was looking for something to stream my mp3s to my home stereo so I went to Best Buy to see what they had. The associate that helped me pointed me to this device. For $50 I could not pass it up. I bought it in November of 2007 and I had to replace the unit twice, about a year apart each time, but it was under the warranty fortunately. Whether it was the battery or the base unit that charges the remote that went bad I am not sure, but Logitech does honor the warranty and was very quick and professional in the replacement of the device. I would give it a higher rating (I really like the device) but the overall lifespan takes away some stars."
3,music all over,"works good, easy to set up... BUT.... you can't get a 2nd reciever for this... altho there are settings to have a few...to bad... but... it moves around easy..."
2,poor performance,"I purchased the product expecting to play music from my laptop using my Sony home entertainment system. The concept and design of this product is good. A receiver connected to my home entertainment system, a transmitter connected to my laptop, and a remote to control the music. It took only a few minutes to get everything setup, connected and playing music. I was at first very excited when the music played. However, in the span of not even finish playing one song, I already heard two or three skips in the song. My setup is simple. The receiver and the transmitter are approximately 9 feet apart in an open room. Yes I do have a wireless router around it but approx three feet apart. In my case, I already have a decent PC speaker system setup so it was not worth it to use this considering that is skips so easily."
2,does not function properly,"Many users complained of the music skipping. I thought this must be due to improper set up. I had guessed that since I am very proficient at setting up computers I would be able to get this device working. However, after spending many hours with this device it is obviously defective. I could not get the skipping to stop regardless of what other devices in my house where running. I have come to the conclusion that many of these are simply defective and cannot produce a streaming signal.I would have given one star but some people have not had a problem with it.I would not recommend against purchasing this product, regardless of your technical expertise."
1,Excelente diseño pero no funciona correctamente,"Vivo en Colombia y compré este prodcuto por que lo promocionó una revista de tecnologia de nuestro pais llamada ENTER. Fue muy facil de instalar, pero desde la primera vez que lo instale'en mi computador el la musica que reproduce en el equipo de sonido tiene caidas constantes. Escribí a logitech y no me dieron respuestas satisfactorias. Este producto solo funciona si el emisor y el receptor se ven de lo contrario hay constantes caidas. De otra parte el sonido de reproducción es muy regular."
1,Sturgeon is GREAT but the Kindle Version is...not,"Ted Sturgeon was one of the all-time great science fiction writers, and I was extremely pleased when the anthologies of his stories were reprinted. But the Kindle version of this book is gravely flawed. Why oh why would you publish ANY anthology and fail to include a table of contents? This makes the book entirely useless for browsing. I now face the unpleasant task of manually paging through the book and creating bookmarks for every story. Frankly, I'd like my money back, please.UPDATE: It turns out that the Kindle version contains ONLY the story ""The Perfect Host"" (hence, no table of contents.) So if you want JUST that story, you're good to go (but at a fairly steep price for a single story.) Amazon mistakenly lists this title as an alternate format to the short story collection of the same name. The good news: I DID get my money back."
1,"Great writer, but watch out for the Kindle Edition","Although the Amazon and Kindle information pages for this title suggest that the Kindle Edition is a full book of short stories, 408 pages long, it is in fact just one story. Great though Sturgeon is, you might want to save your money and buy the paperback version, which apparently is the full volume of stories."
2,Worthless!,"This handheld vacuum is a complete joke.. WEAK SUCKTION!!!! I would recommend the Dirt Sevil Scorpion, the Sunbeam handi, or the Sears Kenmore EVO hand vac..."
1,Don't Buy A Twin-Task!!!!!,"I think the StreamLight company is great, BUT....I have had nothing but problems with my Streamlight 51005 TwinTask 2L. First of all, be aware that the Lithium batteries and special bulbs cost an arm and a leg. Then, not only do you have to cycle through the triple selection LED's/Tungsten/LED's switch each time you use it, but the rubber ON/OFF button wears out quickly from the over-use. It's a beautifully machined flashlight--great looking--but an over-engineered pain in the neck. I've just sent it in to be repaired for the second time. At least they stand behind their productsOn the other hand, the two yellow, 4AA. 7 LED flashlights are fantastic and apparently indestructable. I'd recommend them any day.Raving Dave"
3,Looking for the shiny one?,"If you're looking for the silver-colored ""titanium"" finish (rather than black like this one), see ""Streamlight 51015"" instead."
4,Twin Task Streamlight beats Surefire,"This flashlight is extremely versatile, long battery life and very bright. I like the LED function for when I would prefer less light. I like being able to see my way with less light when I am attempting a recon mission, but like even more, being able to drown the area in light when I need it. I only wish the switch was a two way instead of three way. Right now it's Bright/LED/Bright then off. I wish they would do away with the last incadescent bulb flash. It makes shutting the light off in a hurry, difficult."
3,An ok light,"I purchased this light last week to use for investigations. The light is built like a tank. The pushbutton switch is a little annoying, as other reviewers have mentioned. The focus is pretty lame; the dimpled surface of the reflector prevents any real collimation of the Xenon beam. One of the LED's on my light works only intermittantly. It goes out and one has to whack the side of the light to get it to come back on. The light only has about 8 hours on it. I have yet to take it apart to fix the apparent loose connection. I'm glad I didn't pay more."
3,Poor switching method,"the light should have a seperate switch too toggle between led and xenon, so you don't have to push the button 3 times to get the light you want"
3,Ice-skating,"When I first read it years ago, I thought it was okay. It was good when you had nothing else to read. This is the story in a nutshell. There is this girl who loves ice-skating, but her parents want her to refrain from the activity, for fear she will get sick. When the girl skates, she sometimes gets sick. So she is put in this boarding school in order to stop her from skating. Naturally, she rebels and goes for the competition and wins first prize, etc. etc. etc. For those who can relate to her, it will be interesting, but frankly I did not like it much, but I think some kids may enjoy it. Cheers!!!!!! : )"
1,Simply put ---- Awful,I bought this movie because of Joan Collins -- Truely was a waste of good money --- No plot whatsoever --- And the Voices don't match what is being said by the lips --- like dubbed
1,"Love the watch, but we can't set the time!","The watch looks great, appears to be well constructed.Unfortunately, when tried to set the watch quickly found out the stem wasn't working. It pulls out correctly (per instructions), but seems to be problem with the stem/adjustment to set time on this watch.Will have to send watch back. If this is somehow a ""one-off"" problem with this particular watch - not a general defect - definitely would like to have proper working watch at the great price offered on Amazon. Hopefully, we can get a working watch back - will see."
2,"Somewhat good, almost not","Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of zz top but was a little disappointed in this release. The 1980 concert from germany is good but disc 2 I really did not like. The camera jumping all over the place with weird shots and fading I just did not enjoy. Not sure what zz top was thinking maybe they wanted to do something different from the live in texas yet it was a big turn off for me. If you are a zz top fan be sure you see it then you can make a judgment.Peter J. Miller"
3,Doesn't match my remagination: low energy and poor sound,"It's fun to see ZZ Top from their early days of 1980. This is the era I first caught their live act and, sadly, this video doesn't match the rich full sound and dynamic energy of my undoubtedly embellished memory of their act. Perhaps the Essen Germany stage was too small for Dusty and Billy to waltz around in synch. Perhaps its the watered down sound (or my muddled middle aged ears) - Billy's voice sounds thin and Dusty's voice is a crackling wail. The 2008 show has better sound, but here's a better DVD of their modern act:ZZ Top: Live from Texas."
2,SUCKING THE MONEY OUT OF YOUR WALLET...,THE ONLY REASON TO BUY THIS DOUBLE DVD IS FOR THE REMASTERED 1980 SHOW. I'VE OWNED THE BOOT OF THE 1980 SHOW FOR A LONG TIME AND AM GLAD THAT THE 1980 ROCKPALAST SHOW IS FINALLY OUT AND SOMEWHAT BETTER. THE SECOND DISC IS A TOTAL WASTE. IT'S LIKE WATCHING A AUDIENCE SHOT PILE OF CLIPS FROM DIFFERENT CONCERTS MIXED TOGETHER WITH A TRAVEL LOG OF WASTED CLIPS OF THE TOUR BUS AND WEARHOUSE SHOTS OF THE EQUIPMENT AND ANYTHING ELSE TO FILL UP THE DVD SO THEY CAN SELL IT AS A DOUBLE DVD SET. THE CONCERT RELEASED OF THE 2008 TEXAS CONCERT IS WHAT YOU WANT TO BUY.
4,"DZZTOP,Double Down Live","As much as I keep going to their concerts, this band is definitely a traveling Classic Rock Show and a shadow of their former selves. Thank goodness they included a Rockpalast concert where viewers can see and hear ZZTop at the top of their game. One can even see their eyes! The most recent concerts that I have gone to, they wear their sunglasses while playing. How hip, how rude. Could be any alien playing. How about giving the audience a thrill and play without your ""Cheap Sunglasses?"" That said, buy this, it's worth it for any ZZTOP fan. [...]"
1,Poor casting; lousy stands,"Along w/ everyone else here, I purchased these miniatures, thinking they would be up to snuff quality-wise w/ the WOC trade name. No go! The detail on the pewter is questionable, and the plastic stands were loose/wobbly or otherwise wouldn't fit. Going to have to resort to something else... glue maybe. Likewise, one of the characters had a shield broken off. Not a very happy camper."
1,Extremely disappointing,"I have to say I was extremely disappointed with these miniatures. Not only did my box only contain 5 of the 6 miniatures, 2 of the 5 I did receive were damaged. One bent out of shape and the other with a fist broken off. One also had a shield that was loose but that might have been the intention, just needing a bit of glue. While the damage could be repaired with a bit of effort and both shield and fist could be glued back on it was disappointing indeed.Last but not least the bar at the foot of the miniatures was different for all miniatures, so that only 1 of the 5 actually fit well in the footpieces coming with the set.The other set off miniatures (Monsters) was in a similar sorry state, though at least there all 6 miniatures were present (but 1 was unrepairable :("
1,Poor casting,"Same here as with the monster miniatures, the poor casting gives an anoying discoloration and some air bubbles do the rest to make this item not worth buying.All extruding part are bend in such degree that you cannot correct it anymore.It is a real pitty as the fine detail make these models 'want to haves' but the lack in quality makes it not worth your effort."
4,interesting reviews,I can see where some of you have some reason to complain. I do not see an issue with the shield. This is probably done intentionally so that someone who is interested in painting the miniature can paint the shield seperately then attach it afterward...not a problem for me. And bent pieces are common as well...the issue with the bases is also common and if you read up on articles from other professionals who paint these for a living you have to expect some issue with the bases...all you need to do shave some of the metal off the bottom of the figure to get it to fit...or use putty to fill in the gaps on the bases that are too large..for the price you cannot expect total perfection for 6 figures...I for one am extremely excited on receiving my set...and these complaints with the exception of the one about the bubbles will not discourage me. I have many figures including the new CHAINMAILs and have been very pleased with what I have received from WoTC.
5,"Not as much trouble as previous reviewers,","there was some flash but not enough to scream about. The detail in the figures is outstanding. Lots of work for someone with plenty of patience and a steady hand would really make these characters ""come to life"". Figures shipped seperate from bases, with one shield that needs to be glued on. This is left off to allow for more detail on the figure's hand area. Set received intact. Recommend this set for anyone with the 3rd edition D&D starter games as most of the figures (6 total in this set) are based on characters are based from there."
4,It's a robot's eyes!,It works well as a proximity sensor. However the schematics they provided are kind of sketchy. It's a bit over priced too...but in general it does the job and I am satisfied with this purchase.
3,nice!,"I like this coz I don't have to purchase a flea comb, comb..etc. It's an all in one product. My puppy likes this. The slicker brush was just too tough on my dog's skin and it scratches my skin too. It hurts!"
4,Where Are My Family Jewels??,"The search for the crown jewels of the czar continues! Meanwhile, the true identity of the Whispering Shadow grows foggier by the minute! Just who IS he?? Is it Professor Strang (Bela)? The odd Mr. Steinbeck? Someone else? There are many suspects in this last half of the story and those wacky jewels just keep hopping along, winding up with almost everyone at least once! Can Foster and inspector Raymond solve the mysteries before it's too late? Watch and see..."
3,"Super cheap, super OK","What do you expect? Note there are no ""clips"" or anything else that holds the plate in the frame except the screws. If your front plate hangs down from the bumper, the plate will be loose in the bottom part of the frame (in contrast with my garish stock dealer frame, which has little plastic clips to hold the frame in place."
4,Frame on!,"It's just standard license plate frame. I bought this to replace the one in the back of my truck--no free advertisement for my dealership. If they want me to keep their frame, then they should pay me a monthly fee."
3,Black plate frame,"got in in like five days using super saver shipping. There is only one not two i thought there was going to be 2 in the box my bad for reading the ""BulK Pack"" wrong. Its nice looking i wanted 2 but still good for the price"
2,misleading info,"From pics and title of Bulk packaging, i thought two where purchase. Not so. but at the price acceptable. Very flimsy. Shipping was a WTF. One frame in a large box, that could have held 50-100 of the $1 items. This was a multi-item order, all car stuff. All came in individual shippings, arrived over 3 days. i think 1-3 different carriers."
3,So cool to see this again!,"I watched this as a teenager back in Puerto Rico. It's a ""mexican"" spagetti western with Julio Aleman who was a big mexican star back in the day. Highly enjoyable if you like this genre. Loved watching this again. The dvd quality is so-so but watchable."
2,"I was disappointed, given all the hoopla re the book.","There seemed to be a lot of interest in this book, so I ran out (actually bought on amazon). The subject matter was interesting, but executed in a too-slow, too-schmaltzy manner. There are lengthy dream sequences that were pure torture to read. I suffered through them, only to reach a completely unsatisfying ending. Blechhhh."
2,Not on my top ten list,"This was a great book in the beginning but, as it wore on, the pace became slow and predictable. The last few chapters of the book were unclear and, honestly, annoying to read. All in all, I gave this book two stars."
2,"Great start, disappointing finish.","I loved the start of this book and couldn't put it down. But then it started to turn into a sort of ghosts and spirits book. The characters became unbelievable as well as the story. The ending was the worst. I too, skipped through the coma-type communications. Pity that a great story line didn't continue to the last page."
2,Too calculating to be moving,"Sometimes writers and publishers can just try a little too hard. Reading this book which I hoped would be a searching exlploration of a potential human tragedy, I became inceasingly uncomfortable with its frequently ham-fisted attempts at manipulation. I don't know if the author has suffered through anything like the events his novel describes, but on this evidence I doubt it."
2,"Great potential, but short on both substance & style","The story's premise is fascinating, and for that reason I saw it through to the end. But I found the characters a bit too stock, the research into consciousness non-existent (for example, the author routinely confuses unconsciousness and dissociation), the editing and structure sloppy and choppy, and, as someone else pointed out, the ending wholly unsatisfying. As for the dream sequences, the author would have been advised to leave that kind of thing to Stephen King and to not jump back and forth between the dream world and the conscious world. It also would have been a much stronger book had the author maintained a single point of reference with just one character.One highlight of the story was the grandmother. Her character was another reason I stayed with the story. In the hands of a skilled scriptwriter, the story could be transformed nicely for the screen and I vote for Dame Judi Dench as the grandmonther."
4,intriguing,"This story was a thrilling medical drama, filled with intriguing details of ethical issues and the limitless power of the human mind. Very different than my usual reading material, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
3,It was ok until the end.,"I was on the edge of my seat through the whole book, waiting to see how it ended. I waded my way through the dream chapters to see what happend at the end. The end was terrible, you are built up for a big climax that never comes and leaves you with so many unanswered questions. How far does Frankie come back? What happend to Ben, Lizzie, Janet......"
2,Not on my top ten list,"This book had a great beginning but as it wore on, it became slow and predictable. The last few chapters we unclear and confusing to some degree. More times than necessary, some sections discussed a particular character without saying who the character was."
3,Yellow old fashioned type of light beam,"It’s a great size although the head is bigger than expectedYes it is a very bright light but I have come to expect Xenon lights to be a very white light.This one is more like a krypton light from a Maglite, kind of yellow.When comparing my coast light (HP6) there is a definite size difference between the bulbs.I honestly don’t think this is Xenon light.When I can I will upload pics so everyone can see the difference"
5,Great light even though it's not LED,"Streamlight makes a quality product. Even though a majority of illumination tools are going the LED routwe for obvious reasons a good ol' incandescent light still is very useful. This light is well made and plenty bright. The only con for the average user would be the batteries that this light requires. Do not purchase in your local B&M, get them online for a much better price."
4,The best performing small-format light I've owned,"4 Stars because I don't give out A-grades very easily.I've seen the flashlight / torch customizing that occurs. There would be no supply if there were no demand. There's a demand for real light to come out of a flashlight when you turn it on. This TL-3 delivers real light. Straight out of the package. A focusable beam, a thumb-activated tailswitch, and 200 lumens +/- 13.Sure, LEDs are the future, but for sheer incandescent output, this light rocks! I can light up the top of my neighbor's palm tree and see with great clarity.There is one caveat : when adjusting the focus on this light, it is possible that the red rubber O-ring will grip the bulb and will pull it from its socket when adjusting the focus again in the opposite direction."
2,"OK for beginners, but","I was looking for a reference for Word 2004 that I could use to solve problems while I use Word. I am an experienced user and was hoping for something that would give me tips and insights into issues like how to work with anchors so that figures get positioned where I want them, and then stay there. Ms Langer's book is an introduction to using Word and is pretty much the same information you'll get from the online help. I've found it to be of little use for the issues I'm trying to address."
1,Hard to read,"I find the print quality very poor, especially for the example figures. Some of the print is so small and blurredthat I can't even read it with a magnifying glass. Otherwise the overall general text is pretty good."
2,"Great music, lazy cheap production","This is a highly acclaimed, even legendary artist. This collection of his ""greatest hits"" could have been so enjoyable, a real landmark item. Instead, it's irritating in the extreme. Despite being on two CDs, these recordings appear to be direct transfers onto a new media format, ALL THE NOISE is still on them, as if you're hearing old, ratty LPs!What an unpleasant surprise. Hissing, pops, static background noise. Very unfortunate."
1,The Very Best of Luis Mariano,Not happy at all. The Album was supposed to contained 50 songs and I received only one disk with 25 songs.
3,Didn't fit my stove,I have a Kenmore stove purchased in 92 or 93. Didn't fit my stove. Just FYI. I'm sure the bowls are fine on stoves they fit.
4,Fun cartoon for very young children,"Children under four will find this light cartoon with its catchy tune and imaginatively drawn characters lots of fun. We all have our favorite characters, and enjoy the rather moralistic plots that encourage children not to be greedy or selfish by imagining how things would be if they got their wishes. The Aussie accents are pleasant, too, and not overdone."
1,boring as can be,"the rubbadubbers has a great opening sequence. when we saw it on a bob-the-builder dvd, kid wanted to see it again and again.unfortunately, the opening sequence is the only part of this that is even remotely entertaining. the rest is just a series of boring stories, all with the same moral: it's more fun to share.here's my moral: it's more fun to watch a series with songs and/or fun characters. this has neither. try something else."
4,the class act of death metal,"I've been listening to this band for the past 20 years religiously . One of the best moments on this dvd is when Alex and Paul cross Chris Barnes onstage at a festival and they all shake hands and hug. Although I think George better complements their music nowadays, we can't ignore the fact that Chris Barnes helped put them on the map and is a true legend of the genre. The dvd chronicles the band on a world wide tour and is peppered with quality live concert segments. This makes a good companion piece to the stellar Centuries of Torment dvd and satisfies as an appetizer until the band serves up its next platter of splatter. Long ( live ? ) the mighty Corpse."
5,TNA at ITs BEST,"Monsters Ball 1Monty Brown VS Raven VS AbyssFOR THIS IS THE 1ST EVER MONSTERS BALL THIS MATCH WAS COOL !!!!!!!! 8.5/10Six sides of steelAMW VS Triple XGOOD TAG TEAM STEEL CAGE MATCH 8.5/10FALLS COUNT ANYWHEREABYSS VS JEFF HARDYI dont care WHAT PEOPLE SAY THIS MATCH RULED!!!! 10/10SIX SIDES OF STEELAJ STYLES VS ABYSS-GREAT CAGE MATCH AND AJ(AS USUAL) WAS GREAT IN THIS MATCH 10/10HOUSE OF FUNRAVEN VS SEAN WALTMAN- VERY GOOD HARDCORE MATCH, GOOD ENDING...9.5/10DOG COLLER STEEL CHAIN MATCH FOR NWA TITLERAVEN VS ABYSSBRUTAL MATCH, GREAT TO WATCH, 9.5/10JEFF JARRETT/RHINO VS SABU/RAVEN A GOOD match 7.5/10MONSTERS BALL 2RHINO VS ABYSS VS HARDY VS SABUGREAT MATCH, HARDYS Swanton Bomb WAS AMAZING!!!! 10/106 MAN TAG MATCHTEAM 3-D/RHINO VS AMW/JARRETT CRAZY BRAWL, 7.5/10BARBED WIRE MASSACREABYSS VS SABUBRUTAL!!

1,HERE WE GO AGAIN........,"The old WWF couldn`t take that WCW and ECW were Rising thesmselves over WWF-So WWF just bought them out but really ECW and WCW were actually doing better.TNA is better yet its gonna fall to WWE as Vince will sonner or later just buy it.So SHUT UP WWE FANBOYS AND ACCEPT THE FACT THAT TNA IS BETTER BUT THE ONLY WAY ITS GONNA FALL TO WWE IS IF WWE BUYS THEM OUT.So anyone just review the item as ""J-Green"" stated(the review with the Title:wwe and tna rants""plus whats reviewing gonna do the guys at TNA or WWE probably don`t even know you exist."
1,what this is really about...,"let me tell u what tna is like...its total nonstop action of people talking their heads off on a microphone. matches are only about 2 minutes long and the same people win EVERY time. you dont even have to watch to find out whats going to happen. even the WWE doesnt talk as much as they do. also, tna is just a trash dump for any WWE star who is fired and still think that they want a wrestling career. no joke. just look at the tna roster."
5,A Happy Lady,"I can't believe how incredible this footage is. Her Happiness is never better shown when she is laughing. The scene with Tippy( the dog being a dog) is so beautiful. She sparkles and shines, when you see her react to George Cukor. Also, so poignant is her emotions as she see the children who thought she was dead. The longing of love in her face will never be replaced."
4,somethings got to give,THIS IS A GOOD FILM. IT HAS BEAUTIFUL FOOTAGE OF MARILYN SHORTLY BEFORE HER DEATH. THE FILM MAKES THE VIEWER WISH SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE HAD BEEN COMPLETED.
4,Marilyn Monroe: Somethings Got to Give Documentary,"I bought this film because I adore Marilyn. But I was disapointed because it was more about her supposed ''problematic behaviour"" than it was about the actual footage. I would have loved to see more footage from this film instead of the comments and opinions of others. I still give it 4 stars because the footage that was in it was fascinating and proved to me that Marilyn wasn't the ""depressed"" star that she is often accused of being. It made me a little sad to see this at the same time because I think she would have made a brillant movie and give a great performance."
4,Somethings got to Give! and did :/,"The movie that was never finished, ""Something's Got To Give,"" was very nice to watch. I would have liked to see it finished! I did find the original movie that this was from, as ""Something's Got to Give"" was a remake of the movie called, ""My Favorite Wife,""(1940's) Irene Dunn, who started in Marilyn's Role and Cary Grant, who stared in Dean Martin's role. They did make this movie, however; it was recast and they renamed the movie, entitled,""Move over, Darling,""(1963) staring, Doris Day and James Garner. You can also see ""Something's Got To Give"" on the DVD, ""Marilyn Monroe, The Final Days, by 20th Century Fox. It also has Marilyn singing to the President JFK and a nude swimming pool scene of her that does show her bottom and one of her breasts for all of you men out there! She did have a nice body. Below is a link to ""Marilyn Monroe, The Final Days,"" by 20th Century Fox. Happy Viewing!Marilyn Monroe: The Final Days (Cinema Classics Collection)"
2,waist of time and money,Was very disappointing. Very thin and cheap made . I will use but dont think it will last long .
2,Quantitative Methods 8th Edition,"I am a professor using this book to teach a graduate level Quantitative Methods math class. This book is hard to understand for the students. Exercises included at the end of the chapters are hard to figure for the student based on what is presented in the text alone.For the instructor, no teacher support is available except a solutions manual. All other texts I have used provides sample lecture material, additional cases, etc. This text provides no such support with a useless web site."
2,Opaque at best,"This assigned text is a real slog for someone with no prior experience of QM but a reasonably good grounding in math. The study guide (sold separately) does not add clarity to the subject although it does provide explained solutions. I saved myself from being overwhelmed by taking a chance on Buglear, QM for Business, The A-Z of QM and was well rewarded."
5,Quantitative Methods 10th Ed.,Very in-depth.Most examples are from real corporate situations (though the company names are changed). Definitely a permanent reference guide to add to your book shelf after you complete the class.
3,"Cute, but can't you think?","Here's a nice bag of tricks for folks with thick heads. It reminds me of those late-1990s computer magazines, full of tips that aren't sophisticated enough for folks who know something about computers, but aren't likely to be employed by folks who are computer phobic.Michalko's offerings might help you think things through. But if you're a deep thinker, you won't need it. And if you aren't, you may miss some of the subtle import.Still, if you're stuck, y'gotta start somewhere..."
5,A great resource!,"I picked up a copy of Thinkertoys over a year ago; since then, I've recommended it to many people. The exercises contained within the book are easy to follow, and often make believers out of those who consider themselves 'not the creative type.' I used the 'circle of opportunity' exercise when brainstorming with coworkers in my office...interestingly enough, the coworker who was most resistant to doing the exercise (she considers herself a very analytical, logical sort of thinker) came up with the best idea.As a marketing/public relations consultant, Thinkertoys sits on my bookshelf right next to my thesaurus. It is an invaluable, easy to understand and enlightening tool."
5,Toco Toucan,"My son studies rain forest at school this year, and he is going to write a research paper about toucans (he is a 3rd grader). This was a reward for his research work and his curiosity. He loves it. I put 5 stars for educational value, since having the toy, actually helps him to write his story. The toy is soft and beautiful!"
3,Bad acting and a bit cheesy but I still love it,"I remember watching this on tv as a kid and never got a chance to see the ending. Funny, I don't remember the acting being SO bad but it is an interesting movie, especially considering all the different role-playing games that are out there now."
2,I only bought this DVD for the nice piece of Music at the start.,"It begins with a lovely theme song,that has nothing to do with the events that unfold,that, watching Chris Makepeace and seeing the"" mpire Strikes Back""Marque that brings back HAPPY memories,is ALL this movie has going for it."
1,"No, No, No!","It's all horrible, the acting (even Tom Hanks), the sets, the props, the writing, the lighting, the sound, EVERYTHING! I just barely made it through the movie. UGH."
4,Scorpions,"The Scorpions by Walter Dean Myers, is an excellent book. We never got tired of reading it. When you start reading the book you feel the excitement.Jamal's family lives in Harlem, New York. Jamal's older brother, Randy, is in jail for murder. Randy's best friend Mack is a member of the Scorpions gang that Randy use to control. Randy told Jamal to take over the gang till they get the money for his appeal, but Jamal doesn't want to at first. He knows his mom wants the money for Randy's appeal but his mom doesn't want him to join the gang. Do you think Jamal listens to his mom or Randy? Does Randy ever get out of jail?We would recommend this book to all our friends, because it is really good. It makes you think about life and the decisions you make. We give this book 4 stars because some parts were a little boring, and it was confusing at times."
4,The Hood,"This book takes place in the projects of Harlem ,New york.Theres a 12 year old boy named Jamal that joins a gang ""Scorpions.""He joins the gang to help his mom to raise money to get his brother out of jail. his brother is in jail for killing someone for the Scorpions.Now Jamal has to make a choice to help his brother or help himselfand his family.I really enjoyed this book there was alot of obsticles in this book that Jamal and his family has to overcome. I recomend this book to alot of kids in Jr. high cause it really relates to teenagers like us . what are you waiting for go get te book ""Scorpions"""
4,How to survive on the streets.,"It is hard to survive on the streets of New York. There are gangs and people always getting into fights. You constantly have to be on the lookout for groups of teens and bullies. You never know when a bullet might stray your way. But, Jamal and Tito, two New York teens, who are best friends, need to cope with this life. Jamal lives with his mom and his sister in an apartment. Tito lives with his grandmother. Jamal's brother was the leader of a gang called the Scorpions until he was arrested and placed in jail. Jamal's brother wants him to take his place as leader of the Scorpions. He told Jamal to see Mack about it. When Jamal went to see Mack, Jamal said he would be the leader, but things get a little shaky after he gets a gun. Scorpions is adventurous, nonpredictable and it is an exciting book."
5,Scorpions is pimp,"The Scorpions is cool! The book takes place in Harlem, New York. Pimps, guns, gangs, drugs, and other stuff is involved with this part of Harlem. Jamal is twelve years old and his brother Randy is in jail. Mack, from the Scorpions, tells Jamal that Randy wants him to get him bail him out of jail. Dwayne, a bully at school, is picking on Jamal all the time, so he might do something he might regret. The ending is unexpected and you won't believe of the stuff that happens."
1,CHANGE RATING TO GOOD.ON THIS BOOK,".I WISH I COULD GIVE A BETTER RATEING. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IT IS NOT ALL THE INFORMATION.THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN . BEEN DISCLOSED THE BOOK HAS A GREAT STORY BUT NOT ALL THE FACTS. ALSO THE GRAMMAR IS BAD AND I DONT BELIVE OUR CHILDREN SHOULD READ THIS . MY GRAND DAUGHTER HAS TO READ IT ,BUT SHE DOSENT LIKE IT AND THE GANGS IN OUR WORLD ARE TEN TIMES WORST."
1,it was beyond bad,"to say a few words. the little children here do not have understandment what this book was about. it had no meaning to life only that there is a poor kid... and all that like in every book i read. awefully it was on my summer book report and i have to say that it was aweful. the plot was not even solved only half of it was. if you would want a good book dont listen to a 12 year old tell you. if there was a zero or a half star this book would get the lowest rating. if you read this book, it is nothing compared to life."
2,Scorpions,"""Scorpions"" By: Walter Dean MyerI read the book Scorpions. I read this book because I have read some other work from Myer. I have liked some of Myers' other work but this book did not interest me.I found this book to be rather unentertaining. This book in my understanding of the book did not really have a point. Also I thought it had no ending.This book was about a boy named Jamal. Jamal's older brother Randy just got put in jail. Randy was the leader of the scorpion gang and Randy wants Jamal to take the gang. But the other members of the gang don't want a twelve year old to take over the gang. Jamal's mom needs to find a way to get a thousand dollars to appeal Randy's case. While in jail Randy gets stabbed.Then after that the book just kind of ends. The book over all is unentertaining but the end is the best part of the book."
2,SCORPIONS/JOINING GANGS**,"I thought this book was okay.They use alot of slang,like I ain't and You ain't.It's about a boy named Jamal who has a brother named Randy who's in jail because he killed someone.Now he wants Jamal to take over the SCORPIONS gang.Jamal lives with his sister Sassy and there mom because the dad just left and they never found out why.But when he came to visit he had to leave soon because he had to work.They all was trying to think of how to get Randy out of jail.Will Jamal join the Scorpions?And will Randy get out of jail? Read the book to see what happens."
5,This book off the chain,This book is like real living and when my teacher said we was going to read i was like ummmm boring but when i started reading i could not stop reading it.
1,Bad Grammar,"My child, who will be going into the 6th grade, was assigned this book for summer reading. It has very bad grammar, that my child had a hard time reading it. I do not beleive it is an appropriate book for a child just finishing 5th grade."
3,An exciting book!,"""Scorpions""Written by: Walter Dean MyersIf you like books with mischief and excitement then ""Scorpions"" written by Walter Dean Myers is for you. This book takes place in Harlem, New York. Randy, Jamal's older brother is in jail. Will Jamal's mother be able to get Randy out of jail? Will Jamal take his brother's place in the Scorpions? Well, you will just have to read the book to find out. We would not recommend this book because there was not as much excitement as we thought it would be. We give the book three stars.Book review by: Jessica Flores and Brooke Gordon"
5,The Review of Scorpions By April Thompson,"This was the best book I have ever read. I think this would be a great book for students my age. It shows a lot of responsiblity and some determination. I think people will enjoy this book. Its about a kid who is determined to help release his brother out of prison by getting an appeal for $2,000.00! Throughout the book he has more problems on his on. Being the leader of the Scorpions,having a gun and its problems, teachers,and,a bully name Dwayne. He goes through a lot with his father also. So all yuo people out try and read this book! It's five stars!"
3,The mediocre book I read,"I like the book,but sometimes there were words that I didn't understand or know to pronounce. Some words such as bodegal caused me to not understand part of the book. Although I don't understand some words,I'm beginnimg to learn more of them. My favorite part of this book was when Jamal had to deal with alot of problems after he brought Mack's gun to school."
4,Scorpions,"Scorpions is an engrossing and well written book. It was so great that it recieved the Newbery Honor, and a few other well deserved awards. The main character, named Jamal, was very brave because he was able to stand up to bullies and gang members. Jamal is also very scared sometims because he chickens out during fights and gets beaten up all the time....I reccomend this to grades 5 to 7."
4,A Book Review,"Scorpions by Walter Dean Myers was a book about a kid named Jamal growing up in the ghetto. He had a lot of anger, and has no real release for it, so he fights. He gets involved with gangs, and drugs. He lives in the projects, and is the same condition as the inner-city kids, taking care of what's left of their family. The drugs he gets into only make him more violent later on. He is forced to find out who his real friends are. I liked the book because it keeps you interested. People who like horrorcore music would like this book because it talks about the same conditions that they rap about."
5,Very moving,"I remember reading this book in seventh grade (I'm now a sophomore in college). It was almost immediately one of those books that you couldn't put down. It is an extremely moving example of literature at its best - it captures ever emotion you have and it keeps you on pins and needles the entire time you're reading it. I remember finishing the book and thinking ""WOW!""This has been one of the few books that really moved me and it has definately instilled in me a desire to be a better person. It is a book that anyone at any age can appreciate. It's definately worth reading."
4,scorpions,"I REALLY LIKED SCORPIONS BECAUSE IT TALKS ABOUT PEER PRESURE,VOLENCE,DRUGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.IT HAS TO DO WITH TEENAGERS ALSO.IF YOU DONT LIKE READING YOU WILL LIKE THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT GOT OUR GROUP TO START READING BETTER AND LONGER.IT GRABS YOU ATTENTION AND IT KEEPS YOU WONDERING WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT.THE MAIN CHARATERS IN THIS BOOK BOOK IS JAMAL,THE LEADER OF THE SCORPIONS BROTHER,TITO HIS FRIEND,AND MACK SOMEONE WHO IS IN THE SCORPION GANG.JAMAL WANT TO JOIN THE SCORPIONS SO HE CAN MAKE SOME MONY SO THAT HE CAN GET HIS BROTHER RANDY OUT OF JAIL.SO MACK AND INDIAN MAKES JAMAL THE LEADER OF THE GROUP.SO JAMAL GETS INTO A FIGHT WITH A BOY AT HIS SCHOOL NAMED DWAINE.DWAINE IS OLDER THEN JAMAL.THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK FOR KIDS 12 AND UP."
5,Scorpions,"The setting of the book Scorpions, was in the New York's ""ghetto"". The whole story starts out in the ""ghetto"" with a boy named jamal,he's a everyday kid, but his cousin ""Tito"" was in jail from something he did with the group ( Scorpions). Jamal's mom tells Jamal not to go near tito or the Scorpions, but Jamal is a typical boy and he still goes around them. Jamal is forced to lead the Scorpions, when they gave him a gun, everything just went doen hill for Jamal. This is a very good book, i give it all five stars. I recommend this book to anyone becuase this book is some how a mystery and a adventures book."
4,The best book I've read in a while,"The book scorpions was anawsome book. It inspired me not what the book is about but what, but to read more books like it. I really thought thatthisbook was great because it teaches you how to deal with problems in your everyday life. This book is suspensful, exciting, and always keeps you reading. This book is also very good at teaching kids how todealwith bullies, and perr presure. If you don't want to read this book your crazy. I mean this book as my title says is the best book I've read in a while. Overall this book is awsome."
4,Scorpions,"I think the book was okay because it showed what happened in real life. It was about a boy who really didn't have a rep then his brother who went to jail and told his little brother to take over the scorpion wich is a gang. So Randy's friend who's name is Mack, gives Randy's little brother a gun to join the gang. After he joins the gang his life dosen't do nothing but go down hill."
5,Scorpions,I thought this was a good book. You could learn somEthing from this book. It is mystery also having to do with choices. This is a good teenage book it has to do with gangs a gun and everything.Jamal has to make a desicion of being the leader of the scorpions and getting rid of the gun. Also jamal older brother is in jail for shooting someone and jamal mom is all messed up because jamal starts getting into trouble and now she has to worry bout jamal little sister sassy no to do the same things. SO i think if you are a teenage kid you should read this book.
3,The Scorpions,"When reading this book it got me hooked into it because it always had something significant happening. For example, it is like an action movie because there are a lot of fights happening. This book also made me realize what some people have to deal with in the world. Like how Jamol had to live in a neighborhood filled with gang actvity and how he has to deal with drugs and guns. The book was greatly constructed to keep you reading and has a really good plot. But there are some down points in the book, like it is very depressing and there is no point in the book where something good happens. It just keeps getting worse for Jamol. Although it has no good points I still recommend this book."
4,Scorpions Book Reveiw,"The Scorpions is about a twelve year old boy that lives in Harlem, NY. His name is Jamal Hicks. He has to be in charge of this gang called the Scorpions. His brother Randy was the gang leader before Jamal, but he's in jail now. Jamal has to earn money for Randy's appeal. Jamal has trouble in school because this guy named Dwayne always picks on him. But his best friend Tito always has his back. My favorite scene in this book was in the very end when Tito was moving to Peurto Rico and he and Jamal had to say good-bye to each other. Tito didn't say good-bye to Jamal at first, but then he stopped the car and got out and gave Jamal a hug and a kiss and left forever. It was almost like real life. I give this book four out of five stars. The appropriate age group for this book ranges from 12 to 14 year olds. I also recomend this book to anyone who enjoys drama. I enjoyed reading this book the whole time!!!"
4,Scorpions,"Jamal, is an average 12 year old kid living in Harlem. He has a brother named Randy who is the leader of the Scorpions gang. While in that group Randy was put to jail for murder. Jamal will do anything to get him out. Randy sent his friend named Mack to tell Jamal to join the gang. At first Jamal says no, but he figured if he could get enough money he could get Randy an appeal. When Jamal joins he is beat up because two other people on the gang don't want him to take over, and don't think he has the heart. Tito and Jamal decide to try to quit the gang, but one of them is sadly involved in homicide. To find out what happens read Scorpions by Walter Dean Myers."
4,Scorpion's Review,Scorpions is a good book I would rate it a 4 - 4 and 2 3rds star rating I liked the part in the end when Jamal is getting beat up and Tito shoots the bad gang guys. I think that this book is for ages 12-16. I liked this book because it has action and it isn't boring but the most important thing is it tells you not to get into gang violence. Scorpions is a good book
4,Scorpions,""" The deal went down the way the deal went down! You on the street , you got to take what the street put down!""After Randy was sent to jail for murdering someone, Jamal, his brother, is put to a hard task: being the leader of the Scorpions.The gun Mack is offering him for being a leader of the Scorpions will give him awesome power, but will it put Jamal and his best freind, Tito, in danger for life?The question is asked and answered in Walter Dean Myers book, Scorpoins. Walter Dean Myers takes you into the streets of Harlem to experience what its like to be in a gang."
4,EXTRA CREDIT,The book scorpions is one of the grastest books made. It couldof been a five star if the writer mabe me thing about what was goingto happen next. This is almost the only book I have read the whole thing. This book is a great to read to the class for teachers. I thing there could of been more mistory to it but other wise it was a great book. There was planty of action in the book. I thing this is a good book to read to some one or by your self at any age....
3,Scorpions is a very touching book.,"Scorpions is a very touching book. It captures the values of a family dealing with problems. Although being touching, Scorpions is a very rambled story. The author prolongs events causing confusion in some parts of the book. In any case Scorpions is a book that reminds us that no matter how bad we think we have it, there is someone who has it worse than we do. Scorpions is a book that I would recommend to anyone who is having a hard time."
4,scorpions by Walter Dean Myers,"I really enjoyed reading the book scopions by Walter Dean Myers. The book is about a boy named Jamal. Jamal is 13 years old. Jamal has a brother named randy. Randy is the leather of a gang named scopions.Randy goes to jail for murder. Randy was involve in a gang shoting. Jamal lives with his mother, brother and sister in Harlem.I recommend this book to all the readers that like the book monster and other books by Walter Dean Myers. I give this book 4 stars.By: Jossian P"
2,"Unless You Speak Japanese, Skip This VHS Tape","I was aware before I bought this that there would be Japanese subtitles. I assumed that English subtitles would be superimposed over them. This was not to be. There are Japanese subtitles only. In addition, Madame Caballe was not, in my opinion, having a good night. The voice often sounded somewhat hoarse and strident, as if she were really tired. Secondly, she kept running out of breath and hurrying the tempo so she could finish the phrase. My favorite aria, Poveri Fiori, was a big disappointment. And the picture quality is absolutely dismal, worse than you can imagine."
4,Io son l'umile strikes again,"Adriana is almost a one-aria opera, but what an aria! This production features four well-known stars performing as they should. Gavazzeni keeps things under control. One hears Io son l'umile ancella early on to get one in the proper atmosphere. Peter Dvorsky, Fiorenza Cossotto, Ivo Vinvo, and Mirella Freni all turn in solid performances. The La Scala audience does get involved, whether they hate you or love you. They loved these folks."
5,Beautiful!,"Having heard Adriana's beautiful aria several times here and there, I wanted to hear (and see) the whole opera - which I have done now. I read a reviewer complaining this aria came up too many times. What rubbish!The music is beautiful all through (the said aria only appearing twice, maybe three times), there are several wonderful arias, and in this recording Mirella Freni is fantastic!Would love to see it live one day!"
2,Too much Denizen Kane,"The first album was a classic, but on this album, the beats feel more organic and Denizen Kane has lame flow on just about every song. The true talents of this group are Qwel and Qwazaar and they simply aren't on this record enough to make it a worthwhile purchase like the first record. I urge you to buy ""the harvest"" by Qwel and Maker instead. Very disappointed that this record was such a let down"
2,"Great bags, but too expensive","These clear bags work very well on my Jet DC-1200CK, but they are way too expensive. Thus the reason for only two stars. If one is willing to purchase a carton of 100 bags it's much cheaper to use a company like ULINE at www.uline.com (I have no vested interest in ULINE, but did a simple search for similar bags)."
2,thrice the price,"These bags are too expensive. I went down to the local hardware store and bought a box of 20 ""contractors"" cleanup bagss for thirteen dollars. They are made of heavy duty (black) plastic, and they fit into the dust collector (actually they are a little long, but if you overlap them over the retaining ring by a foot, they work well). They are sturdy and hold up well. I have been doing this with my dust collector for the last year and it works well."
2,Expensive and prone to holes,"For the price these should really be constructed better. A recent box had two that split along the bottom seam, and two that punctured within a few days of installing. The punctures were from debris sucked into the collector, not from anything hitting the bag externally. Unfortunately you usually find the hole(s) after you realize your shop is getting 'foggy'. Hours spent cleaning sawdust off everything is better spent making more."
4,Dust Collection Bags,"These bags work fine, but they are very pricey. I am in the hunt to try a cheaper alternative. These bags are painful to throw away due to the price. I will continue to search for a more cost effective product."
2,Beautiful to look at. Wished the crystals didnt fall out though,"This watch is very nice. However, the crystals fell out while still in the box. Very strange. Reading the fine print in the warranty from Citizen, this is not covered. I would choose a different watch."
1,range knobs,I purchased these knobs to replace the ones on my GE profile rangetop. They look nice but do not work. They don't go down far enough to allow the stem to turn. They come with adapters but neither did the trick. Not satisfied
3,Needed a bit of modification.,"I think these must be the only replacement knobs available on the planet for my old stove, so I shouldn't complain. However, just like the last set of knobs I bought (YEARS ago) they are too hollow inside to push down on the stems that control the heat on my stove. Luckily, we have a handyman in our house that figured out how to modify the insides of the knobs by adding a metal crossbar. Now they work great!"
1,Skip these...,"These don't work for cook tops unless your posts stick significantly up above the metal. Quality isn't great either. Not a fan here, but could be a cheap solution that works for others..."
1,Useless Knobs,Useless KnobsDo not buy. Waste of money. Cheap useless stuff. They will not fit any current push down type gas ranges.
1,Range Knobs Didn't fit,I have a GE gas range and these knobs fit on the stem - but the knob has a side wall which prevents pushing the knob in before turning. They just do not work - no way around it.
5,A reliable power source for supermoms,"I'm a single mother of a seven year old with ADHD. My friendly robotics lawnmower that I bought last year was a godsend. Generally the battery lasts long enough on one charge to mow either my front or back yard. With a backup power source, I will be able to do my whole yard in one morning while my son sleeps or runs around the yard with my attention on my kid, not the lawnmower. This is the best form of multitasking that has ever happened."
4,robomower battery,Well its a large battery. It still works. I love my robomower and the battery is necessary for it to run. I wish the battery life were longer.
3,FYI,This battery is for the older robomower models such as the RL800 and RL1000. Somebody correct me if I am wrong but I believe it is slightly different from the battery used in the RL850.
1,HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS ORDER,"THIS HAS PRETTY MUCH TURNED ME OFF THE ROBOT MOWER. ORDERED A NEW BATTERY APRIL 30. STILL HAS NOT EVEN SHIPPED AS OF 5/31/06,MEANWHILE, I'M USING NEW BATTERY POWERED WALK-BEHIND. I DON'T KNOW IF THE NEW BATTERY WILL EVER ARRIVE AND THEN NOT SURE THE ROBO MOWER WILL WORK WHEN IT DOES GET HERE AFTER THIS LONG OF WAIT.VERY POOR, POOR SERVICE.LINDA ROBINSONSEMINOLE, TEXAS"
1,waste of money,"if you were expecting a dual language disk, you'll be sadly disappointed!i pop in the first DVD and looked for ""English"", imagine my surprise that meant ""English subtitles only""so, if you favor Japanese; enjoy. however, i am a big supporter of both and i like to get my money's worth. never release a series without both languages people!!"

3,Far too many camera cuts on the DVD,Every filmaker and editor should watch Heart of Gold and Stop Making Sense before producing a concert DVD. Why is the viewer subjected to a camera change every three seconds (or less)? I find it distracting to the point of being unwatchable. I would really like to know what the thinking was that produced a viewing experience that stands in such stark contrast to the experience enjoyed by the people who were actually at the concert. Do the artists themselves have approval over the finished cut? It is hard to imagine that Mark or Emmylou would have signed off on this...
1,Bad mix,"I have enjoyed many of these songs on CD (a previous version, not the one that came with this set) but felt the DVD mix was poor, particularly no punch in the vocals despite trying all the soundfields on my receiver."
3,The Studio CD is much better,"""All The Roadrunning"" is a terrific CD and I highly recommend it. This, the live version, is less so. First, it's expensive. Yes, you get a DVD and a CD. But for all the talent that Knopfler and Harris have, they're simply not entertainers. They're very low energy. One reviewer who gave this package 5 stars said he liked to listen to the DVD but not watch it. That's because there's not much to watch. Second, there are too many instances where the vocals aren't very clear. Sometimes it's a function of the recording quality or the mix, and sometimes the singers aren't enunciating. If you're already familiar with these songs, maybe you won't mind that, but it was a problem for me -- I want to hear the music AND the lyrics. And third, as if often the case in concerts, the songs all go on much longer than they should. There are too many instrumental vamps, interludes, jams and indulgences...and they're boring. So my advice is to stick with the studio CD."
2,yuk,"The camera work and the editing looks like it was done by an 8th Grade shop class.Nearly unwatchable.Jittery, bad framing, focus problems, poor choice of cuts.The first ten minutes of performance before they are onstage was a clue.My dog shoots better video.I love Mark Knopfler and Emmylou is always at least interesting.You'd better be a diehard desperate fan to pay for this one."
3,"OK, but....","stick with the studio version. Which I happen to feel is the best album of the year. This version is ok, but only get it if you already love the studio version."
2,Damaged,"Disk one is great, I love the songs and the sound is excellent. However, disk two is damaged and will not play. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning it for a replacement!"
5,Great Live album,"Generally speaking I am not a big fan of live albums but this one is different.It is not a copy of the regular album. the recording is great you hear the live performance without too much ""noise"" of the audience.Booth the DVD and music album are great to look or listen to.There are quiet a few new songs. Just great pleasure to listen to"
5,A very nice pairing,"Mark and Emmy sound great together. Of course, Emmy sounds great with about everyone she decides to work with! I've listened to this CD over and over and like it more everytime I hear it. Mark has a very distinctive style which rolls over into neo-traditional country/bluegrassy stuff very well. Nice."
4,"Great live versions plus more, of the best disc of 2006.","Great live versions plus more, of the best disc of 2006."
2,Just Doesn't Work,Maybe it's the song selection but with all the great songs to choose from it seems they tried hard to put a lot of clunkers on here. Too bad - it is a missed opportunity. Avoid!
5,You must see this DVD,"This is one of the best performances I have ever seen in my life. And its in my living room. The blend of Mark Knofler with Emmylou is beyond compare. The band is made up of accomplished, multi-talented musicians. Mark lets the band breath - steps back and lets Emmylou and others perform while he quietly watches. No super rock star ego trip from him.The DVD contains more songs than the CD - to the extent that when I want to play it I just play the DVD.I was a little aggravated when I had to buy the CD again, for the live version. Nevermind. I would pay twice the price."
4,Two legends do not disappoint or amaze.,"I ordered this CD with high hopes. While I was not disappointed, I wasn't blown away either. So I guess you could say I was, in fact, disappointed that I wasn't blown away =) Mark is the greatest guitar player of all time and one of the all time greatest songwriters ever. Paired up with one of the most beautiful voices and songwriters of all time, I had hoped for more new song writing collaborations as well as shared performaces from them, but instead, Mark did stuff mostly from his Golden Heart album, while Emmie Lou did stuff mostly from Red Dirt Girl. Don't get me wrong, it was all GREAT, but they only even shared the stage for about half the concert/dvd. I think Mark was by himself for 3/4 of his songs, while Emmie Lou was alone for half of hers. All in all it's a great album/DVD, but buy it knowing there isn't a lot of new stuff or collaboration between the 2. I give it 4 out od 5 stars."
5,Geat Stuff,I like this album and DVD so much that I purchase them as gifts. What's really special I think is that there is a big difference between the live performance and the CD. The CD as it is a studio thing is quieter and almost contemplative with the DVD being live much louder. Great stuff for both mediums.
5,Excellent concert,I was so impressed with this DVD. Excellent production values + a great concert. Emmylou and Mark cover a number of tunes that each recorded as a solo in addition to cuts from their album together. Highly recommended
5,A master piece,"It was a gift for my wife, but once I watched the movie, I liked the plot and music. Very interesting for our western likes. I think it's a hidden and unknown (for us) master piece."
1,The Master and the Margarita,"What a disappointment the movie was. I was so anxious to see the movie having loved the book. But the movie starts with dialogue with no translation (no subtitles). Who would dream that there might be passages of 3 minutes with no sub-titles. I came to the natural conclusion that subtitles weren't on the discs. I am returning the discs. Might be cutting off my nose to spite my face (I wanted to see the movie), but I don't want to wait minutes on end to know what is happening. How do they make a 7 hour movie from a book which was only 200 - 300 pages long???"
1,Where are the subtitles?,"I would love to learn to speak and understand russian. unfortunately, that will take some doing, and some time. i ordered this dvd set sot too long ago, and since it is one of my favourite books was really looking forwrad to it.and there are NO subtitles. the menu only has the option of watching the movie or skipping to a new chapter. i dont care if the titles aren't perfect, but i need SOMETHING. i am very very unhappy. i've got my fingers crossed that i ust somehow missed the option. where the devil are my subtitles???!"
1,More awful than I could have imagined possible,"This DVD was a huge disappointment. Everything about it is just wrong. The cinematography is clunky and amateurish, everything is overlit like a daytime soap, the acting is stiff and unconvincing. The character of Woland looks more like a tired old pensioner than the Prince of Darkness. The whole thing looks like as it's been made by a group of not particularly talented film students.I was bitterly disappointed. Bulgakov's novel deserves a much better treatment.Do not waste your money on this disaster."
4,A must have for collectors,An extraordinary adaptation of a classic. My only negative comment is the lousy out of sync English subtitles.
5,The best version I've seen,"This extraordinary film is a must-see for any fan of Bulgakov's masterpiece. I was astonished to see the book spring to life before my eyes, a carnival of the imagination, see it!"
4,First time reader,This is the first time I have read the Holy Quran. I find that this is anexcellent copy and easy to read. It was beautifully bound and makes a very attractive addition to my collection of books.I would encourage anyone interested in learning about the Quran to purchase and read this. If everyone would open their minds to reading about our different cultures and religions we would all have a better understanding of each other.Peace be among you!
4,"Good English translation, but Arabic typeface is too ornate for novice readers","Yusuf Ali's English translation is positioned as the column to the left of the column of the Arabic text. The Arabic text, however, is somewhat difficult to read because the ornate typeface employed is too distracting. I preferThe Meaning of the Holy Qur'anby Amana Publications of Beltsville MD, which uses a much plainer and easy to read Arabic typeface that is similar to that used in beginning Arabic language textbooks. The Amana Koran is more suitable for novices such as myself. The Amana Koran employs the same English translation by Yusuf Ali as this book published by Muhammad Ashraf."
1,Pages out of order!!!!,The pages are out of order!!!! Unless you're paying attention to the page numbers it's hard to catch!!! You need to flip back and forth to finish most of the stanzas and it completely changes the message of the book!!! Not happy!!!!!!!If I wanted to page around so much I'd have bought a flip book!!!!
5,A gift for Western readers!,"As a non-Muslim, I have read or at least sampled several English translations. All of them have attempted to convey the power of this revelation, while warning the reader that its true essence can only be grasped in its original Arabic form. That said, this translation is by far the best I have encountered. The translator states in the introduction that completion of this volume (in the 1930s)was his life's ambition, and his dedication shows. The included commentary provides historical, cultural and theological background which makes even obscure passages (to this American reader) meaningful. I think the fact that the translator lived in a multi-cultural milleu (pre-partition India) somehow gives breadth and accessibility to his commentary. In sum, this translation makes it possible for a reader to appreciate the Holy Quran as a guide to everyday life, and wonder how its words might impact a listener in its original tongue."
3,Good Translation - not Holy,This is a translation of the Arabic Quran into English. It isobviously beneficial for those non-Arabic speaking individuals who areinterested in what the Quran contains....
1,A Must read,"I read the book, front to back. I'm perplexed as how muslims can claim to be peace loving, non-violent, non-male domineering, while within the text of the book there are specific ""commands"" to the contrary. The writings itself are very contridictory. ""scripture"" here does NOT interpret scripture.I would recommend every non-muslim read this book, to see for themselves what it contains. Compare it to The Bible, the Torah, then come to your own conclusions."
2,The New Amiga 500!,"Apple has finally done it. I hope they are successful in converting throngs of PC users.$599.00 is still a little steep in price.An XBox is just as capable and way less in price.256MB of ram is the new bottom end. These days you need 512mb to really multitask effectively.It's a great start but who exaclty are purchasing the unit? Current Mac owners or PC converts? My suspicion is that a large percentage are current MAC owners looking for a smaller footprint.I'll wait till the hype dies down and buy one when the hype prices come down. Oh wait, Apple doesn't have sales, My bag."
1,Bad Apple Service,"I bought my Mac mini from Apple Webstore in HK. After I received my Mac mini, first time I booted it, failed in registered stage. Second time, I re-booted it, it can't work. I sent to Apple repair center, they told me HD failed. BUT they don't have any HD can replace. I called several times to HK and China Apple Service Center, they told me wait wait wait .....Be careful, I bought some extra memory, wireless, bluetooh for my Mac mini. I doubt the installation quality of Apple."
3,Was hoping for a little more,"The name ""Jane Austen"" in the title is what attracted me to this book. However, it is basically a Romance novel without anything very interesting about Jane in it. Mysterious time travel can make for some interesting set ups - like modern people trying to fit in (or not) in the past. But this book didn't add anything interesting to that concept either. It is an OK book to pass the time with, but you won't remember it afterwards."
3,"Predictable and self-indulgent, but fun","This book is predictable (even with the ""twists""), but enjoyable as long as you take it for what it is and don't try to be too serious about it. I found the author to be very self-indulgent, but I don't think she pretended to be anything else."
4,Good Read!,"This is a fun read. I enjoy Time-travel fiction as you are wondering all through the book, ""Will he get back?"" Of course, there is no Time-travel book as good as ""Time and Again,"" but this one is very enjoyable and it's fun to ""meet"" Jane Austen!"
2,Too simplistic,"I hate writing negative reviews because I know how much work went into publishing the work, but... This work is sub-par, and I believe the author could do better. I like the idea of a modern retelling of the original story, which is what I thought this would be, and I even liked the time-travel twist for the most part. Unfortunately, the writing itself was too simplistic for an Austen-inspired story. Better writing, more along the style of Austen herself, would have added to the integrity and credence of the story. However, if you're stuck in a car and looking for meager escapist literature, you may enjoy this book. Just get it from the library."
3,Good if you are in the mood to watch a movie like The Love Letter,This is the kind of book to read if you were in the mood to watch a movie like The Love Letter or You've Got Mail but there was a big thunderstorm and the lights went out or you are getting over the flu and you can't process a complicated plot line but are getting bored of just watching TV. It is what it is and it was an enjoyable.
1,Terrible,"This book was not at all what I expected. The book was complete drivel, and more than a few hours of wasted time that I will not get back. Jane Austen and time travel through portals? Why not just watch ""Kate and Leopold""? The author clearly has no respect for the Jane Austen canon."
3,A Wrong-headed View of the Future,"I loved this book, except for a rather heavy-handed attempt to link birth control and sexual freedom to the wonderful world of the twenty-first century. Hasn't the author ever looked at a modern classroom or a day-care center or the whole foster-care system? Haven't the readers noticed how many college girls go to bars, leave with someone they hardly know, and end up dead?Instead of sexual freedom bringing in the modern Utopia, it has delivered one or two generations with untold numbers of lost souls. Any day you want, I'll be happy to take Jane's morals and values--the family, fidelity, chastity, children who know their fathers, young women who accept the protection of their families."
5,No more sharp fence posts,"I have a 3 foot fence in my backyard where my kids play. The t-posts are somewhat sharp and rusty on top. I don't want them to get unnecessarily scraped up. And I really don't want them getting tetanus. So I put these nice vinyl caps on all the posts. They are easy to install and offer adequate protection. Of course, my kids can still find plenty of ways to hurt themselves, but sharp rusty fence posts doesn't have to be one of them.The product description doesn't say what sizes of t-posts will work with these caps. Given the low price, I took a chance and ordered a pack. According to the package, it fits all sizes of t-posts. I believe it. My posts are supposedly 1.25 lbs./foot, but my scale says they range from 1.00 to 1.40. The caps fit them all perfectly."
1,about fifty 10-second low-budget loops. FAIL.,"This is merely a data DVD with about fifty SHORT (about ten second)loops of low-tech backgrounds. All are .mov files.It reminds me of that AcidWarp program from 1996, which was cool for 1996 but not 2008. If you want sweet visuals for a party, go with VJWorld ""Revolutions"" DVD, but not this one. I don't know why this is $25.00 when it is only a small sampler of uncompelling visuals. You can find similar free loops on vj forums online. Skip this one. I feel gypped."
3,entertaining fantasy,"The second book in a trilogy, The Golden Horn finds Alfred, elf and priest, in Byzantium during the Fourth Crusade and the sack of Constantinople, c. 1203 [the ""Golden Horn"" of the title -- named for its shape and its famed wealth]. Alfred begins to reconcile body and mind, and continues to grow as a person, while questioning his own and his Kinsmen's part in his religion. After reading The Isle of Glass, I found the Golden Horn something of a disappointment. Everything about it seemed rushed, unfinished. The writing is only a little better than average for a fantasy novel, and I craved more of the rich characterization and dialogue that I found in the first book. Still, entertaining enough."
5,Perfect,"This was the perfect guitar to give to my daughter. I was completely surprised at the quality of this guitar. The amp was not that great, but still perfect for what I wanted. This is the perfect starter guitar for anyone. I highly recommend it. The sound is great, stays in tune. It's great. It looks much better than in the picture too."
3,"Professionally written, adequately entertaining.","I'm aware that I'm damning the book with faint praise, but that's the best summary title I can think of. A noir thriller centering around an ex-dealer who wants to do right, his deadly ex-wife, and a straight arrow cop. There's nothing really special about the book, and the noir language is so self-conscious it's occasionally very funny. Read if bored, skip if something better is available."
3,2 1/2* Not His Best,"After reading the mostly excellent ""Flinch,"" I turned to Robert Ferrigno's heralded debut novel and was very disappointed. Unlike ""Flinch,"" the plot is sometimes unclear, he relies on clumsy stereotypes, and motivation is not always believable.Ferrigno throws in so many contrived oddball situations that it's almost like he doesn't really believe in the strength of the story itself. While humorous exaggeration is common to mysteries, Ferrigno doesn't balance this with enough realism to make this a credible story, and this lessens our involvement.There are some good scenes (especially with the jocular but intimidating ""Cubanito""), clever dialogue, and genuine suspense (along with his usual graphic violence), but the book does not compare to his later efforts. Recommended only for completists who want to read all of his work."
3,Ferrigno's first - 3.5 stars,"I think it's his first. It made quite a splash when it first came out. I didn't like it at the time but have just reread and revised my opinion. My hardback has praise from Elmore Leonard and Amy Tan. Quite a combo. It has all the trademarks of a Robert Ferrigno crime novel. Wry dialogue, cartoonish but engaging situations, oddball bad guys - McFestus enjoyed. There's really alot going on and Ferrigno keeps things moving (physically and emotionally).In order to keep track of this novel vs the other Ferrigno novels - this one has the recurring characters Det Jane Holt, soon to be retired Det Karl Steiner, the hyperkinetic drug dealer Cubanito and some wired teen with computer skills. Retired drug dealer Danny De something or other gets involved in the case of a mutilated dead body found hanging at his ex-wife's apartment. Danny stirs the interest of the detectives as he tries to re-enter the small time marijuana dealer world he swore to leave. Many affecting moments."
3,OUTRAGEOUS.,"A powerful debut which portrays the colorful life of a South L.A. retired drug dealer who when accused of the murder of his disappeared ex-wife, sets off to find the truth; a journey through Newport's vile underworld."
4,"Wow! Great story line, difficult to close",Danny DeMedici's life is entangled in his ex-wife's web of sex and industrial politics with a dash of manufactured drugs. A story line that draws you on to the damaged end as Danny seeks to understand the messages left for him in ancient South American rituals. This character provides the basis for more fiction around Danny's skills. A great read
4,Surprisingly good read!,"In helping his ex-wife steer clear of a murder rap, he becomes involved with a few detectives, his bizarre ex brother in-law, a couple of muscle bound freaks (Baby Hueys!), a ""mad"" scientist and other assorted characters. Not entirely predictable and fast paced enough to keep me reading!!I like the way Ferrigno pieces a story together. It wasn't difficult to recall characters, great descriptive work and good storytelling."
5,Daily Thoughts,"""Prayers And Devotions"" is a collection of writings and speeches, written or spoken, by Pope John Paul The Great. There is one for each day of the year, with additional sections for movable feasts. The selections are about 1 page each, more or less. Some are geared to the particular feast being celebrated, some to the season and others just to things important enough to be thought about. Each one is interesting and worth reading.I spent a whole year reading this book and it was a treat every day. Each day I was provided with thoughts worth thinking and inspiring insights. I expect that I will read it again during some future year and may refer to it on specific dates or when I just need a boost. Make it your daily companion too!"
4,"Great Symphonic Metal, but...","Ji-in Cho's vocals may not be as strong as Tarja Turunen (ex-Nightwish) or Sharon Den Adel, but her energy and the music composition make up for it. Bloodangel's Cry remains, for me, their best release. Stand-out tracks include ""The Promise,"" ""Lost,"" ""Out of Tears,"" ""Scream,"" ""Time to Bring the Pain,"" and ""All Systems Go,"" but there are no filler tracks on this album and all songs are worth listening to and add to the atmosphere. The choirs add depth to the songs, though without them, I don't think Krypteria would sound nearly as wonderful. There is a lack of fullness in the orchestra, though I can't exactly pinpoint the issue. I wanted to give this 4.5 stars, but I settled for a 4 instead of 5 because there is better symphonic metal out there, though you can't go wrong with this album."
3,Good selection,"Gothic metal done well. I enjoy the sound of her voice. Memorable songs. Great sound.Whole album has an ""I have been hurt by a lover"" kinda feel, which could strike a cord with a lot of people. Lyrics do a good job of conveying her feelings.Good stuff!"
5,Profound Commentary from the Archbishop of Canterbury,"This is one of the best commentaries I have found on the Gospel of John. William Temple was the Archbishop of Canterbury during World War II. His explanations of Jesus' teaching in this gospel are very moving, clear, and more profound than I have read before. The well known passages of John 3, 17, 19 were presented in an intensely clear way drawing from allusions that are more culturally common today, and in it he explains the significance of the imagery that Jesus drew upon to those in his Jewish homeland."
2,packing,"Its just a packet of three undies, but it was packed in a ridiculously huge box and with ""balloon protector"".Because of that, I was made to pay a huge sum for shipping from US to my home country! Please use common sense, it is NOT a fragile item, just a normal plastic envelope will do!"
4,The connection to Nestor and Small One,"There has been some controversy in specials that contain a Christmas donkey. The little Brown Burro, Nestor the long-eared Christmas donkey, and The Small One. The other two add up in this third film I recently discovered from online. I have been trying to re-write Nestor, and searched for inspiration. With the right contracts from Disney and Rankin/Bass and this open source (hoping) story I will re-write the stories together and make an awesome book or film."
3,"Cheap construction, but it gets the job done","These Elenco cables get the job done, but the banana connector (and cable in general) feels very cheap. This is the kind of cable that works great if you're new to digital multimeters and electronic equipment (and/or want to spend very little on equipment), but if you're like me and hate having to replace a low-grade product soon after purchase with something better (and subsequently being stuck with a now useless low-end product) do yourself a favor and pick a higher quality of cable."
1,Border on useless,"It's not terribly obvious from the pictures, but these leads, unlike every other banana lead, do not allow you to plug multiple cables into each other. I admit I don't have years and years of working with this stuff under my belt, but I have still never seen banana jacks where you can't plug other banana jacks into the back of them. Pass these over."
5,A Beautiful Book;A Wonderful Writer,"I picked this book up randomly at the book store. What made me buy it was the New York Times Book Review's statement, ""Occationally a scene comes across as so elegantly rounded and complete I admit to gasping from sheer pleasure."" This kind of reaction from a person who reads books for a living pursuaded me to give it a try. I was not disappointed. Spencer's writing style is so smooth that I found myself aching inside for Fielding Pierce. I'm not going to tell you what happens because that is part of the beauty of the book. You are better off not knowing the details. Just buy the book, sit back, and prepare to be engrossed by woderfully developed characters that transcend the novel. You actually end up seeing them as real people, who you accept with all their faults and gifts. Scott Spencer earned himself a new fan with this novel."
1,"Never received it, to this day.","I have ordered from the co. before and forgot they were the only ones that took a month to get the book to me. I ordered 5 or 6 books from different companies the same day and received them all within days, except for this co. They blame it all the the P.O. but all the other companies are getting their used books to the buyer."
2,Disappointed,"Due to many positve reviews, I started this novel with high expectations. Unfortunately it left me unsatisfied. Previously I've enjoyed Scott Spencer's books, but this time I never connected with the characters. There was little to no suspense, and the ending was predictable."
5,A good referance to anyone considering the breed,"I'm considering getting a dog and all the long-haired breeds really appealed to me- especially the Lhas Apso. I got the book to find out more about them and I learned a lot. The book includes everythig you need to know about Lhasa Apsos, from housbreaking to Health care, from behavior to breeding. The pictures are adorable, and the text is informative. I loved this book and any other dog-lover will too."
5,Perfect,I bought this for my 2004 Kia Optima. It works really well and for a great price. It fits on the door when pumping gas and is not difficult to remove like some of those other cheaper brands.
3,Disappointed,"I picked this book up at the library because it had an interesting look to it. It is unusually designed and weirdly illustrated. It's great to have all these wonderful prefaces in one handy volume, but Gray, who supplies an introduction and many of the glosses, writes in a kind of shorthand, staccato style that is unpleasant, and he has weak control of comma usage. I might have bought this book except for Gray's writing style."
2,Interesting unsupported opinions,"This book is a quick read and does provide a quick outline about stereotypical Japanese beliefs and behaviours, as well as some interesting insights into Japanese culture. Unfortunately it does little to support them. Time and time again the author says something interesting about Japan, but fails to give an example or statistic to back it up. The result is that this appears to be a collection of one man's opinions, but gives no basis for believing them.Let me give you an example ""It has long been symptomatic for the Japanese to blame others for their problems..."" Really? So what? Give us an example! Prove it to us! Unfortunately he fails to do so.Very frustrating because he does have some interesting things to say."
2,"it,s ok","I was not thrilled with it, I do like her singing but this dvd was disapointing. Watch her video,s on U Tube if you want to see her.The cd of her greastest hits is worth the money.Frank"
4,Diana Krall rules,"Vegas is ok, but I'm always comparing to Live in Paris, which is the ultimate cd and dvd.I just enjoy all her work."
1,NO POSSIBLE REVIEW,THIS GOOD DIDIN`T COME YET. PLEASE SEND-ME A MESSAGE ABOUT POSTAGE AND HOW TOGE INFORMATIONS ABOUT WHEN IT IS GONNA BE QAVAILABLE IN MY HOUSE. I AM WORRIED ABOUT.
5,diana is incredible,"great dvd, diana is incredible, only wish i could have it on cd too....so i can listen on the long car rides"
2,my only disappointment,"This is the only album of Diana Krall's , and I have them all, that is a disapointment. I do not have words to discribe the magic of her live performances including a personal presents at a preformance in Las Vegas Hiltons concert hall . This album lacks that magic , maybe one too many , maybe RIO ."
1,I do not recommend this book...,"Before going on my trip to Rio, I decided to purchase 3 guide books rather than relying on just one. And what a great decision that was! Had I relied on just Lonely Planet's Rio guide, I would have been as hopeless as a lost puppy. Most of the information in this book are outdated or plain incorrect. Important areas such as music, nightlife, etc. were neglected and many recommendations such as those for lodging & dining were off. My suggestion is that one should definitely look for alternatives to this guide as my copy is awaiting a more useful future near a recycling plant on outskirts of Rio.Of the 3 guides that I purchased, I found Rio for Parties the most useful. An excellent guide aimed for the young or the young at heart."
1,Lonely Planet is Out!,"I dont recommend this book, most of the informations are inaccurated. Rio has an extensive options that are not described on that book. Unfortunately I have spent three days to discover an excelent visual travel guide called Rio for Partiers. Expensive than Lonely Planet, it's true, but all the informations you have to know is there. By The Way I could save a lot of money using the discounts and bonuses!"
2,gives me the yawns,"Not enough information about the popular culture or nightlife to really absorb the lifestyle of Cariocas. For such a complex and exciting city, this book offers basic, conventional information, some of which is out dated and few photos or illustrations. ...This book gives me the yawns. I recommend Rio for Partiers (even if you are not twenty-something)to get excited about traveling to Rio de Janeiro, one of the most gifted cities in the world."
3,Hard to put top bag on,"I have had my 1100 for a couple of years now. Hopefully by now they have upgraded the piece of junk strap that holds the top bag on. There has GOT to be a better way! It is next to impossible to connect tightly. I find myself not using it sometimes just to keep from filling it and having to deal with the strap... Not the situation I had envisioned when I bought it. If you have a suggestion for upgrading that part of it, let me know!Collects sawdust nicely, isn't all that loud (much quieter than a shopvac!) Setup was easy enough. Not as pleased as I would like to be, but it does it's job."
3,"Easy assembly, not so quiet","The DC-1100A is very easy to assemble, taking only an hour if you get the two or three wrenches and screw driver out before trying to begin and don't hurry. The Tool Crib catalogue advertisement touts quiet operation. I would call it rather loud, but have no basis for comparison with other makes of similar machines. The machine rolls from place to place on its wheels with only a light touch which is good, and it does a thorough job of collecting dust and chips from my surface planer."
5,dust it up,i got it for xmas 2006 great machine hooked it up to 56 ftof duct for duct sucks go keeps up with my shaper great suck 95% of the chips/ duct nice not to to noise love this machine
5,Real Tactical Flashlight,"This is a true tactical flashlight which gives you three settings depending on your requirement. At the lowest setting this light is the most powerful flashlight I've owned. The smaller, low battery drain bulbs(3 or 6 burn setting) shoot powerful ""blue"" light like a science fiction laser ray gun. I use mine to walk my dog in evening. This torch really gets people' attention. Due to it's heavy duty construction it's a bit on the heavy side. But then this thing is sturdy enough to double as a small baton."
5,Work with this. You'll love it.,"This is my first flashlight. The reason i chose this is because it has a combination of both LED n Xenon, for close n far view respectively. I use it for my work in the aviation industry. Just by the 6 LEDs alone enable me to carry out my inspections that is about 20feet away. Needless to say about the Xenon bulb. ;)Two cons about this flashlight are it is a little heavy as it hold 3 C-size batts and the focus beam does not seem to achieve the standard that i want.Overall, this is great stuff!!!"
2,Disappointed in output,This light is build very well but the output is disappointing at best. LED out is quite blue in color and not very bright by todays standards. The xenon is also dim and not focused. Not useful outdoors as light output does not project well at all. Looking for a CREE or K2 mod.
1,ONE SORRY EXPERIENCE,"yesterday i recieved the second c90b. 8-10-09. first ordered 6-16-09. first order, too long getting it. defective. returned. terrible getting help from allergy begone on phone. second one works, but does nothing. not what i exspected or wanted. look's like a piece of junk. left on a full 24 hours, and nothing on collect plates at all. cant believe FRIEDRICH, put there name on this product. may write letter to them. useless, and i paid 400 bucks, unbelieveable."
2,Don't buy this unless you feel like taking out a mortgage on filter replacements,"This item works well if it is in the direct air flow of the house. Aside from that, if you want to pay about $70 every few months to replace filters, then get it . . . when I purchased this originally the replacement filters were cheaper (at least that's how I remember it). Look them up now . . . just type ""friedrich filter"" into the search and look at the carbon filter and the prefilter if you don't believe me.I have a whirlpool (I think) that cost me like $200 and it works just as good . The filters are significantly cheaper too.I wouldn't purchase this again . . . I wish I didn't in the first place. 3 times replacing the filters and I could buy a whole new unit of a different brand."
5,Running 24/7 with no problem for 8yrs! Great air cleaner!,"I bought C90 in October 2002 and it's still running strong after 8 years of almost around the clock use. I have two main filter elements and I rotate them -- one is used in C90 while the second one stays soaked in soap water until the filters are swapped, monthly. I'm very pleased that the electric motor and the precipitation circuit keep working like new for this long. Though it was pricey, I think I got my money back with many years of non-stop use. I'm extremely happy with this unit."
4,Remember his performances,"If you are a fan of John Denver this DVD set is a must own for you. The 1st DVD, a concert from Australia in 1977 is the best for me. He is performing with an orchestra conducted by Lee Holdridge. The performance is from the same year I first saw Denver and it is wonderful. His rich voice and the soaring arrangements are beautiful. The other DVDs present Denver with smaller band and solo performance settings and still show what a tremendous and sincere performer he was."
5,Best compilation,"This is by far, the best video compilation of his major concerts;expensive but you do get your money's worth!"
2,Poor Film Quality,"I love John Denver and I had high hopes to see this DVD. I thought the filming quality was poor. Usually, they can ""dress up""these older VHS remakes but it was like they just copied a VHS into the DVD format with no enhancements.Another thing, on Disc 1 , it froze up 3/4 of the way through and I have a state of the art set up so you can't blame it on the machine"
1,Missing songs,"The Australian show is missing songs from the original broadcast, most noteably ""Thirtsy Boots"", one of the most beautiful songs John has performed. The song was written by Denver's favorite singer/songwriter of the 1960s, Eric Anderson, yet it was left off of this DVD...Why? This is the only known live recording on DVD of this song, yet it was omitted. Sound mixing is also poor, the VHS copy I have of this show has a much better sound mix. The other shows in this collection do not hold a candle to the 1977 Australian show, thus I am putting most of the weight from my reveiw into that show. The song omissions and mixing make this release a dissapointment for me."
4,A great picture,"This television really does have a superior picture to most of what's out there. (unless you step up to a good quality plasma screen). The only issue I've had is with one corner of the set that gets some weird colors once in awhile. From what I was told, this occurs because of the sensitivity of the set to the magnetic north and that if I turned the set, the problem would likely go away. Besides that, dvds look perfect, and playstation 2 games are great looking on this set."
5,"Perfect form-factor, works well","I love this little mouse because I can store it inside the laptop and never forget it. Battery life has never failed me (lasts much longer than the laptop battery), and it works reliably. I hope they someday make a unit with a laser pointer built in, and this will be my perfect presentation tool!"
4,Great Flashlight,"The light has a decent throw, it has as spot of about 10 ft around at 50 ft. After 50 ft the led just doesn't give alot of light. The Luxeon LED falls about halfway between a high powered Xenon and a regular LED. It still has a little bit of blue mudiness in the light. A little clunky with the 3AA length. If you buy it for the battery saving capabilities, then you have the right flashlight. If you need perfect white, and distance, go with a Xenon. This light is perfect for any close-range use, indoor use, camping, etc. I would buy another one."
2,Not as bright as Junior,"Once the Streamlight Junior started showing up in my shop, I was amazed at how much brighter it was than my old 3-AA Luxeon Tasklight. Then I read that the Tasklight had been updated with the C4 bulb, and it is supposed to be almost twice as bright as the Junior (95 lumens to 55 lumens), I had to update. I was surprised that the new C4 Tasklight was way dimmer than the new Junior. After reading some reviews, I found that I could install the old lens from my Luxeon Tasklight, and it improved the brightness and spot light quality to almost as good as the Junior. I E-Mailed Streamlight twice, with no response. Until they work this out, the Junior is a better value."
2,"Great flashlight, but corrodes internally","I also had a problem with this flashlight corroding inside. In fact, I had this 3-AA model as well as a Maglite 3-AA model, and both are now useless as the batteries completely corroded and sealed themselves inside. I have numerous 2-AA Maglites as well as other brands, and never had such a problem, only with the 3-AA models. I only kept and used them indoors, and so I'm convinced it has nothing to do with outside elements. Both this and the Maglite I used a handful of times, maybe 10 times over a period of around 6 months, and kept them in a drawer, and now useless. I'm led to believe there is something not quite right with the 3-AA models. Though with millions out there, that would likely be tough to prove. Just wanted to share my very disappointing experience, as I had very high hopes for this light, I liked everything else about it."
4,excellent puzzles,"Imagination in Chess presents over 700 really tricky puzzles. These are difficult and not for the beginner. i believe that they are worth the effort, allowing an improvement in chess calculations. It is an excellent book. My only complaint is that the main line is shown in BOLD with multiple interruptions. This is an unusual presentation that sometimes makes it hard to follow."
2,Not the original version,This is NOT original the version from the Chess Record album pictured. It's mostly guitar rather than the original trio and a poor recording. Should have previewed it first...
3,Not for my taste,"This particular CD sounds like cocktail lounge music. The version I heard and wanted had a heavy drum and bass. This is pleasant music but I like the more jazzy sound, evidently this trio was without drums. I'm ordering the CD ""Live 1956"" with the prominant drum and bass."
3,Interesting but has Lazy Editing Syndrome,"Plutarch was a Greek historian who wrote in the 2nd Century AD. This work covers the lives of six key individuals in the twilight of the old Roman Republic from 105-43 BC. Marius and Sulla were soldier-dictators who first sought to gain one-man rule. They were followed by Crassus, Pompey and Caesar. These three lives are the best in the book. The final life is Cicero, the lawyer. There is good military detail on Marius' defeat of the Cimbri, Crassus' defeat at Carrhae and Caesar's triumph at Pharsalus. The Mithraditic Wars in Asia minor are important but difficult to follow due to the lack of any maps. There are no great lessons here, other than the eternal struggle for power. The editor was lazy in this book and should have provided a glossary of key individuals, since there are too many individuals with similar names. There are also no maps - a major flaw."
2,very disappointed.,"After using this blade i'am very disappointed with the results that it produced. I used it to rip 3/4"" poplar and it left more saw marks than the previous fine tooth blade i was using. I don't know if it was ground wrong or what, but i was very unhappy with the results of this blade after reading what a smooth surface it was supposed to leave. Sorry i wasted my money on it."
4,Excellent ripping blade,"I just purchased this blade to use on my tablesaw. I have been ripping four inch thick mahogany boards on this saw for a number of years using cross cut blades and cutting one way through the board and then flipping the board over and cutting the other half. Needless to say it was difficult and always took a long time. I just tried this blade cutting the same type of wood and it was a pleasure to use. It had no trouble cutting through the four inch board, leaving just a little line where the two cuts came together. I can highly recommend this blade for ripping hard woods like mahogany. I have also ripped two inch think birch boards and had no trouble doing that"
3,Glue line rip blade,"I have several other Freud blades. I especially like their ""laminate & plywood"" blade. It makes very clean cuts through melamine and plywood with no fuzz or chipping. Their other model blades do a fine job. But this ""glue line"" blade doesn't do as well. I run a small cabinet shop and cut mostly hardwoods on cabinet saws. Somehow, I think this blade should do a better job. This blade just feels dull, it pulls down the saw speed significantly and leaves kerf marks on both sides of cut. Next ripping blade I'll try a CMT."
5,Wasn't excited at first but now...,I love it!!! Once you get used to this blade you can't live without it. It does a great job of ripping boards and I don't know what the other guy is talking about with the problem with hardwoods. I use 8/4 cherry frequently and it rips right through it. Overall a great investment and a great alternative to a jointer if you don't have the funds for a high end model.
3,Permashield?,"First of all I'll admit I didn't read the fine print. This blade will only produce glue line rips in material up to 1"". I tried it in 1 1/2"" oak and got saw marks and yes, my Unisaw is well tuned. The biggest concern for me though is the ""permashield"". I cleaned the blade with some CMT pitch cleaner and got a red towel when I wiped the product off. Bare metal was showing through in spots. Doesn't sound too ""perma"" does it?"
2,Disappointed,"From all the hype about how great this blade is supposed to be, I was really disappointed when I started to use it. This is a relatively expensive blade and does not perform as advertised. I tried it out on a project I was working on in cherry and tried to rip a piece. The resulting cut was far from smooth. It left ridges and will require sanding. It does not perform any better than a less expensive combination blade."
4,The smaller tooth comb is great,"The smaller tooth comb is great for combing out anything that gets stuck in your dogs hair. Although, I haven't found any use for the larger one. The case is cute and compact!"
5,Great for years!,"I've rarely used this for fleas - we have meds to prevent that - but it's amazing for removing loose fur from both my British Shorthair cat and my Pit-Viszla dog. Pi, the dog, doesn't much enjoy it, but Mack the Cat loves it, and it keeps his hairballs to a minimum if used at least every other day. Doesn't seem to irritate either pet's skin. Easily washed."
3,works but....,"I have a couple of flea combs and have my favorite, this one is okay but there's better ones out there, in my opinion."
3,"It's not bad, it's just not as good as the first","It's not a bad movie, but needs more kong screentime. Also,if kong were to stand more like an ape then a human (as the suit actor wanted, but the direactor said no), then he would be alot more realistic. still, its not as good as the first or Peter Jackson's, but its worth the 10 bucks."
2,Awful... just plain awful!,"This was a god horrible remake of the original King Kong. The native dance sequence was the only part that I liked, but the whole sexual attraction thing between big black kong and white damsel Lange played out like some interracial/beastiality porn flick. I was just waiting for him to pull out a king-sized latex & try to get some. The ice skating sequence was crappy and Jeff Bridges' performance was just cheesy."
1,If you own the previous dvd edition DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS,"Paramount deserves to be struck across the face for putting this out without ANYTHING NEW. It is the same as the previous release. No remaster, no commentary, none of the extra footage sought for years. This is nothing but a bulls__t release meant to capitalize on Jackson's film - and they've f____d up big time. No brains at Paramount it seems."
4,REMAKE BETTER THAN REPUTATION,"Although most critics dissected the remake of KING KONG, I cannot help finding this picture a bizarre love story between ""the beauty and the beast"". It doesn`t have action of the original, but it is a beautiful photographed fable..."
3,jessica lange vs big monkey,"this is what it is. although there could be more special effects, the movie is a good one to have in your collection."
3,"Not the original, but worthwhile entertainment","I am a big fan of the 1933 version as well, but the 70's version does an admirable job of putting a great story in a modern light.Kong was a little too human for me compared to the original, but the 2nd version just has an appeal that's hard to describe. The DVD cover immediately reminded me of all the fast food posters back in the 70's as this movie was very popular when it was released. It remained popular in theaters and drive-ins for several years, with reason."
4,Good Retelling of the 1933 Classic,"I first saw this movie when I was 8 years old and was blown away by it. I hadn't seen the original at the time, but since then I have. I love both of them. Although this version is somewhat dated by Jessica Lange's spacey performance, the film still survives on it's immpressive special effects, witty and fast paced screenplay, and an amazing score by John Barry. It may not have the magic of the original, but on it's own merit, this film is classic of it's genre."
2,Pales beside the '33 original,"Like most remakes, the film exhibits good intentions and even starts off well. However, its fundamental production quality and even its special effects (!) are dwarfed by those of the 1933 original. The acting in the 1933 film is also much more convincing, in my opinion. I formerly owned the LaserDisc issue of the 1933 King Kong, and that edition was terrific, featuring the movie in its _unedited_ version as well as a director's commentary pertaining to the detailed aspects of the making of this great film.I suggest that you _skip_ this mediocre remake and save your hard-earned bucks to purchase the upcoming DVD version of the original King Kong. If it is anything like the LaserDisc version (it actually should be more, regarding ""extras""), you won't go wrong!"
2,STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL!!,"The thinking behind this remake escapes me. Why redo a nearly perfect movie, and leave out the dinosaurs? There is one encounter with a giant snake that's not bad, but that's it. The first half of this movie is an acceptable adventure story, but after Kong is captured, it goes downhill, becoming a politically correct monster movie(ie, Jeff Bridges cheers Kong as he defeats the military). Just stick with the 1933 movie, perfect in every way, almost, and keep hoping they find the lost footage of the spiders at the bottom of that ravine!!"
3,Almost a good movie,"Again, I do not understand why you force me to write ""War and Peace"" type reviews for a product.A few well chosen words should suffice, don't you think???"
3,"An Updated Remake, for 1976...","I used to see this movie all the time and loved it, especially with Kong wrecking the city. But compared to the origional, the sexuality in this movie is pretty blatant. In '33 Kong tears off Fay Wrays clothes in a playfull manner. In this version he smiles as he peel's of Jessica Langes top! The SPFX were good for the time. Even though some people think Kong was played totally by a giant animatronic ape, it was only used for 3 scenes in the movie. But the Kong suit created by Rick Baker and Carlo Rambaldi is one of the best things about it."
4,Classic Kong,"I remember my dad taking me to see this when I was 9 years old at the time. I also remember King Kong being really popular. Like everything else during that time, it was heavely marketed. I even had a pj's with the classic scene of Kong on the twin towers on them. All in all, it was a good movie, not great. I liked it. The only thing that I hated about the movie was its really sad ending. I could have done without that, but I guess it had to be."
4,"Not the original, but also not unbearable","I didn't hate this movie. For what it's worth, it's a good movie; the main thing that was different was the absence of the dinosaurs. Overall I think this movie is way underrated and a lot of people call it bad just because that's the popular thing to call it. No, this is not as good as the original; it's also not the worst movie to ever be created. Kong himself looked pretty good and the special fx were terrific. While not the best, it is far from the worst"
3,jessica lange--i'm dizzy,Just saw this the other day on HBO. Like everyone else said this flick is dripping with cheese all the way round. Charles Grodin is hilarious. the bit parts sucked and jeff bridges--how come everyone shaves except him. But the real treat was Jessica Lange. Wow. I can't believe I was staring bug-eyed at the TV watching Jessica Lange act in a movie released the year before i was BORN. Why she won an emmy for such a debut performance i'll never know--she doesn't speak complete sentences through half the movie. But there's no question--she used to be HOT.
1,Man in cheap ape suite behind blue screen,"This movie was total garbage. Annoying enviro wacko themes and unneccesary anti military scenes, Jeff Bridges character cheering on Kong as he attacks the military.Shows the fool De Laurentis is since Merian C Cooper was a WW1 veteran and a blue blood American and helped create the original 1933 Kong.This movie inslults him as well as his work on KK 1933.Movie shows viewer it was made on the cheap. Jungle is NOT convincing. Looks like the fake jungles from soap operas. No other creatures except a rubber snake.You could see the seams in KK's costume.Bad effects + annoying characters + anti capitalist/anti military themes =BOMB."
1,What was the budget for the gorilla costume????,"Why on earth would actors of the calibur of Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges agree to this poorly conceived remake of a classic. Enough close-ups of anguished faces. Jessica looks great, too bad it's such a waste. Jeff should never have made a movie with that scuffy growth on his face and the long hair. I could go on but I have better things to do. I want you to know that I only saw the last 15"" of this film. But that was more than enough."
1,Story Embraces destruction of an Animal.,"Regardless of what people think, this story is a sad story.I don't like the ending nor anything at all about King Kong or any other version that exists out there. King Kong should have taken the Woman with him, back to that island that he was from. You see the prejudices of the human anglo race toward this giant Ape. This is like gloryfing the destruction of an animal! People like to show off that 70's were great but indeed the 70's were racist time and the message here is one of killing an Ape, even though it is a movie, but destorying an ape is the message here. Even though the movie is just a movie, i don't feel right about that, the stupid writer should have written a better plot or ending for the animal as compared to its total destruction. Anyone enjoying this movie is one thing: An idiot( man or woman.)"
1,This is a joke. Isn't it?,"If a re-make is attempted then surely the idea is to make it better than the original. But this is not a patch on the 1933 version. The great ape is just a man in a suit here. The animatronic model ape looks nothing like the suit version, and perhas it's a blessing that it's only on-screen for a matter of seconds. And where are the dinosaurs? The only monster Kong gets to fight in this film is what seems to be an outsize draught excluder. Have special effects regressed since 1933? There are some memorable moments, but they're mainly due to the excellent scenery and haunting soundtrack. They're certainly not due to the Fay Wray wanna-be cuddling a giant rubber finger. The Son of Kong was better than this tame disapointment. I'd give this two stars for having a good soundtrack but it's better to ignore this dross and buy the score on its own on CD."
2,"Not A Patch On The 1933 Classic, They Should Have Called This Kink Konk","Oh my gosh, what a mess this movie is, where are the dinosaurs? all you get is a fake looking snake and that's it.The acting is so bad it looks like they cast from a tv soap, and as for the effects, Kong looks more camp than scary, the only scenes that actually work are the scenes with the natives early in the film , put this up against the 1933 classic and see which one shines, I have this film in my collection but I find it very hard to sit through and not cringe.A cringe classic maybe but not a classic in a good way.Buy The original and see real kong fury."
4,"CORRECTION OF ""A Great, Misunderstood Pop Classic""","And I quote: 'It cost $24 million and made $60 in 1977 dollars, only a little less than the highly regarded blockbuster ""Jaws.""'KING KONGUSA Box Office: $53 MillionWorldwide Box Office: $80 MillionBudget Estimate: $24 MillionJAWSUSA Box Office: $260 MillionWorldwide Box Office: $471 MillionBudget Estimate: $12 Million"
4,King Kong 1976 movie is on point!,"The movie was all good. When i watch the new one in 2006, it was kind of different from the origanal on in the 1930's and the one i saw again yesterday on amazon on demand. King Kong 1976 is on point from back in the day. Gotta give this movie a play. Thanks.De'Vear Smallaka Dee SmallsDecatur GA"
3,"""Hey Jack, I'm a star!"" -Jessica Lange","Jessica Lange is introduced to the world in this big budget 70's remake of King Kong. The music entices you as Jack and a group of money hungry crewmates set out to discover oil on a mysterious island which holds even bigger secrets. Lange portrays Dwan, a blond aspiring star set out to become famous. She is kidnapped by the island natives and placed into the hands of King Kong. There are very clever special effects throughout. Kong is taken to New York city, and sets himself loose during a ceremony. Kong recaptures Dwan and takes her atop the World Trade Centers new Twin Towers. It is sad to note what will become of this in the future as you watch Kong climb the towers, and later fall from them. I recommend this movie as the blockbuster it once was."
3,Why did they did this thing?,"Oh please,King Kong is a guy in a gorilla suit.Dino de Laurentis was brave to actually do this.The gorilla suit might have only cost 5$ at the costume store.Thought the movie has the beutifull Jessica Lange in his debut and Jeff Bridges.It was good but could have been alot better.***3 stars out of 5"
3,King Kong (1976),"I do like this film because it is fun and entertaining. But I think that the original 1933 one is much better. This one however has a bit of a modern twist to it, and they do spend a great deal of the time on the island, which has always been my favorite part of the movie."
2,this movie is cheesy,come on king kong is a guy in a gorilla suit you can tell its fake 1933 king kong is way cooler and more specail effects this a peace of junk talking about a wast of time this should be 4$
5,highly entertaining,I'm a fan of monsters and fun and I loved this version of the King Kong story as a boy. I still love it today. It's sweet and funny and charming. It has a great cast and a lovable Kong. It also brought tears to my eyes as a kid. This film will forever have a special place in my heart - and a special place on my DVD shelf next to the original Kong. Thanks Dino Delaurentis!
3,King Kong,"I saw this movie in high school and love it, but it lost it's luster over the years and didn't hold up."
5,Love this movie,"This is the movie I watched growing up, so I love it more than any other movie of King Kong."
4,A Sci-Fi/Fantasy Movie Gem,"I remember seeing this movie in '76 when it first hit theaters. I was amazed and entertained! Many reviewers here have done a very good job of describing the film and why so many people liked (even loved) the movie then and now. I still enjoy it. Kong is menacing yet relatable. Jeff Bridges, Jessica Lange and Charles Grodin are excellent and the special effects are pretty darn good for their time. I've seen Peter Jackson's new version and actually prefer the man in the suit to his CGI Kong. '76 Kong is three dimensional and more ""human"" but also more ""monstrous"". I've long thought that Kong should be bi-pedal and not just a giant version of your garden variety gorilla. This Kong delivers what I want in a sci-fi fantasy; good action, a cool monster, decent acting, good special effects and a satisfying ending! Long live Kong!!!"
2,Why Ruin The Good Things?,"I love King Kong. I Like King Kong, King Kong vs. Godzilla(dispite the ending), and I want to see King Kong Escapes(a movie that's not on amazon but the soundtrack is). When I saw this movie I was bored out of my mind. They did nothing on Skull Island but having a fight with a giant snake for 15 seconds(I'm not joking) and a girl flirting with a gorilla that looks like he just kissed Ethen(a kid at my school and it means the ape looks like wax). The bummer is, there's no dinosaurs or humoungus plane fights! I gave this monstrosity a 2 because one it followsthe origenal plot and two, it's better than King Kong Returns."
2,King Kong '70's version,"Not the greatest when viewing it now. I purchased it because I now have all three versions; the original, the 70's version and the newest CGI version. It brings back a lot of fun memories on earlier acting techniques and I can remember when the special effects of this movie were considered great. I won't leave out the great performance of Charles Grodin in this version. Not Jeff Bridges greatest acting nor the new Jessica Lange but it has sentimental value."
3,KINGKONG 1976,THIS verson is nothing like the original there are no dinosaurs on of the sceans was halareous when KINGKONG therw a women that he thought was the girl he fell in love with .I THOUGHT it was foolish that KONG fel in LOVE with a human hopfully PETERJACKISONS VERSON WILL HAVE DINOSAURS.
3,King Kong (1976) A man dressed in a monkey suit? Hogwash!!!,"When I saw this one in theatres back in 76, word was buzzing that some monkey shots were done by Rick Baker in a suit. But from what I read from local newspaper entertainment reports was that the ape was constructed of concrete and rubber, and costing over 4 million dollars to make, being over 40 ft. tall. And the snake, also constructed, costing somewhere around 1.2 million to make. Check out the end credits and you will see that Kong was ENGINEERED and CONSTRUCTED by Carlo Rambaldi."
1,Poor Picture Quality,"This blu-ray issue is by Universal of Australia. It plays on Region A players. However, the picture qualilty is poor - like watching the film through a blizard."
1,Not worth it whats so ever!,"This movie sucks! The other versons of King Kong are great and classic. But for King Kong (1976) & King Kong Lives, the producers were obviously not thinking straight. I mean King Kong climbs up the National Trade Center rather than the Empire State Building. Jack Driscoll looks like Jesus Crist. Ann's name is Dwan? Carl Denhem dies by getting squshed by King Kong. So no ""The Beauty killed the beast"" unless it was said by someone else!!! So don't give this one a chance but go see the other ones. It's with it :)"
3,"Fun, Ages Well",Still a fun movie to watch. And a reminder how hot Jessica Lange was. The end is surprisingly touching although for me some of the pathos was also probably due to seeing the WTC in it's glory.
1,THE ORIGINAL KONG'S UGLY COUSIN,"Abominable remake of the 1930's classic updated for 70s counter-culture sensibilities. Pales next to the original in every conceivable area--acting, characterization, sets, cinematography, and writing. *Especially* writing, as this has to win the prize for all-time worst dialogue hands down. Even the FX are inferior to the original's, which boasts a far more dynamic and empathetic titular monster and vastly more convincing and exciting action sequences. It's all particularly disappointing considering the talent involved in this picture's creation, produced as it was by Dino de Laurentiis and boasting a cast of Jessica Lange, Charles Grodin, and Jeff Bridges with Rick Baker handling the special effects. But for whatever reason, it just doesn't work. The final product is a trite, brain-numbing and instantly outdated parody of its classic forefather. I'm afraid the best thing about this turkey is how much more it makes you appreciate the original."
1,Wally,"When released in 1933, King Kong was greeted with unprecedented amazement. State-of-the-art visual effects, an entertaining story, and a touching ending combined to bequeath upon this film the coveted label of a ""classic."" It its era -- and, indeed, for decades after -- no monster movie (whether made in the U.S., Japan, or elsewhere) approached the lofty perch of this one. [...]"
2,worth a laugh maybe,"the only reason i didn't give this just one star was because there were some interesting native scenes in the beginning of the film. other than that the effects were awful, the acting was nearly as bad and like i said, it's more laughable than anything else."
1,Total Absolute Junk,"This movie sucks! In this movie, Kong looks horrible, the plot is horrible and the sentimentality wears it down! In the old movie, it was OBVIOUS that we were supposed to feel sorry for Kong, but in this one, we actually have ALL the charecters YELLING at the military and crying to let Kong go! I mean, we see Kong's heart EXPLODE on screen! This film is worse than ""King Kong Escapes!"""
1,Horrible special effects,"It is rare for a major Hollywood production to suck up the special effects, but this one surely does. Released in 1976 and starring multiple famous actors in various stages of their respective careers, this movie all but killed any interest in monster movies until Spielberg released Jurassic Park over a dozen years later. Why was this movie so bad? Multiple reasons. First, the acting is horrible; many of the lines look forced, as if the actors and actress are reading from a script. Second, all the monster scenes look fake. King Kong really looked and moved like a grown man in a costume. And the snake he fights on Skull Island looked like a gigantic puppet. The other special effects were fairly bad too, most noticeably the final fight scene with the helicopters. The copters looked and moved worse than remote control copters; they looked like they were dangling on strings. Overall, a crappy movie."
4,Very Good Version,"This version doesn't have the same charm of the original one in black & white, where Fray Way makes the girl's character who King Kong falls in love.Though she brings the ambitious producing idea of Dino De Laurentis, that built an incredible mechanical giant monkey for part of the scenes, besides the great photograph work shown in the film.It is really an indispensable film.For the fans still remains the expectation by the end of the filmings of the third version of the great monkey saga which is being rotated in New Zealand by the same director of the"" Lord of the Rings "" trilogy, Peter Jackson."
3,"Well...You Got To Admit, At Least They TRIED Real Hard! 3.5","You can tell by watching this movie that the makers intended for it to be a classic. While its not that, its not a necessarily BAD movie...it just you have to be in the right mood to watch and enjoy it. Infact, if you are in the right mood, then its highly enjoyable entertainment!The plot is more realistic than the original and the special effects way better, but something's still missing...like the unmistakable element of fun the that made the original SO DARN GOOD!! This new (relatively speaking) takes itself FAR TOO SERIOUSLY!!! That brings the movie down a great deal, but its still neat to watch how the makers handled things and changed things around a lot.Overall, while it is definitely no match for the original, which is in my opinion the ultimate B-movie classic, its definitely worth seeing...it one of those things you call a ""guilty pleasure""."
3,I Heard The Original Is Much Better!,"One of the top money-makers of the 70's. Producer Dino Delaurentis up-dates the 1933 classic. Jessica Lange's first starring role. Academy Award Nominations: 2, including Best Cinematography, Best Sound. Academy Award: Best Special Effects.I thought KING KONG was a good movie but I heard the original is much better. My favourite parts are when Kong kills people by stepping on them and knocking over subways. This film is a classic.A lot of people hated this remake but I didn't quite mind it. The only time I never liked this was the first time I seen it when I was about twelve-years-old. There's not really much I can say about KING KONG. It's a good movie and that's about it. Even to someone who didn't like it, will still find it watchable.I hope my review was helpful to you!"
2,OK remake.,"Though certainly not up to the level of the 1933 original, this film does have its moments. The spfx are good(excepting the stiff robot Kong used for a few long shots). The giant snake is pretty disappointing, making one long for the original's parade of prehistoric monstrosities. The score is decent, adding much to the proceedings. Unfortunately, the campy attitude exhibited by the filmmakers and played up by the cast nearly sinks the whole film. Gone is the awe and wonder of the original Kong. In its place is a plethora of knowing smirks and goofy jokes. Still, this film is fun and diverting, though it will NEVER make anyone forget the REAL King Kong!"
3,It's tough being compared to a legend.,"I will agree this movie gets ripped on more than it deserves but for whatever good things it has going, it seems to have just as many bad. It has a great John Barry score , a great visual look , and some great looking locations. The restored aspect is far superior to the full screen version and the DVD looks great. Bridges is ok, and Grodin plays a good sleazy corporate weenie type. Where the thing drags for me is the Jessica Lange character. We know she is an Oscar caliber actress and even though this is her first big role, I'll blame the writers for it. Some of her dialog is so bad it's almost good. She does look great here (she was in her early 20's). If you go into it without comparing it to the original, it's not a bad adventure/action/monster flick."
1,WHAT???????????????,"i watched this twice just to be sure,and i was right!!!,i still don't understand just what this movie was about except that a lot of stunt men got a paycheck and several actors sliped down the list to become grade z list actors.avoid this stinker like the pox!!!!!!"
3,Weird B-flick,"This is a very bad movie. If you like bad movies you'll probably enjoy this, though it does seem to drag on."
1,chipmunk cheeks pro-anarchy,"OK. Omega doesn't seem all that bad. And the solution is worse!Let's see, a society of technology, cleanliness, law and order destroyed by by bikers, punks and folks who've never seen a bath led by chipmunk cheeks. I am not seeing an improvement here.Go Omega!Oh yeah, how come Persis has an accent but dad doesn't?"
1,Don't buy this one!!!,"Absolutely horrible, after only a couple weeks it started making funny noises, skipping in the CD, after a couple months it ate a cassette and it still lies in the belly of the beast. Less than a year and can't return it... NOT A GOOD INVESTMENT!!!"
2,Does NOT Come With Remote!,"This Deck Does NOT Come With A Remote!I've Talked To The Manufacturer Directly & It Seems It's A ""Mistake""!Still One Of The Best 1-Dins Out There Though...."
1,I should have listened to other rating!,"Had 1 week, and other than very difficult to read front panel, that I can live with, but as already destroyed one of my favorite cassettes, the Ways of a Ship, I was heartbroken, well very sad, it just stopped and I ejected with a few feet tape behind and completely cut off. The whole reason I bought was to have a cassette player. I afraid to use it again, if I were you look somewhere's else."
4,I love it,"I didn't like it so much when I opened the box, but after I wore it for a while, I grew to love it. It's a simple watch, unisex, and elegant. At $50 it's great."
1,CK should stick to making perfumes,I bought this as a gift for my wife a year ago and it has stopped working. And its not the battery. I have bought watches that were less costly and lasted way longer. I bought it because of the look and the CK brand name but in future I think I will stick to brand names that are known for making watches.
2,Embroidered Facts,The author freely mixed fact with fiction. No disclaimer was written about the fictionalized conversations that may have happened. The author puts herself in the minds of people she has never met. The thoughts and conversations of Derrick Todd Lee and his victims are just of those she fabricated in her own mind. No one knows what happened during the minutes or hours before the murders of these women and for Mustafa to write embroidered senerios without a disclaimer is in poor taste.
4,LA Serial Killer,"I lived 2 blocks away from Oak Shadows subdivision and the cememtary where the teenagers were attacked and my children went to school with them. I found this book to be very accurate and realistic, and reading about it really hit home even though I lived right in the middle of it. I guess we were all trying to be cautious, while maintaining some sort of normalcy throughout this ordeal and reading about it just made it all the more real to me. God bless these families."
4,modulator,"with the cost of radios, with direct connections, going down, this is old technology. i have it on my old jeep and it works much better than the older modulators. almost like a direct connect. if you have the time, patience, and no money for a new radio, then this works great. if you have $100, spend it on an aftermarket radio with a direct aux input connection."
4,Best Cd Ever,I really like this cd one of links best cd's that ive listen to in a long time. Can't wait to listen to his next cd.
1,Not impressed,"This game looks attractive. It is colorful and fairly durable. However, game play is very slow and boring. The activities at the station stops are lame and not engaging. Landing on the station stop stars to win the game can literally take two hours. No child has that kind of attention span. I would not recommend this game to anyone. I would not buy it again. Pick another game!"
2,game disappointing,I orderd this game just for something alittle different that other board games. The playing pieces are sturdy but very large for the small board. It is hard to see where you are when marching around the board. Directions are not clear and the kids get bored before we are halfway around. Stick with Sorry or Monopoly.
1,Is Matfer rolling pin gold-plated?,"Someone needs to do a better job of proofing these item descriptions and prices. That being said, $359.76 for a rolling pin?!!!"
4,I bought this for my actual field guide.,I have the fifth edition in my home and leave it there so it was time to get an actual field guide to carry in my car. I'm very pleased with this edition! The range maps may be slightly out of date and there are no small range maps with each bird as with the fifth edition but I can deal with that. The book is smaller and lighter than later editions making it easier to carry. It is an ideal field guide.
5,Great Used Book,"Aside from a bit of a shipping delay due to weather, this used book appears new and arrived in just over a week. The information inside already helped me to identify a few birds I was unfamiliar with. In addition I now know I have a resident Great Horned Owl by comparing the way I would write what I've heard to what was discribed in the text."
3,"Not a complete reference, but not a bad guide","This book is good for those times when you remeber a little fact about a song, and just needed to lookup that info. Since it is arranged in song order, its not hard to find info on a particular song quickly. This book is not going to explain lyrics, its will however point towards what infuenced them. Not the best Floyd book out there, but not the worst."
2,Not A Clue,"While the book's title and subject matter present an interesting topic and a ""must-read"" look to any Pink Floyd fan, Cliff Jones simply dropped the ball with this one. His ""in-depth description"" of the meaning behind every Pink Floyd song is suspect at best, often simply rambling on about something I've read somewhere else before or by writing a description that often has nothing at all to do with the song itself. While the book has many quality color and black & white photographs, many have poor cutlines or misidentify the persons in the picture (in one instance, Jones misidentifies Roger Waters!!!). If you're a true Floyd fan, it's a quality buy for novelty alone. But if you're looking for the true meaning behind the songs of Pink Floyd, this ain't the book for you."
1,This is research?,"Okay, I didn't actually buy this book, I saw it at Borders and was thumbing through it. I didn't see Roger Waters name in the back of the book, judging by another reviewer it must have been a typo. And then the Discography was a joke. It mentions all the Floyd albums but only Syd Barret's solo stuff. So I took a look at the little timeline in the back of the book and it listed Radio KAOS as Radio CHAOS. And the guy lists himself as a Floydophile. He maybe a Floydophile, but he doesn't know the first thing about radio or Roger's albums. There's a reason its KAOS and that's because its a renegade rock station in LA. Sheesh. That alone was enough to turn me off the book.The sad part is that apparently this guy works for Rolling Stone."
2,Not The Best PF Book,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, however when I did finish it, I found it full of errors. The band member's birthdays aren't correct in a couple of cases. Not to mention... that Roger Waters is referred to as ""Roger Watts"" in some early picture captions. I would imagine Mr. Jones is not to happy about the typo butcher job. Not all bad either, some interesting insights on the band & songs, but if you know your Floyd, it isn't anything new.I wish I could be more positive, but I expected to find out something NEW! Not a rehash of other books. IMHO, even if these books are older you would do better to spend your money on a ""Saucerful of Secrets"" & ""Crazy Diamond""... a great book about early Floyd and Roger Keith Barrett."
4,Informative and fun,"I very much enjoyed this book and could not put it down. I own everything from Dark Side on but still read the early stuff to get a good idea of the early Syd Barrett stuff. I found it all very interesting as I love Pink Floyd. I, like other readers, noticed misidentifying Roger Waters which was quite surprising. I have been a Pink Floyd ""fanatic"" for a long time but most of the stories were not ""old"" to me. I expected a little more indepth understanding of the lyrics but it was still insightful. I would definitely recommend this book to the serious Floyd fan."
2,Decent... Not Remarkably Worth It,"This case it not terrible, but I really would not recommend it. The black design is really boring after a while, and the leather starts to look a bit odd if you just keep it in your bag. The way it flips up can tend to be a bit odd, seeing as it is partially inhibited by the headphone jack.However, if you are just looking for something that will get the job done and is inexpensive, it will function. This product holds the Zune rather securely, and won't allow to buttons to be pressed while closed. Also, it snaps shut pretty tight. However, be careful because a bit of the top near the corners and the botton corners are exposed to everyday wear and tear. Overall, if you want crude protection without an ounce of flare, this is your product."
4,Great protection..... But,This item has worked great but the maker did not configure the hole for the ear bud connection very well.You cant have the earbuds connected to the top and close the flap at the same time. I corrected this problem by taking an xacto knife and cutting out arectangular piece from the top corner that allows me to keep the earbuds connected at all times.
3,I owned this for about 11 minutes...,"Well... it looked good in the box. I purchased this and opened it in my car. I could already tell that I'd made a mistake. I put my zune in it anyway... and took it right back out. It had a really ""old"" look to it that I didn't like. It fit the Zune just fine, and I'm sure it would have protected everything as intended... but it was just plain ugly.So... I had this back in the store before the receipt was even wrinkled. The silly pouch that came with Zune is better than this thing."
5,Great case,"I bought this for my husband's Zune (30 GB) and he loves it. Thus far it's strudy and durable, plus it looks great."
3,Good holder,"This does a good job of holding my zune and keep it firmly attached to my waist. It is a little hard to hit some of the zune buttons while it is in the holder, but it is still a very fine product."
5,Excellent Purchase!!,This is the perfect cover for the Zune. It protects it well and fits right on your belt loop. The cover stays closed and is easily accessible for opening. The quality is wonderful as well.
4,dlo follio,apears to be exactly what i wanted . noticed while working it was coming off my belt because i wear a wider belt. zune goes in very tight and comes out very hard hope it loosens up over time. all in all i like the style and looks.
3,One thumb up for the DLO Folio Case,"Overall, I'd give the DLO Folio case a thumbs up. It does have it's shortcomings, such as the flip portion of the case is rather hard to flip open when the headphones, or any other adapter, is in the jack. It takes a sort of pull up and out technique to get it to pass through the hole provided. But, really, that is my only complaint. Quite frustrating when the case is restricting the access of your Zune. The pros; however, outweigh the cons. The leather is soft and looks great when paired with your Zune. The gadget itself sits nice and snug inside the case and feels safe & secure. The buttons are easily pressed even through the protective plastic layer, and unlike the headphone jack, the USB port and hold button are easily accessed. It looks good, feels good, and keep my Zune clothed and comfy."
1,Horribly Dissapointing....,I bought this case because I heard about all of the good reviews. What a mistake. The plastic screen protector is EXTREMLEY scratch prone. After a couple of days of use it was all scratched up! I DO NOT recommend this to anyone. Splurge on a better case.
4,De primera,"Puro cuero. De primera. Muy buen acabado. Lo único es que no se ingeniaron nada para el cable, así que metes en su estuche al Zun pero el cable queda hacia afuera colgando, a menos que se lo saques.El plástico no entorpece en nada la pantalla."
4,Zune Folio,"I love my folio for my zune player. Nice leather, protective to my zune. holds up well with all my activity. prompt delivery on this item."
5,Very Nice Light,"I haven't had this long, but it sure seems like a great light. I wish it had the strobe function and a low setting, but for the application that I am using, it isn't a deal breaker. I have two other Streamlight flashlights and they are both really great durable performers."
2,company name too prominent,Item appears to be good quality but the appearance is ruined by embossing the companies name from the bottom so that it shows from the top. Since it is a drip pan the surface should be smooth when you wipe it.
4,Replacement Range Pans,"Purchased as replacement for original pans for a Wards/Tappan gas range; they are an adaquate replacement at a good price. Shipping was quick.RANGE KLEEN RGP-300 Chrome Range Round Pan/Orange Label (8.26""). Stamp on item indicate that they are American made."
1,Very cheaply made,"Considering these drip pans were clearly marked 'Heavy Duty Chrome Plated - made in USA"" I felt safe in assuming they would be made of a substantial, heavy grade metal, equivalent to the material used for my stainless steel rangetop and made to last a while. I was very disappointed to discover that they were very thin and probably easily bent by hand, if I chose to do so. It is hard to believe anyone could mistake them for 'original equipment' as stated on the label. Folks who pay thousands of dollars for a range would never find these drip pans acceptable as 'original equipment'."
5,LA Mariposa,"The book was written true-to-life and it uses appropriate spelling words for young students and wonderful Spanish words for everyone. Excellent color illustrations. I would recommend this book to an adult or older student so they could read it to a younger child, K through the 4th grade."
5,Heartstart battery,The battery came in a reasonable amount of time in good condition and with a late expiration date.
3,expensive but necessary,"This battery is expensive, but fortunately you only have to replace it every few years."
4,House Slipper & Errand Shoe.,Good if your not going to be on your feet for a long period of time. Good for errands & light yard work.
4,Wish they came in W width,"These are sturdy enough to wear as shoes (practically) and the leather is beautiful in color and texture. We truly wanted to keep them, but they were too narrow for us. I believe they are true-to-size in the width, but we needed Wide. I looked around other sites and finally found a pair of Minnetonka mocs that were Wide, but they weren't this shoe. They're fine, but these would have been better."
5,Men's Moccasins,"Bought these for my husband...but this is his 3rd pair thru the years. He loves them, they are leather with an outdoor sole...and he wears them everywhere for casual dress ...jeans or khakis. They are soft when purchased, but break in quick and are very comfortable he says. I would recommend these to any guy that likes a slip on shoe that is looiking for comfort."
1,Avoid Averatec,"I bought an Averatec 3150H notebook in January. The first one had defective battery and I returned it. The replacement had problems with screen, I sent it in for repairs and it stayed in their repair shop for over two months waiting for parts! By July, the keyboard would stop working whenever the machine had been on for a half hour. Averatec's product quality is inferior and their service is non-existent. Don't waste your money on this brand."
2,hot hot hot,"The computer is great it has everything i need, but the fan is on the bottom and when it gets hot it just cuts off. NO WARNING, SO SAVE OFTEN. Going to try a cool pad hope it works."
5,"Small, light and economical","It is a great priced notebook except few things.It heats up at the bottom, the fan is at the bottom, therefore you have to place something under it, coolpad will be the best.The keyboard is difficult to adjust, number keys are very small, deletion is at the top right, Shift is at very far right therefore every time I press up arrow. I bought an external keyboard but it is not convenient every time. Control key is not on the left corner.Except that is great for many applications, previous reviewer complained about DVD sound, DVD sound is set by default to confortable setting, you can change that setting and have loud and great sound.Few times it booted itself, I don't know if is software or hardware problem. Battery life is not so great arund 2 hr.DVD plays flawlessly. Wireless is great and easy to use, just press a button.Want a cheap and lightweigt, I may recoomend (except keyboard, if it would bother you, don't buy it)"
1,"If you don't know, then teach. Maxine Paetro did.","Maxine Paetro was never a Madison Avenue star. She was a political player and con-artist. She was also a total pig who could pee on her scarf in the ladies room, and then wrap it around her neck and wear it to a conference meeting like it was high fashion. Yes, this story is from someone who was there when it happened, and worked with her.The best advertising she ever did was coming up with the title of her book (if the title was in fact her own idea).She's been cashing in on that useless book for over 30 years, and giving false hope to the young people who spend their hard earned money to buy it.If there is anything Maxine Paetro can teach you, it's that if you're lucky, and a socially networking political whore, even an unlovable and empty shell of a woman can make enough money to keep herself in expensive shoes."
2,"Works fine, until the button breaks","Really neat idea. Three levels of brightness. The problem is with the cheaply designed switch. The switch internally rotates with each depression of the button. The switch itself is smaller than a dime and made of plastic with metal contacts that rotate. Once the contacts fail to rotate then the expensive flashlight is useless. My flashlight failed before the batteries gave out. So I guess one set of batteries is all you will ever have to buy for this flashlight.I would only recommend a flashlight that has on and off. This type of switch has to be a lot more reliable. Also, LED light is ok for small flashlights, but I still prefer to have a normal light bulb in a heavy two D-cell flashlight."
1,Novelty Item,"Bought this light last year. Nice light with three options low high and single bulb. Find the light is not very bright. For the price, better off getting new HID light. Picked up Redline Nebo. BRIGHT LIGHT. Good throw capability."
4,Good product with one flaw.,"I used these to replace the knobs on my stove because the printed numbers were rubbing off the stove surface. I wanted numbers that would not rub off with wear and these are stamped or etched onto the metal plates on the knobs.But...The colored inserts fit my stove control standoffs but they allowed the standoff to go all the way through. This meant that when i pushed down on the knob to turn it, the knob just slid down the standoff without pressing it in. I put some thick epoxy on the tops of each insert to create a 'stop' for the standoffs so they would work properly."
3,Decent I suppose,"It said they would fit my range, as I checked it out before I bought. Yet when I received them, they didn't even come close to fitting. So DOUBLE CHECK your make and model. They were decent knobs, but we couldn't use them and not worth spending the $ to ship them back."
5,Nice book with great pictures,This is an excelent atlas. I do not know of an other book on the market to day that will fill the gap this book dose. the pictures are excelent and would be of benifit to any 1st year pathology resident as well as a refrence to a practicing pathologist.
3,ok for he price,"This is a handy light, and a decent value. When compared to a SureFire flashlight, this is nowhere near as good (although the SureFire is 3 times the cost). The beam adjustment doesn't seem to work very well. It is useful to have the two intensities available in one unit, though, and it is better than a bulky D cell flashlight."
2,Not worth it!,"The xenon bulb is bright and powerful. The expensive lithium batteries only power it for a few hours, then your left with only the 3 LED bulbs which Streamlight claims give off 25 lumens. Nonsense! My mini maglite rated at 5.3 lumens easily outshine those LEDS by a wide margin.Only useful in 2 hour XENON mode, useless in LED mode."
1,no such book exists,This book was never written. It was to be the third volume in a series on Aquinas' Summa Contra Gentiles. Kretzmann had just finished volume two before his unexpected death. I believe it was published posthumously. I don't think he even had a chance to begin volume three.
3,Deleting is easier than claimed,"I doubted it could be so difficult to delete a message as was claimed in the previous review, and so I looked up the user manual for this recorder. The manual says that the complicated procedure only applies when deleting messages in the ""S"" folder, which sorts messages by date. To delete messages in the ordinary ""A"" through ""C"" folders takes just one button press."
1,forget this marchent,I rcvd this late and when I finally did I was disappointed hardly ever used...ha! ha!...it never work....keep the money it was the principla aobut the the whole thing...if you are going to sale something make sure u provide what u say....
3,Next time I'll get one with more hours,"Mine can only record about 40 minutes. When I'm ready to upgrade, I'll get one with more hours.If I have already recorded something, the next recording moves into another folder. I don't know what would happen if you tried to do more than 4 short recordings, however.One nice thing is that I can plug in my headphones and the playback is very clear."
3,Difficulty in transcribing,"Can someone tell me how to backspace just a sentence or two? When ever I press the back button in the S folder, it goes all the way back to the beginning of the taped meeting. I am trying to transcribe notes from the meeting and want to go back only a sentence or two to repeat what I heard. Can anyone help me with this?"
1,a real pain to delete messages,"Olympus really blew it this time!On their previous digital recorder, you pressed the delete button, to delete a message, during or after it played. Now, you can only delete it AFTER it plays, and it requires pressing THREE DIFFERENT BUTTONS to delete one message.I often record and/or review and delete messages while I'm driving. This new deleting method makes it impossible, without taking your eyes off the road. I hope Olympus realizes this was a REALLY BAD IDEA!"
2,you get what you pay for,"You get what you pay for. This thing does its job...plays CDs. However, the buttons and controls are somewhat confusing. The big knob that you'd expect to use for the volume is actually used to tune the radio. The up and down keys you'd expect to use to tune with are used for the volume control. The volume control keys are the ones you'd expect to use to change the tracks. Also, the inscriptions on the buttons lasted about a month. The white ink that is used to lable each key wore off quickly leaving only your best recollection as to which button does what. Like I said, you get what you pay for."
1,Avoid at all cost,"Another ""Off Brand"" company producing equipment that will not last. The CD player is not so bad when you can get it to work which after a few months might not be that often. I sent my unit in for repair while still under the warrenty period and they sent it back still broken and in the process they ruined the tape player and scratched up the face plate. Horrible company."
4,Some good advice for the beginner.,"These are ""lecture notes"" from a course taught by Knuth. The first third of this pamphlet is extremely useful and should be read by all researchers who are beginning to write technical papers. The remainder of the pamphlet is more spotty in quality and is marred by some needless digressions and ocassional obsession with minutae. In other words, it violates its own advice: it is not concise and to-the-point.All in all, a useful resource. It is never boring, and as a bonus provides a good idea of Knuth's teaching---which I have never witnessed first hand."
3,Full of great action scenes. Very poor picture quality.,"Even on DVD, the movie looks as blurry as an old VHS tape. This movie was great in the 80's. Compared to today's standard, it's still above average. It's worth renting not buying."
2,Not as good as I remembered,"I remember seeing this in the 1980s. I thought it was ok then, now seeing it again I think my standards must have been a little lower then. Save your money and time and get the Wild Bunch instead."
4,Great Movie From the Director of Good Bad Films,"Sure, the script may not be the smartest thing to come out of Hollywood, but it is just a good old extremly bloody fun movie. What amazed me about this film is that the main stars really give their characters a sense of believablity, very uncommon in movies of this kind."
3,I thought fullscreen died with DIVX?!!,"As with the previous reviewer; I also agree that caveat emptor...buyer beware! I love this movie but was very unhappy to learn that the DVD was only in the Fullscreen format. As with Remember the Titans, I am learning to be a little bit more careful with my assumption that all DVDs are in the Widescreen/Letterbox edition. There are very basic scene selections and an even more basic Bio page for this DVD. No zoom, no subtitles...not too much to impress, just the meat and potatoes. A good movie to watch, but don't expect the DVD format to impress, or entertain you beyond the movie."
4,Just In Case You Thought Walker Was The Only Bad A** Ranger,"Nick Nolte plays a Texas Ranger the way Chuck Norris plays Walker, only without all the kicking. This movie is violent, there is some nudity, and there is quite a lot of profanity. If that offends you, be forewarned. It also has one of the best character actors in the business in it, mr Rip Torn as the crusty old Texas sherrif. His performance alone is worth seeing the movie."
4,Extreme Predjudice,a classic which includes the real thing: Real Texas Rangers......a bit predictable; It was great to see Matt Damon at such a young age.
2,Terribly Disappointing!!,"I bought this film because it was based in many ways on the life and work of the great Texas Ranger Joaquin Jackson. Nick Noltes captured Jackson's style of dress and may have been accurate in some of the mannerisms, but that's where the positives of the film stopped for me. The plot is weak, the dialogue is choppy and sometimes hokey and the storyline is never established. This is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen. Its part of my library but not because it's a great movie."
2,"I Know, Let's Try Peckinpah !","When it comes to steely eyed stares, Clint Eastwood has nothing on Nick Nolte. Except Nolte is a fine actor whose talents are largely wasted in this tiresomely Johnny-one-note performance. Powers Boothe whose on-screen charisma is a match for Nolte's, expresses a broader range as the villian, but apparently never got the big break his talent deserves. Too bad. The movie itself goes downhill after a promising beginning. Director Walter Hill is simply unable to weave the subplots of a murky script by that avatar of violence for its own sake - John Milius - into anything like an engaging whole. The result is a fatal crash dive into gruesomely nonsensical parody of The Wild Bunch. The upshot provides a lesson for those who have the blood lust of a Peckinpah, without his cinematic stylishness or moral sensibility. In fact, the film probably works better as parody, particularly Nolte's cartoonish Texas Ranger. A waste of fine talent on third-rate bravado. Save your money."
5,THE ENDING ISN'T AS IMPORTANT AS THE TRIP,"It was an enjoyable journey through a strange place and quite a cast of eccentric, warm, briney characters. A wonderful read!"
2,Stiff but poignant,"While the story of two brothers and the legacy of silence and withholding that their father bequethed to them is affecting, the writing is disappointing, awkward and self-conscious. What's really frustrating is Dolan's lack of insight into the central issue in the book--the estrangement between he and his brother. I feel like he wrote the book 10 years too soon."
2,Poorly edited?,"I bought this book for my Kindle, and I could not even finish it. I did try a sample first and was not too impressed, but since I have enjoyed other books by this author, I went ahead and bought it anyway. Not only are there too many characters, but I would be reading one paragraph with one of the characters, and suddenly the very next paragraph jumped to a different scenario with a different character. It took a few seconds to realize this happened and it got to be very annoying after a while. Maybe this is just the case with the Kindle edition, who knows? But I was unable to get into the story or care about any of the characters."
3,A Good Read,"This was a good and fast read. I liked the main character and the story moved along at a nice speed. I think this is the first book I have read of Wendy Corsi Staub, but I am going to check out more of hers."
3,Motorhead - 'Recorded Live 1978' (Big Beat),"Not a bad live CD from Motorhead in their early years. However, it's the SAME EXACT show that's been released on two other Motorhead titles now. First, the $2.99 cassette bargain tape called 'What's Words Worth?'. If you remember,this tape was available at seemingly EVERY book store, super market, gas station and Kmart. We all know how lame Kmart's music dept. usually is. And second, the Cleopatra label had reissued this show under the name 'Iron Fist & The Hordes From Hell' with a killer cover (see my review)."
1,Poorly Formatted,"This review is specific to the Kindle edition which is impossible to read due to formatting problems. As a previous reviewer noted, even on the smallest size font the end of many of the poems is cut off. I even tried reading it on my PC to see if that helped - it didn't. A great pity because the content deserves five stars. Don't waste your time downloading this version, even if it is free. Either wait until the formatting issues have been resolved, or pay for a decent version."
5,Excellent edition,"A very high-quality hardback edition, with thick paper, sewn binding, and fine, full-size reproductions of Blake's illustrations from the excellent Cambridge originals. Originals vary a good deal; compare these with the muddy ones used in the Oxford edition. Each illustration faces the associated poem, the only sensible layout, but something the Oxford edition does not do, for some reason. The introductory notes by Richard Holmes are brief, but extremely good.All that's lacking are detailed explanatory notes for the individual poems, but those are available on web and elsewhere, and they aren't much needed for these poems in any case."
2,Kindle edition is disappointing,"The poems are amazing, but the Kindle edition is mediocre. The poems are poorly laid-out, lines unaligned. There is no thought to the aesthetic look of the page. And, worst of all, there are none of Blake's illustrations, which are integral to the poems and would be gorgeous on a Kindle or pad."
2,Format Needs Attention,"I wanted to love this book, but it has no contents page. As a newbie to Blake's poetry, I need some structure. Maybe if you already know your Blake, you can use the search function and be happy."
2,Not worth owning,"The size of book is tiny and the color plates are so dark that the text of most poems are difficult, if not impossible, to read."
3,A Little Disappointing,"Enjoyed the content, but the book appears to have been cheaply printed. It took away from the beauty of Blake's poetry."
1,unhappy,this product has not worked right since the first day and all efforts to reach customer service have failed. i would return it but as i am on a fixed income i cannot afford to purchase another just now. i will certainly think twice before i order this kind of thing from amazon again.
5,It be blowing my mind,I was not expecting much from War and Gender. But this book radically changed how I looked at the constructions of gender. It's phenomenal.
3,Complete and fair assesment,"I read the book some months ago, and I got the impression that it was quite complete, and fairly assessed. On the other hand, it almost dropped from my hands half a dozen times, because, although the subject was very interesting, most of the time the reading was boring. Therefore, my rate is 5 (content) and 2/3 (pleasure of reading).Other books on war that I would recommend would be:- above all, the best, ""War on Human Civilization"" by Azar Gat;- also, ""War before Civilization. The Myth of the Peaceful Savage"", by Lawrence Keeley; ""How War Began"" by Keith F. Otterbein; and ""War and Peace and War: The Rise and Fall of Empires"" by Peter Turchin."
2,not what you expect,I purchased this ramp kit expecting to get a pair of ramp tops and a pair of ramp bottoms. Based on the photos and the description by the manufacturer. Well this kit only contains ramp tops. There are no bottoms in this kit despite the appearance that there is.
2,Nothing Special Here,"I will preface the review that I believe most of the tenets of ""Peak Oil"" and related arguments. I picked up this book after seeing it in a side-bar banner add on a popular peak oil forum. I was disappointed as soon as I started reading. my main comments on the book are1) The book doesn't offer any new data on the topic, but instead gives a rehash of peak oil along with some alarmist consequences2) The book doesn't offer any tenable strategies to survive the author's ""power down"" scenario. Kunstler in his book ""Long Emergency"" gives more meat here (though still not too much).3) The author gets sidetracked in a conspiracy theory discussion on Bush, the Iraq war, and various other ills of the military-industrial complex. Generally I think these types of theories don't add a lot to the discourse, and was annoyed to see ""Bush is Bad"" references sprinkled throughout.Bottom line is: not terrible, but not worth $10."
3,Not as good as The Party's Over...,"While Heinberg summarizes the lit. on oil depletion and fuel shortages, this book branches into imagined political outcomes--basically, the demise of liberal culture, the individual, and our civilization. (Examples: no oil, little fuel, population decline to 3.8 billion humans, etc.) He offers ""rational"" alternative end-games and scenarios, but his thinking predicates that human beings and societies are and can be ""rational."" If you accept that, then, OK, this analysis is for you.He thinks and believes that policy makers and politicians are not paying attention, however; that is, by not paying attention, they are behaving irrationally. Well, duh. Then what is the importance of ""rational"" ""powerdown"" ""life-boat"" strategies?The result? I thought this book was watered down and apocalyptic political science, with some power data interspersed. His other book, The Party's Over, was better."
1,Item Did Not Match What Was Pictured,"This item was not what is pictured. I ordered 2 6"" rings and 2 8"" rings. None of the items have the indentation in the inner part that my stove requires. If you look at the picture, there is an indentation where the burner attaches to the heating element. The rings that arrived did not have that indentation, so they are useless to me.The fact that the metal is shiny is nice, but it's also cheap: The 2 8"" rings arrived BENT. So even if they had matched the image, I'm not sure they would have been usable.DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM FROM THIS SELLER."
5,GOOD VALUE,"The steps arrived promptly, went together easily, and work just fine. Height works well on our bed. Dogs learned to use them fairly easily. (Dogs are 55 & 75 lbs.) The carpeted treads are velcro'd for removal."
4,Good for Big and Small,"We really like this stair. It is wide and sturdy. Our dogs ranging from miniture poodle mix to black lab all use it. We especially wanted it for our Welch Corgi who jumps on and off the bed and we are worried about the impact on his back. He hops up and off on his own and enjoys that. It took us only a few minutes to get him to use it a few others were slower,but we just left it in place with plenty of space around it and pretty soon everyone was using it. It is very sturdy. Serves it's purpose well."
3,Misleading,"When the product description states ""for dogs up to 150 lbs"" you are not talking about a small animal so I ordered this for my 97 lb golden retriever. So I was very surprised when I opened the box and saw that the paper instructions state: ""For small animals only"" And these stairs are narrow for my dog. I will have to lead him up and down. The also are not tall enough to reach my bed, but would be fine for a couch, heightwise.They were cheap at 21 dollars so I'll keep them but I am still looking for something else that is wider and more sturdy for my dog."
4,"Great flashlight, some minor problems","I bought this flashlight in November of 2003. My intention was to purchase a high quality flashlight that would last a long time and I believe the Streamlight fits my requirements nicely. The construction is patterned after Mag-Lite's series of flashlights and is very solid. I have not been able to scratch the anodized casing.The LEDs are very bright and can be turned on 5 at a time or all 10 at a time. Usually, 5 is enough for anything I need to do. The xenon-bulb is unfortunately not particularly bright. It's comparable to a Mag-Lite but not to some of the other high-power lithium-battery flashlights that you can buy. There is a rotating lens that can focus the beam but it only really works for the xenon bulb. For the LEDs, the lens only changes the beam from reasonably concentrated to very diffuse."
2,Strange Product,"Liked Mag Lite, got tired of replacing batteries, and its a bit over large. Streamlight sounded good, more efficient design with LEDs and traditional Xenon combination and with aircraft alum construction.Realiy is that the construction is indeed great, equal of Mag. Problem is that the LED light is really strange flourescent-like blue that doesn't project much light at all. What it does project is off color and tends to distort colors of other things. Find myself going for more light from the xenon quite often (and in process loosing the LED efficiency benefit), but the way this designed, with 10 holes to accomodate the LEDs the reflector weakens the xenon into a short, limited beam. ""A"" for construction quality, but other than that this product doesn't satisfy if you are seeking real brightness."
3,"Good flood, poor spot.","I use this light for exploring abandoned mines and tunnels, and for many kinds of high-concept Urban Exploration. We need a lot of bang for the buck because space is limited. This light has excellent wide area illumination for the size, especially at full power, but no long-range spot capability at all. The piddly weak Xenon bulb is laughably ineffective and I have yet to find a use for it. This light would be perfect if it had a long-range spot feature, such as a Halogen or Krypton bulb instead. Nice and steady in hand and beefy enough to use as personal defense in close-quarters hand to hand combat with someone using a MagLite. [...]"
2,concur with previous review,"i concur with what someone else said, that the xenon bulb is practically no brigher than the led, very possibly the led is brighter than the xenon, therefore there is really no point in having a dual purpose flashlight. i didn't want to leave a ""bad"" review... but i returned this light for refund. i do think streamlight makes quality products and intend to someday buy a different model"
3,Built well but...,"This flashlight is built very well. It is made for rugged use. My chief disappointment is the amount of light output from the LED bulbs AND the Xenon bulb. The LED output is a ""whiter"" light but it is not focused very well. It's like turning on a very low powered flood light. The Xenon bulb is advertised as being very bright - I own a $3.00 two cell flashlight with a brighter light. Bottomline, if you want a rugged, reliable flashlight, this is a good one. If you want a bright light - look elsewhere."
1,don't waste your money,"Without a doubt one of the worst new wave flashlights I've ever tried. Yeah it is built like the proverbial brick house but the spot is weak, the flood is weak, it eats batteries. There are a ton of way better and similarly priced flashlights available on Amazon. I would not waste your money on this one."
1,Crappity-crap-crap! P-U!!,"Didn't even outlast the first set of batteries before the thing just stopped working. I didn't bother contacting the company because I was so disappointed (and wouldn't even want to use it anymore). I will never buy anything from Streamlight again. Performance is poor, the LED light is blue and the Xenon is a joke. $45 bucks tossed into the recycling bin--wasted money. See my other reviews for a far superior light."
4,"nice, small, but bright light","The flashlight works well and the output is quite bright for its battery size. I've had larger Streamlights, which were known for durability and quality and this light appears to be no exception. The lanyard is a nice touch, for example, I have one hanging on a hook by the back door, which makes it convenient and out of the way. The only thing preventing 5 stars is that you have to press the on/off switch twice, to switch from normal lamp to the LEDs and the LED beam is better focused, producing a smaller, more concentrated spot of light, than the normal lamp. All in all, I'm very happy with the flashlight, which gets a lot more use than my other models, simply because of the convenience and performance in a relatively small package."
3,I don't like it,"The Xenon bulb illuminates less than the LED bulb, and the two function botton is uncomfortable. Also, this flashlight is a bit long."
2,Disappointed,"The construction quality of the drip pan was very good, however the design left a lot to be desired. I bought them for protection for my stovetop but the center hole is so big it's pretty much useless. Just makes another thing to clean."
1,Misleading Seller,I purchased the Range Kleen SGP-400 Chrome Square Gas Pan which stated in the Product features it was sold in pack of 12 for 3.50 which I though was a great deal instead they ship me one unit. They should never say pack of 12 on the website if it was not true. Ill never shop with this seller again.Product FeaturesChrome square gas panSold in pack of 12Manufactured to the Highest Quality Available.Design is stylish and innovative. Satisfaction Ensured.Great Gift Idea.
2,"Leaves only, please","The unit was easy to assemble. It is a bit on the noisy side, as other reviewers have mentioned. Also, it is sometimes hard to get stable on a slightly slanted yard. If you are serious about doing leaf shredding, then you'll want to set the machine on top of a tarp and move it around the tarp as the piles of shredded leaves mound up under the machine.The biggest downfall is how fragile it is: This is a leaf shredder only. It cannot handle even the smallest twig or branch without jamming or breaking the shredding devices inside. This was a big problem for me since its very difficult to 'screen' out every little branch before loading rake-fulls of leaves into the hopper. I got tired of having to constantly shut it down, unclog it due to some unshredded twig, restarting it, and then re-loading all the unshredded leaves, trying to screen out any twigs on the way.Because of this I have since stopped using it."
5,Flowtron Leaf-Eater,"This is an excellent value. Good basic item for fall cleanup chores. As others have mentioned, it is a string trimmer mounted upside down in a funnel. Replacement strings are easy to replace. Small bits of brush and twigs are handled well. It is, however, meant to reduce the volume of leaves, not brush. It will do slightly wet leaves, but care must be taken not to feed them in too fast, or the machine can overload. Used with a bit of common sense, it is a great yard cleanup aid."
3,Can be modified for better preformance,At first i wasn't all that thrilled with how well this thing worked. I started brainstorming on ways i could improve this thing and i finally got it!I went to home depot and bought the Echo Rapid-Loader replacement string trimmer cutting head(Universal Fit).Remove the original cutter head from the Flowtron. Place the large spacer that comes with the Echo cutter head in the Flowtron.Place the small spacer inside the Echo cutting head and then place the Echo cutting head on top of the large spacer you just put into the Flowtron.Use One of the universal(1 of 4) placed on the opposite side of the small spacer and the hex screw to tighten down the Echo cutting head.I used the .095 trimmer string and it didnt last too long but BOY DID THIS THING EAT LEAVES WITH AN APPETITE FOR MORE.Im going to load it up with .105 and .155 trimming string which should work even better and last longer than the .095 trimming string.
2,Leaf Eater doesn't have much of an appetite,"Machine is quick to clog when leaves are slightly wet. Requires frequent stopping to unclog. Red string cutters wear out quickly, have to be replaced often. I think machine would do well if leaves are completely dry, but that is not often the case here in Oregon."
4,Pleasantly suprised,"I found the Flowtron to be relatively easy to assemble. My experience with assembly is an electric lawnmower and assorted kid's toys. There have been many kid's toys that are significantly more difficult to assemble. I found it on the noisy side; however, my electric blower is noisier. I had no trouble with our oak and maple leaves. Does produce a good bit of dust, but my leaves have been sitting around for several months. The product met my expectations."
4,Efficient Machine,"Last year we had 17 full bags of leaves. This year it was 10, so the Leaf-Eater did what it was supposed to do. The only drawback was that the leaves had to be dry. When we put wet or damp leaves in they would clump and stall out the machine."
4,fun to use,this was a good product as long as you dont put long grasses or twigs in it. makes decent mulch
5,very good for a little shredder,"I was able to shred 4 bags of leaves into a small heap that ended up fairly mulched, and starting composting right away. It even shredded a good amount of ivy, though anything with a hint of wood fiber (small sticks, thick ivy stems, woody plant stems) had to be removed if they got stuck, or better yet painstakingly removed before shredding. If it becomes too full you have to turn off and unstuf it, but it is only a shredder with fishline; the tougher the material the faster the line gets eaten down to a few inches, but it comes with ample replacements."
3,Cursed by anything but leaves,"The Flowtron is perfect for a leaf only composting project. I live in Lubbock, TX where there are trees coming out of manicured lawns, with little brushy matter in between,as would be common in other parts of the U.S. Therefore it's an inexpensive and effective solution to my particular leaf shredding situation.However, this product would probably be useless if pitted against a combination of leaves, sticks and branches.It gets 5 stars for my situation, perhaps 0 stars for other conditions."
1,Worthless,"We tried to use this product. It jams up very easily unless you just sprinkle the leaves in. We had 22 bags of leaves; would have taken us an entire day of ""sprinkling"" to get through all those leaves. The legs are really short - what bag besides a paper grocery bag is this going to sit over? And regular leaf bags are too tall for a garbage can, which it fits on.However, when it is grinding up leaves, it does grind them up as fine as advertised. We ended up packing it up and sending it back. We received the refund promptly."
3,Okay product,"This product took probably 20 minutes to assemble. I would rate the product just ""okay."" It is underpowered and makes LOTS of dust. Dry leaves had to be shredded twice: once on ""coarse"" and the second time on ""fine."" It is a space saver and reduces lots of bags of leaves to a few...that's a great plus. Also, the finely shredded leaves make a great mulch."
5,Leaf shredder,The Flowtron leaf shredder worked perfectly. It shredder the leaves into nice fine particles that provided a mulch that I spread all over the lawn rather than put it out for collection. I recommend that the user use a dust mask because the shredder shreds so fine that it creates a fair amount of dust.
3,Simple and practical guide,"Mr. Steven M. Bragg has provided numerous methods on improving the procedures over accounting matters. The book aims is to provide the reader with guidance towards improving efficiency while retaining controls. In addition, the reader might appreciate the guidelines on the perceived time and cost required to implement the recommended procedures.I found that this book provided a good reading and guide to experienced professionals working in well established multinational corproations as the content related to fundamental accounting matters. This book would be a wake up call for finance departments that had not focued on a balance of efficiency and control in the past."
4,"Unique, new and good","Weaving a musical quilt of previously unused sonic materials, Q-Project has created a jazzy, uptempo, transporting environment. The melodies are sometimes carefree, hype, and many are contemplative and introspective. They're carefully laid over tailored drums and perfectly timed voice samples. I think I even detected a ""Kill Bill"" sample in Bovey Pay. But they take a little while to digest, and at first can seem homogenous. But the undertones will eventually reach your palette, and you'll find yourelf going to songs that at first you skipped within the first few seconds. Good stuff!"
4,Great Cutting Power,"I must admit that I am not an amateur woodworker and I use my skill to suppliment my income. That being said, These bits need to be adjusted then the test pieces need to be dry fitted for a perfect almost tight fit. It may more then likely mean that you may have to remove more shims than the instructions say.The easiest way to me is to make all of your grooves first then cut test tongues until u get the fit you want, then continue with your cuts once the setting is right.I have made many doors with these bits and I am still very pleased today."
1,AMAZON FIX THIS!,Yep mine arrived chipped as well. One day they might get the message. All they would need to do is tape the packaging shut
1,Do not be deceived by these,"The other reviewers are correct about the poor packaging and the actual item shipped. I received mines about 10 mins ago and I am immediately dissapointed. The bits are not the ""red"" bits advertised and one was rolling around loose in the plastic box they came in. Careful inspection revealed that the edges of both bits are chipped because of the loose bit making contact with the other while shipping. The broken chips are still in the box. These bits are now probably not as useful as they are supposed to be. I wish I could retun these but I live outside the U.S. and its a hassel to do such returns..."
4,Great value/ Check for chipped cutters,"I've used these cutters on several projects now and I really like that they are adjustable since it seems that none of the plywood/melamine on the market seems to be consistent in thickness. This makes for a nicely fitting drawer bottom or door panel, but as others have said about 90% of them come with chipped cutters due to their poor packing."
5,Tongue and Groove Bit,The product arrived on time and in perfect shape. Packaging was good and secure. I have used the bits and they are very good.
1,Poor packing caused extensive damage.,"INSPECT YOURS CLOSELY BEFORE YOU USE IT!!!Mine were badly damaged due to an amazingly bad packaging job. The 2 bits arrived completely separate from their product packaging, which was completely closed, leading me to believe that they were thrown into shipping box like that. When I put them back in their package to return them, I shook it really hard, and cannot conceive that they could have shaken loose. Nearly every tooth suffered at least one chip, most of them very large, and 2 were cracked all the way through the tooth. If I used these bits, I'm confident they would have shattered, and thrown shrapnel. 100 % amazon's responsibility. I read another review mentioning the same problem. LOOK CLOSELY AT YOURS BEFORE YOU USE IT!"
2,Not happy with these at all,"These heavy T&G router bits fall out of their internal packaging and bang around in the box during shipping, thus chipping their razor-sharp carbide cutting surfaces. Not a safe situation to have running at 8,000-12,000 RPM. I was sent a replacement shipment, but it was also chipped. Wasted a lot of time with this one."
1,Wasted time and Cost,"Like some of the other reviews, my order arrived with the two bits unrestrained in a box that is way larger than necessary, resulting in chips to the carbide cutters. A simple wrap of tape around the manufacturer's retail package would have kept it from opening and freeing the tools. I've reordered but expect that once again I'll have to return them because the likelyhood of the actual shipping location will not get my comments included with the reorder."
2,Looks nice(ly) damaged,"Ordered, waited and got the bit in time for the weekend - I thought. The plastic box containing the bits was opened inside the package. Some of the cutters were chipped. Looks like this is something you should not order form Amazon. They do a great job but packing these bits seems to be a problem."
3,Confiming the bad news!,"Unbelievable! Doesn't anyone at Amazon read these reviews? I received my set a few days ago (it was delayed out-of-stock) and like the other comments, it was just dropped into a box 10 times its size with insufficient filler. The bits had come out of their factory pack and rattled around, letting them bang against each other. Fortunately they didn't seem chipped, but they easily could have been. AMAZON: Seal the Freud package with tape before shipping and pack the package so it cannot rattle!"
3,Shipping Problems Again.,"Amazon must not read these reviews! In spite of seeing the many notes of damage due to faulty packing, I ordered my set. Sure enough... they arrived loose in the box, with nicks in the cutter edges, just like many other people have observed. Freud makes a generally excellent product, but Amazon is damaging them consistently!!! It's a 5 star product with 0 star shipping."
1,Not good!,This was horrible they didn't stick on to my car and they didn't fit well. I put it on my car and you could still see part of my side molding then I put it on and held it for five minutes like they said went in the house and when I came back out a fewinutes later they had fell of and were on the ground so I tried contacting the seller and didn't return. My calls or my EMail won't ever by this crap again. Very cheep!
3,An even more miserable Werther,"Just like Goethe's ""Werther"", this book also gave rise to a series of suicides committed by yooung and romantic folks. But instead of being a novel, it is a play in three acts. Chatterton is an 18-year old poet, who lives in the house of John Bell, a rich businessman. He is in love with Kitty Bell, but to no end, as well as sunk in debt. When he gets convinced that young poets in love can not be happy at all, he kills himself. Poor guy."
1,Disappointing Iain Banks Book - read a different one!,"I am huge fan of Iain Banks (the non-sci-fi books) and was thoroughly disappointed with this book. I just felt that he used the main character, a radio show host ala Howard Stern, to say whatever he wanted. A huge rant and rave session. Even the storyline was too predictable to save the book. Don't waste your time reading this one, read some of his other books like The Business, Complicity and Whit."
2,Dead Air is full of dead wood...,"I'm about finished reading all of Iain Banks' books, and this one has to rank at the bottom so far.In Dead Air, the very unlikable ""shock-jock"" Ken Nott goes on with his daily life, watching (or rather imagining) the world revolve around him. Mix with this the diatribes and controversy associated with any shock jock persona, infidelity on top of indiscretion, and a mysterious ""crime boss"" who seems to be on Nott's mind a LOT after Nott decides to have an affair with his wife.I have to admit, with all the short passages on current issues in British and American society, what I was really expecting was the showdown between Nott and the crime boss. I mean, you know it's coming, right? Almost... false alarm... too quiet... defenses down... got away... BOOM!This book won't stop me from reading another Banks' novel, but it will give me pause when I'm recommending his books to others."
2,"Iain, open a Grange, and go back to Culture storytelling","I was disappointed in this, but mostly because I've seen Iain do better. It's not that Iain can't tell a story, but more that the characters in his non-SF books are less than consistent, aren't developed naturally and from time-to-time he goes into a long ravel on one politically cute topic or another, seemingly just for fun rather than for real character development or to truly further the plot. I think I'll reread one of his Culture books, as his drones have more personality that some of the characters in his non-Sf books.-Gurgeh"
4,Underrated,"I'm very surprised at the low rating of this book to date on Amazon. I found it to be good entertainment from beginning to end, and found I could relate to a lot of the scenarios and dialogue arising in the book. It is not a book based around one particular strong storyline but more about getting involved with the everyday life of one man and his friendships, relationships, vices and virtues. I found myself laughing out loud (intentional on author's part) near the end of the book during what was, at the same time, one of the most tense scenes when he broke into the house of his soon-to-be tormentor.Not my favourite Ian Banks book, but a good one as far as I'm concerned, and considerably better than the Business, the previous effort, which I did find dissappointing. I would like a return to something a bit darker though before Mr. Banks hangs up his pen for good."
3,Not his best but still good.,"Lots of political rants, it is true, but most of them pretty accurate and extremely funny. Banks is a master of comic prose, and if neither the plot nor the characters are as well worked out as in some of his other books (""The Crow Road"", ""Whit"", ""Espedair Street"") and his imagination isn't firing on all cylinders (as with ""The Bridge"" or ""Walking on Glass""), it is still the case that he could write about the weather and still make me laugh out loud."
4,TYPICAL ALLEN,"A FUN WAY TO PASS THE TIME. AS USUAL, THE BACKGROUND MUSIC IS GREAT. PRODUCT ARRIVED IN A TIMELY MANNER."
5,GOOD,"I really liked this comical movie. I think it had many laughs, and so did the rest of theater I was in."
2,Woody's weakest film? Say it ain't so!,"I love Woody Allen. In fact, he's probably my single favorite director, a great writer, and an artistic hero all around. But this is the weakest film I've ever seen of his. It only warrants a two. It has some nice moments, some good jokes, some cute scenes, and EXCELLENT cinematography, but as a whole it is weak.Woody is getting too old to be a believable romantic hero (along with Clint Eastwood: who'd ever think I'd get them together in one thought!), Helen Hunt is an overrated actress at best and wooden at worst, but not as wooden as Charlize Theron. And I question the logic of taking a brilliant, brilliant comedic actor like Dan Aykroyd and giving him the dullest character in the piece.maybe twenty years of more serious films has eroded Woody's ability to do a straight comedy like the slapstick bits of brilliance he began with.Though Hollywood Ending was much funnier."
1,Just a warning,"A lot has been said in the earlier reviews about plot, acting and what went wrong with this movie, so I won't repeat that. I'll just add a warning: If you, like I, really enjoy the genius of Woody Allen - stay clear of this one. It's way below his usual quality, and there are so many others to choose from. Any of his recent films, not to mention the classics, are more enjoyable."
2,A Somewhat Cursed Comedy,"A by-the-numbers Woody Allen movie, ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" is another example of the more recent (and uneven) efforts created by the director. Essentially sitcom material, the movie`s plot has some nice ideas and funny moments, yet it`s way too light and linear to deliver an above average cinematic experience. The acting (Helen Hunt and Charlizer Theros are the Allen girls this time) is good, the dialogue sharp and witty as always (although a bit forced at times), and the photography is very competent as well. Add an interesting NY in the forties and you`ve got a decent entertainment that`s worth watching once, still it`s far from a remarkable achievement.Mildly Recommended."
1,Woody gets woodener.,"Time for Mr. Allen to move aside, I'm afraid. This film is an embarrassment for all but his most dedicated fans. Deconstructing Harry was brilliant. He should have quit when he was ahead."
3,The 1940's Dectective,This film is a bit uneven with some really good sections and others that are ho-hum. However if you are enamored with the 1940's period for private detectives and fedoras this film get another star. Worth watching and maybe owning if you can get it at an inexpensive price.
4,The Importamce of Being Earnest,A movie that will appeal to people of all ages who have ever been in love.
3,First big screen adaptation of Oscar Wilde's hit,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.""The Importance of Being Earnest"" is arguably Oscar Wilde's best known work. The plot is a classic example of mistaken identity and is well known enough to justify not mentioning it in this review.The film, has great acting and includes an excellent performance by Margaret Rutherford, probably best know for her role as Miss Jane Marple in the 1960's ""Miss Marple"" films.There are 2 special features. A theatrical trailer and a slideshow of production photos with notes by Bruce Eder.This film is a true comedy classic film and remains popular to this day."
3,english comedy,"Not bad for an English Comedy, I believe early 1900'sActors are fun as is the plot - it is a comedy along the linesof Fawlty towers (farce comedy)"
4,BNC test leads,Perfect companion for my new signal generator. I Needed the longer leads to make it from my workbench shelf to the top of the workbench. Can't beat the price for the lenght and quality of these test leads.
5,Knights in Shining Armor Sometimes Play Guitars,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It starts of as what appears to be a breezy summer read with plenty of romance and some hot and heavy sex scenes thrown in for good measure. However, the denouement reveals that the book is much more than this. All the loose ends are tied together beautifully in the thought-provoking ending. The spirituality of the book really gets one thinking about the relationships in one's life. Why are we drawn to the people in our lives? What purpose do we serve in the lives of others? Do the choices we make in life have a greater cosmic significance than we know? Read this book. Laugh, cry, fantasize, enjoy, and reflect on your own place in the universe and the effect your actions have on others in this world and in the greater cosmic realm."
1,DO NOT BUY THE ALL REGIONS IMPORT OF THIS MOVIE,"I love this movie but I got scammed. I purchased the ""All Regions"" Import Dvd of this movie from a person by the name of ""Rong Ju Montage"" of China. Do NOT make the same mistake I made. The DVD he sent me was JUNK. I recorded a copy of this movie myself from TV many years ago. I wanted a better copy so I bought the DVD. The DVD I received was a worse copy than the one I had made myself from TV. The picture on the DVD I received was blurry and of very poor quality. The picture also quite noticeably jumped around. Again, do NOT buy any Import DVD of this movie. Otherwise you will get ripped off."
4,Better than the Remake,I really enjoyed this movie and felt it was better than the remake. Both this one and the new one hold to a very similar story line.
3,great movie,sorry to say that the vhs movie did not work in 3 of my machines. The tracking was off. Had to ship back to vendor.
5,"Stick with the original ""Four Feathers""","This is the truest version of ""Four Feathers"" available.The recent Heath Ledger-Djimon Honsu version suffers from Politcal Correctness and has wooden performances-esp.Cate Hudson.This original version was done during Hollywood's British Period of such films as ""Gunga Din"",and ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer"".Wonderful atmospheric production values and solid performances by all."
4,better four feathers,"A classic genre film of subsection Empire: pieces of it show up in Westerns, Costume Picture and so on: blind in the desert, called a coward by his fellow officers, saved by a bloke in disguise, BASHIBAZHOUKS. SEE IT."
5,The Four Feathers,"A pounding adventure shot in saturated Technicolor, superbly directed by Zoltan Korda (brother of Alexander, the film's producer), ""Feathers"" is top-notch entertainment based on A.E.W. Mason's classic novel. Clements is solid in the lead, but top acting laurels go to Ralph Richardson in a rare screen turn as Clements' friend and romantic rival, along with the incomparable C. Aubrey Smith as a crusty war horse. The scenes where Smith recounts his past glories in battle are peerless."
3,Great Movie. Not So Great Transfer,"There is no question that this is a classic film. It is exciting, spectacular, and features some of England's finest acting talent. However, the DVD transfer is far from satisfying. In fact,it is so mediocre, that one of the reviewers thought it was a colorized version!This film deserves better treatment. Filmed in Technicolor,the color registers are off much of the time, and the brightness rises and falls within many of the scenes.Hopefully, a restored version will be released to preserve this wonderful film in something close to its original glory. The Criterion Collection comes to mind. Considering some of the garbage they've preserved lately, it's about time they got around to a classic like ""The Four Feathers"".UPDATE: 8/9/11Well, I guess if you wish long enough, your wish might come true. It appears that the Criterion Collection is going to release a Blu-Ray version of this classic film on October 11. I for one will immediately pre-order it."
5,Best Candidate I Know for Resurrection via Computer on DVD,"This film has been remade by Hollywood twice with disastrous results. The original is still formidable. I have it on Beta and I saw the original as one of the first color pictures I can remember seeing. It should be duck soup for modern technology to recreate it in at least as good shape as it was originally without trying to change it in any other way. As I recall, the desert photography had the superb realistic quality seldom seen elsewhere (maybe Lawrence of Arabia). It ought to be a smash hit again - especially in today's world where the ""thin red line"" has been replaced by the ""thin red, white and blue line."""
2,Feels like the Crusades,"This movie glorifies the evil attempt of the West to suppress the religion and freedom of the Sudanese people led by their great Mahdi. Of course, as a Western film, the Mahdi is presented as a blood-thirsty psychopath, whereas he was in fact a holy and devout man who wanted to free the Islamic World from Western influence. In these days the Western powers didn't have cruise missiles and stealth bombers - they had to do their dirty work with the British bayonet, and more often than not, they paid a high price for their arrogance. This movie, however, presents a rather rosy view of colonial war. The British army effortlessly mows down the Mahdi's army as if Muslims were just so many sheep being slaughtered. When I watch this film, I feel that the West never really ended its crusades againsts the Islamic peoples."
4,"Could be better, but still a classic!","Good movie.PROS: I appreciate the lack of over-the-top stuff that was in the Heath Ledger version of a few years back. Much of the movie was relatively true to the book, and it did highlight and ridicule the precision/tradition of the British military and the nobility of being killed in battle.CONS: The blindness could have been better acted, and the last ten minutes lacked the drama I would have liked. I wish the violin music had been included! I wish the reunion of Harry and Ethne had been truer to the book, and I thought the ending was a little to cute.Overall, I am glad I own it, but it still doesn't fully satisfy. I guess no version will fully capture the beauty of the novel."
5,Best of them all,"The 1939 version of the Four Feathers is one of my all-time favorite movies. It has all the elements of a great adventure movie. The hero(Clements) must return the four feathers (a sign of cowardice) to his friends who sent them to him. His harrowing deeds of valor that he goes to are the main topic of the film, but not are all of them. It is a love story too; and shows the lengths a man will go through for love and honor."
4,I guarantee you won't be able to put this book down!,"Imagine what would happenen if your parents were killed in an auto accident? You are cleaning out the house and you find a paper in a locked drawer that tells you that you are adopted and whatever you do don't try to find out who you are. You decide to brave it and go to a PI. He wants to investiage on his own, but you show up at his motel since you are used to running your own life and now you feel the safe life you once had is destroyed.Now we are swept 30 years in the past and meet the real mother and father and we get their story by degrees. Here is where I was up until the wee hours of the morning since I had to find out what would happen next.You are getting a block buster read for a low cost by a top writer. Once you read this you will go back and order Ms. Steward's other titles. Whatever you do, if you like suspense, don't miss this fabulous book.Suzanne Coleburn"
3,lack of attention to detail and poor quality control,"While trying to bolt together ramp top, 2/8, and hook latch plate, found carriage bolts too short to accept nut. Metric bolts about 2"" long. Need 4 bolts, 2 1/2"" long. Trip to hardware solved problem, but why aren't the proper bolts included? Would appreciate including more non-skid sheets also. Worked well when moving my snow blower to the back of my Honda."
3,Arnold 8-Inch to 10-Inch Deluxe E-Z Ramp Hardware Kit,"Good product, but I was better off buying ramps. The wood will be too long to throw in the back of a pickup bed without sticking out the back. This is based on the manufacture distance for my bed height. The height for my '99 Ford F250 Super duty is standard height without any modification."
4,"Richard Burton, he hit the nail on the head.","I could never say it better than the back of the box does, so here is what it says;""RICHARD BURTON stars as Sir Winston Churchill in this epic which spans the crucial pre-war years of 1936-40. VIRGINA McKENNA gives a memorable performance as Churchill's wife Clemmie.A lone voice warning of the growing menace of Fascism. Churchill is ignored and ridiculed. He opposes Prime Minister Baldwin and supports Edward VIII in his abdication, and is howled down in Parliament. But when Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler results in the loss of much of Europe, Churchill is asked to lead the nation. BURTON gives one of the most powerful performances of his career in this richly textured and unforgettable saga.""- author unknown"
3,"Not Erotic, but sorta disturbing","Okay Now I have to say, I bought this book under the premise that this would be al sorts of sordid sexy erotic vampire stories. Instead I got a really nice anthology of all things vampires. Some sexy, others not so much. It covers your range of vampires from emotional feeding vamps, to blood suckers, to fetus eaters, to face eaters. See I don't technically count all of the characters within to be traditional vampires, but they do live off of the lives of others so I guess it works. Some of the stories are excellent, others are an authors attempt at cramming too much information into too few pages. I expected more of stories chosen by Poppy. Overall I was disappointed in this book. The stories are okay, but nothing really stuck with me except Nancy Holder's vision of Japan it's worth the price of the book. I'm getting around to the second edition and I'm hoping it's a bit more satisfying."
2,Disappointing,"Poppy Brite is a better writer than she was an editor. This book is the proof. These stories are actually quite lame, and don't do much to stimulate either the intellect or any of the other parts erotica is supposed to stimulate. Skip this one. Her follow-up book Love in Vein II is vastly superior, with a collection of well-written, and much more erotic, vampire fiction."
3,"I enjoyed many of these scary, spooky and sexy short stories","I liked to be scared and sexy at the same time, so this book was the perfect experience for me. What I liked the most was the Delicous Antique Whor and the Alchemy of the Throat, although sometimes I didn't understand them. I am scared already to think about this book! Wooo!"
5,BEAUTIFUL,"while some of the stories aren't that great.... certain ones will have you wanting more and more from the writers. I love books like this because usually i become a fan of a few of the writers in there. The book starts off very strong with the continuation of dracula... gets a little lame in the middle... and picks up speed again. MOST of the stories in here you'll love. This book is a definate pick me up... and for those of you (like me) that are a HUGE Poppy Z. Brite fan, you should try reading Love in Vein II."
2,Eh...,"I'd never read Poppy Z Brite, and this book was recommended to me. Generally, I like anthologies, but this book is a collection of hit-and-miss. Some of the stories are interesting, but many of them do not even have vampires in them, or are just so poorly written that they are hard to read (such as the last story in this collection, which is nonsensical and disjointed) Some of the stories are about psychic vampires - feeding off emotion, or sound, or whatever, but this was a plodding book to get through. I can't really recommend this as a good read - if you're curious about what is in here, I recommend borrowing it from the library or a friend first because I bought this new, and really wish I had my money back. Oh, well."
3,"Bought it for Poppy, weak read, was not impressed.","Bought it for Poppy, weak read, was not impressed."
1,OH MY GOD,"Okay, this book LOOKED good from the description. That's about all I've got. Once I started reading it, I realized that it was a collection of icky horror stories that were really more disturbing and likely to cause a nightmare than I'm comfortable with. If that's the kind of thing that you're into, then...would you like my copy?? ;-)"
2,Vampires? Yes. Erotic? Not.,"Billed as ""vampire erotica"", I am at a loss to identify the universe in which these brutal, disturbing tales would be considered ""erotic"". Certainly some of them are powerful, well-written, and full of imagery which will stick with you after you close the covers. Unfortunately, some are also poorly written, confusing, and/or just plain distasteful. Very few are 'traditional' vampire tales. None struck me as erotic. A hit-and-miss collection; I wouldn't recommend paying full price."
2,More gross than erotic.,"A few of the stories I enjoyed, but the majority of the stories in Love in Vein I found to be a little more gross than sensual or erotic. While sex is not always sexy, these stories just didn't seem to grab me. There are, however some interesting variations of vampires in the book. Still, I was a little disappointed."
1,What a mis-leading title,This was gross misleading title. I bought this book with the hopes of a compilation of vampire tales with an erotic twist. What I was presented with was maybe 4 or 5 short stories with vampire themes. The majority of the book had very little to do with vampires. Please do not waste your money.
2,Not what I expected,"I have read all of P.Z.B books and loved them all, because of the eroticism and characters. This however was not what I had hoped for. I was expecting the stories to be more similar to Brite's writing style. More modern day I guess. I guess I realized Poppy is the only ""Vampire"" author I enjoy. I am sure to a reader with varied vampire interest would really enjoy this book and it's sequel."
1,Misleading and Incredibly dull...,"I picked up this short-story collection because the cover said it was a collection of vampire erotica and because the book was edited by Poppy Z. Brite. I feel like I've been ripped off. First of all, to say that this book is a collection of vampire erotica is misleading. Aside from some rough language here and there, there is almost no erotica in this collection. This is a collection of horror stories, period. And the stories are quite dull at that. The only ones I liked were ""In this Soul of a Woman,"" by Charles de Lint; ""The Alchemy of the Throat,"" by Brian Hodge; and ""Café Endless: Spring Rain,"" by Nancy Holder. The aforementioned stories are thought provoking and horrific at the same time. The other stories simply failed to spark my interest. Poppy Z. Brite has let me down. I have the second part of the collection and am considering returning it to the bookstore. If you are in the bargain for vampire erotica, try the Ellora's Cave books."
1,Horrifying,"This book goes beyond gross, it is twisted in a sick way. These stories are not about the traditional vampire. Very few stories contained characters who actually drank blood. If you love Dracula, this book isn't for you. Actually, some of the stories were so gross, they made me want to vomit. Now I am sorry I read this book, it gave me a weak stomach for a WEEK. Save your money, this is definitely not a book you'll like."
5,Timeless guide to creating men's clothes,This is a wonderful old piece filled with great vintage men's fashions. The instructions for sewing and tailoring as as useful today as they were in the early 1970's.
3,check your CS-version !,"the confusing title ""InDesign CS"" should be ""InDesign CS (version1)"" to make clear that it's not for CS2"
4,Olympus VN-120 really delivers!,I hand out the VN 120 to my sight reading students during tests.It is very economical and durable. They will drop them ocassionally.With proper positioning the recording quality if quite good. It givesme an accurate reading of all notes and pitches.At $29 it is a great buy.TSherwood
4,Works for me,"I bought one of these to take notes in place of my miserable handwriting or paying for copying. It seems to work fine - the sound is clear enough to hear and transcribe, and it's small and handy. I didn't need bells and whistles, so I gave it a 4 out of 5 to give some space for others who need more from a recorder. The price is right, so it's hard to complain. It's going to take a while to figure out all the options and controls, but that would probably be true of any recorder. It will download to your PC if that's what you need. I'm a happy customer."
2,Was it defective?,"This recorder worked OK for the first 6 hours of recording. At that point it would shut off in the middle of the lecture and flash ""Full"" when I tried to record in another file. The erase function did not erase. I also did not like the dual function buttons, and I felt that the instructions were not as clear as they could have been. I eventually took it back and got my money back."
3,Eh,Button labeling on unit is so small they're hard to read. Wattage is just too low -- usually have to play at max volumn with bass boast just to get an average sound level in a small room.
5,The Best !! (But perhaps not for YOU....),"Howling-out-loud-funny (and a bit too much identification....) on the ways, dreams and aspirations of the Fabulous Narcissists!! This book is not, of course, for the masses (OP/Ordinary Person as Me-Me calls THEM), only for the Select Few (as IIIII call them!!)If you're Good Enough and can Understand put this one in your Personal Organizer(or have one of your Staff)rush out to get it ASAP!!!"
5,Hilarious,My friend gave me this for a BDAY gift and I immediately fell off my chair laughing. Enough About You is one of those laugh out loud books -- almost every page has a funny joke. It was a great gift.
4,my review,"Well, we thought it was fine until the motor burned out at the end of the job. We got to use the Flowtron 900 long enough to JUST finish the job. We just got it back with a new motor, lol. Glad I bought the warranty so it'll be covered for 2 years instead of 1 year. We shall see."
5,wonderful,"great for shredding leaves. Shredded 5 bags of semi-wet leaves filled to the brim in less than 1 hr! You have to stop once in a while and clear out the screen, but it is quick and easy."
1,Great until you use it,"Assembly was easy and instructions were easy to follow. Following the instructions in the book I coarse shredded the leaves and then fine shredded them. Worked great for about 20 minutes and then stopped running. There was a lot of leaf dust everywhere so I got out the compressor and cleaned the dust out of the filter, motor, and anywhere else I found it. It starts but will only run for 5 to 10 seconds before tripping the reset. I've had much better luck with equipment I buy from a discount chain (can I say HF's name here?)--I pay half as much and they are more durable. If you are willing to spend this much save your pennies a little longer and buy a real leaf/lawn vacuum. Besides chopping up the leaves it will save you from most of the raking.To be fair, the manufacturer repaired the shredder and it has worked better since the repair. I would raise the rating to three stars at this point."
4,Conservation,I an happy with the product. It sure beats hauling bags of leaves to the curb in the da rk. I simply leave the mulched leaves in a low spot in back. to add organic metter to my soil.
5,Flowtron LE 900 Electric Leaf Shredder,WOW I really like this shredder. I used to shred my leaves with a lawnmower creating all kinds of dust and being fairly ineffient. This is a wonderful product and I use the leaves on my garden and compost pile. I haven't changed the cutting lines yet but it does a very nice job of shredding leaves even as the cutting lines wear down. You have to allow one batch to get shredded before you put another shovelful in to the hopper but other than that is is a very good value oriented piece of equipment. Compare this to the price of a gasoline version which may process more but with the usual issue of gas engines and 5 times the price for the least costly. This is a winner for my hobby farm.
1,Worked great at first.,"Worked great at first. Used it for light duty mulching for two seasons. It was only used about an hour a day 3-4 days per season. Pulled it out on Saturday to use and it worked great for one day. I went to use it the following day, and before I could even load leaves into it the motor died. When not in use it was stored covered and in the garage. Will not be repurchasing."
1,total wast of money,It made it into the second year motor started sounding funny I changed the trimmer line noticed the motor shaft was very hot turned it on without the cutting line on the shaft was wobbling back and forth like the top bearing was shot 136.00 for a season and a half you decide if that is a good deal.
2,Use a bagging lawnmower instead.,"Anything other than soft dry leaves will cause the flimsy string trimmer line (the ""blade"") to break instantly. A single twig 1/4"" in diameter or a watermelon rind is enough. It doesn't work well for paper either.If you want nicely mulched leaves, use a bagging lawnmower instead. We don't even have any grass, but we use a small electric lawnmower instead to chop up our leaves/sticks/kitchen scraps/paper for composting and it works beautifully."
2,"good design, but not durable enough for my volume of leaves","I bought this unit last fall. It's light and easy to set-up and use, but after one fall it's pretty much shot. I made about 100 cuft of mulch from the leaves in my yard. In processing that many leaves I inevitably put some sticks, bark and small rocks through the unit. After that, the main body of the unit has three holes punched in it and several cracks one of which runs about one third of the way around. I'll need to get a new shredder for this fall."
2,using the flowtron mulcher,"I did not really need this item, because i was of the opinion that the leaves would be shredded more fine that it is doing now, so i have used it once, and thats it. Winston Stoute."
1,Doesn't Measure Up to Manufacturer's Claims,"This device worked, if we were very careful about not putting very many pine needles or leaves into it at a time, for about an hour. Then it died. So we returned it."
5,Albany NY area with 1/2 acre,"This product rocks! I almost felt bad when the yard was done the second time and I'd need to put it away for the winter (almost!). Yes, it is loud (wear ear and eye protection, and a mask)and the assembly is a bit awkward (took me 20 minutes -get another person to help), but in the two pases of my yard I went through 3 pairs of strings - not bad considering we have cedar, maple, oak and pine needles to deal with and there were some wet leaves in the mix (about 20%). I had it set to the second most fine mulch setting and it only became clogged when the strings were so short that the mulch accumulated on the sides (wet leaves didn't help either). Both passes of my yard took less than 4 hours each. Rake/Blow the leaves into rows and then use a snow shovel to load the leaves into the Flowtron."
4,Flowtron LE-900,"The Flowtron I purchased was somewhat difficult to put together ,as the hood/leaf collector is made of flexible plastic. I had to install some nuts and bolts to make it more rigid. When finally assembled however, it worked very well with leaves and pine needles. I had to be watchful to keep small twigs out of the leaf collection, somewhat hard to do when you are raking the yard, but with care it make quick work out of dry leaves. The nylon ""strings"" that shred the leaves do wear out quickly but are easy to replace. Shredding is far superior to dragging piles of leaves, and I can't burn due to county ordinances. The mulch produced was great for flower beds and the garden. When used with care this appears to be a good product. I have only used it for one season, and I am very interested in seeing how many years it lasts with the kind of use it had this year."
4,Still working after 4 years and leaves from 8 large trees,Simple to use and long lasting! Just make certain the leaves do not cover the motor on the bottom. It can be cleaned out but does put a delay in your day. Love being able to have finely chopped leaves for my compost pile. Speeds up the composting process and we are not contributing good material to a landfill. Wish all my neighbors used one.
1,piece of junk,"I would not recommend this product. I knew in advance that it had its limitations - just about anything will clog it and cause it to stop working. However, the motor on ours quit working shortly after we began using it. I called the company and to their credit, they mailed me a new motor. I thought to myself during that call that they seemed to really grasp the issue - almost like it was a recurring problem. Anyway, the second motor also stopped working shortly after installation. The company's warranty policy seems to be something like ""you mail it in at your expense and we will look at it."" No refunds. I've already sunk enough time and money into this product. Bottom line, maybe we got a dud - twice - but the product is junk, in my opinion. Save your money and deal with people who stand behind what they sell"
4,Good Product for my Purpose,"I have been using this pretty heavily since I got it a month ago. I got it for one pretty specialized purpose, to reduce the volumn or more precisely the bulk of oak leaves for disposal, not to make mulch. For this purpose I have found it to be easy to use, fast and effective. I use a large scoop shovel and can shread shovel fulls as fast as I can put them in using the ""coarse"" setting. I estimate I get about a 5 to 1 volumn reduction. The unit is designed to set on top of a trash barrel (I use a 42 gallon barrel) and this is a very efficient system. The trimmer nylon line needs to be changed fairly often but it is simple and quick to do. I do recommend a dust mask, eye protection and hearing protection as the dust and noise can be fairly intense. As far as longevity goes since I just started using it I am not sure but the unit is pretty lightweight not super heavy duty. But considering the money, the design and the performance I am pleased so far."
1,Used twice and no longer works,"I used this twice according to instructions and it no longer works. I specifically bought it because it had a pine needle setting, but I would not recommend it for this. I am also disappointed with the service help I have received. It is unclear to me who is reponsible to take care of the non-working product - Amazon or Flowtron."
2,Too much work,"The product was shipped on time and service from Amazon was good. The product was not easy to assemble, and appears to be cheaply made. While it eventually does what it claims to do (shred leaves), it is slow and tedious. I have to put the leaves into the machine and coax them through the grinder. I should have bought a blower/vacuum combination with a metal blade. I would have gotten a better price value for my money."
1,Top feeder part doesn't stay together. Bad design,"Total design disaster. I had no problem putting the legs on this thing, but the top circular piece refuses to stay together and in place. I spend more time repairing it(with ducktape)than I do mulching leaves. Perhaps at $53 it's a deal, but not when you pay full price (as I did). Also, be aware that getting twice as many leaves into a bag makes it very heavy and lifting the bag afterwards is difficult."
1,Flowtron review,I purchased in order to reduce amount of leaves and time to bag. This product can only handle a few leaves at a time. It is very labor intensive and takes too much time to load. You have to stop and un-clog the leaves if you put in too much. It will also not handle the small sticks that are attached to the leaves. Money would have been better spent hiring it done.
3,Does what it says it will do,"This mulcher does what is says it will do. Shreds leaves. Do not get this if you have a lot of sticks or twigs in your yard like I do. I am happy with my shredded leaves, but I wish I would have spent a little more and purchased something more versatile."
5,shredding,This machine does exactly what its name implies. No branches or twigs are welcome. The shredded leaves are fine enough to till into a garden or use for mulch without matting.
1,think about this,"we bought one of these a year ago. We have probably 40 trees in the backyard. enormous piles of leaves. year prior we had 50+ bags of leaves at the street, so we got this thing to reduce the number of bags we used. it did the job, but it went through every single cord. as i recall there were something like 25-50 cords that came with it, and the replacement cords are rather pricey. it would, however, be much better if there were some way to use weed eater cord off of a spool. That would be more cost efficient. i would not recommend this product."
5,It does the job great!,"I've used a model 800 for 25+ years. After wearing out 2 shredders in that time, I'm upgrading to the 900. I'd be lost without it.I can shred up to 30 bags of shredded leaves in a season, so it gets quite a workout. Yes, it doesn't work well when sticks get mixed in. But the string is easy to replace (cut from a large spool).I'm a 5'1"" female, so putting it on a trash can isn't a good option. Also, the can would fill up too fast. So, I have very good success putting the shredder in the middle of a large hard plastic kiddie pool. It will hold enough leaves to fill 4 33 gallon bags, about 15-20 minutes of shredding. And the slick bottom means it's real easy to drag around the yard. I use a golf club with no head to help unclog sticks and wet leaves.Hopefully, I will have as good luck with the model 900 as the previous model 800."
1,very lignt duty only,"I purchased this based on a limited trash pick up. I have large # of pine needles. This unit does a POOR job on anything larger than old, dried leaves. It's essentially a string trimmer in a box. The strings tear apart readily. It will run for one, or two hopperloads before you have to stop...unclog it.... and replace the nylon cutters.A VERY poor unit for anything other than the lighest of jobs....(the catcher works poorly as well ...poor bag seal... stuff flies all over the place... a MESS................"
2,"Monster mulcher, but twigs give it fits!","My situation: 150+ mature post oaks, 1 acre lot.My goal: get rid of the leaves as fast as possibleWhat happened: the mulcher slowed me down. My wife took a pile of leaves that was 2 to 3 times as large as my pile (she ended up with 20+ 40gal bags of leaves). She finished before I did. I would have ended up with about 5 40gal bags but if we had equal piles it would have taken me days! I spent way too much time getting the twigs out and changing out the ""weedeater cords"". I also had to wear swimming goggles and a mask because of the major amounts of dust this thing puts out.I'd only recommend this if your goal isn't the same as mine (you want to keep the mulch) and you don't have twigs to worry about. If you are just trying to get the leaves off the ground and put them in bags for the garbage truck to pick up as fast as you can, this isn't going to help you."
4,happy with the mulcher,"I read previous reviews on this product before I purchased it; consequently, it performed exactly as I expected. It wasn't quite as noisy as I feared (much like a standard weed wacker) and handled a fair amount of leaves at a time. It reduced the volume remarkably. I was careful how it was loaded (no wet leaves, no sticks at all). It was easily moved, so I located it in various spots around garden & just spread the mulch where it landed. It was in use for a couple of hours on one day & I had to change the plastic cutters twice, which I didn't think was bad, given the volume processed. I'm very pleased with it."
4,great for dry leaves,"I have mulched tons of oak leaves with this machine, and it works great, as long as the leaves are relatively dry. If they are wet, it gets gummed up. My solution has been to spread piled-up leaves out to dry in the sun before mulching them. As long as I do that first, it works fine. It has definitely saved me a lot of trouble bagging up leaves because now I just shred them and use them to mulch my flower beds and shrubs. The plants love this mulch, and it looks pretty nice, too. I don't intend to buy bagged mulch ever again."
1,worst product I ever brought,It does not go together well and does not work well. I would not by this for $10 after I found out what it can do. a piece of junk.
1,Works fine but lacks quality construction,"This machine asssembles easily and works well. Flowtron went cheap on the parts as it flimsy construction and I don't expect it to last but a couple seasons. For a few dollars more in better materials, they could have had a great machine that would last many years. The mulcher works well with oak and apple leaves. Sticks eat up the string pretty quick and often clog the machine. You are paying mostly for the idea here"
1,"Flowtron LE-900... Save your money, don't buy this","I had one of these previously, and I think it was slightly better, but maybe I just have fonder memories. I got several years out of the old one, even though I bought it used. My new one seems somehow less rugged, if that's possible, since the design isn't rugged at all. I think the spinner head has been changed and now has additional plastic parts, because I could not re-attach a metal blade I had made for my previous unit and still had. The motor is (still) under-powered, and I'm not patient enough to load leaves and things this slowly to avoid over-loading the motor and stalling it, while it's making such a racket.. Bottom line is: Look for something better."
1,Leaf Shredder/Line Eater,"I purchased this LE-900 unit one year ago and used it through one Fall Season. It will shred leaves but also eats the line rapidly. You will spend almost as much time installing new line as mulching leaves. I contacted Flowtron twice by Email about this problem and received no reply. This indicates they don't have an answer, don't care, this is OK as they sell more shredder line this way or all of the above. The problem makes the units performance unacceptable and the Customer Support from Flowtron also unacceptable. This unit does not meet the standards I have come to expect from the equipment Amazon advertises and sells."
4,Leaf Mulcher Performance,"The unit is light weight and the string blades are easily replaceable. It does indeed mulch the leaves. However, one must feed it moderately and it will do the job. Too much too fast will cause the overload switch to turn the unit off. However, that is easily reset and you can continue but with more moderate feeding to keep it going."
1,worn out after 1 1/2 years,This piece of equipment lasted one 1 and 1/2 seasons of leaf mulching! It always smelled hot when running. No amount of pressing the reset button will bring it back to life now. It runs for a few seconds and quits. I really need it this time of year. I sent an email to Flowtron about getting it repaired a week ago and haven't heard from them.I would NOT recommend this machine!Don't waste your money.
3,Works great for a short life machine,This shredder worked very nice for leaves and pine straw. Continuous use will wear the machine out pretty quick. I have a large lawn and I was able to get almost two seasons of leaves and pine straw shredding before the plastic bushings wore out. I did not purchase from Amazon and therefore paid much more for mine that Amazon's price.
2,Didn't last,"I bought my mulcher three years ago. The first year it worked fine. The second year, I did not use it, but this year which is the third, I had just began using it, and the top bearing in the motor came apart releasing its ball bearings, making a racket and eventually jamming the motor and tripping the circuit breaker. I thought it was materials in the motor but once to took it apart I saw the problem. I have only been used it on leaves; so, I must conclude that it is poorly designed. Otherwise, it worked fine when it worked."
2,leaf mulcher,"I have a half acre of leaves to mulch in a forested area at my cabin. You have to be careful about feeding it.....no small branches. I spent too much time going through the pile of leaves that I raked removing small branches, e.g. 1/4 inch diameter."
3,No 8 Amp Motors,"According to Flowtron, they use the same motor in all models of their leaf shredders and all motors have a label showing 5 amps. Flowtron says these motors increase in amps under load! Well,that would cause more heat and stress in the motor. So, there are no 8 amp motors!What do you get for paying an extra $50 for the LE-900 model? You get a stand that swivels, a small bungee cord at the bottom to hang a trash bag,and a small compartment on the side with a door on it to store extra cutting line!You might get a pair of safety goggles if your box has a ""G"" after the model #."
3,Not useful for my purposes,"I returned the Flowtron 900 because it's use is very limited. After purchasing it at the lowest price in the market, may I add, I learned from the company that it's intended primarily for ""dry"" leaves; yet on the machine itself it says finer mulching is for dry matter and coarser mulching (larger holes) meant for wet material. It seemed to me that using my own lawn mower for mulching grass was more than good enough. In my opinion, the company that produces this item should say ""precisely"" what the machine should be used for and they might add what it ""will not do well."" Sorry for this diasppointing review. I do know, however, that folks who use it to mulch Fall leaves so as to use less bags to take to the dump, are very happy with this tool."
2,"Good electric motor, but flimsy and dangerous","The funnel does not fit properly, simple as that. Motor is strong and chomps leaves, but it tends to get clogged. Your instinct is to clear the mess w/ your hand, bad idead.I would only recommend this unit for a 1/3 acre lot w/ maple or other soft leaves.Plastic ""blades"" are easy to change.You definitely need ear protection and a good dust mask to operate.I will use this item cautiously, but in hind site, I would not have bought it. Terrible w/ oak leaves.Also storage space is a hog for what it does."
1,Waste of Money - Unresponsive Customer Service,"This piece of junk lasted one small yard's worth (8 bags) before it died! No amount of pressing the reset button would bring it back to life again.All I got from Flowtron when I called to find out about how to get the warranty honored was a voice mailbox and no call back after a week and two calls.Even if you decide to risk purchasing this thing, it eats through the cutting line like it was Twizzlers. For these few bags I ended up changing the line 4 times! After other reviews' warning of this 'feature' I was very careful to follow the instructions to the letter - to no avail unfortunately.Don't waste your money on this thing. Move on."
5,great machine,I don't know how anyone could say anything bad about this tremendous leaf shredder. I had a shredder chipper that fell apart on me and I paid a lot more than the flowtron leaf shredder and didn't work as well shredding leaves. Its quick once you get use to the amount that the machine will shred easily without slowing the motor. So just turn it on - start putting in leaves - learn how much keeps the motor spinning at full speed - thats all there is to it.
4,Pine Needles,Bought this item specifically to deal with lots and lots of Ponderosa Pine needles. So far so good. It makes a fairly fine mulch/dust out of even the largest needles and even chews up the cones to some extent.
2,"bad,bad,bad.","Worked very good when first used. Very loud. Motor burned out, my have been my fault. Contacted flowtron online site, NO replacement avalable. Must by whole new unit. I bought a WORKS leaf shredder instead."
4,eating lots of leaves,"The flowtron leaf ultimate mulcher ate its way through 1/2 acre of leaves. We learned a couple of tricks.1. dont stuff in the leaves, fill it lightly, it works better and faster that way.2. immediately remove any sticks, it cant digest sticks all it does is strip them raw, gum up the works and break the cutting strings3. keep one nice stick , oh about 3/4""diam x 2ft long to stir the leaves in the bin, scraping the edges as it spins this much enhances the processWe set it on ""Fine"" and the result is a nice leaf mulch which we have been spreading under our trees and adding to our compost bin"
3,Problem with motor,"This was my second shredder from the same company. The original had a different stand that isn't great, but the machine still works well after possibly a dozen years.I then sort-of upgraded to this model. Soon after the warrantee was up I had electrical problems. The motor had a breaker the first model didn't have. I contacted a very nice lady who said I could cut out and splice the breaker wires. I did and the motor burnt out.It was out of warrantee and I went back to the old shredder which I'm happy to say is still doing fine. I don't know if all units have this problem, but it was a bummer this newer model didn't last half as long as my original shredder. The concept is great for compacting leaves for disposal or for use in gardens."
3,Could be better,"This leaf shredder is pretty light weight. The unit I received pops the breaker on the motor all the time so be prepared to either put just a few leaves in at a time or keep pressing the RESET on the motor. Maybe I just got a lemon, hope you have better luck."
1,Flowtron Shredder #LE-900,"Probably a great product in the right environment but did not work well under our conditions. We were raking leaves not off a lawn but directly under oak trees and perhaps this caused the lines to wear down almost immediately. However, the service was great and would order other products."
4,Not what I ordered,"This is the second Flowtron that I have owned, so I know its limits. It will do a great job on dry leaves, but will have a problem with sticks and wet leaves. I can use this machine for an hour or two and complete all my leaves. It is not designed to shred mountains of leaves, but small hills aren't a problem.FYI, I didn't receive the 8 Amp model that I purchased through Amazon. Instead I got the 5 Amp model, twice. Check the bottom of your device and see if it's the right one. I don't know if it the 5 Amp is so very different from the 8 Amp, I just don't like being lied to."
2,Flowtron,I was so excited about getting this product as our yard is full of trees.First 2 days using it were great.Then-stopped running.Hit the reset button-wouldn't run.Still not running.Had to hire someone to get rid of the leaves.I'm so disappointed.
3,Good Idea Made with cheap parts,Great Idea. It's too bad they didn't use quality parts instead of light weight plastic. Works on our oak leaves with small bunches dropped in.
2,Substitute For Flowtron Mulcher,"After reading all the reviews I decided to put a load of pine needles in my 30 gallon waste can and use my Black & Decker line trimmer. It worked pretty well especially as the can filled up with mulch. No expense on my part since I already have a weed eater ( Black & Decker). Now I just need to do a little refinement such as a Lid for dust and particle containment and possibly some sort of a screen at the bottom so the mulch just falls through when it gets fine enough. Something to think about before spending $ 135.00 plus shipping for something that probably doesn't work much better. In addition you don't have to do any feeding of leaves, just dump them in the barrel and wack em."
1,rubbish,"The first time i used it the plastic twines broke within 5 seconds, this was caused by small twigs being mixed up with the leaves, to be fair ? it does say the product is only to be used for leaves ! BUT when leaves fall you usually get some debris from the branches, if you don't sort this from the leaves then you will have constant problems, the idea was good but unfortunatley the product design is not man enough to do the job. $100 + thrown down the preverbally drain"
2,Low quality for the price,"The Flowtron might be a good deal for $50 or $60, but is a rip-off at the advertised price. This flimsy machine is poorly designed, cheaply made and difficult to put together (and I am well experienced at putting things together). We followed instructions and did not overload it, but it continued to shut down every 2-3 minutes which required finding the circuit breaker which is inconveniently located under the motor. The second time we used it, the spinner assembly came undone and was lost somewhere in our pile of newly clipped leaves. That ended that and we had to order new parts. That said, we were happy with the mulch which made a good addition to our compost bin and vegetable beds. However, spend a few extra bucks on a mulcher or mulching mower. The limitations of this machine are not worth the effort."
4,The ultimate mulcher,"This unit works well as a light to medium duty leaf mulcher. The processed product works well as it is shredded for a mulch, or put in a compost for a more refined mulch. Since it has trimmer line, rather than blades, twig size may be a problem, however, the lineis safer than blades..I would recommend this product."
1,Flowtron Ultimate Mulcher,"I first became aware of the poor quality of the shredder during the assembly. Cheap plastic parts that snapped together poorly, the leg bracing and its intergated adjustment knobs that wouldn't work properly. The product claims to be the ultimate shredder. Within minutes of placing a hand full of dry leaves into the unit it shut down due to an over loaded motor. After locating the circuit breaker, again another poor quality item, the unit would only work when small amounts of leaves were shreded which makes the unit almost useless. I would advise those who are thinking of buying this product to look elsewhere."
3,Too much plastic,"Parts that really take a beating are made of plastic. My shredder totally died after 2 years of rather hard use. I suppose I pushed down too hard on the material I was feeding in & broke the plastic support pieces. Anyway there was so much damage to the plastic that even the motor finally died. Couldn't be too bad though, cause I want another one. I already have a big gas Troybilt but its too much trouble to set up & run. This unit is handy to use and a snap to ""lug"" around. I just wish it was more sturdy."
3,Works but slowly,"An armfull of leaves like you would pick up to drop into a garbage can will not feed through quickly, and will need help in pushing the leaves down into it. Anyone who claims that leaves feed through as fast as they are fed must be using only one hand. That said, it does mulch the leaves well. The manual gives the diameter of the cutting line, and the length to cut the pieces to - you can pick up a spool of the proper line in any hardware store that sells string trimmers."
3,SECOND PURCHASE,"THIS IS MY SECOND PURCHASE OF THIS MACHINE. IT IS GOOD FOR LEAVES ONLY AND TO OPERATE ONE MUST HAVE PLENTY OF THE PLASTIC CORD/WIRE THAT ""GRINDS"" THE LEAVES...IT BREAKS IF IT IS OVERFILLED. MY FIRST MACHINE'S MOTOR BURNED OUT AND WAS TOO COSTLY ( AND DIFFICULT) TO REPLACE. WOULD HAVE BOUGHT A NEW MOTOR IF ONE WAS AVAILABLE. MACHINE WORKS ; IT IS AN ""OK"" SOLUTION TO MULCHING A YARD FULL OF OAK LEAVES."
2,Mulches well but won't hold up,"This device makes great mulch. But the motor did not last one season, in spite of the fact that I was careful not to put in too many leaves at one time and did not put in sticks. Flowtron should be more honest about the limitations of the motor."
1,Leaf Shredder,"I purchased mine 2 years ago, and the motor has already stopped working. I am very disappointed in how short of a time this was used and already of no use but for trash! Too expensive not to get more time out of. Don't bother wasting your money, find another one!"
3,pretty satisfied,this product does fairly good but it does not live up to what it says it will do i can chop up leaves faster using my grass trimmer put the laves inside a 30 gallon trash can cut a hole in top of the lid make sure the hole is big enough for the trimmer head to fit through top of the lid and start mulching
3,Good mulcher but needs design improvement,"I have used this for one season. The first problem is putting it together. It took at least 2 hours to get it to stay together, two sides have to pop together, but not as easy as it sounds. Then it fell apart once during use. I was disappointed that the mulcher is just a string trimmer, so you have to be careful to keep all twigs out of it or you will have to change the string... over and over. Once I got it to stay together and sorted through my leaves, it mulches great, almost to a fine powder. But this powder comes out of the sides where the bag is connected, so you do get some of the mulched leaves on the lawn. Also, very big and hard to move around. I will use it every fall, but I hope they design these flaws out of it."
3,stand needs re-engineering,The mulcher works well & it's easy to change the mulching strings. The stand must have been designed by an idiot. It doesn't need to be that hard to assemble and it falls apart easily. I set mine on a large plastic tub because the stand seperates & the whole thing falls.
5,Meets expectations,"This machine performed exactly as described. Ease of assembly: What could be easier? The only tool required is a Philips screw driver! If it is used according to instructions, it performs quite well. Keep those sticks out! It is, after all, just a weed wacker on steroids. Don't overload the hopper, give it time to digest, and all will be well. My sycamores produce alot of dust, so a dust mask is indispensible. If you want to mulch leaves, this is the product for you. If you want to grind twigs and branches, get something else. 5 stars. A quality product for the price."
5,Ultimate mulcher,"I have over 30 very lark Oak trees and a hand full of pines on my 1 acre lot and when the leafs come down, not only do I get all of mine but all of the surrounding trees too. I didn't want to spend a couple of thousand on a mulcher to pull behind my tractor, beides there are some areas I can't get into. So I bought this after reading many reviews and watching some video's. It amazed me to see it work in person and how simple it was to operate and change the strings. I am very pleased with the purchase and it will be getting a workout again in the spring."
4,Leaf Shredder - works great,"Works as advertised - especially on dry leavesI did not find it to be overly noisy or dustysimilar to an electric weed-wacker.Just do not over feed, and keep the sticks out."
3,Flowtron Mulcher-Shredder,"I was so excited when I got my flowtron shredder-mulcher, until I tried to assemble it. What a nightmare!! It took 2 people to hold the top together to put the screws in. It needs something to push the leaves down so that you don't get your fingers chopped off. It was not heavy to carry, thank goodness. It worked great on dry leaves, but when I switched it to wet leaves and tried that, it didn't work so well. I do like the fact that the ratio is 30 to 1 because I use a lot of the shredded leaves for mulchng my flower gardens."
1,"Great customer service,.. lousy product","Initially the motor didn't work and was replaced free of charge. I went to pick it up outside of Boston at their company and was pleased to meet very friendly, helpful people. Unfortunately the product itself is not worth your time. The parts have broken over and over again. I was going to once again order more parts but after realizing I would have to nearly replace the entire thing I'm instead going to order a leaf vacuum/mulcher which will end up costing less."
4,"good for mulching small piles, not meant as a large yard solution -missing parts","this device has come in quite handy for producing mulch for my gardens. we live on 1 acre of a heavily heavily wooded lot. it is not practical for large clean up jobs, in fact we finally resorted to hiring a landscape company for that. but i am able to collect some piles of dry leaves and mulch/shred them to bed down my gardens for the winter. easy to use, reliable, fine grade mulch.only problem was that the hardware did not ship in the original package... as soon as we realized it was missing we called Amazon customer service and they put us in touch with the company ASAP. We had the missing nuts and bolts shipped via FedEx within the next two days. we were very happy with the customer service in response to the issue, and if not for the missing parts this review would have been a 5."
1,Buy something else,"If you want to make a small amount of mulch for a small garden plot this thing is fit for that purpose, but it's extremely loud and will take up a lot of room in your shed. It clogs easily and the nylon string cutters need to be replaced constantly. Definitely not useful for yards that are larger than 1/16 of an acre."
1,Horrible,"Don't trust this company!!! My shredder started malfunctioning right out of the box. Motor kept stopping. Seemed like loose wire, so checked what I could see. Didn't take case apart, to avoid voiding ""warranty"". That's where the big problem began. The customer support numbers given do not work. Ended up contacting Chamber of Commerce of manufactors town. They didn't have a phone number, and they told me the address given for Flowtron was now condo's! Transferred me to the Clerk of Court's office, where I finally got a contact number. Contacted the most unpleasant woman I ever dealt with in customer support. Wouldn't honor warranty, but if I was willing to ship the shredder back AT MY OWN COST, they would look at it. Looks like I am stuck with a $150 piece of junk. DON'T TRUST THIS COMPANY!!!!!!"
2,Flowtron,"Really haven't had a lot of usage of this machine. I did use it on wetlawn clippings from my tractor bagger in hopes of making the grass clippings finer. It didn't perform real well. It could only handle a small hand full of clippings and then not to quickly as the motor would trip out and I would have to reset the switch. Not really impressed at this point. It does look like it will handle dry leaves better, but haven't tried that"
2,Not worth the time,"Machine was easy to put together, just follow the instructions. It mulches well, but the feed rate is too slow. The electric motor should be larger. I bought it because I have to bag leafs, it just takes too long to process. It compress the volume, but does not save any time."
3,Not as promised,"This unit is not as fast or as efficient as the description lets on. It does not in fact shred as fast as you can load it even though that's printed on the box. It doesn't really jam but it definitely needs time to chew on things. If you want to use the shredded leaves for mulch, the mfg recommends you shred the leaves twice; that's ridiculous."
2,Flowtron shredder works but weak,"It does what it is advertised to do, but I am on my 3rd one in 3-4 years because the motor will soon wear out if you use it year-round as I do. I'd be happy to see a more durable version."
3,Decent product,"This shredder does what it is designed to do. It's price is very reasonable, in my opinion. My greatest disappointment is that it takes significantly more time to shred a large pile of leaves than to remove them to another area via a tarpaulin. Additionally, the shredding process throws large amounts of ''leaf dust'' into the nearby air, including where the shredder feeding individual is positioned. An air filter mask, ear plugs, and a hat are suggested if one is going to shred leaves with this device, and one should plan to need a complete change of clothing and shower after using it."
4,Flowtron leaf shredder,"The shredder worked as described. I like to add shredded leaves to my gardens. The Floutron LE-900 shredder quickly reduces large piles of leaves into small manageable piles. The shredder was relatively easy to assemble but some of the screws provided did not fit the unit plus some of the pre-drilled holes had to be adjusted to complete assembly.While operating the shredder, one should definitely wear protective gear on your face - safety goggles and safety mask over your nose and mouth, cover your head, use ear plugs, and wear leather gloves. The shredder is very loud and creates a lot of flying debris and dust."
4,Timing,"Lots of trees - lots of leaves - bought leaf shreader. Reasonable. Using the Flowtron Leaf Shreader was easy. It is light weight and can be moved from place to place or over cans and bags without strain. The controls are simple: On/off and adjustments are accessible and may be used without having to second guess a decision to do so. Probably the main issue is that one must be patient when putting the shredder to continuous use, though this is natural given the size of its motor. Working too fast will shut the unit down and require resetting, the control for which is hidden away a bit. One other issue is that the elastic cord intended as a hold for bags underneath cannot be depended upon beyond what are obvious physical limits. (But who wants to press obvious?)The best thing is that it actually cuts leaves down by a considerable proportion. So, looking for leaf mulch and having the time and patience (well, not always the patience), I'm keeping it."
4,leaf shredding with the le900,"based on limited use dictated by need. the flowtron did the job i wanted with no hitches. it does seem to need relatively gentle treatment, however."
5,Bryan in Traverse City,Works great. I didn't quite get to the 11 to 1 bag ratio but probably 3-4 bags to 1. Make sure you do get a goot ventilator/mask and goggles. The dust and mold of the leaves can wreak havoc on your eyes and sinuses. Assembly was a cinch. I would recommend it without hesitation.
1,Defective,"From its first use, the circuit breaker kept tripping with each load. Had to return it to the company for repair. That process was efficient, but by the time it was returned, the leaf season was over. I assume it has been fixed, but I will not know for sure until next fall."
4,Mulcher maven,Does a good job at muching large volume of leaves for fower beds. Must be handled carefully since it is not rugged in design. Not that easy to set up since some assembly is required.
1,Leaf mulcher no match for my pile of leaves...,"I am disappointed in the leaf mulcher and I had to return it. The first day it worked great and I really reduced a huge mound of leaves I had saved from the fall and spring. However about 5 hours into the process, it stopped running and the reset button popped out. The next day my husband tried it and it would only operate for a few seconds and the reset button would again pop out. I had high hopes for it because I didn't want a huge piece of heavy equipment that was going to rip my arm off. This seemed to be the perfect light weight, easily manageable machine but alas it could not stand up to the job I needed it to do. Rita"
3,Leaf Shredder does good job,"This product does a good job with larger, thinner leaves. Not so good with thicker leaves like some oaks or magnolia. I found the assembly of this product to be a little cumbersome but I put it together by myself in about 15 minutes. Basically it is a large weed eater but it does the job I need it to do. Makes good mulch for my garden."
3,Good Performer But Compaction Claims Are Exaggerated,"We've had a good experience with the Flowtron LE-900. The unit took about 25 minutes to assemble, not too long compared to other build-it-yourself products.The unit works well as a light-duty shredder as long as you keep the sticks out, which we were able to do. Only two complaints: first, the unit burns through the plastic cutting strips pretty quickly. We had to replace the strips about every 4 bags of leaves. If you don't replace them, you have to shake the unit to make the leaves fall right into the ever-shrinking cutting zone. Second, we've only been able to achieve a 2-1 reduction in the volume of leaves after shredding - nowhere near the 11-1 reduction claimed in Amazon's ad or the 30-1 reduction claimed on the shipping box itself.Otherwise, we like the unit and will continue to use it."
3,Almost Great!!,"The idea is great. I typically have about 40+ bags of leaves and pine needles each year. If this could be ground into almost-powder and returned to the ground it would eliminate a few trips to the dump. The first time I tried this product it seemed to work great. It definitely needs heavier line (.095) AND a better center screw (it holds the spinning mechanism in place). It comes with a plastic screw which broke within an hour's use... not the easiest thing to replace. IMHO it really needs a metal screw. Then, the machine works great."
1,Wait for a mulcher with metal blades.,"I bought this machine, or its clone, at Sears a few years ago. It didn't last one season. In fact, the first time I used it a part came loose and was lost, and it took a couple of weeks for it to be shipped. It's hard to rake leaves without picking up some small twigs, and small twigs cause this machine to hangup. Someone needs to design a machine just like this, but with metal blades. Many of us don't need the larger chipper/shredders that are the only alternative."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Don't waste your money on this poorly designed product. I read other negative reviews but decided to try it anyway. What a mistake! Putting the plastic parts together was a major struggle that took two people several hours to accomplish because they didn't fit quite right. Then the first time it was used, one of the plastic parts broke and caused a chain reaction of broken parts which rendered the mulcher unuseable. Amazon: You should stop selling this piece of junk!"
1,Piece of CRAP,"This product is the biggest piece of CRAP. DO NOT purchase it. The handles did not fit properly onto the stand rendering the product useable only perched on top of a garbage can. Next, the lines kept fraying down to nothing and needed constant replacement. Within 2 days, the motor quit working.I was not using the product with anything but dried leaves - no wood or other hard items.Do yourself a favor and spend more and get a gas powered shredder with metal cutting blades. If you buy this, you get an upside down weedeater.PIECE OF CRAP!"
3,An OK Hill/Spencer movie.,"This is a good movie...it isnt bad and it isnt great....but it could have been alot better...it wasnt what i thought it would be....i suggest Watch Out were Mad, Im for the Hippopotamus, Crime Busters, and A Fistfull of Hell. These are much better terence hill and bud spencer films...."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable ...,"This is a movie chronicling a brief period in the lives of three sisters who come together to help one of them deal with a tragic situation. Their mother had commited suicide when they were growing up and that act effected each of them in very different ways. Ultimately, they realize their bond is necessary and stronger than their troubles. The movie ends with a joyful moment and will leave you smiling, happy for their reunion and the growth that came from it."
5,I'M GUILTY!,"THIS IS MY MOST FAVORITE ""southern woman's""film.the story is highly original and quite frankly edges toward insanity.and is FUN!three sisters come together on the eve of their ""grand-daddy's"" probable demise and the added urgency of the younger sister having shot her husband..a not so nice man.the other two sisters have their own problems:a failed ""b""actress [maybe c]and the older sister who has a shrunken ovary and feels rejected by men because she cannot bare children and hides in this pain...and afteral it's her birthday and no one has remembered except a really annoying cousin.the younger sister has shot her husband because he has found out her involment with a 16 year old black youth.added to this scandal is an earlier one where their mother commited suicide with the family cat because she was just having ""a bad day""!all three actresses are a joy and so is this story!"
3,bizarre,"I found this film a little bizarre. Even though many of the words were familiar, the over-all effect was one of disassociation from the Pulitzer prize winning play.It seems impossible that the two could have been written by the same person. Characters merely mentioned in passing in the play become major characters in new scenes, new locations, etc in the film. The result is a wonderful play fractured beyond redemption in this film.Diane Keaton flailed and shouted, bounced from furniture to wall and back again like a hopped-up long haul truck driver. What's that about? It's certainly not the character she was hired to play. It was funny,really. Bad funny. You could actually see Jessica Lang, Cissy Spacek and Sam Shepard recoil from her, with a ""whats she going to do next?"" quizzical look on their faces. And the music score was just wrong, wrong, wrong.Other than that, I loved this movie. :)"
4,Three Strong Actresses,"These three actresses make what is a mediocre script come alive and worth watching. It's interesting to read the readers' reviews and see who picks out their favorires among the three. For my money, it's Diane Keaton and Jessica Lange tied, with Sissy Spacek coming in third. Sam Shepard, although in a small role, helps a lot.The script is a bit dated and some may be tired of the same old Southern cliches, but all in all, it's a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. The final scene with the birthday cake is worth the price of the film. I have the hunch that Keaton ad-libbed with the size of the slices, which produced a wonderful last shot."
4,Almost perfect,"This blade performed as expected. I ripped several pieces of 5/4 cherry for glue-up to make table legs and found no visible glue lines. The ripping operation was a little slower than I would have liked which I believe was due to the lack of blade coating I'm used to on other Freud blades that I use. Other than that, the blade is worth buying."
2,very dissapointed,"Freud LM74M010 10-Inch 30 Tooth TCG Glue Line Ripping Saw Blade with 5/8-Inch Arbor and PermaShield CoatingAfter reading all of the reviews for this blade I was very impressed with the recommendations of those who used it. I had been contemplating purchasing the Forrest blade as I do a lot of hardwood glue ups in my particular woodworking projects. When I received the blade I was anxious to see if I could really eliminate some of the use of my jointer, and boy was I shocked. I found the blade to give a much much rougher cut than my cheaper Avanti combination blade (which sometimes gives a gluable cut). Not only was it a rough cut (saw marks) but was considerably slower than my combination blade. I tried the blade on hickory, poplar, cherry, walnut and oak with the same result on all of them.I would like to think that I got a hold of a defective blade, but I'll never know, as I sent the blade back immediately and will not order another Freud blade."
2,Not worth the money,Here's the breakdown:Positive:1) Quiet2) No vibration3) Fast rippingNegative:1) Saw marks visible (My combination blade rip smoother)2) Over price
5,"Super bright, long battery life","Best flashlight, better and brighter than a 4d cell mag-light! The batteries also last a lot longer than a AA mag light. This has to be the best flashlight for the size and price."
5,Best Flashlight I've had,"I've been using mag-lights for years. These are at least twice as expensive, but they are 10 times better! Maglight doesn't even compare!! I've had mine for two days and I've dropped it from a 6 ft ladder in water, it has fallen off a boiler (5 ft high), and I use it all the time but it doesn't seem to have dimmed or fluttered like the maglights. I highly recommend this flashlight!"
5,Awesome stereo,"Just installed one in my car - bought it on closeout at Fry's for under 50 bucks. Has many features that you can't find in other stereos for even 100 dollars, such as speed sensitive volume control and a huge color selection for backlighting. Best of all, the controls are big enough to operate while driving - unlike other companies, Blaupunkt didn't cram 200 buttons onto the front plate."
4,"Fascinating guide, but meant for group study.","This is a study guide, and it teaches through essays, followed by questions. The subjects are thought-provoking, and are presented in a preview/questions/review-and-explanation format. The writing is thought-provoking: How, one is asked, has God spoken to you, personally? Faith is presented as a process, one which is life-long. This book is not meant for a solitary reader, it is meant to be taught to a group which is guided by an educated director. Also, it is meant to cover certain basic doctrines, not to be a complete catechism. I wish I could find a class with whom I could share this book. It is a good experience when read alone, but it would be greatly enhanced by group discussion and sharing of thoughts."
5,Greatest Phone,"I own two of these phones. Make and receive reliable calls as long as you have signal, less than 1 bar, sometimes as long as it indicates service and no bars. The best. Infrared and Blue Tooth don't hurt either. Very configurable to use as you would like. Works with Centennial Wireless, Cingular, Dobson, CBW, WWC, T-Mobile, Petrocom, Cor, Comnet, Triton, and more."
3,Decent Phone...,"Phone is pretty good - does everything you need, and phone signal, bluetooth, and IR are good. However, two things stopped me from giving it 4 stars:1) Camera is a joke, even for camera phones.2) Screen resolution is mediocre.However, on a purely practical level (i.e., how does it work as a phone), it works like a charm."
5,Nice Live Version,"I bought this in debate how good it was live. It's the first time I heard Poison Live and I will say it sounds amazing great, with the crowd in the background. Every Rose has a thorn has the crowd sing along. This CD is amazing and if you can get your hands on any other Live Poison disk, I would highly recommended it."
2,Didn't last long,"Considering this blade sells at a premium, it sure didn't last long when i was doing a laminate floor using Pergo. The room that I floored was about 300 sq ft. About halfway through the blade was just burning through the panels, it wasn't even cutting anymore."
5,the black man who haunts your dreams and my distant memories,"I am a marathoner. Halfway down the path a man named Leon appeared in my mind. I've seen him time and again on mountainsides. He whispered to me the news of great joy, and I found myself the winner. Your marathoner's party and your dreams are my life, you bastards, my very life."
3,A trio of fine performances!,"Distilling Durrell's complex novel was an impossible task, as Cukor's attempt shows. The renowned Hollywoood director inherited the project from Joseph Strick. Not quite the unmitigated disaster some critics claim it to be. Anouk Aimee is beautiful to look at, but it is the triad of Dirk Bogarde, Philippe Noiret and Anna Karina which stands out. Karina is especially touching as the doomed bellydancer Melissa--a performance overlooked by Oscar voters in 1968!"
3,argh! no don't!,"ok it was an almost impossible task to reduce the brilliant quartet to the screen, but this was just so disappointing. more than anything, it felt, well, cold and claustrophobic. END"
5,The Grapes of Wrath,"As directed by the brilliant John Ford, this movie is poetry. With Henry Fonda giving the performance of his career as Tom Joad, and actress Jane Darwell winning an Oscar for her brilliant portrayal of Tom's beleaguered mother. It is a movie that speaks to the indomitable nature of the human spirit."
3,5 star movie -- up until the last 60 seconds.,"This movie was almost worthy of the book, and was deserving of 5 stars, until the last 60 seconds. Then Ma Joad gives her ""We're the people"" speech (which ends something like ""We're the people, and the people keep a'goin'"" or ""We're the people, and the people keep on"" or something like that). Then the music track swells inspiringly, and the film ends on an upbeat note.HUH? Grapes of Wrath was NOT an upbeat book. The story was one of despair, and at the end of the book the Joads were in very dire straights indeed -- no money, no food, no shelter, and Tom on the lam from the law. The ending of the movie -- which other Amazon reviewers have inexplicably praised -- completely distorted Steinbeck's message."
1,Advertised special features where not on the DVD,"I bought this item primarily because of the special features which were described in the blurb regarding this product; unfortunately most of these special features were missing from the DVD I received. I cannot remember what all the special features were; but, I do remember that the DVD was to contain newsreel footage from the 1930s regarding the dust bowl and other filmed materials from he 1930s which chronicled the events on which John Steinbeck based his novel. I ended up returning the DVD"
3,Better than Steinbeck,"John Ford actually improved on the extremely overrated Steinbeck novel, ""The Grapes of Wrath."" But that isn't saying much. Greg Toland, once again, deserves much of the credit for the visual impact of the film. Ford contributed his usual unbearable sentimentality (sentimentality defined as ""unearned emotion""). Henry Fonda gave his usual authenticity to an already melodramatic script. In 1940 there was a gap between Film and reality so great, it would take a De Sica to bridge it. Alas, we had no De Sica. All we had was Ford (i.e., ""Found On the Road Dead"")."
1,the grapes of wrath,the dvd received in The Grapes of Wrath was most unsatisfactory as it jumped and jammed - please acknowledge this comment as I have already sent this email to you. Susan Smith I don't understand as I sent a most unsatisfactory review please reply to my comments
3,WONDERFUL MOVIE AND GREAT ACTING,I ABSIOLUTELY LOVE THE MOVIE BECAUSEM ITS AN AMERICAN CLASSIC. THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS DISC IS THAT PART OF THE MOVIE IS UNVIEWABLE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE MOVIE STOPS AND STARTS AND HAD TO FAST FORWARD TIO SEE REST OF MOVIE. I WOULD LIKE THIS DVD REPLACED AND WILL SEND THE DEFECTIVE DVD BACK TO YOU. I AM STILL VERTY SATISFIED WITH MOVIE MARS AND THIER PRODUCT. AND I WOULD STILL RECOMMEND THAT THIS MOVUIE BE REQUIRED VIEWING.
3,Some powerful moments offset by others which suffer the heavy hand of polemics,"Fine performances and gorgeous cinematography. Some powerful moments offset by others in which the heavy hand of polemics destroys the credibility of the scene. Illustrated the casual generosity of people sharing hard times contrasted with the casual cruelty and brutality of those in positions of authority - with an apparent fear of losing their precarious stability and relative prosperity driving much of the cruelty and brutality.It's a beautiful film to watch with especially strong performances especially from John Carradine, Jane Darwell, and Henry Fonda."
4,dvd purchase review,I was very pleased with this purchase. It was delivered in a timely fashion and the dvd quality was amazing bc my brother and i watched the dvd over holiday break!
4,Love The Cinematography,"""The Grapes Of Wrath"" is an interesting, beautifully-filmed, powerful movie, despite being marred by obvious political bias.With the fabulous black-and-white contrasts here, I wish John Ford had directed a bunch of film noirs because this sure has the feel of one. This is just great photography and camera angles.Henry Fonda is the lead character and does a fine job as usual but Jane Darwell steals the show as the matriarch of the family. John Carradine almost does the same with his ex-preacher role. The scenes of the family all piled on this old jalopy is one that will stay with you."
2,"would have loved to see it, but my disk is bad","right about the time they arrive in california, the picture pixates and i just end up fast forwarding it for the next 10 minutes, ruined the whole movie for me."
2,The Grapes of Wrath,"Although this item was rated as ''good as new"" in fact several of the CDs were so damaged that they could not be listened to."
2,Far short of the book,Steinbeck's book is a superb piece of literature. It presents characters who are full of life and a story that needed to be told. The movie falls short on every front. Scene after scene is ignored or changed beyond recognition. The movie is an embarrassment to the book. Suggest you read the book and skip the movie.
2,"Depressing,Pointless and ends on unrealistic Hopelessness!","I just watched Grapes Of Wrath last night,and I think it is highly overrated!Watching the Joad family suffer through one miserable experience after another and especially to end with such a tone of hopelessness was not a good film experience.I just see no redeeming quality in this film.If our country was so hopeless as portrayed in this film,then I would not have enjoyed the childhood that I did,being born in 1950!I gave it two stars only for the stark portrayal of the inhumanity of corporate farms/corporate greed,and how migrant workers are treated to this day!A film full of misery and injustice,for lovers of 'downers' only."
2,"A big yawn. Another overrated ""classic"".","For years I heard what a magnificent film THE GRAPES OF WRATH was. Perhaps the build-up was too much, and I expected a masterpiece. It isn't. Fonda and Jane Darwell give good performances, but the film feels wooden and dull most of the time.Fox's presentation also leaves something to be desired. The print is not up to the kind of restoration a film with this reputation would seem to warrant. Further, the extras are pitiful for what is supposed to be a ""special edition"". A particularly banal and recycled A&E biography is supposed to be the highlight. The ""expert"" commentary is by a film historian who gets his facts wrong. (In discussing Henry Fonda's lost Oscar to James Stewart, he says that Stewart lost the year before to Clark Gable in GWTW, when in fact Stewart lost to Robert Donat). You'd think an authoritative commentator would do his homework!I'm sorry I wasted my money on this one."
2,Shameless communist propaganda,"I rarely write movie reviews, but I was so appalled by the insidious nature of this film and I felt compelled to write something, albeit brief.This film is a thinly-veiled, trite, shameless communist propaganda piece presented as a folksy yarn about economic hardship in 1930's Depression-era America. Hopefully, now, 70 years later, people no longer fall for such communist nonsense.Propaganda aside, this movie is unrealistic in the extreme, as a poor family makes a 1000-mile-plus journey from Oklahoma to California in an old jalopy truck that looks like it couldn't make a 100-mile trip, let alone a 1000-mile trip."
1,Grapes of Wrath,"Did hollywood really believe it could take a John Steinbech novel and turn it into a propaganda tool for socialism? Not quite. Having seen this film forty years ago, my recolection was a family of the dust bowl 1930's coping with the harsh realities of a changing deprssion era time.Small family against big banking; david against goliath. The most graphic and telling sequence is when the evangeliquel government agent appears just as thejoad's truck quits working. The Joad's now have to coast their disabled truck to the lights that turn out to be a US Department of Agriculture ""sanitary unit #4"".This film was made at the time, before the second world war and after FDR's welfare state programs. It is a reaffirmation of a program that has ensnared millions of people then, as well as now."
1,The Wrath of Grapes,"I could not understand this movie. No starships, no capt kirk, no klingons, just old people in an old movie. By the way, there are NO GRAPES in this movie!!!!!! Now 'Wrath of KaHn', THAT WAS A MOVIE!!!! Still, I liked the part where there wuz some drinkin.....and that is my ekspert opinion."
1,Overrated,"First, the title is very misleading. There are no grapes to be found in this movie. Beyond that, it's just a very depressing movie. They could have at least given it a happier ending to redeem all the drudgery that goes on for what seems like eternity. And I'm not a historian or anything, but did a ""dust bowl"" really exist?? Buy this movie if you if you like to be depressed, but otherwise stay clear and get something like Police Academy instead."
5,Grapes of Wrath,"Made in 1940, this is a timeless classic. Documents hardships faced during te Oklahoma dust bowl. Its an emotional, gut wrenching story. Directed by John Ford and starring Henry Fonda at his best. If you like good movies, this one is a ""gotta see!"
4,A TRUE STORY AND TRIBUTE TO THE GREAT DEPRESSION!,"My father lived this story in real life. He too has seen the video and rates it very high on accuracy. My father is 78 years old and one of the few remaining OKIES left from the GREAT DEPRESSION. Every time he sees the movie ""THE GRAPES OF WRATH"" he starts to cry, because he lived the hard ship and pain of losing his home and being hungry for lack of food or money to buy any. This movie is one of the great treasures of our history!!!"
2,Poor quality of the DVD,"The recording was fine, but the DVD stopped in the middle of the show and wouldn't go past that point. Rather than spend more money to send the DVD back, I limited my loss and watched only half of the movie."
1,Beware of defective DVDs!,"I ordered this DVD from Amazon and received a defective copy. There were small pockmarks on the outer edge of the DVD which prevented viewing some of the latter scenes of the movie. I sent this DVD back and got a replacement with the same problem! I sent that back and got a refund. Beware, there appears to be a common manufacturing defect with this particular version of the movie."
1,cheap is not better,Poor quality disc's. These cheap classic's are made on cheap DVD disc's and have defects from the manufactures process. I have returned two of them so far and and am hoping this is a fluke and not the 'norm'.
1,My DVD Bad Too,My DVD did not play either. The movie played fine until about 2/3rds of the way through and then it began to break up and finally froze.
1,grapes of wrath,i ordered this twice and both dvds had problems breaking up and stopping i tried 2 different dvd players and two pc and they both did the same.i dont want dvds like this.
1,Disc is DEFECTIVE...,"This is a review for the actual disc not the film. This disc is defective and will not play the full film. The first hour plays fine, but after that the disc freezes and/or jumps to much later scenes. There were marks (like scratches) along the outside of the disc when package was opened. All ""tricks"" to get a defective disc to play do not work (e.g., cleaning with alcohol, toothpaste). Save your money and DO NOT BUY THIS DISC. There are many other reviewers who have had this same problem so please be wary of purchasing this disc. It's too bad the disc doesn't work because the film itself is wonderful."
4,Classic,This is a classic story (and a long one) like we no longer make in modern cinema. Brush up on your film history. Read the book and see how they adapted it into this film. It's a heart wrenching story of a family seeking a new life and follows the tragedies that occur to them under various corrupt systems. They make massive sacrifices for each other. Watch it.
5,"Fictional portrayal of ""Okies"" during Great Depression","This movie is a retelling of the John Steinbeck book, telling the hardships of people who have lost everything and are trying to survive. A reminder for those of us who do not know what the United States was like before govenment programs to assist those who are in greatest need."
4,Determination,"I've wanted to see this film for many years and I must say I enjoyed it very much. I am a Californian and my late wife was from Oklahoma so I am somewhat familiar with the story. We have made that trip between the two states several times and I'm very surprised that old truck,with the load it carried and those worn-out tires, did."
4,Unsure,"The recording is exactly what I needed, but I am unsure if this is a legal copy of a copyrighted work."
4,Simple review..,Lets keep it simple...shall we...Movie is not as good as the book...but it is good...most movies are not as good as the book.
2,The Grapes of Wrath,We were not satisfied with this film. There is a defect in the middle of the movie. It pixelizes about 10-15 minutes making it very difficult to understand and watch. The remainder of the movie is good. Would very much like to have it replaced.
5,* amazing interpretation *,fabulous rendition of bach's solo sonatas and partitas played on the viola! this recording captures the very essence of bach.
4,response to the VIEWER from Deluth,"You can't compare this film to THe WALL. Here is my opinion(if u want it). People who are born from the 1980's on should NEVER compare a film they just recently watched from today's standards. The WALL was a film concerning a band member who was mentally ill and abused by his parents. Mantis in Lace (however)is a time period picture. You(as the saying goes) had to be there in the 60's experimenting with LSD and drugs (San Francisco/Haight Astbury area). In order to appreciate the fullness of the film. The two films are completely different! I, on the otherhand enjoyed this film. Hilarious, entertaining and very similar to Jack Nicholson's THE TRIP. Mantis is no better then The WALL. Both films are good but come from different decades."
3,Freak out baby!!!! Yeah!!!!!,"Slow, repetitive, bland, uninteresting - I would use these words to discribe this film, but when you include Technicolor pcyhadelic LSD flip-outs where the ""tripee"" imagines the heads of men are watermelons and then promtly lops them off, we've got to be onto some kind of a winner!!!! This is the coolest LSD film ever made, bar maybe PSYCHED BY THE 4D WITCH, for the sheer fact that it could actually induce acid flashbacks, even for those who have never partaken of said substance. However, I wouldn't like to be on any form of Lysergic whilst viewing this monstrosity!! Also, some rather excellent frugging is in evidence throughout, also in said glaring Technicolor, as well as some pretty hideous sex scenes. Oh, and then there's that annoying theme song!!!"
3,Something WEIRD!,"3 stars for Mantis In Lace,4 for the rest of the disc. Lila! Get use to that tune,it'll probably stick with you forever. Every previous review has told all there is to know.I actually think the two cops are the best actors of the crew.I watched it once,it took two attempts;got very bored and put it on pause. Watched it again and it grew on me. I'll have to be in a very strange mood to watch it again.The extras are the good stuff. I think the cage girl is the original pole-dancer! The LSD film by the Inglewood cops is interesting,but the birth-defects pics ruined a very good..uh,mood.My review is all over the place,but then again,so is this disc."
3,Hard to swallow,"I had high hopes for this book. But half way through, Ms. Hill becomes unbelievable. She wants us to believe she fought hard to keep her name out of the situation when Thomas was nominated, then she turns around and wants us to belive she fought just as hard to testify! Alot of the book was dry reading...legal talk. Despite it all, I DO believe her."
5,Insightful and Rare,The Republicans and other Conservatives who tired to destroy and assasinate the person of Anita Hill were unsuccessful. I found this book to be very deep and profound and allowed my to get to know Prof. Hill. Looking back at the the Hill-Thomas affair is now interesting....it had nothing to do with truth. It was pure partisan politics and nothing more. Unfortunately Prof. Hill was caught in that war and unfortunately America has a man of very low character sitting on its highest of courts.
3,Spin-doctoring of the highest level,"Ms. Hill certainly can spin a tale. It's interesting tocontrast Anita Hill in 1997 to the Anita Hill we were presented backin 1991.Is this the same Anita Hill who told the Judiciary Committee that her only motivation was to tell the truth, and that she would not profit financially from the Clarence Thomas situation? She also categorically denied that she would profit from any book deals.Fast forward to 1997. Anita Hill has this book on shelf and another in the works. She commands speaking fees in the thousands per speech. What does this say about her credibility? Perhaps ""Speaking Truth to Power"" should be reclassified as fiction."
2,I cannot recommend,"I bought these things a while ago to use for a couple of different campaigns because we had no miniatures.Frankly, they suck. They are little pieces of cardboard (with admittedly very good artwork), but they don't function well in place of miniatures, and that is quite literally what they are intended for.The breeze from a nearby shutting door will scatter these flimsy little things. If they had plastic stands, they'd be fine. I even tried hardened chewing gum, but nothing worked.Don't waste your money; instead, just buy the plastic pre-painted mini's (which weren't available when I bought this)."
1,Another inferior geological thriller,"While not the worst book I ever read, this one comes close. The author, Earl Blinkhorn, does not have a good grasp of grammar, and apparently no editor or even literate friend provided him with any assistance. The very first sentence sets the ungrammatical tone: ""Loren and Paul were just recounting when their adventure that began those many years ago now."" It does not improve. Another large problem is his use of earthquake and volcanism data. He just dumps it into the text instead of integrating it. It is frequently unclear what relationship the geologic factoids are intended to have to the plot. He also needlessly repeats the data dumps. On dialogue he does do a better job than some, notably he handles it better than David Golemon did in <u>Ancients</u>, another geological thriller. The plot itself is ungainly with a supreme naiveté about government agencies and how they operate."
2,How greedy can you get???/,"I have to agree with the other reviewer that said this book and its character Jane were very unlikeable. Does she not have any common sense at all? The things she will do without even thinking about consequences are ridiculous, she is not even concerned by the fact that MOG can get into her house and write on her body when she is asleep...HMMM, can we say 'stupid'? Also rape is used against her and she apparently comes through it with no mental or even physical injury even though the writer of this book portrayed the man as brutal, I find that very upsetting and it downplays a horrible act. I have ususlly enjoyed the books by Layman but I think I wasted my money with this one."
4,Don't think... read!,"This is a thick book. I finished it in less than a week. Don't do alot of rational thinking while reading this book. Just enjoy a roller coaster ride and let it happen. This book moves fast. Real fast! It's just fun. Don't try to think about the ""why"" and ""how"" of things.... go with it!"
5,I couldn't put it down!,"This was my first Laymon book. I went into this not expecting much. I am an avid reader, so I felt ""what could be different about this book""? I was surprised. It grabbed me from the first chapter and I just had to keep reading it.I thought it was amazing. I would say it is more of a thriller than a horror, so anyone who isn't into horror will still like this book.I can't wait to read more from this author."
4,This girl is nuts!,"The premise of the story has been described by others so no need to go over that. What I would say is this girl really lacks any common sense but yet if she had some, there wouldn't be this crazy-ass story to tell. There are lots of holes in the story that make it completely unbelievable such as how MOG always gets into her apartment and writes or carves messages onto her body without her waking up. Nevertheless, the book was a fast-paced thrill ride if you're willing to go with the flow and not question the reasonability of it all. It's got the same style and leading bad girl type character as the few other books I've read by Richard Laymon, but that's what I love about them. Can't wait until my next!"
4,Held Captive by a Game,"This is my first Laymon book, and at the beginning I was not impressed because the dialogue between Jane and Brace was too contrived - a little too childish, not realistic. I thought, if this book is going to continue like this, I can't read it. However, once Jane got involved in playing the game, it became a matter of overlooking some of the dialogue and actually following the storyline. It was a good story, one which makes you think. Just how far are people willing to go for money? And where do they draw the line? All in all I have to give this book a four rating as I did end up enjoying it. The deeper Jane got into the game, the faster paced the action became, and the harder the book was to put down. I believe I will read other books by this author in the future."
3,"Good start, blah ending","I agree with many other reviewers. The core idea of this book is brilliant but it gets lost around the introduction of the house of S&M.; I know Laymon has built a career around fast-paced fantastic premises, but this one goes a little too far. And, I am really tired of the fact that at least one female character is raped in every book. Worse is the fact that these women walk around afterwards without any emotional scars at all. I wonder if Laymon had any anger issues with women.Still his books are compelling reads and often overcome the lack of believable characterizartion. Search out the much rarer ""Funland"" if you want to see Laymon at the top of his game."
4,Excelltent but a bit disturbing,Although a fairly long book i read this in no time. A real good read but i found myself shuddering at a certian part which involes deranged hostage cannabils. It has a good twist at the end making it a all round good read from the master Richard Laymon.
5,Terrific page turner,I could not put this book down.I read all 500 pages in 3 days.I have never been so hooked.I look forward to reading some of his other books.
3,fast and frightning...but somethings missing,"I like Laymon. His novels are always about a fast start, thin caracters, blood and [breasts]. There is nothing wrong with that, if your in the mood for it. But IN THE DARK was missing something. Why?Why did M.O.G. pick Jane to do his bidding? Jane gets picked for a game where each time the stakes go higher, with the cash payoff. Fine, a great way to continously introduce us to new discriptions of horror. But the end, well...why was Jane picked? It doesnt say.I would have liked to know a few more things about the novel, games, caracters, but the end seemed all horror, no answers. Great for some books, when you already know the answers. But you go into the finish wanting to find out who M.O.G. is, and you never fully do."
3,My least favortie Laymon so far...,"I'll spare you and my fingers the synopsis, you know it...This one just drags...and drags...and I really dislike the main character, she's kind of a nerdy little twit in my opinion. Perhaps thats why I had trouble reading the book, I really could care less what happened to her.But then suddenly in the last third of the book, she grows a brain and all hell breaks loose, Laymon style. There is some really twisted stuff towards the end. And maybe its just my imagination but perhaps a possible Beast House connection?So as a whole, the book turned out to be OK. Not great, but they can't all be favorites, can they?"
4,So great...but the ending sucks,"I really liked this book. It went at a breakneck pace--and that's what I'm looking for in my horror. But the ending was such a letdown. It was really rushed and I expected a more detailed explanation about MOG and the purpose of the game. I mean...that's the entire premise of the book, and then to not explain it--it's a big disappointment."
1,Well ..... ?,"The idea is good - admitted. But there is the problem of getting it into a novel. All the characters lack credibility, their motivations are not logical. The main character's tasks are ludicrous and the atmosphere is created in a cheap way - a way that the author thinks is traditional for the genre. The plot is improbable - which would be understandable for a horror novel -, but unmotivated and does not have anything to do with the main action. In addition it is a mixture of gore and porn, no I am not prude, but too much is too much. After finishing the novel I asked myself why I read it to the end. It could have been such a nice story. How far does a person go to get rich? There is a lot of power in this question. But in this book it is dealt with in such an absurd way that you do not answer it any more."
1,First & Last,"This was my first & last Laymon novel. The concept is great but his characters ruin the otherwise fast plot. Jane, the protagonist, is a flat character who who is hard to like. Greed is the only thing that drives her. She runs into the situations set up by Mog without a care or worry, even though her life is a risk every time. Then she shows no signs of stress or depression or guilt afterward. She is a charicature of a woman the likes found in Friday the 13th movies: totally unbelievable.I must admit the plot was fast and kept the suspence high, but the ending was a complete let down."
4,Not Bad,"This novel, 500 pages, was still a good fast read. i thought that the beginning was a little slow going and boring. but once you got past the first half of the book the action became more intense and dark. Laymon does have a great imagination thatll keep you reading, even if your not that big a fan of his, just so you can see where he takes you. Not bad."
4,"Great read, but the ending left me cold.","As stated, I loved the book. It kept me reading non-stop. The book makes you think you might know who MOG is several times, but you just cant figure it out. Without giving anything away, the plot is tight, the action keeps coming, but, I have to say, the ending left me cold. (Little spoiler coming here) But you never do find out what or who MOG is,,,its maddening! I had hoped to learn why he is what he is and why he does what he does, but you dont. Other than that,,,read it, its worth your time."
5,Among the best of Laymon's work,"Having read 7 Laymon novels (I realize he has 40) I was captivated from the first chapter until the last. I read this in 3 days and it was hard to put down each night. I can honestly say I had a smile on my face for most of the book... it's that much fun. Granted, it might offend a lot of people with it's graphic descriptions and adult scenes, but if it's horror you want, it's horror you will get. Laymon doesn't ramble on and on like Stephen King. He gets right to the point and brings on the violence and suspense."
5,The best book I've read.,When I started to read the book it was for a book reading contest. The beginning was a little dull and hard to understand but the more you read the more you get into the story. If you like Horse books or adventure stories this is the book for you!When I find this book I will definatly buy it
5,Excellent math program for concepts and reinforcement!,"I think the Box it or Bag it program is excellent for primary math classrooms K-2! If you like a hands-on concept approach to math with lots of fun ways to practice and reinforce a concept then this book is for you. I am not sure what the previous reviewer meant, but this is not a book program for children. You make up all of the math concept games from the papers provided and place them in colorful contact paper covered boxes. Then you pull the games out to practice concepts. The 2 teacher guides are to give you activities to teach the concepts and seasonal activities to bring mathematics into your classroom. This is not a program where children will be filling out workbooks, it is a hands on approach, and children are very actively working on what they are learning. It goes very well with the Mathematics Their Way philosophy and techniques."
1,About this book set,"It Bag It Mathematics/ Complete Set/Bdtt, ""This book set consists two text books and ten booklets bound many sheet, first text books are for teachers and last booklets are for students,respectively. The field is concerned two math., one of it is for kindergarten and another one of it is for the 1st and 2nd gradeof elementary school.Remark: This book set is not concerned bag theory in the field of mathematics."
1,I don't like these people!,"This was my first Bradford book, picked up in the airport to shorten the fly time. The description hinted at some mystery and intrigue, where my true reading interests lie, so I took the bait. I was sorely disappointed, and regret spending the $8.00. It's only saving grace is that it is a quick read, although if I hadn't been flying, I don't expect I would have finished it. The characters were extremely shallow and self-involved, with inconsistencies in their actions that I could not overlook. The plot was very disconnected, and the twists it took seemed very arbitrary and unrelated to what had preceded in the story. I thought perhaps I just did not appreciate this author's style -- I'm glad to see my opinion is not unique among others who have submitted their review. Not a book I will recommend."
1,The most BORING book ever!!,"I find it very hard to believe this was on the bestseller list. I have never read a more boring book in my life!! Luckily, I picked this up at the library, so at least I didn't waste any money on it, just my time."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!,"There should be an option for no stars!!!!!!!!!I love the comment from the reader in New York; I said the same thing ""What uppercrust child calls their mother Ma"" PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!SAVE YOUR MONEY! This book has no beginning, middle or end.WHAT A LET DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,WHAT IS THIS???,"This is absolutely one of the worst books I've ever read. I can't help wondering what the publisher was thinking about when putting the book to print. And this is an author of a dozen other books? I will remember her name and never EVER to read any of her books again. There is no story, no theme, no reasonable buildup of climax. What a birdbrain product."
5,Good book!,"I am a sixth grader and read this for school. It was good because it was sad, happy and all around interesting. My favorite character was Steve Ferris amd Amigo. I definitely recommend this book to other readers."
5,Suit Saver works GREAT. Love it.,I am an avid pool swimmer and my designer swimwear used to get destroyed so fast that I started wearing cheap suits that didn't really look that good on me. Then I heard about Suit Saver through a friend. It really works. No more chlorine smell and my swimsuit stays in good condition for a long time. Love this product. It really works.
2,So teensy tiny,And I didn't really feel it thoroughly washed the suits or even took out the scent of chlorine. I would not buy this again.
3,suit saver,I ordered this product on advice of my swimming instructor however I didn't realize it was such a small amount for the money. I have use it and it does work as there is no chlorine odor in my swim suite after using the suit saver. If you swim in a pool with chlorine a lot I think you would need a larger bottle.
5,One of Hemingway’s masterpieces,The Sun Also Rises is one of the books that brought acknowledgement to Ernst Hemingway as one of the most talented writers of the twentieth century. With is unique clear and concise writing style he manages to create characters that are first of all realistic and therefore easy to identify with.
2,They bend. All the time.,"Looking at these kingpins? Chances are, yours bent. It's a well-known flaw that the kingpins on Traxxas 2WDs bend all day long. So don't just get more; they'll bend too! What you really need are aluminum caster blocks,Traxxas 3632A Aluminum Caster Blocks Anodized - Blue. They've done the trick for me and countless others. Nice thing is, they come with screw-in kingpins so won't have to fiddle around with annoying e-clips ever again."
5,Excellent book! Information is well presented.,"Being an owner of Pygmy goats I have found information as well as veteranarians well-versed in pygmy goat health to be very limited. This book has been a life saver to me on more then one occasion. My dog-earred copy is in my barn, and I refer to it often. I encourage anyone and everyone who owns exotic pygmy goats to purchase a copy of this book. It will pay for itself many times over!"
2,Colors come off.,"As other reviews warned me, the colors come off when you wash the placemat. I thought a placemat would help with dinnertime mess, but since I'm washing the placemat AND the table now, it's really no help so we're no longer bothering to use it."
2,good choice,"its very useful, while waiting for their meal, they have a chance to practice either animals names or the numbers."
3,Attention grabbing but Scratchable,"I like these mats immensely. While sitting waiting for food to appear, Toddleator can name things on the mat, count, talk about what she sees. Spills don't show immediately, I recommend post-meal rinses every time. With stuck on food stuffs though, I discovered 'soaking' works better then scrubbing--the paint/ink/print will rub off even with the 'no scratch' sponges I use.Practical and useful."
2,the cutest placemats but the colors scratches off,"These are the cutest placemats that I've seen -- such nice designs and colors. I bought this 123 placement and another ABC one for my two boys. But it is so easily scratched. After a week or two, there were already visible scratches, just from putting utensils on it and normal use. I only washed them using soap and water and a soft washcloth. It is too bad because I haven't seen any designs as adorable as these. Now, months later, the placemats are all scratched up and really need to be replaced. (I worry about whether any of this ink has been consumed with their meals...) I considered buying new ones and having them laminated, but it seems like too much trouble. How hard is it to make a placemat where the color stays on?!?"
5,Hard to find product,I looked everywhere for learning placemats for my grandchildren. Couldn't believe how hard they are to find. This site has lots.
2,Not durable at all,"Our son loved pointing out the animals and eventually the numbers, but the coating wore off so quickly we could barely make out the images. Not worth it."
2,Disappointing,"This video is about 10 minutes of rudimentary and basic techniques, stretched into a seeming eternity of repeats. He shows a stick technique, then replays it from different angles (or even the same angle) a few times, and then shows the same technique with a tonfa...or maybe empty handed...etc. The techniques are okay, but if you practice any style of Filipino martial arts, there's nothing new here.It shows no drills, principles, or concepts behind his style of Kali.I'll give the benefit of the doubt and assume his staccato rhythm was purely for demonstration purposes of the technique, but overall this was very unimpressive, and a huge waste of time and money.I give it two stars, as it MIGHT be interesting to people with no background in Southeast Asian Martial Arts."
4,"Pretty Good - but I ended up liking the ""villain"" the most at the end.","Pretty Good - but I ended up liking the ""villain"" the most at the end. It was pretty enjoyable though - I started to get a little annoyed with the characters at the end though - the hero and heroine were too wishy-washy for me - they were a little pathetic and overly, morosely dramatic. But I loved the ending scene - the bad guy was, too me, in the end the best guy. I love it when a bad guy becomes a good guy - although it's a little bit not so great when he's better and more noble than the hero... I also thought he was better looking, though shorter, than the hero."
4,Good introduction to SpeedEdit,"Was a big help in getting up to speed quickly with the work flow of SpeedEdit. He touches on most everything in the program, But I would have liked a little more on using render or some of the alternatives. Overall I was able to use it and learn quickly how to start using SpeedEdit."
2,"Awesome Blender, NO ONE TO SERVICE IT","I did love my intelliblend. It is the only blender that crushes ice for smoothies or frozen drinks like a bar does. However, I've used it maybe 20 times over the last 2 or 3 years. Just like everyone else, the plastic teeth broke off the bottom. I cannot find the company to replace the part. I'll probably have to get a new blender. Great blender, but don't waste your time. It's not worth all the effort for a 50 cent part!!!"
2,DO NOT buy this blender,After using the blender less than 20 times the blade gears froze and would no longer turn. I contacted Lectrix (this was in 2003) and they sent me a replacement part. Now the retaining ring has cracked and Lectrix has disappeared and I now have to purchase a new blender because I cannot contact the manufacturer to obtain a replacement part that probably costs $2.00! DO NOT BUY THIS BLENDER.
1,rip-off,"Do not purchase this blender. The joint where the pitcher and the base connect is made of plastic and all the plastic teeth broke the second time I used it. The manufacturer cannot be reached for replacement parts. The customer service address they provide does not exist, and after numerous phone calls I have not yet spoken to anyone but an answering machine."
5,Great surprise.,"I was assigned the task of obtaining a blender and a ""smoothie"" recipe book. My wife had a simple Waring in mind, but that model was not in stock. I looked over the features on this one as well as the preceeding reviews and decided to take a chance on the Lectrix and to take a pass on the recipe book. We have not been disappointed. This blender handles mixing chores with ease, and has no problems at all with ice cubes. It's also reasonably quiet. However, the best part is the built-in recipe book. It's simple and intuitive (we did not read the manual) and gives all sorts of great drink recipes, including the smoothie blends that were part of my original assignment. It's not often I go out on a limb like this and come off a domestic hero, but in this case, I've gotten 2 enthusiastic thumbs up from the boss!"
5,The most imaginative game I have ever played,"I loved this game! It was so different from any other I have played. The ""mind"" of the creator of this little gem is something else. There is much to do in this game so it will not be over quickly.So many locations to visit, characters to interact with, and items to find. My very favorite mind and characters are the spies in the milk mans mind-hilarious!!! I love Gargalore too! Do not miss this treasure of a game! All ages will love it. It is worth FAR more than the 9.99 you pay here. Buy it today!"
3,An Okay Adventure Game,"This is the most original game I've ever played!Pros: The best 3D platformer I've ever seen for PC. Graphics were great, The movies were good, and it was always making me laugh. The terrains were fun to explore. Bosses only took a couple tries to beat.Cons: It was really strange. E.g.an evil dentist takes a children's brains out of their heads. I got stuck for a few hours once. I didn't really like the story line. It took over 5 gigs on my hard drive."
1,too twitchy,"I had high hopes given the author of this game. But it is a twitch game. I don't have patience for twitch games. It has a unique look, and if you have great reflexes and patience, you might enjoy it. But if you don't have the reflexes of a 10 year old, you might be frustrated"
4,review,"Product was as advertised. No complaints. It works. I bought this for my son, who had lost his copy of the game. Even though it is an older game, he really enjoyed playing it."
5,Very Good relation of the quest of the Golden Fleece.,"215 pages long. This is the only complete tale of Jason and the Argonauts quest for the Golden Fleece. The story is certainly a classic through curiously not as widely read as Homer. Especially since this work is shorter and easier to read than the Illiad and Odyssey, yet also provides a good prelude to these epics too.My only prior knowledge of the story was the 1963 movie, which has the flavor of a jaunty adventure, compared tothe more dramatic strains of this particular telling. I was most impressed by the map that shows the most likely routegiven the details of the story (although other known versions can differ quite dramatically sometimes). The book alsocontains a Glossary of names that came in useful. This is a very good book that places you in the middle of greekthought and legend."
3,weak story line,"I can not judge this book on its poetic merits, as I am not familiar with ancient Greek. So perhaps in that regard this book truly is a classic. That's for others to say. But what I can say is that I was extremely disappointed in the story line. None of the characters are well fleshed-out or sympathetic, and the motivations for what little action that does take place is extremely weak. Who could really care one way or another about either Jason or Medea, at least as they are presented here? This in no way compares to Homer. Homer's characters are alive and strike a chord with the reader, whereas Appollonius' characters seem to be sleepwalking. I would not recommend reading this unless you were interested in the poetic aspects.(I think I'll have to revisit Euripides. I believe he wrote a play on the subject, and I'm sure that it's a lot better)."
4,Argonautics for the Amateur,"For the amateur who enjoys the wonders, the humanism and the wit of Greek mythology, this is an excellent and very readable account of the great saga of Jason and his associates aboard the mighty Argo. It is not for the scholar. Its principal weakness is that it doesn't capture the poetic sense of the original, but then again, if it's poetry you want, you should probably read the original in Greek."
4,Toto in Paris,"This is a treat for the eyes and the ears. These performances are rich, as is the audio video quality. If you are a TOTO fan, this is a keeper!"
4,Great concert,"Great concert and great filming. The band is better than ever, even though the Autotune on the voices is a bit too much!! Go TOTO!"
4,Like this DVD,A very entertaining DVD. Enjoy this DVD and also bought the CD. Their music spans rock and several other styles.
5,"Wow, just wow!!!!","All the hits are in.Superb audio quality, it rocks!Video quality is not as great a audio, but hey, this is about music, so I still give this a 5 star."
4,Toto - Falling in between (Live DVD),"For those Toto fans you won't be disappointed; all the usual great playing, arrangements and vocals. I did miss Mike Porcaro on bass (he's got such a great feel), but Leland Sklar (Phil Collins/James Taylor etc) does a nice job. Definitely nice to see them playing so many tracks off their new album. Audio and Video quality excellent."
4,They Work - I Didn't Expect Any Less,"I purchased two of these batteries for my Kyocera SL400R digital camera. They work. I am happy.I have learned that leaving this type of battery plugged into a charger is not good for battery life. I ordered two batteries so that I would always have a spare available, but I am also now in the habit of charging the battery until optimum charge is reached and then unplugging the camera from the charger. My hope is that not leaving the camera attached to the charger for days or weeks at a time will increase the lifetime use of the new batteries."
1,Buyer beware of dog!,"This book cannot be trusted. Take a careful look at the title. The original, by Houdini, was called 'The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin."" Unless this book is really about a dog, you better watch out!"
4,This is a great product..............,"I have been getting great results with this product but, when it comes to adjusting the weights like you want to its not as easy to get the weights in porportion to each other but once you to your in great shape!"
4,Awesome product but i could be better,they work really well but uless you have big ankles these will slip other than that they are awesome
3,pretty good but not the best,"The weights were nice and cheap, but the 2 pound bags can break easily. The weight holder wear out fairly fast, but you get your moneys worth."
1,stay away form this item,"it does not fit rightit is hard to adjustable it around your ankle ""even though i have huge legs""it caused me couple injuries with no noticeable benefitsince it does not adjust around your ankle you could tell it is joke to think it will adjust around your wrist.i am not one of those people enjoy writing negative review about the others in fact this is the first negative review i write in AMAZON.for how bad was the product i will stay away from any similar products."
1,Please consider this,"They are large and inconvinient to wear, the sand bags( weights) bulge so much that it's impossible to tighten them on our legs. They will always slip down. Sand bags are hardly adjustable. Worse of all, just after 2 day, small holes appear on each one of the ten sand bags. I would not waste my time typing all these commands if it's not true. I don't know why does it has so many 4-5 stars, but take my advice, DO NOT BUY THEM, the return shipping will cost 20$!!!!"
5,Great Weights,"These are really well made and durable. They adjust to fit easily, and are comfortable to wear. Great for toning the legs, the arms, working sore arthritic knees. I highly recommend these."
4,Bulky but effectice,"The weights divide into 10lbs each, however you can reduce each wrap in 2lb increments (weights are sand packets that are slid into the belt-like system). This allows for building up to the full 10lb capacity. As a beginner, I strongly recommend using only 2 or 4lbs, as other reviews have mentioned, 10lbs is deceptively heavy in an extended period of time. However, slowly increasing the weight allows for continue muscle building and burning more and more calories in the same period of time. At 8-10lbs each, the weights become bulky, so making sure they are secured to your leg or wrist property is helpful or else they ride up and bounce which can throw off your coordination. I also liked how the weights are secured via buckles and two straps allowing for a secure fit that I believe I can trust. Overall, a great way to challenge yourself and expand your workout!"
1,Totally disappointed,"We got these weights for my wife. You can't adjust them tight enough around her ankles, so they slide up and down. There are no instructions at all, on how to use them, or anythingThey're way too big (to wrap around the ankle) for a woman and they're too big even for me.I can't imagine them being used on anyone's wrists"
1,hard to use,"Even with some of the weight packets removed, these are extremely difficult to get secured when using as wrist weights. They slide down and you have to hold them at the edge with your hand to keep them in place. I do not recommend them for use as wrist weights."
3,Disappointed,"I bought these with the idea of doing various exercises I had been doing at physical therapy. The bulkiness of the individual weights was not what I expected. The first time I used the weights, I had a bruise the size of an orange on the back of my leg.I still use them, but wish I had different ones."
3,Great weight but terrible fit,"I have two sets of these weights for leg workouts a ten lb. set and this 20 lb. set. This set is 10lb. each thus 20lb. They are bulky and very hard to strap on, they slip around a lot and are not comfortable. I need more then the 5 lb. ankle weights so I put up with these because I really do notice a difference in the workout using these, I just wish they were easier to get on and not so clumsy. The 5lb. each set is far more comfortable on the ankle and easier to put on, maybe I should have gotten to pairs of those and used two on each leg, hmmm."
3,Too bulky!,"Yes... they are weights and serve the purpose of exercising. However, these weights are HUGE!!! Really bulky and hard to keep around any appendage. If you try to take the individual weight packs out... good luck getting them back in."
2,ok,"Will wear through quickly, but at least as good a deal as solid bar weights from Everlast at half the cost"
3,decent for the money,"ok product for he money. complaints. Even with just a couple weights they sit atop the ankles and are uncomfortable- even hurt. maybe a pad liner on the inside would improve this product. 2nd the weight packs are a bit difficult to insert. be carefull and patient, the material is thin and won't take alot of force. My trick ; put them in part way and then lightly shake the belt up and down. strange but it works.all around a good product for the money."
5,"Weight-adjustable, Size-adjustable ankle-weights",The weights are well-made and sturdy and adjust to the size of my ankle. Weight-packets are removable to adjust the amount of weight in use.A good value.
4,Great weights,I haved these for about 3 weeks. They are pretty good but when you are walking they move up and down but they still are fun to use. I like to walk around in because when you take them off it feels like your legs are really light. It is hard to run but really worth it.
1,Unusable,"What a shame. The ankle weights are smooth against the skin and look like they are made to be comfortable. The problem however is that these are HUGE! They are not made for average sized people let alone smaller people like myself. I can guess that these wouldn't even fit a man. You'd have to be buff to wear these and your calves have to be huge. They're totally falling off. Also, the weight is distributed into too small parts and doesn't feel like ten pounds but more like 'five. If you have fitness goals, these won't help you reach them."
3,Could be more comfortable.,"I wear these to walk to work every day. I like them overall, but I have to stop every once and a while to readjust how they sit on my legs because they often slip and hit my ankle bones. I can fix the problem by slipping them around to a more comfortable spot, but they could be more comfortable to begin with."
3,Bulky but works,"This product would be better for guys, but for small girls like me the straps don't really tighten enough, so they are really loose and bulky... but they are weight and its good to help out with my bad knee."
2,Bulky and cumbersome,"I've been weight training for years and even do competitive stairclimbing. I bought these with the idea that I would use them to train for stairclimbing.I'm not a small woman...5 feet 8 inches, 135 lbs, but these weights were almost impossible to keep on my ankles...they just don't seem to be made for an average woman's ankles.I may pass these onto my husband who is 6 feet 2 and 220 lbs. I would not recommend these for an average sized woman."
4,Nice Weights,"I use these as wrist weights while using a Nordic Track Ski Machine. For this purpose they are great. I took four neoprene soda can coolers and slit them down the side to use as inner padding, two on each wrist. Stacking a cotton wrist band for sweat absorption, can cooler, can cooler, then pull the wrist weight tight on each wrist and they fit nice and snug and don't move around at all. Took a few times to get the sequence right but now it's a snap. Not sure the material the product is made of will last a real long time but I'm happy with the product and the price is right, plus ten pounds on each arm for an hour will give you an awesome workout.edit 3-15-09After using these great weights for a time I can offer some advice on handling. Be gentle with these. If you toss/drop them on the floor after you take them off you'll eventually rupture the plastic sand bags inside and leak sand out a little at a time. Still-- a very nice product."
4,Adjustable weights is great feature but hurts if worn snugly,"The ankle weights were a Christmas present for my daughter. She likes being able to adjust the amount of weight. The one con is that she has to wear them loose because the sandbags are firm and hurt her ankle bone if she tightens the straps. The price was great, and Amazon's free shipping for Christmas delivery was the best!!!"
3,Valleo 20# ankle weights,"I'm 5'4"" tall and weigh 135#. The weights were way too big for me & slipped off the lower legs & on to the heels. Couldn't make them any tighter. The outside construction is good. However the weight inserts are verly flimsily covered & poorly sewn & very difficult to re insert. I would be afraid that they would split open after a few handlings. If you larger than I & wouldn't want to remove the weights then it's fine. For me it wouldn't work. I have seen other products with insert bags that are sewn much better & out of stronger material. Unfortunately it's not that easy finding 20# ankle weights."
2,Good for larger ankles,"These weights are heavy. However, if you are a female with small ankles, these weights will be to large. Would not recommend for small ankles. I can not even wrap them around my wrist because they would fall off from not getting tight enough."
1,They ripped :(,"i liked them although they were very bulky, but somehow it ripped and now one of the bags always falls out :("
2,THESE ARE NOT 20 POUND WEIGHTS!!!,"The box is labeled ""20 lb Adjustable Ankle/Wrist Weights"". But you'll get a pair of 10 lb adjustable weights if you order this product. Otherwise they are as advertised."
4,Fantastic Throatsinging,I bought this CD for the throatsinging--which was great! Not a big fan of the other stuff--but I got what I wanted!
3,Between 3 and 4 stars really,"It's not bad...but you have to be prepared for some traditional, bare, stark stuff there, too - like some throat singing, which I'm not that very fond of.However, not all is traditional, there is also some contemporary folk, such as Charlie Ningiuk, André Brassard, ...I like this part best, and this CD would be a good general introduction if there was more of the modern stuff, in which the Inuit usually excel.Note that just like the other CDs of this series (enter ""Eskimo, inuit"" into the search box), this very rare CD is now also listed in European branches of Amazon Amazon-uk (England), -de, -fr)."
2,dissappointed,"I loved the movie, but was quite dissappointed in the CD. The music was not like I remembered from the movie."
1,Garth doesnt float,I bought this soundtrack because I wanted the song To make you feel me love by Garth brooks. It is advertised as being on this cd. The song was not sung by garth Brooks instead sung by Trisha Yearwood..This is false advertising and just a flat out lie..Do not buy this it is just a big lie......
4,Hope stays afloat,"'Hope Floats' was lifted from being an OK movie to something more memorable by the soundtrack, which includes at least half a dozen great songs. My favourite - 'To make you feel my love' - features Garth Brooks but, on the CD is sung instead by Trisha Yearwood: and her version is simply wonderful. It's a CD worth listening to"
3,Not the original soundtrack,"I had lost this CD some time ago so I decided to purchase it again and I did not realize it wasn't the same exact one. It did not have the Garth Brooks version of ""To make you feel my love"" that I prefer. Also it had about 4 different songs at the end that were new that I didn't really care for."
3,There are two Hope Float CD's,"There are actually two different Hope Floats Soundtracks. The first one that came out in 97 has Garth Brooks track of ""To Make You Feel My Love."" This one doesnt have it. So make sure you look at the year the cd was released. I love the original that came out a whole lot better. I do need the extra tracks."
1,misleading description,"I am thoroughly dissappointed in this cd. I understood this was a ""soundtrack"" of the songs in the movie. Well, all it is is the instumental background music, not not the songs actually sung in the movie. I DO NOT recommend this cd. It is a rip. Every other soundtrack I have ever bought had ALL the songs in the movie. That's why it's called a SOUNDTRACK! Pitiful!"
1,It would be nice to get what I order...,"Well, I ordered this cd about a month ago, was supposed to get it october 15th, still no cd. Do you really want my review? because If I had any idea it would take this long, I would have ordered it from somebody else first.Like I said, I still haven't received my cd?Any suggestions?Thanks for nothing I guess...."
3,Waiting for Hope Floats non origonal version.,I lost mine from sharing it a long time ago. It was one of the best cd's I've ever listened to. I loved most every song. I did not realize this one didn't have the Garth Version. I am disappointed and I haven't even received this one yet. I hope it's not the instrumentals only because I will be even more disappointed. I can not find the origonal version anywhere. Does anyone know where to order the origonal version. I have looked in so many stores and on line. Thank you very much..
5,Hope Floats,This is an awesome soundtrack. It is fun and enjoyable to listen to. The best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
3,disappointed,"I was disappointed when I received this cd. I had once had this cd several years ago and it was stolen. I decided to replace it recently after I had watched the movie. However, the song that I had really wanted that used to be on it (Garth Brooks), was no longer a part of the cd. I'm still listening to the other songs but had mainly bought it for that one. Will have to buy an separate cd for the Garth Brooks song"
4,Beware the New Age,"This is a very good book written by Sharon Beekman that trusted the ""spirit guides"" that promised her fulfillment. By the time she discovered their frightening, true identity, it was too late-they had taken control of her mind...tormenting her, attacking her sanity, pushing her to the brink of suicide. But in her darkest hour, Sharon discovered a Savior, Jesus Christ, who is powerful enough to free her from the evil that threatened to destroy her. This book is a revealing look at New Age practices and the dangers involved. I really enjoyed this book and I could relate to some of the things in it, as I also had tried some of the New Age teachings, with their empty promises. This is a remarkable testimony to the liberating power of Jesus."
2,A problem with trust,"Anyone who has read an authorative work on possession like Hostage to the Devil back to back with this book can't help but wonder a bit about the sincerity of the author. The jacket claims she is on faculty at Denver Seminary and she is certainly deeply invested in her faith but an element in all possession includes the invitation of the phenomenon by the possessed. To try to blame it on someone else who happens to be at odds with her faith is a bit much. Anyone with a scanty knowlege of New Age teachings can't help wonder whether this is just a piece of devotional literature cooked up by a fantasy prone individual. If she really did live through this horror, a catholic priest with special training could have saved here a LOT of grief. Taking some personal responsibility comes to mind as well."
1,Needs more love from the light,"Boy, is this one hard to swallow or what. If you are a fundementalist looking for someone to agree with you, this is it. If you are looking for a display of tolerance and unconditional Christian love, go somewhere else. Extremist hate speech."
2,"High expectations, bitter disappointment","As a prospective Brittany owner I have been researching the breed for about 6 months and from the outside, ""Living with Brittanys:A Survival Guide"" seemed like it would provide me with the essential information I needed to decide whether the breed was right for me. Sadly, I was bitterly disappointed. ""Living with Brittanys"" is a frustratingly OVER-descriptive, self indulgent short story that actually made me angry in parts because of it's non-relevance to the subject matter. The story itself could have been about ANY dog and I learned all I needed to know in the last two pages through a bullet pointed list of common brittany traits. I wish I had saved both my money and time."
5,Hablemos frances como franceses!,"Para aprender un idioma, recomiendo elanguage. Es facil de entender, hay muchos ejercicios de conversacion y principalmente se puede comprobar si se habla como ""extranjero"" o ""nativo"". La entrega fue rapida y en excelentes condiciones."
2,too small,"This is a very compact bag for carrying a SLR and 5 lenses. If you have a small entry-level SLR and 5 skinny (no more than 58mm) lenses, then you can probably squeeze them all in this bag, but without the hoods. If the lens pockets were half an inch wider, this bag would be much more usable. Unlike camera bags from more popular brands like LowePro, the compartments cannot be configured to be significantly bigger.If your gear does fit and you don't like hoods, then this bag does appear to be well made. There are several pockets around the sides for carrying little things like batteries and memory cards. The pockets are all kind of skinny, though, so bulky items like your filter case won't fit."
3,Case Logic Camera bag,"The bag is nice and light weight while being sturdy enough to hold a D200. Forget about putting my D3 in it though. While it says it will hold 5 lenses, don't count on it. The sides aren't large enough to put a long telephoto lens in safely. Try more like 3 lenses."
3,Decent bag for the price,"This bag holds my camera body (D90) just barely with the 18-135 lense or the 70-300 on the body. The problem is you can not put your lens hood on and put it in the bag either as being used or turned to where its just on the lense. The side pockets will hold a charger and necesseties as well as one lense. I was able to put my 70-300 in the side with very little room to spare.Overall good product, no failures yet and still using it."
4,nice bag; little tight,"i like the bag, although it feels a little tight to hold the number of lenses it's spec'd for. however, i haven't packed it out with lenses to test it. i use it to carry my d40, canon hf100 vid camera (in a lens slot) and the associated wires, chargers and connectors. for that purpose, it works extremely well. i'm happy with my purchase."
4,One of the best camera bags,My wife and I really like the sling that supports the camera and one installed lens. The camera has a few waterproof zippers and pockets. Very easy to use and versatile.
4,recurve bow,"The bow is what my son wanted. He really likes it. A little black rubber end came off the end where you string it, but it was no big deal. We took it to Bass Pro and the guy just glued it back on and said it wasn't any big deal and should be fine. He has been using it off and on and hasn't had any other trouble. I am happy with it.Thanks"
2,MARRIAGE VS. FREEDOM,"Cynthia S. SmithWhy Women Shouldn't Marry(Secaucus, NJ: Lyle Stuart, 1988) 223 pagesA breezy, entertaining, outspoken bookencouraging women to keep their freedominstead of succumbing to the traditional pattern of wedlock.Discourages both first and second marriages.Lots of examples of people in bad marriagesand women loving their freedom and independence.Looking for more such books? Search the Internet for:""The Best Books Critical of Traditional Marriage""."
2,a review of the reviews,"All I want to know is if the book in questiob is an accurate translation of the Koran (Quran, whatever). There is way too much arguing and posturing in these reviews about the Koran in general and not enough discussion about the individual translation itself."
2,Review - or diatribe?,"People - you are both wrong in what you are doing. Pro and Anti-muslim arguments really don't belong here. Information regarding the translation and accuracy maybe, but the Quran is not on trial here. Focus on the product - not it's teaching.Frankly, it would be nice for people to know that there are no ""original manuscripts"" for translation and that the Quran is thousands of years newer than the Bible. I think it is interesting that there are contradicting passages that are not a contradiction because Allah can change his mind - but that isn't really a review of this particular book."
2,Good Resource,This translation is a good resource for anyone wanting a greater understanding of the Muslim community. Our current times are such that mutual understanding between religous communities is important. This book is easy to read.
3,QUR'AN (Koran),"I was amazed at this internationally acclaimed tome. I have read only a small portion so far, and find it poorly written with many ill-defined references and many internal conflicts. I was also surprised at how much of it deals with punishment for disbelieving in its tenets, but the tenets were not very clearly defined.Perhaps it gets better later, so I will not pass judgement on the book as a whole."
3,a frightening collection of thoughts,The minds involved in creating the basics that this book portrays are warped and poisoned with the precepts it embodies.
5,Perhaps the very best English translation available.,"This is an excellent translation, as it keeps intact the main critical wording, as like it says ""Allah"" instead of the English ""God"" and it tells us that ""Isa"" is Aramaic for Jesus, and Qur'an instead of Koran, so I like it giving info like that.The translator was from Pakistan then later published this through New York.I highly recommend it for anyone serious about reading the Qur'an."
3,GENERAL COMMENT,"This book arrived in great shape and is as I expected, many pages and small print much like the Bible. Definetly worth the money for interesting browsing considering the current Islamic world situation."
3,What do they really believe?,"I purchased this book because I wanted to know what Muslims really live their lives by. It was suppose to be a ""used"" book. However, It was obviously never used before I received it. Not a bad bargain for eleven cents. As I began reading it I found it to be very accepting of other people's beliefs and a book of love and peace. I was surprised that as I continued to read it became less peaceful and more violent toward anyone who disagreed with the ""Prophet's teachings. I have only read the first 50 pages, so will probably gain more insight into what is taught on the whole. I know that many would say that I shouldn't ""muddy"" my mind by reading the Qur'an. I don't agree. Though I read the Bible daily and believe in it's teachings for my own life I do believe that I should personally find out about what others believe so I can have a better understanding of them."
5,A definite must read,"Great Book, Will help put life in perspective. Great resource for a better understanding of God's will."
4,Useful Book,"Not perfect But If you want to know about Islam or for that matter Convert to it, this would be a Prefect Book, In aLanguage you can understand and a Belief you can See that Prophet Muhammad is real and Truthful, I recommed it for anyone that has an Intrest in Islam."
1,Really,"Come on... 8:12 ""Remember your lord inspired the angels(with the message): ""I am with you: give firmness to the believer: I will instill terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers: you smite above their necks and smite all their finger tips off them.""""There are your morals for you, the Koran is no different from the western bible. People have to start accepting this as the work of pure fiction."
1,For the love of Ala,"These are nice stories but when taken literally puts people back in the stone age like fighting, dumb, primitive apes. Religion is BS folks."
3,Not something I'm into but it helps to understand,"I ordered this book to learn about their religion so I could better understand their point of view. So I could see both sides of the situation. This book translates their language in to English terms and makes the reader understand things in the proper manner.All in all, I did not end up finishing the book as I lost interest. However it did give me a different outlook on their religion and the difference between Islam the religion and the extremists. Thats all I needed to know.I recommend this book to anyone who is wondering about the Islam Religion."
2,Frightening,"This is a struggle to read. There is much that the author says cannot be properly understood unless read in the original language. I believe that statement is self serving from Muslim who dosn't want to admit that his religion is one of hate for non-believers. The message enclosed in this book is a wakeup call from someone who, centuries ago, changed his writings based on his perception of how the world should be, not how people can be."
5,Agree with Muslims,Was looking for books on islam when I came upon these reviews below. I agree that you should not put religious figures like mohommed on film or pictures. If the Christians in this country were not so lukewarm and weak...then they would feel the same way about Jesus. Why do you all allow Christ to be portrayed on film by a sinful human actor? If Jesus was Son of God then why allow Mel Gibson to mock Christ? As least Muslims have engough respect for faith not to defile religion by making cheesy movies. Maybe Christians need to be as devout as muslims are and stop being so weak and lazy.
1,Harsh,"Don't let the pretty cover design fool you, this book is violent, terrifying, and teaches hate and bigotry. Good thing none of it is true, or I would have nightmares. If someone or some country were to take this book seriously, man oh man there would be trouble a brewin!!"
5,Cant Miss,I love this watch. It is a great watch for a man. It is pretty large and you can't miss it. I have been complimented on it. Looks like a million $$. Solid as a rock. I plan to buy another to put away so if they stop making it I will have a spare.
1,not so great,"Doesn't work nearly as well as the older blue sticky tack made by a different company. This yellow handitak doesn't have much sticking power.....won't hold a picture frame straight on the wall for longer than a day, something the old blue type used to do easily. Also, this yellow type has left yellow smeary marks on my painted walls (Benjamin Moore flat paint), something the old blue tack never did. It's impossible to remove the yellow residue stain without removing your wall paint. I'll have to repaint those small areas of my wall. Can't recommend this product--there are better alternatives."
1,For kids only,"This stuff is weak. May hold paper together, but little else.I wanted something to fix some of the moldings in my car...you know fix some drooping trim work. Well this hardly did the job."
3,Mainstream moment?,"The editorial review says Miami 2005 has got its mainstream moments.I would rather say the whole darn CD is one stretched mainstream moment.Once so great and cool Azuli Records seems to be leaning back, selfsatisfied with its image of being on top of the throbbing waves of underground dance music.But every marketeeer can tell you that to keep your image you've got to keep working on it. If an image is a promise, the stuff you do and the products you offer is keeping the promise.The Greeks had a nice term for extreme arrogance and thinking you're the greatest: hubris. In all Greek stories, everybody who was so selfintoxicated they thought they could battle the Gods died horribly. I hope Azuli's fate is different. Work on it guys.Nonetheless I give this CD three stars because it's problem is also its strength: you can't go wrong with it. But its too bland for greatness.DJK"
5,A Star Is Born,"Chiara Civello is a new musical force to be reckoned with and her debut CD is a must have for those who want to get on this bandwagon early. Though some reviewers want to compare her to others, the wondrous thing about Chiara is that her voice and her talents are unique. Her songs, most of which she's written herself, are a beautiful mix of jazz and pop with an international flavor that demands serious attention. Her voice is strong, beautiful and her styling lyrical and unpretentious. I have been lucky enough to see her perform in small clubs a couple of times and she is dynamite in person! The best part is that she is only just getting started and you sense that the best is yet to come. Don't miss this CD!"
4,A minor flaw,"A very attractive pen, writes smoothly, it is light in weight and light in price.I found only one flaw: the cap is made of very thin plastic, and after a few weeks, it developed a hairline crack about 3/16"" long, which means the cap does not close as securely as before? As a make shift repair, I just attached some clear tape to the crack, in order not to have the crack get larger and/or lose the cap."
2,Veterans Way,"They first kissed at age nine, to celebrate VJ Day. A few short years later, they fell in love in earnest, but he went off to another war and both moved on to other loves. Now, 60 years after that first kiss, Stephanie Watson and James Scott meet again, ready for each other now. Love long delayed is not denied, and it seems that God has given them a new chance for the promise they once made to come true. Not everyone is as happy about this reunion as they are. Will their second chance have to fall to the wayside?** If you ever lost a love, the message is do not give up hope, you may find it again. Faith infuses the story from first to last. Take a leisurely walk to hope, with faith and love as your guides. **"
1,Timmerman probably has an agenda,"In this book, Kenneth Timmerman appears to be a biased writer. The fact that he has written for some of the most right-wing media should give the reader a clue where he is coming from. I would suggest you do your own very careful homework while reading SHAKEDOWN."
5,Excellent Expose - Can we get rid of this guy?,I think this is one of the best reads I have ever had regarding a public figure. I wonder why we allow people like this to still run around our country and actually have an effect.Shakedown is the right title as well. He has perfected the shakedown of corporations. I liked where some stood up to his shakedown approach and his attempt to control companies and engratiate his corporations and friends with the loot that comes from shaking down corporate America.We need to wake up and take notice as a nation and individually. Jackson is portrayed at making a mockery of justice for the underpriveledged. He disenfranchises his own for his own gain and the gain of those who have kept him in the spotlight.Read this book and tell everyone else about it.
5,It's about time!,(...)This book is ablueprint for a successful prosecution. The disclosure of Jesse's gangties is precious. The red carpet treatment from Democratic presidentsand Democratic presidential candidates is typical racialpolitics. Think about Jesse's history and influence with past andfuture Democratic presidents when you vote in 2004.(...)Why did it take so long for someone to exposethis man?
1,Tastless,"If anyone should have been locked up and the keys thrown away, its JJ. Never have I seen someone so shameless that he still goes around thinking he's so important. Thanks to the author for exposing this man....for what he is."
3,"Interesting facts, lousy writing","The information in the book is interesting and brings light to the background workings of the civil rights industry. But the book is poorly written, skipping forward and backward through timelines, mentioning the same connection information over and over. The writer, in my opinion wanted to hammer Jesse so badly that the book went schizophrenic in its presentation. Worth reading, but you will have to force yourself to finish it."
5,White or Black: Wrong is Wrong,"Jessie Jackson has strived to be accepted as an opinion leader in our contemporary society. Should he not expect that his actions will have been chronicled and historical observations made? While the author does interject commentary, the root of the book is a compilation of public data. Jessie proves himself to be the same man, who, in the time of the African slavery trade to America, stood on the African shore and sold his black brothers to the white man. Jessie's mantra must be: ""It's all about ME!"" Read the book. It shows you the man."
4,How to fly 1st class with no job?,"I've lived in Jesse's declared hometown, Chicago, for 10 years now. Even with local news coverage ad nauseum about this ""pastor"" I've learned much more about the man-inside-the-man called Jesse. I've given the book 4 out of 5 stars only because Timmerman was at times overly protective of facts that it sometimes became overdone. It is unfortunate that the facts are needed to offset the usual cry of ""Racism"" surely to be assigned this book. I can assure you it is not racists in its more fundamental definition. What I cannot assure you is the racist motives behind EVERYTHING this man does."
5,Jesse Jackson: An American Disgrace,"This book is amazing! Any intelligent American knows by now that ""Reverend"" Jesse Jackson is nothing more than a scam artist and common racketeer. What is amazing is not his dull witted extortion, nor his nonsense racist rhetoric. What is truly incredible is that productive members of our society, CEOs and presidents of huge corporations, actually give this imbecile, his family, and cronies thousands of dollars to keep him quiet! After reading it, you won't know whether to laugh or cry at his incredible greed or corporate America's gullibility. Timmerman is certainly not going to get invited to any Hillary Clinton fundraisers after this one!"
3,THANK YOU JESSE JACKSON....NO MATTER HOW YOU DID IT...YOU GOT THE JOB DONE!!,"I am Aware of all this written in the book about Jackson.... All Black People have known of his Endeavors & Ambition. IT IS NOTHING NEW.... HOWEVER JESSE HAS TREADED, HE GOT THE JOB WELL DONE!! By Any Means Necessary..........GO JESSE!!!"
4,Best Pete Walker I've Seen,"I have to disagree with the other reviewers here and praise this film. Maybe part of the reason I got so much out of it was that I wasn't expecting much and got pleasantly suprised. I wasn't expecting much because I'd recently seen a couple other of Walker's films (House of Whipcord and another) and thought they were completely without artistic merit. But this one is really quite a good film. Much like an Italian Giallo, there is a nice combination of spine-tingling suspense, cool outfits and set pieces, and softcore sexuality. The story is quite compelling, Susan George is great as the sexy and troubled go-go dancer on the run, Judy Huxtable and the guy who plays the evil father are palpably hateable . . . This is a Pete Walker film that actually has a story worth paying attention to, and a mood that takes you in from the first scene and doesn't let you go until the final credits."
4,I Passed- Need I say more?,"Using this book (I also purchased another different math study book [general, not CLEP specific] from a brick and mortar store, but it was so lousy, I did a few problems and then recycled it), I was able to study and pass my CLEP test.One LARGE thing of note, however, is that the tests change often, and the books often do not. So the book I studied (the one here) had useful information on things on my test. BUT, it also covered topics seen nowhere on my test. Additionally, there were entire topics on the test, that were nowhere to be found with the book.This problem is more with the CLEP test as opposed to the book. The book was clear, consise and DEFINITELY assisted me with my math studies and passing the CLEP examination.Despite the nuances of the book and test not covering the same thing, I still got a 73 (50 is passing).Thanks"
2,Dark prints,"In a work disappointing, I love this alpha set and own 2 origional prints so I ordered a copy of the whole set. The prints in the book are unclear and printed in color on colored paper making them much too dark and the details almost illegible. I have made block prints and LOVE them I have several reprints of other sets which are fantastic- these are just bad...."
5,my childhood favourite!,"Wow, I cannot believe I found this book in an English translation. It sure deserves one. Of course I read the Dutch version (being Dutch myself), and I occasionally re-read it even though I'm well past the YA age by now. The whole concept of the author telling us this is a real story based on a real journal that she was sent in the mail (written by the main character, the boy who travels between worlds) is truly captivating and original (well, at least it was when this book first came out). Buy this book, you won't be disappointed!"
4,a beautiful journey of intimacy and spiritual revelation,This is a well-written and courageous semi-autobiographical account of one woman's journey towards self-discovery through intimate relationship. The sensitive and insightful reader will identify with many of the beautifully expressed emotions and experiences here. I found it hard to put down until the end.
3,Nice but I would have liked to have seen more labeling,The prefrontal cortex is totally ignored in this chart. That is a shame. It is good for what it is but it is missing a lot of critical information in my opinion. It does look good and is good quality. It is nicely done but where is the front part of the brain... the part we think with????
1,Poor packaging,I will not order from this company again. A beautiful extra-large laminated anatomy poster with brilliant graphics was FOLDED twice to fit in a box that had ample space for it to ship rolled in a cylinder. It's just a shame that they didn't take better care in preserving the integrity of their product!
2,Interesting - then boring!,"The case-studies were interesting! The rest was B O R I N G!You want info on UFO's? Rent seasons 1-9 of ""The X-Files"" on DVD or the X-Files movie, ""Fight The Future"". At least you'll be able to stay awake, and it won't cost you nearly as much money."
1,$$ down the drain,"Sure enough, I forgot to pack my foamy ear plugs. I the past I've experienced unbelievable ear pain with the pressure changes--fortunately, it seems, that is no longer the case. However, I like the plugs for engine noise blocking. Scoured the airport in Anchorage for the foamy ones--NONEXISTENT. The only ones available were EarPlanes--1 pair/$10.99!!! There was no amount of ear pulling and contorcioning that enabled my getting these things situated. I left them in as best I could and finally had to pull them out because they actually made my outer ear canal hurt. The money would definitely have been better spent elsewhere! And if for some reason you do like these, definitely do not buy them at the Anchorage airport."
2,Not for me,"I also bought a pair of these and used them on my last trip. While they worked for the most part, they were not as good as the foam ones like the flight attendants give you. Additionally, they are so rigid they don't shape to your ear the way the foam ones do. Thus, they fall out more easily and I don't like putting something in my ear that's been on the floor. Just not a good value for the price, in my opinion."
4,worth a try but not amazon,"If you like to try this out, order it online from Walmart. It is $3.97 plus your state tax and free delivery to your home. I just ordered a pair and could not believe the price difference. $4.28 vs $10.98.[...]"
4,An original take on the story,"This is the actual story ""Gigi"" not the film version and it is charming. It is a novella (a short story/book) and takes about 2 - 3 hours to read. Just about everyone knows the story so I won't go there. Collette's characters are sympathetic, especially Gigi, and well written and her imagery is really in top form. This was her only ""comedy"". It's a small book that literally fits in your pants pocket so you can read it on the train going to work. It's a good investment at a good price."
2,Subtle Messianism,"The music is quite good...BUT...potential buyers should be aware that there is a distinct evangelical bent to the music. Adam Lee Rosenfeld, the band's leader and Israeli convert to Christianity, admitted in an interview that he uses his music to subtly target Israeli youth with his messianic message. So, as long as ones feathers aren't ruffled by the band's evangelical Christian agenda, fans of Indie rock will enjoy this CD."
3,disappointing,"I picked up this book, expecting to read a courageous struggle of someone who was diagnosed with ALS, like the mother of my best friend from grade school. Instead, it was a sugary story with quite a bit of famous name dropping and speaking badly of doctors/researchers who are too ""stupid"" to get together and figure out a cure. Most people aren't able to spend their entire summer at the Hamptons, or shmoozing with people like Ben Stiller, Katie Couric, or Jackie O. I would much rather read about a working mother who has to find the words to tell her children she won't be with them much longer. I think THAT is much more courageous than pulling strings with big celebrities to raise money."
4,A very moving memoir,"This was another memoir I wasn't sure I would keep reading. I am glad that I gave this book a chance. It is a very moving, sad book. I think about it fairly often."
3,lifetime movie,"I actually bought the book after seeing the lifetime movie. I have to say I would recommend the movie over the book. Maybe its because I saw the movie first, usually its the other way around. The book is kind of boring compared to the movie, I guess I just expected more from the book."
3,"Meh. Very sad and somewhat moving, but not entirely memorable.","First off, I have to admire how Jenifer used her illness and influence to educate others and raise awareness and money for ALS.That said, I have to agree with the others who said that this book seemed to be heavy on the early-childhood memories and name-dropping than it was about Jenifer's self-awareness and feelings throughout her illness. I would have liked to know how more about how she created and structured Project ALS--it seemed like she just picked up the phone and called a few of her celebrity friends to organize a fundraiser. It might have been more powerful and meaningful if she had gone into more detail about her feelings and thoughts as the disease progressed.I'm glad I read this book. I certainly do appreciate the courage that Jenifer and her sisters had around ALS, but I agree with the other reviewers who could have done without the list of her many celebrity friends and childhood stories."
4,Very informative and interesting.,"After reading the whole series of Sharpe books I felt left wanting to learn more about the wars in which the books talk about. This book explains each book in detail. Ranging from the equipment the troops used to the tactics under which they fought.Alot of research went into this book and it's highly informative. It takes the book past Sharpe to the actual event's he was written into. The British success in defeating Napoleon in the pennisular wars was a major turning point in world history, this book helps us better understand the struggle it was to defeat Napoleon.Cornwell does a wonderful job at describing the events that took place to each relevant Sharpe book but this book takes it one step further.It's a truly educating book, a must for anyone wanting to take their interest in history a step further then the Sharpe series.4 Stars."
5,The Sharpe Companion: The Early Years,This book was as advertised. That's all I ask from a vendor on Amazon.
4,"I just started reading this book, but it jumped to the top of my reading list","The book was delivered quickly and I previewed the first few pages. Before I knew it, this book had jumped to the top of my-time reading list. I look foward to enjoying this book when my course reading is done for the day. Anyone who is a fan of the Sharpe movies will like this book, because it gives a more detail into Sharpe's mindset and the campaigns he participated in."
5,Very Cool,"This disc is just full of great music played by Les Paul and his various groups from the '40's. It is highly enjoyable with lots of sophisticated guitar playing. Les was young and vibrant. Kick out the jams! There is noticeable ""hiss"" throughout the entire disc due to the recording technologies of the time period but the playing is so hot you can just tune it out. This one is definitely a keeper!"
2,HOme Free,"Not the sellers fault, and certainly not the musicians fault, but the cd doesn't play so I can't give a review on the music. Generally really enjoy these guys."
3,good read - interesting technique - sometimes dense,"The opening chapter pulled me right in with its immediacy and intrigue. Nothing is sure. Every description adds to the shadows and vagueness. In the end, though, the book didn't quite live up to my hopes as a novel. But the book is still a great read. The characters are expertly painted and the narrative that examines events from the eyes of different people through different times is interesting. The questions posed are important and sometimes get in the way of the story. The author's skill is apparent but I stumbled from time to time over the narrative. Read in light of and author like Sarte whose novels are a thin veil for his philosophical studies the work makes more sense."
5,You couldn't ask for anything more.,"What could be more fun to a proofreader and freelance editor than reading an engaging, enjoyable, enlightening, entertaining, n-th degree perfect book on the proper use of our English language. It's a delightful education with many smiles."
5,Word Court is great!,"I bought Word Court several months ago, and now I'm not sure how I got along before I had it. It's true that this book doesn't give you radically different advice from other usage guides, but as Barbara Wallraff explains, it can be hard to know whether the usage notes in a decade-old dictionary or manual still apply or whether standards have changed. The real point of a book like this is, what kind of use of words seems contemporary, intelligent, and tasteful -- neither too stuffy and old-fashioned or too trendy and self-consciously cool. If you care about that, you'll probably end up feeling the way I do: Word Court is great!"
2,"Entertaning, but not terribly helpful","I bought this book with high expectations after having hearing the author on National Public Radio. I thought that it would highlight the degredation of the English language; I hoped that it would help me hone my use of English.However, the book did not do this for me. Perhaps I was wrong in expecting it to. In fact, however, it didn't do ANYthing for me but raise new hackles. Instead of providing any kind of guidance as to ""more accepted"" and ""less accepted"" uses of English words and phrases, it left me hanging. The book has an annoying tendency to present letters from people who make various observations, only to couple with the author's brilliant commentary which, distilled to its core point, tends to be ""Hmmm. Interesting point.""I guess I'm just the kind of person who prefers not just to raise questions, but to have some attempt at answering them. This book doesn't make those attempts to answer."
5,Authoritative and amusing - a great combination,"Grammar can be deadly. This is not grammar but usage, the way we write, what it says about us, how to say it better. The author is authoritative, but the approach is very approachable - and often very funny. You can read it as a reference or for fun."
3,Book Review,This book is good for an overview of the course or the program. Don't expect to learn a lot from it. It is good for a one day workshop. It is very simple and basic but for a beginner. As a teacher I am using this book to introduce my students to FrontPage 2000 (course lenght is 27 hrs of instructions).
4,Great game. nice book,For those of you who played Legend of Legaia you should know that the arts lists alone are worth the price of this book. There are quite a few mazes in this one too to which the book helps infantly.
2,Strategy Guide vs On-Line Walkthroughs,"For the money that is being charged for this item, it is better to just go on-line to any of the game stores and get a text walkthrough that is more accurate and easier to follow than this strategy guide."
4,nicee....from a real female gamer,Doesn't surpass the original but nicce can't say much i just started it but not bad.
5,Works perfectly,"I own a software company and we use this device in front of our web servers. In the 15 months this has been in production, we haven't had a single problem. It's rock solid.But, unless you're smart and willing to learn a lot, be ready to pay a consultant 90-150 / hour to set this up for you. A pro should be able to do most set ups in less than an hour.We have several site to site VPN's that connect to this, and I also dial in to create VPN connections from my laptop. I've been real happy with this purchase."
3,evilspeak....wow,I saw this movie opening day long long ago...lol..im glad to have it on DVD for my collection..its worth 9.95 with shipping..!!
4,"Sarge says..""Watch this film you little Co*#suckers""","My God....if you call yourself a horror genre afficiado then you MUST own this.Keep it in it's proper place....early 80's with corresponding special effects and WOW.....you must be impressed.And if all else fails...""I'll show you a trick....how I change a little boy into a little girl""...."
1,Unhappy with product,"The glue dries up too quickly. I purchased them for my mother who makes jewelry and I purchased about 5 of them and by the time she got to the second one (about 4 months later, the other tubes were dried out, We have found another product that does not dry out and works very well."
5,Future Glue is super.,This is the best super glue on the market in my opinion. It has worked on everything I've used it on. The fact that it brushes on only adds to its usefulness. I would highly recommend this super glue!
5,An excellent and recommended guide for trip planning,"Papa Mike's Cook Islands Handbook is a fun and informative resource for vacationers and business travelers seeking to take advantage of all thirteen occupied islands in pursuit of what the Cook Islands chain has to offer. From complete trip planning (whether luxury to budget style), to a complete inter-island flight schedule, 40 maps and pictures, coverage on popular activities on each island including diving, fishing, snorkeling, horseback riding, surfing, tours, cultural events and more, Papa Mike's Cook Islands Handbook excellent and recommended guide for trip planning."
5,Impossible to resist!,"Keith Thomas's Religion and the Decline of Magic was the first of my books for summer reading, and I doubt that any novel that I choose will be half as entertaining or any text as informative. By the conclusion I felt that I was completing an odessey throughout the early modern era with a sympathy and understanding of a world far different then ours in some respects, yet, as Thomas succinctly points out in the conclusion, profoundly similar. No other history book has granted me a deeper sense of understanding about human drives for stability and for explaination in all things. This is a book that grants insight and understanding far beyond its proclaimed subject matter, with positive and sweeping consequences for the objective thinker."
4,Good Pictures but difficult to use,"I have had my Coolpix 5700 for several years and rarely go anywhere without it. It takes great pictures unless there is low light. It is impossible to get decent shots in the late evening or in the house. The controls are pretty complicated, but I leave almost everything on auto and this works most of the time. It is a very tough camera and has taken a LOT of abuse from me (including being dropped on bricks from a few feet up). I love my camera but it is not for the casual user.Buy 2 batteries! Always keep one on the charger and you will be thankful."
2,"slow focus, slow memory, but looks nice & it's nikon",been very disappointed with the camera. i've used to travel to 12 different countries and the pic quality is good but way too slow to capture any large files other than normal and zooms so slow that it is painful. but i am selling mine if you want to buy one.
2,One big failing,"Takes great pictures, but its one big failing is that its painfully s-l-o-w power up and focus makes it useless for candid people shots. My cheap little Casio digicam is three times faster on the draw. I kept Coolpix for a couple of months and then got rid of it. I lost too many shots."
2,Over Rated,"I bought this camera after reading a very positive review in a major ""consumer"" based magazine. 8 months later the image chip went defective. Just as the same ""consumer"" magazine reported in a later issue. Nikon fixed this for ""free"", they would not pay for the incoming shipping ($30).Now 4 months later the flash does not work, the ISO settings do not change, the auto-focus is a no-go.What a piece of junk! Nikon won't pay for these problems either!DO NOT buy! Get the D50 or Rebel XT instead.UPDATE! Nikon has issued a service bulletin for this model. This is the second SERIOUS issue and this piece of junk went back for the second time in its 16 month life.I repeat-do NOT buy! Get the Canon Digital Rebel XT instead!!!"
5,Excellent Camera,Excellent photo quality. Have to read the manual a couple of time to setup camera extra options. Otherwise the default option is more than sufficient.
2,Camera does not work,"This camera does not work properly, it was a waste of money....I bought it for my daughters birthday, she has been ill for a long time and I wanted something she could sit in the garden with and take close up pictures....the camera only works when it wants to...she had a snail climbing in her viewfinder, the light was right, and the camera will not take the picture....so disappointed...I think I was sold a bogus camera...this is my first electronic purchase with Amazon...not happy"
4,I really like this camera!,"I've only had the camera two days, but I'm already enjoying it. I was a little nonplussed to have buttons on the side that are on the back of my 995, but the focus is better, and it takes closeups (at the farthest focal length without going past what's between the W----T. I learned with the 995, and this one is the same, that if you go to 1X, 2X or 4X, etc., you'd better have the camera on a tripod. My 995 doesn't go on a tripod, and it doesn't even have a place to plug in a remote control switch, so I'm glad that this one does. :) I'm going to enjoy this camera very much."
4,"Close to perfect, expensive, a few flaws.","Takes excellent pictures usually. If the picture is not perfect, it is usually a focus problem. The swing out LCD is too small, low res and nearly worthless. The electronic viewfinder could be better. If you want to use the manaul focus its hard to tell when you have it focused accurately because the viewfinder isnt very sharp and there are no measurements (feet or meters) of distance, just a sliding bar. Zoom lens is great. Macro mode (close ups) is outstanding. No low light flash assist. You will need an extra battery and a bigger memory card so put that in your budget if you go for this expensive baby!If you can live without the 8x zoom lens, there are probably better choices where you can get more camera for less money. Otherwise just bite the bullet and try not to whine too much like I do."
2,Awful autofocus--NOT happy with it.,"I'm bringing this camera back in exchange for a Coolpix 4500 tomorrow. The camera is well built, does produce high quality, sharp pictures and has a boatload of features, however the autofocus is horrid. The autofocus doesn't work correctly in anything but bright sunlight. If you're shooting inside under slightly darker than normal conditions, the autofocus just hunts. It's very frustrating when you miss shot after shot because the camera is struggling to autofocus. If you want to stay with the Nikon name, check out the 4500. It's a far better performer."
2,Bad Design,"Nikon 5700 Digital CameraBefore you make a decision to buy the Nikon 5700 camera, consider a badly designed aspect on this camera's view finder. The picture you view through the electronic view finder, lags behind the real image, and it feel like what you see is being dragged across the viewer. In other words, for a fast moving scene, it is almost impossible. Another major draw back is a flare across the view finder. On a sunny day, you won't be able to properly compose a picture more or less when you are facing a bright subject. The view finder presents a wash out with vertical strips across even at low settings of 1SO 100."
2,My Flash Went Bad After Only 2 Months,"Exactly two months ago I bought this camera and spent $$$ upgrading the memory and got a battery pack. Yesterday the flash stopped working. I contacted Nikon and described the symptoms and the rep said to send it in. I had read all the glowing reviews posted here BEFORE I bought the camera and the one review that related a similiar flash problem...I thought his was a fluke.....NOT!!!! We have yet to see if I get my camera back from Nikon in a timely manner and the camera,itself, stays healthy."
3,Nikon Coolpix,this product is dificult to use because many of the features are placed in odd positions of the camera. trying to find a memory card is aslo difficult because the camera is a bit old and can not handle high memory.
5,Fabulous,"Having been an early adopter for digital cameras, I've played with and owned many over the years. My recent purchase of the Nikon 5700 has reignited my love for photography! The camera gives you a ton of control (although I am still learning) and the lens is FABULOUS! I love being able to zoom way in on the subject, frame and focus, and blur out the background the way that this great lens can. The resolution on the resulting image is excellent, and I am very pleased with every image I've had printed at a service provider ...I highly recommend this camera for anyone who loves a little more control with their camera!"
1,Developed Problems in the CCD,"I used this camera for 3months (about 500 shots) and was shocked to see a damaged pixel in the CCD. A red color dot appeared in the shots and the camera became useless.I have sent it to Nikon (through RitzCamera) for repair and it is more then 5 weeks now. No updates on the repair work could be obtained from Nikon/Ritzcamera - very poor customer service given the fact that I have already spent more then $ on this product.I really feel sorry to have spent so much on 5700.Latest: May 14, 2003: I got my CP5700 replaced with a brand new piece. It took me 5 months and 3 shipments (to NikonInc NY), to make this happen."
2,SB & the dreaded flashing red light.,"If your seriously considering one of the pieces of junk, then please go here 1st - http://vowe.net/archives/002211.htmlThis will explain how many many people are a tad disgruntled at Nikon and this know problem. The fact that after a few months the camera will simply refuse to operate with a flash, internal OR external.Do yourselves a favor and buy another brand. The camera is shoddy and the customer support at Nikon is non-existant!"
3,Slow/confused auto focus,"I have always used Nikon 35mm SLR Cameras for my photography hobby and decided to go for a digital and bought coolpix 5700.The camera takes great pictures, but too slow in focusing. it's got lot of features but takes too many buttons to set. while you are trying set up your camera you'll miss your shots. I been taking it mostly in manual mode because, I have hard time getting the correct exposure from program mode, so I use manual, shutter/apature priority.My recommandation is if you are taking moving objects, the camera is way too slow (typical digital camera is slow but I find that it's slower than avg), but if you are taking non moving object such as landscape, it takes excellent pictures. my biggest frustration of using this camera is that it's way toooooooo slow. If I get the correct setting for picture in time, the picture quality is excellent, but main problems is setting the camera up correctly ( or I could in my learning curve)."
4,"Excellent, with limits","This is a very good quality camera in most respects. The optical quality is superb, the zoom is excellent, and the function is fairly intuitive. It is compact and cleanly designed. I have problems in three areas however. As others have noted, the autofocus is annoyingly slow. Also, you cannot raise the flash manually when you know you will need it. Instead, you must depress the shutter button, which results in an unintended flash photo occuring half the time. Lastly, the close focus limit is rather distant making macro photos impossible. Since it too big to fit in a pocket or purse I am looking forward to a suitable carrying case being available. Overall, it is an excellent value."
2,Not the nikon quality I am familiar with....,"I have used Nikon SLR for about 15 years now and I have always admired the quality I get from them. A friend of mine let me play with his new 5700 to see what I think about it.I first asked him the price he paid and although it is abit on the high side, i dismissed it initially and went on to the test if really this camera does deliver relative to its price. Controls are well placed, a nikon quality i like and the materials used are top-notched. However image quality is not what I expected. I have seen and tried digicams from Olympus and Minolta and they have better color reproduction and image saturation. Even the Fuji S7000 seems to have better ""printed image than the Nikon and to think that the Fuji only sells for U$600.00. If the Nikon were priced at least at the level of the others, I would be hard pressed not to reconsider it but it is no very competitive price and feature wise."
1,Don't waste your money on this one.,"Please don't buy this camera. This camera has the WORST auto focus you can imagine. I have used Canon EOS for over a decade. Maybe that is why I believe this camera is sub-standard. For indoor pictures, it takes a few seconds after you press the shutter to take the picture. Try to get a good picture of a young child with a camera like that! Even my 3MP Kodak takes better photos indoors than this one."
2,AF need serious improvement,"I think the camera is ok, interms of picture quality but to get the picture you want would sometime be impossible due to screwed up AF. I tried to take some pictures of kitten that are black and white stripes, and it was imposible to take a decent of kitten it self. if I focus on the kittens, it just won't focus correctly, unless you point at some surrounding object. even than blown up pictures are slightly blurie. when it comes to AF this is one POS. I would recomand this camera if you intend to take pictures of non moving object b/c of slow AF and slow shutter reponse. I have all my 35mm cameras are Nikon and really disappointed that they actually have this POS."
1,Built in flash doesn't work!!!,"I request a change of the first camera because the built in flash did not work,the same thing happened with the replacement, Nikon service suport center answered me saying that I have to send the camera for repairment!! I am returning back because that camera has a big problem with the built in flash!!! I recommend not to buy this camera, DIGITAL COOLPIX 5700 FROM NIKON."
4,Color Print Film is Dead,"The 8x zoom and 5 megapixels finally lured me from film about 6 months ago. I am a nature/landscape photographer using medium and large format, and gave up my 35mm equipment a few years ago. I just came back from a month long trip to the Antarctic, and the prints I've made from the Nikon are sharp,in focus, and colorful. Plusses: very good lens, great zoom, excellent meter compensation for different light levels (think ice); good color balance; good beginner photo software;a heckuva lot lighter than a view camera. Minuses: shutter lag is annoying for action shots; forget the digital zoom; automatic preview gets in the way of repeated shots (can be overridden); buy an extra battery. Overall: This is a great little camera with the right mix of automatic features for the beginner, but with plenty of options to appeal to the more advanced (and particular) photographer. Put it on a tripod and it's awesome. Well worth the price premium over lesser offerings."
4,Good camera - trains the photographer,"If you are willing to learn about photography and how to use a real camera - the 5700 coolpix is for you. I have had this camera and both love and hate it.The reasons are:1. It takes great pictures if you learn how to operate the camera. For me, it was often out of frustration that compelled me to take better photographs.2. It made me a better photographer because I was forced to learn what Shutter priority, Aperture priority, White Balance are.3. The EVF (electronic view finder) is horrific in the dark - You are literally shooting in the dark.4. Battery consumption is horrendous - get the MB-E5700 battery grip!"
2,Internal flash stopped working,"After a few months, the internal flash on my 5700 stopped working. I've been researching this issue on the web and I am definitely not the only one who has this problem. Getting this problem fixed by Nikon will cost you $250 - $300. I was not a big user of the flash in the first place but it is a huge disappointment to have a problem with such a basic feature on a ""prosumer"" camera. I have also had miserable results with the auto-focus in low light conditions. This is another common complaint about this camera. Now I wish that I had bought a Canon."
5,Great Camera,I love my coolpix camera. It is very easy to use and close to professional quality. Great Job Nikon!
1,Lemon Camera,"Do not buy this camera. After using it for 3 months I got ""lens Error"". It can't even focus on low light condition. When you pressed the shutter , it will take at least 3 to 4 sec to take the shot. I called Nikon for service , and they replaced it with a new one. Adviced is do not buy this Nikon 5700 . Lemon ... Lemon ... Lemon ...How about Olympus...?"
1,What a Joke?,"Although it is a great camera, I rate it with only ONE star because of the way it is sold! If it is a joke, it is certainly a very bad one! I do not wish to give ant information about myself to find out about the price! Instaed of wasting my tame to play this stupid game, I prefer to right here on what I think about this silly method! I was and am interested in purchasing this camera, but before making any decision, I have to know the price, which I still do NOT know! If you wish to play this stupid game, them there must be something fishy, and then, so long!"
1,Claiming His Family,"UghI have read two books and never finished third because they are the same exact story except character names are changed. Every plot is exact...the villian is in jail and get out on technically...victims are the one who put him in jail...heroine has love interest with personality flaws and the same insecurities and the end is wrapped up with the same bow. I couldn't get past the second chapter of this one, the third book I bought. It seems if you've read one you've read them all."
1,bad quality watch.,"i made a big mistake not purchasing this watch with amazon,i would have returned it.the only thing going for it is it;s size.digital display is useless almost unreadable, the same applies to the bezel only worse, the back light could be allot better.when buying a watch don't go by how it looks in a photo. as i have said buy your watches from amazon. spend some extra money as the cheap ones will only disappoint you."
4,"Great buy, Beautiful appearance, good functions","When I open the box I surprised, looks much better than in pictures. Bright, solid, beautiful and shine mineral crystal, beautiful satin bracelet.I enjoy his functions and easy to operate. His bidirectional E6B pilot's slide rule is very functionally, if you never have use it, you can learn in few minutes with easy examples in manual.I recommend it for practically people that enjoy the technology. (and heavy wearing watch)The reason I don't qualify with 5 stars is because the alarm sound is too low, the backlight is not enough brightness and it's impossible to synchronize the digital time with the analog time."
3,Pulsar flight computer review,The watch keeps relatively good time but critcism must be levelled at the fact that the literature states that the watch has a screw-in crown. This is not so and the watch could possibly leak if immersed in water.The other hassle is that it's difficult if not impossible to synchronise the analog and the digital readings. I have tried several times and have not been able to get this right.Time will also tell how durable this watch really is. I can say that I am not impressed with it.
5,Excellent watch,"I'm pretty picky when it comes to watches. I never really liked to use them, but this one I'm enjoying it a lot. Like the other reviews says it's a little heavy, but that's okay, it doesn't really bother me. It's a nice watch, looks like much more expensive then the 80 bucks it costs, never had a problem with it and it's definally a keeper.On a functional level, the only complaint is that the digital and analog displays drift in sync depending on the time. However, I liked the way you change the time, if you miss the right time you can use other button to go backwards, not just forward like the normal watches. (Example, you want to set to 7:35, you just missed, you are in 7:37 now, you can use the back button to go back to 7:35, no need to go all the way to 00 again.).It's good also if you are a overseas traveller you don't need to keep changing the time, just change the time zone and that's it.Highly recomended if you are looking for a inexpensive watch that works."
4,Nice Watch... A little on the bulky side though,Great Watch! The watch weighs more than most watches i'm used to.
2,Too expensive & not durable,"I purchased this as a gift for my fiance, but after sometime the light inside the watch would not turn on.... & we have to pay $30.00 to repair it & it would stil do the same thing... it was very embarrassing for me.."
4,nice watch for the price,"I really liked this watch.Though it is not equal to the standards of other wathches by seiko, but it's really good for the price.Some drawbacks-The dot matrix display is not very readable,and the backlight is also quite dim.The alarm sounds quite faint (i don't use it neways).But overall, a very nice watch to have."
3,like it !!,"Got mine today. First thought, its heavy!!! compared to my Ironman.Spend the last hour playing with it. The side keys are a little insensitve, had to press hard to change settings.The digital display is a little dim. The manual couldnt be anymore useless...I have CST on the analog and DEL(DELHI, INDIA) on the digit after some fumbling.Overall I like the watch for its features and is worth the money."
1,Pulsar PM7001 - Flight Computer Watch,"I have to agree with all the negative remarks about this watch. I too am a cargo pilot who bought this watch for use a night (when I happen to fly the most). It's fairly good to look at, but totally useless when it comes to reading and accessing the time at night! I depend more on the built-in clocks on my GPS and Nav systems than on this watch. Combine all the negatives with the fact that it's made in China...and I'd have to advise against purchasing this watch. Keep looking."
4,Choose another one,"This watch is really good. But, it has one big deficiency, the analog watch and the digital watches are not synchronized. In detail, the analog watch is getting earlier every day. I think if I do not synchronize them once a week, after a year, analog watch will catch the digital one. So, which one I should follow? Analog or digital one, which one is the correct one?The other things are great. But what I expect from a watch is to show me the time correctly and to show me only 1 time, not the option of two different times."
4,Pulsar Watch Review,"I liked this watch as soon as I saw it at Amazon. This is the watch I wear when I go out of town. I've owned lots of watches, Timex, Citizen, Bulova,Invicta and others and the Pulsar is my favorite. I like the light display which is nice to have in a dark theater or other dark places. Also, this watch has single alarm mode and regular alarm mode which is nice to have. The watch has 24 Hrs countdown timer. The Citizen watches I have only have a 60 minute countdown timer. I think the Pulsar easier to set up than the Citizen Navihawk, The Pulsar has a nice feel when I wear it. The Citizen Navihawk and other aviator watches might have reputation but the Pulsar you get more bang for the buck."
2,"All beauty, No brains","I'm a great fan of chronograph watches because I like the way they look. I don't really know how to use that feature and I dont even care. Having said that... I bought this watch purely based on looks... And I still like the way it looks. Its just that in over an year, I have started to dislike it more than its looks can compensate for.So here are the things that I hate:-First and foremost, the battery died on me in about 1 year - which is unacceptable for a watch in this price range.-The quickest way to tell an expensive watch apart from a cheap look-alike is by looking at the metal strap. While the metal strap here is not exactly flimsy, its not hefty enough too.-Switching from winter to summer time is more complicated than it should beTo summarize things, I paid $125 for this watch and I don't feel that I got my money's worth. I wouldn't recommend this watch to anyone. Sure it looks great, but there are plenty better looking options out there."
2,after 18 months it's dead,"I liked this watch for the first year. It had little flakinesses, but did what I wanted and wasn't terribly expensive. But recently the buttons got too sticky to work any longer. I can't adjust it without a pair of pliers to pull the buttons back out after pressing them. Then yesterday the analog hands just stopped. I can't get them going again. Possible the battery is low, but the digital portion is going fine and it's not old enough that the battery should be going. I'm going back to Casio's products, which always lasted me at least twice this long."
4,Great watch with a few problems.,"Bought this one after trying on the Citizen Skyhawk. Its much cheaper, and has features that I would use more: Larger digital displays and a backlight.On a functional level, the only complaint is that the digital and analog displays drift in sync.Also, dont know if its just my watch, but the metal band squeaks pretty often and is getting annoying.Over all, this is a keeper."
4,good watch for the price,"This 7001 watch is a good size watch, quite sturdy and/but heavy.It does look funky cool with a curved glass.The analog and digital parts have no connection at all, so all the time zone, stop watch, alarm etc. are all digital functions.Digital read out is not that clear (hard to read at certain angles). Backlight is kind of dim and alarm is not loud (don't use it as the alarm clock).For the date /day function, you can only select either the month or day or date. The resolution of the dot matrix display (top) is kind of low quality.Bracelet is sturdy, edge is smooth.Made in China.Quality is not up to the seiko ana-digi standard but it is good quaility for the price (especially I paid $80 delivered). .Not perfect, but good watch for the money.I am happy with the purchase."
5,"Nice watch, good value","I liked this watch from the get go. It's great looking and has a nice feel to it. Is it heavier than alot of watches out there? yes. Am I leaning to one side because of the weight? no. As for the ease of use I had no problem at all. The manual walks you through everything, and as long as you can read there should be no problem. Others reported having problems with the back lighting and alarm volume. I can honestly say that I don't agree. I can see everything with a push of the button. The alarm isn't that loud but then again, I don't plan on using any watch for an alarm clock"
2,Pulsar Men's Tech Gear Flight Computer Watch #PM7001,"Sent it back. Main reason: digital display is only visible lit up in the dark. Photography in the ad made it looked great, but it isn't practical in normal lighting. Also, has a standard battery with 2 years life expectancy quoted, I believe. These days, and for the price and quality of this watch, I expect much longer, up to 10 years."
5,Magical Surprise,I just recently discovered the Leafy seadragon and the Weedy seadragon. Never knew they existed. My students and I have been studying them. I just happened to come upon these toys while searching for books and I was so excited!. They are well made and so fun! Thank you for producing them. Excellent value!
5,Good for bunny nails,I bought these to trim my pet rabbit's nails.The shelter we adopted him from said the scissor type worked best.They did fine.I have different clippers for the dog and cats.They are all Bamboo brand and seem to be of quality. Glad I got these and would recommend for small nails.
5,Bamboo Cat Nail Scissors,"These are excellent cat nail scissors. They cut cleanly, leaving no jagged edges on the claws. Very pleased with these scissors."
3,attractive and comes with everything you need but blades are dull,"The title of this review pretty much sums it up: This kit comes with styptic powder for accidental bleeding, a file to dull sharp edges, and scissors, but the scissors are somewhat dull and have split a bit of my kitty's nails. Will be replacing in the near future."
2,so-so,"These clippers are so-so. They're not very sharp, so the angle has to be just right to cut. Ok if your feline doesn't mind keeping her paw still. Not good if you have rambunctious kitties like mine. Spend a couple dollars more for a better pair."
5,Great price for an alternate to the Fuji Battery,I purchased these for Chumby's that were being given as Christmas gifts. The work perfect.
5,Another Chumby Based Review,Powers my Chumby for a pretty good amount of time without a wall socket. If I had to pin the exact run time I'd say roughly an hour and a half at visible during the daytime brightness or two hours at minimum brightness.
2,Kevin Federline's Brother?,"K-Fed even looks like Robin Thicke. Don't you think?I'm a member of a music club and in a misguided attempt to live dangerously, I decided to order a cd from an artist I knew absolutely nothing about. From the cover, I thought I was ordering a cd from a woman. I received the cd, looked in the sleeve and much to my horror, saw this hippie looking dude with long stringy hair. If that wasn't bad enough, I listen to the cd and realize I do know who he is. He's the dork in that music video who was riding his bike in the busy city streets of NYC where even Russell Simmons was kind enough to make a cameo appearance.The music isn't bad, just forgettable. I listened to it twice and had absolutely no desire to listen to it ever again. At least with other music that has to grow on you, it gives you some inkling of promise that forces you to return. Not this though.Bottom line: Mediocre music from a guy who needs a haircut. I recommend Justified instead."
3,DECENT,"Songwriter Robin Thicke's debut cd is a blend of funk, hip hop, r&b and even a little alternative rock.The cd is a bit uneven, but the good points outway the bad. The funky first single ""When i get you alone"" is one of those good points. The opener ""Oh Shooter"" with it's ribbing baseline and THICKE'S subdued vocal catch the listener's ear immediately.The other standouts include the ""Flowers in bloom"", the neo-soul ""Brand New Jones"" and ""Suga Mama""However, silly songs like ""Shes Gangsta"" and ""Make a baby"" are downright played and could have been released in 1994. All in All a decent debut by this artist who is not getting alot of push from his label or main stream radio. Hopefully we'll get a second release from this artist, who with a little growth can only get better!"
5,Robing Thicke Beautiful World,"This was a good investment and Amazon.com made it a smooth and quick transaction.Thank you,Christine Maldonado"
4,I love this guy!,"Love Oh Shooter, and it's ""remake"", Shooter, but to a lesser extent. I am not the biggest fan of Lil Wayne; he's unattractive, everywhere and his music doesn't hit the spot.But the good songs don't even end there:Beautiful World (insight, sadness, misery) I'm A Be Alright, The Stupid Things, When I Get You Alone, Flowers In Bloom, Lazy Bones and Suga Mama earn his smooth vocals a 4+ star rating.I can't wait to hear from him again. He's great!Standouts:Oh ShooterA Beautiful WorldThe Stupid ThingsLazy Bones4+ stars."
4,A lil somethin for everyone,"Once you get pass the shock that Thicke's father is the dad off of Growing Pains, you can really begin to enjoy his music. The range he shows in his music is impressive. For most of the public, they would like to place a label on his music. Is it R&B, POP, or Alternative? It's just music, man. The biggest problem that Thicke has is his label. With little airplay, and postpone release dates, I hope he can at least make gold. later."
2,A Major Disappointment,I was disappointed with this album and that was probably because I listened to Evolution first. I wish I could send it back. Maybe it will grow on me in time. This doesn't fall into a single category within the music industry. Maybe I will give it another listen in a few years.
1,Vanilla Ice Redux,"Someone did some serious lying to Robin Thicke during the production of ""A Beautiful World."" From the ""Po' Pimp of the Year"" outfit he sports in the photo on the back of the jewel case - to the ridiculously bad songs recorded- he should have just said no. Can you spell Vanilla Ice? Where was Dre when he was needed? If he has any sense, Robin Thicke will buy up every copy he can find and make sure they are destroyed quick, fast, and in a hurry. I bought the cd based upon other reviews, listened to 8 bars of each song and tossed it in the trash. Buy the real music he puts out on the Evolution of Robin Thicke and give ""A Beautiful World"" to folks you can't stand. I can't think of a more appropriate gift."
2,Not up to snuff,"If you think Thicke is the next credible blue-eyed soul brother, think again. His material is dim-witted and contrived. It's okay for a 30-second Sprite ad, but not much else."
4,Like Justin without dancin',"Sounds like Mr. Timberlake but has now ability to dance, painfully white! Looking forward to the new album."
5,Blue Eyed Soul,I believe every great album has to separate itself from others. This album definately seperated itself from this years pop/RnB albums. Classic soul oozes out of every track. Stevie Wonder and Curtis Mayfield should be proud of the offspring they have created in Thicke. No two songs on the album sound alike and none of the songs seem to be written by today's hit making industry. Thicke has stayed true to the style of music he enjoys and true to the true passion of music. I definately feel as though Thicke has made a true work of art and an album that will stand the test of time.
2,"Whoa! not the good kind of ""whoa""","I would recommend finding ""other"" sources to listen to this album rather than buying it. If your like me, in which I listened to his 2nd album ""the evolution of robin thicke"" FIRST, then you will find that this album is poorly done.He is a singer who has a beautiful magnetic voice singing HIGH notes. Sounds sooooo sexy when he does. More of the high notes were done on his 2nd album. This album is a ""pass"""
4,Thicke got a huge talent....,"this album is well worth your money. Robin thicke is an extremely talented artist, in every way. he writes, produce, sing, everything!the album is packed with many many fun songs, fastpaced ones, and also a couple of more slow-ones. but, hey, all of them are great with no exeption!!!Favourites though will have to be: Suga mama, when i get you alone, brand new jones, lazy bones, the latin song (forgot it's name... its the 9th song...) , and many more- but these are the highlights.buy it!"
4,Thicke Never Thin,This album is solid from beginning to end. I have been waiting for it to drop for quite some time now. The release date was pushed back many times and the name of the album was changed. It was worth the wait. Lyrics are more clever than in depth. Great delivery. This album is difficult to classify like Nikka Costa (another great album). I was dissapointed to find that there were no bonus tracks. That is usually a given. This is a great album.
3,heads up,"I actually enjoyed his 2nd CD before I bought this one. The 1st and 2nd is night and day difference between the two. This album gives more of a pop/rock tempo while the 2nd CD is warmer, smoother, and makes you think about those you may love more. ""Beautiful World"" is not a bad CD by far, but it gives a different vibe. If you are like me and listened to ""Evolution"" before ""Beautiful World"" you may not be too interested in Thicke's approach on ""Beautiful World."""
4,The Triple Nickles - An Unforgotten Chapter in Black History,"We were lucky enough to get this book at a Black Educators Conference, but had the sad, but familiar, experience of wanting to share with a young man for inspiration -- and never seeing it again.The book is written for young adults, but can keep the interest of adults reading it. It tells the story of the first Black paratroop squadron, which served in WWII. As was similar in many of the early US military/minority encounters, these men were trained to fight but then given kitchen duty. Eventually they were given a chance with the 82nd Airborne and went on to have many successful missions.I found the book to be inspiring and humbling. It would do both blacks and whites good to read it to remember how things were, and not sugarcoat history."
1,didn't work,Twice this watch came with a dead battery. They need to learn to pull the winding stem out while it's sitting on the shelf in some wearhouse.
3,Not bad Not great,"Right away, the kids had fun with this. Not sure if it has legs though. It's fun a few times butit's not that challenging. A good first board game though. So, this is just okay."
5,It was for my grandson and he is enjoying it immensely!!!,"I bought this for my grandson's birthday. I live a long way from him so I haven't actually seen the game, but he said that he is having fun playing it!"
5,"just as advertised, perfect, shipped quickly, no problems","just as advertised, perfect, shipped quickly, no problems, we love Meatloaf, so this will be a welcome addition to the library"
2,bad DVD,Everytime I play this DVD gets stuck in one spot. I would send it back but it would cost more than what I paid for it.
1,Horrible,"This DVD contains only 5 songs, which is considered a 'concert'? and the quality is awful. I do not recommend it to anyone."
4,music review,just to say i am a fan of music. i love meat loaf. i didnt have any old dvds of his concerts. i purchased this one as i read some others who have bought it. well its a good concert. the only thing i was disappointed about was karla devito. i felt she was a little behind in the music. i feel patty russo works better with meat and love her voice and candid playfulness.Thanks Thomas...
3,Not As Advertised,"I enjoyed this DVD very much, but like the person who posted before me I was disappointed that it wasn't as advertised. The show was shorter than listed on Amazon and there were no covers of 'Johnny B Goode' and 'River Deep, Mountain High'. Other than that, the concert footage was quite enjoyable."
1,Not as Advertised,"The DVD was supposed to include ""River Deep, Mountain High"" and ""Johnny B. Goode"". They were not on the DVD I received."
4,Between Rockabilly and Folk,"This 1986 release by Dave Alvin backed by the Allnighters and featuring guests like Al Kooper and David Hidalgo is firmly on the road between his Blasters and X days and his more recent folkier work like Blackjack David and Public Domain. The cool part is he's been great all along the way and this outing, his first solo work, is great, too. It has cuts that showed up elsewhere like Fourth of July which X did and Alvin redid himself on King of California. They're strong songs, and hearing them recast is a treat, and those unique to this disk are fine, too..In the liner notes Alvin says this is his first time out singing his songs. Why he waited so long I don't know, but he does fine.Strong songs, good singing, and inspired playing. Next best thing to saturday night."
4,Great band music,Loved this cd! Became interested by watching Kurth on General Hospital. This cd contains many different types of songs. I enjoy all of them and find that everyone else that listens to the cd does also.
2,"A day in the life of John, the 'folks' at Cambridge, and the BBC","Briefly I am a huge John Sebastian fan and have been for many decades. I have all of his recordings. This recording is described in detail as 2 sets from the Cambridge folk festival in 1981.Most of the tunes will be familiar. What i miss is the stage chatter-there is some, but not much. This adds insight into the performer, flavor, humor, and intimacy to these type of recordings. Theres not much here (compared to Real Live John Sebastian, for example).I also will mention that the recordings have a 'one trick pony' aspect to the sound-ie John on acoustic or electric-solo. Its a bit lack luster. One reviewer mentioned the technical quality of the BBC live recording as below par. I didn't find this detrimental, but, I did find the performance a bit plain due to the lack of other instruments. I urge anyone to listen before they buy to see if its your cup of tea. Im sure Ill not be listening to this frequently or repeatedly."
3,Good idea but should have checked all contributors,"The New Geneva Study Bible was a great idea. But the editors should have checked the background and sentiments of all the contributors. One contributor, Joe Trafton of Western Kentucky University, has views very much at odds with the original Reformers of Geneva. He contributed to the Pastoral letters. But he is a member of the Catholic Biblical Association and committed to not criticizing Rome. Calvin would spin in his grave!"
4,comprehensive... almost,"This book was recommended by a friend who has extensive experience in the consumer goods industry. It was an interesting read, as I'm a fan of Hello Kitty as well as a business school graduate. The authors do a good job of explaining a lot of the background regarding how Sanrio got to where it is today.One of the things I hoped this book would answer is the question of why Sanrio would distribute its products through a mass retailer like Target. It never even came close to this issue; I'm still curious to know Sanrio's strategy with Target.I agree with Tristan Beaulieu that the later chapters begin to repeat content from earlier chapters. I'm not sure if this is because it was written by two authors and simply wasn't integrated well enough. Also, some of the earlier chapters refer to vignettes coming later in the book, but it turns out to be a letdown when most of the story has already been revealed by its earlier reference."
4,The Story of Hello Kitty,"If you are a Hello Kitty fan you might want to know more about how it all got started. Sometimes repetitious, but still fun to read if you are a Hello Kitty fan, this book provides tons of information about Sanrio and Hello Kitty and her makers. It is an interesting story. Did you know Bill Gates tried to buy the copywrite to Hello Kitty? A fun read. Good for summer relaxing or rainy days in a blanket. It will make you love Kitty White even more (if that is possible!)!"
3,Great concept - poorly written.,"I am a huge fan of the Sanrio company and everything it creates and I received this book for Christmas. The writing style is typical of a high school student's book report. The same facts are repeated over and over, making half the book seem like filler. The same numbers and figures and statements are constantly repeated. In short, the book could have been about 30 pages long without the filler.It backtracks a lot also. It feels like every chapter is written by a new writer who was told to research Hello Kitty (like I said, it repeats). I wish it would have had a more linear style, from beginning to end.The facts are very interesting though, and learning about the creator was also a nice treat."
4,little better than the junk out there,"I was searching for high availability options while implementing SQL servers. On this subject matter, this book is much better than many of 'mastering', 'unleashing' books which dont even talk about those topics. The writing flow is OK, performance suggestions are better, but, still I feel it is not in-depth for an experienced DBA. I would give a 3.5 for this book. It is a useful book, but not a must-have."
1,Not what I was expecting at all,"I just returned this because it is the worst Sql Server book I have ever read. It is full of bad advice and generalizations. The book tries to tell you that it doesn't get into details because it assumes only experienced DBAs will read it, but the real story is that it glosses over lots of important details and doesn't tell you anything that isn't already in the books online. Just a terrible, terrible book."
2,"The title is miss-leading, it is for beginner.","It is for beginner without details. I was excited about the title and ordered a copy but very disappointed after I read it. No scenarios, no DOs and DONTs. For that matter, his previous book Admin 911 may be better."
5,Children's Bible,The Bible is a book for the young and the old. This book contains in the words of the King James Bible the stories whioch time has proved to be the most interesting and inspiring to youth of all ages. This book is an everyday book for children With its beautiful stories and illustrations.
1,Caution !,"Take caution with buying Operating Software on Amazon.I would advise anyone attempting to buy an Operating System over the internet to think three times about your decision. There are a gamet of scamers out there selling unregisterable copies of Microsoft Operating System Products. If the site you are trying to buy the software from does not list the company name, or seller name, or company address, or telephone number you should be weary of getting involved. I made a recent purchase of a Microsoft O.S. product only to find out that it was a copy never meant for the general public and was not registerable with Microsoft. I did manage to get my money back and send the product back to the seller. I would advise you to buy locally on this kind of product."
2,"Despite good press, this movie is one of the worst ever made","After reading about how wonderful this movie was, I decided to rent it from a video store. To my surprise, the movie was completely opposite of what I expected. The beginning was boring and slow. The characters were great, but the story just wasn't. The relationship between Dil and ""Jimmy"" is so confusing, I don't understand how they could possibly *love* one another. Also, how could ""Jimmy"" not notice that Dil was not a man? The facial features were so obvious. I wouldn't waste your time on this movie. Just listen to Boy George's ballad ""The Crying Game"". It sums up what the movie is in about 3 minutes."
1,Oh god please make it stop.,I've got a spoiler so if you don't want to look at a spoiler look away right now O.K. here's the spoiler: this movie sucks big time.
4,brutally sensitive,"This is not a movie about the IRA. It is not a usual love story either. It is definitely not an action movie. The Crying Game is a little strange, a little lost but still out there, it certainly is the type of movie you'd like to watch if you are bored of the usual Hollywood. It is also a must see for Neil Jordan fans. Some extraordinary performances by Jaye Davidson (wherever she is now!) and Stephen Rea. Definitely touching..."
5,Great Movie,Have been searching for this movie for quite some time. I liked it when it first came out and it's just as good now.
2,Inadequate presentation,"International customers, please note: this is the version for Puritans, with Jaye Davidson's naughty bits blacked out. As a result, one pivotal scene loses 90% of its punch. Also, on the technical side, there are compression and NTSC artefacts galore, especially in the opening shot. (The film itself rates 5 stars.)"
3,Great movie but horrible DVD transfer!,"I think it was a great movie but a horrendous job of transfering it to a DVD. Not only that, but no subtitles were given which is standard for DVD's. A big disappointment so please do not buy this DVD since this will only encourage the cheapskate studios to continue releasing subpar DVDs."
2,I'm buying a another DVD - this one is crap,The movie itself is great - one of my favorites of all time - which is probably why I can't watch this unbelievably crappy DVD. I have some stinkers in my collection but this one sits right at the bottom. The picture quality is akin to an old weathered VHS. Find any other version to watch if at all possible.
4,strange,"this is a most unusual movie. learned about he english/irish situation. understand it a lot more, was fooled by the very unexpected ""surprise"" very good movie over all. forest whittaker did an excellent job."
3,I thought it was a very twisted love affair.,I thought this movie was fair. In the begining its hard to follow. But if you pay close attention it starts to come together. It's a movie that is full of shocking surprises and a twisted love affair. Get ready to be in shock is the mystery unfolds!!!!
2,"Good movie, but a poor presentation.","""The movie with the secrets"" is a good movie with a terrific cast, but the DVD-edition of the movie is sadly very poor. The images look blocky and compressed and the sound, only presented in DD 2.0-format, lacks punch. There is not any extra material except for the trailer - not even subtitles, which makes it a little difficult to view the movie, as the characters mainly speak Irish. Movie/Sound/Picture/Extra: 3.5/2/2/1"
3,A great movie if it's whats your looking for,a good movie but no plot and i got bored in the middle besides that goo
4,not great,i liked this moviebecause it did have originality but the movie went by very slow. that's the only flaw.
2,A Would-Be Theatrical Triumph,"When I watched this movie at the time it was released in theaters, I did not like it. Then I watched it on HBO last year, and it was OK, but still not very good. The soundtack is good, even if not very original. My problem is that without Dil's shocking nude scene and sexual innuendo throughout this movie, the whole thing would have been completely bland and ordinary. Why should you care about the characters in this film? Because most of them are violent and dangerous people and some of them are of ambiguous [...]? And the worn-our scorpion tale told from prison at the end of this movie? I am sorry, but this movie plays on its shock value, and that's where it exhausts itself.I felt that the Irish issues was merely used as a backdrop here, some would say abused, for the purpose of making some statement based on an obscene scene. The acting was good. And I have a lot of respect for Miranda Richardson, but the cast cannot save this would-be tale about the power of love."
2,give me a break!!,"this film is terrible!! i don't get why people keep saying it is a good film. i was excited when i got the chance to see it,especially because of all that Oscar nominations and a wonderfull cast.The begginning is exciting and i was really enjoying, but after the character of Stephen Rea meets ""jill"" it becomes boring,stupid and confusing.I don't get why all this crtical acclaim."
3,.,"I found the first half-hour of this film riveting, and the rest of it lukewarm and confusingly bleak. I can certainly respect it for being (for the most part) well-made, unflinchingly original, and strongly performed. I also have to give it credit for the tangible, bewildering, and unsettling dream-like atmosphere it evokes. But although I have no problem with ""bleak"" movies, if you will, every once in a while I'll see one that comes off as bleak in a way that leaves me feeling bored and empty rather than touched, meaningfully disturbed, or moved. The Crying Game is such a film. A flawed and somewhat silly ending didn't help. Critically I don't have many qualms with the film on the whole, but at the same time, I can't say I felt like I gained much of anything from seeing it, other than a very detached respect for the talent involved and an oppressive feeling of dull, unenriched numbness."
5,A great movie plus all the extras,"I think this a wonderfully written movie and the actors did a great job. Jaye Davidson had never acted before but done an outstanding performance. Stephen Rea and Miranda Richardson and the whole crew were absolutely great! This is a must see movie and the collector's edition is a must own. It has an alternative ending, trailors, the making of the movie, which I am very glad I got to see. This movie has alot to offer the audience, Kidnapping of a soldier and cleverly befriending one of his captors to do something for him if he is killed. The picure takes on alot of twist and turns that makes this movie one of the best pictures of its time. I highly recommend the collector's edition. I watch ever chance I get and I think it gets better each time."
5,The Crying Game by rh,"I heard about The Crying Game when Jaye Davidson won an Oscar for his Perfomance. I bought the Movie when it came out on VHS. I liked it so much I decided to purchase the DVD version. It is a little Offbeat, but is an exceptional Movie. would reccommend for anyone over 17."
4,Great movie,"I saw this movie when it came out in 1993. Its not for everyone and is a strong ""R"" movie but keeps you guessing."
4,Good DVD,At first I trashed this DVD. Then I gave a good sympathetic listen. Very good. A strong individual and player and best of all she reflects the Japanese culture. This is very accessable music and still is very good.
4,Keiko Matsui in a small venue,"This provides an excellent opportunity to witness the amazing talents of this gifted lady; however, some of her arranging talents are lost in the smaller setting / group.Still, an excellent performance.The Jazz Channel Presents Keiko Matsui (BET on Jazz)"
2,Difficult to install,"I have a smooth round knob in my bathroom which I found was difficult to get a grip on and to turn.I had a hard time installing this product because there was not enough room between the product and the door to use the wrench properly. So I had to move the product off center in order to remove the wrench. Consequently I was not able to tighten it very tight.I am afraid that the product will slip on the door knob and that someone in the bathroom could be trapped in there. I left the wrench in the bathroom but I don't know if I could talk someone through using it from the outside of the door. I will use it for a while, but I may take it off because of this shortcoming."
2,too similar to Still Waters,"The first book I read by this author was Still Waters and there are too many similarities between that story and the one in Night Sins. A dark haired woman moves to a small town in MN. She finds herself irresistably drawn to the chief of police. They try not to get involved but, of course, they end up in bed. There is a jealous colleague and rumors abound in the small town. Blah blah blah...too much of the same in each book.I picked up Ashes to Ashes, Still Waters, Night Sins and Guilty as Sin at a used bookstore. I'm from Mpls. and enjoy if when there are references to a place I know. I read Ashes to Ashes first and enjoyed it. Still Waters was okay. I'm going to read Guilty as Sin because I have it, not because I really care about the characters."
4,A suspense mystery worth reading,Night Sins offers a decent twisting plot will good characters and a well planned ending. Held my attention throughout and was not overly predictable. Definitley worth reading.
3,"A little light reading, despite the subject matter","Tami Hoag made her living writing romance novels before she switched her focus, and it shows in ""Night Sins"". Raise your hand if you knew Megan and Mitch would end up sleeping together! Her descriptions are romance novel stock-in-trade, and the plot was predictable. Hoag's strength, however, is in her dialogue--she knows what she's doing there, and that's what kept me reading. Romance readers looking for a step up can start with Tami Hoag--a nice beach or plane read."
2,Long romance,"As far as plot movement is concerned, the 650 pages contain within them a 150-page story. The rest consists of enough filler to make Charles Dickens blush-- too bad Hoag is no Dickens. Be prepared to slog through 1200 pages, because the mystery herein is not revealed until at least the end of the sequel, Guilty As Sin-- but then again if mystery is what you are looking for you can stop reading now.This is a really a rather repetitive, unrealistic romance. I've read (or, to be more clear, skimmed) several Hoag books and the formula she hashes out in work over work: Tough career woman gets beat down, realizes her dreams of career were hollow, turns crying to her alpha male and accepts role as happy housewife.650 pages. Yawn."
1,Waste of time,"This is my first and definately last Tami Hoag book. Most of the characters were annoying and vulgar and should use have their mouths washed out with soap. The identity of the villain was predictable and the final fate of the kidnapped child seemed rather unlikely. If you are looking for a cheap Harlequin type novel disguised as a thriller, this book is for you. If you want a better quality book, I'd advise you to save your money and skip this book. If I could give this book less than 1 star I would."
3,Say What?,"I stayed with this book for the pay-off. I wanted, like most readers of crime fiction, to see the bad guy get got, the good guy get the girl. So far so good. But when I turned the final pages, Hoag lost me, probably for good.I won't spoil it for you, but the ending is a pretty big disappointment. Even Hoag's attempt to placate the reader with a post-Epilogue epilogue didn't mitigate my displeasure, and may have even reinforced it with an obvious attempt to get me to buy the sequel to find answers to questions this book should have answered for me.I liked the pace, I liked the characters, I liked the writing. But the ending was pure cop-out (no pun intended), and left lots of loose ends dangling in the breeze."
1,Caricatures rather than characters,"If you like your characters stereotyped - the downtrodden, ground-breaking female detective with parental and trust issues; the strong, grieving chief of police; the narcissistic sheriff; the interfering media; and of course desperate parents and obvious bad guys - this is the book for you. Top it off with an ending that requires reading a sequel, and you have the makings of frustrating read, very similar to the sexual tension she attempts to build between the protagonists.Sure Hoag writes well but that does not compensate for characters you get sick of in a place you don't care about orbiting around unresolved ""mystery."""
1,Disappointed,"Tami Hoag is a skilled author who typically crafts well-written and exciting stories that totally grab my attention and keep right up until the final page. Unfortunately, in Night Sins, she fell far short of her mark.The book starts out with a prologue that sets the scene for a thrilling suspense novel. That thrilling suspsense novel never materializes. The plot is okay, the characters are okay, the twists and turns are not unexpected...the entire book never moves past the okay mark until you reach the ending. The ending is nothing short of lazy. It feels very much as if this author grew bored with her own story and decided to wrap it up as quickly as possible so she could move on to other things. My question is, if the author grew bored with her story, why does she think it's acceptable to sell it to her readers?Do yourself a favor and skip this one. It's not worth the time it took to be disappointed by this author's failure with this particular story."
1,Terrible writing....,"I had read a couple other books by Tami Hoag before I read Night Sins - Prior Bad Acts and Kill the Messenger. I enjoyed both; they were well written with everything I would expect in a good mystery/suspense novel. Wow - what in the world happened here??? This book is so poorly written, with incredibly redundant diolog, and adult characters whose emotional behavior is equivalent to teenagers, or even worse, preteens. The ONLY reason I kept reading the book was to find out whether they find Josh or not. To tell you how bad it was, I was able to read the first few words of a paragraph and completely get the drift...everything else was just ""filler words"" after that, stating the same facts or thoughts over and over again. Ive read a lot of novels and I have to say, this is some of the worst writing I have ever run into. I don't know what happened to Ms. Hoag here, butI would not recommend that you bother with this book! You'll be wasting your time."
1,UNFINISHED NIGHT SINS;,"Hoag did not finish the book; she left too many questions unanswered, She needs to write another epilogue to complete what she left unfinished. This is a bestseller??? NOT RECOMMENDED"
4,absolutely incredible: exciting and compelling,I am a lover of Mary Higgins Clark books and ran out of them. In comes Amazon.com with a recomendation of Night Sins -- Yes what a great discovery. Not only have I discovered a fabulous book but a great mystery writer as well. Tthis book grabs you up front and twists and turns its way into an ending that leaves you wanting more. It deals with the difficult subject of Child molestation without weaving you through stuff too uncomfortable to read. The characters are intense and portrayed in a way you either love em or hate em. Well done Tami.. you have a new follower.
5,mysterious...Keeps you guessing!,"I love Tami Hoag...just had to say it...this was the first book that I read of hers and I have to say, I was hooked after this...now I hunt down all her novels...mystery and love...who can ask for more...this book was fantastic...."
3,Seemed like a VERY LONG READ,"I am a Tami Hoag fan and I truly enjoy reading her books. I did however find this particular book to be slightly boring. The idea that this independant women cop ""Megan O'Malley"" would jump into bed with the ""Chief"" after just meeting him is crazy! She seems to hold her beliefs very high and I think that them diminishing in a second would be crazy! The book was ok!"
2,"Half thriller, half romance - and an incomplete ending","It seems that Ms. Hoag learned part of her trade in the Harold Robbins School of Hot Writing. How else to explain the fact that the sex scenes in this book (and there are WAY too many of them) are incredibly overdone?Add points for the thriller and mystery aspect of this book (which Ms. Hoag does extremely well), but deduct points for the ending - which leaves you wondering exactly what happened to Josh - did he just walk away? Was there an accomplice? And what's the diagnosis on him after he comes home?There are just too many unanswered questions at the end of this book, and the romantic scenes are just too unreal. I haven't seen the miniseries based on this book, and now I'm glad I missed it."
1,"540 pages long, 490 pages of garbage","Found the book on an airport bench during a very long flight delay. Last reader would have been kinder to have placed the novel in the garbage. Page after page of stereotypical characters, sexist idiocy, and pointless page filler. I have never read Tami Hoag before so maybe this is not typical of her writing style. I will have to try another of her novels to see if her name is the reason this made it onto any best seller list. It sure didn't happen on the merit of the book. Did the next reader a favor and placed it in the receptacle that the airport provides for this type of trash."
1,Don't even bother,"This book was entirely too predicatble. You could read the first 50 pages and the last 50 pages and not have missed anything but confusing sex and a dragged on plot line. Subtle hints the kidnappers left were supposed to leave you on the edge of your seat, but all they did was make you sick of them because they were repeated over and over to the point where you just skip over it. This book was a big let down froma good author."
2,Just not worth it !,I actually started this book and put it down for a while before picking it up again - BIG MISTAKE. There was a little suspense in there but not enough to get more then two stars from me.First of all all the love scenes with O'Malley and Mitch were just awkward and creepy in light of the kidnapping case. Also Josh just showing up at the end was weird. I just did not buy it.
2,NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL,I FOUND THIS BOOK VERY BORING AND AT TIMES I FOUND MYSELF WANTING TO PUT IT DOWN MORE THAN PICK IT UP. IT WAS VERY DRY READING FOR THE BIG MAJORITY OF THE NOVEL AND I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND READING IT.
3,Reading this felt like dejavu,"I kept getting the impression that I had read this book before! I did, in a way. I read Guilty As Sin a few months ago. Upon checking I discovered that they are close to carbon copies of each other! Good, but too many mushy love scenes for any mystery."
2,Same old formula,"I picked up this book after reading and loving Hoag's Ashes to Ashes and Still Waters. I have not finished it however, because I actually groaned out loud at the ""female heroine who is investigating the crime who gets involved with the man who is bad for her"" theme. It is exactly the same in these 3 books. Maybe I can tolerate finishing it after a few months when I forget how much this book is like the other ones. Other than that problem, I have found her books to be most enjoyable. Let's just come up with some new characters, please!!"
3,Choose a Different Tami Hoag Mystery,"I'm a huge fan of Tami Hoag, but it seems to be hit or miss with her. My first mystery of hers was Ashes to Ashes, which I loved. I am a huge mystery junkie, and it was everything I look for in a suspense novel. I have read every mystery that Mary Higgins Clark has written and have to admit her writing can't even compare to Tami Hoag's. Night Sins definitely falls into the ""miss"" category though -- slow-paced, too long, and very difficult to get into. If this is the only Tami Hoag book you've read, do not give up on her! Prior Bad Acts and Ashes To Ashes are 100x better written and more suspenseful; it's difficult to believe it's even the same author."
2,As much romance as mystery,"I found out after reading this that Hoag was also a romance novelist. I wasn't surprised in the least. The incredibly unrealistic romance between the lead law enforcement officers (!), the cardboard cut-outs of all characters, ruined what was a pretty good mystery.But the final blow was the discovery that the story was continued in Hoag's next novel, _Guilty as Sin_.Save your money, go buy something by Laurie R. King instead."
5,One of the decades best crime susepense novel.,"Hoag draws the reader into an dramatic world of crime and passion. With many twist and angles leaping at the reader from every page. Hoag brings the story through an amazing rollercoaster ride, only to leave you hanging on the edge of your seat for the next installment"
2,A Little Long Winded,"Tami Hoag is very adept at creating atmosphere in her books. This one has many interesting characters. The chemistry between Megan O'Malley and Chief Mitch Holt works well. There are a few too many cutesy cliches. ""...a pair of bushy eyebrows that should have had their own zip code"". This story lags in places and could have benefited from more editing. Still, a fairly enjoyable read."
2,Predictable and insipid,"This isn't a thriller, not a police procedural--more a meshing of Ed McBain and a romance novel. The story is contrived- the ""villian"" is revealed far too late, and with no fleshing out of his character. The notion that Megan would hop in the sack a few days after hitting town is moronic, and the sex scenes read as if they were written by a nun.Don't waste your time."
2,A Moderate Thriller that really costs double what you see on,"This was a passable mystery, not great but a decent beach read, until you get to the lack of an ending. At that point you realize that what you have bought is actually the first half of a sequel and that what was an acceptable ...540 page book isn't worth the time or money at ...1000 pages. I don't think I'm giving away the ending since I never invested the time or money in Guilty as Sin, so I don't know the ending."
1,Night Sins,"This book was irritating. I couldn't believe that a ""professional"" detective would fall into bed with a man (her boss!) she just met. the endind was infinished- a ploy to buy the next book, which I do not plan to purchase. The author does little to promote women's issues."
4,BOOGIE WOOGIE CHRISTMAS CARD REVIEW,"really good cd ..I met the artist ,Jimmy Maddox, on a recent cruise on Holland America Line, the ms noordam. He was the entertainer in the Piano Bar.He has a lot of talent. The Boogie Woogie Christmas Card cd is a good example of his style of entertainment.I really enjoy the cd and it will be a welcome addition to my holiday collection. Hope your customers enjoy it as well.Boogie Woogie Christmas Card"
3,Not much to this one,"I always try to get my kids more the educational toys, but this one really was not worth the money.The experiments are fun for my 5 year old, but most of the ingredients that are easily found in the house, but I bought this kit thinking everything was included.I would rather buy a book of experiments and then spend the same amount on the household ingredients and get more experiments for him to do."
5,Excellent solution,"Works great. Large number of options for actually attaching the speakers to the mounts. Easy to install with the flat panel TV already attached to the wall mount. Note, however, that this unit works only as a part of the Omnimount system."
1,PArents be ware,"This book is intended for a mature high school audience..unfortunately it is being given out to 13 year old 8th graders...too much pot smoking, they have an intimate scene after a trashy dialogue...not a good story at all...parents beware if you are at all in tune with your kids required reading....too much too soon in my educated opinion..."
1,Bad,"When I chose to read this book I expected one about Buddy and his grandfathers past. What I got instead was a stupid book about a hormonal teenage boy who would, it seems, do anything to get with a girl. M.E. Kerr had a good idea but went off on another plot that displayed the worst in the plot, character, and her writing."
2,Gentlehands,"I'm only on the 9th chapter, the book, is kinda boring, but most people say it will get better at the end.This book is about a boy named Buddy who has a rich girlfriend, which Buddy is trying to impress her by buying all these nice clothes. His dad is not really happy with him about to doing this. I know, I would not go by clothes to impress a guy, because then that guy is not worth goign out with.This book teaches people about religion & Jewish people. Also, about life with guys and ladys. I wouldn't say this si a very good book so far, but it is a good book to learn from."
3,An interesting but sort of predictable story...,"It was a summer that Buddy Boyle would remember all his life. Only, one thing that irked me was it was never stated when exactly the book took place! Anyways, Buddy starts dating a rich girl, Skye Pennington, who summers in his hometown on Long Island. In order to impress Skye, he introduces her to his grandfather, who is pretty much not a part of his family's life. He grows to love his grandfather and spend more and more time with him, something his policeman father and mother (whose father is the one Buddy is getting close with) do NOT like. However, a writer that is at Skye's house is also looking for a SS Nazi, who he believes lives on Long Island. Everything comes together, and since you feel you really know Buddy, that makes it all the more heartbreaking. Not a bad read."
4,Excellent First Book on the Rainforest,"The Rain Forest by Gallimard Jeunesse and Rene Mettler is an excellent book to introduce children to the rainforest. I like the technique of turning the plastic page to reveal the animals. Gallimard introduces food chain, camouflage, and deforestation topics in the book. There is one misleading fact in the book. Mature rainforests do not need to be cut with a machete, only the edge of the rainforest is thick.Thomas Sandusky, Creator of Stories from the Rainforest"
3,"A step down, but could be worse","This one doesn't have the same kind of charm as the first two and the fact that the Jim Henson team didn't do the animatronics on this one doesn't bode well for it. It ends up as a mostly watchable outing that suffers from a lack of real gravitas to the story. At least they've moved on from the ""origin story"" structure of the first two movies, allowing the Turtles to simply exist in this world. However the idea of sending them back in time to Asia doesn't serve them as well as they might have hoped."
3,Not as good as the first 2,"I remember watching this movie in the theater when I was 3 or 4. I feel asleep for entirely the whole movie! I didn't like this that much,basically because it has not plot, no foot soldiers, and no shredder! I think the first is the best."
2,THIS MOVIE IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I fell in love with the first two Ninja Turdle movies and I expected to fall in love with the third one as well.Boy was I wrong! What I hate the most about this movie is the animatronics are no where near as good as the first two. There mouths often times move out of sync with their words, and whats the deal with their eyeballs. They look like their about to pop out of their heads, especially Leos. They stupidly went with a company other than Jim Henson Productions.Splinter looks like he's been smokin some of that good stuff!! A lot of the plot elements suck as well.Lets take the scene where Mike rescues Yoshi from the burning house. Wouln't you think they would have bonded after that. Instead he bonded with Ralf. Go figure. The only reason I'd recommend buying this movie is if your a die hard collector. Otherwise, don't bother."
4,Great twist on the series,"OK, so this movie doesn't feature uber-villain Shredder, but this is one great entry into the TMNT series. Though not as good as TMNT: The Movie it is ten times better than TMNT II. The story starts with the Turtles down in their new subway lair (discovered in II) just hanging out now that Shredder is dead and buried. April stops by with an ancient Japanese device she picked up for Splinter at a garage sale. The device turns ""on"" and transports April to feudal Japan, a young Japanese prince taking her place. The Turtles spring into action and travel back in time to save their friend. Of course complications ensue and the Turtles find themselves in the middle of a revolution of sorts between the prince's father and the prince's rebel girlfriend. The great part of the film is that the Turtles must decide if they want to stay in the past, where they are accepted and revered, or return to the present and remain outcasts.And perhaps the best part of the film: No Vanilla Ice!!!"
3,Depends on what you want...,"Whether or not this movie should be considered better or worse than the first two depends greatly on what you want to get out of it. The facts are as follows: 1) it deviates severely from the ""traditional"" plot line (ie. Turtles vs. Shredder). 2) The turtles' characters are (comparatively) more mature and have thus ceased to act like 15 year-olds. 3) The fight scenes are very enjoyable, much more so than in the first movie, because they are well lit and you can really appreciate the artistry of the choreography. Personally, I enjoyed seeing how the characters had matured and developed. Each turtle's personality is much more distinct in this movie. They are individuals now rather than a group of adjective-yelling adolescents. Basically, this movie is different from the first two, so if you aren't willing to try something new, don't see it. But if you liked the turtles for themselves and not just their image, give it a try."
2,Enough is Enough,"This movie plays off of the success of its predecessors, and the plot really starts to suffer with this one. I thought that the first one was great, and the second was so-so, but this is too much. A poorly thought out plot, and some very bad clichés make this movie barely worth a rent"
4,love it!,"OK, I've a turtle fan before i could even say teenage mutantninja turtle, it came out tenage mutin nijit turtles! Well, i am not that old, i am a teen, but i love this movie, this is the only i dont have, and im missing a few of the cartoon tabes. But, this is my fave. of them all. I love the age of the ninja, so i fell in love with it the first time i saw it. And this was the on TMNT movie i saw on the big screen. Well, if i had the choose of the three, this would be it! END"
3,? ? ?,"I bought this movie along with a 10inch size turtle it came together as a package i hope my 2 yr old son likes , i like it too bad im not a kid anymore lol . . ."
1,Worst of the series!,What are the reviewers thinking sayin that it's a good movie? It is not. It's nothing compared to the first two. In this one the turtles go to Japan and try to save April from the cage. At least it's the same cast from the first two but nothing like the original. The first turtle movie seems to make more sense the other two because most of it is in the cartoon series. Don't waste your time watching this it's boring. The first one is better.
5,TMNT III,"I truly enjoyed this film as I am sure any turtle fan would. I have watched the VHS and DVD several times over the years, shoot, I got the DVD for christmas as well as the other two films in the box set I got for christmas a few years ago. Why? cause I wore out the tape due to watching it all the time. If you liked the other two live action turtle films, get this one to complete the collection or find the box set and get all three at once."
4,...,well i saw this movie again over the summer and all i ave to say to itwhat were theguys thinking!? i mean the whole time traeling just doesnt fit into the tmnt universe and for it to be all asain and everything when you have new york turtles just doesnt match!!! the movie is fine for tmnt fans and should be seen by everyone though...i just cant wait for the new cgi tmnt movie and the new tmnt show coming to FOX BOX this feb!www.foxbox.tv for more info on the new tmnt show
5,barn7,I received product when told I would. Product was is the exact shape it said that it would be. I would definitly order from this supplier again.
3,Up to Sequil standards,This movie is like most sequils to movies that we fell in love with... that is if you are a fan of the oh so awsome ninja turttles. The movie is mildly amussing with more ninja fighting and a rap scene with Vanilla Ice... what more could you ask for in a movie???
2,Goodbye Ninja Turtles...,"This movie marked the end of ""Turtle Mania"" and by the time the movie came out, the Ninja Turtles were on their way out. But, I will always like the Ninja Turtles. They were the bomb.The third and final turtle movie isn't as good as the first two, but its worth watching at least once."
2,Pass this one up!,"This time April buys some ancient Japanese antique which turns out to be a time septer and she switches places with a Japanese king's son.So the turtles have to go and get her and return within'a 48 hour period.Not all that interesting,event tamer than part 2.The best thing about this is Casey Jones,and the 4 Japanese guys, who switch places with the turtles,watching hockey and playing video games at the bar."
2,Not as good as the first two,"The turtles are at it again for the third time, but this movie isn't nearly as good as the first two, one of the reasons why is that Splinter's voice was awful, it seems to be that he was shaking and his voice was a little upbeat, also there are no foot soldiers or the Shredder, just a bunch of Japanese villians, and the idea of going back in time wasn't that great either, fortunatly we do get to see Casey Jones back even though he had only a minor role and Corey Feldman returns as the voice of Donatello (he didn't do the second one due to rehab for heroin addiction).Paige Turco returns as April O' Neal.The only reason why I give this movie 2 stars instead of 1 cause it has Casey Jones in it but other than that, it's just not a great movie, only recommended for only the diehard turtle fans."
2,Update. Parts just don't fit.,"None of my shelves fit. Took a right angle to it and every shelf is about 93 degrees. I tried bending the shelf clips and warping the shelf itself.. no luck.Called amazon and they are sending a new one. Love amazon, it's just Hyloft who hasn't impressed me so far.update:Amazon sent me a new one and still the shelves don't fit. I have tried multiple corners and angles.To make it work I had to unscrew the wall panels and then jam the shelves in, then tighten it up. Shelves of warped but I don't want to hassle amazon again."
4,The polish cleans the guitar,"I don't really find a point in the more expensive polish. It cleans the guitar. It makes the fingerprints go bye bye. it works. if you feel the way i do, get a guitar poish regardless of the price or brand."
4,A Great Starting Point,"This book is excellent if you have no experience or knowledge reading ECG's or the terminology. The graphs, points of interest, and self quizzes are fun and keeps your memory fresh. I found myself saying why am I doing this stupid exercise and yet I was able to remember and use the information that I just read in the real world this book is definitely worth picking up."
4,Fits the Triton!,I purchased this for my Triton Wet Sharpener and it fits the shaft perfectly. I use the wheel for honing the inside of my turning gouges and for this it works well. Just remember to apply some light machine oil to the leather before you apply the honing compound. This will give a better final result and help protect the leather wheel.
4,Leather strop,"I wish they provided a second strop for the larger gouges. This one works fine on small gouges.I figured out that if you soak the leather with light weight oil (3 in 1, air tool oil etc.) before applying the grit it works a whole lot better. Buy new grit at the auto parts store. It's a better grit."
1,Cheap!,"I purchased two of them for my courtyard wall. After only a few summer months, the top panel one one of them is tarnished. The bottom mounts on both lights are splitting. I would not recommend buying these lights."
4,Transfer Really Showing It's Age,"For a 2001 release, this was a pretty good effort. In 2010 with 40+ inch HDTVs widely available, it's damn near unwatchable. Image should consider transferring this to blu-ray or re-releasing the DVD with a fresh 16:9 anamorphic transfer with player generated subtitles. This version is a 4:3 transfer, with a hard matte of the 16:9 picture. There are only 288 lines of interlaced video out of an available 480. Scaled up to 1080p it looks awful. The remainder of the space is taken up with borders and burned in subtitles. Back in 2001, this was probably done for superior font clarity and readability. If Image isn't interested in doing the work they should sell the rights to someone who would be willing to undertake a preservation project like Criterion."
5,Inagaki's Chushingura,"Japan loves the story of the loyal 47 ronin, who avenge the wrongful forced-seppuku death of their master. It's been told like a bazillion times before, and illustrated, and there are plays, too! Of films, I count at least 27 different versions.I like Mizoguchi's version in two parts for its aesthetic. But, this Inagaki version is really a lot of Hollywood-style fun. Color, for one thing, makes this easy to like, and a little cameo of Toshiro Mifune doesn't hurt.This was a film meant to be enjoyed. So, enjoy already!"
4,Beautiful but Lengthy,"First off, I really enjoyed this film. Years ago, I'd heard references to its tale and always wanted to see it. Now that I have, I am not disappointed. The tale of the loyal 47 retainers is a classic.However, the film moves very slowly. And justly so. The first hour alone (the film's approx 3.5 hrs long) is just to set up the actual problem. This is a story that takes time to tell. It's complicated and it's deeply rooted in Japanese culture. The viewer needs time to comprehend the situation. If you're looking for an action film, look elsewhere. Even when the 47 go into action, the fights are over quickly.The cast is strong. If you're a fan of Japanese cinema, you'll appreciate some of the recognizable names and faces. Plus, you can't go wrong with Toshiro Mifune. Visually, the film is lovely to look at. The music is quite good, as well.So, I would recommend this film, but only to the right viewer."
4,A touching telling of the 47 Ronin story,"This is an excellent film relating the true story of the 47 vassals of the Asano family who avenged their dead lord. The story is briefly as follows: in 1701, Lord Asano, ruler of a section of western Japan, was grievously insulted by Lord Kira while in the Shogun's castle. Asano attacked Kira with his sword to avenge the insult, wounding Kira slightly. For drawing his sword in the castle, Lord Asano was forced to commit seppuku (suicide with a sword) and his domain was confiscated by the government. His samurai warriors were out of their jobs, and 47 of them, under Chamberlain Oishi, united to avenge their master on Lord Kira. For taking the law into their own hands, they too were forced to commit seppuku. This film is very good, and can only be criticized on the grounds that it moves quite slowly. However, it is a fine film overall; I've watched it several times and still enjoy it."
3,"Inagaki's ""Chushingura""","""Chushingura"" may be Inagaki Hiroshi's best film. It is certainly his most widely known outside Japan. The film is also quite beautiful to see. Yet I cannot help but feel that this often told story needs something more than another straight foward retelling."
1,Technical quality unacceptable,"The technical quality of this DVD is dreadful. Images go out of focus, they lack detail, they show interlacing artefacts, and movement is often jerky. It looks like a bad copy from a VHS."
3,Does not live up to the reviews I've read,"Starting and ending quite interesting, the bulk of this film contains extremely subtle drama that is as exciting as a de Balzac novel. The slow pace alienates the viewer and some of the sub-plots almost seem tacked on. Filmed very well but well short of brilliant. The acting and direction, however, are superb. Toshiro Mifune has a very minor role despite being pictured on the cover."
2,Yucky,"This book wasn't as good as I thought it would be... The kidnapping was so boring! It was like it wasn't even real! I thought it would be more exciting than it was. When I got it, it was in the Young Adult section... it was like reading a 4th grader book!..."
4,From the cover,"From the back of the book:This volume gathers twenty-four of John Keble's (1792-1866) best sermons spanning the liturgical year. Read as historical documents, these select homilies reveal the central preoccupations of his intellectual life, including his high sacramental theology and ecclesiology. But these works are also marked by the acute pastoral sense that made him beloved in his own day, and by his passionate desire that even the simplest of believers understand and embrace the life of Christian holiness. A substantial introductory essay by Maria Poggi Johnson sets his sermons in the context of Victorian religion, outlines the main themes of his thought, and suggests ways in which his homilies are relevant to contemporary Christians and students of religion."
