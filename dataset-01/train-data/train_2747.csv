2,smells great but super oily,"I used a pump and I put it in my hair, brushed it, and let it air dry. my hair was oily and gross."
1,Leaves hair greasy,"I like to try new hair products from time to time, and decided to give Organix Shea Butter Liquid Glass Serum a try. I have shoulder length, medium-thickness hair. I used it twice, and both times it made my hair feel really greasy. The first day, I used one pump's worth and my hair felt really bad all day. The second day I used half as much and got essentially the same results. This was a wasted purchase."
1,typical unauthorized rubbish,"Silly me for not checking the details of this DVD properly before buying. Somehow I was expecting a live in concert DVD.Either way, it gets 1 star. It's crap. Save your money."
5,Interesting,I chose this rating because the author writes in an engaging style and the subject is very interesting. I'd recommend it especially for those interested in mission work.
4,Great look at the struggles of improving public health in a 3rd world country.,"This book was recommended to me by a colleague when I was considering a Master's in Global Public Health. I couldn't put it down. There were many things associated with culture that I hadn't considered or heard of before, such as the locals ascribing potency of medication according to the color of the pill. Dr Farmer did a great job of taking the cutural barriers and using them to affect outcomes in a positive way."
4,Mountains beyond Mountains by Tracy Kidder,"This was required reading for my high school kid. Of the books she read, this was her pick for best. Inspirational, she is hoping to be a doctor eventually herself and the non-income motivation was welcome."
5,Krik? Krak!,"This book was one of the things that inspired me to get busy and do something. Thanks Tracy and Paul! Se what we are doing now thanks to getting inspired by what one person can do...[...]Krik? Krak! program is feeding several hundred children each week! Check it out and maybe you'll want to help us, too!Maggie"
4,The Troubling State of Third World Health Care--and Its Proximity to the Rest of the World,"There are two stories of interest here. First is the humanitarian journey of Dr. Paul Farmer, who has created a sustainable health care model at his clinics in Haiti and has been instrumental in moving that model into other third-world locations. The second story is that of third-world medicine itself--a discussion that most of us in the insurance-strangled medical world of mainstream (first-world?) America would find troubling and surprisingly close to home."
5,Wonderful book: Exceptional Man,Mountains Beyond Mountains is the kind of book which leaves you with a feeling of both hope and wonder for what one commited individual can do. In the world of today we need these stories more than ever before. Tracy Kidder is a talented writer and he did a commendable job with an exceptional subject. I highly recommend the book to everyone.
3,Comments,"A light book. Inspiring (especially for young folk thinking of public health as a career). Perhaps over-done a bit, but maybe that is allowed in book like this.."
2,Mountains Beyond Mountains,"I thought I was reading a book by someone that needs talkers' anonymous. It went on and on and on. I felt it was the same thing being told over a perioed of year. I did enjoy learning about the comparisons between Haiti and Cuba, but that came in the last 100 pages. The author's point of view helped to explain Dr. Farmer and his eccentric personality. Farmer is an exception man."
2,extremely boring,suggest you spend your time with another book. This story is extremely slow to develop and boring in terms of character development.
2,"Good topic, bad portrayal","This is a book about global health but personal perspectives get in the way to see what the reality actual was and looks like. I agree with some of the comments made by previous readers that Tracy Kidder really has a love affair with Paul Farmer. In the book it is overbearing to the point that I felt that it masked his critical thinking. It doesn't help that they (Tracy Kidder and Paul Farmer) look a like, perhaps a little unconscious bias at play there, perhaps racist. That was the main thing that bothered me about this book. If Kidder put a Haitian person on a pedestal or some other ethnic person, I would be less affected by it that's all I'm saying.But other than that, there were some interesting insights into the world of global public health, and for those insights the book is worth reading."
3,"Review for ""Mountains beyond mountains""","I wansn't totally satisfied with this product. I thought it would look better without much worn-out marks. Well, it wasn't too bad. It wasn't like it had any missing pages or ripped covers. So I give it rating for so-so."
3,Mountains beyond Mountains,"Interesting book, learned many things about strife in Haiti, medical woes and one persons fight against TB. Book was a bit repetitious, could have been shorter and still gotten the meaning/message across."
4,Mountains Beyond Mountains,Great overview of what has been going on in Haiti through the years and to see what has been done with the treatment of infectious diseases in areas like this. Farmer's compassion for his work is admirable.
5,Mountains beyond Mountains,"Wow! Talk about an amazing human being. I felt so unaccomplished, and yet very inspired."
4,amazing read (but kinda long),"Wow, what a read. Neat to think of Paul Farmer as a contemporary -- not some saint who lived in the days of yore. Although I enjoyed it, I thought it was a little long and speed read some of the sections, but overall this is an inspiring, compelling book."
4,Way beyond,"I've have about 80 pages to go but I'm thoroughly enjoying this tale. Dr. Farmer is a most unusual man, so compassionate, so effective and so interesting in his habits and insights. Kidder has structured the story beautifully. As a kid I read Albert Switzer's autobiography and Farmer is his modern equivalent. Mountains Beyond Mountains is so compelling, so moving I think it cries out for a movie version, which one would hope Hollywood couldn't ruin. Expect to captivated, enthralled and more than a little angry as you read MBM."
5,Amazing Book,"I love this book, its one of my favorites.Tracy Kidder writes clearly and nicely.Paul Farmer is a legend and a hero. One of my top role models. I highly recommend this book because you need to know how great Paul Farmer is and as well as his organization Partners in Health."
3,It's OK,Depressing. Also made me feel guilty and resolved to get more involved in relief programs for poverty-stricken countries. We have so much and others so little.
5,Paul Farmer represents what every doctor should strive for,"I've read books and articles written by Paul Farmer, and Tracy Kidder's book just reinforced my opinion of Farmer--he should be held up as an example for all current and future physicians of true compassion and dedication. This book shows that being a good doctor is not just about diagnosis and treatment of a disease--it's also about truly caring for your patients and meeting all of their needs. Farmer discusses how U.S. policies in Haiti, which were intended to improve conditions, actually made life worse, especially for rural Haitians. Farmer's vast knowledge of science, medicine, policy, and anthropology make him a shining example of the perfect doctor. This book should be a requirement for all medical students to remind them about what being a physician is all about. Wonderful book!"
1,..,"It looks okay, except unevenly-cut edges. They might send a defect one. Not very pleasant to receive the book like this."
4,Justice,"Great book, second time reading it. It is a must read if you care about justice and want to see what others have done to come against it."
5,Living Saint!,I love Tracy Kidder's books and this is one of the most uplifting and ispirational on my all-time favorite list!
2,not what i expected,almost gave up on it. i can read just about anything and enjoy it. this book fell short for me. d.estep ohio
2,Mountains Beyond Mountains,Book is very well written but still ends up plodding. I gave up after 150 pages.
2,disappointed...,I was disappointed when receiving this book. It was filled with ink written remarks and lines all through the book. It is very distracting when reading the book and should have been noted when selling.
5,Fantastic Book!,"This is one of the most inspiring books that I have read in over 20 years. The author is a master at getting you into the shoes of the central character: Paul Farmer.I highly recommend that you be prepared to be ""hooked"" on becoming a volunteer for Partners in Health."
5,AMAZINGGG...,"If you want to do anything in the medical missions field, this book shows you the passion and compassion of a man who did in right in Haiti. Definitely worth the money/ time it takes to read this amazing book."
3,Mountains Beyond Mountains vs. Three Cups of Tea,"As a medical anthropologist and epidemiologist I am familiar with what Dr. Farmer has accomplished. As an alumnus of the University of Washington, I am aware that the UW encouraged all incoming students last year to read Mountains Beyond Mountains and that both Dr. Farmer and the author have been guests on the campus. Unfortunately, I read Mountains Beyond Mountains after having read Three Cups of Tea, a true ""must-read,"" that chronicles the activities and passion of Greg Mortenson for developing schools in Pakistan and other areas of Central Asia. While it may be unfair to compare the two, their similarities in terms of describing what one person can do to make a difference are striking. Read Mountains Beyond Mountains first and then read Three Cups of Tea and think about what you as an individual can do to make the world a better place for all."
4,Mountains Beyond Mountains an Unexpected Surprise,My son needed to read this for college. He thought the book was thought provoking and he liked it.
5,A quick read,"Picked this book up from a table of required reading for incoming students in another state. I was in need of something to read while riding to and from soccer fields and between games during my child's weekend tournament. Holy cow! My 'quick read' has become one that I am constantly recommending to people. I was so impressed with Dr. Farmer that I impressed my own high schooler to present him as a 'humanitarian mentor' for an English class speech. To say that I loved this book would be an understatement. I applaud Dr. Farmer's dedication to the poor of Haiti. I applaud his constant search for a means to serve them and make all of our lives bettter with the search for an easier procrument of needed drugs. I applaud Kidder for bringing this fight to life within pages of this book. It's an easy, delightful and yet difficult read. Why is something so simple as helping sick people made so very difficult by those in charge?"
5,Inspiring Account,"Paul Farmer's life is an inspiring story of dedication to those suffering around the world. This story follows his medical work in Haiti and other developing countries as he confronts ineffective World Health Organization policy on the eradication of TB and works to develop interventions to solve the hardest cases of TB. Excellent, easy to read story that is very inspiring."
5,"Great book, remarkable man",This book was chosen by SANTA BARBARA READS as the book the community would read this year. It was an excellent and inspired choice. Paul Farmer spoke to the community at a free lecture in October and he was even better than his press. Great sense of humor. Over 300 people turned out to hear him.
4,Beautiful Vacation Homes,"My addition of this book is in french(which I can not translate) and I still love it! I can't wait to order it in english! The homes are absolutely wonderful, and I'm sure the text is fantastic."
3,"Good, but not FANTASTIC","It was a good read and I finished it the same day that I checked it out of the library. It was told from a unique point of view, that's for sure."
5,This novel was simply extraordinarily exhilarating.,"I enjoyed this novel so much I couldn't put it down. ""The View From Here"" was a breath of fresh air that I have never experienced reading before. I am definitely looking forward to reading Brian Keith Jackson's next masterpiece."
5,Masterpiece on paper!,"I thouroughly enjoyed reading this book. I have never read a book from the point of view of an unborn child. However, I was not disapointed. This author is an excellent writer. Words cannot express his writing style. If you have never read anything by this author, you are in for a journey of the mind. Keep up the good work."
5,Awesome Hoodie,My son is thrilled with his Coheed & Cambria hoodie. It is great quality and a great price. Arrived quickly!
5,"A good ending for the season, all set for season 3","This disc had all the charm and humor that you've come to expect from AMG. I seriously laughed out loud more than once, which is very rare for a romantic comedy. I won't spoil anything, but I will say that the final episode of this season ended in a good way and there's still plenty of material from the manga that could easily be turned into a third season. I know I can't wait for it."
3,And the show comes to an end.. or does it....?,"Sadly, the show being release by ADV here, didn't get the rights to the actual last TWO episodes that would've capped it all off properly with the Lind arc before losing the rights completely and thereby losing the ability to continue it."
5,A great basic guide to the development of the martial arts in Japan.,"This book is the second in a three book series by the late Donn F. Draeger. This volume continues its exploration into the development of the Japanese martial arts from a Jujitsu(Art)to using the term ""DO"" (meaning way).This text covers the historical setting, the rational of developing combat systems, the methods used, and the formation of the Budo systems. Where the Jujitsu systems were designed strictly for practical military use, the Do (Judo, Kendo, Nagainata Do etc)systems emphasized character development. Sport systems also were developed from many of these original military combat systems. For example, Jujitsu, which focused on practical street and military combat, decreased in popularity by Judo, which is a sport.In conclusion, if you are serious about the martial arts you will want to own the entire three book series by Draeger.Rating: 5 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Tanto-Jutsu Official Manual of Bushi Satori Ryu)."
2,A little hard to follow,"I can't say I hated this book, because that would be untrue. But what I can say is that I found her type of writing a bit hard to follow and I found the story to drag in a lot of parts."
2,What a waste of money!,"This self-obsessed teenager is really one of the reasons women are still treated the way they are and the ""Lolita"" image is still succesful (but at least the Nabokov book is a literature classic and was written more than 40 years ago!).The atmosphere is claustrophobic, heavy, there are absurdities in the story (the family of the girl NEVER goes looking for her or calls the police just because they found obscene drawings she did? Please!!!!) and the transformation of the timid teacher to depraved, sadistic vampire is really not convincing and appears totally contrived. I was thinking of something else when I bought the book. The writing is decent, and this is why the book gets 2 stars from me."
3,Unique,"This book is not one of my favorites. The prose, while very descriptive, is often too flowery, and I feel that draws away from the plot. However...the plotline in this book is great. The book is dark, and unlike most young authors, Coote does not adhere to or fall back on tired cliches and stereotypes. I wanted to read more of this book, if only to see what could possibly come next. I find that to be a good quality. I look forward to seeing more from this author in the future."
1,Really pretty bad.,"This was a book I wanted to like--the subject matter seemed interesting, and the reviews I read had high praise. I'm not sure what book the reviewers read. What we have here is an artless, plotless, and frankly unbelievable account of an affair between a young student and her teacher. She moves in with him, seemingly unnoticed by her aunt and uncle (her guardians) or social services. The teacher is a muddy cliche of the ""Sensitive Guy,"" whose motivations are never explored and who comes across as a complete schmo. Our nameless narrator simply doesn't have enough personality to keep her interesting, and you have to wonder what draws these two together. Nor is the book terribly well written--purple prose and clunky dialogue are piled on for 200-odd pages. This reads like a juvenile girl fantasy. Best save your money."
3,A pretty boring picture,"Eric a Postman, sons fathered with women of various ethnicities, struggles to cope with a reality of a single dad and granddad while protecting his grown son from youngster's shadow economics associates by deploying delusive command of then French-British football star Eric Cantona.A pretty boring picture of a grey pitiful UK reality embedded during longer screenings ofShamelessandLittle Britainalready."
4,Unforgettable,"This is one of the most mind-wrenching books of the 20th century, and if you read it, you will understand this is not hyperbole. A simple Jack London-esque story of a man and his dog, and the vast love and respect they share through their many adventures. You know the stuff: patrolling the perimeters of political prisons. Chasing down concentration-camp escapees. Tracking the innocent through frozen wastelands as they desperately flee their persecutors.I mean, how can you not love a dog?"
2,By thoughts..,"I bought this book to host trivia nights with friends.There are many sections with multiple choice answers which I found very helpful.Unfortunately I found that many of the questions are geared towards Americans, American sports questions, American geography and American general knowledge and not so much general knowledge worldwide.Overall, I am a little disappointed with the book."
4,"many changes, but the theme remains the same...","as a fan of the original manga, I was pleasantly surprised by the transition to anime; they've vastly increased the cast, and changed some of the emphasis in the plot to draw from additional themes like Japanese office ettiquette, behind the scenes corporate maneouverings and the messy state of geopolitics. Some elements seem to be there just to pad things out, others are actually quite interesting takes on the original plots. The Planetes take on life as an orbital garbage collector is as keen as ever, with a deft touch on the hard sci-fi angle (their discussions appear plausible without bombing the viewer with the underlying maths). there are worse ways to spend your time:)"
5,Trully excellent,This is one of those gushing reviews that can be so annoying. This is the best anime I have ever seen. No questions about it. Go and watch it.
3,Disappointed,The concept of the story was good. After watching some of the episodes I was disappointed. It is really geared to adolescents than adults. The characters spend a lot of time arguing with each other. Just like kids would. I would hate to think people working in space acted so childish. Anyway it may appeal to some but not me. Artwork is ok. Not excellent though.Steve
1,Boring,"I love Anime but I must admit this one is very boring. Planetes is a nice story about space garbage collectors nothing else.The reason I purchase this set was that I thought a change from the usual serious space combat do or die Anime would be nice. Yet this series is nothing but lackluster poor comedy relief in a sci-fi setting. I was hoping for a good comedy and a good plot (in a sci-fi setting of course).I was halfway through the series before I decided to just turn it off, package it for the holidays and send it to some relative or friend for Yule. I hope they do not hate me."
5,Hard science masterpiece,"If Firefly can be considered a moderately hard science sci-fi, then this must be diamond edged. You won't find warp engines, gravity generators (other than spinning cabins), ships that hop from planet to planet without need for refueling, ships that handle like F-16s and roar as they fly by through the vaccuum of space, or any other of a host of problems typical to most sci-fi.No, in Planetes you'll find newtonian physics, chemical fuels that actually run out, the effects of radiation and microgravity on the human body, and a host of other real world concerns.Besides that aspect, the plot, characters, and animation are all fantastic."
5,What a compilation - wonderful,"I have been a Shadows fan since 1964 and have numerous LP's and later compilation CD's. However, some of these early singles I had never heard. Listening to all the songs in sequence clearly shows their musical development. The remastering has definitely improved the quality compared to my old records. A wonderful addition to my collection."
1,Problem playing this CD on DVD Region 1 player,Beware! If you play your audio CDs on a DVD Region 1 player this disc may not play. The copy protection scheme employed causes the audio to be muted on region 1 players.
1,Don't waste your money,This is so ridiculous I shut it off after a few moments - I still have not watched it all the way through!
1,bad movie more like bad theater,bad movie more like bad theater... it was like a bad play that was taped and put on film could not stand to watch
4,Arms and the Man review,"The characterizations and direction were all excellent; maybe Bluntschli seemed a little young and 'smooth'. The voices were easily understandable, in contrast to many new TV dramas where the speech is so fast that older people like us (79) simply can't follow! We guess there aren't many versions of this to choose from, but we'd certainly recommend it -- it's one of Shaw's favorite plays for us. F.J.H. and I.R.H."
3,Dated and rather boring,"I am an unabashed Anglophile and have read this play several times and loved it, so I was excited to see the DVD. But I expected something more modern, more realistic, less hokey. Maybe I tried to watch it too late at night, as I kept falling asleep. I prefer the characters in my imagination to the actors on this DVD."
5,Shaman King - Shaman Fight of Vocal Part II,"The product contains one CD and one DVD- CDThe CD contains five songs, two of them with vocal and two with no vocal of the same songs and one bonus song. One is preformed from Ryuu's voice of the Shaman King animathin and one from HoroHoro. The songs are not related with the music from the animation.- DVDThis DVD is Region 2. The DVD contains three videos. Two are videos of the two songs from the Audio CD and one is the first part of the special episode known as ""Onigiri"" of the Shaman King Animation.Must have for Shaman King Fans."
1,Technical travesty,"The technical quality of this movie is appalling. Technical quality? There was none. The sound was indistinct and sccratch at the best of times. When characters moved upstage, the sound was either distorted or disappeared altogether. This should NEVER have been put on DVD. Please don't waste your money on this shoddy product."
5,got us covered!,"I purchased this umbrella so that we could walk our dogs in the wind and rain without getting wet. It REALLY does a good job. It is the largest umbrella I have ever seen and a good cause is connected to it. It is gray, so goes with every color. I would certainly recommend this product."
4,Keeps your ankles dry!,"This umbrella is stylish and I have received many compliments on it. It has proven to be strong in the wind, which is exactly what I was hoping for. It is very long though so it's not always comfortable to carry around when closed (can double as a cane if you need it). However, you'll be the envy when you arrive to your destination totally dry (the roundness even prevents rain from hitting the bottom of your pants)."
1,So SAD,I read a million reviews before purchasing this umbrella. The first time it rained I was excited to use it. I wasn't even off my block when the stem part of the umbrella snapped in half. Maybe people are reviewing based on how it looks. It LOOKS really good and SEEMS very sturdy. Don't waste your money.I was also charged $5 upon returning this product.
4,Does the job.,"I work at a law firm so keeping my suit/pants dry is important. This has done the job well so far. It opens easily and feels well constructed. Most importantly, it keeps you completely dry except for maybe some of your shoes."
5,Best umbrella I have ever bought !,"The day after my umbrella arrived in its sturdy box, it was raining VERY hard and the wind gusts were fierce.This umbrella held up very well against the wind gusts and kept 2 people dry.I look forward to buying another soon."
5,Songs that sing to the soul,"A sort of cult-following, it seems, has developed around the late Rabbi Shlomo Carlbach z'tzl: a small group of ''Carlbachian'' followers admire his pacificist teachings, and he has acquired great popularity in the mainstream as well, most likely for the sheer soulfulness and elegance of his music. Both in life and death, the good Rabbi is enormously influential, and a Carlbach fever continues to sweep the Jewish community, in certain cases penetrating to the outside world as well. Listening to the songs on this album, one of Rabbi Carlbach's earliest and arguably best recordings, it is not difficult to see why. Regardless of whether or not one follows or is aware of Carlbach's pseudo-mystical teachings, these ''niggunim'' are among the most beautiful, touching, and compelling songs in contemporary Jewish music."
4,Very good first novel,I just finished this book and really enjoyed it. Kept me guessing until the end. I had no idea who had done it. Looking forward to reading his other two nevels.
3,disappointing,"From the other Amazon reviews I expected a better novel. This one toys with the reader. The story is a series of well-written vignettes, but the package as a whole doesn't make sense. I think the author wrote it to make various points, but failed to write a coherent, believable story."
3,Mission fell flat,Looking for new authors to read I found William Landay's Defending Jacob. I enjoyed this story and tried another-Mission Flats. It was a good story but without much excitement.
2,started good and went downhill fast,i read the sample and was interested and then could not get through more than 30 percent of the book. made no sense and was boring
3,Easy read,"I hate to grade an author against his best but I would skip this one and go straight to Defending Jacob. Mission Flats is Landay's first work. By Defending Jacob, he has greatly improved how the surprises - thriller twists and turns - play out. Defending Jacob also provides characters of much greater depth."
3,Read Defending Jacob instead,The main character is not very likable and it takes a while for the story to really grab you. I found myself bored until about mid way through. Defending Jacob is MUCH better
4,Another great read from Landay,"I read this after I read Defending Jacob. It's a very good read, similar in style to his third book. He's an underrated author!"
3,War On Drugs,Nothing remarkable about this book. Remarkable books I read again. Typical gang members doing typical things. Nothing new here. There was an element of suprise which I liked. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
4,Christmas Gift,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter ( she requested it). I have no personal info on it. I'm confident that she likes it.
4,Roller Coaster,"This book is like a blindfolded roller coaster ride - starts off slow and steady then sends you through twists and turns, with no idea just how the ride will end. I picked this book up because I enjoyed the author's latest book - ""Defending Jacob"". Initially, I wasn't as impressed but then I was hooked and in for the ride. Very enjoyable read - couldn't put it down during the last 100+ pages."
3,Nanadottie,"Much of the story has not really been retained in memory, so I don't think that it really had much of an impact on me. The author did a good job describing the urban area, and the problems it was fraught with. It was not a book I found impossible to put down, but it was entertaining enough to finish."
1,Text to Speech NOT ENABLED,"Can you believe it? After enjoying Defending Jacob I purchased Mission Flats. Cannot believe in this day and age that the Author or Publisher would sell an ebook on Amazon without enabling the ""text to speech"" feature. Very disappointed!"
3,Entertaining But Not Great,Just slightly more than worth reading. I considered it entertaining but rather predictable in most respects. It was well written and easy to read.
2,"Can't touch ""Defending Jacob""","disappointed ! bought this after reading, and loving ""Jacob"".Boring cop/ lawyer story.So many names, and characters, and conversations.I lost interest,but plugged along..good ending, but it takes too long to get there"
4,None,This is a very good 1st book. i enjoy the last part of his books when he throws in a real wake up call.
4,Great ending,"I have now read 2 of Landay's books (Defending Jacob and Mission Flats). In each of them, the characters were believable and the endings were not what I had expected. I had a hard time putting each of the books down. I have always been a John Grisham fan and was looking for something a little different. I found it with these 2 books. I can't wait to read Landay's other book."
4,Bill Landay Strikes Again!,"The second of his books that I have read and truly enjoyed. If you love a mystery, this is a good one full of a few unanswere questions right up ot the last page. Truly a good read."
3,Disappointed,"My mistake was that I read this book after reading Defending Jacob, William Landay's most recent novel, and expected the same level of writing. It fell short by far. The story was convoluted and the characters were not well developed. There was the same shock element with unexpected turns in the story, but it just didn't do it for me."
4,a good debut,"William Landy sets the template here for a format that he perfects in Defending Jacob: a mystery the narrator is involved in, some crucial information withheld by same narrator, and insider's look into a murder investigation. A good read."
4,Is It Right to Trick the Reader,"I read the Strangler first and later saw Mission Flats on the shelf in the library so I picked it up. It was a great read. I enjoyed the characters and the feeling of Boston and Maine. As in the Strangler Landay has the ability to make you experience the locales. The characters like Officer Kelly and his daughter were wonderful. I loved the description of swinging the night stick.I would give the book five stars, but then I read some of the other reviews on Amazon. The ending is a problem. Without giving anything away we only learn at the end that the narrator Ben Truman knows more than he had told us. It is unfair to the reader to withhold the information. I am not sure if that is right so I lowered my rating by a star, although I doubt anyone will really take my rating too seriously.I await Mr. Landay's next effort. He is a star writer"
4,There is power here,"Although two infamous Boston search warrant cases fuel the plot(as also ""The Cinderella Affidavit""), it is the family scenes that carry real power. The ending is a not-unexpected twist, and the author may have tried too many plot elements, but he shows real potential and his next work is anxiously awaited."
2,Wish I had borrowed this book...,"....that way I could have saved myself the expense. Truly enjoyed Defending Jacob so I bought William Landay's other books: Mission Flats and The Strangler. Both books peaked my interest in the first 100 or so pages. Then, I got lost in the plots and characters; too many acronyms; complex twists and turns. Still haven't returned to finish either."
2,Disappointed,"I enjoyed reading Defending Jacob so much I wanted to read another book by this author right away.I had to force myself to finish this book. Half way through it I did care about the victim, the police chief, detective, or the murderer.I just waned it to end and I did not care if they found the DA 's murderer or not. .I was very disappointed in the story.. The characters were weak and description very poor. I read the reviews before purchasing the book which I always do. I wassurprised at the good reviews this novel recieved."
3,A sales pitch for the authors product!,"The book is actually quite good and Kernel Regression might very well be a good modelling technique. What destroys much of the credibility is that the author is actually the founder of a company that produces KR software. This fact isn't mentioned ANYWHERE in the book. The author just HAPPENS to use a specific software in all his examples. Guess what software? You have to go to the company website to find the connection.If we set that aside, the book is well written and interesting. Not for the math impaired, though. University level math and statistics needed to be enjoyed in full."
4,Not for the faint hearted,"On page XIV Wohlberg states ""This book is geared to 3 types of readers. The first group includes those who are interested in modeling in general and desire an overview of the KR technique. The second group includes those involved in the development and/or usage of KR software. The third group includes readers primarily interested in the development of computerized trading systems""I fell into the first group. I had three problems with the book:1. Most of the book was relevant to people in group 2 or 3 above;2. The author did not always use plain simple english;3. prerequisite knowledge of Schwagers book ""A Complete Guide to the Futures Market"" and computing and/or statistics was necessary.Nevertheless I found some useful information which I have implemented."
4,Slumberjack!,What a great value for the price. These sleeping bags are just so cute and cuddly. Every kid should have one!
3,Good fourth album,"This starts to show a bit more funk and jazz rock than their previous 3 albums (which were more prog and classic music influenced). But there are still some very great passages on this one. This would be their really last good one (and for a change, the bonus live tracks are some of the best in this disc). Maneige (a sextet) set themselves apart from the rest in their great use of various percussion and the distinctive fusion of classical and french prog. Very nice sounding remastered issue of this 78 lp."
1,Disappointed,"This book looked interesting, so I took a look inside at what it had to say about my favorite book, Ghosts of the Titanic. The bibliography and summary of Ghosts was entirely false and it is evident facts were not checked when it was written. The ""reviewer"" mentioned in the summary who apparently hoped Pellgrino's book would hit an iceberg was in fact sour after getting knocked off an expedition which was in favor of Charlie instead, and Pellegrino's relations with Ballard as well as his access to Walter Lord's wealth of information has been confirmed, even by the Titanic Historical Society.If this one statement can be proven false, I shudder to think what else lies in this book that may also suffer at the hands of such easily disputable information."
5,Johnnie Be Bad SO Good!,"If I was a piano I would not want anyone but Johnnie Johnson to play me. Beautiful, vital music. The melodies are magical, and Johnnie's left hand just fills up the songs. I love Rich McDonough's guitar playing! I love the whole band, and love the vocalists. The dynamics are incredible. You do not hear`this kind of dynamics in recordings enough anymore! The Blues Don't Knock is one of the most powerful songs I have ever heard! And Beach Weather is just a happy good time catchy stick in your brain not go away song. Johnnie was a special man. This is special music."
5,Johnnie Be 80 and Still Bad!,"Johnnie Johnson's rolicking boogie woogie blues piano on tracks 1,2,4, and 6 make my blue days sunny! I can't feel down when his gifted fingers dance over the keyboard painting a happy sound! Track 3's ""The Blues Don't Knock"" is a true blues lovers delight with Johnnie painting the mournful sound with his piano talents, Rich McDonough's guitar crying from the innermost depths and LarryThurston's always great vocalization interpreting Jeff Alexander's intuitive lyrics. Thurston's smooth, rich sound is on all tracks except 5. Victor ""Big Daddy"" Johnson supplies the perfect vocal interpretation of a woman tortured man on ""Better Sell My House."" This CD of Johnnie Johnson at his best and still bad is a work of art. Thanks to Jeff Alexander for making it happen so the rest of us blues lovers can enjoy ""Johnnie Be Eighty and Still Bad! Mary C., KZUM, Lincoln, NE"
2,Not as expected.,"I was disappointed in this CD. I was expecting the real versions of the songs, not cover band versions. I graduated in 1985 and I don't even recognize many of the songs. Now that I read back on other reviews, I wished I had reviewed them before I purchased."
2,Not what I expected,"These are not the original hits I hear on the radio or the danceclub. They are pretty much covers by faceless session vocalists. The music quality is not good either. Boys, there are much better compilations release by Megahit Records such as the ""Gay Happening"" & ""Divas of Dance"" series. Try those instead boys!"
3,"OK, but not what I was expecting","I'm not sure what it was, but I just never quite got into this book. While well written, it just didn't appeal to me. If you are looking for a fun, quick and entertaining novel, I can't recommend this one."
5,"LOVE IT, BUT......","I LOVE THE PRODUCT AND HAVE SUCH A HARD TIME FINDING IT IN STORES, APPARENTLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE STOPPED MAKING IT. I WAS SO HAPPY TO FIND THE PRODUCT ON LINE, SO I PURCHASED 3 BOTTLES. I USED IT THE 1ST TIME AND NOTICED AN ODOR, DIDN'T THINK TOO MUCH SINCE I HAD NOT USED IT FOR A FEW MONTHS, BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIND IT, ANYWAY I CONTINUED TO USE THE PRODUCT DAILY, FINALLY I DECIDED TO LOOK AT THE EXPIRATION DATE, MIND YOU, WE ARE IN JUNE OF 2010 AND SAW THAT THE PRODUCT HAD EXPIRED IN AUGUST 2006. EWWW! I REALLY DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD DO ANY HARM TO ME, BUT EWWW! NOT SO HAPPY ANYMORE."
3,Tired and drawn out,"I really enjoyed Lahiri's collection of short stories and was looking forward to her novel. However, I was very disappointed in her story telling and drawn out descriptions of particular characters. I was particularly annoyed with Gogol's pointless relationships, and therefore the pointless and excrutiating details Lahiri describes about them, ie, what these women ate, bought, wore, etc... Instead of creating clear images of the characters, her technique becomes droll and painful to read. Why does it matter to the central plot or theme?I was particularly excited at the prospect of teaching this novel in my Immigrant Literature class as I have used Interpreter, but the themes of family, culture and immigrant experience in The Namesake felt poorly developed.One thing that really bothered me was the repetative style Lahiri employs when she uses a comma instead of an ""and"", this really bugged me.If you want to read anything of Lahiri, stick to her short stories and avoid this one."
2,Can it stand the test of time ?,"I think not. I got a sense that this book is written more as a travelogue than a real work of art. Some detail of indian way of life is mentioned, obviously not for indians, but to woo the western audience. These are observations more befitting a travelogue.The prose is effortless to read, and the novel is a page tuner. But, again I don't think it is of a high cailbre. Let me explain, real art is mostly imaginative, it spell bounds the reader with its imaginative flair. Here, you are left with a feeling that the author is basically rehashing her experiences and the characters she knows in real life into to hotch potch interesting ancedotes. It might be the best work ever to come from the author now or in the future, the work has certain clarity and beauty, but brilliant it is not."
5,Well written and engaging,I am a big fan of novels involving immigration and cross-cultural struggles. This book captures the essence of the struggle for one young man with poignant and compelling writing from start to finish. I have given away both copies of this book to family members who have also thoroughly enjoyed the book. I now need to buy a copy to keep!
3,Nice Story,"There is a good story here, but I felt like I was reading pulp fiction instead of the work of a Pulitzer Prize winniing author. The writing seemed cold and did not engage me. There were some good themes running through the novel - the power of a name, the importance of heritage - but, for the most part, they got lost in the soap opera of Gogol's life. As many others already commented, this would have been better as a short story, focusing more on the real themes."
3,Ordinary.,"This is a tale of two generations of an (Asian) Indian family. The first part of the book, focusing on the parents, is primarily a social novel. The second part, focusing on the son, but the mother also to some extent, is more a novel of character. I learned something from the first part, and enjoyed the second part, but overall I would have to say this book was quite ordinary, as contrasted to Lahiri's earlier effort, Interpreter of Maladies. The son, although liberated culturally, is rather a repressed personality, and Jumpa manages to make him interesting primarily through his sequence of lovers. The Namesake was the second novel I have read this year in which a young man moves in with his lover AND her well to do parents, and they become something of a foursome (no, not sexually; the other novel was Russian Debutante's Daughter)."
4,loved it enough to share it,"I thought the book was vivid and well written. From an American point of view, she depicted growing up another culture in America, not to the full extent of it's harsher reality, but some of the emotions of a first generation were defenitely present."
2,*snore*,"I generally enjoy reading stories about other cultures (I usually choose non-fiction), particularly ones with middle-eastern and indian settings. This book looked like it would be interesting; Indian foreigners trying to establish themselves the USA.I found the beginning captivating enough, where the author details the arranged marriage, move to the USA and the birth of the main character. Once the main character grows up however, I lost interest entirely - I cant put my finger on what happens but the momentum of the story comes to a grinding hault. And unfortunately so did my reading. I kept going for a bit, hoping it would improve, but this was not the case.Unfortunately I cant recommend this read."
3,Life is just details,"Like every book, getting through the first chapter of this one was quite the task -- one must really, truly, try to get through it; in the beginning pages, it just seems like nothing is happening... sure the author's words are being read but it's just huge blocks of text describing every, little, minute detail and that can be a hassle. However, after getting over the hump you realize that this writing style is essential to the thematic statements this book makes and how it notes that this is life: just a lot of details and nothing more. Great book full of just life moments, chronicling the life of an Indian boy struggling between two cultures and how he deals with it into manhood."
3,Take it or Leave it,"Had to read this for class, but was not terrible impressed. It was interesting to see customs from other cultures, but besides that it was a little boring. I didn't connect with the characters and it didn't leave a lasting impression."
4,"Jhumpa Lahiri's tale of the likeable, interesting Ganguli family","Jhumpa Lahiri does wonderful work here fleshing out the details of this fictional transplanted Bengali family. I saw Mira Nair's film adaptation first. I found it so compelling that I felt a need to read the novel as well to see how the two compared. The Gangulis are likeable, interesting characters, so spending time with them twice was a treat.Except for minor details, the essence of Ms. Lahiri's tale is told on film. What struck me is how Nair captured and highlighted the emotional high points of the book. I ended up liking the movie more, but surely credit is due to Jhumpa Lahiri for her creation of the tale and its extraordinarily rich detail."
4,New outlook,"This book wasn't written extravagantly, yet it had such depth. It wasn't a cliff-hanger, but I still couldn't put it down."
4,Good,"A nice sophomore effort from Lahiri. She fashioned a well thought out, engaging yarn this time. Gogol Ganguli's family certainly has some similar qualities to my own (being a second-generation Indian myself). As mentioned in previous reviews, I felt that the lack of other cultures in the story, combined with some overtly stereotypical behavior from Gogol's family, hindered a full enjoyment of the book. Still, it was certainly well written and, at points, moving."
4,What's in a Name?,"How does a writer follow up a Pulitzer Prize-winning debut? Jhumpa Lahiri, who at the age of 32 was awarded the coveted literary prize for her masterful story collection, Interpreter of Maladies, once again marvels readers with smooth and elegant prose in her novel, The Namesake. Lahiri clearly illustrates what it is to live an entire life in America, but still feel a bit out of place at times. Her stunning images of the elaborate feasts, the traditional clothing, and the ceremonial rites of the Indian culture make The Namesake a very rewarding and worthwhile reading experience."
4,Terrific Novel,"I just finished The Namesake and found it to be a wonderful novel. I was somewhat surprised to find negative comments among these reviews that criticized it for being depressing or long-winded. It struck me as a very honest book with real characters facing realistic problems. Life does not always work out as we plan, and I appreciated the author's courage in avoiding easy happy endings. Her writing was clean and elegant, her characters complex, and her description of a culture that is different than mine was most interesting. I would strongly recommend this book to others."
3,From an Indian American,"I have to say I was disappointed with this book. Though Lahiri's style is an elegant one, I found myself angered with her portrayal of young Indian Americans. Her characters reject the culture long after the 'high school rejection' years. Not many Indian Americans are that way. Though it's fiction, she portrayed first generation Indians as selfish instead of, how many of us are, embracing families yet still being independant. We have found a better way to live with the cross cultures and not so cruelly reject our heritage and families."
3,Unfortunately or fortunately...,"Unfortunately or fortunately for Ms. Lahiri, her debut ""Interpreter of Maladies"" has set a very high standard & high expectations from the readers. ""The Namesake"" is a quiet story about a South Asian immigrant family from Calcutta. This narrative is reflective & observant. The author's exploratory style captures feelings & social insight. However it fails to highlight the subtleties which made her first novel unique. If you could read this novel without expectations, it will prove to be a pleasant read."
2,Not Much Happens,"I found this story really disappointing. It just never delivers -- in terms of plot, characters or action. I kept waiting to be engaged or moved, and it never happened."
3,"Simple, beautiful, but not very memorable...","I enjoyed this book and was able to empathize with the main character very well. I've lived my entire life with a name I've hated and understood exactly what he was going through. While my name doesn't really have anything to do with being caught between cultures, I do understand what is like to kind of cringe when asked your name and to live with at least mild resentment about it.The characters in this novel were not as fully developed as they could have been, but I did care about them, and did find beauty in their story. This book is not something that will change your life, or even stay with you for any length of time after reading it. But, this being said, it is worth reading."
2,Below par,"I enjoyed Lahiri's first book, INTERPRETER OF MALADIES, especially the first, last and title stories. I ordered THE NAMESAKE from Amazon.com even before the pub date, because I couldn't wait. So of course my expectations were sky-high for her newest book, but nevertheless, they didn't have to be dashed quite so cruelly. THE NAMESAKE is unbelievably dull, dull, dull. I can't finish it."
4,"great book, easy, no problems buy","I'm in love with this book. A great read. Only concern I have to mention is the packaging. I love that it was minimal, little waste. Its a brown recylced paper envelope, cerial box cardboard for support(love this, no reason to throw it away or recycle when you can reuse it!, and wrapped in newspaper. Which is all great for the eco conscious, no plastic, but not too great for weather proofing. And in Jersey its been raining pretty heavily. When I got home, The package had been left in the mailbox and the rain had gotten through a bit of the packaging, luckily, the book barely got wet, just the bottom bit had been slightly affected by the humidity, but as far as I can tell, it dried nicely and is still in brand new condition.Great buy! Thank you very much, I'm extremely happy."
2,Really...????,This book has been written so many times before and it's just as uninteresting and i barely felt anything at the end of the book except maybe sleepy - xanax in print form without any of the lovely calming effects (allegedly).
3,"Very touching , real story","I was a little disappointed as I was expecting something as good as Interpreter of Maladies.The story of Gogol and his family is not that different, but the way J. Lahiri describes it, changes everything."
3,A sad picture of an Indian family.,"Lahiri has painted a sad picture of an Indian family living in America. I, also an immigrant could not at all relate to the relationships in this family. The children seemed to be ashamed of their heritage and the parents seemed to be without any true emotions. It took failure and a great tragedy for the protagonist to start appreciating his heritage. Or was it that they were so proper that they hid their emotions even amongst themselves? And what is with these Indian women and extra marital affairs? This is a second book I have read about an Indian family, first ""Brick Lane"" and now this; in both stories women have lovers on the side when they have good loving husbands at home.The only reason I gave this book a three-star rating is because of her prose and the description of detail which gave volume to her short story."
2,Lost its focus,"While I appreciated the use of langauage and the author's skill in crafting the novel, it lost its focus. It was also rather self-conscious and a glimpse into a very, very narrow slice of the immigrant experience. As a result the story lacked the hallmark of a great novel: universality.Nikhil a.k.a. Gogol, remained a bare bones character and the reader comes away with the impression that nomeclature is destiny-and that's all. The author has apparantly used this novel as a thinly veiled catalogue of mildly interesting autobiographical experience but the book lacks imagination, drive, vision. It is time for the author-clearly an adept writer-to take plunge into the unknown. I have a feeling that the results will be wonderful but this book does not get her there."
3,Exquisite chick-lit,"After I read Interpreter of Maladies a few years ago, I thought Lahiri could do no wrong. Her writing was just masterful. So I was excited to read her first novel (while living in India, no less), and was terribly disappointed.Here the writing alternates between absolute beauty to flat and dull. Furthermore, we never really get inside the head of Gogol. Everything just seems to happen to him. He meets a girl (and Lahiri will spend countless pages describing their make-up, clothing, etc), they fall in love, and eventually his heart gets broken. This pattern is repeated about four times.This is not literature, it's chick-lit. And that's not a compliment. Lahiri is an obscenely talented writer, but this effort was simply average."
4,Always An Immigrant,"Ah, all so familiar, so throughly, disturbingly and sadly familiar! Once an immigrant, always an immigrant. Nice and easy reading, very direct but intimate at the same time. Clash is within the individuals, as well as beween the cultures this time.I also have to admit there is a refreshing sincere and genuine quality to her writing style, so sorely missing from many of the UK-groomed Indian writers."
3,Not as good as her first effort...,"The Namesake follows the Ganguli family, starting with the parents as they move from their native country of India to Massachusetts. They then have a son, whom they name Gogol, a name that Gogol himself struggles with. He's caught between the desier to blend in with the students and people around him in America and the loyalty he feels to his parents and ancestors. Lahiri follows the Ganguli family, through the eyes of Gogol, as he struggles with his name, love, acceptance, loyalty and self-discovery.I thought this book was OK. It was a little slow paced and I didn't really feel invested in the book until I was 2/3 of the way through it. If you were only going to read one Lahiri, I would pick up The Interpreter of Maladies instead."
3,It's not the best but it's still good.,"I was looking forward to reading this after I read her first book. But I was disappointed when I finished the book. Lahiri's so good at developing and describing her characters. That it almost felt like I grew up with them. But in the quest to develop her characters, she somehow forgot to develop her story. I'm still at a loss on what the story is all about really since Lahiri had a tendency to scatter it around.But it is a good book nonetheless. Her characters are so well-developed that they all felt like real people to me. For me that was the saving grace for this book.If you like books that have well-developed characters or you're a fan of Lahiri, then read this. It's not for everyone but it's still a good read."
3,Recommended to Lahiri Fans,"Jhumpa Lahiri's The Namesake did not disappoint. True, I believed her Interpreter of Maladies was an extraordinary work, and I was eager to see if she could sustain such brilliance throughout a singular story. The quick answer is that she does not. But that doesn't make this a bad book -- just not an especially memorable one. Because the synopsis of the story is mentioned in most of the other reviews, I won't dwell on it here. There are numerous Induan writers out there today and this book probably suffered a bit in comparison to all (...) But I can't sell Lahiri short. She's a marvelous writer and I believe most people will enjoy her book"
1,Dissapointment,"Having read Interpreter of Maladies by Lahiri, I eagerly awaited her novel, The Namesake. Interpreter of Maladies was well-written, contained characters that drew the reader to them, and packed a lot of action in each short story.However, The Namesake was dissapointing. It is not as well-written as Interpreter of Maladies. The characters lack that something that draws the reader to care about them. The story is really a short story that has been stretched out to a novel lengh, filled in with unimportant detail.The story line is too predictable and there is little urgency in the writing. Where is the crisis to solve? If the main character dislikes his name so much, then he should change it. End of story.The bottom line: Read Interpreter of Maladies, enjoy a fine collection of short stories, but do not waste your time with The Namesake."
3,"Well, she could have done better","I got this book after Mira Nair decided to make a movie out of it. I have read the ""Interpreter ..."" which was a collection of short stories.Being an Indian student in USA, and a Bengali, I could relate to many things that the author writes about - the food, the relationships. Some of the emotions about going abroad and feeling aliened in the beginning were so accurate, they make you smile and think ""I know exactly what she means"".At places you would wounder whether she speaks from experience. All in all a good read, and a must for Indians living abroad."
1,the namesake,i gave up after the first 100 pages.lahiri should stick to the short story genre. the characters in the novel are bland and never come alive. after 1/3 of the book I really didn't care whether the protagonist liked his name or not. He is an unbelievable bore.a reader from massachusetts
5,A must read for those who feel 'displaced',"A superbly written piece, simplistic in style yet powerful in imagery. Lahiri has this way of pointing out certain details that accurately relate emotion or instance.Very easy to read, light hearted and possessing comedy, romance and melancholy. If you've ever felt displaced, a first generation East Indian (or from any other culture really), this book really puts things into perspective. Highly recommended - I've gotta check out her other piece. :)"
1,A parody of Hemingway's style,"The author writes declarative sentences, mostly starting with pronouns - Ernest Hemingway did this - but with great effect. She, however is a sloppy writer, a sloppy storyteller and numbingly repetitive. The book reads like a long, uniteresting news account. And talk about unexplored characters - the mother, who at the end, is somewhat of a feminist - how did she get to that viewpoint - never explored. Maxine - where did this Demetri come from - never was even mentioned before - all of a sudden - he's there - and Maxine becomes an entirely different person - huh? But it is the style that infuriates me - this is new? This is well-done NO. I had such great hopes for this book - but if this is what ""modern"" readers call well-done, I suggest they read Hemingway's short stories - see what innovation, and talent, really means."
3,Book,The book was in good condition. Of course next time I let my High school student order something I will make sure she double checks everything. She did not realize the book was in large print and she does not need it in large print so now we have to buy her another one.That is life
5,I really love it,"The story was very good, I truly enjoy reading the book was not able to put it down. As a foreigner the story feels like true."
3,What's in a name?,I never considered a name as defining a person but obviously this author does. I wasn't convinced he proved his case!
4,Nice insight to the mind of ones moving to the US,Liked the authors writing style but at times became detailed without really having a reason to do so. At other times leaves out details that would have really added to the story.
5,I was absorbed,"I read this book in two and a half days. I couldn't stop.My parents were immigrants from the Philippines, and I could relate to many things in the novel, such as the loud parties with lots of food, having adopted ""aunties"" and ""uncles"", and not wearing your ""outside"" shoes in the house. I understood how Gogol and Moushoumi felt conflicted between two worlds: the country in which one was born, and the culture(s) instilled by one's parents. I think that this novel can resonate with anyone whose parents immigrated from another country."
5,The best book I've read in the last year.,"As soon as I heard about this book, it struck a chord in me being a 1st generation American struggling with my own identity issues, I had to have it. It was beautifully written and pulled me in from the beginning, the birth of Gogol. Following Gogol's adventures as he struggled to find himself and happiness, the reader easily feels as though they're right in that living room with the Bengali feasts spread in front of them, or next door watching as someone dies or someone gets hurt and just trying to help the Ganguli family through the pain. At times, the writing jumps around and you're left with questions, answered a few pages later. But all in all, a wonderful, heartfelt read that helped me on the way to figuring out how to be comfortable with where I'm from and where I'm headed. I am recommending it to everyone young and old, with identity questions or contentedly settled into their own lives."
2,Novel lost its story,"I was disappointed. I enjoyed her intimate glimpses into a character's life in her book of short stories and many images stay with me from that reading of several years ago - a young husband imagining his wife testing the water pressure in apartments as she tells him she is moving out... However, even with more words, she says less about Gogol. It is a distant sketch of his life. Many of the emotional turning points are clumsily foreshadowed. As an architect, I found her poor research of the profession distracting."
1,whine and bore,"Lahiri deals with identity, a common problem with any immigrant group from anywhere to anywhere. To give an inept, philandering boy the suffering status of what is more akin to a refugee is laughable. Who on earth are these educated, capable but whiny cardboard people and why should we give them the time of day? Their paralyzing self-absorption is well served by Lahiri's simplistic and repetitive prose. ho hum."
2,A Dull book,"Jhumpa Lahiri's writing has style but draws from limited experiences- mostly that of displaced immigrants. After her first book, this limited storytelling, this attempt to extract maximum mileage out of small pains, gets boring. Gogol is named Gogol because that writer meant a lot to his father. However the author fails to show why someone would thank Gogol when surviving a train accident. At the end of the story Gogol finds the book of stories his father had gifted him, and cluthes on to it as a guide for the years to come. This is supposed to be the 'climax' but it does not evoke much emotion."
4,Namesake review,"I enjoyed reading this book. Jhumpa Lahiri created an interesting read. I would recommend reading the book before watching the movie. You get a lot more detail and insight by doing so. It touches on a common concept of kids not understanding or relating to their heritage. They often do not appreciate or realize the sacrifices and struggles their parents endured to give their children a better life. Gogol, our lead character, traveled an important journey of self discovery and re-discovery to find out who he truly was and where he was meant to be."
5,A must read!,Reading the first page of this book will have you not wanting to put it down. The words just flow off the page. The imagery is amazing. I respected the insight given by this book into one aspect of Indian culture. The descriptions of the foods in the book can make one's mouth water. This book can easily be read in a weekend and the story is so compelling it will stay with you a long time.
3,Pretty but ocasionally unsteady,"I'm thirteen. I got this book from the library after being enchanted by her collection of short stories, ""Interpreter of Maladies"". As with ""Interpreter"", ""The Namesake"" is written in Lahiri's simple, descriptive style that alone makes the book stand out. For the part of the book that follows Gogol's childhood, she focuses on his confusion with his name, as well as with his Indian heritage. However, after her protagonist turns eighteen Lahiri writes more about Gogol trying to find his identity, which happens through a couple of relationships. The first is interesting enough, but the second is a little redundant. The ending is also good, but has the slight feeling of Gogol saying ""I recognize everything I've done wrong!"" and ""Now I finally understand everything about my name!""Overall, I would reccomend this book, though not before ""Interpreter of Maladies"", which is a better first impression. Save this one for those of us who are already fans of Lahiri's writing."
4,An Ambivalent Tale,"The book starts off well with the struggles on an immigrant family and the adjustment problems they face in terms of culture, language and customs. Also depicted well is the way in which the protagonist's family tends to stick with their own kind in order to remain within their comfort zones. In a way, they embrace change by moving to a foreign land but are still tied to their culture and traditions which means they are resistant to change. Ambivalence would be a good word to depict the theme of the book.However, the cultural differences are overdone so it comes across as fake. The movie is also quite close to the book with good performances by Tabu, Irrfan Khan and Kal Penn."
2,Boring....,"I read this book after I read Interpretation of Maladies, hoping it would be just as good. To my disappointment, it was very dry and boring. There is no plot to the book. It's about a character named Gogal who is born and raised in the US. Honestly, if you have read one of such novels, you've read them all. So I wouldn't waste my time on it - there is nothing new and you'll probably skip over a lot of pages."
2,"A star or two more, if expectations weren't so high","Perhaps Lahiri's talents are more suited to the short story. The origin and continuing tale of how Gogol both got and related to his name is beautifully formed. The ending is particularly moving. Likewise, the evolution of this family as a whole is convincing and touching. However, I didn't find a single individual character, including Gogol, to be compelling. They were often more defined by their immigrant status than any aspect of self-invention. A certain determinism seemed to drive their actions. Add that to a preponderance of list-like details, especially in the realm of food, and, for me, The Namesake was ultimately disappointing."
2,Not worth reading,"This book was a thorough disappointment. The book can be divided in two parts, a story about the parents who left their families and immigrated to the US and the story about their son. The first half of the book deals with the parents and the second half focuses on the son. Frankly, I really did not care for the son's story at all. I am not sure Ms. Lahiri has any first hand experience of children of Indian origin being raised in America in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. Certainly, she did not come up with much to make the son look remotely interesting for half the novel. At the tail end of the novel, she starts telling the story from the perspective of the son's wife. The abrupt change in the novel did not make any sense. It was almost as if she was a short story about the wife and her issues. I was disappointed by the novel after having read her first book of short stories."
4,Immigrant experience updated for today,"I really enjoyed The Namesake, which was a selection of my local book club. The story resonated with me, as I know many Indian immigrants who are struggling with the same adjustment issues. I am also the grandchild of immigrants from another part of the world and can imagine similar struggles between my grandparents' generation and my parents' generation. Although certain parts of the story disappointed me (perhaps I was hoping for a happier, more pat ending), on the whole I was fascinated by the reaction of the two generations to life in the U.S. vs. life in India. I borrowed the recording from our local library and very much enjoyed the voice of the narrator."
4,"engaging, but not riveting","the namesake pulled me in quickly, and kept me there- but it was due to lahiri's lovely prose, more than the actual story.gogol, the main character slides through life (as it appears on the page), and things just happen to him- it's as if he is inactive in his role as main character and fictional human being.once i closed the book i felt gogol might take on a presence of his own... still, for such an inactive main character, the book has a quiet grace- not often found anywhere."
5,Simple drama expertly weaved,"Lahiri is probably one of the best new writers around. Her writing style, both vivid and fluid, can transport a reader to feel another's realm. She makes the most basic elements of life into mesmerizing pieces of literature.This book revolves around the first thirty years of a young Indian growing up in America. A simple novel revolving around him and his immediate family, this book delves both with his family's trials moving to a new country along with a new child discovering the world. Mixed in are tragedies, first loves, ceremonies, and a whole lot more. This book does a remarkable job in what is a book so real that at times it felt that it truly reflected my own life.All in all, a masterful novel."
3,Biased and Stereotyped ?,"I really liked the ""Interpreter of Maladies"" and did not like this book so much. I am a south asian living in the States and was sorry to see the book typecasting all indians in a particular light. There was nothing new for me.A typical south asian story ...."
1,"Depressing, Boring","What a waste of time and money. Not enlightening, teaches nothing. Boring writing that leaves one utterly disappointed. I only finished it in hopes something would be revealed at the end but as usual the writer misses another opportunity to make it even slightly interesting. So sorry I wasted my time, money, and brain power on this rambling, thoughtless, and depressing thing."
1,Boring.......,"'The Namesake' - a very interesting name for a book. I was intrigued....by the name, more so, because it was about Indians away from India.I thought the book started off really well. Then, it got boring....too much of negativity in the characters.....some stuff was predictable...but, on the whole I was BORED! Every night as I put the book down, I would wonder 'what point is she trying to make'. With extreme irritation, I got to the end of the book. I think if you read the last chapter, you get the message and you are done!I must admit that the last chapter is good....she gets her point across. also, a couple of pages along the way are quite nice....but, on the whole...I really did not know what was the point in writing 200 odd pages....I would say, even if you get this book for free, please do not read it. You can use your time reading many other books....or maybe even catch up on sleep...."
2,Pretty boring...,"Overall, I would say this book was pretty boring. I like books that have more dialogue and action than description and details. The one thing this book had plenty of was description and details. It seemed like Lahiri gave way too much background information and didn't tell enough about the actual story as it pertained to Gogol. I was really looking forward to reading this book because the movie preview made the movie seem pretty good. I have a feeling this would still be a good movie, but just not a very good book. If you don't want to be very entertained and enthused, then read this book. Otherwise, I would choose something with more action and entertainment."
2,Fourth Grade Level Reading; review by a Univ Prof.,"Without a plot, Lahiri's first novel seems to depend entirely on our interest in some rather dated cultural differences, more relevant to the 1960s than to today. And even these are rendered without much flare or uniqueness. As with too many recent writers of mixed background, this work is almost entirely a descriptive narrative of how one culture sees another. Although here, the vision is rather nearsighted than in depth. This may be another harbinger of dwindling interest in literature about ethnicity for ethnicity's sake alone; it can be added to an unfortunate range of such works that do nothing more than state the obvious. Grade school teachers might find this book of use, and indeed the protagonist rarely seems to get beyond a grade school level psychology. I would look elsewhere for subcontinent American fiction."
5,A beautiful read,"I adored this book. Ms. Lahiri looks at the complexity of families and the crossing of cultures. When a couple from India immigrates to the United States and starts their life here, where is their home? Which culture do they belong to?The book starts with the main couple and then gradually moves on to examine their son's life, and the conflicts between his parents' ways and culture, and his own as a first-generation American. The son is shamed by his parents' non-American ways and tries to create a life very separate from them. He makes many mistakes in his life until he learns to appreciates his family and that part of himself.I coulnd't put it down. A sweet, sad and smart novel."
3,Lahiri pens a gem,"A fantastic, one sitting read. Specially for people who live away from home. Gogol is brilliantly etched. The book suffers from some weak links though - Moushumi breaking up with Graham and even why she leaves Gogol - too hastily written in.On the whole, elegant yet easy prose and a very pluasible life."
5,Excellent !!!,I couldn't put this book down when i started reading it...the trials and tribulations of Gogol and I never wanted them to end...a moving book..Jhumpa Lahiri really knows how to get it right !!
3,Good but not as great as I wanted it to be,"I bought the book when I saw the coming attractions for the movie. The movie looks great and I thought the book would be one of those ""beautiful words"" books.I must confess the storyline grew on me, but I wish the focus was on the parents rather than the son. Or maybe because the effort was split, neither was really developed to the max.No matter what, I did enjoy and I'm sure glad I read it before I saw the movie."
5,Read it.............twice,"I read this book as soon as it came out, having loved Jhumpra Lahiri's collection of short stories, and I was not disappointed. I re-read it not long ago, and was just as enraptured as I was the first time. No wonder Ms. Lahiri has won a pulitzer. She's one heck of a writer."
4,Engaging Story,"This book tells an engaging story;it will resonate with anyone who has been an immigrant or a child of an immigrant. It is very readable, but in my opinion, it isnot a literary masterpiece."
3,The Namesake,"Interesting book, helped me to understand how people from India feel about being raised in a different country and what they are faced with daily. Easy to read and understand, the culture is explained in an understandable manner."
3,--,"This book was an interesting description of the live of the main character. This was the problem; it was no more than a story about Gogol's life, and lacked an actual plot."
3,Good writing. Pathetic main character.,"Bravo to the author who kept me reading about a pathetic main character. I loved Lahiri's style of writing, and enjoyed peeking into a family epic. The main character Gogol, though, is so distasteful. His whole life is a pity party: He hates his name (the hatred of which seems to form his distasteful character), constantly moans and groans about his confusing Indian/American heritage, not seeming to fit into either, and makes poor choices. He does not show any respect for his parents, which they greatly deserve. And he hops from one bed to another, not fully giving to any relationship. He is a pathetic human being. He has absolutely no redeeming qualities. Despite my distaste for Gogol, I enjoyed the book."
3,A Simple Drama,"The title The Namesake reflects the struggles Gogol Ganguli goes through to identify with his unusual name. This story is also subtle in style, elegance, and is realistically paced. It is character driven and I found the writing to be simple yet wonderful.It was interesting to me to read about the immigrant experience and the differences in cultures. To see Gogol struggling with his identity and trying to fit in was, for me, a reason to turn the page, to keep reading. He had to learn to accept his name in order to accept himself as a person.A haunting and wonderfully written book. I look forward to her next one."
2,Where's the plot?,"First off, let me say that Jhumpa Lahiri's ""Interpreter of Maladies"" was an incredible book, and one of my favorites. That collection of short stories is a five star effort. Lahiri is a master of the short story. I wish I could say that she is a master of the novel as well, but alas, ""The Namesake"" proves that she's human like the rest of us and couldn't get it right on the first try. The Namesake has beautiful prose and description, but lacks characters you can connect to and a plot. I think it's also lacking a subplot, which in reality would make this book a 300 page short story.If you want to experience the best Lahiri has to offer, forget this one and go get ""Interpreter of Maladies""."
3,This was a good read,"This book was absorbing and engaging. As I read, I was puzzled by the discussion about the protagonist's name until I realized that his name and his identity in America are the crucial point of the story. The story's vivid portrayal of the experience of one family emigrating to America had resonance with my own family's story, two generations earlier."
3,Not just for first generation americans,Anyone who has lived though the teenage years can relate to thisstory about a relationship between a child and his parents.
3,IT captivated me i do not know why....,"this book was boring and yet it captivated my attention throughout, i felt like i knew all the characters , Although it is not THE BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN, its worth a read"
2,Not impressed,"I absolutely loved ""Interpreter of Maladies"" and was anxiously waiting to read Jhumpa Lahiri's new novel. So I excitedly purchased the book and started reading it. It took me a week to finish the book and that was only because I was pushing myself to complete it. There was nothing about the book that drew me in, even though the material itself is something I could relate to being a first-generation Asian. Maybe it was her third-person type of narration that made it difficult for me to bond with the book.It's not a book that I would recommend to someone else unless they were wanting to know more about the Indian culture, or acculturation in general from a different country."
2,such a letdown,"I loved Interpreter of Maladies but this book was just terrible. It really isn't a novel; it's an incredibly overgrown short story. An incredibly overgrown BAD short story.It features a boring main character,a handful of underdeveloped supporting characters and a really mindnumbing narrative style.It was such a dissapointment that it makes me wonder whether ""Interpreter"" wasn't overrated. Maybe the colorful window-dressing of ""Indian immigrant experience in America"" was enough to hide the sad fact that Lahiri's writing is actually both pedestrian and shallow."
2,Less than Mediocre,"I won't bore you with a lot of fancy talk and misspelled words about topics I know little or nothing about, but I will say this: The Namesake is a major disappointment, mainly because it's really a short story painfully dragged out for 300 pages and because there are so many missed opportunities in the narrative (e.g., Gogol's trip to India, a section which receives only a few pages of weak exposition). I'd like to say, also, that the number of five-star reviews of The Namesake on this site is bewildering. It's as if Ms. Lahiri's brilliant collection of short stories (and they are just that, brilliant) has somehow awed readers into thinking she can do no wrong. I can only hope that Ms. Lahiri very quickly puts her less than mediocre first novel behind her and goes back to what she writes best, short fiction."
2,Didn't keep my interest,"Maybe this book should have been half as long. By the end of the book, I really had no interest in what Gogol was thinking or doing. The initial descriptions of the Ganguli family's struggles to adapt to life in the United States was interesting both between generations and genders. I particularly liked the food adaptions. I felt more sympathy for Gogol's parents and their struggles than for him.For those readers interested in a book for young people about a young girl and her family from India and her cultural adaption to Iowa, I recommend Blue Jasmine by Kashmira Sheth."
2,Disappointingly bland...,"Of all the professional reviews I have read so far, I think only Kirkus got it right; The Namesake is disappointingly bland. It seems to me that Lahiri wrote a very long and detailed short story which I happened to think is her best medium. After finishing the book, I asked myself ""what's the point of the book."" There are lots of cliches about immigrant experiences in America, and Lahiri's calm and drama-less tones made seem this book very long. In the end, I didn't really care about any of the characters. Overall, this book like so many hyped books, is overly praised."
3,nice but unspectacular novel,"this novel bears the unfortunate burden of living up to expectations created by its pullitzer prize winning predecessor. i did not read the previous book, to be clear, but knowing Lahiri won a pullitzer for it, made me give this a try when a friend lent it to me.from this readers' perspective, it is a perfectly good novel -- interesting, thoughtful, well-written. but nor is it great, in my view. certainly not pullitzer calibre. perhaps the previous book was much better or maybe lahiri, a beginning author, is getting overhyped. the writing is good, but not good enough to stand out among other top novelists. equally, the immigrant/generational story is interesting but i did not gain any great insight here or find myself moved the way i am by my favorite novels.in fairness to lahiri, this is her first novel and i think the hype has done her a disservice."
3,Passive writing,"I haven't read all the other reviews, so I may be repeating what others have said. The plot of this story is interesting, as are the characters. However, the author's writing style creates such a distance between the reader and the story that it's hard to get too connected to it. The story is mostly narrative, with very little conversation. Not much seems to happen directly, it is all told in the passive voice. This makes it really hard to feel for the characters. I would've liked this book much more if the writing style were different."
5,True gifts,"I received this book as a gift of thanks from a wonderful friend. He always finds unique novels for me, ones that deal with reading and its value in our lives. ""The Namesake"" is his penultimate reading theme gift to me.Gogol Ganguli's life is founded in reading, in its importance in Indian culture, and in the stories and characters found in literature. His father's attachment to the Gogol's short story ""The Overcoat"" (""The Cloak"") is the source of Gogol the son's name and cultural confusion. His lack of cultural identity while living in a home founded on that identity make him seem hollow. Gogol fleshes out in his thirties, at the end of the novel, where his story truly begins.I found the novel to be an enlightening view of new first-generation American issues, and a great opportunity to learn about the personal lives of immigrated Indian families. I think Lahiri's characterizations were also commentaries about Bengali culture in America."
4,Many immigrants and first generation Americans may relate,"Bittersweet and moving. Though I am from the Jamaican culture, I found that I related well to the Bengali immigrant struggle. If you are looking for a happy, fluffy book, this is not the book for you. However, if you are looking for some depth this book is for you. It was disturbing though how immoral and deeply flawed the adult Americanized characters became. Unless you are excessively sensitive and would become disillusioned by the Americanized character's bouts of immorality, I recommend this book."
5,Love it,I love this book. I love all of this author's books; she is so engaging with her writing. Please write another one!
3,Good read,The Namesake is a wonderful book. I enjoyed the brief lesson on Indian culture and the plight of the torn main character between 2 cultures. It almost makes you jealous to not be so diverse in your upbringing or beliefs. The main characters are all flawed and very real. It was nice to read from the inside looking out rather than the opposite as most of us do.
2,a disappointment,"I loved Interpreter of Maladies but felt that Lahiri was unable to grow into the novel format. Though beautifully written in parts, the novel does not hold together as a whole. None of the characters are fully developed and some of the recurring themes (like Gogol's name) become formulaic and trite. Also, as a northeasterner who has lived in all the cities where Gogol lives I felt her constant references to specific locations was a shorthand that would date her book. Finally, I must say that I know people who fit into the yuppie/urban hip NYC milleu that she depicts and liked them even less in the book."
4,I will read all of her books now,I loved this book that I will absolutely read everything else she has ever published and everything else that she will ever write. Thank you Jhumpa Lahiri!
3,"Enjoyable, But Unmoving","I read the Namesake for a book club amid the normal hype that a pulitzer prize winning author receives and I found myself anticipating that SOMETHING interesting would happen. It never did. I kept reading hoping something serious or dramatic would ocurr. But it didn't.Although the writing was eloquent and clear, the plot lacked the feeling and emotion that would have made me truly enjoy the book and embrace the characters. The ending of the book also seemed rushed.In short, this book is well written but unemotional and unmoving."
3,Aiming for another award Jhumpa?,"Though Miss Lahiri has a way with words, she seems to have gone out of her way to depict young women of Indian origin in a ""progressive"" light. This means female empowerment to the extreme! If Ashima was the perfect Indian wife (a bad thing, the author wants us to think), Moushumi was the polar opposite (she rebelled and went to France and had sex with everybody who made a pass at her. Miss Lahiri wants us to think of her as a free spirit. (...).The book appears chopped up and flounders as it nears the end."
4,"Not a classic, but has merit","Several points about this work:- Not the best written piece I've read, but quick and well done none the less- First generation Indians/Asians or foreign-born Indians/Asians will be able to relate very well to this book, perhaps much better than Americans can- Good if you fall into the late 20s-early 30s demographic, semi-affluent, like wine and good friends"
3,"Eh, OK","I found the writing to be VERY good, but the storyline was rather boring. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen throughout the book. It was interesting in terms of learning how the character views and deals with his Indian culture and background as an American. But it certainly was not a page turner."
2,easy living,"this book reads like a short story writer attempting to write a novel, which - in fact - it is. her prose is elegant, but it always falls short of poetic, lyrical, or even simply beautiful. instead, she relies on namedropping her good taste in a variety of things (in music, films, books, and architecture), romanticizing academia within the bengali community in the west, and very cheaply taking advantage of the recent re-interest in indian culture. if jhumpa lahiri had not been born into a bengali family, it is difficult for me to fathom that she would have very much to write about.but that's just my opinion. if you do yoga on the weekends, take pride in the fact that you can go to an indian restaurant and order ""tandoori chicken"" by name, and enjoy listening to ravi shankar roughly once a year, i'm sure you'll love this book."
3,"Lovely, But No Masterpiece","Jhumpa Lahiri has a particular talent for describing the textures of life both inner and outer - the Gangulis of the ""The Namesake"" come alive through vivid descriptions of their home, their food, and their quiet, unspoken feelings of alienation from the world of clashing cultures they inhabit. These details are rendered in lovely, deliberate prose, and the book is a pleasant one for curling up on the couch on a particularly lazy afternoon. Lahiri has a distinctive voice - no small accomplishment - and she is a very talented writer, but not yet a great one. ""The Namesake"" - like ""Interpreter of Maladies"", Lahiri's slightly better short-story collection - is very good, but lacks the passion that makes good works great. The Gangulis are well-drawn, multi-dimensional characters; they just need a dose of passion to bring them to life. Lahiri's writing describes, it narrates, but it lacks vibrancy and any hint of danger. When it becomes less inhibited, it will be truly great."
3,Better written as three short stories,"The book can easily be divided into three or four short stories rather than having it be one story. The book is divided into sections--- the parents, Gogol life through school, his adult unmarried life and then finally his work and search for mate. Although Gogol is the character who is the main focus of the book, at the end there is an attempt to narrate the story from his wife's perspective. I was convinced that Ms. Lahiri should have written several short stories rather than write it as a novel. My brother and I were born in India and raised in the US and so some of the themes she raises are familiar. However, I was convinced that she knew and understood what she was writing about when she relayed Gogol's story to us. After reading her first book of short stories, this book was truly disappointing."
2,Good and then---boring as heck.,"I give the first seventy pages, or so, of this book, three stars. It is an interesting tale that draws you into the lives of a family. All of a sudden, when Gogol becomes Nikhil, the storyline bogs down and then crawls at a snail's pace. Nikhil becomes a snobbish, unlikeable guy, and he is very hard to take. At this point, and right up to its conclusion, the book gets one star, at best. I know the author received the Pulitzer for her short story collection. I may check that book out, one of these days, but I will steer clear of this author's later work if she sticks with writing novels. One novel, by her, is all I can take, I'm afraid."
3,"Blather, drivel, and *yawn*","I don't want to be harsh, but this book didn't move me. There's lots of east coast ""society"" references in this book which did nothing for me at all, lots of cooking references for things like creme brulee, which did even less, some talk about Prada shoes or something like that and all along I was thinking ""Where's India""? Nowhere to be found. It seems like the main conflict of the story was a relationship gone wrong, but this happened so late in the book that it seemed pointless by then, and then it was kind of glossed over so as to seem unimportant anyway. The author is very good at explaining details but not necessarily emotion. She very often puts the action in the present tense which is curious, and began to seem like a device. I didn't find much spice in this story: no rising conflict, no action or suspense, it was just a bunch of bland tasting pudding - like a flavorless creme brulee."
1,Poor condition,"This product arrived looking like it had been dug out of a barrel, pages bent and dirty looking. I haven't wanted to pick it up and read it."
5,Emotional Mesmorizing First Novel,It's always interesting learning about a new culture from books. But reading a book about Bengali's written with such poetic language and detail makes the story all the much better.
1,Lacking in follow-through,"Although the writing in this novel was lovely at points, I was quite disapopinted given the author's prestige as a pulitzer prize winner. I felt that the plot was a series of relationships which lacked a detailed exploration of character and endings of the relationships. we never come to discover why relationships end. all of a sudden the main character is not interested anymore. relationships that seem passionate are suddenly vacant. I felt the author did not flesh out the details, possible conversations, which would have made it more riveting."
1,I Hate This Book,"Honestly, I hated this book. The reviewer who said Lahiri is a short story writer who tried to stretch one (short story) into a novel is correct. Right on the money. While Lahiri's prose is cool and controlled in ""The Namesake,"" it is also flat and the book is just plain boring, trite and so cliched. I hated every minute I spent reading it. Everything was flat, everything was so...blah.I hated this book from the first page to the last and I won't be reading Lahiri again. I think she's just a boring writer with very little to say. If any of her characters really do resemble real people, I don't want to know them.Blah."
2,For heavens sake forget about the name.,"I had seen this book on the 10 ten list for weeks and thought I would try it. I have no idea why it was on a top ten list!The book has no plot, few emotions, no characters to embrace and no drama. There are a few glimpses into Indian culture which I appreciated but not enough to make the book worthwile. An easy read, a glimpse into Indian culture but not a top ten.Maybe if the child had had a proper name!!"
5,"Eat the meat, throw away the bones!","The spiritual techniques and practices offered in this book are effective, easy to understand and to practice. The author's research into spiritual practices from various sources is extensive. There are so many techniques to choose from, it may seem a little overwhelming at first. My favorite is the Metta technique (which by itself is worth the price of the book). It is VERY effective. It's an easy way to get centered, to relax, release,forgive and extend compassion. You may find that you do not agree with everything the author writes from his viewpoint and experience, but the spiritual practices he outlines are drawn from various spiritual paths and are time-tested and universal. The Direct Path is a beautiful work, a spirituality manual,a treasure trove of information and one of the best books I've read on how to practically apply spiritual techniques to your life. Enjoy! Peace and love!"
2,Flakes okay by me...,"So Andrew Harvey can lead us all to God, can he? I guess that must mean he has reached the goal? Well, doubtful, from what I know of the man. Not that there's anything wrong with being an intellectual, a lecturer, a 'celebrity' in the spiritual marketplace - with it's fancy restaurants, cigarettes and fine wine - but, that's a far cry from the lives of the truly spiritual. Still, an interesting read, and, let's face it, spiritual information is probably more desireable to most of us than spirituality lived. Long live the New Age!"
3,United We Stand....meh,"United We Stand...Hillong United's latest album. My own opinion: the album is very good, has a very good vice but it sounds like a Look To You Pt. 2, I mean, i love Look To You, it's my fav United album, but this new album it's more of the same, it has very good songs like Came To The Rescue, The Time Has Come, Hallelujah but I don't consider it as their best one. I recommend it but I recomment Look To You more. The dvd that comes with it: the only good thing is the documental of the history of United cuz the concert, since they're using new effects, they put in so much in like 5 seconds, it's just too much, you cant appreaciate the concert, it was like 6 takes on a drum cut that it's hard to concentrate. But over all it's a good album, not their best but a very good one if you like listening to worship/rock songs. I can't wait for Hillsong's new album ""Mighty To Save"" and the spanish version of United We Stand"
4,One of the betters,"Wow! When I first heard this album, I was blown away. The interim Selahs really add a prayer-type mood to the listening/worship experience. I find that this is probably my third favorite of all of the United series so far (including More than Life, Love Never Fails, United We Stand, All of the Above, I Heart)."
5,Inspiring!!,Going through a rough time in life and this cd is so inspiring!!! Amazing collection of worship!
3,Classic Hoyt Axton,"A good production of Axtons' classic compositions, though some of the live performance recordings are less than stellar. If you are looking for ""The Pusher"" that was part of the ""Easy Rider"" soundtrack, you need to get Steppenwolf's version--not this one."
5,Great instructional tool,"I have both this volume and volume 2. This one (Volume 1) has a great range of styles Straight Eights, Shuffle, Sixteenths are found on both volumes 1 and 2 however with different tempos and feel. This volume has more of a ""programmed"" accompaniment. In other words, a lot of the bass tracks are synthesized. However, it's still a great tool to learn how to approach the various styles of music. I love both. I currently study with Dave, and use it in our sessions."
4,unique gift,"I bought this gift for someone who loved speedy gonzalez as a child, so it was a unique gift. It was a little smaller than I thought it might be, but it served its purpose."
4,Time for beauty,"My husband picked this out for our new computer, because it is much more elegant than the one we had before. He got the computer desk first, put it together and loved it. He then sent me back to get the hutch. That is when we hit the problem. I went back to the store 4 times to get 4 different hutches, ALL broken. Finally I called the manager and spoke with her and let her know what was going on and she not only gave me a discount but she put it together. She also had trouble finding one that wasn't broken from being mishandled. We have had ours now for 2 months and we use it all of the time. And we love it. Plus we always get complements on it. We have since bought the File cabinet ( love it) and the bookshelves ( which we took back do to their unstability). But over all we love what we got. And Target redemed themselves by what that manager did, thank you."
1,Received only half a hutch!,"After reading countless poor reviews of the Dolce desk and hutch, I was quite skeptical about ordering it online. ... I gave in and ordered the set from target.com. The desk arrived in almost perfect condition (a few smudges in the stain); however, only half the hutch was in its box! The entire drawer (left side of hutch) was missing, the hardware was missing, and the assembly instructions were missing. ... I recommend calling your local Target store to check the Dolce collection's availability (and the parts inside!) before you waste the time and gas to get there. Aside from the missing hutch, the desk looks really great in my home office."
1,Looked good but flimsy and arrived broken,"I sent this back immediately. It arrived with a huge piece broken out of the inside of one of the shelves, which must have been difficult to do when it was packaged, leading me to believe it was broken in the factory before packaging. I was thinking of getting a replacement, but the shelves seemed wobbly. Glad I didn't get the replacement as the matching bookcase and printer stand/filing cabinet have also broken."
5,Fast and Beautiful!,"I received this hutch just three days after I ordered it, and it was in flawless shape when it got here. The color is beautiful, and the piece is very heavy, sturdy solid wood. The desk in this set was a bit too small for what I was needing, so I ordered a walnut dining table from Target, and they blend wonderfully well together. The hutch is pretty large, so it holds quite a bit of office supplies, paperwork, etc. You won't go wrong with this choice."
5,Great Piece of Furniture,"I am very pleased with the quality and appearance of these two pieces. I was looking for something nice and affordable but not particle board. I found it at Target. This set matches my dining set perferctly. Everyone thinks I bought them all together. Like the others, there was a small issue of a broken peg in the standing shelf part of the hutch. I love putting things together and this was one of the easier pieces to assemble. Not a lot of screws and bolts."
4,Dolce Desk and Hutch,"I really love this set!, I purchased it for my 12 year old daughter's room....It is functional yet not obnoxiously big. Is it as sturdy as some desks?, probably not, but for the style and functionality, it suits our purpose just fine!"
5,Very Elegant and Useful,"This addition to my desk was so easy to put together. Just put the pegs in to the holes, add screws, and voila! The wood is very sturdy and it's finish is lovely. Having the hutch on my desk makes my apartment look more homey, and less stark, it breaks up the monotony of the white walls, and the cubbies and drawer are very useful for organizing bills, pictures, books paper, pens and pencils!"
3,Tasty but tightly screwed,"My semi-half-stepdaughter is going into her second year of college. Congratulations strawberry shortcake!! She was in need of a new desk for her dormitory so I purchased this magnificent walnut desk. And it's walnut. Who doesn't enjoy a tasty walnut during snack time? A lunatic I'm telling you. Anyway, this is a desk for champions, which is great, but there's a huge problem. You have to assemble it yourself. Tightening those screws manually is like trying to twist off a pickle jar lid that has been glued on. It hurts. Hire a carpenter. Do it."
4,GOOD!! BUT NOT GREAT.,"I WAS DEFINITELY AWAITING THIS NEW ALBULM BY THE STROKES. I HAD HEARD JUICEBOX AND THAT JUST PUMPED ME UP EVEN MORE. 1ST LISTEN SHOKED ME!! THE 1ST AND 2ND ALBULM GRABBED MY ATTENTION RIGHT AWAY THIS ONE DIDN'T. IT TOOK SEVERAL LISTENS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS ALBULM IS VERY GOOD NOT GREAT> IT'S DEFINITELY A STEP FORWARD. THE SOUND IS A BIT DIFFERENT, JULIAN TRIES SOMETHING DIFFERENT WITH THE VOCALS THAT DON'T ALWAYS WORK BUT OVERALL I ENJOY THE WHOLE RECORD. SOME OF THE EXPERIMENTATION WORKS WELL. FAVORITE TRACKS: 1. YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE, 2. JUICE BOX, 4. RAZORBLADE, 5.ON THE OTHER SIDE, 9.KILLING LIES, 13. EVENING SUN GO STROKES!!!!!"
1,Bad,"Their First Album was already over-Rated but this One is really Bad. Having Never Seen them live i cannot really comment on what males them so popular, but their Sound is too Sloppy. After an ok First Song it is downhill."
1,first 2 CDs rock - but this is really bad,"Their first 2 CD rock, but what happened here? I think all their creative energy must be used up, because these are all forgettable, throw-away songs. The CD insert is more interesting than the music (and how lame is that?!)!"
1,I'm sorry.,"I considered myself a Strokes fan. I have ""Is this it?"" and ""Room on Fire"". They would be on repeat for hours, becuase I could get into each song and love it. They were great albums, and I was very excited about the release of ""First Impressions of Earth"". But, I'm sorry, i couldn't get into it. It didn't attract me to it whatsoever. I heard ""Juicebox"" a few times on the radio and got hyped, but that hype was over when I got the CD. I advise anyone not to buy this album and invest in one of the other albums."
1,Can't believe the reviews.,Sorry folks I can't believe the high ratings for this CD. I am/was a Strokes fan loved their live shows but this CD is unlistenable a real disapointment.I always give a CD several listens before making a judgement and in this case more listens did not make it any more appealing.
2,Hopefully it's true....,"...that you never get another chance to make ""First Impressions..."", or however that cliche goes (it's true, of course)...But anyway, this is pretty much a holding action on the part of the Schtrokes - not terrible, but nothing particularly exciting or different, nothing that stands out. ""Juicebox"" is semi-exciting, but soon pales once the saminess and repetition of the Peter Gunn riff sets in...the most catchy, memorable moment is probably the Barry Manilow (!?!?) knockoff ""Razorblade"" - yes, the chorus quotes musically from ""Mandy"". So, nothing to be ashamed here, but I don't think this cements their career as they probably hoped it would."
2,Agree with most of the rest,"I agree with most of the people saying that this cd was a disappointment. It is. I first heard juicebox, and although its a good song, it was an odd choice for a single. I've listened to this cd all the way through about 5 or 6 times, and just can never get into it. I have their first two cds, and love them. They're last 2 are genuis compared to this. Now, its not an awful album, its just not nearly as good as their last 2. About 4 songs are great, 7 are ok, and the rest are awful. A lot of the songs just dont have the same catchy hooks and beats as heard in reptilla on room on fire. It seems like they tried to do something new, but it just falls flat, and gets boring after the first 4 songs. What a way to start out the new year. I honestly hope this year is better than last year for music, but its not off to a good start."
4,Give it a few listens before judging,"This album is really great, i would actually give it a 4.5 if that was an option. However, when i first heard it, i wasnt blown away. I have noticed with this cd and room on fire, when i first heard them i wasn't in amazement, but after giving them a few more listens, I realized that they were both very good albums. This cd is a great edition to The Strokes' cd catalogue and would highly reccomend it to any Strokes fan wondering if they've still got it, just give it a few listens before passing judgement."
5,The third impression of the Strokes is the best,What makes this third album of the Strokes so exceptional? For sure is the most sophisticated of all three. Also is the one that puts them in the list of the remarkable rock bands of the decade for using the cool sounds combined with Julian Casablanca's characteristic voice in an amazing result. It is really hard to describe the real cause for the feeling of optimism you get after listening to it but you will realize that this group is able to give much more in the future.
3,Nothing Special,"There are some strong songs on this CD (the first 4 are very good, especially You Only Live Once) but after On The Other Side it stars to drag. Several decent songs on this CD are killed by there bad choruses, especially Killing Lies (still one of the highlights, even with a weak chorus) and Fear of Sleep. The clever songwriting and amazing hooks that made Is This It such a classic (and were still around for some of Room on Fire) have almost totally been lost. A decent buy, but for you to enjoy it you have to realize these are not the Strokes of old."
3,third time sort of a charm,"Another good album put out by the NY boys. It's always going to be tough for them to top their stellar debut album ""Is This It"", but the good hooks and Julian's signature ""singing into a cell phone"" style are always going to be better than most of what we're hearing these days."
4,Good stuff inside.,"I'm huge fans of the first two albums and would rate those 5 stars. I would rate this one 4 just because i think it has one or two songs that could have been dropped off the album. With that said it is still a really good record, and I do feel that they push their style into some cool new directions. It's def worth picking up."
2,bland,"I do not ""fear change,"" nor do I find this album at all ""difficult."" I simply did not enjoy it. ""Juicebox"" is one of the worst songs I've heard in a while, and most of the other tracks aren't much better. The two previous albums may have been somewhat derivative, but at least they were pleasant to listen to. Apparently, The Strokes got tired of being compared to The Velvet Underground and thought they'd pull something out of their own hats. Bad move."
2,someone muffle his voice,"The first thing you notice after listening to this album is what a god awful vocalist julian casablancas is. He no longer has the clever production to muffle his voice on this one. He ends up sounding like some depressed karaoke singer after a few too many drinks on some of these songs. His wailing becomes unlistenable at times (""on the other side""). Of the 14 tracks here there's maybe 3 good ones (the first 3), another 3 or 4 decent ones and the rest being b-sides at best. They can still keep a good rhythm i'll give them that, but the vocals, lyrics and guitarwork on a whole is uninspiring."
2,"So much hope, so much disappointment","Given that The Strokes haven't had a huge hit in a while, you'd figure that ""Juicebox"" the lead single from the album would give some indication of what is to come. ""Juicebox"" as itself is such a rockin single; probably one of their best. After purchasing their album, turns out that that is the only standout song on the entire disc. Not to say it's bad, but well below expectation of a band that was onced called the best new band of the rock era. Better luck next time..."
1,Ugh,"Angst is so played. I had to blast ""Straight Outta Compton"" to get the taste of Stroke outta my mouth."
3,"Almost, but no cigar.","I heard the single a few weeks ago on Sirius and I was hyped, the instruments sounded better and Julian sounded he had a fire in his belly. This was the album to make or break them in my opinion. I got it today and it just seems to me that the singer is not on the same page with the band. The rest of the group play their parts very well and bring life to the album but Julian does his best to bring the atmospehere down. Too bad because alot of these songs do sound good and it's worthy of decent review but Julian's lack of enthusiasm and singing bring this down 2 stars. He sounds as if he's just gotten out bed and kranky to boot. He sounds like he's tired of the pressure and if they are still together for a 4th album they better put something much better than this if they don't want to lose their entire fanbase."
3,Relatively brilliant Strokes,"(3.5 stars) For the most part, the new Strokes' CD is the best kind of exuberant, straightforward rock 'n' roll that is generally missing from today's musical landscape. The first single, ""Juicebox,"" is certainly one catchy tune that I'll be listening to often in the coming days. As others have noted, this CD does show more diversification in the band's sound, so now there is more variety to their tempos and melodies than before. The willingness to expand and experiment is something I applaud, but it probably contributed to the album's slight ""sag in the middle."" In particular, I found myself drifting off a little during songs 5, 7 & 11, where the songwriting gets less interesting. Those three tunes are relatively forgettable, but the rest of First Impressions is great."
2,Boring. Get Julian back in front of a vocoder.,"This album is disappointing. In fact the more I listen to it the more I HATE it. The songs suck and I was yawning through most of it. You can't say that at all about their first two albums, which were genius. Instead, this sounds utterly conventional. The only good song is ""Ask Me Anything"" because it sounds unique, but you're not missing anything by skipping the rest. JC has abandoned the vocals-through-the-phone here and the albums suffers for it. Nothing wrong with the change, but it hurts when the songs themselves are mostly dull, throwaway junk. Also, the ""limited-edition"" package is a sham. While I like the interchangeable album art, it's ridiculous to pay extra for something that would have been de rigueur a couple of years ago."
2,Music limited by Poor Vocals of Casablanca,"I am new to the Strokes, but really wanted to like them after playing Reptillia on Rock Band. The music has a nice sound to it. It is sufficiently different enough, that I did not tire of it. The thing that kills this album is the limited vocal range of Casablanca. His voice is utterly average and it breaks all of the time. You get the feeling that someone in the shower could sing as well as he does. Lack of range and inability to hold a note are not good traits for a vocalist. He sounds best when he is just ""talking loudly"" during certain songs versus actually trying to sing. Sometimes his voice degenerates into words that cant be decifered. The vocals are somewhat akin to Thom Yorke's, except that Yorke has much more talent and he sounds better. Its a shame because Casablanca limits the otherwise decent music."
5,amazingly awesome fantastic album,"this is such an amazing album. it has a new sound, but it is still the wonderful music that we have grown to love from the strokes. i can't stop listening to it. i have to fight with my brother to listen to it because he always wants to have it in his car.i should just buy another one. it is so awesome. everytime i listen to it i love it more and more. if you don't have it, go and get it because you are seriously missing out on the best that there is out there.don't be a coconut. go and get ""First Impressions of Earth"". you should also visit there website at www. thestrokes.com. you can get more info on their other awesome albums."
3,Is this it?,"After listening to the cd and reading the reviews, I just have one question. Why did they switch producers? I can understand wanting to ""expand"" their sound and experiment more, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The Beatles went from 'Twist and Shout' to 'Revolution #9' all under the hand of George Martin. The former Stroke's producer seemed to understand them much better than the new producer(90% of the new record). With that said, I have nothing against the new producer, Sugar Ray, or pop music in general. I just wouldn't eat a pixie stick if I was craving a hamburger. The Strokes are still one of the most exciting bands in rock music. I won't go on and bore you with more rhetoric(positive or negative) as it's all been said before countless times on this website. When it comes down to it, I think the Strokes made a wrong turn, I just hope they can find their way back to Avenue B."
2,average&Change,"this album is a Make up for the 2nd album which was pretty bland.the strokes this time around go for that smooth&Polished vibe which is cool if that is where you are at,but it doesn't leave them much room for any kind of Growth.the instrumentation is cool,but there aren't any real knock out type of songs.the Strokes seemed to be on to something a few years back,but now they have settled for making that run at the Brass ring,but while they have plenty of shine here,there isn't alot musical glow."
2,No Lasting Impression,"I thought these guys were pretty much invincible when it came to making solid, short and to the point albums. Well, that time has passed. Unlike the catchy first two releases, this new release really has seven ""good"" songs and one really killer track which happens to be the first song. I still dig this band (can't wait to see them live) but i have already shelved this disc in the basement."
2,Disappointed,"Don't get me wrong, I really love the strokes, but their whole image and sound changed with their new producer. Julian Casablancas lost his nearly trademark microphone static. The songs are so much different than the groups first two albums. I anticipated this album so greatly, but found it to be a fluke. I even bought tickets to their concert, but the group seems to have lost their original sound, and this album is just mediocre. I prefer their older cd's much more than this one."
3,OK...,"I havn't listend to much of the strokes, but I loved Juicebox and that is why I bought the CD. I was hoping their would be more songs like it on the cd but there wasn't. Its a decent cd, kind of slow for me, but Juicebox is sweet!"
3,Not the most original music..,"Ok, the guys are good woth classic rock but, please, be more original! Juicebox starts with the Peter Gunn Theme, Heart in a Cage is Iggy Pop's top chart The Passanger, and so on. Now, I am fine if you look at that background but then move on or go for a cover album. Nevertheless, the CD is entertaining and perharps it can draw pop-addicted teens to classic rock while pushing them to look for the roots."
2,Slow Spiral Downward,"Oh, it is so great to see the Strokes experimenting with new styles of music; It's nice to see that their not just rehashing the same old formulaic sound off their first album. It is kind of a shame however, that the members of the Strokes have turned into ball-less pansy little girls. But that's all right because, you see, it quite obvious that they were going after the ten year old girl market, that's a huge market you know. I really like how all the energy, drive and artistic depth have been completely sucked out of this album. Who knows, maybe with their new bland parental approved brand of rock & roll the band would like to come play at my sisters high school prom this year."
2,Disappointing......Don't start here.,Their first album was almost perfect. The second was worth getting for about half the tracks. The appeal of this one is mostly lost on me.
4,Good rock does still exist.,"The Strokes are one of the better bands making music today, hands down. Room on Fire was incredible, and this album, while not being AS good is still a solid effort. The album starts off strong, with the better songs being first. Some of the songs in the middle get a bit boring, but the album ends strong and has some of the band's better work disperced throughout. Another thing that makes this album great and makes up for some of the weaker songs is the fact that it is quite dynamic and includes great variations in tempo, small unexpected breakdowns, and unusual bridges. The 80's rock as well as older Velvet Underground influences blend excellently into a good rock album. The only bad songs tend to suffer from sounding too much like U2 (who sucks terribly). Overall this album is a worthy addition to any rock fan's collection.4.25 stars."
3,"Not what I was expecting, but still okay","I loved their first two albums. This isn't either of those records. When i first listened to it i was more than a little dissapointed. Then, in a couple of weeks I listened to it again with more of a open mind. I was suprised to find out I didn't hate it. I actually liked some of the songs. I still have a hard time letting it play all the way through."
3,The Strokes Vs. Evening Sun,"First Impressions Of Earth je veliki korak nazad za The Strokes. Gde je nestao sav onaj smek sa prethodna dva albuma po kojem su The Strokes bili tako prepoznatljivi? Sa ovim albumom bend je na granici da se stopi sa gomilom drugih bendova koji se vise nerazlikuju ni po muzici ni po izgledu. Ovo im se moze oprostiti, ali sledeci album... Hmmm!"
3,It's all in the mix.,"The songwriting is there. The talent and hard worked arrangements are there as well, but it all seems to have lost what we loved. It has to be in the mix. This album is really loud, and all of the instruments seem to be jarbeled together. Julian's voice is often times hard to pick out of the other instruments, and the other instruments all seem to sound the same as one another. There wasn't that unique tone that I loved about every other strokes album. Their beautiful attention to tone is what painted ""Is This It?"" and ""Room On Fire"" into masterpieces. So if the strokes could just please remix this, maybe add some different effects pedals or somthing, I don't know, just do somethine because it doesn't sound right. However, don't let all this negativity distract you from the fact that there is some brilliant songwriting on this album, as well as some heartfelt performances by Julian."
3,A Minor Disappointment (3.5 stars),"I had high hopes for first impressions. Being a fan of the infectious juicebox, I had no idea of what to expect from the album. The first four songs are ultimately decent, reflective of the previous albums. However, the latter ten strike me somewhat as fillers. Though not terrible, the larger portion of the album is a tad weak. I had hoped for more. However, the Strokes are still a pretty strong indie garage band, they just decided to wander into new territory on this one, not a bad idea, but I think they could have played it off better. A disappointment? No, it just wasn't what I expected. The highlights on first impressions (tracks 1-4) are good songs and the rest are listenable, but I still feel that this is their worst album (although is this it and room on fire were great albums). I would recommend feeling the water before diving right in."
3,Alright,"The Strokes have done better than this, so I have to say I was a little disappointed.I don't think this is the end of their carreer though. Every artist has to fall if they're going to rise."
4,Is this it?,"The average person fears change.So when an artist/band decides to 'evolve' their sound, especially one with such a distinct (and arguably 'limited') sound as The Strokes, it's sure to draw a slew of quick reactions, many of them often critical.The first four songs of this album may very well remind you of The Strokes that you're accustomed to (or serve as an attempt to do so), but the middle (the bulk) of this album (tracks 5-11) will have you asking yourself the very same thing that The Strokes named their first song of their first [great] album: Is this it???Luckily, the best is saved for last as two of the last three songs revive a polarizing and arguably 'alienating' album. While this is easily the weakest of The Strokes first three albums and there is nothing 'new' here, overall and if nothing else, there are enough songs which 'hit their mark' and find themselves worthy of a playlist add.Three and a half (3 1/2) stars, rounded to four since ratings systems are simple and flawed."
2,Hay-zoos H. Kee-rhist: What a disappointment,"I'm not against a band changing its sound to stay fresh, and the Strokes haven't changed all that drastically on this one, but the quality of the songs themselves is downright AWFUL in some cases. Slow, boring, and often annoying.First listen: Not impressed, but not willing to make a judgement after just one. Second listen: Oh God, it still feels the same way. Third listen: Yep, they've got a stinker on their hands. No love here.I was wary about the whole thing when I first heard 'Juicebox' - sounds like Julian's been listening to a bit too much Franz Ferdinand. '12:51' was a bitchin' opening single a few years back. 'Juicebox' is lukewarm.The album as a whole is tepid."
3,He has nothing to SAAAAAAAAY!,"How the human brain can fool itself into thinking that this is the Strokes reborn is beyond me.At best this is the Strokes floating in limbo between two worlds,uneven, confused and sadly...boring.I do give credit for the first few opening tracks and the great booklet, but the album drags on and on until it's finally over.You want to try a new sound, try different instruments once in a while.I would recommend you skip this one and try something more authentic like The Stooges."
3,I respect that the band is trying to evolve...,"But it seems that this is one band that people (including myself) really like the original sound of. On ""Is This It?"" and ""Room On Fire"" they had such a new sound that nobody had ever heard yet. However, they have since traded in their patented sound for a slower, more slurred sound. Because of this change in sound, this album flopped.Although, it isn't a total let down. ""On The Other Side"" is a really cool song. I also really like ""Heart In A Cage."" It seems, if anything, the album progressively gets slower and more boring as it drags on. But the first few tracks are good. (For a perfect example of a sleeper track, listen to ""Fear Of Sleep"")Overall, I'd still buy it, as I'm a big strokes fan. But you might want to buy it used or on sale."
5,Elegant comfort,The clog was more comfortable than I could have imagined. It's cushioned and supports one's weight effortlessly. It looks beautiful and fits neatly. Looks great with jeans. The colour is rich. I got compliments the first time I wore them. Great buy!
5,Great SoftWalk Clogs,"SoftWalk has some of the most comfortable shoes on the market, and these are no exception. The SoftWalk Murietta Clog is a great shoe that can be dressed up or down. I wear them to work and on the weekends for play. They are stylish and comfy, which is why I own several pairs in a variety of colors, not to mention other styles of SoftWalk (the San Mateo is great too). If you have a wide foot and high instep, this shoe is for you. Also great for standing or walking for long periods at a time - you feel no pain."
2,NOT THE SAME,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS STYLE. I HAVE TWO OTHER PAIRS OF THE MURIETTA BUT THEY HAVE SMOOTH LEATHER, BLACK AND WALNUT BROWN. THEY ARE WONDERFUL. I ASSUMED THAT THIS EMBOSSED COGNAC (BROWN) PAIR WOULD BE IDENTICAL BUT TO MY SURPRISE THEY ARE SHORTER ON THE TOP OF THE FOOT FROM THE TOE UP TO THE BAND AT END OF THE ""VAMP"". THIS CAUSES THEM TO FEEL AS IF THEY ARE NOT STAYING ON AS WELL AS THE OTHERS DO. WHY DO THE EMBOSSED GET CUT SHORTER THAN THE SMOOTH LEATHER?"
5,Extremely Comfortable,"These clogs are extremely comfortable. The leather gets scuffed a bit too easily but I wear these shoes with my ""worn-look"" jeans so they go good together. I am quite satisfied with my purchase."
2,An interesting story told in a juvenile manner.,I was pleased to find that this book tells a story of the area in which I grew up - New York. However the characters; their struggles and dialogue are amateurishly developed. The way the author tells us of Iroquois language and custom brings to mind a low budget film.
3,"oh, the detail!","There was way too much history and detail in this story to keep it all straight. It was an interesting look at a friendship between the two female characters, Catalyntie and Clara. But at times Catalyntie was too pathetic for words... sleezing herself out for Malcom, who loved Clara. The footnotes were helpful, but really the only reason I completed this book was because I'd paid for it!"
3,Networks,Covers all topics in computer networks in a high level point of view. If you need more details should look for another book
2,Gets the job done,"This cooler will keep your wines at the prescribed temperature, but the controls are somewhat inaccurate, difficult to set and maintain at wine temperature (58-60) It's either 55 or less or 70 plus degrees, ok if you are just trying to avoid the hot summer temperature fluctuations. If I could do it again I would upgrade to something that had better temp controls."
1,this cooler for wine is not very good,"The first time I tried to use it, the cooler broke down. This item is a good for nothing piece of junk. The reason I say this is because I own it. I now have another wine cooler that works great from crate and barrel. When you think of buying a wine cooler dont buy this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!thanks for reading my review,Nico G. Hedley"
5,"Gimme More ""Gimme My Monie""","JackTerror's debut album is full of phat rhymes and good times to say the least. I was once a wandering loner, lost in a sea of melancholy, until one day, I came across the song ""Living it MF Up"" and I realized that's what I should be doing with my life, living it up non-stop. The lyrics are the most poetic I've heard since Dylan and are bound to have the same impact. The lyrics are only superceded by the musical genius he displays. The dissonant chords and myxolidian structure in ""The Pantydropper"" are the most original use of musical theory since Mozart graced this earth. The harmonic structures, the original chords, and the legato rhythms are sure to surprise even the most experienced of classical listeners. To sum up this is the greatest album, no the greatest CREATION, that the human race has ever contributed to this earth."
3,it's not that bad,"While it's true that there are a great number of grammatical errors, the story is well-paced and full of surprises. I didn't like that a couple of well-known Transformers die over the course of the novel, but it was was still intriguing. My other complaint was that the personalities of the characters in the novel don't really match those of the mythology. For example, I always pictured Soundwave to be a stoic loyal soldier to the Decepticon cause; not a sadistic weakling who runs his mouth during combat. Despite all these flaws, I'll still check out Book 2."
2,A big disappointment,"The only reason this book even gets 2 stars is because I'm happy that there are finally Transformers books for adults. The thing is, this is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read. First off, there's a typo on every other page. And what's with all the blood and gore? I know this isn't for kids, but the level of violence in this book is pretty disgusting. The writing style is horrible--it's just about all exposition--much of which is boring and repetitve--and hardly any dialogue. And when the characters do talk, they aren't portrayed well. Bumblebee sounds like an idiot and Prowl is like an army grunt. I've been a Transformers fan for a long time, and I hope the next 2 books in this series will be better."
2,painful reading,"Considering a move towards Real Estate investing I bought this book based on others reviews. What a mistake. Sugars dispenses his advice about RE investing via dialogue between Brian, Sarah, and ""Coach""--their RE advisor. I wanted sound, factual advice. Instead I got mad at Sugars/""Coach"" for his arrogant, misogynist tone--Sarah has confidence issues, Brian has ADD. This vehicle for teaching RE investing is insipid and the reading painful. I don't know enough about RE investing yet to determine whether the advice is sound or not, however I do know enough about business writing--an English major in college and an editor for a consulting firm--to say that if this book was ghost-written, the writer should be fired alongwith the editor at McGraw Hill who allowed this abomination to be published. If Sugars wrote it himself, well it's a good thing he made his money elsewhere. If you're into masochism and RE investing then buy this book, otherwise save your money."
4,Start Your Learning About Real Estate,"This book will be very beneficial to the beginner who has always heard about ""someone else"" making money by investing in real estate. The primary focus of the book is residential and it is told in story form as a young couple learns step-by-step from a pro.The importance of sticking to your own disciplined rules is stressed throughout. Also many strategies are shared to help each individual gain clarity in their goals. Other topics covered involve how to evaluate the numbers, renovations, and building a team of resource professionals with which to network."
5,Essential reading,Why didn't I read this book before I purchased my first property...I would have saved thousands.Brad's simple to understand yet powerful property negotiation and development techniques are benefitial to both the novice and professional developer.You will learn powerful techniques to buy the right properties at the best possible prices in any market.
2,"Works fine, but tedious to set","The timer is built well, with well placed controls, a good display, and a beep with a good volume. However, setting the time for each timer is tedious because you have to hold T1, T2, or T3 for 2 to 3 seconds before you can press hour, min, or sec to define the length to count down. Then you press T1 again, and finally press Start to start the timer. Far too many steps compared to the West Bend timer we owned previously. Also, to add a minute to an existing timer, you press stop, then again hold T1 for three seconds, then add the minute, press T1, and press start/stop again."
3,"Good Idea, But Poor Execution","I was thrilled to find this timer with multiple sets since I bake a lot of artisan breads. Some require a long rising, but interim work, so I thought this was my solution. WRONG! Once you set T1, T2, and T2 and start them, there is no way to reset T2 and T3 if they are set to go before T1. (For example, if the total rising time is 3 hours, but the dough needs worked every 20 minutes for three times, you can't reset T2 if T3 and T1 are still going.) Confusing, isn't it??? At any rate, the directions are on the back of the package labeling - you have to take the insert out of the plastic and unfold it. I wish this worked so that each time could be reset while the others are still going. Okay, but I like my Polder timer better."
3,"OK, but must be something better","I've had this for about two years. I've grudgingly accepted it, forcing myself to use it. It works, I hate throwing away something that works. But, it doesn't work well. The timers are loud enough. It's easy to see the numbers. But, it's a pain to set. My geek partner couldn't set it to save his life without reading the manual. After two years, I still sometimes have to think about how you set it. So, nothing intuitive here! Also, the magnet is not as strong as it could be. I've knocked it off of the side of the refrigerator more than once. The last time? The display was partially ruined. Now I can only see one timer, not two.Again, it works. And, it allows me to track more than one thing that is cooking. And, here I am at Amazon to get a replacement. . .but it will not be this brand."
1,SOY,"I can't say how much I hate this timer unless I were to say that I hate it with a ""fiery passion"" like another reviewer wrote. It is not intuitive to use. And I hate dragging out the instructions every time I go to use it. Even after reading the instructions I still don't understand it. OK maybe I am a technophobe. But when I do go to use it, it takes so long to set it that seconds whiz by. I had another timer, a CDN 4 function timer,CDN PT1A Digital Timer/Clock 4 Event Programmableand I am going back to it. The Bonjour timer is going into the garbage."
2,Bike O Boring,"The ride was endless - one elk, a few buffalo and some birds and lots of steam from the geothermal pools, and yes, Old Faithful spewing in the distance.....""abundance of unusual wildlife"" was simply not there.The music could have been much more uplifting - instead of the constant drone of tymp' drums that kept rising so that you expected to come across an exciting scene when the crescendo was reached only to be disappointed when nothing of note appeared. If I had never before had the pleasure of driving through this beautiful Park, this video would NOT entice me to plan a trip there anytime soon! Maybe there was no other wildlife around at the time this video was shot - but another trip through with some addtional shots of wildlife - which IS there - added to this video would have made it more fun."
5,So fun.,The episode us just so funny. The little bird is just so cute. I love it how the bird rats them out in the end for letting him out of his cage and hiding it form Ally. The music in this show is also so great to dance to. I just love to watch this over and over!
2,"Slow delivery, wrong filter","In industry, one of the things vendors are rated on is on time delivery. I waited way too long. I will continue to search for a vendor who is more concerned with delivering within a normal time frame, and one who carries replacement parts that are the correct ones for my vaccum cleaner."
1,BROKEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I was so looking forward to receiving this desk. When we unpacked it we saw that the desk had been completely broken off on one corner and then REGLUED and shipped to me. Now no one will take responsibility and as Amazon has no live people at their customer service number they expect me to ship it back to them. I have NEVER been so furious over a purchase in my entire life.
1,Missing two legs,"The desk arrived missing two of it's legs. It looks really nice, and seems easy to assemble, but can't do anything with it with only two legs. Will be returning the product."
4,I like this desk,"It is what it is for the price. It is sturdy, nice and elegant, but you can't expect to get a high end piece of furniture for what you paid. You need to be careful when putting it together, if you tighten up the screws too much the wood will crack and that will become a problem later on as the joints can snap any time. It looks good, and that is all I wanted for now. Like most cheap furniture it will need to be replaced after a while."
3,"Nice desk, but damaged",Received the desk and was a bit skeptical of what condition it would be in once I opened the packaging and sure enough it was damage at two of the corners. This doesn't look like shipping damage but pre- shipping damage. Probably some after market product that's being resold. It's too costly for me to return so I'm having a carpenter look at it for repairs. I only needed it for a craft project so it's not going to be anywhere visible by any house guest. My suggestion if your using it as an accent piece don't get it unless your prepared to have it returned or repaired. Other than that it's fine.
5,I Used Dolce for My Home Office,"I combed through many catalogs trying to find an affordable desk suite for my home office. I needed two workstations: one for the computer and one for sewing. The Dolce collection was the perfect choice. The color of the wood is very modern and the pewter knobs are cool. I painted my walls pale blue and included accessories in burgundy silk and charcoal pinstripe. I even found modern lamps in stainless steel and rattan to match the mood of the furnishings. My entire project cost less then $1,200."
3,keyboard drawer is a pain,"I purchased this desk over a year ago at the store. I've read everyone elses review, and it looks like i got a defected one. It never fails that every time i slide the drawer, if im not gentle it will fall off the track! And i have to pull it forward pretty hard, so that the little door with the magnet will close. Other than that i would have given it a 5 star. Its sturdy and a great piece. I especially love the walnut finish, it matches my mahogany furniture."
1,The draw falls open constantly,"This is a good looking desk and it is sturdy as mentioned by some of the other reviewers. However, it does have severe limitations. It is smaller than I though - very thin, so it is difficuly to have a computer and write on paper at the same time. Also - the REALLY frustrating thing about this desk is the magnet holding the draw closed. It simply is too small and weak to do the job. A SERIOUS design fault. The drawer is always falling open - you touch the desk and it falls open. I had to look for additional magnets and cant find them - i am trying belcro but it does not work. You cant leave the draw open because it jabs into your ribs while you are working on the desk - the is makes the desk pretty awful."
4,"For inexpensive furniture, this is terrific!",I assembled this desk myself within five minutes of bringing it home. It was so easy! I love the keyboard drawer - it keeps the desktop clear for photos and flowers. It blends into my living room which has much more expensive furniture - it looks like a million bucks!
5,"Best buy. Cheap, nice and clasic.","Very nice, esay to assemble.Enough working space without ussing to much floor space.Combine it with DOlce's bookcase, CD holder and file cabinet and you will have a clasic office fully furnished under $300."
3,"Nice looking, but the drawer keeps falling out","The title says it all. The desk looks nice. And is sturdy enough on top, but the desk drawer keeps falling out. The desk drawer will stay in place if there is nothing on it. I only learned this because on a couple of occasions, it fell to the floor with my laptop inside! Now, after less than a year, the magnet that keeps the drawer front up has weakened. So now, it doesn't stay closed. Oh well! You get what you pay for."
2,Scratched and chipped wood,"The desk arrived with a large scratch on top and chips of wood missing from the back. Also, the keyboard drawer does not align properly. This is not a very high quality product."
4,Just what I needed . . .,"Talk about a no-brainer. This desk is simple, stylish and exceedingly easy to put together. Just screw the legs in; the rest is one big piece. The color is closer to dark cherry or mahogany, which was just what I needed to complement the pieces in my bedroom."
5,Solid Beauty - I'm Sold!,"I'm a believer! This desk is a great fit for my small home office space. It's sleek, solid and sophisticated. I love the desk and folding bookshelf so much, I'm buying another shelf. Screw in four posts and a knob... unfold a bookshelf straight from the box... and you have an office in minutes. If you hate ""assembly required"" like I do... you will love this desk and the rest of the Dolce collection. Target.Com you've done it again."
3,Poor packaging,"This desk is really nice, but it was poorly protected in the flimsy cardboard box. Both shipments we received were badly damaged with major dents. You're better off buying this in the store and making sure it's not damaged."
4,Attractive desk at a great price,"""For the price this is a very attractive desk. Nice style and very easy to assemble. This type of finish can scratch easy, so be careful. I would have given it a 5 star rating however the drawer is a little hard to pull out as others on commented on, may need oil and although it was packaged very well, the box did get punctured and it had a tiny dent....but not worth returning over. Overall very happy with it and recommend purchasing it."""
2,Bad packed and handled.,"I'm really disapointed because the way it was packed did not protected it good enough. It got scratched on the edges and two corners of the cover were totally destroyed.I kept it becuase I really needed it and I thought was more expensive to returned it, but next time I will file a claim or something.Thanks."
2,Arrived chipped/broken,"I, too, received this item with chipped corners, scratches, and broken pieces. Unfortunately, the cost & hassle of shipping it back is not worth it, so we'll have to live with the damage.It's a nice-looking desk otherwise, but beware that the keyboard drawer does not fold down completely and may cause problems typing on the keyboard for long periods of time."
4,Espensive looking but damaged,I purchased this desk for my living room in which it adds much class. The only problem is while being shipped it received damage. I had to repair the drawer because it comes already attached which caused screws to loosen and rip the wood. My suggestion is to view your product before leaving the store if possible. There will be chip marks from shipping.
1,huge disappointment!,"The box was slightly damaged when it arrived, then I discovered the wood on the drawer had been chipped as a result. I went ahead and assembled it anyway. I was offered a discount of $50 which I nearly accepted, when I realized the darn drawer wouldn't shut at all!! I was so upset and frustrated at this point I decided to return the item for a full refund. What a complete waste!! Now my computer still sits on the floor of my living room.........."
5,Great Little Desk,"I wanted something similar to a writing desk but with a pull-out keyboard tray. This desk was the perfect fit for me. The color matches the other furniture well and is more of a dark-cherry than walnut. The magnets on the pull-out tray were weak and didn't hold. A quick replacement was all it needed. The desk is sturdy and has plenty of room for my laptop and small printer. There's also space for some books. Absolutely love this desk. I had been on the fence about buying it for several weeks and finally went ahead and did it. I absolutely recommend it. I'm very happy about it, plus it wasn't all that expensive either."
3,Pretty nice piece,"Over all this desk has the look of something you would find in a more upscale store (Crate & Barrel, etc.). However, the finish is low quality and there are numerous places (particularly on the legs and edges) where the stain did not take well. Issues with the finish aside, the desk is quite nice and the blemishes stand out only under close scrutiny. Deserves a 3.5 star rating."
1,How Do You Like This Album Now!,HOW DO YOU LIKE ME NOW SHOULD HAVE NEVER MADE IT TO NUMBER ONE -- LET ALONE FIVE WEEKS!!!!!!
5,where have you been hiding him?,"I reckon Toby Keith is damn nearly as good as Waylon. Consequently I'm VERY annoyed that he is as good as unknown in Australia. It wasn't till I was driving round Arizona listening to KCUZ that I heard of him, and that's a stroke of luck that won't befall many Australians. Toby, when are you coming to Australia? You can't hide from us forever."
1,"Nope, not for me","Toby Keith doesn't seem to exude a warmth and down to home attitude that most country stars have naturally. When Aaron Tippin and some others sing, you can just imagine them sitting down in their worn jeans and having coffee with you while petting your dog. I don't get that feeling with this guy. He's definitely commercial and I don't believe he'll last in Nashville. Country music fans want touchable and real. This guy is not that!"
5,( HOW DO YOU LIKE ME NOW ),I think this CD of Toby's is one of his most outstanding projects he has done yet. This guy made me love his music since Should've Been A Cowboy came out in 1993. My personal opionion if there were Six stars I think this How Do You Like Me Now should have it. The band's musical has a mixture of sounds not one Track sounds much alike. Toby uses those baritone vocals which are really noticeable on this CD How Do You Like Me Now? He is an outstanding writer in his music. He has some assistance but everything he does is Toby himself. He puts his soul into his hard work when he does his writing. I think what the problem is no one listens well enough or likes to Give Toby A Chance He is OUTSTANDING. I think you need to re-think your thoughts on this CD! (How Do You Like Me Now). 11/29/99
5,Toby Keith just keeps putting a smile on my face,The first time I heard Toby Keith I was hooked and this CD only makes me a bigger fan than before. I lent it to one of my friends to listen to and when I tried telling her which songs were worth listening to I realized I was pointing out just about ever song. After she heard it she loved it too. I'm constantly singing the songs in my head. This one needs to be in any country music fans collection.
5,HOW DO YOU LIKE ME NOW,"BOB ALLEN YOUR NEGATIVE COMMENTS ABOUT TOBY KEITH ARE SO OFF THE WALL AND SO FAR FROM THE TRUTH! TOBY HAS A GREAT VOICE AND A GOD GIVEN TALENT FOR SONG WRITING WHICH HE TOTALLY PROVES IN HIS NEW ALBUM ""HOW DO YOU LIKE ME NOW""! I LOVE IT AND THOUSANDS OF TOBY KEITH FANS OUT THERE LOVE IT ALREADY! SO MR ALLEN JUST SIT BACK,AND WATCH HOW THIS GREAT ALBUM OF TOBY'S TURNS TO GOLD... LIKE HIS OTHERS ALBUMS DID !"
5,Just Double Checking.......,"Back on Nov 29 of last year, I wrote a review....Mr Allen just hated this CD! I just keep coming back to double check if he has changed his mind..... This CD still make me smile, laugh, cry and think! IT MAKES YOU SING FOR GOODNESS SAKE! How sad he just didn't and still doesn't hear the music....."
5,This is his best work yet!,If you are a country music fan and like Toby Keith's style then you will absolutely love this CD. This is by far the best album he has put together. There literally is not one bad song on it. I am suprised he didn't release more songs off of this album. He certainly could have. I got this for Christmas gift in 1999. I listened to it so much the first two weeks I had it that I knew all the words to every song (much to everyone else's demise). It is one of those CD's that in 5 years you will be pulling off the shelf to put in the player to listen to.
3,Perfectly Executed Blues CD,"It's obvious that a lot of thought went into this CD. It's perfectly designed with well polished guitar licks by a tone ranger. You've got your slow blues, you've got a sad blues song, a cover of a ZZ top song, a song with funk style rhythm, a song with a mambo rhythm, minor chords, a couple of remakes of old blues standards and of course the cutesy song ""Good Booty and Bar B Q"". The guitar work is fantastic.But it just doesn't do it for me. It's too polished.I should add that H and WBs have a live CD that is one of the best post-Muddy blues CDs I've ever heard. It's fantastic."
3,Badminton,Well it was bought for a class and while not the most exciting book. It does explain basics. I would save my money though as most likely it has nothign that you won't learn in a class or lesson.
3,A lesser book by a great author.,"This second Chrestomanci book reads a bit like a cross between the author's far superior Charmed Life and Romeo and Juliet. All the typical Jones elements are here, but they never quite gel, and these characters are a bit too stupid and annoying to entirely please. It's of course a must-read if you're a Jones fan, but for anyone else, I'd say start with Charmed Life, Drowned Ammet, Howl's Moving Castle, or The Ogre Downstairs."
4,not one of her best,"This is a good story, but in my mind doesn't even come close to the other Chrestomanci books. It's really funny, and the characters seem real, but its kind of hard to get into and is not one of her best. I would still buy it and read it, but if it's your first Jones book don't judge her writing by this book, but read something like 'Cart and Cwidder' or the other Chrestomanci books."
4,Lyrically written,"The book captures the spirit and personality of Nathaniel Hawthorne. The writing evokes the time and period Hawthorne lived in and connects Hawthorne with other writers and public figures of the time. It is especially interesting to note how Hawthorne interacted with Emerson, Thoreau, and Franklin Pierce. Extensively researched and well written."
3,The midwife and the lawman,"Not that good, was kind of hokey . This writer can do much better. I usually follow your ratings, this one did not come up to your standards."
1,Not as described!,"I'm sure this product would work well for some, but I'll never know. I returned it immediately because it was not as described on the Amazon website -- in fact, it was a completely different product!""The dual-patented Dogmatic FreeLeash Hands-Free Leash System includes a comfortable elasticized belt with a horizontally rotating sheath."" WRONG! The belt is *not* elasticized; the *leash* was elasticized (I guess that's the ""triple-shock bungee"").""Carry your water bottle or doggie treats in the washable cinch-top holder."" WRONG! No water bottle holder.Belt stretches up to 55 inches. WRONG! Belt didn't stretch at all, and even the box said ""Fits waists up to 44 inches"" -- and I don't think even that was true.Amazon should make sure the product it describes is the product it ships!"
5,Best hands-free system!,"At first I was a little concerned it would be too heavy because of has a heavy-duty clasp, but it works great even on long mileage runs! The bag on the belt works great for a cell phone, keys, and doggy bags. But most importantly, my pup can run around me without pulling me into circles! Definitely recommend the product to anyone whether for walking or running!"
2,"Looks Great, Not What I Wanted Though. . .","I am a dog trainer by trade and I own four dogs of my own. I loved the idea of this leash, also because I hoped to get extensions so that I could have all four of my dogs on the same belt and still have my hands free.Well after purchasing this and trying it out on just one of my dogs I realized that I'm not so pleased with it. The elastic stretches so much that the dog almost comes too far away from your waist.The adjustment on the belt is not too high-tech and I had to make my own way to keep all the excess belt from dangling and being in the way.I hate the bungee leash it comes with and ended up using one of my own personal leashes. The bungee allows too much freedom for the dog to ""bounce"" out and then back. It's more annoying than anything.I may try the Buddy System and see how they compare. . . ."
2,"great idea, cheaply made",I liked the idea of what the hands free leash offered but it broke the second time i used it and my dog only weighs 19 pounds. The clips that hold it together aren't made of strong metal and with little tension and pull it snaped at the part that connects your dog to the belt. the belt is quite comfortable and it does have pockets to hold items which is nice. for this product to truly work you have to add your own little upgrads such as putting metal clips on.
1,Hands Free not for dogs who pull.,"I took my dog out for a run using the new Dogmatic Freeleash for the first time and was VERY disappointed. We didn't make it even a quarter of a mile before the front metal leash attachment completely snapped off and I had to call my dog back to me. I don't recommend this product to anyone who has a dog that will pull on the leash. Even a slightly tough tug and your dogs off and running which could really be dangerous! I don't think the claim the leash can hold a dog up to 80lbs. is true, my dog is only 54lbs. and it didn't hold up at all."
1,"f*** this worthless ""leash""","This ""leash"" broke the first time I used it. And by the first time, I mean within 10 feet of leaving the house, my dog pulled, and it broke. Now, some critics might say, the type of dog I have is inadequate for the ""leash."" To those, I say that the PICTURE on the front of the box is of a husky that looks exactly like mine. False advertising? Yes. I read reviews on here from chihuahua owners so perhaps it works for that type of dog. But, considering it broke within the first 5 seconds of using it, I wouldn't trust it for any dog that you don't want to lose. Especially for husky owners, an unreliable leash is a huge liability since they are known to run for miles without looking back, whether they mean to or not. DO NOT BUY THIS LEASH."
2,Wee Wee Pads Quality Running Down,"As with other reviews I see here, must agree I am disappointed with the recent change in pad quality from Four Paws. These were the best of all others I had tried, but no longer absorb half as much. I also find more odor in the house and need to change 3 times as often. I would rather pay a higher price for good quality than pay the same for lesser quality and the extra work involved in keeping the house looking and smelling decent. Even my tiny dog has trouble finding a spot that isn't totally saturated. Fortunately, the extra large size hasn't been diminished - yet."
4,Great product,We have a rescue dog who refuses to go outside in the snow (we live in upstate NY). These pads work really great for her. They are absorbant plus they hide the odor fairly well.
3,Not totally waterproof,"OK, but not the best. These pads do a decent job protecting floors but allow some pet urine through. Good for putting underneath a litterbox and catching leaks over the side of the box, but not for soaking up puddles."
2,Way too mushy!,"I bought these to line the crate for our 3 week old golden doodles puppies and they were bunched up, mushy and the material inside did not do it's job within minutes. It's back to the smaller pads for use because these just did not absorb and lay flat like other smaller ones that we have used."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"BEFORWORNED..........................................I have used these pads for years with great success.UNFORTUNATELY the quality has recently changed.I will NO longer purchase these pads ever again. They now mimic the cheaper quality pads, totally NON absorbant, shred easily and plain 'ol NOT worth it!I even went to the home company website to complain about the cheap quality.Why change something that wasn't broke to begin with ????"
2,Found a more accessible substitute,"The product is fine; the rating reflects the poor service I experienced. I had chosen to auto-reorder this product because one of my cats refuses to step in anything gritty. However, the last time the order was due, it was on back order. That was about four weeks ago and I haven't had an order delivered since then. The cat and I will settle for the smaller training pads that I can get at the grocery store."
2,Not as advertised.,I just opened the box that I got the other day and was very surprised that these are not like it says they are. They are NOT 28 x 35.5 and the quilting does not even got to the sides on the large piddle pad tray. Totally unusable for us since my little male dog likes to give the edges a run for their money. These are going back.
3,Love the pads except for one problem,"We house train our 11 pound dog to use these pads. One problem -- if you let the urine sit for too long, it will seep through the pads to the floor.I am hopeful that the manufacturer will correct this problem as we have no alternative at this time except to try to locate some plastic trays to place underneath the pads, which somewhat defeats the purpose."
4,Pads (x-large) works great for our cat,We have an old cat who does not use the litter box for his needs.We spread a pad out in front of their boxes which he uses.This saves a lot of time wiping up the fluids that would normally be on the floor.Although this is not a traditional use for the pads it solves a problem for us.
1,"""New"" Design does not work!","We've been using these pads for nearly 6 years for 3 small dogs that do not go outside...so we go though a lot of them. The last batch that I ordered are obviously a different design. They are very thin, and they leak.I believe my dogs have observed that they cannot walk on them without getting their feet wet due to the lack of absorbency, because in the last few weeks they have started to piddle on the very edges of the pads, which of course runs off onto the floor and makes a mess.I'm trying a different brand and will see how they work, but I don't think I'll be throwing any more money away on these. I know that cost cutting is very important right now for everyone, but I wish companies would give us the option of buying the product we know and like at a higher price point instead of trying to pass off a cheaper version of the old design. After 6 years of using these pads, I can absolutely state that they changed the design recently and it's quite flawed."
4,The only brand that works,"I have tried all the others, pay the extra money to get this brand, it's the best for a reason."
1,Not the same pad!!,"I chose the same pads from my previous orders and although the box/brand show the same, these are not the same pads. The older ones were sturdy and not flimsy like this one. Also this one stinks after one use whereas before it never really did and absorbed much better."
1,BEWARE!! They've changed their design!!!,"I have been using these pads for several years with great success until recently. My last box was packed differently and the pads are awful!!! My elderly dog has never ""missed"" a pad until this new box. Now the urine pools on top of the pad so she is wetting on the floor near the edge to avoid walking on the wet spots. These pads also leak!!! Never a problem for me in the past. The old pads would wick the urine away and leave the top dry for several days. These won't even hold one one incontinent episode. I am trying a new brand now, but trust me... these are no better than the blue pads you can buy at Dollar General for 1/4 the price."
1,Pads quality has changed,I have 8 yorkies from puppy mills who aren't potty trained so we use the wee wee pads extra large. My first 2 orders within the last 6 months worked great . I received my 3rd order today and they are horrible! They are so much lighter they move all over and don't hold the mess.I will not order again!
1,Disappointing,Haven't read a Clancy book for several years and am sorely disappointed at the poor quality of this effort. The most glaring problem with this book is the dialogue. Guys in their twenties making references to Grace Kelly and Maureen O'Hara? Simply awful. Too bad this author didn't hang it up while he was on top or at least collaborate with someone who is more in touch with the real world.
1,Could this book be any more cliched,"Ugh, this is probably the kind of book that destroys careers. Had this been his first book you never would have heard from Tom Clancy again. It seems that Tom has been reading too many of his old reviews and not those for his last few books. Granted his books still sell well, but that's because people see in his books what they want to see. This one is soooo transparent that it can't cover the weaknesses of the characters and stories.The idea of involving Jack Ryan, Jr and his twin cousins in murder plots is about a hokey as you can get. Put the boys in a Porche and let them drive it off a cliff a la ""Thelma and Louise"". Say goodnight Tom!"
1,Ditto,"There is a good reason this book is being widely sold at a discount, and plenty of other reviewers have already said why. Ditto, overall, to the expressions of disappointment in this book, and for the same basic reason: It doesn't make it.Gotta hand it to Clancy, though, for trying to revive a deceased idea. Sorry to report that even clipping the action in the closing pages to bring readers back for the next installment also doesn't make it. I, for one, won't bother. When it is over, it is over."
2,Meh,"Yeah this book wasn't that good. It moved fairly quick, so it was easy to read, but it was like a bad episode of some cheap TV action series.The entire duration of the book I could not remember which brother was Aldo and which was Baldo or whatever his name was. All I knew was that one was a Marine and the other was an FBI agent. Those two were just stupid, but not quite as bad as Jack Ryan Jr.. who to me seems like an attempt to just restart the Jack Ryan character rather than come up with anything new.It was also a real letdown with the action. I was expecting something different to happen, but they just stick three people with needles and that's all. As I read in a earlier review... it was like ""thats it?""Tom Clancy is really not doing so well."
1,Lots of Fluff and No Action,"If you like a lot of internal dialogue (""...but the wake-up coffee was good, as was the pastry...""p.425.) and plenty of useless, unimportant observations (""It's a German car. They make decent machines over here, man."" p.384.)then this is the book for you. I kept reading hoping that the action would pick up, but it never did. I was angry at myself for wasting my time with this book. Don't waste yours. This is probably the worst of the Jack Ryan series (Jack Jr. is now the lead protagonist of the series). I am so disappointed. This may be the last Tom Clancy book I buy."
1,The Worst Novel of the Decade,Where is Tom Clancy and why is someone publishing novels in his name. The worst novel I have read in 10 years. Don't waste your time with even a borrowed copy.
3,YOU DON'T KNOW JACK!,"I realize that no author, like no actor, wants to be typecast or relegated to the position of having to pursue a single character when hoping to broaden the creative portfolio. But Clancy must realize that readers, especially those who have found a hero, want to continue the story again and again and again. Jack Ryan is such a hero and we haven't grown tired yet.In Teeth of the Tiger Clancy's substitution of our hero with Jack Jr. and his cousins does not come close to repairing damages.The book does offer a well-written story, characteristic of other Clancy non-Jack Ryan novels like Rainbow Six, and may appeal to Clancy first-timers. But it's just not the same for those of us who have come to know Jack Ryan. The characters lack the personality that has become the hallmark of the Jack Ryan stories. Come to think of it, I think I will go back and reread Clear and Present Danger, Debt of Honor and Executive Orders again. You should too."
1,What has happened to Clancy?,"This book would have to be the most parochial pile of redneck crap I have ever read! I usually can't wait for a Clancy novel but this is badly written, repetitive and full of cartoon Americanisms - ""y'know"", ""whack the bad guys"", ""been there got the tee shirt"", ""out in the weeds"". At times it goes beyond hard to read, it is nonsensical! What a waste of money. Come on Tom - what happened to the style we are used to!"
2,This tiger needs dental work - Very clearly subpar,"I had high expectations for this novel, but ended up sorely disappointed. The characters, particularly Jack Ryan Jr., are extremely poorly developed. The Caruso twins talk to each other like actors in a bad 80's movie, constantly saying things like ""Roger that,"" and ""Bro"". Several phrases are inexplicably repeated throughout the novel, such as ""There's more men need killin' than horses need stealin',"" and ""being a spook ain't like in the movies.""The worse part of this book, however, is the ending, or non-ending, as the case happens to be. Nothing HAPPENS! There is no tying up of lose ends, not even any hint of a sequel. This and the many, many, unbelievable logical stretches that the author makes in this novel truly make for an unpleasurable reading experience. Do yourself a favor, and go read some GOOD Clancy - books like Red Storm Rising and Without Remorse are much better indicators of what he can really do."
1,Another disappointment,"Just like so many of the reviewers here, I've been reading Clancy's books for years, and enjoyed them tremendously up to Executive Power. After that, Rainbow Six was not in the same league and I got the idea that Mr. Clancy had taken the easy road, Red Rabbit was no better, and this one is pitiful. .......regarding Tom Clancy's I'll follow the suggestions of the other reviewers... read future releases from the local library or skip them altoghether."
1,Here I go again.,"I know, I know, why do I keep torturing myself? Why does an addict stick the needle in his eyelid when there's no vein left on his body?? Because he has to! I have to read Clancy. And yes, this one is worse than the last which was worse than the last..etc..etc..ridiculously unbelievable, absurd, rubbish. Moving onto Jack's son was a stretch, but let's see where it goes..nowhere. An FBI agent and a Marine, whose only 'training' in counter-terrorism is stopping a terrorist massacre while shopping for underwear, get thrown across the world and land just where all the most wanted terrorists in the world happen to be congregating. They expertly terminate each one, eat pasta, and go skiing. Of course, Jack Jr. shows up to kill the last one so Dad can go 'rah 'rah.We need to drop this book into the Afgan mountains, maybe Osama will find it and die laughing."
2,So-so,"Definitely not up to par. And what's with the dialogue? These guys are supposed to be in their twenties, but they're talking fondly about attractive women like Grace Kelly and Maureen O'Hara?? What, no Mae West or Carole Lombard? C'mon, Tom, get with it."
3,Gums of the Tiger,"I love Clancy books, just not this one. Son-of-Jack-Ryan should have stayed home. The entire plot felt like a rehash of earlier Clancy. No surprises, no flavor, and no depth. Lucky for Little Jack that no one seems to recognize him as he goes about his spook business. Give me a break. If Chesea Clinton so much as breaks wind in public, the tabloids are all over it, and her family is old news. The ending of 'The Bear and the Dragon' was a pefect place to lower the curtain on the Ryan saga. Jack-Ryan-The-Next-Generation is disappointing from page one. In all fairness, I don't care for Clive Cussler's Son-of-Dirk-Pitt, either. Mr. Clancy is a master. I hope he continues to write for decades to come. But not junk like this. 'Red Storm Rising' proved that he could do great work with nary a mention of the Ryans. I hope he decides to, because this book smells more like FANFIC than the work of a heavyweight."
1,Clancy at his worse,This is the worst Tom Clancy book that I have ever read. And I've read tham all! Very Anti-climatic and very boring. Practically no action at all. Very mundane. I guess that Mr. Clancy has peaked in his writing and now is going downhill until he retires. Oh well..... maybe his next book will put him on the right track again (hopefully). A Sequel to this one? This one had no ending. It was like he just got tired of writing and stopped??
2,Bah...go back to Ryan Sr!!!,"This was a disappointment. I think the introduction of Jack Jr. as a leading character should've been handled much differently. Definitely wasn't up to the same standards as his early Ryan books. Let's hope Clancy hasn't gone the route of many other authors who simply write a book to make a movie, ala Thomas Harris. C'mon, if you're going to write a book, MAKE IT A GOOD ONE!"
3,Not his best but adequate,"This definitely isn't Clancy's best writing but an improvement over Red Rabbit which was downright awful.Jack Ryan's son, Jack, Jr, becomes a player in the game of terrorist hunting and espionage. While Jack, Jr is only 23 years old, Clancy turns his character into spoiled brat of sorts. He makes too many references to his ""daddy"" instead of carving out his own niche and focusing on his strengths. The Caruso brothers are very interesting new characters but the criteria used to select them to hunt down terrorists is highly unbelievable. He also fails to mention how these guys are related to Ryan.Very action-packed with good dialogue among the Muslims and South American drug dealers. If you are new to Clancy's writings, you might enjoy this one. However, if you've read epics like Executive Orders or Without Remorse, you will come away feeling a little empty."
3,A medicore showing from a gifted author,"Tom Clancy is my favorite living author, and I was able to enjoy this book. However, it simply pales when compared to his other Jack Ryan books.I was pleased to discover this story was the most contemporary in the plot line, but was not pleased to see my favorite Tom Clancy characters delegated to mere mentions.To me, this book was little more than introducing us to a younger group of main characters to be used for future Tom Clancy novels. There is little suspense and the plot fails to draw you in.Jack Ryan Sr is now retired from government service, and the character of Jack Ryan Jr so far seems too much like his father to make him interesting. The Caruso brothers have character, but really needed a more engrossing Clancy-esque plot to make for a good novel.It makes me long for another John Clark novel."
1,Very disappointing,"I was a great fan of Tom Clancy but his two most recent books (Red Rabbit and The Teeth of the Tiger) are great disappointments. The plots are very slow and weak and the characters far too perfect and flawless. The leads have doubts, sure, but they recover from them far too quickly. Also the action, what there is of it, is lame and slow. I do not intend to buy any more Clancy books."
1,"read his earlier work, avoid this one","I've recently finished ""Teeth of the Tiger"", ""Red Rabbit"" and ""The Sum of All Fears"", having already read virtually everything else he's ever written (yeah, it took awhile to get to Sum of All Fears). Somewhere between Debt of Honor and Rainbow Six, the quality of his books takes a huge dive in terms of plot and character development. Unfortunately, Teeth of the Tiger doesn't buck the trend. Don't judge Clancy by this book; he's a much better writer than this."
1,What happened to TC?,Either TC has lost his touch or someone else ghost wrote this for him. I am [upset] at his editor for letting this book be released to the public. Dumb plot that labors from start to finish.
2,Nowhere near his best,"Excited about another Ryanverse novel, I scooped this one right up. The coincidences that bring Jack Ryan's nephews and son into a secret anti-terrorist group are a stretch to say the least. Too much time is spent on attacks of conscience before the action even really begins. The chosen method of assassination? C'mon now. TC has been much more inventive previously and the ending had none of the thrilling elements he has built his reputation on. Let's hold out hope for a return to the writing of old."
1,Loosing ground and readers,"This was one of the worst books by Clancy and sets a new low for his creativity. Boring, with little point to the story line. I have given up on buying any more of his books."
3,NOt quite a real Tom Clancy book,More like a Mark Greaney book. Lacks the depth of detail and background of the Jack Ryan series. Still has the slam bang finish.
5,A fun read,I read the Ryan books in order every few years. I like them as much now as Idid the first time.
2,could not finish this one,"This book just seemed to ramble on and on. I made it a little over halfway through waiting for it to go somewhere but it never did. The dialogue is forced, and not very natural. Tried to come back to it and still gave up."
2,Time to move on . . .,"Perhaps Mr. Clancy didn't write this book. At least that's what I choose to believe. It just isn't coming close to what readers of novels such as Patriot Games and Clear/Present Danger grew to expect. It reads more like Op-Center stuff.Time to move on to the next gen in this genre, like Brad Thor and Michael Hawke."
1,Lame ! And Clancy's fears show through,"Don't spend money on this one !!! It is worthless. I kept hoping that Clancy's prose would improve in the next page, the next chapter. Needless to say I was disappointed.The quality of the book is pathetic. The worst bit is the way Clancy side steps the problem of a black US president.Amazon.com, please add a 0 (zero) Star rating to your review page. This book deserves it !"
1,The Teeth of the Tiger,"A complete disappointment, predictable (even cliché) from start to finish. Have immensely enjoyed many of Clancy's earlier books, but nearing the end of patience w/his more recent attempts. Save your money!"
1,"Implausible, preachy, predictable","Take the Sear's and Roebuck catalog out of the outhouse and replace it with Mr. Clancy's latest. I had been a long-term fan of Mr. Clancy since ""Red Storm Rising"" and ""Red October"". I should have learned after forcing my way into the first 30 pages of ""Rainbow Six"" that he has ""shot his wad"". I know how crude it sounds, but this book absolutely stinks. The dialog is wooden, the plot implausible, and the medical/technical data is incorrect. I use the featured drug/poison on a daily basis in my anesthesia practice."
4,"Really not bad for a new ""era""","Jack Jr. is just like his father. Patriotic and faithful to his principles. This Clancy book, his first dealing with Sept. 11 (hinted at in the book), strikes a chord with the current global situation. It's a great way to introduce Jack Jr, who through his own research, figures out Hendley Associates is more than just a financial institution. In his early 20's, Junior seems to have just as good analytical skill as his father. While I'm not going to give the whole book away, it is MUCH like Rainbow Six in plot and character. It also leaves PLENTY of room for sequels which I think will be a very good thing. I'd say it's a must-read for younger Clancy fans who will identify with this era better than the Cold War part of the Jack Ryan series. 4 stars for the start of a new era."
4,The Teeth of the Tiger,"I just sat and read a pile of these negative reviews on this book. Could not disagree more with most of their points. Fictional books should be entertainment, believable or not, they are meant to entertain. This book was a very fun read.For all of you out there saying how 'unbelievable' it was that brothers, educated called each other 'bro' all the time... I have two sons, late teens, early 20's that call each other 'bro' on a regular basis, as do their friends. If this is not how the youth of today address one another, then I am apparently living in a time warp parallel universe.Doesn't anyone ever read a book to relax and just unwind? I found this to be a fun book and would have really enjoyed more with these kids as the characters.Guess all this proves is that we are all individuals with different tastes and appreciations. I liked it."
1,"Clancy's Fans: stay away, this is so bad!","This book was a huge disappointment. If it didn't have Clancy's name, I am sure it would never have been published, it is that bad!You have to wait through half the book before action starts: and then it is lame and boring. The young brothers' dialogues are a cliche of what an old man must think of young people: lots of swearing in the middle of a regular conversation, like if that was the only way we could grasp the fact those boys are not in their thirties yet. Come on!Mr Clancy, you have shown you can be one of the greatest writers. If you write a bad book from time to time, please trash it and don't get it published, out of respect for your fans!"
3,Would be better without the bashing,"As a gulf war vet (first one) and a democrat, I wish that Tom could cut down on the generalized political bashing. I have that in the news, I don't need it in my fiction.I have enjoyed his books from the beginning. I read my first TC novel on my old submarine. Red Storm Rising. I liked watching Jack Ryan grow up, Clark become an old man, and new characters, like Chavez joining the story.In this novel, it feels sometimes like it was written by an insurance salesman, with bad womanizing, plastic characters, and a more screenplay story than a novel. I liked reading it.. I want to read the next one, but I will be getting it from the Library and not buying it as soon as it is released."
2,"Good, but not good enough","The beginning of the book showed promise, only to be disappointed at the end.I would have expected more from TC."
2,1/2 of a story,"He's still long-winded, and seems to be getting slower of the starting block. The first 2/3 of the book are situation and character development, and almost no activity. When he finally gets around to action, it's thin, predictable, and ends too soon. I'm hoping that ""Tiger 2"" will simply pick up where ""Tiger"" left off, and get into the ""teeth"" of the matter immediately. I also found the right-wing political snipes both unnecessary and distracting. Stick with story, leave political commentary to Rush."
3,Teeth of the Tiger is a caged animal!,"Tom Clancy seems to have lost the art of creating suspense in his novels. He seems to write with the calm and precision that he instills in the operative characters in his book. While The Teeth of the Tiger is much better than the awful Red Rabbit, it still lacks the compelling suspense of Clancy&#65533;s earlier works such as Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising. Those I could not put down. I could put down The Teeth of the Tiger, but I did finish it and I did get some degree of enjoyment. Clearly Clancy is launching a new and younger set of characters (probably trying to make future movie scripts more acceptable to Hollywood), but I wish he would give them a little more fire!"
1,Teeth of the Tiger,"I've loved all of Tom Clancy's books up to this point. But this book was a complete disappointment. It ended so abruptly, I couldn't believe it. I just feel it was definitely not up to his usual standards."
5,FANTASTIC! One of clancy's best!,"This is Tom Clancy's best novel since Executive Orders. Now I've enjoyed the past few novels but none of them have been this good.A new generation of heroes is front and center in the Ryanverse now. The main characters are Jack Ryan, Jr and his twin cousins Brian and Dominic Caruso. The novel examines the mind of the Muslim terrorist and why he does what he does so it is timely for our day. It also examines the minds of those who fight to protect the ordinary citizens from terrorism. There is not much action in the novel but the highlight is a shootout halfway through the novel."
3,"Not bad, not his best","As a big Clancy fan, I was disappointed that this book wasn't up to snuff. But I think some of the reviewers have been unnecessarily harsh. It's still a good read. Just not as good as his earlier stuff."
1,It's just sad,"I, like most of the other readers, was extremely disappointed in this latest Clancy effort. The dialogue was horrible - who talks like that?, the nicknames of the twins seemed to be tacked on later, and the references to Grace Kelly, Maureen O'Hara, and Humphrey Bogart were just strange. There were too many unrealistic moments to even begin to mention them all (They'd never seen a Ferrari dealership before? - A son of a former President being able to slip into Vienna? This is the last Clancy book that I'll ever read - I'm donating it to the library."
5,Exciting new route for the Ryan family,"After the past few books by Mr. Clancy, it is nice to see a logical extension of the Ryan family getting involved in the ""family business"". It seems as though Jr. is getting involved in much the same way as his father was.An exciting story from start to finish. A little shorter than the normal Clancy novel.I look forward to the next in this series of books to involve Jack Jr."
3,Long...,Good story. Long in places. Though the ending hangs it does not entice me to get the next one.
2,"Good R&D, slow, monotonous execution","Clancy's claim to fame is the excellent research he does to give his books that extra sense of reality. In this one, the research was there, the concept seemed plausible and the book was real enough, but the topic of the research was just too mundane to make a good novel. After the first few chapters, in which there is a disturbing but convincing abduction and murder, the book just rambles....and rambles....and rambles...almost until the last few chapters. Frequent references to prior works and what appears to be an effort to build up new characters for future books adds to the monotony. On the positive side, I could find no major flaws in the character development, plot or technical aspects of the book....Mont Blanc tunnel not withstanding. I haven't read a Clancy novel in a while and, although this wasn't a bad read, it could have been better."
2,half a book,"To me, this was not a typical Clancy book. It seemed light while reading it without as much substance as one of his earlier thrillers. It seemed like the first 3/4 of the book was spent developing the characters and then he just decided to end it quickly, leaving the story only partially finished."
2,A tired attempt,"Jack Ryan's son and his two cousins (ex-FBI and ex-Marine) join ""the Campus"" as its first analyst and hitmen. The campus is a privately funded entity with deep tentacles into CIA, NSA, and FBI. With its ""trading company"" profits it does what the agencies cannot -- basically, kill bad guys. Here, a rogue terrorist outfit launches a group of four attacks on U.S. shopping malls (can they be all bad?), at one of which all the baddies are killed by the two cousins. Ryan's son analyzes internet traffic and the two cousins are sent to hit four operations guys which they do successfully, using injected succinylcholine. Lots of action and atmosphere and a decent introduction of the characters, but after the first third of the book not much danger or challenge for the protagonists. You might want to read a free copy."
3,A platform for future books....,"All this book is doing is setting the stage for future books. Not a lot of action at all, it just introduces 3 new characters...I would have expected this to be one of his OP-Center books actually....definitely not his usual writings."
3,A Different Clancy,"Very, very easy read. Much different than your usual Tom Clancy novels. I enjoyed reading it, but could not help feeling like this book was pushed out there given the current atmosphere of terrorism and what our country can do to prevent it.There are no surprises here, no plot twists - pretty much you know the outcome very early. I would have liked to have seen more detail as Clancy usually provides, more inside-information and plot twists as well.Overall an enjoyable read; don't have to think, just go with the flow."
3,The Teeth of the Tiger,"I have liked all the Tom Clancey books, including this one. However, staying up last night I was very disappointed with the ending - there was none! This book seems like it was not completed and it should have stated continued in my next book. If this had been my first Tom Clancey, I probably would not look for another."
1,Boring,I read or I should say that I tried to read Red Rabbit before putting it aside... This latest book by Tom Clancy has all the same qualities as Red Rabbit! It's time for Clancy to hang it up and do something productive and quit using his past reputation to go on being considered an author.This book is slow and boring. There's little reason to continue on with it unless I feel like a nap!Please if someone else managed to get to the last page tell me that it actually developes into something worth reading! Otherwise I'll put it alongside of Red Rabbit for sleep time!
1,Toothless Tiger,"I've read all of Clancy's books and this is by far the worst - pure garbage and a waste of time to read. The characters are unbelievable, the plot is unimaginative and easy to anticipate, and the open-ended finish is lame.... I mean come on - two untrained twins let loose by a ""private"" vigilante group to hunt down and kill suspected terrorists - all the while flying 1st class, driving the finest cars, staying in five-star hotels and planning / discussing their ""hits"" at sidewalk cafes. It's James Bond meets Maxwell Smart. I'm sure the real Jack Ryan is turning over in his literary grave. Don't waste your time or money on this one....."
1,Pretty disappointing,Can Tom Clancy please ditch the moralising and political statements- all I ask from him is an exciing read! Things have gone downhill steadily since Executive Orders.
2,Clancy is getting rusty.,"I have been anxiously waiting to get Clancy's take on the post 9-11 world of terrorism, geopolitics, and a realistic fantasy about the inner workings on the current military favoring administration and political climate. What I was hoping for was an amazing and timely combination of ruthless action (Without Remorse), behind the scenes political intrigue (The Dragon and the Bear), uncanny technical expertise and description (The Hunt for Red October), black ops (Clear and Present Danger), terror-realism (The Sum of All Fears), and a [great] assault on terrorists (Rainbow Six). What Clancy delivers in this 'token' novel is a watered down fraction of the great work he has done in the past. This book has a few exciting and interesting moments, but they aren't worth the long stretches of hollow dialog, shallow and predictible plot lines, and overly right-wing editorial and military pandering...."
2,Abysmal,"10 pages from the end I was not sure if I would bother finishing this book. This is in sharp contrast to early Clancy novels where, even if I found the conclusions ""unlikely"", I enjoyed them and cared enough to find out how the story ended. I'm not sure what more to say. The characters are glaringly two-dimensional (both the good and the bad), Clancy remains a sermonizing narrator (distractingly preaching through the mouth of every character) and the book ultimately seems to be a weak attempt at ""Without Remorse II"". Might make an acceptable loaned book, but save your money (I wish I had)."
2,Clancy rip-off,"Don't pay full price for half a book. This is barely 400 pages, and those padded by wide spaces between the lines. The book looks like it was written for the screen, with a simpler plot than the typical Clancy and an obvious setup for a sequel."
3,The Tiger Bites Back,"New heroes - the son of Jack Ryan and his nephews, are introduced as part of a super-secret quasi-governmental organization. They fight the new enemies - the muslim terrorist organizations, who hate and attack the US. In fighting them, our heroes attack the enemy before the enemy attacks the US. I rated this book average because the descriptions of world politics and the use of advanced technology were not as crisp nor as involved as in previous novels. Also, the morally conflicting code of pre-emptive assasination was not satisfactorily resolved."
1,What a disappointment! Avoid.,"This was awful. I say this with remorse since the first several Tom Clancy novels (Hunt for Red October, Red Storm Rising, Clear and Present Danger) were some of my favorite popular fiction books. In the current novel, young Jack Jr. mentions his Dad in almost every other scene. We keep getting tidbits that refer to elements of previous novels in the Jack Ryan series. Blah, I want a fun book that stand on its own. We do not see a lucid discussion of technology in current day problems. We do not see taught fast paced action. The plot is linear and straight forward and the conclusion is nothing but an ad for the next book, which will certinaly become the first Clancy novel that I haven't purchased when it was releaseed. Most likely, I will wait to check it out from my local library. Hopefully for his next book, Tom Clancy will invent a new series or fill in some elements of his current cast of characters at earlier times."
1,Disappointing!,"I'm a big fan of Tom Clancy but this new novel is so bad compared to all the other ""Jack Ryan"" novels that I don't know what to say. The plot is thin, unrealistic and predictable; the characters have no depth at all. To buy this book is a waste of good money."
4,Did they ask him to split it in half?,"The ending really feels like they put a wall in there - it feels like he wrote a book twice this size, and they wanted him to get more money by selling two books rather than one! There's no real ""wrap-up"" to the ending, like in his other books (Debt of Honor excepted to a point...)Other than that, it's finally starting to get back to the Clancy we all know from PG, HfRO, CaPD, etc.."
1,"Not worth the time, money, or effort...","Clancy's writing was never Nobel-level, but his editor seems to have taken a vaction. His latest novel is filled with terrible puns, repetitious and sometimes out of place jargon and over-eager nicknames that make reading this book a chore. The action, when it finally happens, drags, and the explanations that take up most of the book are insular and implausible. This is definitely not one of his better books, regardless of the fictitious name-dropping his characters do throughout the novel. Readers would have been better off without another addition to the Ryan saga, as this one doesn't take the story anywhere at all."
1,The worst written Book I ever read.,"Tom Clancy has kept waiting for suspense for the whole book. I still have not finished it. But I have read enough to tell you that he needs more time off. I don't know why he removed his key character's, (Jack Ryan Sr. and my favorite John Kelly a.k.a. John Clark.) I have loved every book he his in. I you want true Tom Clancy read Rainbow Six or Without Remorse. They are his key works of art. His latest book makes me want to read to 8 yr. old brother from Peter Pan.Don't get me wrong I love Peter Pan But he's not Clancy and neither was this book."
3,Roger that.,"Having read all of Clancy's novels with the exception of Red Rabbit, I would have to put this one in the lower half of his work. The editing seems a bit lax (somehow Sacramento became Provo) and Clancy's own research was flawed in two places: The direction of Mecca from anywhere in the eastern USA would be to the North East (not the South East)... think Great Circle. Later, hw wrote that there are 42 suras in the Qur'an when there are in fact 114. This is quite unlike him. I also felt the dialog became a bit much ""Roger that."". I think the new direction is a good thing, but perhaps having all three characters related is a bit odd."
2,I finished it but I don't know why!,"Clancey can do better than this. I think he is cashing in on his name rather than writing a good book for himself. It was slow, actually boring and very predicatble. It almost was a bad screen play waiting of a movie contract. Just don't bother reading it. I recommend rereading an earlier book rather than waste your time & money"
1,Words fail to convey how bad this book is,"Hving enjoyed most of Tom's books in the past I was absolutely appalled by this books content or perhaps it would be better to say lack of content. The plot is tranparent, the characters superficial, the content unbelievable and the flow from section to section choppy and chaotic. I gave Mr. Clancy a pass on Rabbitt thinking it an exception to his other great books. Now it seems clear the well is dry from producing too many books too quickly. Tom take you time and find the old magic. Readers, save your money. Check it our at the library if your feel you must."
3,"Not his best, but still entertaining","Though it doesn't measure up to Tom Clancy's best, this is an easy, entertaining read that moves quickly and never lacks excitement. If you are looking for a realistic look at covert operations or are expecting another one of Clancy's masterpieces, you will probably be disappointed. But if you're looking to give your mind a break via an escape into a fast-moving action story pertaining to today's terrorist threat, this is a good choice."
2,Better off as a Short Story,"A thought provoking book with a good story line. This would have made for a better 30 page short story than a full book. For us Clancy fans, this book is a huge disappointment."
2,Worst Clancy book ever.,"I had the same problems with this book that many other reviewers did. But my biggest issue with this book was the overlap of the real world and the Jack Ryan world. Jack Jr talks about the increase in airport security since 9-11 and one of the Caruso brothers is fighting in Afghanistan. In the Jack Ryan world Denver was nuked, a jet was crashed into the capital, and terrorists released Ebola in the US. There was no 9-11 attack in the Jack Ryan world."
2,Tom Clancy's Death Rattle,"Shockingly weak Clancy novel that I wish I'd never read...""Rainbow Six"" is an exponentially better read that leaves you with an actual feeling of satisfaction when it's over. Come to think of it, ALL of the Jack Ryan novels blow this one away.Don't let this book drop your opinion of Clancy by an extraordinary amount...a must-skip for any Jack Ryan fan."
2,"Honor, country, sacrifice - again!!!","I picked up this book from my public library - the fact that it was readily available gave me an indication of its popularity or lack thereof. It is classic Clancy with all the typical 'God bless the USA', boyscout dialogues peppered all through the book.Mr. Clancy is quite good at describing situations, but building characters has never been his strong suit. I cringe everytime his characters spout moral and ethical cliches every two minutes. I mean, who talks like that in everyday life? We all love our country but dont intersperse our daily conversations with words of honor, country, patriotism and the like.Clancy is still good at describing the dark world of black-ops and espionage - my suggestion is that he needs to stick to writing about situations and technical detals and hire someone to build his characters for him."
2,Not his best,"Having read all of Clancy's books over the years I must say this was quite a disappointment. I generally accept that Mr. Clancy takes his time in setting up the main story (ex: Rainbow 6), but this was painful. In the end I'm glad I finished the book, but wouldn't recommend it."
1,Toothless Tiger,"Like all of Clancy's books, this one is dull, and predictable. He puts so much time into his research(though I truly doubt it on this one!) that he forgets he is writing a thriller to entertain his readers. When he started getting paid per word, his quality of writing took a nose dive, to the point where his stories are formulaic, and unimaginative.Read instead; Larry Bond's1. Red Pheonix(2nd Korean War)2. Vortex(South Africa)3. Cauldron(Turmoil in Western Europe)David Hagberg's ""By Dawn's Early Light"" and ""Kilo Option(written under the name of Sean Flannery)Grant Blackwood's ""Wall of Night""All of the novels listed above are far Superior to ANYTHING authored by Clancy since his ""RED STORM RISING""(co-authored with Larry Bond).Each of these novelists could teach Clancy a lot about writing Techno-THRILLERS."
1,Really... can I have my money back?,"Before your read this, consider that ""zero-stars"" was not an option.The review is something like this ""1.- islamic terrorists kill innocent civilians. 2.- A private organization hires the son of former president Ryan, and his cousins, to avenge those civilians. 3.- The 3 cousins kill 4 or 5 arabs. That is ALL"" ... wow, and now, can I have my money back.The book has no plot att all, and no end. Isn't a Thriller suposed to be Thrilled?Is now the USA hiring assassins to retailiate?By the way, Is Clancy promoting fascism as the ideal for the USA? The book could've been writen in nazi Germany... only that ""Mein Kampff"" was, at least, realistic."
1,The Teeth of Boredom,"I received this book as a gift and was looking forward to a good read only to discover that this is certainly the worst Tom Clancy book I have read. The dialogue is amateurish and unrealistic. Very little happens for more than half the book. The ending is slapdash and unsatisfying. The door is open for another book to continue and resolve the plot line, but there is no chance I will bother reading the next installment. Don't waste your time with this one."
2,where's the old Tom Clancy?,"I'm a big Tom Clancy fan but have been VERY disappointed in his last couple of books. I thought I'd give him another try with this book since it said ""a new generation takes over"" and my biggest problem with his more recent books is the characters' stories had already been told. I'm about halfway through this book and still forcing myself along. Frankly, I don't find Jack Ryan, Jr. particularly interesting and I feel like ""I'll keep reading and maybe finally something will happen."" I'm sad to say that there will be no more Tom Clancy purchases by me."
3,Below Par,"I have been a long time reader of Tom Clancy fiction. I anxiously awaited the release of this, his latest work. This book does not come close to The Bear and the Dragon. While Teeth of the Tiger keeps you interested it never seems to go anywhere and it has no real climax. Sorry, Tom, this one does not measure up."
3,Not A Good Performance,"""The Teeth of the Tiger"" - Tom Clancy on a bad day. The book was not typical Tom Clancy and generally an unsatisfactory read. I imagine that had Mr. Clancy combined this book with possibly his next two one would have come away with a feeling of fullfillment."
2,Toothless Tiger,"Many Clancy fans will be disappointed by this book, one that lacks the kind of research, detail and texture that has put the author at the head of his class. The focus of the book, and it seems others to come, is young Jack Ryan, Jr., who joins a secret off-the-books agency charged with eliminating America's enemies. Unlike his father, who faced unforseen challenges in a heroic way, young Ryan is a self-assured, name-dropping child of privilege and entitlement, and, frankly, not all that endearing. (Young Ryan is also conveniently closer in age to Ben Afflek, who has taken over the Jack Ryan movie role from Harrison Ford). The bad guys are run-of-the-mill Middle East terrorists, necessarily evil and, worse, boring.""Tiger"" is shorter than the usual Clancy thriller. At 431 pages, this one is bloated with the author's usual digressions and off-handed opinions, some of which are occasionally relevant and interesting. As a long-time Clancy fan, I expected more."
2,Very average,Better than the co-authored Clancy books but a poor attempt to recreate the character of Jack Ryan in the form of his son. The majority of the book labours over building a plot and characters before a weak and anticlimactic finish.Come on Mr Clancy where's that sparkle?
2,"OK, it's short","At 431 pages it's almost a novelette for Tom Clancy, but it's quite a tedious one. It's like watching newsreel footage of Howard Hughes' Spruce Goose - this great lumbering beast of a machine flying just above the surface of the water, never taking off, going nowhere but into mothballs.The dialogue is apparently structured from macros left over on Tom's laptop from previous books, and the characters' internal dialogues are so inane they make your hair hurt.I would have given it one star but it's not as bad as Red Rabbit."
3,Shallow characters ruined it,"I was a huge fan of Tom Clancy years ago but he seems to keep getting worse... In Teeth of the Tiger, the character development is terrible and the non-technical dialog is painful to read.While Clancy still is very good at the analysis and technical stuff, he can't seem to write an intriguing character anymore, they all just seem to come from a formula... I'm beginning to think that once he started working with ghost writers (with the Net-Force and Op-Center books which are awful) he tried to formalize his method and now he follows that formula for his own books.If you haven't read much Clancy, start with his first book and work forward, stop when you start getting annoyed (which started at Debt of Honor for me)."
4,"Not Clancy's Best, But Still Fun","This isn't in the same class with ""The Hunt for Red October"", but it is still a fun read. As usual Clancy comes up with a plausible threat and builds a story around fallible antagonists pitted against fallible protagonists who we know will prevail in the end."
2,Not up to Clancy standards,"I was not only sorely disappointed, I found it hard to believe that Clancy wrote it. Although one of his shorter books, it really dragged. There were a couple of great action moments, but the ending almost makes you forget them. I found myself swearing at the heroes for being so stupid and at the end saying..""huh? That's it?"" The book had a good concept and a good plot,but Clancy didn't carry through. The ending is unbelievable and unfinished. Very unsatisfying. If I hadn't read so many great Clancy novels, I'm not sure I'd read another."
2,"Good Beginnning, poor ending",This book started out with new characters and new ideas and I found it intriguing and well paced -- however the last one hundred pages dragged on and on with a very predictable outcome -- how many people do we need to kill in the same way to get the point (no pun intended for those who have read the book) that the pen works! I think I may have bought my last Clancy book!
2,Very disappointing - only half a book,"Teeth of the tiger disappointed me on several fronts. The most aggregious offence is the ending - it's only half a book. It stops in midstream without ending and with nothing resolved, without even much of a climax. So you'll be forced to buy the sequel which may finish the story.I also found it lame that Clancy chooses to introduce Jack Ryan's son plus two of his cousins as the heros. Not only have we never heard of these guys before in any other clancy books, it's just too implausible.Finally, the plot is so much narrower than his first several really big books with really big ideas. The terrorists aren't really that bad - just stupid. The idea that the agency would randomly send a brand new analyst who also happens to be the presidents son into harm's way is ridiculous.This one feels more like the op center paperback series than the traditional clancy works, and all in all I was very disappointed."
1,Toothless Tiger,"If you are a Clancy fan, keep walking past this one. The book is only half the size of his previous Jack Ryan works with only 1/10 of the story. The next generation of Ryan(s)heros are just too perfect to be believed or to be admired. Halfway through the book you will have guessed the ending or be hoping that the ""heroes"" get eliminated. Very formula, very disappointing."
2,What happened to this book?,"The first thing any fan will notice is that this book doesn't have the heft one has come to expect from Mr. Clancy. At 425 odd pages it is half the size of Clancy's flagship works.Evidently Clancy is using this book as a vehicle to set up a new cast of characters, but beyond some marginal character development, there isn't much going on. Like everything he touches, this book is eminently readable. However I consider it a far cry from his better work.After reading the book I really wonder if there isn't a sequel scheduled for release soon, as the book honestly seems to end midstride, accomplishing nothing but laying the ground work for some larger plot."
2,Clancy Bomb,"Being a big Tom Clancy fan even with the last couple of books being somehat below par I bought this as soon as it hit the stands. First thing I noticed it was somewhat thin in page count but immediately cracked the cover and was soon beginning to realize that was going to be a big disappointment. Besides bringing in totally new characters all at once, the plot is very thin, non tech (unlike Clancy) and just a run of the mill jar head and cop going around Europe killing terrorist with no more prep than a 15 year old going out on Friday night. Save your money and pray that TC puts some real effort into his next one."
1,Clancy lite - very lite,"A major disappointment for a big fan. It's short, simple, thinly plotted, has almost no character development, is barely believable and sets up so obviously for a sequel that you want to throw the book across the room when you finish it. It's the weakest sole effort to date. Reread any of his earlier work instead, it will be much more rewarding."
3,Assassinations,"Another Spy novel by Tom Clancy full of international intrigue and suspense. It provides insight to the process of intelligence gathering and covert operations. The author's attempt to justify assassinations in violation of law came through to this reader as having a political agenda. The story is well written, however it is not one of his best works."
1,teeth of the tiger,slow no much action. clancy never finished writting the book. i felt somewhat cheated
1,Eye of the Tiger - Terrible!,"Go to a book store and pick any book at random - it's likely to be an improvement over Eye of the Tiger.This from a Clancy fan - when i saw he was writing under his own name (ie not cowritten), i was looking forward to a good thriller.Instead what you get is terribly bad writing - incredibly repetitive. While most of the Clancy books have a conservative slant, this one seems little more than a platform for Clancy to expand on some very lame and often contradictory political and religious points of view. There is barely any plot to speak of.The characters aer superficial and not well thought out. Worst of all, they are inconsistent and at times donwright moronic. it's as if the book were written for teenagers.This book is so bad you have to wonder if it's the same author that wrote the early blockbusters that made Clancy to so famous."
1,Not ready for prime time,"This book was very disappointing. I had read previous reviews, but my expectations still weren't low enough.The plot was quite simplistic, but the worst things were the naivete and stupidity of the ""heroes."" I can't be more specific without some spoilers, but it's hard to believe this book was written by the same guy who wrote the books in the Jack Ryan set.I recommend giving it a pass. I usually reread Clancy books, but not this one."
2,below average clancy book,"This book is probably average for a regular novel but for a clancy novel it is below average. I have read all of clancy's novels except for 'Red Rabbit' and this is by far the worst. Jack ryan Jr. is annoying and the twins are totally rah-rah military extremists that I hope could never exist in the real world. The characters are boring and the jingoism is extreme. Mr. Clancy- calm the 'America right or wrong' - please and focus more on the plot and character development. Though it is difficult to put out quality work for 20+ years so I can see how TC is having difficulty.I would avoid this book if you are a clancy fan. But it is average for a novel. The novel ends abruptly, overall the novel was a disappointment."
1,Major let down - Avoid without second thought,"Totally agree with the comments of David Rose. I decided to randomly pick a novel by Clancy thinking I could not go wrong. But this book is a complete disaster. The language (choice of words) is cheap, dialogues/thoughts are shallow, and repetitive. The characters and the plot are shallow. The subject matter was of interest and that was the only reason I finished the book. I cannot still belive that an accomplished author can produce such cheap work.You can do better use of your time."
3,Not up to Clancy's usual standard,"I really enjoy Tom Clancy's novels. This one was a bit disappointing, although I understand it's purpose. He introduces several ""new"" characters since he's done about all he can with Jack Ryan. Jack Ryan, Jr. is being groomed to take his father's role.This book had a very weak plot (and too much filler, but that's the norm for Clancy - I can live with that). There was decent character development, but that's about the only positive thing I can say. After reading the last page, my thought was, ""That was it?""Get's 3 stars because I like Tom Clancy and think there can be some good books to follow this one. But Tom was lazy with this one."
2,less than gripping,"I have in the past enjoyed Mr. Clancy's books, but this one was really lacking. The story was weak, and the characters were flat. By the end of the book, I didn't care what happened to these three shallow boys."
2,"Half a Book, Half a Plot","I love Tom Clancy. Rainbow Six is one of all time favorite novels. Executive Orders and The Bear and the Dragon are so huge in scope it boggles the mind. Herein lies the problem with The Teeth of the Tiger.It has an interesting plot, the rise of Jack Ryan Jr. and the partnership between a drug cartel and a terrorist group. However, at just over 400 pages or some 700 pages shorter than most other Clancy novels, it never really takes off. The terrorist attack in this book seems minor when compared to the bio-attack from Executive Orders, or a plane crashing into the capital from Without Remorse, and a nuke heading toward the US from The Bear and the Dragon, and a virus capable of killing everyone on the planet or any number of terrorist attacks from Rainbow Six. Lots of things are left hanging in this book (so what happens to the cartel, who is heading up the Organization). I hear Tom is taking a break to play golf, I hope he finally finishes this book we he returns."
1,Writer gets comfortable...too comfortable opportunities abound for me,"I was dissapointed with this reading for all the reasons listed by the other critics. The attempts to characterize Enzo, dominic, and ryan were superficial and wordy. I wont attempt to go in any more detail because the plot was going somewhere but the ride was not what i expected.I read it with the idea of studying tom clancy's novel with the idea of writing my own draft. face it's no different than life, it may go somewhere or not."
2,A bad fall,"This looks like the ""OpCenter"" novels -- short, dumb, and a far cry from previous Clancy's books. The plot is flimsy, the heroes (all family) do away with all enemies without any problems, and a bad guy is left over (a Bond-esque Blofeld) for further novels... I'm not certain whether I'll read the next novel."
2,Clancy slippage,"I have all of Clancy's books and have been a fan since his first, the genre classic ""Hunt for Red October."" He hit a peak with ""The Bear and the Dragon,"" and his works since ""Bear"" have shown a slow decline in quality. ""Teeth of the Tiger"" is almost a caricature of a Clancy novel. His development of the one-dimensional characters is heavy-handed and even his description of action sequences--long a Clancy strong suit--is lacking the force and eloquence of his previous work.I'm currently re-reading ""Red Storm Rising."" The distinction between the quality of that earlier work and ""Teeth"" is striking. As a Clancy fan, I come not to bury him but to praise him--his earlier work, at least--and hope that he can return to that level of writing in the future."
1,When successful writers become greedy,"The one plot development that might have saved this mess is if Ryan senior had got wind of what ""The Campus"" and Hanley were doing and outed the whole operation as undemocratic and unsupported by him, proving the pardons to be forgeries. As it is, Clancy shows he has no respect for his readers by allowing this woeful, unlikely storyline to go to print. Due to the lack of editing I feel it has been written and published hastily to fulfil a contractual obligation. Clancy deserves the poor reviews he has received, not only for the poor character development (typical of Clancy) and plodding writing (which some editing would have sharpened), but in one scene he has been so careless as to change a character's name (Wills/Woods). Does Clancy really believe his readers to be so gullible and still buy more. I don't think so..."
1,Not Clancy worty material,"I found this book to be totally sub-par when it came to Tom Clancy's writing. I've been following the ""Ryanverse"" since I was a kid and I've always found it to lend itself readily to interesting stories. The characters were annoyingly flat with the exception of Jack Jr., who, by many definitions, seems to be a little socio/psychopathic near the end of the book. It's rather annoying and I was left disappointed overall."
1,the teeth of the tiger by tome clancy,"A predictable, simplistic, repetitious book. It features three cardboard heroes who continually discuss similar issues and subject matter in wooden, pretentious, unconvincing dialogue. The book had potential but Clancy needed some serious editing advice to make it more successful. The novel ends unsatisfyingly. The ""revenge"" theme of the novel is only partially completed and there are a lot more ""bad guys"" to eliminate in some potential sequal. The sequel should be better than this novel, now that all of the setting up of plot and ""characters"" has been made in this installment.I am usually a Tom Clancy fan and think that this had a lot of potential but it needed some serious editorial help and honest criticism. I thought that the ""teeth of the Tifer "" referenced the thinking of DeMille in the ""Lion's Game"" , a much better book dealing with terrorist thinking and motivations."
1,Pass it by...,"It's time for Mr. Clancy to hang it up. With a story line as unbelievable as this, he surely must have better things to do. The book starts off with a bang and ends up with a whimper. As a female reader of thrillers, espionage and spy novels I found the three main characters of this book, Ryan, and the Caruso twins, to be spectacularly shallow and uninteresting. Are we really to believe that it's this easy to recruit nice young men to be assassins? If so, we are in big trouble. Clancy's use of language such as ""the bad guys"" and ""pukes"" reminds me of something I would have read in high school. I must remember when his next novel appears, probably a sequel to this one since he very slyly left that door open, to just pass it by!!"
1,The Teeth of the Tiger,"This book is best described as Clancy-lite. Whatever happened to the man who wrote such excellent books as Executive Orders and Debt of Honor? This book is tedious and predictable with characters that may as well be cardboard cutouts. The character of Jack Jr. is especially weak. And while I agree with many of the sentiments expressed in the book, such as handcuffing intelligence agencies and then criticizing them for not being effective, the book comes across as overly preachy. There also seemed to be a lack of proper editing, since information conveyed in one chapter was often repeated in another as if it were being offered for the first time."
1,"Terrible effort, awful book, Death rattle of Clancy?","Anger has forced me to write a review of this terrible book. Clancy gets the benefit of the doubt from most of his fans and he has abused that privledge here. Where is the research and story telling, where is the common sense? Or how about just an ending?!?! Why was the mossad guy killed?? What the hell happened with the Columbians? Where did Jr tell mom and dad he was working? Why is the most ""black"" ops operation ever using 2 guys with zero experience. When did the Mont Blanc tunnel connect France to Switzerland and not Italy?Reading the twins dialogue was like lstening to N' sync interviewed on MTV, terrible. WTF!Worst part is I was stuck in a Mexican airport and paid $12 for the paperback. Go re-read Red Storm Rising"
2,DON'T BOTHER,"Like several of his most recent books,""Teeth of the Tiger"" is a great disappointment.There are several fundamental things wrong with it.First,and most important,there is not enough of a storyhere for an entire novel.(At most,it might be enough for the pilotepisode of a TV series.)Second,like other recent Clancy novels,itis SLOW.There is no significant action until about page 240.He uses more than half the book to develop his characters,but thatleads to the third major problem.His characters are not credible.I have had occasion to know a number of people who are in roughlythe same line of work as Clancy's heroes. They don't talk likeClancy's characters.Clancy's characters are caricatures.They arenot real.Even worse,they are not interesting.That is the problemwith the whole book:It is not interesting.Clancy seems to have lost his knack for storytelling.It's a shame."
2,Disappointing,"I cannot decide whether to read all the way to the end or cut my losses with 100 pages to go. The book is cutesy. It is full of jargon. The characters are ridiculous and unflawed. At least Jack Ryan Sr has a bit of a drinking problem and some stock market ethical issues. Jack Jr seems to be a combination of Richie Rich, Superboy and Jesus. If, like me, you have some irresistable urge to read Clancy's books no matter what, this might be a good time to borrow a friend's or go to the library. That said, Robert Ludlum's last couple were pretty good, so sometimes it pays off to endure a 15 year lousy streak...I'd say we're about 6 years into this one..."
1,Is Clancy loosing his magic touch?,"This is a very weak thriller, without a good argument.The story does not hold properly together.Tom Clancy must be loosing his touch.It would be better if he could stop for a while to preparare of of manificent stories of the past, but he should not write again such an uninteresting book."
1,Predictable and Disappointing,"Had this been my first Clancy novel it most certainly would have been my last. I've read and enjoyed all his previous work and looked forward to this one as well.Instead I found it predictable, shallow on detail, short on intrigue and just short in general.Lets hope his next work is up to par with the previous work,"
2,Less Filling for Me -- Might Taste Great to You,"This is clearly not the typical Clancy meganovel. It's better to think of this as Clancy-lite, a less filling approach to story telling. Much less time is spent on character development, plot development, and overall detail. I missed that. I missed following multiple plot threads, trying to anticipate how they'd ultimately be woven together. I missed knowing as much about each character as I had in past books. I can see how others will appreciate how streamlined this story is, but that's not what I look for in a book, and it left me wanting much more.The ending of the book was also very unsatisfying to me. I expected to see a ""To Be Continued. . ."" at the end of the book. It might has well have been put there for everyone to see, because everyone who reads this book is going to be looking for it."
1,"Boy, what a dissappointment...","It's hard to believe that somebody as talented as Tom Clancy with so many excellent works to his credit can put out the mindless drivel that is The Teeth of the Tiger. Instead of the rich complexity of his earlier books, and all the research and technical detail that made him famous, a reader will find nothing but a simplistic plot and uninteresting, one-dimensional characters who engage in the most ridiculous dialogue I've read in a long time (seriously, who talks like that?). Two things that you would think he would know to include in a good novel: a climax, and a decent ending. None of that here. The story simply lacks imagination, and seems as if it was written with no other intention than to make a quick buck. I am just glad I bought this book used and in paperback."
1,"""The sun rose promptly at dawn.""","That sentence begins chapter 8, page 184 in my edition. The fact that I paid money for such drivel reflects poorly on my judgement. Perhaps I was hoping that Mr. Clancy had returned to early form and/or used a competent editor. Alas, I was only deluding myself. Like an aging boxer, past his prime and just trying to earn a paycheck based on past glory, Mr. Clancy's recent work leaves me sad and a little ashamed of myself for watching. No mas, please, no mas."
1,Each one worse than the one before,"I'm stunned. I've been a Clancy fan from the beginning, and while each book has been less entrancing than the one before, this hits bottom. No drama. Superficial characters. No suspense. No plot to speak of.This should never have been published. It's clear its only purpose was to set the stage for future books using Jack Ryan's son and cousins as the new main characters.We know that the ""Clancy machine"" has been churning out materials to capitalize on the name, the Net-force series, for example. But we could count of his ""real"" books to be good reads. No more.I'd like the time back that I spent on this book. It's only redeeming trait? It has to be one of the worst ""thrillers"" ever written and published.Shame on you, Tom."
2,Teeth of the Tiger,"A great disappointment - the early Clancy books were excellent, but this was corny, badly written, rambling, you wonder if one of his many ""collaborators"" actually wrote it, and Clancy put his name on it and took the big check. Will definitely think twice before ordering another Tom Clancy book."
2,Teeth but no tiger,This book tried to capture the essence of the other Ryan novels. But in my opinion fails miserably. To of the main characters are very annoying to read about. The worst Clancy novel to date ..... By far. I don't even think Clancy even wrote it as the writing style seems different. I love All of Clancy's books.... But this one is terrible.
2,Terrible Narrator,"The narrator can't do different voices, forgets the voices of people he's done, and his voice in general is soft and a little girly. Drive me nuts to the extent of not wanting to hear it."
1,Disappointing,"I have been an avid Clancy fan since the beginning and enjoyed his mastery of the language, his ability to run with complex scenarios in a very realistic and spell binding way and I just enjoyed his books. His latest effort I'm afraid, leaves me very underwhelmed. For the first time ever, I became bored with the plot and its lack of depth. It was like he actually wasn't writing it as it bore no similarity to his earlier excellent works. From the ending of this effort, it would seem the next edition will be a continuation of the same - not for me; unless he reverts to doing what he does best (writing masterful suspense) I will be spending my dollars elsewhere and supporting new and upcoming authors who put their heart into their work. Disappointing Mr Clancy, very disappointing."
1,A Clancy Clunker,"This was the worst Clancy book to date. A total bore. I had to talk myself into finishing it. I kept waiting for the plot to thicken and grab me, but, to my total disappointment, it never happened. Poor characters, dreadful dialogue and a totally predictable ending. Clancy is a better author than this book indicates. He needs to do better in the future if he's to keep his many fans. There are so many better writers out there now, not the least of which are Dan Brown, Vince Flynn and Joel Rosenberg."
3,needs a sequel,I'm a long time Clancy fan and liked the book but the ending was too abrupt. 3 maybe 4 stars out of 5. Teeth of the tiger needs a sequel to be a 5!
2,Lack of detail,"I am surprised that a lot of people thought Red Rabbit was boring. Boring yes, when it comes to action but in quality and detail, perfect. Teeth of the Tiger was way to short, cheap and lack of detail. The action was great but just not enough detail. I ve read only three of Clancys books and this was the weakest of them. Definitely not one of Clancys best."
2,sell me a car,I have no interest in buying a new car with a computer. This opening is nothing more than an ad for the benz. Tom is just another barker selling things and that goes for clive as well.
1,Very Disappointing (should be 1/2 star),This is probably Clancy's poorest novel. A disappointing and predictable story. The topic lacks originality and the writing is boderline boring. The action is slow and too many pages (and there are not that many in the book to start with!) are devoted to Mr. Clancy's personal and sometimes questionable opinions on subject matters unrelated to the plot. Save your money.
1,Very Disappointing,The story lacks originality and is very predictable. Too many pages are devoted to Mr Clancy's personal and questionable opinion on matters barely related to the story. It is one of his poorest novel.
4,Take 2 years instead of one,"I had optimism going into this book,maybe he would get over his Red Rabbit fumble. The book has a good story and plot. The shortness of the book doesnt help me. HE says he's taking two years to write his next. So a 800-1000 pg would be nice for his next"
2,Not his best,"This Clancy work is about an illegal anti-terroist organization known as the Campus that is set up under the shadow of our government. The Campus is disguised as a normal buisness, and only a few individuals know of its existance.I haven't read a Clancy book in years but I thought that I would give this one a try and although the concept of the story is very interesting not much else is worth noting in this book. Also, when did Clancy become such a sellout? Every time he describes a product in the book it has a brand name attached to it. ""He grabbed a cup of coffee from his Gevalia coffee maker."" OR ""He was driving down the street in his Mercedes S-Class 240 L"" or whatever. I wonder if he gets compensated for mentioning those products. Nice way to supplement your income. Hopefully Clancy can come up with something good soon."
2,Is the Problem Clancy or his Publisher?,"This can not be the same person who wrote ""Cardinal of the Kremlin"" or EO. Or, if it is, then his publisher is simply trying to get the most revenue possible. The classic Clancy ""How it Works"" detailed description is missing or thin. For example, he details how the main characters handle one group of bad guys, but then provides a 10-20 word resolution of the other groups of bad guys. The REAL Clancy would have given us pages of good description of the other activities. The fuel is present, but there is no spark. It could be that Tom's publisher wanted a short book for business purposes. That's the only reasonable explanation for Tom's failure to create a book even close to his normal standard (except for that ""Rabbit"" thing which really was worse than ""Teeth."")"
2,Starts good but...,"This would probably be a 3 or 3.5 stars on most other authors scale but on a Clancy scale, only a 2. The book starts out good with the story of the terrorists but the character development for the main characters (Jack Jr. and the Caruso brothers) is weak. The story seems hurried and quickly put together and the ""missions"" and how long they take to put together seems half-hazard, the type of stuff usually scene on weekly TV cop shows. The book is short by Clancy standards and this may be one of its faults. Clancy fans are used to high tech, high action, and highly detailed writing that draws them into the story. I read them for the stories but usually feel that I walk away with a better understanding of something, whether it be militarily, politically, or foriegn policy wise. From this book, I walked away with nothing but a question, ""Did Clancy really write this?""Not a good choice for true Clancy fans."
2,"Fun ride, but only half he story","I am a fan of Clancy's novels and have read them all. This one, like many of the others, is a fast read. Like most of his other novels, it deals with a timely subject (the second wave of terrorist attacks on US soil). The characters, most of a new generation, are not too well developed, but they work in the story and no doubt will be around for the next volume.My biggest problem with the book is that I felt like I was reading the first half of his next novel. Too much is unresolved in this book and I feel he should have waited until he had the rest of the story written before he published this. No wonder it didn't get above the radar on many best-seller lists.While still an enjoyable read, I'd suggest you wait for the sequel to come out first and buy them both in paperback."
3,Horrible Ending,"I'm not the biggest fan of Clancy's new material. Sure, Red October and Patriot Games are classics that will never lose their appeal, but the new stuff (Op-Center, etc.) is questionable.I was given Teeth of the Tiger by a friend, and I eagerly started it. Three-quarters of the way through the book (which I liked up to that point), I was convinced that Clancy was once again for me. Then came the ending, or lack thereof. I was waiting for some sort of climax, followed by some sort of ending, of which there was little to none. Sure, there was a murder, committed by one of the main characters, but there was little understanding that the victim was the big target of the book, and moreover, there was little in terms of ending after the fact, in fact, the hit took place on the penultimate page! I'm sure that it will continue in another book, but to see how a series is really written, check out Daniel Silva."
3,"not great, but give it a chance","I have been a Clancy fan since Red Storm Rising and by no means is this his stongest book. The mall scene, while extremely good and made me think of Debt of Honor and 9/11, was also extremely coincedental. Plus, the media would obviously would search for who saved all the good people of Carolina, while you would think the local police would wonder where they went and question more. Also, in the end, why would a straight shooter like Jack, Jr. all of a sudden become so bold/stupid? and how did no one in the restaurant here a thing from the bathroom?The good: The plot is clever enough, just needs tweeking. The action is ok, but too quick. The ending leaves you wanting more, which is good.I would have loved to have the behind the scenes backlash(both White House and media) of the terrorist act played out more, but maybe that is for the next book.Obviously Clancy has lost a step, but he is still better than a lot out there."
3,Could be better----,"I must agree that it could have been better. The main idea of the counter terror was very agreeable to me. I certainly hope that we are doing all that the twins were fictionally doing. Some of the dialog did strike me wrong. ""Bro"" ""Big Rog"" Etc. but I am a senior now and do not really know what 20 year old ""speak"" is. All in all I did enjoy the book, maybe as I look at Clancy and his accomplishments I am stilted toward the fact that he can not write a bad one."
1,Tom Clancy just lost another fan,"All I will say is that I will now check Tom Clancy books out of the local public library...........maybe.I was a Tom Clancy junkie and was extremely disappointed with Red Rabbit. I saw this book in the bookstore, saw Tom Clancy's name on the book, and saw the words ""Jack Ryan"" on the dust cover. After I got the book home, I found out that the book was about Jack Jr.I will not say anything more than that I am disappointed again and will NOT anxiously await any other book from Tom Clancy."
1,Clancy's descent continues,"What a dreadful book. After ""Red Rabbit"" I thought it couldn't get any worse. I was wrong.One dimensional characters, plot holes you could drive a bus through, knee-jerk politics and terrible, terrible writing.Clancy should call it a day before his reputation as a craftsman of the novel is buried under such turgid nonsense as this."
1,I didn't make it through,"I am different than a lot of folks. I value my time. If a movie isn't appealing to me, I walk out. If a book doesn't do something to keep me interested within the first 100 pages I will pass it on. Although I haven't read all of Mr. Clancy's books, I do consider myself a fan. This was the first Clancy novel that I put down.So, just what happened in that first 100 pages? Nothing. It was purely character development, but it was boring development of boring, very fictitious characters. Oh well, when the next one comes out I will be looking forward to reading another excellent page turner. I am sure this won't happen again."
2,Not worth the effort,"It's much better than Red Rabbit, but it's still sub-par. There's nothing new or inventive about it. He's moved on to ""Jack Ryan, the Next Generation"". 3 of Jack's family members all end up working for the same covert agency at about the same time, and the coincidences that bring them to the heart of the action every few pages are annoying. The chosen method of assasination almost stopped me from yawning, but not quite.Red Rabbit was offensively bad. This one's at least readable. The end of the book alludes to the next book, ""Brains of the Tiger"" which would be an absurd title, so I hope he change his mind.I've read a lot of Clancy books, but not all of them. The Sum of All Fears is probably the best fictional book I've ever read. The last few have been getting weak (just above Red Rabbit is Rainbow Six). I'm reading Clear and Present Danger now, and it reminds me of what could've been. It's not Sum of All Fears, but it's still very good."
1,Absolutely Horrid!,"If this were the first Tom Clancy book that I purchased, it would be the last!Having read just about all that Clancy has written, I ordered an advance copy of this book without any fore-knowledge. I had a couple of long plane trips ahead of me and ""knew"" that Clancy would keep me pleasantly engaged.Hah! Instead of the detailed suspenseful novels of his past, The Teeth of the Tiger was skimpy on details, predictable and flat. The characters were one-dimensional, totally boring and unsympathetic - Jack Jr. constantly referred to his father and mother, but never were these characters re-introduced.The hokey-ness of a rookie ""secret"" vigilante team coincidentally consisting only of the former president's son and his twins cousins is too much!This book is half the pages of most of Clancy's previous works and sadly appears to be a quick cash-in on the terrorists-aware times in which we are living. I smell a movie deal! Boo! Hiss!"
3,How Trite,"So now we have a novel from Tom Clancy which is so obviously directed at the latest crop of Hollywood's finest(teen throb division.) I gave this book three stars because it is, after all, a Clancy book and one can hope for better in the future. Of course, following Red Rabbit and most of the direct to paperback Op Center and Net Force novellas you gotta worry a little.The ending is so contrived you know that it was written to ""encourage"" the purchase of the certain follow up book. I think that Tom Clancy has one more chance to remain on my list of ""buy the hardback"" authors. Come on, Tom... publish better or perish"
1,Worst. Book. Ever.,"This book was absolutely painful to read.- Characters are insufferable and completely lacking in appeal. Jack Ryan Jr comes across as a spoiled rich kid who in reality we all want to see go down in privileged flames.- If you want a plot as believable as this one, watch an X-Men cartoon.- Book ends with no warning, no conclusion, no satisfaction. It. Just. Ends.I'm going to wait and read the reviews of the rest of you suckers before risking another TC book purchase. This book was complete garbage."
1,"Half length, half story, half quality -- full price","You're gonna want to avoid this one.I won't belabor the point, but here are a couple things you should know: First of all, at 431 pages, it's the shortest Clancy ever, and less than half as long as some of the good ones.Second, it's HALF A STORY. Without spoiling things, there is no resolution at the end of the book. It ends mid-story, speculating on things that are going to happen next. I'd call it a cliffhanger, but it's not exciting enough to justify use of the term.Third, it's not that good. It's hard to believe the same person wrote this as wrote earlier books. The reviewer who complained about too many astonishing coicidences is exactly right. The writing is clunky, and ""Clancy"" uses the same metaphors and imagery over, and over, and over again.I think Clancy fans ought to be content with the Jack Ryan (Sr.) and John Clark series. They were great. This new stuff is terrible."
2,No good,"Although the product arrived on time, there were many pages ripped out of the beginning of the book; it is in poor condition, unlike what the description said."
2,NOT A FAN.,"This was actually the first time I read Clancy. I honestly can not criticize him as a writer per say. I think its just that I don't like what he is writing about. I did not care for the movie The Hunt For Red October. I am not real big on war movies and military crap like that.With that being said, this book was a hard read, rather boring for me. Clancy is just not for me!!"
3,English Project,"I was just assigned this book for an English assignment for my 2nd period English class. I havent read all of it yet but the first few chapters i have read, have been exciting and suspensful. So far it is a good book to read and i can't wait to finish it."
1,39-60-103-109-175,".... This miserable book by Clancy the old-in-the-tooth wins 39 Five-Stars, 60 Four-Stars, 103 Three-Stars, 109 Two-Stars and 175 One-Star.Enough said."
5,We want more...,"I was astounded to see that this book only received an average of TWO stars! I thought it was one of Clancy's most cleaver books. I loved his ""moving to the future"". He has always been so ""frighteningly accurate"" in some of his facts and this one is no different. As usual, his plot is thick and twisted and moves at the speed of a space ship on Star Trek. His characters are wonderfully drawn and long remembered. I wondered when he was going to get to Jack, Jr. and I'm so happy that he did. Yes, he has used a similar plot line, but the characters in Tiger are so fresh! I want more!!!Librarian waiting in Texas for more Jack, Jr."
1,not up to par!,"disappointed that this in the ""RYAN"" series could be so lacking and so tedious. i've read all of the ""jack ryan"" series and find that although 'red rabbit' was bad - 'teeth' is worse. perhaps now's a good time to end this series!"
4,"The Teeth of the Tiger or ""Episode 1""","The new Tom Clancy Novel is a filler for the Jack Ryan Series that leaves one guessing but also only half-heartedly delivers the suspense and action one has grown to appreciate in a Tom Clancy Novel. In the story we meet Jack Jr. again as an adult. He dramatically portrays the young man that readers would expect from a Son of Jack and Cathy Ryan. We also meet other family members (His Cousins) who are the embodiment of the Jack Ryan mystique. As the title of my review suggest, this story is obviously ""Episode one"" of the new Jack Ryan Series. As an avid Reader of Tom Clancy, I look forward to more episodes in this obviously well prefaced storyline."
3,"Not the best Clancy Novel, but good","This was not my favorite Clancy novel, but it was still good. I liked it."
2,Not even close to his best!,I am a dedicated Clancy fan I started out on Rainbow Six. Tons of action good character development worth the reading so I've compared all of his ooks to that.Patriot Games-Very Good StoryHunt for Red October- Takes too long to get startedRed Rabbit- Way too long and no actionThe Teeth of the Tiger- Decent but should have been longer to actually finish the story of drug cartels and terrorists. Not just talk about the cartels for 2 pages then leave them.This was an ok book the action that was there was good but not detailed enough.
2,"... and now junior""","Clancy lost all conection with reality. Besides, the book has no argument att all... foun it hard to finish. Jack Ryan ""saved"" the world about what... 8 times? now Jack Jr. becomes the avenging hand of god??? It is an insult to the inteligence community."
1,Disappointed,"While I think there was plenty of plot material here, I got the feeling that too much of the dialogue was nothing more than filler. Does Tom Clancy talk like the characters in his book. Aldo and Enzo sound like throwbacks from some 80's television series. Additionally, young Ryan comes across as a shallow 20s something with more interest in capitalizing on his father's name rather than creating a name for himself. This book was a waste of time."
2,Not his best by far!,"Tom Clancy, a name usually associated with high quality writing, but this book falls short of his usual outstanding works. It's almost as if it's written by someone else. The plot rambles on with very little action, no cohesiveness. It comes off as a book written just to play catch-up to world events. Would have liked to see more in-depth development of the characters instead of the shallowness of the three main (?) players who are totally unbeliveable. 431 pages of boredom. Not recommended at all."
1,I used to love his books - he is now terrible,This book has a very poor plot & very little action. The book spends far to much time dicussing insignificant banter with Jack Jr. This is amaturish at best -...
3,Clancy into murder,"Technically this book is better than some recent efforts from Clancy. It is well edited. The story is pretty exciting. But morally, it is objectionable. President Ryan writes pardons effective in the future for private vigilantes to murder suspected terrorists. Ryan's son and cousins join in. Looks like more books to come in this series."
1,Gives boring a whole new meaning,"This book is unbelievably slow and boring. I struggled through the first one hundred and twenty pages, most of which are dedicated to character development that could have been accomplished in about ten pages. I finally gave up on the book when I could not take anymore. The story line described on the dust cover is what hooked me but it takes forever to get started. Perhaps the book gets better if you stick with it but I could not. This book was entirely unlike other Clancy novels that I have read. It appeared to have been written by a far lesser author. Pass on this one."
2,Clancy's lost it,"Underwhelming. That's really the only word to describe this book. I can't say that I'm tingling with excitement to delve into the world of John Patrick Ryan, Jr, especially when the story seems to have been thrown together in a few days. Three out of the last four Clancy books have been clunkers...hopefully the trend will reverse, but I won't be holding my breath."
1,Come on - who really wrote this?,"It has no teeth, or story for that matter. This is without a doubt Clancy's worst published effort. I've been reading the other reviewer's comments and can only echo their disappointment in the dialogue, and characters. What is truly pitiful is the blatant end pitch to the reader: ""Next they'd meet the brain."" Wow! If you got a brain, you won't waste your time on, ""The Teeth of the Tiger"" or the next book, ""The Brain of the Foolish""."
2,Two Strikes,"I think I'll ""light up my computer"" sit down to some ""coffee and donuts"" and make a ""pile of money"". There - I just wrote a Tom Clancy sentence using phrases you've seen before and will get sick of seeing in his book as well. This book is better than ""Red Rabbit"", but that is not saying much. Tom Clancy had a great premise but seems again to be too busy with Tom Clancy Inc. to write to his standards (a bad Tom Clancy novel is still better than most). The dialogue between the brothers is painful (""Hey bro"" repeated over and over) and they seem to be doing well financially for a Marine and a young FBI agent. NO 23 year old kid talks and acts like Jack Jr. He sounds more like a snotty kid or a 50ish man in his tastes and seems to believe he is smarter than everyone else. Hmmmm, like the author perhaps. Tom gets one more chance with me after this and then I stop contributing to his empire. - Mike"
2,Forced to finish,"I can't add much to what has already been said except that this is the first Clancy book I have read(and have read them all), that sits by the side of my bed and I have to force myself to continue reading it.I am halfway through and I can't seem to find the joy that I experienced when reading other Clancy novels. Has Tom fallen into the trap that so many authors seemed to have done over the years, that the author's name will automatically assure we will gobble it up(and yes I did), but believe me, Tom had better do better next time for I will read reviews before pre-ordering as I have done with most in the past.Wake up Tom, get that masterful mind working once again. You know what we like, you have givem it to us many times before and your too smart not to be able to do it again.I hope this and many of the other reviews get your attention Tom if not you will fall by the wayside like so many others."
1,The teeth of the tiger,"This book is a ridiculously shallow attempt by Clancy to exploit his name and make money. The plot is totally unbelievable and the characters are as thin as the sheets of paper they are written on. This is the last Clancy book I will buy. What a shame that the author that brought us The Hunt for Red October, et al has sunk so low."
1,greatest disapointment possible,"Having almost grown up on Jack Ryan ,I thought it immposible for Clacy to write a a terribly bad book-he has.This not only goes aginst all his previously written creeds but is very badly writtenTaking these -as we are supposed to -as real 'people' Rysan Jnr knows his own father would be ashamed of him.I realise now why Kathy Ryan has declined to appear in this book ( and the previous one)ALSO could somebody tell mr Clancy that his effort to appear COOL and Hip is not achieved by two mindless thugs saying 'BRO ' in every sentence. --Not Hip mr C ,what next Hip Hop.I have eagerly awaited every new Ryan book and ordered them in advance.You will not care but you have lost this reader and made a mockery of everything beforePRINCE RAFAEL (U.K )"
3,"Good, but not great","Overall I enjoyed the story, but at the end, I felt there were too many loose ends and too many convenient circumstances. The heros (Caruso brothers and Jack Ryan's son, whom are cousins) are unbelievably lucky. The action sequences are few, but are satisfying. I suspect one or more sequels are in the works to tie up some of the loose ends. The Publishers Weekly editorial review was right on the money - it's not his strongest novel, but it's a big improvement over Red Rabbit."
2,Very Disappointed,"I'm a huge fan of Tom Clancy and have been since the beginning. I was very disappointed in his latest installment of the Jack Ryan series, which in this case actually features his son Jack, Junior and two cousins. Jack Ryan (Sr.) has played out, so it was good to get some new characters but I found the last 1/3 of the book to be very disappointing and just dumb. He seems to have picked up the John Grisham ""crank them out"" syndrome and this was not at all up to the level of previous novels. I kept reading, thinking that surely it would improve and I'd get to the good part. Alas, the book just sort of ended. I'm not likely to read the next one in this series."
3,"Oh, Tom....","Having read the latest offering from Tom Clancy,I felt let down. He has killed off one of my long-standing favourite characters in a handful of platitudes, pensioned off another with a Medal of Honor,and completely ignored the natural successor to the storyline, in favour of an immature clone of Jack Ryan, aided by two others.Oh, Tom...where is the character development of all these newbies? Without Remorse or clear and Present Danger were much better. And Tom, whatever became of Tim Jackson? Let's hope the rest of the reading public don't feel as disappointed as I do."
2,Unimpressive,This transistion from Dr. Ryan Sr. to Jr. is not up to former Clancy standards. There are even some grammatical mistakes. It all seems like a set up to another series....very disappointing from a really great author.
2,less than gripping,"This is not a very believable tale and the Jack Ryan Jr. character is not very exciting. The plot is thin and predictable. Clancy does a lot of name dropping, with characters from previous books in the Ryan series, but this one just doesn't have much of a story to tell."
3,Not up to his standards,"I was dissapointed by this book. The characters (especially Jack Jr.) are not very sympathetic and the plot seems like a retread of some of the better Clark stories. The ending was not only abrupt but also unsatisfying; it reminded me of the stories that used to be serialized in newspapers, when I read the last page I turned it over looking for the next chapter. All in all I would say get it from the library or wait until it shows up in a used bookstore."
3,"Not his best, but still entertaining.","I've ready all of Clancy's books, with the exception of some of the Net Force titles, and have to say that this was somewhat of an improvement over the Red Rabbit fiasco of last year, but still not on the same level of the golden oldies like Sum of All Fears and (my favorite) Without Remorse.The techno-weaponry overload found in Rainbox Six and other later books seems to have been toned down a bit, and old favorite characters are largely referred to in the book so those that don't appear are not relegated to the 'where are they now' pile.Not a bad book, and certainly better than his previous outing. If I had not known it was Clancy, I would have suspected that this was a young novelists' first stab at being published, and that the book was enjoyable, but the writer needed more experience to polish the craft. Yes, he may have 'mailed this one in' but it was not too bad a read (although somewhat predictable, which is not Clancy-like.)"
1,Disappointed,"It took Clancey over 200 pages just to get book started. The cousins are unatractive rich kids who think they are the ""Hardy Boys"" grown up. The plot is non existent. You know how it's going to end. A total bore"
1,The tiger has no teeth,"What a horroble book! Like many others, I have relished the series from Clancy but this is the worst. It has no character development, and horrible dialog. I was ready to gag after reading ""Roger that, bro."" a million times. The story just seems to be a vehicle for Clancy's desire for vigilante justice."
3,Better than the Last 2,"The last 2 Clancy Ryan novels were so bad that this had nowhere to go but up, not a horrible read but the ""multi-plot and tie it together at the end "" book that Clancy used to hit us with is not here. A positive note is that at less than 500 pages the editing that Red Rabbit was crying for is present here. Not as many repeating scenes or dialogue. In summary, this could just as easily been Vince Flynn , if your waiting (as I am) for a Clancy comeback this isn't it, but worth a read anyway."
3,At least it was not 800-900 pages,"New generation of super-spy emerges as Jack Jr. takes reigns from his father and is teamed with a set of twins to replace Clark and Chavez. Same type scenario of saving the world via high-tech intelligence gathering and tradecraft. Clancy does a disservice by constantly referencing Jack Sr. and how much trouble `Jr.' would be in if daddy found out, which detracts from storyline. Looks like Clancy is scrapping the bottom of the barrel."
3,Get ready for the sequel(s),"""Clancy has scrapped his usual one-novel-every-two-years cycle to deliver a shorter, swifter tale""- and it shows. Unlike a lot of his earlier (own)work, this is pure serialization, along the lines of PowerPlays and NetForce (and partially Rainbow 6 which set up the game franchise rather than books)At times fast paced and well written - but a bit heavy on the ""boo-ya we good kill bad no problem"" ethos. A whirlwind tour of Europe well enough written, but rather limited character development (but rather obviously the first part in a new saga of Jack JR)good airplane/airport reading, but that's about it"
1,Mr. Clancy has lost his touch,"Can I have my money back, Mr. Clancy? When I bought this book, I thought it would be thrilling, like your other books.I am sorry to say that I actually read the thing to the end. I kept wondering when you'd bring the ""loose end"" of the plot back in. You just left it hanging.The plot is just a story about hit men. After being recruited, the younger generations of the Ryan clan go to a city. There, they murder someone they suspect of being evil. Then they go to another city and murder the next guy. And so on. They even have a magic weapon that is undetectable, so there is little chance that they will get caught. In the mean time they make small talk about fast cars. Even the ""local flavor"" of the exotic locations is boringly off."
2,Asleep at the wheel,"A staggering work of mind-numbing flotsam and jetsam. Part TV Guide, part Zagat's, part Fast Food Nation, part Fodor's, part Mr. Coffee's Holiday, this thing is brain novocain.When you wake up, read Alan Furst's Kingdom of Shadows or Ted Bell's Hawke.If TC keeps this up, he's a goner."
3,I liked the prologue better than the book,The prologue was more suspensful than the entie book all together and the prologue was only 20 pgs long. Every single mission went without a hitch in this book ceating no suspense or tension. Eventhough there was no suspence it was on the whole an okay book.
2,dull teeth,"Approximately 15 pages are devoted to action (or the semblance of action). The rest is dull, expository, and dare I say it, amateurish. I have read every Clancy novel and this one ties with Red Rabbit for the worst. Clancy isn't writing novels anymore, he's cashing checks. What a shame for his fans and his reputation.One interesting element of Clancy's works is that real events seem to follow his fiction within a year or two. The prime example - in Debt of Honor, a terrorist flies a 747 into the Capitol during a joint session of Congress. This was a few years before 9/11. Coincidence?I only hope that the one terrorist event described in Teeth of the Tiger does not happen in the United States. Time will tell."
1,What was he thinking?,"The real Tom Clancy must have been kidnapped by aliens and replaced by some kind of clone. How else can one explain how someone who brought us such terrific yarns as Red October and Patriot Games, could pen something as bad as Teeth of the Tiger.The book is terrible. The characters are one-dimensional, everyone is somehow related which is wildly contrived, and the plot is ridiculous. It is formulaic drivel at its worst."
2,No teeth in this Clancy novel,"First, i like to say that i have read just about all of Clancys books, so i think i know what i am talking about. I just finished the book and i was not very happy with it. Lets start at the beginning, first the time line does not work. Jack jr. is now an adult, but President Ryan only served one term. I also think the whole idea of the book goes against everthing that Clancy has brought us to think about Jack Ryan. He has always been the one to follow the law, now we are to believe that he would set up this group completely outside the law. I also got the sence that Jack jr was name dropping every time he was talking about his Dad,which he does throughout the book. I hope Tom Clancy will continue with his next book with Jack Ryan still President."
1,Was the ending left out?,"Sadly, having read all the previous Tom Clancy books, I couldn't resist reading this one. I wish I had. It's not a very tightly written book and one that could have been written by anyone who had read the previous books. It really reads like a Tom Clancy knockoff. My worst complaint is that it's unclear to me if it had an ending. The book I have appeared to have just run out of pages. If this is the only Tom Clancy book you have read, do yourself a favor and read some of the earlier works - believe me, they are much, much better. I will probably give him another chance because I know he can write better."
5,"A Must, MUST read for Clancy fans","One of the best in recent years...way intriguing convoluted plot twists, and we see Jack Jr growing up while trying to figure it all out....the co-authoring put Tom back onto the same game plan that left us spell bound since the Hunt For Red October....I highly recommend this novel...NO that is not strong enough....I insist you read this novel!"
2,Good 1rst half!,"Your age is showing but the intrigue is as alive as ever! In spite of Toms preachy filler and sometimes glacial plot movement I am a huge fan. This thriller starts off with the normal Clancy hook and then drags us to a sprint in the middle of the story. Unfotunately it stops there.WHAT HAPPENED??! Increasing from a book every two years to this ""Tiger"" in one has provided half a story. Even when a novel is short it needs to end.My advice is to wait to the second part of this tale to be released and then read them back to back. I hate to put a book down in the middle but that is what Mr. Clancy has forced on us with The Teeth of the Tiger."
2,Only if you like vengenance,"If you like to have people's deaths described in detail and if you like your vengance, you may like this novel. Otherwise skip it.Also, Clancy is not consistent. The first time he mentions the four terrorist targets he mentions Sacramento. The next he mentions them, Sacramento is replaced by Provo, Utah."
1,awful,"It got to the point where I kept reading just to see how bad the writing could be. I see another reviewer noted that one chapter begins with ""The sun rose promptly at dawn.""Pretty bad, but how 'bout this one: ""ESPN had a baseball game on; the Mariners were playing the Yankees, to the current detriment of the former.""Groan.When the metaphors in the narrative aren't killing you, the dialogue is. Two of the main characters are fraternal twins, an FBI agent and Marine officer, supposedly in their late 20's. When their conversation isn't completely wooden (the term ""bro"" is used about 100 times, or so it seemed) it's just not real: At one point Brian makes a reference to Grace Kelly.Grace Kelly?If Clancy's editor doesn't have the nerve to tell him that no twenty-something year old guy in present day America is going to be talking about Grace Kelly, he's not going to tell him anything."
1,Clancy fans don't read,"I absolutely love the prior Clancy books, but The Teeth of the Tiger is horrible. Clancy totally changes characters and settings from all his prior books, and his atempts to link Teeth of the Tiger to the other books destroys this book and the others. The plot of Teeth of the Tiger kills a lot of the feelings you may have had about the way Clancy writes. If I were you, I would read ALL of the books in the series up to and including The Bear and The Dragon, then stop before Clancy kills the series."
1,I miss Red Storm Rising,"I've read them all, and it's been downhill since the cold war ended. From mind-numbing dialogue (the author went to great lengths to describe seemingly every meal and visit to cafes), to implausible assasinations, this one was beyond belief. As the vigilantes took on their fourth killing, I waited for some suspense. And then the book ended. The message? Send some super twenty-somethings out into the world to kill off the terrorist threat. Now that's scary."
1,Could the REAL Tom Clancy actually have written this ??,"this book is thin, sophmoric and vapid at best. the hardcover is ""bulked-up"" by the publisher with heavy paper stock and large type spacing to appear to be more than it is. It still doesn't work. They must have been desperate to get something printed to bring in money.SAVE YOURS. If you must read it, get it from the library. If you are a devotee of the ""earlier"" Clancy, as I am, don't bother with this tripe, you'll feel cheated and sorry for the depths his recent works have fallen.It was tough to give it one star........."
2,"""Jumping the Shark"" or ""Selling Out""","I like Tom Clancy. I've read every book he's written. But this book appears to have been ""phoned in."" This novel reads like the simplistic garbage we've been getting from Patrick Robinson. No matter how evil our opponents are, if we stoop to their level, we've lost. I just don't find the characters admirable or the plot line credible. Maybe Tom should go back to writing about military men who live by a code.His works over the last few years have severely deteriorated. ""Red Rabbit"" was a hollow homage to ""Cardinal of the Kremlin."" The film ""Sum of All Fears"" was a politically correct sell-out of the novel. The ""Op Center"" books are terrible. I hope he takes this to heart and gets back on track in his next effort."
1,Childish and Moronic,"I've been a Clancy fan since book one and have purchased every one in hardcover. That will not continue. This wasn't even a good book for a 3rd rate novelist!Early Clancy novels are well thought out and you marvel at the thought and detail he put into creating believable, coplex storylines. Gone is the imagination, intrigue and suspense. The character choice of two nephews and a son of Jack Ryan pander shamelessly to readers who have developed a fondness for Ryan. That these three would come together to jointly assasinate terrorists and would be thrust into the field with no prior experience (other than standard FBI and Marine training) makes one long for the days when Clancy assumed his readers had brains.Give me a break! And a better book!"
1,Clancy phoned this one in,"Unlike his earlier works this book lacks any element of surprise or tension. Each of the missions described in this book is a cookie-cutter image of the one before and the one to follow.Both the author and editor should be ashamed of the quality of prose; one chapter opens with, ""The sun rose promptly at dawn.""This feels like it was written with the intent to go straight to a really bad computer game."
1,Even the characters are complaining about being bored!!,"Okay, I am sorry to have to write a bad review, but this is Tom Clancy! for pete's sake. How did the editors allow for this to get by?It's not badly written, but I am only half way through this story and I'm stopping the pain now. This is a 500 page novel and the first 200 has been nothing but introduction of new characters, who are each basically going through on-the-job training....Even the characters (Jack jr and his twin cousins) complain about being bored.It's obvious that this is simply a way of moving on to a new set of characters to write more novels about, and I am sure Tom Clancy's future books will make good use of these characters, but unless you really need to get to know these guys from the start, I do not recommend wasting time with this book. Sorry Tom."
1,What happened to Clancy?,"Clancy's last really good book was ""Debt of Honor."" ""Bear & the Dragon,"" ""Red Rabbit,"" and now this book have all felt like inferior, phoned-in efforts. The twins say each other's nicknames CONSTANTLY and it gets tiresome. Plus, Clancy is getting a REALLY annoying habit of finding a catchphrase and repeating it endlessly -- in the narrative, out of the one character's mouth, out of another character's mouth (ex: ""Reality is analog, not digital""). It's a fun catchphrase, Tom -- use it once, maybe twice -- NO MORE. I read Clancy for technothriller action sequences, not office procedurals or political views. Get back to what you're good at, Mr. Clancy, or stop writing."
1,like a cheap dollar store novel,"Like a cheap, mass-produced dollar store novel, this is the most predictable, long-winded and boring book this author has ever written. It is basically a ""Huah! Kill 'em all"" story with a happy ending. The German language obviously was skipped by the editors or briefly glanced at with a German-English dictionary. It is obvious that the author does not know much about the countries and the people in Europe, since the book is filled with stereotypes. And where did he come up with these old, archaic World War II names? I had very much enjoyed all the ""old"" books - Hunt for Red October, etc., but this one is just a sad waste of paper."
2,"Hey bro', what WERE you thinking?","What was worse, the dull story or the simpering voice of the narrator? Take a definite pass on either the print or the audio version, inane and puerile."
1,Is this a compendium of Redneck Stereotypes?,"I am an avid reader of all that is crime and spybusiness. There are some GREAT authors who have their very liberal or conservative views.None had such a dreadful collection of stereotypes as thsi book by Clancy presents.Ragheads, Mutts, the Bad Guys, and so on and so forth.The plot is nothing special, just riddled with totally unlikely coincidences and conspiracies for the ""greater Good"" that give even the most conservative viewer of politics the creeps.Mr Clancy is probably an accomplished writer, but whoever edits his books was probably on holiday."
2,My suspicions regarding this book,"I read the entire book on a flight from Dubai to Dulles and I suspect that it wasn't even Tom Clancy that wrote it. It just didn't ""feel"" like his writing at all. He oughta fire whoever he hired to write it for him and take his laptop down to the beach and write us all a new version of it. It could've been a great story, from time to time I've fancied the notion of some rich do-gooder vigilantes going out and dispensing some justice to the idiots in the world and I was excited to hear that the idea had been incorporated but yeah, blah.Rabin's Turnby Scott McHardy actually did a better job of it than this.I think Mr. Clancy has still got some good stuff left in him, but it's gotta be the real deal. Somethings can't be outsourced."
2,Far off standard,"This effort by Clancy has some interest, but does not comeclose to prior works of his that I have read. Almost amateurish. The ending is particularly weak......as if almost saying ""to be continued""?"
1,A 13-yr old could have written this book in a week,"This was by far the worst Tom Clancy book to date. After books like Red Storm Rising and The Hunt for the Red October, the author has certainly reached a new low.To improve, the author should probably spend a bit more time on: the plot, character development, dialog...you get the idea. Tom Clacy's first books tended to be more in-depth, while this book certainly did not scratch the surface.I'm embarrassed to say that I read this book, and I only hope that others won't waste their time."
1,This can't be from Clancy's hands,"When I read this book. I expect Tom Clancy quality, but this book really help me sleep well. It's boring and so predictable that I'm sure was write by someone else. What a shame."
1,Possibly the worst book I have ever read,"I don't know where to start.This is AWFUL.All the previous books in the series have gone from 'good' to 'excellent'.This looks like it was purely written to finance Mr Clancy's legal costs from his divorce. I can't imagine any other reason why he would have written such a load of tripe as this.This blight on our culture needs withdrawl from all book shops and any sucker (me included) who purchased it (in hardback!) to get a refund as well as compensation for the waste of their time in reading it.If you've read this try re/reading 'Red Storm Rising'. It's hard to imagine they are both written by the same guy.AWFUL....""Must try harder"""
1,Clancy Lite,"Low tech, low thrill. The publisher made a multi book mega dollar deal with the author and this is what we get? Character development is shallow, the infamous Clancy detail in technology is lacking, and even the travel scene detail is shallow."
2,The Hunt for Tom Clancy,"I was a fan before Red October became a huge success but am surpised by how terrible this ""novel"" really is. Predictable, bad plot, bad dialog, too many clashes with reality (hard to get lost in a book when it keeps screaming at you that it is fiction). Would the real Tom Clancy please step forward?"
1,What happened???,"I have been reading Clancy's novels for the past 10 years and generally thought of his writing as simple but entertaining. Then new ventures such as Net-Force, etc. ""happened"" which were weak but also easliy avoided. The core line with the Ryan books was kept at a decent level - unti now.Mr. Clancy, what happened? This should at best have been a free promotional chapter for a good upcoming book. To make matters worse, I bought this book at an airport store for about US$30 - ten lattes would have done me a lot better.Please save your money - this one's not even worthy for paper back."
2,Peat and re-peat,"For those of us who have read all of Mr. Clancy's novels, the opportunity to explore one of his children is interesting. Wrong.Arduous character development leads us to phrases such as, ""Bro."", ""jarhead"", ""roger that"", etc. It would have beento all of our advantages to hire a young journalism student towrite the dialog!!How many times do we need to be given the explanation of a newparalyzing drug and how it interacts with the human body. The repetition takes from the storyline.Where is Jack Ryan when we need him? Not in this novel. Just""Junior"" as reference is made to young Jack. How many kids evenlike the 'Jr.' handle?And last but not least, the philosophical repetition of religious dogma, bureaucratic beliefs or why the central 'Company' was even formed. All of this just to fill pages.After reading the above, maybe I'll change my rating to one starin hopes Mr. Clancy's next work is at least interesting!"
3,Now I understand...,"Before I read this book I couldn't understand how this couldpossibly be a Clancy novel. After all, it was a ""mere"" 480 pages!None of Clancy's books are less than 700 pages! But Clancy'yform is to use 400-500 pages to set up the characters and situationand use that last 200 pages (or so) to tell the fast paced actualstory. True to form Clancy sticks to the tried and true. Thefirst 400-500 pages set up the situation and character and thelast 200 pages... Wait a second! The last 200 pages are missing!This book is so clearly an incomplete story as to leave nodoubt that soon another book (with another fee) will be publishedto finish (or perhaps only continue) the story that was lefthanging in ""The Teeth of the Tiger""."
1,Moronic,"Clancy. Take a break. The 3 cousins are unbelievable morons. But I bought the book, so I guess the joke is on me."
4,Looks like half of a book,"This book looks as if it is the first half of a larger book, that was divided to keeps the size reasonable. I expect to soon see a follow-up book in which the Americans take on the real leaders of the terrorist group."
3,not one of his better books,"It was a fairly good book but i was expecting more, I mean the climax was stabbing a bunch of people with pens. If it wasnt clancy it would have been better even though the plot was simplistic."
1,BA HUMBUG,"I found this latest in the Ryan series to be totally out of character and off in left field from the Ryan's in previous book. Picturing Jack Ryan authorizing and supporting a venture such as is put forth in the book is so far out of character as to be laughable. This book has put Tom Clancy on my scan before buy list, no more mail orders, have to check before buying. This is from a previously die hard fan, first edition hard bounds of everything in fiction starting with Hunt for Red October."
1,Possibly the worst book in the history of the modern novel,"I can't believe I read the whole thing. Very early on, I saw the direction this trite, jingoistic piece of garbage was heading, but I hung on, convincing myself that it couldn't get worse. Was I wrong! This book is a total waste of time. Not only is it a wasted effort, it may actually have killed brain cells. It left an incredibly bad taste in my mouth because I fear that Mr. Clancy's philosophy is reflected in our present government's actions."
2,More about politics,"Clancy seems to spend more time in the minds of his characters espousing what seem to be his own political beliefs. He's obviously changed as a writer from classics like Hunt for the Red October, I for one am not so impressed. This book seems to end abruptly, definitely setting up sequels. Also, the villains are not as well developed as previous novels. In other books, you felt that you understood the villains motivation, if not agreeing with them. The book is timely as far as terrorism is concerned and for that reason alone may satisfy a lot of readers. If you're not interested in Clancy's political views, skip this one. Perhaps there will be a better plot and more action in the next novel."
2,Another Blah.....,"I'm the worlds biggest Tom Clancy fan. I'm now through two books in a row that have been lousy. Red Rabbit was bad. This one is bad too. It reads like an Op-Center book. Quick, predictable and somewhat hard to believe. Jack Ryan jr. and his twin cousins all by chance end up at the same covert operations center? Wow, what a coincidence. I still think there's a multiple book contract we're trying to fulfill. Where's Red Storm Rising or Executive Orders or The Sum of All Fears? I miss the depth of these immediate classics and I'm still waiting"
2,Boring,"As with all of Tom Clancy's novels, there is a great deal of detail. Since the book is much shorter than any of his other novels (431 pp.), I figured that Mr. Clancy would spend less time developing plots and characters and more time with action. HOWEVER, except for a few bright spots, I found the book extremely boring. I read every word until about page 200, then I found myself skipping around. One thing that was interesting was descriptions of methods used by our security forces to track down criminals using the internet. But, in my humble opinion, even this could have been done better and with less minutiae. No doubt there will be a sequel, but I won't be wasting my time with it. It is a shame, because the subject of this book (dealing with radical Islamic fundamentalists who want to do nothing more than destroy the US) is so widespread and prevalent today. I am sure that there will be many other books dealing with this subject. Maybe Clive Cussler has something in the works."
2,"No conflict, drama or plausability","There were no surprises. Nothing interesting. Nothing worth the price of admission.Also, the premise that Jack Ryan left blank presidential pardons is a bit far fetched. How can that possibly be legal since they won't be used until after he is president. Under that plan, he could pardon himself for a crime he might commit in the future. Sorry Tom but I don't buy it. Actually I did buy it and wish I didn't What happened to the Sum of all Fears, Clear and Present Danger, Executive Orders, Hunt for Red October, etc.? Those were amazing books. This was pure crap!"
3,Baby teeth only,"Throughout the whole book, I had a hard time believing Tom Clancy wrote it. I'm a devoted fan and was thrilled to see a new Clancy on the stands. But I was disappointed with the slow, slow, slow pace, the erratic style (some paragraphs were a page long; others were three sentences), and the lack of action until the last hundred pages. Yes, there were some things I enjoyed: three likeable, new characters in the Jack Ryan venue and Clancy's willingness to take on the moral consciousness of America as it explores being an aggressor in eliminating world evil.The review of old characters lasted too long, and in the end, I felt that the real purpose of this book was not to tell a story of new characters but to set them up for future books. Readers who enjoy Clancy's enviable knowledge of new and future technologies will find very little in this book as well."
2,Clancy let down,Not Clancy's best effort by a long shot. The plot is too far-fetched with far too many cutesy one-liners for a story about anti-terrorism and American assassins. My take is that Clancy is shooting for a film adaptation and wrote this with that objective in mind. It reads like a prequel or a teaser to a more serious and well-written novel to come along later.
3,"Our heroes aren't made, they're bred","After Rainbow 6 I thought Clancy had painted himself into a corner. The thought of reading ""The Further Adventures of Ding and His Multinational Threat Control Group"" was a little unsettling. Instead Mr. Clancy goes back in time, gives us more of the Foley dynamic duo action (a'la Cardinal of the Kremlin) and then forward to bring out a next generation. This book was a pretty good read and I would recommend as foundation material for the following books that are sure to come. If Mr. Clancy could write every book as good as HFRO or DoH, I would grow a uterus and have his babies, but til then I'll just keep reading his books."
2,Bring back the old characters,"These new characters are like old Clancy lite. Watered down versions of everyone's favorite characters, Clark, Jack Ryan, the Foleys, Ding...I did not like this book..."
3,Give Mr. Clancy a Break!!,"Do you remember all the words to the Eagles? Rolling Stones? The Beatles? Of course not. They had off moments as artists, why can't a former insurance man with a penchant for detail?Only in America can an artist such as he go from Insurance to whatever kind of Mercedes he wants. Tom Clancy is an American Icon, but also a man who lives in Maryland, is Catholic and happens to be an author.Its perfectly acceptable to me if an author wants to interject some of his own beliefs and politics in his work. I would call that executive privledge of the guy to puts pen to paper or keyboard to computer.As Ronald Regan called him : ""a teller of great yarns"". That's enough for this Republican. Good Day."
2,the Teeth of the Tiger needs a trip to the dentist,"There were a couple of faux pas in here that one would wonder what was Tom really thinking of as he wrote. He has the ring leader Mohammed in first class and he is smoking???? He has the terrorists in a back seat travelling to a mall and reading Playboy magazine??? Arent we past the smoking habit for the last 10 years or so on airplanes. And, since when do the followers of Allah read playboy, I dont think so.Did Tom really write this? It was dissapointing as to it's lack of expert background and the ending leaves you with a big >>>>>> WHAT THE HECK??????????"
1,At least it was shorter,"This book was considerably shorter than other recent Clancy novels I've seen. That fact, and his usual excellent story idea, are the only positive things I can say about it.The premise is that a non-government agency exsists whose mission is to identify, locate, and execute terrorist leaders. As usual these recent years, the book appears to have been written by a committee who will be paid by the word and consequently never uses one word when a couple of dozen can be used. And it seems that no one is collating the committee's efforts, so that the same things get said over and over.When the story progresses, it progresses satisfactorily, with the good guys (Jack Ryan's son and nephews) performing well, but, on the whole, I'm sorry I spent the money and time that this read cost me."
4,Finally,"Finally a Clancy book that's not too long and has been properly edited!This is a great story, of course dealing with terrorism and terrorists and what we do about it set in the Clancy-universe. He introduces three new characters (Jack Ryan's son and 2 nephews) that I hope will be featured in future tails.My only complaint - the ending seemed as if he was counting words and hit his number and just stopped. Too many loose ends. So, Tom, please don't make us wait 2 years for the next book. Thank you."
3,Clearly the first part of a series,"This book is a very typical Clancy work. If you like his past work, you will enjoy this one.One prime difference is the length. It is only about 430 pages, which is about half the length of his typical novels. And the length is indicative of the story, it works like a book that has already been completely written and this is just the first part.In addition, this book is about Jack Jr. not President Ryan. The backstory (as told in the other books) is referenced in this book, but even that back story seems ineffective at building Jack Jr. I think the reader is expected to assume that Junior is a younger version of Jack Sr. And as such, there is not a serious attempt at building this character separately from his father.I probably have been overly critical in this review. Clancy's works are full of suspense and intrigue, and generally written well. This one is also, but it could have been better."
2,VERY Disappointing,"I read every single Clancy book. Then I read Red Rabbit, which I found very disappointing. Then I read this Teeth of the Tiger. Clearly, this wasn't written by Clancy - I wouldn't care either way, except that the quality is soooo awful. There is no excitement in the entire book. There's a plot, but it's worth about 20 pages. It reads more like a biography, in the sense that there is only one thing going on, (not multiple storylines, like other books.)Worse than Red Rabbit, and really not neccesary to read just to say you've read all the Jack Ryan books."
3,Entertaining,"I got the book to keep me company on a trip with several long airport layovers and it filled the bill nicely. Can't say there were any deep revelations or life-changing philosophies expressed but the characters & plot seemed believable. There were a couple of examples of my personal pet peeve though that I was surprised to see from someone of Clancy's stature. In a couple of places he had the characters getting cash from an ""ATM machine."" Since we seem to like 'repetitive redundancies,' perhaps we could have been told that they entered their ""PIN numbers"" in order to do so? There was one place where another character was ""returning back"" to someplace. It's little stuff but it just grates on my nerves whenever I see it."
4,"Look at it as modern ""Juvenile Fiction""","Return to the days of Tom Swift, Tom Slade, Rick Brant, the Hardy Boys and Ken Holt. Tom Clancy has started a modern series of Juvenile Fiction where consequences don't have to logically follow unless they are essential to the plot and coincidental occurences are not astonishing.This is not a ""Clancy"" novel as we've come to expect but I don't think it was written to be. It's an enjoyable read both for the simplistic activity leading to a quick read and for prompting thoughts on how differently the actions would play out in real life."
1,Lossing his style,"Tom... please go back to the 2 year cycle. I would wait anxiously for the next Jack Ryan series and devour it.. fulfulled. Unfortunately -this tigers teeth has cavities.To many coincidences (twins and Jack's son all on same team?) The terrorist were caught sooo easily. Yet in reality we cant catch Osama and Sadam.Also - mistakes. TOM! mistakes. The knife at the end fell on the floor BUT on that same page, Junior takes it out of his hands? And the chemical would be detected by the man run over by the street car. This was FLAT... Kick it back up Tom - your involved in to much and it shows. see ya in 2 years!"
2,Will he charge us again for the 2nd half of the story?,"Like several other of the reviewers, I have been a fan since Red October. However, the last Clancy saga I really enjoyed was Rainbow Six. I would have been even willing to put up w/ the central characters that act, speak, and think alike. However, when I found the pages running out without even a truly satisfying payoff, I really felt cheated. I may find future volumes from the library, but I will not be rushing off in the future to purchase them."
4,Jack Ryan: The Next Generation,"Remember when Jack Ryan was just a CIA analyst, before he became the Agency's superstar and the President of the United States? Well, he's retired now but the legend lives on through his son Jack Junior and his nephews the Caruso brothers. Maybe it takes three young men to replace the master, but that's okay with me because they work well. Clancy's writing has most of the same traits that readers either loved or hated in earlier books; I happen to like his style enough to enjoy his books immensely. Recommended."
1,I'm Much Better Now,"I love the other Jack Ryan books, and I even like ""Red Rabbit"", but not this travesty. I read it back when it was first published, and I was so angry that my review was taken down.I was shocked that Clancy would have a sitting President resign presumably To Pursue Other Projects. Especially someone with such a strong moral compass.It was bad enough that Ryan's choice of a vice-president way back in ""Executive Order"" was the rankest cronyism, but the guy had no interest in politics. It would have been more believable if he had been assassinated by a Political Science major.And then there was the whole killing-an-unarmed-man-because-child-molesters-are-wimps-and-never-put-up-a-fight. I expect more from the FBI and from Tom Clancy."
2,C- effort,Clancy's classic novels include complex plots and heros. This plot could be easily adapted to a TV movie (motive?) and the book's two heros are immature and inexpert. Disappointing.
3,"Good at first, but then...","Someone dropped the ball bigtime. Clancy starts off the first half of the book with the usual Clancyism: detailed information on all of the major characters, down to the gas mileage of the rental Crown Victoria that the terrorist team uses. However, when Aldo and Enzo's roles become clarified, the story starts to take a nosedive. The action scenes and the method of dispatching the targets almost seems comical. As we progress towards the end of the book, it seemed like Clancy suddenly realized there was a deadline and started slapping together an ending. It definitely appeared crude and rushed and quite frankly, I began to become disinterested. The ending was particularly anti-climatic to say the least."
2,Disappointing,"Actually the first half of the novel wasn't bad - that's why I gave it two stars. But he gets technical details about the method of assassination wrong (perhaps on puropse so as not to provide a cookbook for someone)and that makes me wonder how much of the stuff I found so fascinating in other books wasn't really accurate either.The second half of the novel just didn't keep my interest, in fact it took me 4 days to stay awake long enough to read the last 20 pages. And I closed the book thinking ?so?Resting on his laurels? Lost the spark? Not sure, but I'll have to read rave reviews before I buy any more Clancy books."
1,Gums of a Pussycat,I would give zero stars if possible. This book was a big disappointment. I read to the end only because I could not believe Tom Clancy would write this poorly. He did.The characters were shallow and unbelievable. The plot was weak and had massive holes on logic and technology. The plot - wasn't.Was this ghost written for an author too busy with other projects to even review it before submitting it to the publisher? Where were the editors?I can not recommend this book to anyone. Before I buy another Clancy book I will carefully research it for quality.
1,Bad,If this were the first book Tom Clancy wrote there wouldn't be any Tom Clancy empire. He gets away from the techno-military stuff for more ordinary spy games. He retires his two best characters--John Clark and Jack Ryan. And the ending is awful. This is the third book in a row that's not been up to the level that we have come to expect from Clancy. This would've have made a mediocre Op-Center book.
1,PUT IT DOWN !,"ONCE YOU PUT THIS BOOK DOWN,YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PICK IT UP AGAIN !Could not finish. Worst book ever."
1,Oh Tom where did you go?,"I have been a big Clancy fan since The Hunt for Red October, but this was a major disappointment. This one is as bad as the movie they did for The Sum of All Fears. This books lacks everything a Clancy fan wants. Unless you're a brain dead teen stay clear of this one."
1,A miserable disappointment,"This one is a miserable disappointment. No plot, no decent characters; in short, it is a bore. The notion that the Government would commission a couple of idiots like this to run around illegally killing people is, well, who knows? At any rate, pass this one by. I have thoroughly enjoyed many of Clancy's novels. Not this one. RJB."
1,Bad!!!,In the past I have loved Tom Clancy's books. This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It's hard for me to believe this boring book without an engaging plot was written by Clancy. I listened to the CD version. The reader made it even more boring and evident to me that the many sarcastic comments in the text were in poor taste.
1,Awful dialogue!,"I would have never believed this was a Tom Clancy book - sure he didn't use a ghost writer? The characters were shallow, the dialogue innane and the premise ridiculous! The twins called each other 'bro' more times than can be counted -- not what you'd expect from educated, sophisticated adults. And sending a junior analyst (the former President's son no less) into a danger zone with virtually no preparation, was not even close to believable. These characters have a long way to go to sell more books in this series!"
1,One star is an overrating for this idiotic novel,"This book is a terrible. I bought it as a ""Bargain Book"" andstill grossly overpaid for it.I wish I had read the online reviews, because I really never imaginedthat a Clancy novel could be so poorly conceived and written."
2,I suspect Clancy didn't write this one,"I am a long time Clancy fan, and I read 'Red Storm Rising' on the bottom deck of the USS Saipan, which, in the book, takes three torpedo hits and goes down with 2700 souls. I have read Clancy since book one, and for me, his quality has always been high. This one was a bust. The characters were idiotic and forced, like those of a third-rate author. Realism has always been Clancy's forte. Trust me: I could have done better myself."
2,I should have read the other reviews...,"As I have finished this book and found myself dissappointed with it, and have scrolled through the reviews to write my own, I just regret not reading them before impulsively buying this book.You will not find in this book the characteristics of the great Clancy work from the late 80s and 90s. The book is tremendously slow (it never picks up steam), characters are terribly weak (specially that immature and arrogant Jack Ryan Jr.), and not even the rush-to-the-end is exciting.I lost many hours of sleep while reading the initial Clancy work. You just could not stop reading. It never happened this time.There are many good books in this world. Don't waste your time with this (as I did...)."
1,moved to write my first review,"Simply dreadful. Banal drivel for the characters' dialogue, 'wooden' characters, incredible coincidence, unbelievable choice, truly objectionable morals for the good guys (author's prerogative) and 'damp squid' of an ending. Thank you, Mr. Clancy, for your earlier enjoyable novels."
1,"Who's writing your books now, Tom?","I've read every one of Tom Clancy's novels, several more than once. Was a time the news of a new Clancy sent me directly to the nearest bookstore. Recently I picked up ""Teeth of the Tiger"" at an airport having been unaware of its release. That's because the last couple of Clancy's novels have been a bit disappointing--not up to the high standard he set with his early novels. ""Tiger"" reaches a new low, sad to say. I find it hard to believe Mr. Clancy has even written the past couple of novels. The plots are predictable, the style has gotten clunky and repetitive, the language pedestrian, the dialogue unbelievable. And please stop telling your readers the same thing twice. You do it now time and again. We get it the first time. Oh for the thrill of reading page-turners as good as ""Red October,"" ""Clear and Present Danger,"" all of them up through ""Without Remorse."" Ah, well, thanks for those Mr. C. I'm not complaining. I'm just wistful. JW"
1,Disappointing!,"Agree with foregoing reviews. Unless one wants to see the phrase ""bad guys"" used at least 10,000 times in one book, this novel has nothing to offer. I would love to see Clancy return to the originality, interest level, and compelling storytelling of the majority of his his early productions"
2,Not Clancy's best,"Clancy is continuing to make money (good for him!). This book is certainly destined to be a movie, but is not much of a story."
2,Filling a book quota?,"I've read all of Clancy's major fiction and some of the non-fiction, and I am generally a big fan. Unfortunately, I think that he's in an 0-2 slump. Red Rabbit was boring. Teeth of the Tiger is not so much boring as it is not compelling. Maybe Clancy is trying to portray real espionage for what it is, fairly dull. I am far from a literary snob, but I found the conversations to be methodical and forced, and the lack of action - or even tension, to be very apparent.I surely hope for better Clancy soon. I agree with some other reviews that the only purpose of this book seemed to have was to introduce characters for later books. Or maybe TC was just trying to meet a quota."
2,Better than the past couple but still not up to snuff,"It starts with a good begining, moves in to a dull middle and then an unsatisfiying predictable ending. I really have a problem with his dialog. Every character talks like a 50 year former member of the military."
1,"Poor, poor, poor","Poor writing. Bad editing. Plenty of inconsistencies. Repetitive. Booring, undeveloped predictable plot. Booring, stereotypical, predictable characters. The downhill slide that started with 'Rainbow Six' continues. The author of 'Red Storm Rising' is nowhere to be found in this yawner!"
4,clancy does it again,I am a big fan of tom clancy. This book is as good as the rest of the series. I hardly could put the book down. A definite buy.
2,Sad Ending(?) of Clancy's Ryan Saga,"After all the pleasure that Tom Clancy has provided with his exciting,realistic and informative Jack Ryan series, The Teeth of the Tiger is a major disappointment. The book is unfocused, lacks any coherent plot line, and leaves huge wholes in the timeline and settings created in the earlier Ryan novels. I found myself wanting to read unwritten books that would explain major story line reversals, rather than this sad, half-hearted effort."
2,It was OK. ...,"If this was a stand alone book it would have been ok. As part of the Jack Ryan Series, it missed the mark. I actually liked Red Rabbit better. Red Rabbit was not a great story, but at least you got some history of the characters you've been reading about in other stories. In this book, NOTHING. ..."
4,This is chapter one of many to come,"Ok, the book in general is a good Clancy read which i finished in a few days. He mentions many subjects in this book that could lead you to believe that a book that would fill the time period between this one and Executive Orders or Rainbow Six is in the works. This book introduces us to three new characters. Jack Jr. and his two cousins and another anti-terrorist group operating out side of normal channels. Clancy keeps the plot flowing but doesn't really build the character's background very well. Perhaps he'll fill the gaps in, in later novels. If you like Clancy's other books you'll like this one."
4,We're back on track...,"It was good to be drawn in again to the Clancy we all know and love. He takes the ""Ryan"" legacy to intense and interesting levels and pulls the reader into the story. I had a hard time putting it down as it tapped into my political curiosities and patriotic emotions. The contemporaneous setting truely allows the reader to become intellectually involved with the plots and how the characters are developed.The ending? Sounded like Mr. Clancy has the follow-up already in the works. Strongly recommend!"
1,This is hitting bottom.,"I had put up with Clacy's right wing views in the past because he spun a good yarn. Here his opinions go over the cliff and it is not even a good yarn. He has the son of a former US president getting a job without the press taking notice. He has him wandering around Europe unrecognized and performing clandestine missions. Give me a break. The worst part of it, however, is that is is OK for an arm of the US government to systematically murder people who they thought were terrorists.The man ought to give himself a break and write a halfway believeable book."
4,Wake up people,"Yes there has been better Clancy but this is a lot better than the last two. In addition I think it should be a wake up for the average American ( and European as well). It goes to the mind of the Islamic Militant like few other writers have had the courage to do.All of us should read it. It has nothing to do with prejudice but rather psychologically analyzes the militant's mindset. It helps if you can remember(or learn) the history of the crusades and their aftermath.Paranoia it isn't, reality, unfortunately it is."
1,Poor Tom Clancy,Tom Clancy stole money from a Black-Ops program and will be looking over his shoulder for the rest of his life.
4,Now Tom Tittlates Anti-Terrorism Tactics Bureaucrats,"On a mass scale or in a paranoid individual Clancy fictionalizes possible counter-terrorism tactics that leave the ""enemy"" afraid of its own shadow.Osama is dead, and the possibility of successfully highjacking another airliner with a box cutter is now zero. ""Let's Roll"" says it all."
2,Not Up To Par,"I was a bit skeptical to pick up this book after the last Clancy book that left me wanting a bit more, but I did, and I'm wishing I had just re-read another of his previous books. This book lacks character development and action but is quite long on play-on-words and colloquialisms, making it hard to read. In fact, I only have about 60 pages to finish it and I just dread picking it up. I think I'll jump to the end - I don't think I'll miss anything. Final word - if you want to read a great Tom Clancy book, re-read Debt of Honor or Clear and Present Danager."
4,Excellent action,"Tom Clancy fans will certainly enjoy his latest installment and those who have never read Clancy before will be drawn in by his always timely ""what-if"" plot. You don't need to have read a Clancy book in the past to enjoy this action thriller, although characters and events from past novels are referenced now and then, this novel stands on its own. Not nearly as dense as past novels nor as difficult to get into. This novel has fewer complicated characters to keep track of and begins in mid-action. The plot deals with the idea of fighting back against terrorists in an unconvential manner. Interesting and entertainig both."
1,Clancy's WORST,Being an avid reader of all of Clancy's books I was unpleasantly surprised by this book. It is very predictable from the beginning to end. The characters are unbelievable and not developed. There is obviously going to be a sequel with this book but I'm going to wait for the paperback in a used book store.
1,"Ramble, repeat, relive, regurgitate",Tom Clancy says this is his last book for a while because he needs a rest. I fully agree. I have been a Clancy fan from the beginning and always enjoyed his work. Until now!The books starts slow and stays slow. The characters are as shallow as the plot. It seems that half the book was spent reflecting about Clancy's earlier characters and ... discussion about the morality of assassinating terrorists. Then we had 50 pages of terrorists driving across the country with the only excitement being which Interstate turn came next.I suspect Clancy's name will help sell some copies. The quality of the book sure won't.
1,Clancy's call for a facist future,"Clancy has found the solution to the world's terrorism problem: A clandestine US agency, without any political overight from venal politicians, will send out teams of assassins to kill anyone it pleases. And to keep out of the eye of Congress, the President, or anyone else, it will fund itself through thievery.The book ends with a series of Keystone Kops-like assassinations; but ""ends"" is too strong a verb. It merely halts in mid-plot, inviting you to read the next book if you can stomach it.Actually, this book is an improvement over Clancy's previous works. Unlike, for example, _Executive Orders_, someone actually seems to have read it before it was published; I'd like to give that editor some credit for helping reduce (but _not_ eliminate) the boring repetition I've learned to expect, but then again the editor did publish it anyway..."
1,Did Clancy really write this book ?,"This book is NOTHING like the earlier Clancy books. It lacks the plot depth and detail. However, it is very simillar to his more recent offerings in that there are many cliched phrases and unnatural language. I cringed everytime one of the principal characters said ""bro"". Nobody talks the way Clancy writes !!! It seems Clancy is trying to churn out as many books as possible until the franchise he built with the first few (EXCELLENT) books completely dies out. I had decided not to buy his next book after Red Rabbit but gave in with Teeth of the Tiger. Never Again. I feel very comfortable NOT recommending this book to Clancy fans."
2,Disappointed,"I've read all the Clancy books except Red Rabbit, and that because the reviews were so bad. I love Clancy and love his politics, but this book is way short of expectations. I was able to skim pages and not lose the story, not so in his earlier books where you had to read every word. Much of it was filler. The story could have been told easily in 200 pages. The story was also very predictable. Very disappointing."
3,"An improvement, but not great","First, a disclaimer -- I am a die-hard Clancy fan and rank Sum of all Fears and Rainbow Six as two of the best novels I have ever read. Having said that, The Bear and the Dragon and Red Rabbit were just plain aweful! The Teeth of the Tiger is an improvement over the last two books, but still leaves much to be desired. The action, particularly in the second half, was better than his recent efforts, but the story never seemed to pull together and Jack Jr.'s role was, well, underwhelming. TC WAS the very best, and I long for (and hope for!) his return to his story-telling skills of the early years."
2,The Teeth of the Tiger,"You can't always hit a home run. So after Tom Clancy produced the dreadfully boring Red Rabbit, I assumed it was just one mis-hit and he would get his swing back. I was wrong.The Teeth of the Tiger is so overwritten and boring that one has to wonder if Clancy has lost his touch or if someone else is writing under his name.So little happens in the book that a good editor would have pared it down to 100 pages.For Clancy fans, it is an exercise in frustration. Instead of the excitement that made his earlier books so enjoyable, Clancy wastes many pages with meaningless facts. Did you know that a Porsche has small trunk space? Clancy thought that was so important he mentioned it more than once. Did you know that the Mercedes' navigation system actually tells you where to turn? He mentioned this numerous times but never developed it into the storyline.In the book, his old hero, Jack Ryan, has left the limelight and gone into semi-retirment. It may be time for Clancy to follow."
2,Hardly a page turner....,"After reading and enjoying all of Clancy's novels and most of his non-fiction series, I viewed the lackluster ""Red Rabbit"" as an anomoly. Unfortunately I was wrong, ""The Teeth of the Tiger"" is just as bad.Previously I would read his work well into the night and devour the book quickly. With ""The Teeth of The Tiger"" I spent more than a week just on the first half. I found myself glancing at the book on my nightstand and reaching for the TV remote. When I did read it was just a chapter at a time.The characters are like cardboard and young Jack Ryan Jr. lacks any of the pizazz the his fathers character had. The antagonists were paper cutouts and lacked any depth. I get more character development out of a Time Magazine article on suicide bombers in Tel Aviv.I've always liked the action/adventure genre but the authors tend to have a definate lifespan. I believe Clancy has reached the end of his.Too Bad."
3,not his usual work,"this book just sets the stage for future books. Also this is the third review I have given on this book that states this and none have been ""published""...guess Amazon wants to sell more books rather than really listen to customers opinions...."
3,Not Clancy's Best,"The first third of the book was tedious going, but fortunately it picks up in Clancy's usual style. Worth reading to see where the next plot lines will be going"
3,Not quite as good,I enjoyed the story lines and overall liked the book. My disappointment is that it read more like a Clive Cussler novel than a Tom Clancy. Tom Clancy's books have always been a more involved story with more actual technical details which brought the book to life. This one doesn't have that. It focuses on the character's relationships and personal perspectives. The larger print and fewer pages seems like this one was put out in a hurry. I did enjoy it but it is not up to prior standards.
1,Not worthy of Clancy,"I was excited about the release of a new Clancy book because it's publication date was perfectly timed with a long planned and much needed vacation. But the more I read the more I developed the feeling that if I heard Jack Jr. start one more sentence with ""When Dad..."", or ""Dad says..."" I would throw the book into the Atlantic and go buy the latest Catherine Coulter!Besides the sin of being overly preachy, which is an unfortunate trait Clancy picked up a few volumes ago, this book is just BAD. The character development is childish, the plot is predictable and dumb, and the dialogue is weak (unless you want to hear the two cousins refering to each other in every other sentence in their cute little nicknames from childhood).Alas, if this is what we can expect from Clancy going forward then maybe he needs to consider hanging up his pen and enjoying the well deserved reputation he built up over the years. This book is not worthy of his talent - or your money."
2,"more "" cat in the hat"" than tiger teeth","clancy seems to be in his dotage; first ""red rabbit"" now ""teeth of the tiger""; both enferior clancy. can't compare to ""red storm rising"" or ""rainbow six""the plot is a little too juvenile and full of coincidence, also contrived scenes. GREAT DISSAPOINTMENT. save your money and wait to borrow somebody's used paperback."
2,I've read all of Clancy's books...,"...but this might be the last one I waste any time on. I mean, how many times do the characters have to ponder the same moral dilemma over and over...sheesh, Tom...we get the point. This was a short book for Clancy, only 431 pages. He could have done the same story, and had the same impact, in 200 pages. I don't want to ruin it further for anyone insisting on reading it so I'll be vague. Be forewarned...after the first few pages of action...NOTHING HAPPENS for the rest of the book. There is no action and little in the way of tradecraft excitement. In fact, while the premise has possibilities, the way in which the story unfolds would never happen that way...the three cousins operating together...gimme a break. This is more like a Nancy Drew or Hardy Boys plot. For Clancy fans...just remember the good times and find a new favorite author."
2,Teeth of the Pussy Cat?,"This book has its moments, but too many of them are tedious and ridiculous. The Cold War having ended, it seems Clancy is desperately trying to hitch his wagon to the War on Terrorism. Trouble is he doesn't really have anything of substance to say about it. Except maybe the war will be resolved by a couple of twenty year old super-soldiers. This book must have been a contract filler with the publisher.... Maybe Clancy will do better next time."
2,disappointing,"There's not much meat to this for 480 pages, for a Tom Clancy book.I usually feel he introduces a new world, some new ideas, secrets,dangerous, the opposite of mundane everyday life. Here he introduces new characters and a disbelief-stretching new organization, and follows their surprisingly mundane everyday lives. It wasn't as exciting and the more tense or emotional situations didn't ring very true. Teeth of the Tiger is still afun read, but you come out at the other end wondering where therest of it is."
2,where's the second half?,This book ends rather abruptly...The story just gets going when the book ends. I don't think it's anaccident that it's so short (480 pages) -- this is only the first half of the novel.Sigh.
2,Progressively getting worse,"Tom Clancy's books are getting progressively worse. This is by far the worst of his books. I am a die hard fan but finding in harder and harder to get through his books. I couldn't even make it 50 pages through Red Rabbit. I'm basically all the way through this one and can't believe how poor the writing, the story line, the characters all are. It's almost comical - I picture Tom Clancy laughing all the way to the bank. I wonder if he even wrote any of this or let his 13 year old neighbor or grandson write it. Stay away from this book. There's much better writers of Clancy's genre and the story line of Jack Ryan & Co. is essentially dead."
1,Very boring,I have read many of Clancy's books and this is easily his worst work. Lazy writing and predictable plot lines. Is this a blip in Clancy's career or has he made so much money that he doesn't try very hard anymore? We won't know until his next novel.
1,What happend to Tom Clancy?!?,"There was nothing to this book. As a long-time Clancy fan, I was hoping that 'Teeth of the Tiger' would be another high-powered, high-tech thriller. It had the potential to be a very dark yet consuming storyline, and could have laid the foundation for a new series. But what a dissapointment! This read more like one of the Op-Center series, with even less technology, character development, or plot. Made me wonder whether Tom Clancy had anything to do with writing it..."
1,Ended When it Started,This book was worth maybe $6.95 as a paperback. It ended when Clancy usually gets started. We are used to his books starting slow but to end shortly thereafter was disappointing at best. Wait for the paperback hand-me-down.
3,Wait ...,"Wait for the 2nd half of this story. First 1/2 of a novel. If you buy it, you'll end up stopping in the middle of a story.Has the start of an avg novel, but that's all there is."
1,Last One,"There was a time when every other August a Tom Clancy novel would appear on the bookshelves to be purchased sight unseen. After the last two novels, Red Rabbit and Teeth of the Tiger, those days are past. Clancy's novels have become so trite and predictable as to become almost unreadable. His jingoistic style has degraded to the point where it's almost comical. There are moments in Teeth of the Tiger that harken back to the Clancy of old, his description of the terrorist group's Mexican/American border crossing showed the depth and texture that used to be the hallmark of a Clancy novel, unfortunately those moments are few in this ""mailed in"" effort.How disappointing."
1,Boring Boring Boring,"This book was another big disappointment. I was hoping that Red Rabbit was a fluke, but it wasn't. At least this one is only 431 pages instead of the usual repetitive 1000+. Clancy really needs to leave Jack Ryan and company behind and come up with some fresh new plots and characters..."
1,Kindle edition ripoff,"The description for this book states that there are pictures. While pictures are expensive to insert into traditional paperbacks, it is virtually free to insert them into a Kindle book. However I bought the Kindle edition and there are NO pictures. This is pure laziness and I will be requesting a refund. If you are interested in reading a good true crime book on the Kindle I can't recommend this book."
3,Head Shot,"This book really freaked me out. One because I am from Tacoma and am familiar with the locations and 2nd because, although I didn't realize it at the time, I recently met one of the killers. The book says he is still in prison but HE IS NOT. A freind read the book and mentioned the name. When I looked at the picture of him in the book, there was no question. The book is writen well and the first 4 or 5 chapters are really great. After that the details of the courtroom procedings get kind of repetative. I reccomend it for anyone that is into true crime novels however."
1,Not worth it,I usually like true crime but I didn't even finish this book. It just didn't keep my interest. Probably won't read another from this author.
3,Head Shot,The story was interesting to a certain point but I became bored reading it toward the end. I like true crime stories but prefer books written by Ann Rule and M. William Phelps to most true crime writers.
2,Sophmoric,"If a title indicates something special with a character's dance, and the character herself has a unique ability, why is there so little reference to it in the plot? It was just a lure, and a poor one at that. A very common romance without that spark."
1,Probably the worst book I have Ever Read.,"This boook is the worst book I have Ever read, the leading lady(Ariel) is weak and simple minded. The leading man is just as weak and a complete simpleton. If I had to read ""what are you doing to me"" one more time I was going to scream. The other characters in this book were just as weak and not very pleasant to read about."
2,Not worth the money,"Sadly the writer of the blurb on the cover did not write the entire book. I can usually plow through slow beginnings or even maintain credibility when the plot elements don't make sense. But this book failed to entertain at all. The characters were boring and uninteresting - I just didn't care what happened to them!Writers of futuristic romance should be more aware of some of the things that would be different in a world that was so advanced. The holes in the sci-fi were too large to ignore. In many ways this looks like a short story that got enlarged- and doesn't have the goods to fill the pages so they became entangled in useless adjectives, and description that merely reinforced the fact that it was lacking in a good strong plot and a well researched background."
4,Very helpful,"The title is real cute. The cover looks like a ""got milk?"" commercial. I gave one of these to my niece in college. She loves it. Every time she opens it to call someone or add a name she gets encouragement from the word. That means a lot because she's away from home. I also have my own and its very durable and convenient. It has a line for keeping track of people's birthdays which I like. I also like the notes pages at the back of the book, but there should be more of those."
2,Bad Quality Materials,"Beautiful Shoes, really confortable, but with no more than 2 months using them, are showing signs of damage.A very bad purchase. If you are thinking of buying a pair, better consider other options."
5,another team-up that was great,"wow liza & petshop boys = results wish they do another one again.love pains,don't drop bombs,losing my mind,etc.if you weren't a fan of them u will be once u hear the cd."
1,A Reissue Doesn't Make It Good,"This reissue doesn't improve on the original. A bad album is a bad album. You want to listen to a good Liza CD? ""Gently"" is it. Don't waste any money on this."
5,Motion Pro spoons,These spooons are awesome!!!Good leverage. and the ends have good curves to get under and in!!Defonitely reccomend them to a friend.
1,Radical Left-wing reading,"The only people that could agree with this book are far, far left wing. Candence simply rides on her brother's fame and runs roughshoud over him. This is one book that should stay in the closet."
3,Cute,"These earrings are cute. They almost look cheap, but seem to be well made. I haven't actually worn them yet, so I will update if anything changes."
4,It will do the job,what can I say... it is a well designed denim coat. Just as you'd expect from Wrangler... It's a denim coat for a fair price.
5,nice coat right price,The last coat I had for 20 years used it all the time . It kept me warm and dry plus fit very well .So I got a second one .
4,Jacket is good but sizing description could be better,Usually I'm wearing L-size but this one was too short (sleeves too). It is not for tall people.I had to resell it to my friend.
5,Great jacket,"The jacket is great, only complaint is that button holes are too tight for the buttons. The price is fantastic!!!"
4,Honey really liked it.,My man really liked it. He had a very worn out Jean Jacket and we could not find one around here. I looked on line and this one looked so much like his old one (without the holes)that I had to get it. He now can't wait for spring to wear it.
1,Wrong Size,From your records you should have noticed that I returned the item almost immediately due to my ordering the wrong (XL) size! You acknowledged the reciept of the retuned item...
5,Just Perfect,Husband says it is just as comfy as can be (couldn't get it off him for a week!). Liked it so much I bought another.
4,Try it; You'll love it lots of fun,"This game is lots of fun whether you play with 2 players or with friends. I was new to the game (a friend of mine had it - we played and I loved it). Very intertaining and lots of laughs at times. I recommend the game highly. It IS lots of fun. This special edition (Anniversay) is very very nice. You have a very nice cover for your main board, the case is really nice. I love it, you can take care of this easily the way it's packed (with the case, cover for the board and slots for the chips) and play and keep it for years to come. Try it you'll have hours of fun! You could even have it to hand down to your children, very nice set I can't say it enough. It's worth every penny!!!"
2,Not my thing,This book did not grab my attention and I had a hard time finishing it because it was uninteresting to me.
3,Sad doll book.,"This is the author's mother's story of having to flee Hitler's Germany, leaving everything behind, including her beloved doll Elisabeth. The illustrations are beautiful but have the emotional reserve and distance of the text itself, and the improbable happy ending does not ring true. The whole story is too sad, and children of the picture-book age do not need to be introduced to the historical horrors of the world in order to grow up as compassionate people. It is hard to imagine a child of the target audience having this as a favorite book; adults, yes, and maybe very traumatized children, but parents should read it before deciding if it is appropriate for their own kids."
5,A personal connection to the WWII era written with language simple enough for a child to understand.,"The magic of the ending is even more fascinating knowing that the story is true! I read this book once when I was teaching, then let it slip from my memory. Not remembering the title, I have had to search for years to find it again. It contains a wonderful message of hope."
4,Se ve mejor en la fotografía,"Entre sus virtudes, está que es bastante liviano y sobrio. Se carga incluso con la luz de una ampolleta fluorescente de 20Watt. Tiene un perfil delgado, lo que lo hace muy cómodo para el uso diario."
1,Buggy Product,"Have now returned my second unit...this time for a refund.Unit 1: DVD did not workUnit 2: Recording from camcorder i.link worked about 80% of the time. When I stopped the recording the unit froze and I would have to re-record the section. Of course the available recording time of the DVD disk was reduced like the item was recorded. After numerous times I got tired of this and sent the unit back. Additionally, I would add titles to the thumbnails and lock them, then they would disappear.E-mailed Govideo customer service and got no response."
3,"a cute, simple short story","If you want something easy to read and you have a small amount of time to fill, this short story would fit the bill. After spending several years in Paris, a young lady (Elizabeth) returns to the United States by steamship. Her father meets Elizabeth in New York, is introduced to a man who had noticed Elizabeth on the passage to America, they all travel to California by train, the two young people fall in love, and there begins the trouble. I do admit that Elizabeth's fiance was quite clever in the way he trys to blackmail his mother. It's a sweet short story with some twists and turns thrown in to keep up the suspense. I enjoyed reading the story but I don't know if I'll ever get around to reading it again. Too many other books to experience, if you know what I mean :)posted by Poor Richard's wyfe"
1,Shouldn't be sold anymore,"Unless you're in the market for a history book, this guide should be taken off the market. It's outdated at this point in time and doesn't serve as any kind of relevant reference. The laws in Colorado changed a LOT in 2008 regarding rental property. Don't purchase anything before that time, or you're wasting your money."
3,Eh somewhat entertaining,Not bad for a few moments in the life of JimTom and friends and friends and friends......standard craziness you expect.
1,Still Making Moonshine,It is not at all what you think.. If you are trying to learn about making moonshine this movie is not for you at all. Big waste of money
2,okay phone ruined by serious flaw,"I bought the Nokia 2366i to replace a 3 year old Samsung sch a650. I'm a truck driver and use my cell phone a lot. And I ran my old Samsung into the ground. Never a great phone, but a somewhat solid ol' workhorse nonetheless. It finally broke in two on me - literally.But what a big mistake my recent Nokia 2366i replacement purchase was. I cannot hear the incoming call ringer. On the very highest setting it is extremely difficult to notice an incoming call. I've tried all ringer settings on the highest possible level. No satisfaction. I guess the best solution to this problem is to make a habit of picking up the phone every 10 minutes or so to determine whether a call has come in. Or just simply get another phone - which is what I plan to do.What I percieve to be an overall solid, functional phone is ruined by such a simple glitch. What they were thinking when they released this product is beyond me.Hope this review helps.Will"
2,Needs a louder external speaker,"This phone is a nice basic flip phone in all respects except one. I cannot hear it ringing unless it is in my hand already. I usually carry it in my purse and end up missing all my calls. Yes, I have tried different ring tones and have turned up the volume all the way, but it is still too quiet. Unless you live and work in a bank vault, stay away from this phone!"
1,Worst Cell Phone I've ever owned,"This Phone is awful. Short battery life, and an inaudible incoming call ring. Don't purchase it, I would not recommend this to anyone even my worst enemy."
3,"Some great insights, if you have the patience.","This book is an in-depth discussion of the meaning of church architecture from a laymans (lay woman's, in this case)perspective. As Visser points out, someone on the ""inside"" of a faith--in her case, Christianity-- does tend to have insights into the meaning of its traditions that an outside observer might not. This book is full of little insights that are just astounding at times. However, Visser tends to wax poetic on the glories of Christianity every third sentence or so, which makes reading this book for the purpose of studying architecture more of a crapshoot and less of a solid learning experience. By all means, if you need a reinforcement of why your Christian faith is so amazing, get this book. If you want a good in-depth discussion of Christian architecture without having to sit through a sermon, this is probably not the book for you."
3,"Very nice, but not really a book on architecture...","I agree with with the other reviewers about the lack of diagrams and pictures. Since the text is supposed to address the architecture of churches, it needs graphics. Moreover, it lacks rigor in defining how the programmatic elements of a church influence the form of the architecture, and instead focuses on religious history. This book should be in the religious studies section, not architecture."
3,"More Church, Less Sermon, Please","This could have been a terrific guide to absolutely everything in the fine old Roman church of Sant'Agnese fuori le Mura, but instead it bogs down in mystical meanderings and fifth-rate philosophizing. These aspects of the book might be of interest to those who actually believe such things, but for me it just produced eye-rolling. I found myself skimming page after page and saying impatiently to the author, ""Will you please just get on with it!"" There's a great guidebook to Sant' Agnese in there somewhere, but the information is buried among all the other pious maundering that bloats the book to over 250 pages. There are enough footnotes and a long enough bibliography that this could almost be a PhD dissertation! The only way it would be of any use as a guide book would be to go through it with a highlighter, and mark the passages of relevance to the church itself, while ignoring the interminable sermonizing."
4,Well written story of family disfunction and coping.,I found this to be a very realistic story of dealing with a parent who has dementia and how the three sisters dealt with sharing the care of a parent who was difficult even before the dementia began. I look forward to other books by Delia Ephron.
2,Like dragging out a root canal,"This is as good an argument for mercy killing as I've come across. Before the novel even reached the half-way point I just wished the protagonist's ""dwindling"" father would just get it over with and die already. The premise of three sisters dealing with a dysfunctional and dying father held a lot of promise, but the authors attempt at execution was just that...deadly dull. Skip this book and spend a few extra hours with your own father if you can."
3,"A good beach book, but the characters are a too whiney","Overall, I enjoyed Hanging Up. It's a story of three sisters in a wildly disfunctional family. They communicate pretty much exclusively by phone, mostly over the condition of their increasingly senile father. It was very entertaining at times, but for the most part the oldest and youngest sisters are too self involved, and the middle one is a complete doormat for her father, sisters, and son. There is a bitter tone throughout the novel, yet I still had a hard time putting it down."
2,Superficial sit-com characters quipping and whining.,"This book disappointed me twice. First, when I slogged through the book itself, thinking it would have to improve; second, when I found out it will be a Meg Ryan movie. Lucky for the author, she's the sister of Nora Ephron. If anyone else wrote it, it would never have gotten published. It reads like a treatment for a Meg Ryan movie, which will probably be adorable. But you certainly don't need to READ it."
1,Shudder to think,"I have to say that this is very possibly the only book I have ever read in which I detested every single character: Eve, the self-absorbed doormat; Georgia, the self-absorbed career woman; Maddy, the self-absorbed ""actress""...and the list continues with the parents, the spouses, the children...the only reason I want to see the movie is to see how irritating the characters are on screen--or how much they were changed by the screenwriter."
2,not special in this catagory,this books learns the children the abc. it's not in a very special way. they just give the letters with a picture standing next to it. To bad that there isn't a story with it. the pictures are just dick bruna. they are just great.
2,Epergne Collector,"98% of this book is devoted to English, Stourbridge Epergnes. There is only 1 American Company mentioned, Fenton, with very limited photos. This book is ONLY helpful if you collect English Epergnes, there are lots of beautiful photos of these. I wanted to see more American Glass Companies represented."
5,Fantastic Learning Tool for Your Child!!,"This product allowed my stepchildren (who had missed TWO YEARS of school) to catch up and graduate with their class. Due to a case of parental kidnapping, they were out of school for two years and by using this CD and home schooling them AFTER regular school hours were completed, they were at the top of their class! I strongly recommend it for anyone who wants to make sure their children have an excellent education--I used it to brush up on my Trig for a board exam and it's very easy to use!"
3,Not actually new,"I received this mixer today and was a bit disappointed to find that it's not actually new or in a factory sealed container. It had apparently been opened and the mixer itself was even dirty. I'll be contacting this vendor for possible return and refund. I'm not sure at this point if it was used or reconditioned or exactly what I was sold, but for $130 and claims that it was new, I had sort of expected that."
5,eek a mouse is the truth!!,"my fav reggae artist ever!! eek is a legend!!check out ""noahs ark"", ""wild like a tiger"", damn just peep the whole cd!!!!"
2,This is only a soap opera,"This video is composed purely of dramatical reenactments. It's maybe 10% actual science and explanations, 20% interviews, and 70% soap opera. Literally, a daytime soap opera. More of a history lesson than a science lesson, I learned very little. I also sensed that many historical liberties were taken and thus a lot of fiction was injected into the video. Do yourself a favor and skip out on this. Opt for another Einstein video.P.S., This is the same DVD found in the NOVA Genius 4-DVD Collection Series."
1,How NOVA messed up a great Idea,"""Einstein's Big Idea"" by NOVA is a very well produced video giving the necessary background to the meaning of Einstein's formula e=mc2 and how Einstein arrived at this formula. I rate it top notch, however for those of us who are used to quality DVD this is not the case for the disk supplied by NOVA. It is a disk in DVD format but not in DVD quality. If you are willing to settle for second best then this is for you. My recommendation: Don't buy."
5,Best for Hypnotherapy,"The most effective music I have ever used in my 13 year practice. -- S., hypnotherapist"
3,not great,"Half this cd is Perry, half is King Tubby..no, the 2 are not working together on this disc...The tracks are decent, but the misleading of the fan into thinking Perry and Tubby are working together is wrong!The connection between the 2 is Congo's singer Watty Burnett, who recorded with both Perry and the King.Do not be fooled by the cover- the cd is Burnett recording with Perry, Burnett recording with Tubby, but none of the tracks feature Tubby and Perry working together."
2,blah,"Besides one or two nice tracks and four or five hideous tracks, this album is rather boring. Most of this stuff is coming from Watty Burnett (I beleive) who sang with the Congos (now that's good music!) Don't be tricked into thinking this will be as good."
4,A good comforter,My son is a huge spiderman fan and he loves this comforter. It is good quality and has worn well.
3,Spiderman Comforter,I should have listened to the other mothers! Not the comforter as pictured by Target. Amazon.com was amazingly great on the return: simply/fast/postage sticker emailed to me!! I finally found the comforter as pictured at another website.
5,Decking for the Algebra wiz in you,"VR 2.0 is a definite must for any campaign incorporating deckers, and FASA's views of it greatly reducing the time matrix runs take (everyone who uses the old system has rented a flic while the decker is navigating through rough diagrams that look like crumpled spiders) are just. However, the amount of setup (beforehand) time in character creation is greatly increased, and a decent eratta sheet has yet to be published. Start bringing that calculator to gaming groups..."
1,I wish you love,I wanted to here a sample of it on the amazon.com but couldn't and it kept asking me if I had listened to it. There was no way or option to be able to listen to it.
1,I wish you love,"I agree with the other reviewer. I cannot audition the album, therefore I cannot give tell if it is what I'm looking for or not."
1,Useful only to a Manager (not to engineers),"This book does not lie when it says *primer*. It get's 5 stars in its ability to barely skim all the major aspects of embedded linux. The only people who could possibly get any use out of this would be the project manager who needs to briefly get the 5000 foot view of an embedded linux system. Even then, the incomplete code examples only serve as frustration, and the generalizations take too much liberty.NOTE1: This book will *not* help you get your embedded Linux system working. But if you're married to a person whose trying to do this, and you want to be able to some-what understand what they're working on, then this is the book for you.NOTE2: It says PRIMER, and it means PRIMER."
5,Invaluable Resource for in-depth research,"Eric Sundquist's book is an invaluable resource for information when trying to understand the background of Invisible Man. This is the place to start if you're doing research on the novel. Not only does Sundquist present the prolific sources that Ellison used and referenced through the novel, the editor also provides additional resource materials for each reference. It's wonderful if you're writing a research paper, and helpful for the curious reader who wants to be even further convinced of Ellison's genius."
5,"Has sections on Kinematics/EM, mechanics and math.","Would highly recommend it as grounded in the real world. Experiments are done to verify information about the universe, vs. theories which may acquire a life of their own. Phipps has a good sense of humor also, as in his example of Thomas Precession. That is, why does the rim of a spinning disk not lag with respect to its interior as by special relatively? My interest especially is in the invariant versus covariant Maxwell equations, described well by Phipps."
4,"Honest, Insider Perspective","Candor is refreshing in any work because it let's an audience member identify with the vulnerability of the process being described. In this case the process is producing, marketing, and seeking acceptance of a script for a visual medium of communication. Professor Friedmann shares his successes, but he doesn't ignore his failures. Failure is part of the road to success in any endeavor. The only person who hasn't failed is the one who hasn't attempted anything of significance. In this insider account, we're given a look at the various markets and media forms available for aspiring writers.The accompanying CD is a bonus. It is full of ancillary material that adds enormous depth to the explanations described in the book. Anyone interested in pursuing scriptwriting will learn a lot from this book."
1,1 star for the ideas....,"...because they are, of course, hopelessly muddled. But 5 stars for the effort. The very best thing the left can do is assert itself unapologetically; when they do so, they lose. The curious thing is that the left believes, perversely, that their past success was an era of open progressivism to which they must return. More power to them! The truth is, of course, that their past successes depended exclusively on manipulations and sleights-of-hand that have finally been unraveled. The emperor, now naked, is flatly and consistently rejected; those of us thankful for this fortunate turn cannot be more pleased to see the left so clueless as to believe that the trick is to assert said nakedness proudly!Have at it. Buy the book. Advance your ideas. Be strong and proud. There is honor in going down with the ship. You must not allow your ideas and principles to be compromised merely because they are being relegated, rightly, to the dustbin of history. Howard Dean indeed!"
2,Not helpful,"As a web-developer in the process of setting up a cyber-store I found this book quite inadequate. It covers the relevent topics - shopping carts, credit cards, ISPs, etc. but it never addressed any of my basic questions. I never got anything(idea, advice, tip) that I could apply to my cyber-store. I had to refer to many other books."
3,Broke,After a few days of use the magnet kept cracking and breaking. I kinda wasted some money. It does not last very long.
3,they are strong but....,"they break! they are really strong but they break easily i do not reccomend buying these they are junk, they chip they dont last long at all"
3,"good, but not great","I should have gotten a bigger size I guess, these were not strong enough for the frag rack I intended to use them for."
3,Smooth Jazz Ska,"The sound on this record is Jamaican Ska. However, this album is to Jamaican music what Kenny G is too jazz. Do yourself a favor and get a Jazz Jamaica record. Or better yet, get the originators of the style. The Skatalites."
5,This is friggin' SEXY!!!,"This poster is perfect for my dorm room. It is nice and big. I have a wall of black and white prints of figures I adore, and Iggy was a wonderful addition to the collection."
1,Torch sucks,My torch made 2 good creme brulees. It has burned the rest. The flame will not adjust and it quickly dies. I am very disappointed.
5,Herb Master cd/ not what I really expected,"I would have like to have pictures of the various plants with this cd. There is a lot of information concerning symptons and various things you can use to help packed into this cd but it is not what I was really looking for. If I had seen a sample on line I would not have ordered it; however, it is what the company said it was so the 5 star is for company service and a 3 star would be for the actual product itself."
2,"Interesting, but unproven","A recent measurement of Michelangelo's David found that it was 3 feet shorter than originally reported--and this after nearly 500 years of study of this sculpture.Likewise, it could be that Old Master artists, who did employ apprentices that did much of the work, could have used camera obscura techniques to reproduce scenes (this was a proven technique in Italy, when the pinhole camera was invented), but it could also be that they had excellent, nearly photo-realistic, talents, which is routine for any decent artist (Michelangelo used to insist a prospective artist draw a perfect circle by freehand as a test of his skill). So, all in all, an unproven hypothesis, much ado about nothing, not unlike the claim, which is more probable, that Shakespere was a fraud and figment of an English nobleman's imagination."
2,Mixed Emotions,"I too bought the book with an open mind to see what it was all about after having read an article about it in the NY Times. My opinion? At least the reproductions are beautiful - as another reviewer said ""cut out the reproductions and throw away the rest of the book"". I neither agree nor disagree with the author's argument, only - what's the point? I have seen contemporary portraits done to a photographic likeness without the aid of a ""camera"", so who's to say the old masters weren't capable of doing the same? Interesting thesis, but not worth the price of the book."
1,Just one more thing,"I use to paint advertising signs with a projector, you have to work quick since the light source is constantly changing due to heat and this was electric. If you use the sun, it must have been almost impossible to paint this detailed in this minimum of time... just a thought..."
5,Amazing book.,"This book is amazing in so many ways, and I'm frankly pretty bedazzled why some would rate it low when his arguments are pure facts and all of them can be checked for accuracy by anyone with internet access. It helps to see the accompanying video where Hockney, who isn't the greatest draftsman, is able to produce an incredibly lifelike portrait upside down by a camera obscura, that alone should be enough to show how much merit his arguments have. Thoroughly enjoyed the book and so should you if you are interested in how old masters were able to create lifelike portraits with camera obscura."
4,An alternative art history,If I understand it correctly Hockney's hypothesis is that optical instruments like the camera lucida have strongly influenced the development of art over the ages. I found it a fascinating read and his conclusions very interesting. I'm not particularly interested in art history but found this account really insightful. He builds a very strong visual case for his ideas. Well worth a read.
1,"Those who can't , whine about those who can.","Mr. Hockney should be embarrassed by his claims. If he thinks the old masters work is so good because they used tools, he is sadly misguided. If that were the case, Mr. Hockney's art would surpass that of the old masters, given the technology available today. Reading this book is akin to listening to a whiny, jealous child."
4,new knowledge in context,"Hancock's book serves to infuse new information into the complex body of knowns in the assassination. By giving data on the Cuban players involved in Dallas, New Orleans, and Mexico City, he has brightened the landscape and given perspective to other writers and researchers. I have been of the belief that the assassination and the cover up were not necessarily controlled by the same people. This work seems to reinforce that belief. It is a breath of fresh air for me as a reader to see part of the puzzle more clearly defined without claiming to have solved the whole mystery, which is the onus of most researcher/writers. A good read that should be on the shelf of every serious researcher."
1,Terrible editing of the Kindle edition,"The copyediting for this book is atrocious. Font sizes change for no reason, headlines and titles wildly change case, page boundaries run over, the table of contents is not hyperlinked. These are problems I have noticed in reading the first ten pages. I refuse to pay $12.50 for a book that is not professionally presented and edited. I have had it with terribly edited e-books and am returning this one."
1,Three ways to keep a secret,"First, some did talk. They, too, were assassinated. Second, the assassins were talking, but not in English. Foreign hitmen were hired. Third, those with power and influence who knew the truth were afraid to speak because Establishment pressure on the media would have ended their careers in short order."
2,wrong language,TO RETURN THIS BOOK AS i WAS NOT TOLD WHEN i ORDERED IT THAT IT WAS IN sPANISH. i REQUESTED IT IN eNGLISH AND WAS TOLD IT WAS NOT AVAILABLE. i HAVE TO ASSUME SINCE THE WRITER IS aUSTRAILIAN IT WAS WRITTEN IN eNGLISH
1,Another Sopranos ripoff,Charles Stella writes like another goombah wannabe. His storyline was amatuerish and the prose was child like. The only thing positive about this book is it reaffirms the theory that if a hundred monkeys banged on a typewriter for 10 years that they would eventually recreate a Shakesperean play. Now that I think about it Stella actually disproves that theory.
1,keep,Eddie's world was a stinker. Charles Stella needn't give up his day job. The plot is unbelieveable like a Nickolodeon cartoon.The book started well until I reached chapter one.
4,First in a series which gets more entertaining,"First of all, if you're new to Charlie Stella, this is the place to start. His books overlaps loosely, and reading them out of order is going to cause you to read many spoilers you don't want.Eddie's world shows a bit of roughness around the edges. As his works mature, he gets his timing down much better and becomes more adept at telling a fast paced story from multiple points of view.That said, there is a lot to admire here. He sets up the dramatic tension between the protagonist and his wife quite well, and things just explode from there. The villains are amoral, the 'heroes' are ambiguous as hell, and the dilemmas they get themselves in are often tragi-comedic. As with later works, conflicts between various police agencies are rendered with a high sense of irony.Stella will get a better ear for dialog as his career progresses, but his command of street patois is already ahead of the vast majority of his contemporaries. This is a very enjoyable read."
5,My First Crime Novel from the Other Side. John Skeene...,"Mr. Stella's style develops in this interesting and moving crime novel. You have a feel for the characters and how gaming and gritty the top layer of the crime underworld can be. I could not put it down. A good read and I cannot wait for the sequel which is out by the time you read this. Eddie is a likable guy, a married man deciding to take one last shot for that lifetime payoff but gets caught-up in the quest when things can go so wrong and people are hurt. The rollers; (cops), apply pressure and the Russians have their own way of doing things. A ex-con bent on greed, treachery and betrayal, added to the mix with unpredictability will have you turning the page to see how the event takes place. A very good read."
1,Zombies Unleashed,"Although I do love ""no budget"" horror movies, it is always interesting to see how creative wanna be film makers ca be with a good story, decent acting, interesting shot angles, and sharp creative editing, Zomies unleashed has none of that. Amazon should be ashamed to peddle this garbage for even $1.99. Waste of money and time.It can be fun to watch a bad movie, but at no time while watching this trash will you even feel like yuo""re watching a real movie. It looks like some ""no talent"" friends got together to play with a cheap old camcorder. P.U!!! stay away. - Zero stars, I want a refund."
5,Somerled: Hammer of the Norse,This is the best history of Somerled I have read! I have read seven others and this is the first author to examine all of the conflicting source materials and present them to the reader to draw their own conclusion. The other historians seemed to discedit Clan Donald histories about their ancestor and except the writings of Somerled's adversaries as gospel. This author presented both sides and added her perspective on reasons for the conflicting accounts. She showed faith that her reader could draw logical conclusions if empowered with all of the information. The reader is immediately aware that this author is presenting Somerled from the perspective of a Highlander. Thank you Kathlene MacPhee for this unique perspective on our ancestor.
4,More of a History Book,"I read the other reviews and was excited, as a descendant of Somerled, to read more about my great, great, great .... Grandpappy. I found the book more like a history book. In between some of the `history stuff' were some very interesting stories about boat building (an important part of that life) and alliances to other families. The book is divided into three parts. Part I gives you some background of life prior to Somerled. Part II is on the Kingdom of Argyll and the Isles, which I was unfamiliar with. Part III is about The Ships. Somerled is really only discussed in Part II between pages 53-91. I was hoping for a little more insight. Overall, well worth a 15 bucks."
3,Bernard Shaw's The Millionairess DVD,"I've always been a huge fan of Maggie Smith, and she is wickedly good as Epifania Ognisanti di Parerga Fitzfassenden, The Millionairess. Jeez, what a mouthful. My complaint, which doesn't entirely spoil the film, is the mediocre quality of the BBC production. The sound is a trifle off, and it feels like it's taking place on an echoey stage, which it is. Having said that, Maggie's performance is tremendous, and almost overcomes the spotty production."
5,Excellent production,"This is an excellent production. If you are at all interested in this, I recommend getting ""The Shaw Collection"" DVD set instead. These are a series of televised BBC ""Play of the Month"". The production values aren't always top-notch, but the acting is typically quite good. The direction and sets are very stage-like as opposed to a TV or cinema movie.This would be more enjoyable for Shaw, literature, or theater fans than your average public. Maggie Smith does a fantastic job. The rest of the cast is excellent. I haven't read the play so I don't know if anything was changed. The first time I tried watching it, I fell asleep several times. The next time I watched it I was glued to the screen."
3,Maggie is Magnificent,First I want to say that the DVD came promptly and in great condition.The movie was fun and I adore Maggie Smith. It was fun to see her at an earlier age than when she played in Harry Potter.
4,The Millionairess - DVD,"Maggie Smith is great in this film. The story isn't one of the best I've seen, but her performance is spectacular, as she always is !!!"
3,"""Low key"" DVD!","Entertaining but very low key! Pleasant way to just 'while away the time', needs little concentration. However, I enjoyed it. It would probably appeal more to older folks than the younger generation."
1,positively ghastly!,"The only reason I bought this was because of Maggie Smith... but this has to be the most ghastly production the BBC has ever created. Maggie must have been desperate for employment to have taken on such a shabby, tasteless, idiotic, inane show as this. It has the hollow, one room approach you might see in a stage play but no sane person would be able to watch this terrible show from start to finish.It is so bad, the DVD is not even useful as a cup coaster.I have thousands of movies in my collection and this one rates with the bottom 3 worst movies imaginable... which are not even worthwhile of being listed as part of the collection. Perhaps the British can tolerate this tripe but I don't know of too many on this side of the pond who could.Save your money. There are other movies with Maggie Smith which would be worthwhile to buy."
2,Poorly written play,"I order two copies of The Millionairess - one for myself and one for a gift. After watching it, I was too embarassed to give it as a gift. The play is simply poorly written and not up to the standard I've come to expect from English comedy. There are a couple of clever lines here and there but it drags on and on. Maggie Smith is a brilliant actress but even she couldn't save it."
2,The Millionairess-less is better !,"""The Milionairess"" is a stage play that did not translate well onto the silver screen. The filming was done many years ago and the acting is ""over-the-top"" to the point of haming-it-up. The story line is good, but presented in a somewhat hysterical and at times almost frenzied style. As a stage play it would have been good, but as a film, I do not recommend unless you are interested in the history of theatre and acting. I do not think G.B. Shaw would have been pleased with this production. The typical British humour seems lost in the frenzy of the acting."
1,Terrible Movie,I am a big movie buff and have hundreds I have collected. This one is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever attempted to watch. I got about a half hour into it and took it out. Absolutely boring.
1,Very Disappointed,"The BBC usually produces excellent movies and television series. This was not the case with the Millionairess. This was a very low budget movies, without any story-line. The acting was poor. I normally keep my DVD's to view for a second or third time, I gave this one to the Salvation Army. This movie should not be sold, it should be given away free of charge."
2,Tasteless and bland,I love lemon cookies but was disappointed to find these lemon cookies tasteless and bland. Very disappointed.
4,Endless Summer,"Great quality deck!! I've owned only one better quality deck by Fibreflex. The deck is flat with nice flex & built in grip....I've had to send one major brand deck back 3 times because it was so badly tweeked (one of the wheels didn't touch the ground )If your sick of those China longboard decks with filler & ""footballs"" (knots that are filled in)You'll be ""surfprized"" with this RA !! .I even got Free shipping ! :) ""Wood"" have got 5 stars if the stringers were real (silkscreened) & a 48"" version for cross stepping would be sweet!"
4,My brother loved this,I bought this for my brother and he said that he absolutely loves it. The only confusion I had was that I was expecting the full board (including the tracks and wheels) as I was going off some of the pictures included.
4,its good but i think it can be more flexible,"I like this deck, its nice and long...good for dancing on. My only complaint is that the flex in this board seems...too stiff. Definitely not as fun with it this stiff but other than that, good quality and a good buy for beginners. I find going downhill with randal 150's on this deck a bit unstable so I recommend something wider."
3,Wrong Size,The shoes looked better on the web but are still ok. The main problem I have is that the wrong size was delivered to my house. I have not returned them yet b/c I have not had time and do not want to pay to return them. I will probably end up just giving them away.
4,"Cute, but hard to read","This is a cute chart...I like that it is wooden. But when you try and mark it you end up have to go back and use a black permantant marker and go over what you did just to see the height. I'm using to record my four kids, and compare each of them at the same age. It's getting pretty full!"
2,Not very impressed.,"I love Melissa and Doug stuff for our son, so I was happy they had something that fit in with our dinosaur theme in his room. This growth chart is made of wood and is hinged. It doesn't lay flat against the way, which really annoys me. I've tried sticky tack, but that didn't work. I think we'll have to try nailing it at several spots to get it to lay flat. Also, it comes with stickers so you can put your child's name on the chart. These peel off really easily, and if you have a little boy like we do, he made quick work of taking them off himself. I tried to adhere them well and I may end up using some decoupage medium to get them to stay on. This chart was a lot cheaper than others I'd seen. Unfortunately you get what you pay for."
4,Lair of bones,"It was a very good book, I love the Runelords, and had been waiting to read it for a while. The conclusion was nice, but Farland seemed like one of those authors that panics at the end, because the aftermath area felt rushed. It was still a very good book."
4,Over so soon?,The last(?) book in the series. There are a few threads that seemed to be glossed over but the main part of the story is pretty good. Gaborn finally gets to the Reavers and the true enemy is revealed. He ends the story of the invasion of the Reavers but leaves the possibility for more. I give it a B/B- on the StuPage Reviews.
4,A Fitting Conclusion to an Original Series,"I picked this book up just recently, after going back and re-reading the first three. Like one of the previus reviewer's said, you aren't re-introduced to characters, so if you've not read Book 3 in a while, you might want to re-acquaint yourself.I finished this book in an afternoon, so it's an easy read. A lot of it seems to include a whole lot of people riding/running around from place to place, but overall, it all connects well in the end.There are a few loose ends that don't get tied up, but if you stop and think about it, you can sort of draw your own conclusions...**SPOILER**I didn't care much for the end...oh it was wrapped up nicely, but I think most people like happy endings and this didn't really deliver there."
4,Book review,Really good story that wraps up the story of the Runelords very well. My opinion is that this book should have had one or two additional chapters to complete the story better and then end the series at that point. The books after this one are rather boring and the only point seems to be to draw out the story into yet another book.
4,Best of the Series,"While the ending may seem rushed, it is actually the kind of fast-paced final conflagration that w have come to expect in fantasy epics. This book was the best of the series - no slow parts and well-defined characters. The book divisions, days, don't always make sense, and certain characters like the enemy leader and Erin seem to be thrown in as an afterthought. Nevertheless, it's an exciting read and I'm glad he wrapped it up in four volumes instead of dragging it out forever Jordan-style. Will there be more? I don't know but there is plenty of opportunity for follow-up."
2,complete disappointment...,"By the time I finished this book I was trying to convince myself that the other books in this series must've been better than this... this utter waste of time! The poor editing, abrupt ending and subpar pacing were enough to wreck the story. But the way that the series ending seemed to be more of an afterthought, than part of a larger cohesive idea. I'm still wandering what happened to several of the subplots that were just forgotten, or ignored in an effort to just end things. Its' one thing to leave loose ends for future books, its another to just drop a plot or character completely. FRUSTRATING. that word pretty much somes up this experience."
3,It's over? Really!? ...well I'll be darn.,"A fantasy series that actually ends. Oh my.But I feel like Farland wanted out of the whole thing. This book, although entertaining is a cursory attempt at what the previous novels have led up to. It's an ending however unfulfilling. If you read the series, buy this book, read it, and put it to rest. Runelords could have been great..."
2,What The *^&%#!+?**$!,"There is all this talk out there about Authors drawing out the story line longer than it should be. I won't name the two that released this year. Well that's not the problem here. I liked the story, the action, the Hero's dedication. But, if there ever was a story that needed to be stretched it was this one. I like the book for what it was. David Farland was sick of writing and tried to wrap it up in short order. He left alot of things unanswered,unfinished and unsaid."
5,"Quick, enjoyable reading","This was my first Kindle book and I really enjoyed it! I have read the other books in the series and found this one to be just as enjoyable as the others. If you have enjoyed the series so far, you will not want to miss this one."
4,"Worth Reading, Abrupt Conclusion","Good story in a world with very interesting magical lore. The climax is rather abrupt and the conclusion rather weak. There are many characters you are left wondering what happened to: what happened to the army coming from the south, where is Daylan Hammer, what exactly is happening with the remaining evil spirit. I guess that is fodder for another book. Overall still a book of this genre."
3,Ehh,"The book is ok, the story just kind of ends. All through out the series there is a lot of tension and back story that builds. Unfortunately the final book does'nt deliver with many of the plot threads coming to unsatisfactory and rather shallow endings."
3,Slight improvment over #3 though not by a lot,"I don'y know who is too be held resonsable for this mess of a book but they should be shot. I for one am blaming the editor becuase there is no way the author who gave us the first two installments of this serise could have knowingly contrbuted to the fourth.It is one of those books that is not exactly good and not exactly bad the fact remains that you can skip whole chapters and really not miss one secound of the action. The previous reviewers are right it is almost as if David Farland grew sick of writting the book, it doesn't so much end as just stop.As resultQuestions that all readers have are never anseweredCharecters from previous books are just forgotenAfter waiting 4 books for the final resolution between good and evil the final showdown happens much too easily.Overall-The main moral of this story seems to be"
1,Zero stars would be more appropriate,"Ugh. I had such high hopes for this series when it first started. Great premise, great ideas, just needed a more technically sound writer, or better editors. Didn't matter in the long run, however, as nothing could save this last book. Guy Gavriel Kay, Steven Erikson and George Martin couldn't save this book. Pity too, because now my view of the first book is lessened by having read this hopefully last book in the series.Other people have summarized the characters well enough and frankly, each one to an eyelash is dreadfully boring, or became boring after the first book. Even Raj is a dullard. Maybe it is because there isn't a law of diminishing returns on endowments... I wish Farland had taken an endowment of restraint and not written this book."
4,Nice Break from Endless Epics,"Yes, the other reviews were right in that it has a very abrupt ending, and the final chapter has a pace that leaves the reader wanting an endowment of metabolism, but there IS an end. How many fantasy series coming out of the '90s can say that? The pace leaves the characters a little less developed than I would have preferred, but not so much so that you can't cheer for them. I was pleased with this book for its intense action and closure (I'm not saying more isn't forthcoming, but this story line is done)."
2,Disappointing end to a pretty good series,"I echo the comments of most of the other reviewers. Farland obviously lost all interest in this particular book. Way too abrupt of an ending, and so many details left unattended. A real disappointment to what I considered a pretty good series overall. Oh, and the editing was horrible. Numerous mistakes that jump out at you."
4,Informative,"This book was informative, but somewhat basic. For the average christian I would highly recommend this book. Most christians seem to avoid the Old Testament because they believe it almost doesn't matter. This book is a good source to show what the old testament is and what it means. I would recommend this book to any christian seeking to learn more and is seeking to grow more with God."
4,Pony Pc game review,"I purchased this game for my 4 year old daughter. She was very pleased with the game although it ends a little too soon for her, but she enjoys playing it repeatedly. The little pony that came with the game was an added and welcome bonus. The game installed very easily and has not given me any problems. I received the game in the mail quite promptly. I am very satisfied with every faucet of this purchase."
5,Outstanding,I saw the show in L.V. NV.& thought the whole show was great especially the music.The performers were terific! We need more shows like this to keep the music alive! I am trying to buy the cd and video but can't seem to find it. Can you help? Thank you
5,BUDDY HOLLY'S MUSIC WILL NEVER DIE!,"I fpurchased this item a few weeks ago, and I thought to my selfThey will do a pretty good job, and boy I was wrong it was FANTASTIC."
1,Don't buy this POS regulator,"Less than a month after installation, this regulator failed in a spectacular manner, gushing fuel out of the adjuster knob base. Yes, I was using this with a mechanical fuel pump as the manufacturer intended.I was extremely lucky that my car did not burn to the ground."
1,wrong video sent in error,"I requested the Burt Lancaster/ Kirk Douglas edition, yhey sent me this. I agree that this edition has fine actors but, it is not what I wanted. Almost qualify as SF, based loosely on the wizard of OZ"
3,okay,"This was superbly acted, as are things Patrick Stewart is in. It was a bit boring in spots though."
4,"Great Game, With one minor Flaw","This game is Great. Good graphics, excelent Soundtrack and a Compelling History with interesting characters that will inmerse you very quickly in the war against the Ghestalian Empire. The only problem with the game is that the random battles are extremely continuous and that can be quite exasperating after the 15-20 Hours Mark. However, if you like the RPG's it shouldn't discourage you from playing it because even now, after so many years from the original release it's still a great game."
4,Son of a what?,"This game was amazing back when I first played it and the original charm is FOR THE MOST PART still there. It's one of the greatest stories ever told in my honest opinion, but the new translations lack the punch of the original one. Specifically, if you ever thought ""son of a submariner!"" was the best insult ever fangled, you'll be very disappointed with this new iteration of an old classic.But I'm nitpicking. This is indeed an excellent game if you're into that whole nostalgia thing. I am."
2,Love the game dislike the fact that I CAN'T SAVE!!!,"I've been a big fan of the final fantasy series and this is my 2nd favorite my 1st being FFIX(9). It annoys me though when it states ""great game"" ""plays well"" ""guaranteed to work"" and the first thing that happens is it doesn't work...It took 10 minutes for it to FINALLY load and when I start playing it freezes on me (which happened twice). I then was able to make some progress and 45min in I decided to save it and wouldn't you know it it says ""save file corrupted"". That pretty much says it all."
3,"classic game, only one screen and too small to grind and enjoy","i got this for the bonus dungeon which i havent even done yet.dont mean to complain but the screen is REALLY TINY.thats why i really like the psp, and the newer games for the ds (double screen)this game was made for the gameboy advancebefore the double screen came outand is pretty much the same as the nintendo versionexcept with a bonus dungeon.im not jumping around about it,i would recommend playing the playstation versionon a bigger screen;the tiny amount of new itemsand some new espers arent worth squintingand ruining your eyes."
5,Great conversion of a great game,"You simply can't play this game too many times. The new stuff is a great addition, and the classic game itself is worth far more than Squaresoft charges for it. Buy it now."
5,ANOTHER GREAT ANIME,"This was another great bargain to get most anime dvds cost like 19.95 for just one dvd.This anime was nicely done and well done,having the whole set saves money.Also there is a lot of humor here which is one of the reasons to got these DVDS."
4,"Perfect aide to take action now, and take back your life.","This book was a terrific tool to help me take a look at my panic attacks in a new light. It gave me ideas and options, let me know I am deffinatly not alone...and that there is hope. It's excellent hands on...work at your own pace...self help material. I recommend this book to everyone I know that suffers from anxiety disorders."
5,Ecstasy,"Finally the marriage of beautiful picture with sensible advice. ""At Home with Books"" has a little something for all book lovers and library owners.At first it feels like voyeurism as you rummage through the exquisite pictures of personal libraries. They did not even bother to pick up the clutter. You can not help but relate to the difficulties of where to place books.Later you are given suggestions on how to organize them and a clear warning that no mater how much space you allocated, it is not enough. You see famous and infamous libraries, domestic and exotic. Now you have to put the book down and look for your magnifying glass to see what they are reading.Every aspect is covered from lighting to library design. And thy pull not punches when covering culling out the library."
1,damage to product not described,the content is fine - it is my 2nd copy . I liked it so much this copy was intended to be a gift.I am very disappointed as the description of the used book did not include the fact the spine was detached from the book. Had that been disclosed I would not have purchased the book. It is a large hard copy so the damage is very obvious.this is the first item I have purchased where the description was so misleading.I have as is the way with internet purchases and the already long delay ( no complaint there my choice ) decided not to waste time repackaging and returning and engage in countless emails. That said I am so peeved I have taken the time to do what I rarely do and provide this feedback.
4,Wish There Had Been More to It,"This is a stunning coffee table book for book lovers, particularly people who keep their books. I gave it to myself as I began a huge project that includes rearranging, cleaning and inventorying my books, as well as painting the room and shelves. It was a needed punch in the arm, but be warned that as practical information goes, it is hit and miss. Good advice on deciding what to keep, what to move on; no information on how those people with all those books keep them clean (I don't count the person who had everything slip-jacketed). I would have liked more detailed advice on organizing systems. I wish, too, there had been more variety to the libraries shown, though it was a pleasant surprise to find Keith Richards and writer Roger Rosenblatt in here, the latter perhaps more of a touchstone to us of middle-class abodes than some of the palace-owners profiled. The rooms stacked to ceilings with unshelved books were not an inspiration. That's what I'm trying to run from."
2,Not a book for library design,"All the reviews I read spoke well of this book. I got it assuming I would learn something about library design. Yes, the Getty library is worth emulating (although not for the masses) but the bulk of the home libraries shown were, to my eye, a mess. Since I was expecting something else, this book was a disappointment"
2,Pompous annoying tripe.,"I'm quite certain it was not the fault of the featured celebrities that even as we read of their love of books, one wishes to smack them. No. it is the tone of the writers of the book that makes one wish to scream; moreover, to resell the book as quickly as possible, even though there are habitats shown in the book that are positively entrancing.I prefer the wild intrigue and adventure in Nicholas Basbanes' A Gentle Madness, and letting my books sit where they may."
5,A Book for booklovers!,"If you love books, if you love reading, whether you are a serious book collector, have a small library at home or at the office or even if you have a small shelf full of books at your bedroom you should have this book. With beautiful photographs and well written comments about English Country House Libraries, libraries designed by designers, writers'libraries, book collector's libraries and much more,in At Home with Books you will find visual delights, wonderful readings and a Resource Directory that will inform you about Rare-book dealers shops, Book Fairs, Library furnishing and illumination and more ( with web page directions about those topics)I think that every book owner should have a book like this one, buy it!"
1,Didn't last,"Lasted less than a month, I lost irreplaceable pictures by trusting this card. I have seldom been so disappointed."
2,TOOK OVER A WEEK FOR THEM TO MAIL IT!,"I ordered the ""refurbished"" version from ""Happyezdeals"" for my son in Oregon. I expected him to have lots of pictures for me already, but then I just got an e-mail that they had ""just"" sent it. So I am not a happy camper! Not only that, but the vendor writes: ""I took a great care to give you the best service possible. And I hope that you will evaluate this transaction positively."" Yeah. The price seems very good, and I hope that the card has arrived and works for my son. I'll let you know. In the mean time, I'd advise that you avoid this vendor if you are in a hurry."
5,excellent,"excellent service, inmidiatly i bough it i received the tracking number and only take a few of days to received."
4,Only Olympus cards support Panorama feature,"If you are interested in Panorama feature which is available in many Olympus digital cameras..make sure you buy ""Olympus xD card"".Do not buy Fujifilm or Lexar or other brand.All Olympus Xd Card covers have BOLD letter stating ""Supports Panorama"". Make sure you check that before buying a xD-card."
3,Returning Item xD Picture Card,"I am sure this item will work for anyone who make the purchase. However, it was not the correct item for my old digital camera. The description is misleading and should state 256H xD Picture Card to indicate that this is the newer format and not the initial version of a 256MB xD Picture Card that was offered."
5,Olynpus 256 MB xD Picture Card,I purchased this to use with my Olympus C-50 zoom and have been using it for a couple of weeks now. The performance has been very good and I'm very happy with this purchase.
2,About the same speed as my compact flash but not as reliable,"I use this 256M Xd Olympus for my C5050. taking pictures is good and comparable to the 256M compact flash with about half of the price tag. Ater downloaded the pictures to my computer, the card went poopy!!(card error and cannot be able to reformated) I used the same Sandisk card reader as for my compact flash card! I used the other reader (computer built in), well I fried another 64M Xd fujifilm. Performance may be! but reliable, I don't think so. Giving a 2 is too generous !!!"
5,Great card,"I bought this card as the 16 MB card included with my camera was really not worth using. I have used this card EXTENSIVELY and never had a problem. It writes quickly, transfers quickly and produces top notch images. Highly recommend - it is better than the Fuji xD card."
1,Beware xD memory...,"Thank heavens analogue cameras standardised on 35mm. Just imagine you went into a shop and had a choice of 2inch, 30mm, 25mm, 33mm, 35mm etc films, only one of which would fit your camera. Olympus have done a Sony and repackaged the same old memory chips (e.g. SD, MMC, SM, CF, MD) as xD and decided to sell it at twice the price of SD memory. Once you buy one of their (admittedly good) digital cameras the small xD market will force you to buy expensive memory that is incompatible with almost everything else our there. As I already own some cheap standard SD memory that's not usable in most Olympus cameras, I have had to look elsewhere for a camera :o("
1,"great way to practice, but shouldn't it last?",I got this net and set it up in February and been using it fairly regularly. I was hitting some balls tonight and noticed some tears in the netting much to my disappointment!Shouldn't a $100.00 golf net last longer than 3-4 months?Completely unacceptable.
1,Quality is missing,I received my Cage Net on August 12 06 I set it up on Aug.16.I hit about 50 golf balls into it and one of the tabs that holds the black tarp tore loose.I then noticed that there was a hole in the netting.Where is the QUALITY?
2,Disappointed in Wilson Golf Extreme Cage Net,"I received the net missing a pole which you obviously need to erect the net properly. But I was particularly disappointed in the net and its ability to stop a golf ball. It no more stopped a driven golf ball than drapped toilet paper! Unless you hit the nylon target, you have lost a ball! I may as well hang the nylon target alone from a tree and the results will be the same if I miss the target!"
1,POOR QUALITY.....This Net STINKS!,I bought this net for my son for Christmas. His last golf net lasted 2 years before it ripped. This one lasted 5 months. It is shredding to pieces. Unusable already. Do NOT buy.
1,Fore Get It,"Do not buy this product. We purchased the net for our high school-age daughter this past Christmas and have had it set up for her to practice on. Not only did balls break through the netting after two months of light useage, but the seams where the netting was attached/glued have separated causing the areas between the supports to sag and fall apart. The netting itself is disintergrating. Great idea, poor craftsmanship."
1,Are negative stars possible?,"Possibly the worst product I have ever purchased. I know some have mentioned the poor quality once contructed, but I couldn't even get the thing put together. A combination of poor instructions, mislabled parts, and parts that did not fit prevented even a rudimentary assembly. It is so bad of a product that I am convinced that the 5 star review has to be a company shill. Sadly, I purchased this via clearance so I cannot return it. I am hoping Wilson stands by their product, but I am not holding my breath. AVOID!!!!"
2,disappointing,"I purchased this Golf Net for my husband for Father's Day. Two months later it has dry rotted and full of holes, because it can no longer stop anything that hits it. The Wilson banner and bottom liner still look brand new, as it should, but the net is terrible!I have since requested information regarding a replacement from Amazon [seller], but have had no return correspondence from them. [I've never had any problem with anything I've purchased through Amazon, until now.] Possibly, I will have to go directly through Wilson to have this dealt with. I am very disappointed in the quality of this product."
1,net ripped off,"the right side of net completely ripped off in the course of ordinary use. the teared off area is so large and cannot even try to repair. as noted by other buyers, this product is for 2 months use. not durable..."
1,A setup nightmare,Good luck with installing this. A true nightmare.Still haven't managed to get this thing up andrunning after two day's. Instruction's are not very good.Spend some more and get something that will work.Pure junk.
4,Finally on CD...,"I've owned this LP for years, having given up on ever seeing it on CD. Originally released in 1977, the French-Canadian band's third album finally makes its appearance on CD. Even though my prog-rock days are somewhat behind me, this release from Maneige is a cut above most music of that genre. Imagine Pierre Moerlen's Gong coupled with Jethro Tull minus Ian Anderson's vocals. You get the idea. Prog fans will dig it. The bonus tracks are worthwhile."
3,Great to see people do this on their own!,"It's great to see those who want to create just go out and do it instead of talking about it. It definitly inspired me to write more and work on my own creations. No matter the budget, it's good to see people come together to create their own feature. I had fun!"
1,Waste of Time and Money!,After reading other reviews I decided to give this film a chance. I now wish I didn't. The acting would be considered sub-par even for public access programing and everything else about this film only adds to the heap of a garbage dump that this film is. I couldn't bear sitting through even a third of it. If only negative stars were a rating option.
5,L...I...V...E!,"Broken Teeth had two studio albums under their belt when they decided to record this live record. Apparently, with the help of family & friends, it only cost the band @ $100 to put this cd together. And it rocks from start to finish. It's very rare when a band's live recordings rival their studio efforts or even surpass them. But this happens to be one of those cases.You've got fifteen amazing songs culled from their first 2 releases plus @ least 1 new track. The band is tight. The songs are quick & to-the-point. And McMaster's vocals are outstanding. There's no doubt that he is still one of the best frontmen around. And the fact that he's no longer a 23 yr. old kid is even more remarkable. He's got incredible stamina & energy to burn & his vocals have not suffered at all through the years. Definitely a live record worth picking up. It's also a chance to hear the band with Brett McCormick on bass & the last Broken Teeth record with Paul Lidel on lead guitar. One word...L...I...V...E!"
1,Thank God it was so cheap,"The worst piece of non-stick I have ever used. We have begun replacing our old original calpahlon and have been thrilled with the all-clad up until this junk. Granted it has the core of the the stainless but the non-stick finish has ""varnised"" and as such is useless. We are accomplished cooks and use our pans daily sometimes all of them. Treat them with care and know how to preheat properly steer clear of this pan."
1,Not for Induction cooktops,"Very disappointed that All Clad decided to use non-magnetic stainless steel on this grill pan, which will not heat on an Induction cooktop."
1,Best thing about this book is the title,"Fracis Key Scott Fitzgerald is a good writer, as is demonstrated aptly in the Great Gatsby. This collection of short stories however are nothing short of a disaster. ""The Diamond as Big as the Ritz"" is a prime example of a the strange mishmash style with the story having no real ending. FScott was no short story writer, with most of these stories lead up to no real point or climax. Very disppointed.I give it one star because they're well-written -- but I didn't find them enjoyable."
3,John Douglas's Guide to Careers in the FBI,"I found the book informative in regards to history and examples from former and current agents. However, it did not prepare me for the application process. I actually think it hindered me, in that, I went into certain phases of the process with preconceived notions of what to expect. My expectations were WRONG. I did make it to Phase II before I floundered in the Bureau's eyes. I wish I had found something more informative in detail regarding each phase of the selection process."
2,Poor choice if you want an FBI career,"I agree with ""sackrtaters"" review 100 percent that Douglas' book is a big disappointment. Not only is it geared exclusively to special agent careers, it doesn't provide much useful information and discussion on the hiring process is out of date. ""FBI Careers,"" by Thomas H. Ackerman, is up to date and MUCH more in-depth. It covers special agent careers and the hiring process at length, and also includes info on about 20 other FBI positions and their application processes. Ackerman's book also has great advice on filling out application forms, taking the exams, and passing the interviews. I also recommend ""The FBI: A Comprehensive Reference Guide,"" by Athan Theoharis, for a great overview of the agency and its functions. The Theoharis book is an excellent reference for info on the history and organization of the FBI."
2,Good Information about the FBI but NOT A GUIDE TO EMPLOYMENT,This book serves a good purpose by giving the reader a general history of the FBI and some war stories of some agents. But the title is MISLEADING. Fully 2/3 of this book have nothing to do with a guide to employment with the FBI. The 1/3 which does deal with this subject is almost taken verbatim from the FBI's employment website and consists of generalized statements. Not too much help here.
3,Don't expect inside info,"I bought this one, as well as Ackerman's book. If you're hoping for those little tidbits of inside information to give you a leg up, forget about it. These authors came from the same tight-lipped establishment you're trying to get into, and they're not about to offer any more than is offered on [line]. The Douglas book has no more than 12 pages dedicated to the application/selection process and it's straight from the FBI Web site. If you buy one, I suggest the Ackerman book as it assumes you're already past the ""I'm in high school, so what's this FBI thingy"" stage. It actually has some very interesting information on what to expect after applying, as well as outlines of the different organizations within, e.g. FBI Scuba Team."
2,Title is Misleading.,The title implies multiple careers in the FBI. I was not interested in the special agent process or position and was disappointed to receive information on only the special agent career. This is not a guide to careers in the FBI. It is a guide to A special agent CAREER in the FBI.
2,15 bucks down the drain,"""Guide to Careers in the FBI"" has too many war stories and not enough of the advice you'll need in such a competitive arena. I was hoping for much more substance."
3,Honestly don't waste your money,"This book doesnt tell you all that much. Ten's of thousands of people apply for this job every year. If you have what it takes you'll make it, if you don't this book won't make anything better for you. Also, the FBI updates there hiring procedures pretty regulary and this book is slightly outdated. The shipper was great and the book arrived in good condition."
1,Author is out of his element,"After reading the author's ""Anatomy of Motive"" and ""Mind Hunter"" books, I can tell you that he is a much better storyteller than a career book author. This is unfortunate and disappointing, because his other books are much better written than ""Guide to Careers in the FBI."" It appears that he tried to apply his storytelling style of writing to his career book, and it does not work."
1,save your money,"This looks better in the picture than in real life. The crochet beads are not what I call crochet, but they are round woven balls (not crochet though), and the center yellow ""stone"" is cheap and plastic. A Bead was not intact upon delivery."
3,"Light, gentle use of classic characters","I enjoyed Pride and Prescience, despite it's flaws. The author's respect for Miss Austen and affection for her characters is apparent; I thought she portrayed them nicely. I was nearly put off early on by references to the american character from ""The United States"" or ""The States"" and a few other similarly inapproapriate colloquialisms (Pride and Prejudice was published in 1813; the civil war did not begin until 1861, therefore there was no ""United States""); however I stuck with it and ultimately found this book a light, pleasant and engaging read. I particularly enjoyed the idea of Darcy and Elizabeth as a sleuthing couple, and will certainly give any future books in the series a chance. I don't ever expect much from modern sequels to classic novels, and found this a unique way to revive these wonderful characters."
1,Extremely disappointing at best,"Taking Jane Austen's wonderful characters and plotting this unbelievable mystery is such a grave injustice. Caroline Bingley would never have married an American and taking the mystery into occultic and mysticism is so beneath Mr. and Mrs. Darcy. Changing the ending of the original was not a good choice - everyone wants to know that the Darcy's spent a splendid holiday with friends and family at Pemberley. The author does try to keep up some of the interesting teasing that goes on between the newly married Darcy's, but after the first several chapters that is mostly missing from the story. I think it's better to leave the original alone and allow Jane's characters to stand alone and untouched."
3,Too much attention on Hocus Pocus,"It is lovely to be reconnected with Jane Austen's characters once again as they 'travel' through their lives. The story is well written, true to the period, best I can tell, and develops into a mystery. The focus on the occult is a bit disappointing. Though Jane's character Elizabeth may have been intrigued by the supernatural as many were in that age I doubt she would have given it that much attention and power in the story line and certainly not the conclusion. I did like the book and ordered one other in the series hoping we didn't go all the way down the same track. I have noticed one of the 'prescience' characters reappearing in the next book so we will see how that develops. Personally, I think it is enough to catch up with the Dashwood, Bennet and Darcy generations, see what adventures they have been up to and throw in a bit of mystery. I can do without the focus on 'black magic', for me, it was an unnecessary distraction."
4,Light hearted and charming,"This book will be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates the gentle feminine wit of Jane Austen. The story and its characters are set in the Regency world left behind by Jane. This is a refined, drawing room tale, with overtones of detection and Gothic mystery.The writer has tried to write in the same vein as Jane Austen, but there are a few jarring lapses. It's hard to maintain the accuracy and tone when you're a couple of hundred years after and a couple of thousand miles away.The writer manages to convey the social scene and offers acute observation of social interactions. Some of her characters are less than finely drawn, though, and this can be a distraction. But the plot holds up well and this makes an intriguing story, interestingly told."
2,"Slow and slogging, difficult to finish","I read the other reviews and then picked up this book. I love mysteries, but there wasn't much mystery here. I found it predictable, though written okay. It dragged in places, getting bogged down too much in tedious description."
1,More Nick and Nora than Darcy and Elizabeth,"This book owes more to the romantic Colin Firth A&E miniseries than the wonderful Miss Austen's original PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. The characters are all there, but I never for once felt they were continuing in the directions Miss Austen had created for them. I never believed for one moment, as I do with Stephanie Barron's Jane Austen mysteries, that the book was either written by a Nineteenth-Century English woman of wit and style, or that its setting was some time around 1813. American spellings such as ""color"" for ""colour"" abound, and the entire book has nothing of Miss Austen's turns of phrase and wit. The biggest insult was its magical mystical conclusion which the real Miss Austen would have satirized in NORTHANGER ABBEY. I was most disappointed."
1,Austen Meets Lord of the Rings,"This book was initially a fairly enjoyable read. The author must receive points for attempting to continue in the style of the original novel. The reason for my poor rating is that, at the ending, the author uses some sort of magical rings to explain the reasons for the strange occurances.This takes place with no explanation of how these items work which takes the book more into the realm of science fiction than an Austen type novel. Had this been based on hypnotism or even voodoo, the ending might have been more realistic.In summary, if you wish to write a novel in a period setting - stay true to the period and do not ask your readers to suspend belief just to fabricate an ending."
5,I LOVED this Book,I can't wait for more in this series. I thought it was excellent. I loved every word.
1,A waste of time and money,"i have read many good Jane Austen ""sequels"", and this is not one of them...I would have given it no stars if that had been an option. The explanation for the mystery was so improbable - impossible, really - that i wonder how anyone could have praised this book...When I read in one of the early pages that ""Darcy"" said ""me too"" and throughout, words and expressions that obviously never existed in the days about which Jane Austen wrote so well, and the characters continually used ""like"" instead of ""as"", I could only think the author must have had poor education in the use of the English language. If you want to read Austen-like mysteries, stick to Stephanie Barron, and give Carrie Bebris a pass."
5,A Great Hard Sci-Fi Adventure,"This is a great book by the famous eastern European sci-fi author Lem. An Earth spacecraft explores a previously unknown world and finds a very alien presence. Lots of science here, and evolutionary theory applied in an unusual manner, as humanity tries to understand the exotically alien universe (a major Lem theme throughout his works). A good adventure story as well. I read it as a teenager and occasionaly reread it- it was a mind-expander."
4,Things you must understand about this book,"Do not compare this with Walden. Dont read it just because youliked Walden.This book is told in a narative fashion, and rather personallyby Skinner. He examines (critically) a new community created by an old friend. It is an experimental way of living, and maybe shocking to people unfamiliar with Behavior Analysis. It is not a lesson or text-book, however. It is an interesting talefilled with observations and advice that are suprisingly relevant today. Sometimes frightening, but ultimately eye opening for anyone interested in society, education, or culture."
1,Screamingly boring,"This book presents one of the lamest views of utopia ever conceived. The whole emphasis seems to be on efficiency and mechanization. In that case, wouldn't utopia be called... Japan? This book is also incredibly dull, with cardboard characters admiring Mr. Skinner's cleverness at every turn. Thank goodness most people have forgotten about this idiot."
1,Dead in a week,"This looked nice out of the box but within two uses, the plastic between the brush and bristle was cracked and a clump of hair gone. A few days later, the same thing happened on the opposite side of the brush. This AM, I noticed that about 1/2 the brush was separated from the handle. Do not waste your money on this one."
4,Wonderful guide,This hiking guide is very good if you are looking to summit any of the peaks that it describes. The author provides pictures along with written descriptions of the routes to the peaks. Some of the hikes seem to be rated as more difficult than they actually are.
1,Not happy with this book,"Perhaps my expectations from this book were simply too much. This book does not provide the reader any methods or any concentration techniques.The format & quality of the book is also very poor & it simply looks like a bad collection of slidesets for a lecture, etc. I will not recommend this book."
1,Doesn't squeeze,"The frame of this juicer is flexible, so if you try to squeeze any juice from a firm piece of fruit, it just bends, rather than increasing the pressure. We like fresh-squeezed pomegranate juice, but this thing is too flimsy to squeeze more than half the juice."
1,Don't bother.,"An absolute waste of money. It worked fine for a few weeks, but no longer holds a charge. Now within just a couple of minutes of use, the phone beeps 'low battery' and dies. If I could give this item a negative star rating I would. If you enjoy throwing away money, by all means buy this battery. Otherwise spend the extra few dollars for an actual Panasonic battery."
1,Battery,I ordered 3 replacement batteries for panasonic HHr-P104.The batteries lasted about 6 weeks.They will not hold a charge. I guess that you get what you pay for.[[ASIN:B000JQJG32 Replacement Battery For PANASONIC HHR-P104 KXTGA545)
1,battery doesn't hold charge,Purchased this to replace the original battery in the phone and ended up with a battery a lot worse than the one I had. It does not hold a charge - at all.
1,Poor capacity,"Poor battery capacity. The amperage on the label is close to what the original Panasonic batteries list, however the actual charge seems to be much, much lower. Maybe a couple of hours of talk time out of this battery. Recommend looking elsewhere."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I purchased the battery to save from buying a new phone; however, I should have invested in the new phone. The battery does not stay charged past an hour off the charger!"
4,Panasonic Replaceement Battery,Bought a replacement battery for my Panasonic phone. It works great! The life of previous battery was diminishing and decided to try this product. Very pleased. Battery life is great.
2,Worked for a while,"They worked in the phone, and for a while were great replacements. However, after a few months, they now only hold a charge for 10-30 minutes."
2,Don't Last Very Long,"When I received these batteries they worked very well but soon thereafter they seemed to lose their charge in a very short time. They were then no better than the ones that I replaced. I then purchased a name brand and they seem to work fine. Oh well, you get what you pay for!!!!"
1,Waste of Money!,Good for about three weeks...now they won't hold a charge at all. I'm not able to leave the phone off the charging cradle for more than 3 hours before hvaing to charge again!
1,"NOT Panasonic, these are OFFBRAND",These batteries are not Panasonic as advertised and are very poor quality. I bought 3 and none will hold a charge over 3-4 days even with no phone use. Complete waste of money. I suggest you stick with Panasonic factory batteries and request that both Amazon and the seller include information on this item stating clearly that these are not Panasonic brand batteries.
1,Quit Working Way Too Soon,I bought this and it only worked decent for a few weeks and now it's DEAD. Having the buy another battery. I think i'll pay a bit more for another brand/seller.
1,"Great price, Poor quality","This is the second time I ordered this item from this vendor. I hoped the second time would result in a better product. The service from the vendor was wonderful but the batteries were not! I guess you get what you pay for---the batteries are of poor quality---don't hold a charge for more than 7 minutes and get steadily shorter. I've tried 4 of them hoping for better quality, but to no avail! I'll try elsewhere next time. Thanks"
1,didn't help..,"I bought this battery in hopes of getting some more life out of my phone, but all it did was make my phone real hot & I ended up having to buy a new phone anyway.."
3,"I have been using for a couple of months,",I have not encountered any problem yet and let's see how long this last with the charge and discharge cycles/
1,Poor quality,Arrived quickly and worked well for about 2- 3 weeks then the product started to loose charges.It currently doesn't hold a charge for more than 2 min. Had to go out and buy an entire new phone system.
3,Picture shown was panasonic; battery received was different,I thought I was buying a battery made by Panasonic. What I got was a battery made by another manufacturer. I hope this holds a charge for a reasonable time period.
5,Highly Recommended,This book and CD set teach sight reading in a way that appeals to children. The fact that my daughter enjoys using this book means that it's easier to get her to practice playing every day.
3,Mrs. Warren's Profession,This is more like a play. It moved too slowly for me. But if you like plays that are back in time you might like this one.
3,Fehring,Bernard Shaw rather more serious than in Pygmalion and certainly at his best. The film proceeds almost as though the action were on the stage. Shaw was a fabian and we are in the middle of the women's rights movement. You expect to see Mrs Pankhurst.
4,A little bit too long,A little bit too long. The younget dauther was getting on my nerves all the time but it is a great BBC movie.
3,A bit wooden execution,"In view of all the 5-stars evaluation I have to report that I was a bit disapponted with the lack of elegance in Quinceys explications. In the beginning I thought that this was to keep it simple, waiting for the take-off that never quite happended. The image that came to mind is that of a gold-digger who has a very good hunch on where to search but has not struck the gold yet.Was it worth reading? Yes. He does a very good job of bringing all kinds of relevant material together."
4,Key Management Questions: Smart Questions for Every Business Situation by,A must read of every middle level manager upwards to start honing your questioning skills.
5,Wonderful product,"My 16 month old loves these. She can play with the fish in the bath for as long as I will let her. Nothing else has kept her attention like these fish. We also take these to the pool, and all the kids have a blast playing with the fish and net.The suction cup works perfectly. I have stuck it to both the side of the tub and the tile. It was still stuck the next day when I went to take it down.Yes, the fish are just plastic filled with air. They are perfect for floating on the water and being caught in the net.We are very pleased with this product and highly recommend it."
2,Not impressed,"I purchased this item based on the other review, and I am not impressed at all. The suction cup is completely flat, so it won't stick to ANYTHING. The fish are nothing more than soft plastic with air blown inside, kind of like those air bags used for shipping purposes. My son likes the net, but that's about it. I would suggest to keep looking...."
3,Good battery but bad quality control on size,"I have owned three Delkin ""eFilm"" batteries. All have had a reasonable life span (I just had my three-year old, 20,000 picture battery fail). I was disappointed that of the two batteries I recently bought, one did not fit well into myCanon Digital Rebel XTi 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Lens (Black). I essentially have to force it in order to close the battery door. Otherwise, this is a decent battery at a reasonable price which can last longer than the Canon battery."
4,Delkin Devices NB2LH Rechargeable Replacement Battery for Canon NB-2LH,"Performs great. Only concern will be how long it continues to accept a re-charge, as the last one only lasted a year. But it is one-third the cost of an original equipment battery, so it can be a good value. Recommended, for now."
5,Total Telecom Immersion,"This was my telecom textbook, and I literally pored over it. What a thorough resource. It is clear the whole time you read it that the author is enthralled with the scientific concepts underlying the means of intelligent communications. It can overwhelm you from time to time, but it's not for lack of clarity -- and whenever you're ready to re-immerse yourself in more information, the book is there for you."
2,Hours of Drowsy Reading,"I am currently in my second year of college. My major is CNT (computer networking and technology). This is the class book for my telecommunications class. I have made it through 3 chapters and I am struggling to make it more then a few pages without losing my train of thought, or wanting to fall asleep. Granted, no one said telecom was a fun subject, however, this book has no helpful additional sections, no margins on the side with handy hints, etc. It has a limited number of black and white text images that my grandma could put to shame using MS Paint. So far, the class average on the chapter questions is a C. They are poorly worded and basically turn the book into a mindless scavenger hunt.This is my first time ever writing a book review. I just felt like I had an obligation to the human race, to warn people that this book is horrible."
4,New to Telecom,"Let me preface this review by explaining at 55, I have had the opportunity to endeavor on a slightly different career path. My experiences with Telecommunications to this point had been as a broadcast engineer. I needed to try and catch up to my contemporaries technically, and be an asset to the group as quickly as possible. I feel I have done just that with the assistance of this book."
3,Integration,"This book is a little beyond me. The title intrigued me, since I work in domains where there is uncertainty in measurement. But the first chapter left me in the dust."
4,Another great book,"Medalon (place name/title) was the first book that Jennifer Fallon managed to get published although it wasn't published in paperback in the United States until late 2004. Needless to say, I really like Fallon's work, and I am tired of waiting for these books to be released in paperback in the US. Harshini was just released in hardcover in July. Medalon is an engaging story that progresses well with characters, both likable and not, are well developed. One thing I really like about Fallon, she doesn't leave the reader hanging for months or even years. Her books have endings even though they are still part of a definite series."
2,Totally forgettable,I agree with one person that has already posted their reviews. EVERY move and plot advancement was telegraphed FAR in advance. Everything that happened was predictable. One thing that can be said is that the book moves at a fast pace to an ultra ordinary and forgettable ending. I normally snatch up any good book and reread several times. With this one I lament the time that I spent reading it. I kept telling myself this must get better. I think that given time Fallon will one day be a great writer. About twenty years ago some people would have been satisfied with this novel b/c their weren't any writers other than Tolkien in the genre but now with the likes of Robert Jordan and George R.R. Martin authors have to step it up a notch if they want to entertain their readers. I am amazed that the average rating was 4 stars. What are you people reading to be so easily satisfied?
3,very small watch,"The watch is fine but very small, not suitable for a big person, it`s more like a child watch.... What I dont like is the color of the band....it gives it a very old look...I tried to find another color but was impossible because it`s very narrow...."
5,As good as first season,The cartoon as a series evolved in Season Two. Though their was less of a focus on teaching valuable lessons it still consistented of good morals which is basically the Thundercat Code.The story lines get deeper and more complex and the introduction of even more villians just adds to the story.I plan on owning the whole series. A must have for any amateur or higher dvd collector.
3,"Dear Warner, please read this...","Dear Warner Bros...I have spent a lot of money on the first two thundercats dvd packs. More than 140 dollars as i can remember, because i dont live in the US.Today i was reading a good webpage, ""tvshowsondvd"" with new information regarding season2 vol1 pack, and guess what, i just read that this pack will only include english audio track.Now my question is, how in the world can you release half of the series with 3 audio tracks (english, spanish, and french) and now you are going to release the other half of the series with english audio only?i really cannot beleive this, i feel like s.c.r.e.w.e.dwhere is the spanish audio track from now on?I can't beleive what this company is doing! they want buyers or they want haters all over the world?"
3,Disappointed by this volume,"Although I'd previously only read Ozma of Oz, I was very disappointed by the style The Emerald City of Oz was written in. For some reason, Dorothy has a hick accent, Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are a little too happy go lucky, and the various towns they visit are filled with characters who are too literal and simple for my taste. I am about to read the other books in the series and hope they are written more in the style of Ozma of Oz than Emerald City of Oz."
5,"A ""Must Have"" for any fan of OZ books","This book is a wonderful reproduction of the very first run of the very first edition of this book.When ""The Emerald City of Oz"" was first published, a special metalic green ink was used on the cover, and on the illustrations throughout. However, after the first printing run, it was determined that this ink was far too expensive to continue with, and so a regular green ink was used.This special edition from ""Books Of Wonder"" very faithfully reproduces the book as it was originally printed, including the use of a metallic green ink. Other OZ books from books of wonder are similarly faithfull in being full reproductions of the first editions."
5,great book,I love this book. It was very good. Its so much different then the movie. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the Wizard of Oz.
1,DON'T BOTHER,"THIS DVD WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MY TIME. I DID IT ONCE AND THAT WILL BE THE LAST TIME. MOST OF THE VIDEO IS DI ROSENBUM TALKING ABOUT HOW TO LIVE YOUR LIFE. IT WAS BORING, AND I DID NOT EVEN WORK UP A SWEAT."
4,Appears to work quite well,"This was recommended highly by a naturopath we work with, and the results have been quite apparent. Not only have my finger nails become stronger (not something I really was really looking for), but I'd had a problem with skin on my legs being easily peeled back when rubbing up against a branch or some other object. That's no longer a significant issue - it seems to have ""thickened"" my skin, or strengthened it, or whatever caused the change. Yes, this is an anecdotal story, but at least for me, there are changes (for the better) that I cannot otherwise explain.The only reason it's not a 5-star rating is that the taste is, well, tolerable but nothing more. Thank goodness it's at least got some citrus flavor - I can't imagine what it used to be like! It's still worth the results, though."
1,Nature Works silica gel,"I don't know who decided to flavor this silica gel, but, big mistake!! It tastes terrible, and the gel is watery. I'll stick to Hubner from now on."
1,Not the Hubner Silica Gel,"I have used the Silica Gel produced by Anton Hubner and sold by various importers into North America and have always loved it for its effectiveness. This brand is a cheap look alike of the original. It has neither the look, feel, taste,consistency or efficacy of the original formula. Just buy the original, you are sure to be satisfied. This one does nothing and returned it."
5,Cordless Drill User,"I have used this drill for almost four years now and I have never once had a complaint. I haven't really tried out alot of cordless drills and since I own a Skil, most likely I won't have to. It is very user friendly and finishes every job. I only wished it came with two batteries instead of one. I would highly recommend this drill for those home improvement do it yourselfers out there because you won't be dissappointed."
1,terrible battery/ charger,"We purchased this drill a year or two ago, and use it very infrequently. We recently tried to charge the battery and discovered that both the battery and charger were no longer functional. We were told by Skill that it would cost more to replace the battery/charger than to buy a new drill. Bottom line is if you are not using this thing every day, it is a total waste of money, and you are better off buying a corded drill. This is the ultimate example of living in a disposable society. While the drill is still good, I have to throw it away because I can't charge it. The Skill rep told me that the battery has an average life of 3-4 years, so obviously they expect you to replace the drill every 3-4 years. No wonder our landfills are overflowing with toxic waste. I will never buy another skill product."
1,reviewed it,"I read only the first 2 chapters of this book. The plot is one that other authors have done - and, in my opinion - they did it better."
5,Wow! This book is unique.,"I've never read anything like Cat Tracks before. It's unique. It's an adult novel, not a children's book, although it reminded me (a little) of The Incredible Journey. I couldn't put Cat Tracks down, wouldn't stop for dinner or sleep - until I'd finished the last page. Cat Tracks tells the story of the ""bond"" between an Australian bushman and a feral cat, but most of the story is from the cat's viewpoint. I don't know how the author got into the cat's head so beautifully, but he did. There are environmental issues, and yet Mr. Aalborg is never preachy. If you like cats, you simply HAVE to read this book. It's a page-turner, very evocative, and a definite keeper. I'd even go so far as to say it could be a classic."
5,The best book about cats I have ever read!,I loved this book from start to finish. The author did a wonderful job making you feel like you were right there with the cat. I was so sorry when it ended. What a sad but beautiful story. Everyone needs to read of the plight of abandoned animals and thrie feral offspring.
5,Great CD - Harmony is Incredible!!,"These guys are brothers, and they totally know how to sing!! All of the songs are acapella with a barbershop style woven through. It is not overly barbershop though! Each song is a familiar hymn - just outstanding!! There is something to be said of brothers that sing - there blend is out of this world - Naturals!!! The baritone probably keeps them all together, he will probably be on several more cds!!"
5,Best Recipes Ever,"I owned this book over 25 years ago. It was one of the first cookbooks I ever owned. During one of my many moves, the cookbook was lost. So was I. My own copy had been used so often it looked older than it was. I have always gotten many compliments on any recipe I tried from this great cookbook. About a year ago, I was able to find a copy online and I am so happy to have it back in my life! The recipes are simple ones that anyone who can read can follow. Most of the dishes are also inexpensive to make as well. Kudos to Family Circle for taking the time to compile these recipes and make them into an easy to follow format in the greatest cookbook anyone should own."
4,Not bad,"I love the artwork in this book - very colorful, very well-done.The storyline is great too - friends stick together, even if one of them is always getting you into scrapes.I do find it a little awkward to read because, of course, there is no text for several pages in the middle of the book. At this point one has to ask the children to describe the action, but I suppose that's an important pre-reading skill anyway.Check this one out before buying it."
4,My Friend Rabbit and its predecessor,"I came across ""My Friend Rabbit"" recently and found it to be a charming, illustration-driven tale. However I also felt disappointed because of its extreme similarity in theme and execution (if not tone) to one of my children's favorite books ""One Seal"". Published three years before ""My Friend Rabbit"", ""One Seal"" tells the charming illustration-driven tale of a child whose kite slips free while flying at the beach. Page by page a variety of animals, beginning with one seal, happily come to help. They build an improbable tower by standing one another until the runaway kite can be reached. It also has the two page turn-the-book-sideways center piece tower and the cyclic ending. Any of the reviewers who fault ""My Friend Rabbit"" will also fault ""One Seal"" but I urge anyone who enjoyed ""My Friend Rabbit"" to flip through ""One Seal"" at a library or book store and see for yourself."
4,Grabs my toddlers imagination,"This book has very few words and relies on the excellent artwork to tell its story. And that is not a bad thing. My 18 month old adores this book and now he tries to tell the story by looking at the pictures. He weaves his hands about like an out of control plane and rests his palm somewhere up in the air. He pulls his shirt to show how the elephant was pulled and pushes his chest to show how the Rhino was pushed by the rabbit and he has suddenly fallen in love with crocodiles!Why only four stars? My son looks at me quizzically when we look at the final stack up - the order in which the animals were carried to the tree is different. I cannot come up with a good reason why it is so. Also, the story conclusion is somewhat hard for a child to follow. They dont have the concept of reaching up for something just beyond your grasp, flailing and falling."
3,Expected more from a Caldecott winner with such high reviews,"This book is cute, and the illustrations are fun for children, but I expected more from the great reviews on Amazon and the fact that this is a Caldecott Medal winner. I was a little disappointed. There are many cute books, but few classics. And considering the creativity and quality of illustrations in other children's books I've read, I was surprised this one won the Caldecott."
1,A caldecott blunder,"And once again we find that the caldecott has been bestowed upon a book of marginal value, and pedestrian merit.I gave this book to my daughter who is 3. We barely got through it-- the story and the art are both so convoluted."
3,The Simplicity of Friendship,"My Friend Rabbit is an animal story in which a mouse and a rabbit are best friends. Although Rabbit is well intentioned, ""whatever he does, wherever he goes, trouble follows;"" nonetheless, mouse remains his friend and helps him work through the difficulties. Rohmann's use of a limited color palette and heavily outlined cartoon style results in an air of simplicity that reflects a child's view of the world and the nature of friendship. At the secondary level, My Friend Rabbit, could serve as an introduction to the special friendship between George and Lenny that is at the heart of John Steinbeck'sOf Mice and Men."
5,Caldecott-worthy,"This book, as stated previously, is a true (and great!) picture book in every sense of the word. It ignites the children's vivid imaginations--that would otherwise be 'unimaginative' if it spelled every event out to them--by forcing them to ask questions and or tell the reader (us parents) what they think is going on.Lately books are full of words with minimal pictures, but not this one. Thank you Mr. Rohmann for creating an imaginative book with a wonderful message. Kudos!"
4,Well done but flawed,"The illustrations in this 2003 Caldecott Medal winner are for the most part, an excellent example of picture book illustration. The eye-catching artwork builds suspense, provides humor and expression, and is instrumental in telling this simple, well constructed story. However, I think that two of the full page spreads create confusion. A single rabbit appears to be four different rabbits in a full page spread attempting to show the rabbit carrying a succession of animals to help retrieve a toy plane. In the same manner, the second to last spread attempts to illustrate the rabbit and mouse flying in the plane. Four planes are shown connected by a dotted line. As a professional librarian and children's book reviewer, I found this layout confusing, as did my colleague and our story hour children. Despite these flaws, this is a good picture book, but not a medal winner in my opinion."
5,Charming Story with Delightful Illustrations!,"Wonderful fun read for elementary and primary children. Holds interest and attention! Children will respond to the story and intereact with it.Evelyn Horan - teacher/counselor/authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Book OneJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Book Two"
2,Not Music But An Audiobk,"This is not a four cd music anthology. It is an audiobook, the authorized biography of the Chieftains. There are 12 tracks of songs but the rest is narration (read by Nanci Griffith) and interviews with other folk artists (Jackson Browne, Art Garfunkel, etc.). It is for Chieftain fanatics and of little interest to Nanci Griffith fans (like me)."
4,The Long Black Veil,"I thought that this was an excellent cd! With guest vocals like Sting, Mick Jagger, Van Morrison and Tom Jones, you can't go wrong! Sounds like an unlikely mix but they pull it off so well. My favorite Cheiftains album right after Tears of Stone!"
5,From a White Woman's Perspective,"As a wife of a black man (married 14 years), I am constantly learning of the plight of african-americans and their culture in order to better understand and share it with our four children. This book has taught me more and moved me more than ANY OTHER book I have ever read on the subject. The accounts are moving, the pictures are unforgettable, and the book flows easily from one interview to the next. Every household in America with an interest in the ""slave days"" of the U.S. should read this book and keep it to pass on to their children."
3,Decent for Research,"I bought this book for research. While it was helpful the topical layout was hard to follow. I was also hoping for more information on each subject listed in the book. Many of the over 400 pages said the same thing. However, if you are looking for a primary source on slavery this is worth a read. This book covers many notable topics like the sale of slaves, duty of drivers, punishments etc."
5,Powerful,"I've been keeping journals of my life since 1972. My family could verbally tell you things about me but you really wouldn't understand how I feel or reacted to a situation until you read MY words. That's what this book is - powerful and startling. It's not a zippity do dah Disney film of sweet slavery days. It's frightening and real and an eye opener to what people do to other people. But unless you lived in those days, owned slaves or hated slavery, you won't experience the truth until you read the book - and many other like it. Good read."
5,Powerful & Moving,Wow...That's all I can say. This is a wonderful book and a must read for everyone. I read this as part of a book club discussion for Black History Month. What a way to open my eyes to a part of American history. Very moving.
5,Pilot fine point gel ink pens,I am very pleased at how quickly I recieved my order. I enjoy using these pens. They arrived early in new condition.
5,Great Pens,"My daughter loves these pens and they were the best price i could find (on Amazon).Fast delivery, no hasles."
5,THE BEST EVER!,"I have used many pens in my time, but these are by far the best I have ever used. They last a long time, the colors are beautiful, the grips are great, and the glide, oh, the glide is wonderful. I HIGHLY recommend them to everyone! :)"
5,"Ideal Fit, Performance and Color","I am a teacher and a bit of pen geek. These pens fit the hand well and never hitch on the paper. The pen tip retracts deep into the barrel so you are not going to be susceptible to bleeds in the backpack, which is why I abandoned my last favorite pen. No cap to lose and a rich variety of bright colors finishes the list of reasons why my papers will assessed with these pens for a long time to come."
5,Love these,These pens are great for the creative soul. Tired of writing and drawing in black? Check these out. Because they are gel pens they flow smoothly. The colors are vibrant so no eye strain trying to read light ink. Recommended.
5,Good pens,I use these pens to make more colorful notes for school. Well worth it if you are in grad school.
3,Fine point?,I was under the impression that this was fine point but either Pilot doesnt make these in fine point or they shipped me medium point by mistake.Either way you can't go wrong with these pens.
5,Love 'em,"This review is of the PILOT G2 FINE POINT ASSORTED COLOR GEL INK PENS, eight-pack pouch: I love having them! They work well, the colors (esp. turquoise and rust) are the intriguing type you don't find every day, and the price is right. Especially useful and fun for color-coders and people who use gel pens for expressiveness' sake."
5,Love them!,"I really love the wide range of colors you can get in the G2 pens. The reason I buy them over and over again and have for years is because I love the way the ink flows out of the tip. They are very smooth. I have a purple one and a teal one in my purse right now. The mini's are just as fun, but obviously don't last as long as the big ones. I like writing with the fun colors that are available. If you buy a pack of these- guard them well. People will try to borrow them and never give them back. I've had to start buying them for my teenage daughter who loves using them at school for note taking and such. She's hooked on G2s also! The ink almost has a metalic sheen to it."
1,Pick your Pilot wisely,"I love GEL pens in bright colors. I like these pens for how they feel and write, but have found if I do not use them continually, they 'dry up' quickly and I am unable to get them to produce ink. This is an awfully expensive fine point for it to poop out so quickly. I have 3 green pens (favorite color) and 2 purple pens in my desk drawer that I cannot use. And, I have tried several different techniques to get the ink flowing.On the other hand, although boring from the color-wheel perspective, the Pilot EasyTouch is a very durable pen and lasts forever."
4,Pilot G2 Ink Pens Are One Of The Best.,"I have searched a few stores for a good set of ink pens before I found these pens online and I was even more surprised with how good the pens work the very first time I used them. The ink keeps at an even flow which is very nice and the variety of colors are nice as well. I now have enough pens to keep at my desk, near the phone as well as in my handbag and it will be ahile before I run out of pens since these have a lot of ink in them. I'll be buying more of these next time I need ink pens."
5,Always good to have,Great buy! Loved the colors and the fine point. These will always come in handy because you can use the different colors to highlight certain points. Glad I bought them.
5,Fabulous pens,"As a former teacher and current grad student, I can say that these pens are excellent for any use. They last through many words, write as smooth as glass, and make grading and studying so much more fun!"
5,Best Gel Pen,Have bought these many times from big box stores because they write so smoothly. Needed more pens and founds these for better price than other retailers.
2,Don't buy!,"I loved this phone when I bought it 7 or 8 months ago, but now I am buying a different brand. The battery life is half an hour tops. I let it charge for a full day and it still won't last more than 30 minutes. There is a loud beep from the telezapper with incoming calls which I have had a lot of complaints about. I've had better phones!"
4,This Phone Is Great,"I think this is a great phone, I have not had any problems with it. There is no static on the line, and while it does beep when I answer it, I love the telezapper function. It is a great idea and it really does work. I have not had the phone all that long, but the first telemarketer that called got zapped. I think that is really awesome. I love the ringers, and you can adjust the volume to where you can actually hear the other person talk. I also like that it has an answering machine built in."
1,V-Tech in general,"I don't own this specific phone but was looking into it for the telezapper feature. I have a V-tech, and although I have't had any sound problems like I've read about, I still wouldn't recommend it. My problem is that my phone seems like it can't hold a charge. I could leave it off the charger for 2 hours thenit would beep to get recharged. Of it would ring twice and have a dial tone when I pick it up. I even didn't have it for a year, and it started doing this. Piece of junk!Save your money on something that works!"
1,Horrible Piece of Junk,"It looked cool in the store, but after bringing it home, it failed on so many levels. There's so much static and interference that I typically have to call people back on my cell phone. This is one of the worst products I've ever owned. I have used 900MHz phones that work better than this one. Even using it close to the base, it continues to fail. Honestly, I've had better sound from 2 tin cans and a piece of string! Do NOT buy this product."
2,NOT SATISFIED!,"We were looking for a stylish phone with call waiting, caller ID, and an answering machine at a resonable price. This phone seemed perfect but it does not have the quality that the GE we purchased last year had. They had the same price with the same features. This VTech model does not have good sound and the caller ID does not always tell who out of town callers are."
2,Nice features but bad sound,"I didn't really need a new cordless phone, but I was excited by all of the cool features so I bought it anyway. I got it all set up, but when I tried it, it sounded ""scratchy"" on my end and also to everyone I spoke to. I had to return it. Too bad. It is a really cool phone. I didn't want to try another one because it is such a hassle to buy and return, buy and return..."
2,Buyer Beware,"This is an OK phone. I love V-Tech phones and bought this one for all the features. This was the first 2.4ghz phone I bought, and will never buy one again! This phone itself is great. Easy to use and fairly priced. The range is great, but the sound however STINKS! Lots of interferance on my end. But like I said, I have only experanced it with 2.4ghz phones. I ended up buying a Uniden 5.8ghz that has wonderful clairity, but does not have the range for some reason!"
2,static static static,"I have purchased 2 vtech 900mhz phones in the past and been very happy with them. So when a lightning storm killed my current phone I was on the hunt for a new one. I looked at the features on this phone and decided it was a good buy. After hooking it up I tried it out. I know now that the 2.4ghz technology on this and some other models is no good. The high frequency transmissions were causing static at very short distances, never mind going outside. My old 900mhz would take me to the mailbox and back. After moving the base around the house and not getting good results I returned it. I am now looking into a 2.4 DSS phone or even another 900mhz if I can find one."
4,Left it in the rain?,"I think this phone is great, it certainly beats any uniden or panasonic I've ever owned. It does zap the telemarketers, the beep grows on you, or you start to block it out, the battery life is just as good as any other phone, and not to be rude, but whoever said that it doesn't always read out-of-town names, that's something to take up with your phone company, not your phone. I would recommend this phone."
3,telezapper works great...,I let the phone charge for over 24 hours before I used it and it still doesn't hold a charge very long. Also there is static on the line. The phone has to sit just right on the charger for it to charge. Other than that it has been fine.
2,A+ certification all-in-one for dummies,"Book is not separated into test objectives. All 1100 pages covers all tests. If you are not wanting to take ""Depot"" or ""Remote,"" You still must read ALL chapters to cover information required for basic tests. The book is very well written and explains topics in detail. If the book was separated into test objectives, I would give it 5 STARS"
2,UNHAPPY CAMPER,I received this book in the mail excited to begin studying for a career in IT. I thought I had a killer deal until I inspected the product carefully and found there was a very large crack in the CD that is included inside. Frustrating to say the least.
5,******** A Very Detailed Step By Step Guide**************,"Very good if you want to be certified as A+ , and also goo dif you are just trying to gain some knowledge about computers and the hardware . I loved it . Definately recomeded!"
5,Good starting book,"I just passed my A+ certifications. This book helped me a lot with the basic portions that weren't sticking from the other A+ books I had read. I didn't use the test engine, but the basic knowledge from this book helped me pass the test. I wouldn't use this book as a final review, but as a starting point it is extremely helpful (especially if you aren't in the IT field yet)."
4,It works,"I purchased this book in order to pass the A+ exam and also to have as a desk reference. This book did both. It is very informative and great to have lying around for whenever you come across a problem. I recently took and passed both the A+ Essentials and then the IT-Technician exam. Both on the first attempt. This is the only book I used to prepare for the exam. The only reason I did not give it all 5 stars is because I wish the book was organized around the different A+ exams. Instead it is all blended together. If you only want to study for a particular exam then you will have to use the index and jump around the book. Just read the book once, review some test questions and you will do fine on the A+ exams. But it is a great book to have for reference."
2,Some misleading obselete material,Just beginnng this book but I would not want to rely on it for the test. Authors still talk extensively about things like L2 cache memory being located on the motherboard. L2 has been on the CPU die for 8 years. This kind of mistake makes it hard to want to continue reading. Common writers ... give the update a little effort instead of just trying to make a fast buck ... I did not expect much for a $22 book but neither do I want to fill this old brain with nonsense.
5,Read all about it!,"The New York Times, unarguably the most influential news media in the world, has a way of shaping your way of thinking and beliefs. Such is the topic of ""The Gospel According to The New York Times,"" by William Proctor.""The Gospel"" awakens your sense of inquiry as you read newspapers and pay attention to other forms of media releases. In the book, you'll find suggestions on ways you can read or listen to the news in an active manner, as opposed to a passive one.I like the author's writing style of breaking down the subject matter in a simple way. ""The Gospel"" is easy to read and gives you a lot of food for thought.Anyone who gets news information from the radio, television, Internet, a magazine or newspaper, not only The New York Times, will be interested in picking up a copy of this book.Fafa Demasio"
5,I'm hooked,"I am not by any means a video-game player and I am the person who has to ask her IT department to help her with pretty much every computer task. That said, a store in my city had The Journey out to try so I thought I'd give it a whirl. I'm totally hooked!The graphics and music alone are beautiful and I have found the practices that I learned and continue to learn really helpful in my day to day life. It was very easy to load up (trust me, I asked lots of questions at the store just to make sure I'd be able to do it) and I can't get enough.I'm definitely considering giving this to some family members for the holidays. The benefits really have effected my lifestyle and I would love to share that with others."
5,The Journey to Wild Divine Biofeedback Software & Hardware for PC & Mac: The Passage,I have had so much fun learning Bio feedback and learnig to breath. The exercises and the story line are really helpful to achive control and develope skills for meditation. I highly recommned this product. I will be purchasing the add-on in the near future.
1,NOT MAC COMPATIBLE,"This hardware shipped does not look like the hard in the picture, and the software is NOT MAC COMPATIBLE. It's PowerPC software, so unless your mac is ~8 years old it will NOT run on an Intel powered mac."
1,Mac users DON'T BUY THIS,"I bought this hardware/software combo that claims to be both PC & Mac. BUT it does not work on Mac Mountain Lion or Lion and Wild Divine [...] has no plans to update it to make it work. So yes, that's right, the product will not work on the current Mac OS or the previous one. So, basically, IT DOESN'T WORK ON MACS. When you try to install, it looks like you have a damaged disk -- error messages about ""can't read disk"". It's not the disk, it's the product. I guess there's some cosmic joke in buying a product to teach you to manage stress that instead *causes* stress (can't usually return opened software), but right now I'm not seeing the humor. I did however get Amazon to agree to refund, yay Amazon!"
3,For beginners,"I like this product but think it's best for people starting out with meditation or calming techniques. I thought I was a begiinner to these things but I do have a little experience and the biofeedback exercises were too easy for me. I got through the whole game in about 4 hours. Other than the difficulty level it's beautifully illustrated, easy to install, everything works well and I really enjoyed the soundtrack. The setup of the exercises within the game is very imaginative and intuitive. Overall I think it's very well done, I just didn't learn anything relaxation-wise."
5,A Fantastic Tool - And It's Fun!!,"The Journey to the Wild Divine is a great game, and so much more. My husband and I both have really enjoyed it. It is a pretty sophisticated program with beautiful imagery - definitely worth the cost.The game makes learning to control your breathing, heart rate, and thoughts almost effortless. The effects of playing stay with me for several days - I feel calmer, more focused on positive images and ideals, and more ""settled"" in my current situation. It has provided me with meaningful tools and perspectives that transfer over into my life.One tip - read the Companion Guide before and during your game. It will help you navigate and add a great deal of food for thought in the process.I would highly recommend the game to anyone, and am very grateful to the creative Souls who produced it for our pleasure and growth."
1,NOT compatible with OSX Lion,"Just wanted to warn the Mac users that although the software is advertised as Mac ready it is NOT compatible with OSX Lion and they have no intention of making it compatible! All I got was an apology for my inconvenience_--a very expensive inconvenience I will note---and a suggestion that i could spend another $100 and get a newer offering of another product that they say will be forward compatible. First- I think they owe Mac users the support they give the PC users and secondly, I don't trust them to stand behind their product in the future since they do not now. IF you are a PC user you get support and updates but they have not invested an equal effort for the mac customers."
2,A frustrating game for people who need it most,"1. It is unstructured, you need to spend a lot of time exploring the game.2. Most of my time is spent wandering around walking very slowly from one place to another (without knowing where I am heading to).3. The different exercises are just slight variations of each other. Not much to learn from different games.4. There are very little instructions on how to control your state of mind/body to play the games.5. It is a very frustrating game for people with type A personality, who are impatient and have trouble calming down."
3,so so or my expectations were too high,"I have liked the adventures of Myst and Riven games... this one has much less sophisticated graphics. I honestlyhaven't gotten very far into the J WD.. because frankly, it's slow going. I will keep at it.. was too expensive to dump. I thought hard before buying... wish i'd though harder."
3,The Passage,Little more than entertainment. Did not seem to accomplish it's purpose. At times confusing to operate.
1,What a rip-off!,"I tried this software at the NYC Book Expo, & while it may be useful as a focusing program, the ""effects"" are the same whether one is happy, sad, focused, experienced, or a beginner. I tested the juggling and stairway segments, & the results were the same no matter what I thought about or tried. (I even tried reading several pages of my book while hooked up to the ""biofeedback sensors"" & still managed to keep the balls in the air!) You don't need to spend this much money on a relaxation/meditation program. Similarly topical audio cassettes can have the same effect--for a much smaller investment."
2,positive-ism as shallow as it gets.,"what i found wrong with this game is what i find wrong with the whole gutless love love, i embrace the god within you on the surface movement that is really a corporate marketing ploy to ensnare all those tripped out and fried into buying something ""hip"" before the kava kava wears off and they become born again christians. and what is up with the wig on the royal falconer? did deepak kill santa? no problems with install, was even able to play with one arm in a cast.theodore"
1,Had to return the item,"Simply put, the technology did not work. Even though I calibrated the biofeedback sensors according to the instructions (and, later, with the help of a technical support rep.), the activities in the program never responded appropriately to my behaviors or mood.For example, the balls for juggling would remain in the air, whether I laughed like a hyena, breathed slowly and deeply, or distractedly held a conversation with someone nearby. This same failed responsiveness occurred at every stage of the game.Also, the new-agey affect of the program I found rather off-putting, although I could have gotten over this, had the technology worked.A disappointment."
1,Buggy software,"If you are looking for stress relief, best thing to do is keep on walking.Installation is a nightmare. You can't tell if it is installing or not. Only thing you can do is wait !5 to 20 minutes, and if nothing happens, start cd again. Once installed, a lot of white screens, and choppy sound""Magic rings"" slip off fingers easily (maybe not made for size 13 ring finger)Also purchased ""Wisdom Quest"" Once again, sound buggy, Doesn't match up with ""Buddha guy's"" lip movement. Like watching a bad Kung Fu moviePressed ""escape"" multiple times, and wouldn't stop until it was finished.The best stress relief was putting it back in the boxDon't waste your time or money"
1,"great idea, but so disappointed","I bought the bundle and was so looking forward to using this item. Unfortunately, the sensors never really worked. I got maybe 30 seconds of spinning the pinwheel, and then nothing. I tried what was suggested (light hand lotion on tips of fingers, wetting them, etc), I'd try all different things, but alas, nothing.I just got a new, faster laptop, and thought maybe that would help...but no. No better than before. I really thought this would be a great product, and am glad some people are happy with theirs, but sadly not me.If I decide to try again (and that an expensive 'try'), I would make sure product could be returned for full refund first."
1,MORE CHUNG KUO,"OK, worked through Book 3 of the Chung Kup septology. Earth with 30 billion inhabitants is reduced to only a handful who seem to influence all events. Speaking as a technoid, it is disappointing a description of the technology needed to support such a society is passed off and very limited. However, the charachterizations seem to follow John D. Macdonald's advice to make the good guys a little bad and the bad guys a little good. So, overall better than a Star Trek episode. Coming onto 10 years on, did these books sell well?"
3,good or not so good?,"this book is pretty funny, one could read it in 40 minutes, gain a lot... but on the other hand is it worth the price? although the content is powerfull it relies on a kind of nearly disney world where everything is nice, happy and easy. each page leads to a mantra to apply, it is important to stress all of these, but as for a lot of management content it is basically just being sound and practical. so because it is well written and funny to read beside its valuable content it deserve 4.5 stars, but on the ohter end it is sometimes too easy and things fit too well that it could only get 3."
3,"An Okay Book, Check It Out At Your Library Instead Of Purchasing.","In my humble opinion, while ""Leadership Pill"" by Ken Blanchard is a decent read, the title is not as enlightening as his other titles (1 Minute Manager, 1 Minute Sales, etc.).In a nutshell, here is the summary:Leaders Must Have Four Blends To Be Effective:1. Integrity - you are what you say you are.2. Partnership - build relationships with your team members.3. Affirmation - give genuine praise to others.4. Perfecting The Blend - get others to the point where they can do projects on their own.The book is nothing but common sense. If you really care for others, then these blends should come reasonably easy for you. If you do not really care for your team members, then you have a deeper problem and maybe it is time for you to move on!A brief read. Save your money and check the title out at your local public library."
2,Read this book with Prozac,Purchased this after reading other books by Blanchard. Disappointed this time; I thought it was a total waste of time. The author tries hard to have a simile between management style and a pill that cures illness. Very little new material. Hardly any research to backup the claims. Don't waste money on this book.
1,Another Awful Book from Ken Blanchard,"Written at a level that would insult most third-graders, Ken Blanchard has managed to go from bad (Who Moved My Cheese) to worst with The Leadership Pill. Anyone that is legitimately interested in improving his/her leadership skills would find this book a total insult to their intelligence. Time to find a new management guru and let Ken Blanchard retire."
1,"A Blanchard fan, but don't buy this one","I feel badly saying something that is not positive about a Blanchard book, but I did not enjoy this book nor felt it had any value. It was creative in its style, but totally predictable in its outcome. I forced myself to finish this book and then immediately gave it away. I recommend Gung Ho or his book on Four Leadership Principles instead. Gung Ho is excellent."
5,A Contemporary Leadership Classic!,"Blanchard and Muchnick's new book, The Leadership Pill: The Missing Ingredient in Motivating People Today, is a quick and enjoyable read filled with solid truth and no-nonsense lessons for contemporary knowledge workers, leaders all. Recent studies by The Conference Board (Barrett & Beeson, 2002; Garone, 1999) document the narrowing of the gap between leadership and the knowledge worker. The Leadership Pill provides the keys to optimal performance for these individuals and teams widely populating modern organizations. Written with a broad audience in mind, this book will cross the lines of traditional business and find applicability in education, non-profit, and religious organizations as well."
3,Commonsensical ..... BUT,"Pros:The Secret Blend: Integrity, Partnership, and AffirmationExcellent read, The Leadership Pill does a great job of describing the Secret Blend in an easy to follow story format.Cons:The Leadership Pill is short and the authors spent approximately 20 percent of the book telling a story that need not be so long.The build up to the challenge was described in an excessive and grandiose manner to say the least.Oversimplified the qualities needed to be an effective leaderLittered with little catch phrases (again see page 110)Overall, The Leadership Pill is a commonsensical book with oversize font that left be me wishing I had only borrowed it."
5,I loved the main characters with its realistic plot.,I like reading about smart intelligent women and intelligent men. The plot was very realistic also. I also love happy endings and this was a story with one.
2,Are we in the dark ages?,"I found this book to be somewhat frustrating and ""caveman-ish"". I don't understand why the key characters were addressing each other so formally (Mr. Blackstone, Ms. Thornquist...) After all, they are the heads of the company! First names are acceptable in the office these days! It got to the point of annoyance for me! And the fiancee, Philip -- what an idiot! He completely ignored Letty's wishes to let her run the company the way she wished to. Joel Blackstone is a caveman, looking out for himself. These people are sappy.I did like the mystery twist in the story...I'm hesitant to read any more JAK books..."
2,Lousy packing,The tapes are ok as far as the content but how can you pack fragile VHS tapes with just thin paper around them.One ( so far) of the tapes is broken and barely useable.They should get someone with more COMMON SENSE to wrap packages. A plastic vhs video is NOT a book.AHW
5,The best game out there,"Rainbow Six is the most compelling, aweing game I have ever played in my life. The graphics are out of this world, and it is realalistic. You must choose your weapons and supplies. There is a very good balance between stealth missions and ""go-get-em"" missions. You only get 2 or three shots before you are killed. You have a special team of operatives all with different attubites. Not like those Quake shoot-em up games. This is a must buy for everyone. Tom Clancy and Red Storm are ingenious."
4,"Tale from a ""Rainbow Vet""","This game really brings me back. Despite the frustratingly heavy amount of glitches and the horribly raw AI design that makes it seem as if you're working with a bunch of retarded janitors in ski masks versus a small army of elite ""people killers"", the nostalgia, the challenges, and the strategy really make me flash back to when I use to run around my back yard with my siblings shouting, ""Tango down!"""
4,Interesting Info,"The chart looks wonderful on my daughter's wall. A couple of interesting details. The chart came with stickers to put your childs name on the bottom. Well, those stickers lasted about 2 minutes before they started curling and coming off the chart. We eventually decided to just write her name on the chart and forgot about the stickers. The other thing is that the chart has metal bindings were it folds up. These bindings were scratching our newly painted walls. Especially in a childs room where the chart will get bumped the metal bindings scratched up the walls. I was able to clean the walls, but then we decided to glue felt to the back bindings so no more scratching would occur. Other than those two very nit picky things, we all enjoy the chart and it looks great hanging on the wall."
3,Cute but HEAVY,"This is a super cute but honestly is much heavier than I expected. I returned it as I didn't want to have to use an anchor in my drywall. If you don't mind that issue, it really is very cute, large and bright."
4,Review from The Neverending Shelf,"Alison Dare: Little Miss Adventures is a collection of three exciting tales: The Arabian Knights, The Secret of the Blue Scarab, and The Mummy Child.Honestly, I went into Little Miss Adventures a little wary. While I did enjoy the first novel, it was a little all over the place for my liking. Thankfully, Little Miss Adventures puts the series on the right track. Each story was a lot of fun to read, and gave a nice amount of back story for Dare family. In comparing the two novels, I must admit that Little Miss Adventures was a vast improvement for me. I thoroughly enjoyed Alison's (mis)adventures, and the humor that is sprinkled in.Alison Dare: Little Miss Adventures shines as an excellent graphic novel series for younger readers. Each adventure is a lot of fun and will have young girls dying for an adventure of their own. If the series continues in this manner, I will definitely be seeing more of Alison Dare in the future."
5,Casting Superstar Fenton Shows Us The Way,"I came to Hollywood unprepared and naive. I had no idea how the system worked. Most videos and books written about how Hollywood works are written by failed wannabes. Not this one- Mike Fenton has worked on some of the biggest films of all time. I'd say about half of the movies I loved growing up were cast by Mike over the years. This DVD helped me see how the world of Hollywood worked, and it has saved me an enormous amount of time. I now have a much more realistic view of ""the industry"", and I'm making headway."
4,A great chapter in an excellant series,"Gundam Seed Destiny is visually compelling and has the most awesome Gundams ever! However, there is still intriguing drama, plenty of laughs and a little romance too. Although this disc begins with a recap episode and has a little filler, it gets into an interesting story line invovling Shinn and Stella at the end. And the end is a cliff hanger! Overall, this was a exciting chapter in an excellant series."
3,Long Series,OK but some time hard to keep up with the action and read sub titles.Good series but lots of them.
1,The Magic Was Lost,"As a fan of Ly de Angeles non fictional work I was delighted to learn of her new book, The Quickening. I couldn't have been more disappointed.I found the plot of this book to be almost incoherent with mini stories loosely tied together in what amounted to tedious chaos. The ill developed characters were equally overly heroic or overly villainous, all sporting chips on their shoulders the size of Texas. It is clear that Ly de Angeles was attempting to bring the Sidhe, the Tuatha de Danann into every day life for us, and that is commendable, but all she achieved was to make them look common and washed out. The magic was lost.Ly de Angeles is capable of far more. Some of her work is visionary & extraordinary but this is not one of them."
5,The revised ones,"These are great books. Best quality of christian fiction. First start out with these and if you like them, then go on to the next ones. The A life of faith show little Elsie's true personality and books numbers one through four are to her teenage years. By the way, the A life of faith are in my opinion are for teenagers. The reason is because i think teenager girls can relate to the whole series better."
1,Shameful,"Sanctimonious, vitriolic rantings of a self-centred ‘mummy’s boy’. Why have the Human Genome Project when we can simply ask Rory!"
1,Not so good,"This video is not a good Christmas video. Though the Santa looks like Santa, he doesn't come across as natural and appears too fake. He does have the white hair and beard like Santa, but that's about it. His voice is so-so, definatley nothing to get excited about. Since the video only costs a dollar or so, you may want to give it a shot. But you could probably find something better at a discount store for the same amount of money, especially if you want your holiday to be joyous!"
2,Great MP3 Player,"The sound from the music is very nice, however my $90 RCA Lyra also has great sound for music.According to the instructions, video is drag and drop. None of the video formats I have, from converted movies to AVI to simple avi movies taken with a family camera work. No wmv, no video is recognized by the device.The myTAVI desktop is confusing, I have no idea what it is trying to do, but whatever it is, nothing is going from or to my TAVI from the myTAVI desktop. I have uninstalled it because it makes no sense.If you are looking for a company that supports it's devices, forget it. The have a cryptic FAQ that does not handle the questions, a discussion thread that is no help and they have not responded to three days worth of email.I am very impressed by the potential for this device, but very disappointed in the reality.Save your money until they get it right, or go out of business."
3,Nice but too much work,"Biggest disappointment was that it did not organize the music downloaded to Tavi. It was insane to have to scroll through 500 songs to find what I wanted because most did not show the artist and I had to scroll through the title list. In addition, half the songs wouldn't play. To make any changes to the files on Tavi, I found it quicker to go through my computer. Few other disappoinments: speakers were not as loud as I had hoped, Tavi software would not update, battery did not last as long as claimed. I did like the radio, slide show feature was neat. Pictures came out beautiful on it."
1,Tavi...Hope it doesn't quit working.,"I bought the Tavi for my son last Christmas. He enjoyed using it for a few months then all of a sudden all we have is a white screen. We tried to get help on line..no luck. Called the company support service...no returned call.Unable to talk to a person must leave a phone number for call back. Decided to take it to the long beach company store. Nice building but the door was locked. A lady who worked in the buiding said they hadn't seen anyone there for a year. Now here is a company that doesnt seem to exist. I would like to send it back to get it fixed but it's like"" Wheres Waldo"". Do I send it to the Long Beach address and hope someone shows up within the year.? Very Strange. The Tavi is an expensive mistake. I should have bought an ipod."
2,thay are very simple,"You can tell this is from england by the way it is writen.This is not a bad book just very simple,for a young person just starting to build things as a hobby."
1,Making Simple Model Steam Engines,"This title should have read ""Making low quality osillating toy steam engines"". There are no ""MODEL"" engine plans in this book, only toy engine plans. A model is a small copy of a real steam engine. A toy is a small working steam engine of no specific design."
5,Clear and simple instructions for model steam engines,"Using clear instructions, without overly technical language, this well illustrated book provides excellent guidance for making small oscillating steam engines. Some can be made with basic tools - drill, vise, square and scribe. And by separating engine, boiler and burner designs you can mix and match to suit your own creative ideas. It is also good for those who just want a better understanding of how steam engines work. I recommend this book highly."
4,Excellent hobby book,"This book has it all, diagrams, instructions, and best of all its not written in technical garble."
4,Progresses from very simple to boilers and vehicles,Clear explanations and instructions presented to build up your knowledge. The only thing missing is more of a list of tools needed for each project.
4,Beautiful,"I don't normally buy graphic novels. Nothing at all against them, I'm just not into that medium. However, I am pleased to add MASQUES book 2 to my collection. This slim volume contains 3 short stories, each presented in wonderfully illustrated styles by different artists. The first story is ""Better Than One"" by Paul Dale Anderson. It's a taut little tale with only one character....well, only one body, that is. ""If You Take My Hand, Son"" by Mort Castle is a disturbing little story following Johnny's thoughts as he withers in a coma; it'll make you think about ""going into the light"" a bit differently. And finally ""Popsy"" by Stephen King has that Tales From the Crypt feel to it as well as a nice moral tale to teach us to be nicer to kids. I truly wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this, but it really brought home my childhood days when I used to curl up with a good comic book. The art is beautiful, the stories are chilling, and the writing is superb. I'm glad I ordered this!"
1,What I Thought,"I thought seesaw was a good book. But What I thought was it was a little to grafic. I mean come on, an older man having sex with a 16 year old girl. Yes it does happen in to days world but it does not mean people should wright about it."
2,"Good Information, difficult to read","While this book is full of well researched information, the author seemed to forget that it also must be read and enjoyed. While the statistics included displayed knowledge on the part of the author, they made it extremely difficult to follow without reading each page over more than once. This book is a good source for further research, but not something to read casually."
3,Not the best I've read on the subject.,It's hard to say (without writing a book of my own) exactly why I don't like this book much other than I don't like the way the author writes nor do I find the author's arguments compelling.
4,Roosevelt wasn't a dumb,"I read this good book, here in Brazil.The main lesson of this book is that behind every (american) traitor , there's a bitter childhood.Failures of this book are small.To example, this book claims that communism is just an allucination.Well, if you go to Venezuela, you will see that communism remains alive, even being a fake.Again, this book claims that american president Roosevelt was just a dumb, making everything to support Stalin.In fact, Roosevelt wasn't a dumb.He was a wise man.He knew that american public had no stomach, to support millions of deaths, in a war against nazi Germany.Then, he gave eastern Europe to Stalin, in exchange of Soviet Union wipe out nazi Germany.The price was small to americans.Roosevelt wasn't the president of poles or rumanians.He was the president of United States.In any sense Roosevelt was worse to Stalin, than Winston Churchill.Roosevel was a realistic, not a dumb giving everything to Stalin."
1,Very disappointing,"As good as Quick and Easy Thai was,that is how poor Quick and Easy Vietnamese is. I tried five recipes and would only consider making one of them again-and that is with considerable tweaking. There are far better Vietnamese cookbooks available.May 2008-have tried more recipes from this cookbook and all of them turned out quite well so have revised my opinion"
2,Very Disapointed!!,"Bought this book because of it's good reviews and high star rating. The layout and instructions of this book are easy to follow and pleasant on the eyes (vibrant colors and good quality pages). However none of that matters if the instructions are all slightly off (recipes that called for medium-high heat for 20 minutes was in actually 1 hour on high heat while covered in order for the meat to be cooked enough to eat. Resulted in good enough looking food but tasted off and not at all ""authentic"" vietnamese. I've grown up on Vietnamese food and TRUST ME you do not want to use the foods made from this cookbook to represent what Vietnamese food should taste like. My mom laughed and suggested I throw out the cookbook and finally accept her traditional method of Vietnamese cooking (a dash of this and a glob of that measurements) instead. I wonder if I can still return this book since it will definately be unused and collecting dust on my shelf!"
4,Great read: A mind blowing read on power,"I was assigned this text for a graduate course and it is very interesting. While it was hard to get my mind around the concepts of Lukes' views on power, once I did, I understood the material and understand why he is a leader in this field."
3,Uninspiring,"Doreen Virtue's books on angels are more inspiring. Also, Stuart Wilde, Dr. Wayne Dyer and Louise L. Hay's books/CDs are helpful too."
1,Interview with an Angel,"I do not recommend this product. Though I'm not part of any organized religion (or other spiritual group), I still found many parts of this book to be highly offensive. Be skeptical of this book if you are looking for it as a source of spiritual guidance or even just general interest."
4,"Worthy, But Limited","Rings true. Has a certain power to it, but left me wanting in the end. Seems like that happens almost every time to me with books of this type. Any book that leaves you hungry has value, but precious few leave you with an outlet or direction for that hunger, and this one is no different. Or perhaps I'm making excuses, or making the mistake of looking outward for direction, instead of inward. I already know I make that mistake. It's not so much that I'm looking for the perfect authority figure, just writings that inspire and lead me somewhere. I'm going to the Ramtha materials next, maybe I'm ready for that now."
5,NEVER PAY TAXES AGAIN!,"Well, now that I got your attention, let me say that this game is as close to perfect as one can get. The realistic graphics blow you out of your chair. This is the better choice over the origional. Trust me on this one. It's worth paying the extra money. Please, don't say ""well, who needs the couple extra features"" because it will not satisfy you once you buy it. It's not like Windows '95 and '98 where it's cheaper and worth it to get the origional. Buy Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear and have your source of entertainment for this millennium."
2,Don't believe the hype.,"Though visually stunning, Rogue Spear ha the worste game AI I have ever stumbled across. The ""incredible"" AI was one of the games selling points. mission success depends on how much you are able to keep your team-mates from doing anything. I love when they throw grenades in rooms with hostages. The enemies are no better. They apparrently have no way of communicating with each other so you can go through a mission removing them one at a time. Sometimes they don't even react when you kill the guy he's looking at."
3,Falls short due to lack of content,"Rainbow six is an impressive and awe inspiring game. It is fun to play and very addicting. However this module has a limited number of senarios and the time to cost benefit is minimal. If you liked rainbow six this is a must have. But there should ahve been more content. Treuly the scenery is magnificent, but who buys a game for scenery. I would like to see more missions and more varity. It pales next to the orignal"
3,Its Good,Ok I bought this game almost a year ago and I still play it but it does get tiring. The best thing about the game is when you play online at the zone it is worth it but now I am sick of it.I put a 3 ecause I am tired of playing it now but when I first got it it would have been a 5. If you want details then it has good graphics no problems and thats all.
2,Can Be Alot Better,We all heard of the action game winner of 98 rainbow six.But once we come to the year 99 Redstorm Entertainment brings out the sequal for this amazing and realistic stradegy game.I think that it is all the same of nothing although Redstorm put a lot of effort into this game but it is actually just an add-on to the first of the game series. If I had the choice between Rainbow Six and Swat3 my choice would be Swat3. The game is good and also an amazing multiplayer experience this will keep you up several nights but it is not THE HIT.
3,"After I tried the demo, I don't want to buy the full version","The main purpose of demos is to allow people to try the games. It is intended to attract hardcore gamers to buy the full-version. Of course, demos must be stable and good in quality. Unfortunately, this is not the case for Rogue Spear.I tried the demo twice and my system crashed twice. I guess that has already explained everything. How can I buy the full version if I am not impressed with the demo?Although the graphics and sound effects are excellent, the game's stability is highly questionable. I know that there are so many positive reviews for this game, but there are several negative reviews too. Before you spend $40+ for this game, I recommend you to read the review on gamespot"
5,Love the multiplayer!,"Not being a fan of the FPS genre, I hesitated before buying the original Rainbow Six. About 3 AM the next morning I realized this wasn't just a FPS with real world plot - this was an experience. Rouge Spear adds everything that was missing from the original, and the multiplayer experience is great.Highly recommended."
5,One Sweet Game,Tom Clancy's Rouge Spear is by far the funnest of all his games. Also the Urban Ops Mission pack that comes with it sometimes is great make sure that you play both. The multiplayer mode is awsome it allows you to communicate to your oponents or teammates online! A must play game. Great price!!!!!!!!!!!
2,A little over-done,"While the book kept me reading (I did finish it in one sitting) I have to say most of it was fairly anticlimactic. It seemed like there were a lot of social issues raised, then glossed over. I'm not sure if it was the author's intent to make a point of them, or not. The crime almost seemed to take a backseat, and the way it was ""solved..."" The occult actually played a part, and I prefer my detective work based in solid science (hence the reason I don't watch CSI). I didn't particularly like most of the characters - it seemed they were a little too ""odd"" on purpose. Character quirks are one thing, but taken to the extreme they simply overwhelm the characters and are detrimental to the storyline. Over all, not a book I would recommend, though not the worst I've read, either."
3,received as a Goodreads Giveaway,"A mystery set in the Victorian west- intriguing, isn't it? A local mine owner known best for her ability to start a scandal is found dead, and the chief suspect her former boy toy, with whom she'd recently quarreled. The town is on the edge of strike, and tensions run high.A great start to a mystery, and it had a lot of potential to live up to.However, it never quite made it all the way. The characters developed- but only just enough to not be entirely one-dimensional. A great deal of plot exposition was done entirely in dialogue: rather than showing us what was going on around the town, we would hear one of the few central characters talking about it. In addition, there was some backstory that felt incredibly disconnected from the rest of the story. If it had been dropped entirely, nothing else would have needed to change.I'm glad to have read it, but I really feel that the book could have used another round of editing before seeing publication."
3,O.K.,"Not as wonderful as I had hoped from the other reviews, but O.K. Quite a few pages devoted, at the begining, to the so-called 'history' of Halloween. I get tired of reading these little hearsay histories - Halloween has about as much to do with Samhain or the Celts as Christmas does with Saturnalia. Anyway, there are some cute ideas in the book for homemade costumes and some fun party games and themes that you may appreciate."
4,"Great satire, but not her best work.","A very engaging story which gives insight into what it is to be a woman desired, and what happens when desire is perverted. A refracted life seen through the clones of one woman, this is a novel worth reading and re-reading."
5,Excellent source of information and inspiration,"This is an excellent book for anyone who is concerned about the epidemic of overweight children. This book will inspire the reader to start changing their lifestyle. This book is an excellent addition to the suggested reading list for the parents of my patients.Vaishali B Kute, MDBoard certified pediatrician, Atlanta, GA"
1,Does not work with Windows Vista!,I bought these on my sister's recommendation. I was disappointed to find they do not work with Vista. The system requirements only stated CD-ROM so I had no idea that they wouldn't work with Vista.
4,Ordered as a Holiday Gift,"I ordered this four pack as a holiday gift for my sons who love the first I Spy CD they received last year for Christmas. Since they've yet to open them, I can't say specifically how they compare to the original. I can also not comment on whether or not they actually run, as again they haven't been opened! I can say however, that my order was received quickly."
1,Written by an attention-seeking woman,"Unfortunately this is a work of fiction, written by a middle-aged woman looking for attention, in the vein of Munchausen By Proxy syndrome. Chatelaine magazine in Canada has an article on it; ...Here's an excerpt: ""Tony contacted people via e-mail and phone, claiming he was dying of AIDS contracted through child abuse. Later it turned out that ""Tony"" was a middle-aged woman, but that fact was discovered only after ""Tony"" had published a best-selling autobiography, A Rock and a Hard Place (Signet), and been featured on an ABC television special hosted by Oprah Winfrey.""Don't support this fraudulent author."
1,If you pay for this nonsense you are funding the sickness behind it,"I don't care if the book is amazing... it is being sold as the biography of a young boy. Not a fiction novel. The idea that this sick and perverted woman would create such an elaborate and twisted lie to play on the emotions and mentality of a nation is just pathetic and sick. I hope this woman does check the responses on Amazon, I hope she cringes every time she reads someone's response to her joke of a book. I haven't read it, won't read it, and would never put a penny into it. There is absolutely no excuse for this book ever being printed in the first place, and under the title non-fiction biography at that. Children suffer such horrors all over the world, and to make a mockery of that sickens me."
1,"Fiction yes, fact no.","A horribly trite book where the author does ""her"" best to tug at your hearstrings. This book is a total hoax and even reading it as fiction does not help make it a better read."
1,people want to believe....,"The book is certainly sophisticated and also, not written by a child. It is a work of fiction and should be sold as such- the woman who probably wrote it inspired people and yet, managed to tell a convincing lie. Too bad she didn't market it as fiction. No photos of Tony, just comments by people he affected as he wrote to them or spoke endlessly on the telephone. Interesting how none of the information about Tony, including his birth certificate or medical care, can be confirmed. And this book is on required reading lists?"
1,Cliche ridden story that smacks of bad fiction,"I found this book to be loaded with trite, warmed over cliches fromthe early nineties. Then to read the New Yorker article that(I beleive) definatively proves the whole thing is a hoax written by the supposedmother made sense. Its hard to belive that this book is usedful toanyone. Pick up any book by Alice Miller if you want a book on childabuse...."
5,Inspirational,"How can a book so depressing be so uplifing? Tony is an inspiration to anyone who has ever felt abused - emotionally, physically or sexually. It gives the reader hope in light of all the wrong things happening in the world, there are still people like Tony who can encourage the will to live among even the most wronged victims. My only question is: Is Tony still with us? I pray he is. The world is a better place for knowing him."
1,This is disgusting....,"I read this book when it first came out. I am a survivor of child abuse, too and found the book too dificult to finish, thinking that it was a true story. Now I find it is a fake. How DARE you fake a story like this! We abuse survivors (and I am in my 40's) have fought long and hard to be believed. Then, someonewrites this. Do you know the harm you do when you write this type of thing??? If you (the author) are a middle-aged woman and have some kind of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy, I hope you get help soon. I am infuriated!"
1,"Great fiction, compelling and moving story","(I beleive) this is a hoax. No ""if"" ""ands"" or ""buts"" about it. It is a very compelling and moving story and good fiction in its own right and as such I would give it a 5 star rating. The New Yorker article November 26, 2001 by Tad Friend is comprehensive in seeking info. to verify the truth of the story and way too many holes pop up - like no record of the father who infected him being a NYC cop convicted of child abuse and murdered in prison, or doctors named in the book being licensed in any state, etc. etc. etc. It is still a good story and I wish the real author would come forward and claim credit for a well done story that changes the lives of many people who read it!"
3,Interesting but an awful untruth,"This book is a sad and harrowing account of one little boy's battle with things a child should ever have to deal with. But sadly, dear reader, this book is a work of fiction. Tony is not and never was real. His alleged ""mother"" wrote the book and lied about the existence of Tony. The real book to read here is ""The Night Listener"" by Amstead Maupin. It tells the story behind this story. Don't get me wrong, this book is worth the read. Just don't get suckered into it."
4,A follow up book to The Miracle Man (1995).,"This is a really good book. It is a follow up to The Miracel Man (1995) also written by Sharon Sala. You don't need to read that book first, and i didn't click that it was a follow up untill about half way through, but once i did i understood the story line more.A good book, but buy it with The Miracel Man if i was you."
4,Awesome book!,"This book is awesome! I love anything that Sharon Sala writes! When I feel the need for an escape, she is one of the authors that never lets me down!"
1,I did not get the chance to review this product,"I did not get the opportunity to review this product. I think it would have been good for my 3, 6, and 8 year old children."
4,fun story,"well written, as all Pratchett's books are. Not a barn burner but well worth the time to read it. recommended"
1,Not really a hardback edition,"While this is a great work of literature, the ""hardback"" edition I purchased was the crappy paperback edition with some hard cardboard covers slapped on. Labeling this edition ""hardback"" is an act of fraud. Whoever allowed this to happen should be deeply ashamed and drummed out of the publishing business. I ended up returning this and going to Alibris to buy a true hardback edition from a charity that supports local libraries."
4,Escape,Escape no flea your troubles in life and enter the world of Terry Pratchett every chance you get! Loved it.
3,Quirky but well written,Not my usual genre...a bit wacky but interesting and an easy read. Ideal for kids or adults who like to read fantasy
4,"Time for a break, Terry?","Maybe I'm getting TP jaded, but his earlier works are funnier. This was very good, but pretty much to the point. Need to keep that blend of humor and drama."
2,He does better...,"Maurice is a very clever talking cat. He travels from town to town in Discworld with a band of taking rats and a boy (who probably talks the least). Together, they run a ""Pied Piper"" scam. Now they've just arrived in Bad Blinitz, but what they don't now is this town is different from the others they've swindled. They join up with the Mayor's daughter (probably the best character) to try and solve the strange going ons the town is experiencing. Got quite confusing in a couple of bits, which is one of the reasons I gave it a lower rating. Also, I felt like Pratchett's usual originality was sort of stifled in it."
4,Pratchett amuzes to the last.,"I bought this book a couple of years ago to read to my little brother and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. There were places i literally had to stop because i couldn't catch my breath for the laughter.I've been a fan of the discworld idea for a while now, having played games and watched an animated production of Soul Music. But this was the first book i'd fully read. And i have to say that it lives up to the hype.Following the exploits of a boy, a cat, and a group of rodents who go town to town acting like pied pipers. I couldn't get over how they worked the scam. At this next town they're heading to though they get caught up in a little bit of a muddle and it really doesn't dissapoint.With insane antics the whole way through. Even at one point having the Cat, Maurice, standing face to face with Death and them both going: ""Not You Again!""Its a sweet piece of insanity that i looked forward to coming back to every time we read a new chapter.I would definately recommend it."
5,Top Shelf!,"This is one of Pratchetts best! While set on Diskworld, the novel stands alone. Being familiar with characters and events from other Diskworld novels does slightly enhance the reader's experience, but isn't at all necessary to understanding and enjoying the story. Buy it, read it, enjoy it! FIVE STARS!"
3,Vaguely Discworld,"This is set in Discworld, but the tone and satire of the other Discworld novels is missing. The book appears to be written for an 8th grade reader, (high Harry Potter to low George Orwell). The story was a little more serious than The Rats of NIMH, but an easier read than Tailchaser's Song. I don't recommend it to adults, nor is it a ""junior"" introduction to Discworld for the junior high reader. It is a quiet, solid, story. If you are looking for the humor of Discworld, you'll be disappointed"
5,NOTHING COULD TOP IT!!!!,"I really liked the book. I liked all of the names of the rats, especially Dangerous Beans and Hamnpork. It was really funny especially because they dragged around the book ""Mr. Bunnsy has an Adventure""."
4,Good book!,It's a clashing of good and evil in the guise of human nature. It describes acts of extreme bravery and acts of greed. The problems in one group of beings at war with another group of beings are shown from a different angle. It's an easy read with a bit of tension in it.
4,"OK its for young folk, but I liked it too (60 yr old)","The pied piper was never so funny. This happy story must be a take off of the potential of three mile island or Chernoble. Talking animals (OK the dog was ok, but Cats and Rats? YES!!!!!!!!!!! And their out look on live is well done yet again.Somehow I think Terry could also be a philosopher or maybe he is."
5,STOP OVERWORK! TAKE A LONGER VACATION!,"This is a must-read for all Americans! Because most Americans work too much and have very little vacation, they are stressed out, eat too much junk food, don't get enough sleep, have very little leisure time, rarely see their friends, and have little time for their spouse, children and pets! Joe Robinson is trying to get ALL Americans a minimum of 3 weeks paid vacation per year (Europeans and Australians get 4-6 weeks by law, while Americans get ZERO). In this book, Joe shows you how to work less and get more vacation time! He also talks about how we are constantly busy and don't know how to slow down. There's a lot to learn in this book!"
4,"Locust Alley good read for buffs, amateurs alike","Don Evans' ""Locust Alley"" is a good read for Civil War buffs as well as casual students of the epic war and its time period. Impeccably researched, the novel's plot not only provides a decent mystery to vex the brain, but also gives an unadorned snapshot of Richmond, Va., during the war. A great book for a beach weekend or a rainy day, ""Locust Alley"" is nevertheless not for the faint-hearted or puritanical. Evans tells of Civil War-era soldiers and sleazeballs, prostitutes and profiteers, without holding back. Overall, a very thoroughly researched mystery written well."
