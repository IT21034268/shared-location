1,landmann barrel grill,"The grill as a whole has good size for camping.Overall workmanship was pretty shotty.The lid does not close good.Pretty flembsey overall.There is no door to get ashes out,You'll have to take grills out and scoop them out.I should have shopped around more."
2,ok grill,"Not too bad for the price. Missing a couple of nuts, so have to dig into my stash. Shelf isn't sturdy, so becareful. The grate for the charcoal can't stand the heat; it starts to warm after a few uses. Recommend a cover or leave indoor after done, because will rust."
1,Stay away from that grill,"This item does not live up to the description, the material is filmsy, the grill was not properly packagedfor shipping so it was damaged in transit.Would not recommend.Purchased one from Amazon but returned it.Got a better quality one made by Kingsford at walmart at a cheaper price."
4,"Great hat!, Trendy.","The hat is awesome, though I need some tips about making my head look smaller in it. The color makes my head look like a watermelon-head =PEverything is fine."
5,Eclectic electronica,"I devoured this energetic, infectious music with tastes of Latin AM radio. I found S.O.L.O. on the Dance/electronic listening wall at a Virgin Megastore. I listened to it about 50 times on a home compilation with Moby's ""Play"" and SSAB's ""Presents"" (Appalachian psychedelia).If the electronica scene is starting to bore you, GET THIS. Delicious."
1,"Looks cool, but unfortunately it's junk","We got this watch for our child, who thought it looked so cool. And it does look cool. Unfortunately, it is junk. It quit working within 1 year, so we took it to the jeweler to have the battery replaced. Wasn't the battery, the watch had died & it wasn't worth the cost to fix it. I would not recommend this watch!"
3,Memories,"The Reminiscences, first published in 1991, reprinted in 2000, offer an anecdotal history of events prior, during and after the Civil War as recalled by GEN Basil Duke, a Kentuckian who rode with John Hunt Morgan's cavalry. The narrative jumps and skips over matters weighty and minor, from one well-drawn vignette of soldier life or Southern culture to another. While the volume does not lend itself well to the general reader, it remains of interest and value to Kentuckians, scholars of the Civil War and, in particular, those studying the Confederate High Command. Lengthy sections are devoted to discussions of Braxton Bragg and John C. Breckinridge (commander of Kentucky's ""Orphan Brigade""). Highly recommended to the specialst and the devoted Civil War buff."
4,Wash it first,"The towel was stiff and difficult to work with. After washing and drying it, it softened up. You're not going to get much flexibility out of this towel until you wash it."
3,"Nice update, but still stick to the old","Before I bought this particular cd, I heard it was much heavier sounding than the original. That it is indeed with more production in guitar work which shag and silenoz does all themselves along with bass and keyboards. And Hellhammer behind drums. It's not bad to the original Dimmu fan. Though I still prefer the old stormblast much better, because the mood and atmosphere was perfect. Didn't get to see the cd yet. Kinda accidentally dropped out of my hands and broke in half :( LOL. Anyways, time to get it again or something. so no comment on dvd for me. I reccommend For All Tid, Stormblast(1996), and Spiritual Black Dimensions to a first time listener. Then you can get a feel for what Dimmu is all about."
4,Good But the Original Was Better,"This is a good album however it doesn't have the dark gloomy feel to it that most 90's black metal albums have. Plus it doesn't have the intro to Alt Lys Er Svunnet Hen and Sorgens Kammer, but they were forced to because their keyboardist at the time plagiarized the work. The intro was plagiarized off the Magnum song ""Sacred Hour"" and Sorgens Kammer came from the video game ""Agony"" (don't belive me look it up). Even though with these downs I was amazed on how soild they made the songs, and besides these guys are one hell of a band."
3,Not Bad as an Introduction to Paul Ricoeur's Philosophy.,"This essay examines the question of free will as against causal determinism by contrasting Paul Ricoeur's phenomenological and hermeneutic approach to the issue with the thorough analysis of the topic offered in a recent book by the pragmatist Owen Flanagan. The author provides his own own assessment of these thinkers, which I agree with, since I happen to be the person who wrote the book. The footnotes are interesting and Ricoeur's theory is summarized pretty effectively."
5,Handy and complete,"We moved here and still find this book helpful. Its phrase section is complete and covers most situations that one encounters. The best part is a well-organized section on declensions, conjugations and grammar that is more easily-referenced than the Norris book that we also use.It also has some handy ad ons: maps, road signs and a remarkably complete dictionary.As for the pronunciation guide, what can you say? The Norris tape is helpful, but your tongue will only get wrapped around all those ""njs"" and ""ljs"" after some practice."
3,Rudimentary -- travelers only!,"I purchased this book, and now see it would have been a better idea to purchase the book/cassette combination. The Croation alphabet contains letters not found in English, which makes it difficult to attempt to sound out the words without constantly referring to the pronunciation chart. Other than that, this is a typical travel phrase book, but anyone planning an extended stay or an immersion in this language will need more than this book contains. In addition, unlike some travel language books, this one is short on tips about the local culture. I would suggest that rather than purchasing this item, buy the Audio-cassette version, which contains the same book."
4,Sturdy,I ordered this for my son who wanted some religious pendants that included dragons. He likes it and wears it often. It appears to be very sturdy. Great for pagan kids.
3,Larger than expected,"Normally when you get a piece of jewelry and it's bigger than you expect - it's even better. In my case I wish it was smaller. However with that being said, the product was perfect in every other way. Great packaging quick delivery!!!"
5,"great book for learners, and those who are more skilled.. good songs","Teaching myself acoustic guitar.. this book is full of good songs, not that hard, so its fun to use .. and play along with.. I recommend the book to any aspiring guitar players."
4,help for the novice,Not exactly what I had expected but does provide some instruction for my son who is all thumbs.
2,incorrect key,"Very disappointed. it's not the original key. After seeing 3 pieces, I found that none of them is on the original key."
4,Complete Guitar Player Songbook/Omnibus edition,Not a bad collection of songs. I use it for teaching to give students a introduction to a wide variety of musics.
5,An excellent assortment of songs for all guitarists.,"It is hard to find a book that has a good assortment of songs to play through. Most songbooks tend to be compilations of one style or genre of music. Unless you feel like playing through a book of Pop Hits of the 90's or Broadway Love songs, this book will keep you happy for years to come. The Complete Guitar Player Songbook includes songs of the Beatles, James Taylor, Cat Stevens, Simon & Garfunkel as well as folk standards and a number of classical selections. The book includes chord diagrams, suggested strum and picking patterns and is in standard notation as well as tablature."
2,A Very Mixed Bag,"The good thing about this book--and about this songbook series in general-- is that it includes many popular songs that are good for a guitar player to learn, both to learn basic chord technique and build repertoire. The bad thing is that they are rife with errors, including unconventional and sometimes frankly incorrect music notation, some incorrect chord changes, and even some wrongly transcribed melodies (and it includes far too many of Shipton's own compostions, which are of minimal value). If you can find another songbook or songbooks that include most of the songs you want to learn, it is probably a more faithful and useful reproduction than this book. However, it does give good practice in basic chord changes, and has a good amount of good (and bad) songs, mostly folk and pop from the 60s and 70s, with some traditional tunes."
3,"good book, but geared towards 60's and 70's music","Overall, this is a good not great book. The bigest problem I have is that I'm not familier with most of the songs. It's difficult to tell if songs sound as they should. A cd to go along with the book would be nice. People should not expect anything later than the Eagles or other late 70s bands when buying."
2,Not that good,It doesn't last very long...maybe 1 day at the most...I got better results from using superglue. It felt gooey and attracted too much dirt and lint.
4,Works well,"I get a cracked thumb every year during hunting season from exposure to the elements. Although Nexcare Skin Crack Care is not a miracle cure, it does a good job. It does require multiple applications. It seems to relieve the tenderness and is the best product I have found so far. I recommend it."
1,Don't understand all the positive reviews,"Bought it from some other site, for a little bit less than on amazon. Purchased together with ""Skin Shield"". This one smells like hell, costs three times more, for much less quantity and is no good. It doesn't hold to your skin, gets washed away with water, the moment you get close to it. So it's pretty much useless."
2,Not Impressed,"After reading the reviews I was very excited to give this product a try for the cold winter. It does not have a strong smell at all which is good. However, I was disappointed at the lack of effectiveness. It almost seems too thin and watery to give my small cuts a sufficient barrier. I keep re-applying in the hopes that it will work better but it's ""so-so"" at best."
5,Minha Opnio,"O produto é muito bom, o problema so os impostos que Governo brasileiro me cobrou. Comprei dois por $14,00 + $20,00 de frete. Chega aqui me cobraram mais R$ 51,00."
2,doesn't work....,"I wash my hands a lot and in the wintertime, my skin is prone to cracking, especially in creases. While the skin crack care does seal the crack, it's so thin, I don't think it stays for very long. And I haven't noticed that my cracks are healing any faster using this compared to what I usually do (vaseline). The Advanced Skin Care Cream that is advertised to use with the skin crack care is very good; using that alone is better than the skin crack care."
3,Worked OK,My husband gets awful cracks from working outdoors and we were excited when we saw this product. It helped but wasn't a miracle cure. I think that a good hand creme applied many times a day works just as well. He also applies creme and wraps his fingers overnight. That seems to help the most.
5,This really works!,"This is the best product ever! I've tried absolutely everything to heal my fingertips with no success but this worked in 3 days. Plus, it's not sticky, dries fast and has a pleasant smell."
5,"Funny, Touching, and Real!",This beautifully illustrated book will bring a tear to a (grand)mother's eye although with smiles and warmth. The author speaks through the eyes of a baby admiring a brother 5/6 years older. Perfect for young readers. This book should be nominated for an award... simply wonderful!!
5,WHAT A FIND,"A sublime new classic that speaks to a childhood anxiety with the same wise artistry as Goodnight Moon or Where the Wild Things Are. Fisher's through-the-eyes-of-a-child photos and text elegantly walk the line between truth-telling and whimsy, wonder and honesty. Best of all she strangles those other idiot-books--the ones that insist the big kids will all loathe their little bro or sis and want to send him or her back. Hello. When the little he or she worships the very ground you walk on... Are you kidding? Would you or I willingly surrender super-hero status?! Fuggetaboudit. No WAY! A must to give to families that are jittery over a sibling on the way. Hey, I'm stocking up."
3,Wonderful musical acts; dull story,"It's hard to assign a star value to a movie like this. Lovers of 1940s musical productions will love the variety acts with Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Spike Jones, the acrobats, and even the harmonica band. (Spike's zany production number is written into the story line with wonderful results: the band's soloist has no idea the nature of Spike's band, and is bewildered why the audience is laughing during her singing. The story itself that ties the musical numbers together, however, is silly and deadly dull: ""I Love Lucy"" type pranks without any of Lucy's endearing charm. Fortunately, there are LOTS of production numbers!"
4,Fly Whisk,The Item looks to be good quality; I like how the handle is made along with the whisk part of this item.
3,Whisk OK,"I've only used this product a couple of times and while it hasn't fallen apart, it hasn't really been truly tested for durability.I think while it's OK - what I am really looking for is something that is both a crop/carrot stick and a fly whisk. This is more of a fly whisk.It's great to have on trails for whisking flys away, but I find the wooden stick part to be a little bulky - I would rather have something with a little more ""snap"" to it - more like a crop. I use the Parelli training method with the carrot stick and find that for long trail rides the carrot stick is too bulky and doesn't have a wrist strap. It's not as good for cueing my horse as a Parelli stick... I am going to try to modify a broken carrot stick by adding a fly whisk to it in order to get the best of both worlds.The handle is vinyl - not leather - kinda cheesy considering how much this cost."
2,Try a different pinball,A great concept but very disappointing. The toy seemed to spark interest in the box however once it was put on had many flaws. The first being the background music that plays the minute you hit the on switch. Very loud and annoying. There is a button where you can hit the music to be off but that does not keep a childs attention. They should have put music on that was not as loud and annoying. Also the 2 figures do not stay on. If you touch them the slightest bit they fall off. The toy would have been better off without them. The biggest flaw is the trap button in where you score the most points. You have to hold the button down in order for the ball to fall into it. How can you expect a 5 yr old to hold that button down while also manuvering the flippers. It is impossible. I would recommned nixing this toy off your list.
5,Excellent Educational and Clinical Tool,"This product was a wonderful tool to use with children who love the game Jenga. I also purchased the additional Talicor cards that had to do with divorce, peer pressure and then created some of my own from my own experience when working with families. The parents and kids love playing this game as it is a great tool to get to know one another."
3,An average game not worth the extra price compared to Jenga,"First of all I liked the idea of using this style of game for counseling and getting people to open up. With that said the game was poorly made if you ask me. The blocks weren't all cut evenly so the tower didn't stack like it should to be fair. I bought two boxes of this game and both had that problem. Also the teens I used this game with got bored of the questions asked very quickly. I had to mix other question cards into the deck to make it fun. After a while I quit using these blocks and just bought the original Jenga game and wrote my own questions on the blocks. The kids enjoyed playing it better that way and I could make up questions that related to specific treatment plans. I just got a black fine point sharpie and wrote two questions on each block - one entertaining and the other serious. Again, good idea in regards to this game but get rid of the boring cards and make the blocks better."
5,Great,I am a therapist who works with adolescents on a regular basis. I Love this game! The kids love it and it keeps them engaged. I recommend it.
2,Not easy to remove pieces because they stick,"I bought this item thinking it would be great to use with kids in therapy. Unfortunately, possibly due to the paint, the pieces of wood stick to each other, making it very difficult to remove even one piece before it all comes crashing down. One kid made the suggestion of using sandpaper on the wooden blocks so they won't stick. I haven't tried that yet, but product has been a therapeutic bust."
4,Talicor Totika,"Fast shipping (amazon prime). My son love to play Jenga so I thought he would love this toy, plus a little learning to boat."
2,Misleading Ad,Misleading Ad would have you believe your saving 137.00 and your getting more than one can you get one can for a high price of 22.00 live and learn would never buy again save some money and go to walmart they sell it for 5.99 a can
5,easy to read and helpful,great book for health care providers just starting out or for students like myself. It's well- organized and concise. Worth the price.
2,Another reissue,"I don't own this album. I own a similar one called ""woke up this morning and found myself dead"" which has the same songs. This one is more than likely the same recording and I bet has the same poor sound quality (never meant to be commercialized). Jim Morrison is in it, drunk and screaming obscenities. According to the notes on ""woke up"", Buddy Miles and Johnny Winter are also present (there is another guitarist that sounds like Johnny allright, is it him remains to be proven). The whole thing was recorded in a bar in New York - The Scene Club ? - somewhere in 68 so yes, it is the real thing ... jammy bluesy screatchy electric guitar and all but for some reason, is very depressing and painful the play and hear. If you are craving more from your fav guitarist and are ready for a bad trip, buy it. If you respect the Master, you may as well skip it. I own it (or similar) and NEVER play it."
5,nice unusual earring for the price,These earrings are nice and give a look of movement which makes them unique. These earrings are small though - about the size of a nickel.
3,good but not the one i expected,"good but not the one i expected.i expected the silicon skin would be smooth surface but it was not,but anyways, it's quite good, for the whole package of protecting accessories"
2,Not really what I was expecting,"I was somewhat disappointed with the quality of these cards - the cardstock was noticeably thinner than the Mermaids and Dolphins cards I bought several years ago, and does not appear to have a laminate coating as the older cards do. The gold edging stuck the cards together so tightly that I was worried about damaging them as I pried them apart, and some have been left with visible sticky-looking marks around the edges. The gold edging also flaked off - my hands and the table were covered in it after my first use of the cards. Between the thinness of the cards and the flaky gold stuff, I'm concerned about how these will hold up with ongoing use.I would also have liked some mention in the promotional spiel that they appear to be written for a very young audience, with several passages in the accompanying booklet basically boiling down to ""ask a grown-up""."
5,A Lovely and Comforting Deck,"The cards are beautiful and the descriptions in the companion book insightful. I find this to be a very comforting deck when I read from it, especially when the message is for the querent is a bit heavy. Definitely recommend for all ages."
2,The Cards are nicely drawn.,"I have Doreen Virtue's other deck of Magical Mermaids and Dolphins. I bought this one, thinking it was the same. I was disappointed at the sameness of the cards, and the messages. The cards are nicely drawn and do invite imagining. However, it is a little heavy on white horses, and does not have enough variety."
1,Picture deceiving,"Buyer beware! I was looking for a replacement of my Doskocil litter scooper and this seemed to look the same on the website... what a disappointment when I got it!My old Doskocil is the only litter scooper on the market that I know of that actually filters scoopable litter effectively because it has a 3/16 inch ridge at the lowest point of the pan, right where the smallest solid pieces of the sifted litter collect. Ideally this ridge would be even twice as wide. The scooper I received does have a narrow solid part but on a slope, not the lowest part of the pan... so, it is of no use whatsoever to sift out the small solid parts (the most difficult to get out). Does anybody know of any scooper that is like my old Doskocil, i.e. that has an angle and a ridge across the pan? gabimaus@pacbell.net"
5,Best 'Reference' text on Mathematical Methods,"As a physicist I'm constantly scrambling to my bookcases to look something up. This text sits at the top of my shelves and is used more often than any other. I give it 5 stars as a reference text, however I cannot really rate it as a 'learning' mathematical methods text (maybe 3 stars?) since most of the methods are familiar to me."
3,Very much like reference book!,"This book basically focuses on formulas, a little proof is done. The authors (there r 3 of them) make the text very concisely well written. However I don't recommend this book to anyone that wishes to really ""learn"" something from it. Most of the book is concentrated on equations."
1,I am devastated,"This book is impossible. It does not teach math at all; after it barely touches on the foundations, it went on to solve extremely advanced problems, so that it encourages the reader to imitate rather than to learn. The foundations are taught in a manner so hard to swallow and so brief, it's like as if it's just a review. Indeed, this is a reference book."
3,It is alright,"Because of the price I paid I can not be too upset, but I feel I could have printed a copy of the poster myself on poster paper and it would have looked just as good."
1,No More OCR Scanned & Print Generated Books For Me.,"I received maybe 75% of the books intended value. The OCR scan and print technology, ""without an editor/proof reader"", does not capture everything correctly and they are missing all the images. Not only misspelled words with the wrong characters substituted, but the formatting was thrown off as I was lost to what the author was trying to say. Lots of reader effort to get through this reading. The author has some good points to be made -- think I seachout another copy elswhere."
1,"Man, Magic, you could of done way better than this","Magic is one of my favorite rappers in NO Limit. His first CD was the bomb. Song 3 with Mystikal is by far the best song I ever heard. However, it seems like he rushed this CD and made it in a day. There are no tight beats, no lyrics, nothing. It's not good and I would not reccomend to buy it. I have a feeling that the end of NO Limit is coming to an end, at least if their top guys are putting out CD's like this. No good songs. Hopefully Mac, WWIII will be tight, because he is great lyrically."
4,Good Second Effort,"Magic's second cd is an incredible one. The first song ""That's Me"" show dramatic improvement from his debut. By far the highlight of the album is ""Club Thang"" which features C-Murder and QB. This album would be great for any collection. Pick it up."
4,THIS CD IS THE BOMB!!,"MAN, I GOT THE LAST CD AND IT WAS TIGHT SO WHEN I BOUGHT THIS CD I FIGURED IT WOULD BE GOOD TOO. BUT I NEVER THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE THIS GOOD. MAGIC SHOWED THAT HE REALLY DESERVES TO BE ON THE TANK. I DON'T KNOW WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT WHEN THEY SAY THAT CASH MONEY IS ON THE RISE 'CAUSE NO LIMIT IS STILL THE ***"
5,This album is soo tight,Magic's first album was a let down but on Thuggin Magic came correct. I got this album soon as it came out. Don't sleep on this album.
2,Ball Is Too Hard,"I bought this ball hoping it would be soft enough for (1) indoor house soccer play and (2) heading practice for kids who are shy/tentative about heading a real soccer ball. However, this ball is somewhat similar to a regular soccer ball, and is only slightly lighter and softer. Therefore, the ball did not meet my intended purposes."
5,"Dream no little Dreams: A biography of the Douglas Government of Saskatchewan, 1944-1961","Excellent book! Valious tool for anyone interested in study how the Douglas government was succesful. Gives a view about the role Clarence Fines played and how the first socialist government was fiscal responsible with no deficit and surplus. Good book for public policies studies because is based in the A.W. Johnson' Harvard thesis.Dream No Little Dreams: A Biography of the Douglas Government of Saskatchewan, 1944-1961 (IPAC Series in Public Management and Governance)"
4,"Don't know if it accomplishes ""Made Slightly less difficult""","I have read Pollard's book. It's got some good stuff in it, particularly about how to speak to various worldviews.However, one has to be an academic thinker to know how to examine worldviews and how to articulate your thoughts, and how to compare/contrast worldview answers to various ultimate questions.I don't find that simple, or less difficult as that's not quite how I'm wired.The book deals on a more philosophical/apologetic approach, rather than other various approaches to the gospel. It is a reflection of the author's gifting and calling and could still be a great addition to your evangelism library.ChrisEvangelismCoach"
1,Cheap Plastic,I was expecting a true Casino grade marker for $7.99. This is a light weight plastic marker. I would have expected to find this in the dollar store. Very dissapointed. Better to find a glass paper weight for the same or less.
5,I LOVE LUCY,Glad to be able to still get VHS tapes. Work with the DD population who are unable to use DVD players and enjoy the Lucy Show.
5,Pillsbury Doughboy Covers,Sence I collect Doughboy thing I really like thes stovetop covers. They go with the other things in my kitchen. I did make a mistake of turning on the wrong burner and burnt one of them up lol. But I still have three left. I highly recomend these to any Pillsbury Doughboy collecter or fan.
1,Why?,"5 STARS!??? That is crazy! All you do is go around and kill some motorcycle driver. Wait, let me fix that, the guy never is hurt. You can fly off some 500ft. mountain and not break a bone. Second, the game blows you off if you go to far.The people are dots, EVEN CLOSE UP. That is even horrible for win. 95, which is an ancient OS. Get Midtown Madness 2 instead. It's halfway decent for even win. Xp, a current OS. So sad, this game.........."
3,Saturday Night,"Susan Orlean's, Saturday Night is a glance into the lives of any average American on Saturday nights. Within a few years of research, Orlean explores a variety of nightly activities, including visits to fraternity parties, polka dancers, dieting clubs, etc. Orlean has excellent writing techniques that seem to draw in readers, regardless of age. Orlean also tends to research thoroughly, writing about every age group, from the high school crowd, all the way up to people in their senior years. The book fulfills its goal in touching almost every group of Americans and leaves the reader satisfied."
2,soothing with your eyes closed!,It was good when I first got it.. after a month or so stains start to form on the water reservoir especially close to the edge and it's impossible to remove. It then turns to an unlikely sight. Right now it stopped working.
1,Bad product,"I put it together following the instructions, and even added water, and it just buzzes loudly. Not very peaceful at all. I want my $20 back."
1,WHAT???,NEVER RECEIVED PRODUCT!!! SENDING TO MILITARY PERSONNEL MUST NOT BE ON THEIR HIGH PRIORITIES!! I WILL NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!!!
2,was going to buy it but....,"I thought this fountain looked good, but 4 out of 5 reviews dissed it, so I decided to go with the majority and not buy it. If anyone else bought this and thought it was cool make sure you do a review cause those things make or break a buy for these products."
3,It's only half good.,"front end looks good as pictured. back end shows silver plastic stems. not enough rocks to cover the base. whole thing looks as if it was setup to take the picture. 2 more slates for the back and 2 more bags of rock would've made this product much more pleasing.(and I would definitely paid extra to complete this fountain)manual says water constantly evaporate so it needs to be refilled. I find base dish not big enough to hold water from sprinkled out of the plate rather than evaporating.kudoes for including extra light burbs.note: I took off pump cover that has suction cups. have the pump suspended in the water, dangling only by the tube. Now I don't hear pump vibration that was passing on to the table.Gotta go look for polished river rocks in the mall now."
3,pretty good item for under $20,"I bought this even though the other reviews were poor, and I'm pleasantly surprised. You get two bags of rocks, plenty to cover the base and some of the black slate plates.It does have a bit of a buzz to it, but if you overfill it a bit and take the time to position the plates and stones, and let the circulator float in the well, the buzz becomes white noise. Again, the issue of water splashing out can be resolved with a bit of time spent positioning the slate plates. It took about 20 minutes of my time, and I have no water splash whatsoever.I use this in my bedroom in place of a humidifier and it works quite well, especially when it's refilled daily. The tiny light works great as a nightlite, too.Homedics listened to everyone's issues as well, because the instructions now address these two problems and offer some solutions.Other units I looked at started at $50 and went up, so for me it's a great little find. Just don't expect a $150 fountain fortwenty bucks...."
3,Awful!,"This was so pretty in the picture but when I got it home it didn't go together like it should have, within 5 minutes the whole desk area was covered in water, I never could get it to line up so the water trickled, instead it just gurshed in one area and all of the water splashed out. Not enough rocks to cover bottom of platter, does make relaxing sound when turned on but too much trouble otherwise. Used it three times then put away. Should have taken it back."
4,I am not sure what the other reviews are talking about...,"I love to have a fountain on my desk at work. It is very peacedul and helps me concentrate. I have been looking for a ""natural"" fountain and I saw this one. One of the reviews below said something about it being small, so I thought that would be great - it would fit on my desk. A saucer roughly the size of a dinner plate sits on the base - bigger than I though. I found there to be plently of rocks... the slate is fully adjustable so I just turned the pump down, moved the slate around and it works fine. No splashing! And it is quiet! I would have given it 5 stars - but it was too big to go exactly where I wanted it on my desk, so I had to move some things around."
2,Awful,"This item was given to me as a gift and within a few months the motor started making a lot of noise, then in addition to that it would gurgle up the water, needless to say it got really 'unpeaceful' pretty fast. Now I just have it sitting unplugged collecting dust with no water in it. When it worked it was beautiful, but I don't think it has much of a life span."
3,Nice decorative piece but don't over-use,"As a decorative piece it looks great on an end table next to a lamp. The water flows nicely, but I can already tell that if I left it on continually it would start getting noisy to where I would only use it as a decorative piece. If you want a true water feature, you need to go up in quality and get something sturdier and likely more expensive, but for $30.00 or less, this is pretty good."
5,Exactly what I thought it would be,This rock fountain is a replica of one I already had. So I knew what I was ordering and it is exactly what I thought it would be. It looks real however. Lightweight and wonderful.
2,Not exacly what I expected,"I was hoping for a better fountain, that is water flowing continuously all the way around it. I was disappointed. For the amount I paid for, it's as good as its going to get."
3,Not like the original,"A few years ago I had a Homedics Envirscape rock garden fountain. not illuminated, but solidly built.It finally got a little ratty with use, so I decided to buy a new one with a light this time. This new version is very cheaply made out of light weight plastic.. all of it. I was rather disappointed to say the least, but I decided to put it together and see how it worked. It takes a little patience to put it together. It's working ok. Having the setting on the highest level for the pump is the best. Anything lower is useless. There are less rocks than in the original, so the inside workings do show. I plan to put more of the old rocks in and around it to cover up the open spaces. It seems nothing is built very sturdy anymore. Hearing the water fall over the rocks and slats is peaceful. I needed that water flowing sound.We are in a severe drought."
2,Flimsy and not impressed,"I purchased this fountain and it lasted for about 1 year. I used it on a daily basis, but putting it together was not fun. It did look nice once it was together, but very wobbly on the top and flimsy. But one drawback is that you can only display it with it set against a wall. The fountain finally broke, but the pump still functioned so I ended up being creative and making my own fountain out of the slate pieces and river rock. Eventually the pump gave way and that was the end of the fountain. The fountain itself was soothing, but it did splash and you have to keep up daily to refill the fountain. Overall I give this fountain two stars. This fountain is not for daily use and not made well."
2,Broke,"My 9 year old daughter loved the design, but the arms broke off within a week.Great looking but not durable enough for kids."
1,Disappointed,"I debated whether or not to leave a review and finally concluded that I would have wanted this info when considering to purchase the product. Long story short, I initially purchased this product and it did not fit, even though stated otherwise on the amazon website; they refunded my money minus shipping. I reordered the product per the directions of their employee; again did not fit and refunded minus shipping. All in all, I spent months ordering and returning the product and fighting to get my money back. I'm only being objective in how the situation played out and no biases here."
4,Great for High School Students Planning to Major in Business,"This is a great book for anybody that plans to major in business in college. The examples are great, and show step-by-step how each concept is done. Along with the working papers, you have a better understanding of how an accounting system operates."
3,it sticks,be careful where you put it because it sticks and is not coming off easily. Strong and sturdy. I used it for my toddlers play kitchen. We needed two hooks for her aprons.
1,Not good for all kids,"I used this book with my first child. It seemed to fit like a glove. Looking back I'm not so sure I did the best thing for him. He wasn't a big eater, and my milk supply dried up at 5 months. I think I would have been able to breast fed longer, and he would have been more healthy had I demand fed like I am with my second. My second son, has a ferocious appetite. There's no way, I'd be able to put him on this program without many tears from both the baby and I. It is not worth the undue stress to try to adhere to what in the author's opinion is the ""right way"" to do things. Plus, I have trouble keeping my milk supply, so this program is definately not good for that. My lactation consultant told me she's seen at least ten babies that needed serious intervention because they were not thriving due to being on this program."
1,"Buyer Beware! Results vary, but risks include Failure to Thrive & Dehydration!","As a conservative Christian, a mom, and a doula, I've extensively read parenting books, and have grave concerns about anything written by Ezzo (much of which I've read).Please research Gary Ezzo before following his advice. Google him, or go to [...] .His early infancy parenting advice is in direct conflict with the AAP, La Leche League and WHO on Breast feeding practices.Focus on the Family & the AAP have issued statements against his advice.In addition, his assertion that His way is God's way may make a person feel righteous for following it, but is much closer to spiritual abuse and control.Jesus way was to feed those who were hungry & to take special care for the children, loving on them, taking them on His lap, and blessing them."
1,"Founding church offers a review of ""Prep""","While many parents insist that ""Preparation for Parenting"" is as Biblical as it purports to be, the church where it all began does not allow it to be taught there any longer, in part due to theological problems and a lack of Biblical support for the infant management advice, such as schedule feeding, avoiding the use of slings, etc. For a brief statement of their major concerns, please visit http://www.fix.net/~rprewett/grace-ezzo.html"
1,Biblical? Nurturing?,"The subtitle of this book is misleading. One would expect that a ""Biblical Perspective"" would include, in the sections on breastfeeding, all of the passages in the Bible on that topic--or at least some of them. Instead, the approach to breastfeeding is based on someting completely outside of Scripture. Those who are familiar with the writing of men such as Luther Holt will recognize this approach to ""nurturing"": a schedule and rule-based method of getting baby to sleep through the night. The Ezzo Method is not only controversial in its misuse of Scripture, but in its misinformation about breastfeeding, infant development, and a host of other topics. I would urge parents to do a web search on ""Ezzo"" before buying this book"
3,It's ok,"This is just one of those books that is information overload. I simply wanted a book to tell me exactly what to do...did not need to know the philosophy behind sleep, etc. I finally found another book that got my son to sleep through the night called ""Moms On Call"". The sleeping part of MOC is only 5 pages! Preparation for Parenting is an entire book on sleep training."
1,And a child shall lead them...,"I prayfully ask that those considering this book, and others by Mr. Ezzo, will seek the truth. God is not a God of order, who demands that our children be put in a strict routine from birth. Our God is a nurturing and loving God who asks us to do the same. Jesus listened to the needs of the children and we shall do the same. This books asks us to put aside the Jesus side of God. Mr. Ezzo demands that we look at the old verson of God, where he was seen as a demanding and unforgiving God.Please, look into your heart and do a search on the web to see other sides of the story. If you're looking for a nurturing, Christian way of raising your children, search for books by Dr. William Sears."
1,Did not get it yet!,I would love to say that this is a great product and my transaction went well...however I still have not received it! I wrote numerous emails and got a response saying that the poster was damaged when it first arrived at Amazon and that a new one will be sent. ???? When? I ordered it over a month ago??
2,let down,"As someone learning to play drums and interested in African rhythms, I must say that this book was quite a let down. It offers very little useful information on drumming itself, and the ideas it does offer (the 12 principles) are expressed in uninteresting ways, lacking in subtlety. If you're interested in a book that offers insight into the meaning of African drumming, avoid this book and look to John Chernoff's African Rhythm and African Sensibility."
4,Christian Country/Blugrass at its Finest,"Interesting blend of materials, featuring old & new songs. Great pickin', as you would expect from a Ricky Skaggs project. Plaintive, hearfelt blugrass singing throughout. Liked the mixture of songs in 3/4 time, songs in minor keys and of course, the blugrass toe tappers. The Billy Graham intro does well to set up ""Are You Afraid to Die"" as an eternal question humanity must face."
5,This is so much fun!,"I bought this CD for my husband who really enjoys bluegrass, and now it is our absolute favorite. I can hardly keep myself from dancing when we turn it on! We listen to it all the time. ALL of the songs are great, which is unusual for any CD. It's a fun way to hear an important message."
5,Advanced Is Correct.,"This cream is thick & rich. Non greasy. Can be used on face, under eyes or any where your skin needs moisture. Highly recommended."
5,Butterscotch rules!,"I love Jello Cook & Serve pudding. I love the vanilla, chocolate, chocolate fudge and most of all, the butterscotch. Why don't they make it the 4.6 oz box like the others? It's a total mystery to me. I don't know how anyone eats instant pudding. I understand the convenience when you have children, but the memories created by the Cook & Serve version in my family, seem so much more valuable. Enjoy!"
4,Not quite as I remember,"I remembered this from when I was a kid and bought it because of that. It's delicious, but it's really, really sweet! So if that's something you might not like, be aware of that. Rather than a straight pudding, I think it might be nice as a filling layer in a cake, etc. I'm trying it that way the next time."
5,Butterscotch pudding,"I grew up with puddings that you had to cook. ""Instant"" had not been invented, yet. My husband knows I love butterscotch pudding, but could only find the instant kind. I looked online and found the ""cookable"" kind, so ordered it. It is not a big deal to cook it. By doing so, that ""instant"" taste that comes with uncooked is not there. I think that it would have been even better had I used whole milk, but being ""seniors"" who need to watch the calories, this is as good as it gets(I used fat free milk). Buying 24 boxes at a time is not a problem - it comes in a ""display"" box, which is good for storage."
1,THESE CRUTCHES ARE DANGEROUS; DON'T BUY!,"I purchased these crutches, and the forearms are not adjustable and too large. When my arms fall out of the crutches they basically fall off my arms in mid stride. They are not adjustable! Call me finicky, but when your crutches fall off, you no longer are walking with crutches. This is not good. I just bought another pair by Invacare. They are adjustable. (Duh.)"
3,i don't understand............,"I already bought this DVD in the beginning of february. And here it says release date April 24, that's funny.:)))))))))))))"
5,The way life is,"Yotsuba&! is a book about a young girl and her perspective on life. It does not focus entirely on Yotsuba, but dives into the other characters around her as well. The style of writing is not so much telling a story as it is presenting life as a little girl sees it. Things happen, and that's the way it is. It is not possible to read only one chapter."
3,Monster Trucks Rock !,"Picked this up for the boys, 8 & 12. It's been great. They were playing the free trial for a long time and bored of the single track. All the new trucks and courses have kept them thoroughly entertained. Graphics are same old nothing too fancy, but work fine. They're no ""free style"" arena ala Monster Jam, but plenty of opportunity to jump, crash & roll on the race courses and arena-like ""king of the hill"" platform courses. We're loving it."
3,yacker tracker,The tracker works great but the remote control is not working at all. Not a big problem for me. Though it would have been nice to get one that worked.
4,Not all great solutions come from left field,Thought provoking sections with practical ideas to consider.The following quote from the preface sums it up:Discovery consists of seeing what everyone else has seen and thinking what nobody has thought. -- Albert von Szent-Gyorgyi
2,Disappointing,"I'm a huge Cubs fan and was really disappointed in this book. The author spends less time talking about the Cubs and Wrigley than he does talking about his drinking escapades or the women he'd like to meet. He constantly berates the ""frat boys"" in Wrigleyville when he sounds like one himself. He's not insightful, he simply described (not that skillfully I might add) what all of us have experienced if we've ever set foot in Wrigleyville. I was hoping for something more original and insightful."
5,Cubs World,This book provides an excellent narrative of what it means to be a Cubs fan. It provides great insight for those who have never been to Wrigley Field.
1,Did this guy even go to high school?,I guess anyone can write a book these days. I bought the book for my husband and it sucked. So many words not even spelled right. PROOF READ!!!!!!!!!
3,Underwhelming,"I was really, really ready to like this book. It came recommended by the Blog Master, Al Yellon, of Bleed Cubbie Blue. And while I found it entertaining in parts, I realize I now find it hard to review because there just isn't any substance to this book. Yeah, the author, Kevin Kaduk, quits a sportswriting job it sounds like he was lucky to get, and then spends the next year living in Wrigleyville, unashamedly drinking copious amounts of alcohol and scamming tickets off scalpers to get into Cub games, a purported goal in his life. By the end of the book, it feels like Kaduk was as bored with the whole thing as I was. I kept waiting for something ""big"" to happen and it never did. For Kaduk's sake, I hope he's got his goals set a bit higher for the rest of his life. And in all seriousness, that was the best author's photo he could come up with?"
4,Great summer read to put you back at Clark & Addison.,"This is a good read for those of us waxing nostalgic for the neighborhood. If you're a Cubs fan and have enjoyed a day (or many) at Wrigley, you'll like this read. You're not going to learn much (really, did you expect to?) but you will be briefly transported to a game in the friendly confines. I'm not going to attempt to replicate Kaduk's feat any time soon but I think many of us have fantasized about quitting our jobs (at least for a day) in trade for a Cubs game (or whole season of them).This did wear on a bit toward the end but held my interest as something fun to read. Now on to something more serious."
5,Wrigley Is It's Own World,"Kaduk did a great job in bringing to life the atmosphere around Wrigley during a baseball season. This book has nothing to do with the Cubs as a team, but it's all about the park, the scalpers, the bars, the wretched suffering of Cubs fans everywhere. If anything, he might have written a little too much about the particulars of the game. All in all, this is a GREAT summer read and it makes you want to jump off the couch and head to one of the neighborhood bars for an ice cold Old Style....not necessarily to the park to watch the game....but definitely to it's surroundings to watch the people."
3,just an alright book,"Living in Wrigleyville it entertained me. He almost tries to sound too cool throughout the book. He's also a Cubs AND White Sox fan so his credit is ruined right there for a die hard Cubs fan. He also likes to make fun of ""young professionals,"" and about 95 percent of people that live in the area are exactly that- just like he used to be in Kansas City. It is entertaining but my summers here being around the same age seem to have more adventure. I really liked the book but dissapointed at the same time."
4,"Charming, subtle, intriguing","I'm not a big Pamela Dean fan -- I found most of her other books disappointing -- but this charming little gem is very different. Its a strange and somewhat quirky tale about a rural community under a magical spell. Because of this spell, designed to protect them from war and other atrocities of humanity, things are truly known by only one person among them. For example, to know if something is beautiful you'd have to ask the keeper of that knowledge -- you'd never be certain yourself until you were told, and even then, you'd just be parroting what someone who really knew told you. There's a lot of play here in discovering what learning, knowledge, memory, perception, and pain are, and how these change through the process of growing up and/or through experience. Its not perfect, and there are some flaws, but, this book is subtle, unique, and well worth reading."
2,Not what I had hoped/ expected/ wanted...,"My milage varies considerably from the other reviewers of this book. I finished it, but resentfully.I bought it because it was inexpensive and I didn't like Dean's _Tam Lin._ I wanted to give her another shot. I also was hoping, thinking that it would be like _The Giver._ Superficially, it is, but then it gets into the whole werewolf: should we or shouldn't we question. To me, it was a silly question, a silly simple society and characters I found I didn't care about.Rather than this I recommend Peter David's _Howling Mad._ It's about a wolf that gets bitten by a werewolf and becomes a man every full moon."
5,HOA is a contadiction in terms,"The book shows that HOA concept is a contradiction in terms: a business with no profit motive, a government with no balance of powers and no accountability mechanisms, a non-profit organization run by volunteers, yet with involuntary membership mandated by contract. None of the models fit, each has major flaws.All negative reviewers commented that the book did not provide solutions to the conflicts they had with HOA. Unfortunately, people who consider living in HOA never research the subject, and are completely unaware of what they are getting into.I highly recommend it to everyone who lives in HOA, especially to those who are HOA board members."
4,Very Enlightening if you can get over the Scholarly Blahhh!,"Read this book while doing research on how to amend our covenants in my HOA. It is an extremely interesting history of Covenants and CID's and what their job in the housing market truly is. I wish that he had not written it in such a stilted, scholarly fashion because more people should know the things in this book. There are very obscure quotes from very obscure historical figures (I assume) galore. I didn't know who a lot of those people were and often they were never explained. I found it very irritating because I felt the author was talking over my head for no good reason."
2,help needed in my community association,good information but a rather technical book. it lost me from time to time. good book for someone like a politician. but i would prefer something in everyday language i can relate to and with information that i can apply to where i live and i am looking for more of a 'self help' kind of a book.
1,Mediocre at best.,"This book was difficult to get through. It had some good information but nothing that we didn't know alreayd and for the most part it was so dry.We did read a book recently called ""Villa Appalling! Destroying the Myth of Affordable Community Living"". Not only was it easier to read but it actually had guidelines and helpful advice on how to live in homeowner associations and how to protect your money.That is what is important to us, how to protect our money."
2,Privatopia,The book was at times cumbersome and confusing. It deserves credit for being one of the first books written that discusses industry but it appeared to support industry rather than owners of property. I found it lacking in useful information for homeowners and lacking in information that consumers could readily use.
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed this product came on diskettes, rather than CDROM. Only one game is mouse driven. The PacMan game requires you to use the arrow keys, and they do not respond quickly enough. The old 80's joy sticks were better. Over priced for what you get."
4,"Blast from the past...my kids like it, too!","OK, I've seen the reviews by people who DON'T like this package..I understand their complaints...BUT..its fun..I enjoyed playing the games, so did my kids. They are easy to play and understand, easy to learn, and play JUST like the originals. You can play them with Joysticks, or with your keyboard, and, ask my 8 year-old, you can play them for hours, they are as fun as they were years ago."
3,Old Style Gaming,"This is old-style gaming. I have been trying to play with my arrow keys, because joysticks are not really made any longer for laptops.... I think I will just return to my my more up-to-date games. I really got this set of games for a novice computer user, who is part of that 80's generation. I wanted this person to get comfortable using a computer, keyboard, and was trying to make it fun. The seller provided a good quality product in a timely fashion, so no complaints on that end."
5,Amazing!,"I read this book, and it totaly helped me! I started my film, and learned so much from this book.The author must be some sort of g-d! He anwered nearly everyone of my questions. It actually changed the way i've been shooting.Thanks! If only you'll write some more books!"
5,Great Outdoor Cooking,The only problem I had with the volcano cook stove is no cooking instructions come with it. After recieving it I then ordered one of theLog Cabin cookbooks which tell how to use it. I used there guidelinesand made my own recipes. Don't use it as much as I would like as we areon the go alot. But I've fixed chicken and a hamburger casserole in it.Both got done with one batch of charcoal. One time I needed to fix a mealfor us and a meal to take so once one was done I added more charcoal waited a little for it to start good and put the second pot on. I did addlighter fluid to the charcoal before I added it. Great want to do more onit.
1,Item Arrived Bent And Vendor Will Not Respond! Beware!,"The volcano Stove arrived bent from shipping damage, I assume. I called and left voice mail for the vendor and they do not respond. They got my money this time but will never see another dime from me. Too bad, because I have never had a problem with an Amazon vendor prior to this purchase."
1,Don't waste your time,"If you liked Friends of Eddie Coyle like I did, don't think this is anything like it. Read Stephen King's On Writing instead."
2,My mistake,"I thought this would be like something like my wife gets, but not to be. It would work good on short hair, like a flat top. Too much Wax"
5,A treasure to find this album.,I have searched long and hard for this album. I never thought that i would find it. But i did. I am thrilled as punch. This is the coolest album cover ever and the music is pure genius. My album arrived on time and in perfect condition. Totally awesome. Rick James 4 Ever.
4,Nice book..,"I bought this book 2 weeks ago, and I spent an hour with it.Well and friendly written , good described concepts !.. for beginner like me. But I didn't find any European Brands such as (Trix or Fleischmann) samples in this book, you are understanding ""re-thing"" before realizing your own layout and scenery by N-Scale items.There is no lighting and electrical samples in the book.Just track feeding and wiring..A learned a lot of things from the Glossary.After all this is a nice book for beginner."
4,Great resource,"I LOVE that this book is spiral-bound. That is the best feature. It contains a wealth of information and the comments that he makes about the drinks are quite entertaining as well. The drink recipes range from basic ones that require a few simple ingredients to ""gourmet"" that require more than most people would have or want to buy. But with a little creativity, most can be suited to taste and budget. The title says it all---it is complete and it's a great, fun read, even if you're just a novice. Plus I bought it used for under $5-including shipping....now that's a steal!"
2,Horrible recipes!!!!,"I bought this because it seemed to have some uncommon recipes (for bourbon/whiskey). I tried them....oh my God, they were horrible!!!!! Cough medicine has more flavor!The standard, old fashioned recipes are fine, but don't give anything you can't get with a Google search. Some of the history and general mixing guidelines were nice. That's why I gave it two stars. There's got to be a better option than this."
2,"Cool to have, but useless","I thought this book would be really helpful to have, but I have never used it. The drinks are very involved and require multiple alcohols per drink. I don't keep much alcohol on hand, so it wasn't really realistic for me to make these types of drinks."
4,"Good read, despite...","I enjoyed the book and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to read about the ""average joe baseball player"". However, the tense it was written in is positively annoying and makes it hard to read some of the time. Instead of writing how real people would talk, like, ""So when you were in high school, what types of pitches were you throwing?"" he writes, ""You're in high school. What types of pitches are you now throwing?"" It's written as if you're in a hypnotherapy session and you're regressing your memories.Bottom line: Good book. Get a real editor."
5,Not only superstars have interesting and moving stories,"I was absolutly amaze by this book. Reading about how the baseball world works, how hope is shattered, what sacrifice it takes to make it ever so briefly to the ""Show"" was fantastic. Any baseball fan should know about Bill Pierro's story. This book is not less important than any other baseball best-selling book, in fact, you have here the true story, related by 18 individuals who realized their dreams...only to be denied.A MUST READ for any student of the game."
5,Great all around composing tool,"I have been a Sibelius user for several years, and find it a very useful tool for composition and classroom instruction. The relatively new feature of being able to quickly save your composition as a WAV file makes it easy to give students take home practice CDs (using sampled sounds not midi tone).Another useful new feature is the ability to score a soundtrack to a movie while never leaving Sibelius. You can directly import many movie file formats and add music and sound effects easily.I highly recommend this program, and make sure you get the latest version for all the new features."
5,wonderful!,I wonder why we don't have more Russian authors translated. Those who do not like SCIFI will be instantly converted. An excellent book.
5,Should we sue Random House???,"Spectacular work, but....It is now 7 years that I have been waiting for this dictionary to be completed. I am now hearing that the third and last volume may not see light at all. The mere thought that Random House has brought its customers into a stupid situation like this is shocking. Not only it's a huge disappointment to its customers, but it's also a great loss to American lexicography. Does Random House think that this fiasco can me mended in the not too distant future? May we readers and customers expect a reply from Random House? What the hell.Does anybody know whether the deal between Random House and a British publisher, aimed at publishing the third volume was finally made?"
4,A Lost Gem,"This is a book I wish someone would have recommended to me 10 or 15 years ago. Oh well... (I just found it a few minutes ago on a shelf of free books in a laundry mat.)Anyway, here are the 3 ""unvarying"" principles from page 5:1) NEVER write about a topic that you do not believe is worth discussing.2) NEVER say anything as you write that you do not honestly believe.3) NEVER use any of the rhetorical elements or devices we shall study unless they efficiently operate to let you say what you want to say to the reader you want to address in the simplest, most direct, clearest possible way."
4,Good but...,"First off, Age of Empires is an amazing strategy and war game. I can't even begin to describe how much you should get this game.However, the version I got didn't come with the owner's manual and history. I owned a version for Mac (this versions pc) but the manuals really add a lot the the game. Make sure the copy you buy includes them. Thats my only complaint."
2,"Addictive, nice graphics, but mostly impossible to ""win"" at","The first 6 times I played this game was enjoyable...even though I never was ""victorious"" even at the ""easiest"" difficulty level. But, being a patient, tenacious, and fairly intelligent person I just KNEW that I'd be victorious sooner or later, so I kept playing. After a dozen more times I was only able to ""win"" once. If you buy this game, I'd recommend playing it online with other humans. Because trying to win in the single-player mode is practically impossible."
5,THIS GAME RULES!,"This game wipes out all other strategy games. The best thing about Gold edition is that you can choose from main game, scenario, random map,death match,also if you want you can build your own scenario with scenerio builder. Another thing about this game is you get the original game and the expanion which you can play either. I WOULD RECCOMEND YOU BUY THIS GAME IF YOU LOVE STRATEGY GAMES, OR IF YOUR JUST LOOKING FOR A GOOD GAME."
5,awsome!,"For all of you who like warefare and empire building (also patince) you will love this game! you start out (this is on radom map) with 3 dudes and you build an expanding empire under you're countrol! Now I have not played on the web but I hear that's cool too!Also, before I go play it, here are some cheat codes since your always running out of recorses.1 PEPPERONI PIZZA=1000 FOOD 2 COINAGE=1000 GOLD 3 WOODSTOCK= 1000 WOOD 4 QUARRY= 1000 STONE 5 GAIA= COUNTROL OVER ANIMALS AND 6 PHOTON MAN= GUY WITH LASER."
5,Great Game for Great PLayers,"...I absoultly love Age of Empires, and other simulation games. My friend has it, my camp has it, it is UNBELIVABLE. Great graphics, a good motive, and I don't care that this review isn't very helpful. All that I need to say is. . .GET THIS GAME! YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!"
5,Age Of Empires!,"/\ By: GuStAvE \\//\\ ////--\\ \\// \\ //// \\GE OF EMPIRES: GOLD \\====================================//A great game that will last you a longtime, I think this is good for beginnersand has plenty of options. It is a greatgame with plenty of units and stuff. Ithas different countries and things likethat. It will last you for ages becauseof the huge campaigns and stuff it alsois quite addictive,especially with thecheats. You have to do things like: Foragefor berries, hunt animals, mine gold and stoneand also trade items to build your city up. Youcan upgrade weapons and things like that. Youcan build walls and watchtowers to keep intrudersout and so on... I reccommend this to anyone wholikes Real Time Strategy. 9.5/10 :)"
4,Good game for an old game,This game was one of my favorite games for a LONG time after I got it. The missions are good and it's very easy to play. The only big error is the fact that the population is limited to 50.
5,The ending....yeah,"I almost turned this movie off half way through the first time I watched it. Its not the scariest film you'll ever watch, the ghosts are sneaky but the characters seem to have a hard time figuring out theyre ghost, even though you see them a lot. I dont want to give away anything, but the ending was what made me love this movie and watch it again. I had this moment where everything about the movie just became cool."
3,chilling,"I found this film very surreal and twisted, yes the film was not so bad and the blood and guts were everywhere but i believe that the relationship between the two boys could have been develped better. Cute"
2,"Nice story, but...","This looked like a very interesting story, and it is. If they had a few million bucks they could have made a great film out of this story. So, while the story is there, the production values are, um, lacking to say the least. I appreciate independant film makers, and I give Leopoldo Laborde credit for getting this one out there. I'm sure his later films are just fine. This film was made with no lighting (which is why everything happens during the day), no microphones save the one ""on the camera"", and I have a feeling he used his own house for the set. The subtitles get a little humorous with typos. Overall the low-budget nature becomes just distracting, taking the viewers mind off of the story, which is fairly well played."
1,PAINFUL,"This game is so easy sometimes and yet extremely difficult when it's not supposed to be. The lie has no effect on the distance. You can chip in 9 out of 10 times around the green. If you are in the woods, forget it. There is no way to judge your lie. There is no difference in swing speed between a driver and a wedge. All clubs swing the same exact way. I gave the game away."
3,too easy,"A fine golf game for the money but it's a bit too easy to score well. Also, difficult to accurately read putts. Flight distance does not take lie into account (you hit as far from the rough as from the fairway)."
4,A courageous and essential effort,Joan Mandle has done an excellent job at synthesizing for the reader what types of conflicts and miscommunications lie fundamental to the core of struggling women's studies programs. Her account of a case study (memoirs of a campus struggle) is important reading for anyone interested in truly examining and furthering the state of women's studies programs in today's liberal arts curriculum.
3,Odd little book,"This is worth a read if you're interested in the whole Wimmin's Studies cult phenomenon. But there's much to puzzle about here too. Prof Mandle took the helm of the WS program at Colgate determined to drag it out of its sectarian isolation, impose scholarly standards, and build bridges to the secular branches of the humanities and even the sciences. At every turn the True Believers fought her and accused of her of straying from the path of ideological purity. In the end, there was a coup and she got dumped.It makes for an interesting enough tale, but I was left scratching my head as to Mandle's motivations. Did she really expect to effect a lasting clean-up of that stable?"
3,A semi-interesting diversion for fans only.,"While only a marginal fantasy novel, fans of the show may enjoy the brief moments when the flavor of the show is captured. Other times, the main characters (Hercules and Iolaus) don't really act like themselves and there's not much tension. The supporting characters are rather weak and somewhat stereotypical. It's a pity, but the book seems to be geared toward a very young audience and thus may hold its greatest appeal in a pre-teen to teen market segment. Check out the synopsis for a plot summary. [Note: This is my first attempt at reading a novel based on this show, which I happen to really like, and will be giving another book in the series a try]"
4,Great Mic,"THis microphone is perfect. Great range and does not eat batteries. 4 stars instead of 5 because the clip broke right after I got it, was not built real strong."
1,Did not work,The unit did not work with my camera. I would like to return it and get my money back. Thank you.
4,Amazing if you have the right camcorder,"You can find these for $30-$50 easily now. If you have a compatible Sony camcorder, it's a terrific buy. Sound quality is amazing bang for your buck and the mic easily and unobtrusively attaches to the subject. I would have given 5-stars if battery life was a little better, it was rechargeable and if the mic was a tad smaller. But really- as is, its a great product and value."
3,worked great until delicate connection broke,"i literally couldn't believe how well this cheap little wireless mic worked -- all the positive reviews are spot-on. but as soon as i put it on the first time and saw how delicate the connection the receiver is to the camera, i wondered how long it would last. not long, as it turns out. i have no idea why Sony needed to make the tiniest of connector pieces. i have no idea if i can return it, since it's been just over a year. i'm going to try and i'll keep you posted, but it just frustrates me that these days people make stuff so they'll break; thus, forcing you to buy another. oh well."
3,Sony Bluetooth ECMW1 Wireless Mic,"I have been using this mic for about 2 years. It works fine as a remote mic but it has it's limits. Considering the options I had, I would purchase it again. I have a Sony HD Camcorder that has a proprietary mic jack, so it's better than nothing.. and it's not that expensive. Regular AA batteries last less than 1 1/2 hours. If you use lithium batteries you can get 2+ hours use. It does a real good job picking up the sound from 50 ft away... haven't used it for further distances. It a bit clumsy to put on a lapel or coattail during a wedding. I have been hiding it in the area for some video sessions. It works better than using the mic on the Camcorder."
5,Price is misleading,"This is not a review of the product, but a review of the product information. The ""retail price"" shown above for this product is $327.38 which is discounted here by an 'advertised' 61%. But it can be purchased directly from the Sony website for $199. The price here is still significantly lower, but not anywhere near the reported 61% lower. To me, this seems deliberately misleading and smells of 'cheesy' merchandising but perhaps it's just an oversight."
2,Buyer Beware,"I wrote Sony asking if this item was compatible with my Sony Camcorder because the website information was unclear. The Sony rep. assured me it was, so I bought the mic...it wasn't compatible. After causing a stink with Sony, all they said is that they were not responsible for the website info or the rep."
1,Hi -czzcck- this mic -cczzzckck- sucks,The microphone is HUGE. This thing looks like it is some sort of medical device hanging on you. It does do a good job picking up tons of ambient noise and static though. So if you are looking for a good mic for all the noise around you - this is it!
4,Microphone - SR 80,I used this microphone wiht My DCR - SR80. I used this when I had an outside wedding. It was great. There was a few times where it cut out but I think it was because it was in my husbands pocket. I would recommend this product if you taping anything outside where you need to hear people. The only downfall is its expensive. I actually received it free because I bought the DCR - SR80 from Amazon.
5,What a difference !!!!!,"This has completly changed the way I hear sound from the recorded videos. I think this is a marvel of an invention, hats of to SONY"
4,A decent consumer grade wireless mic,"Too often, otherwise good content is diminished because of poor audio.This device is an excellent way to get better audio. I've used it successfully with a subject over 100 feet from the camera. It's made of plastic. So don't skate board with it."
3,Wireless Microphone,Using this Wireless microphone enable me to get better sound effect. Good product.
1,scenery,THIS SCENERY DESIGNER IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST PROGRAM I HAVE EVER PURCHASED IF I WERE YOU DONT GET IT YOU WOULD BE WASTING YOUR MONEY.
3,An OK Book,"While I don't think S&S 17 will go down in the annals of history as one of the great works of literature in our time, it is worth reading. It's good for reading on lunch breaks or other times when you don't have several uninterrupted hours for a good solid read.As with all anthologies, there are submissions that appeal to my sense of ""good story"" more than others. My personal favorite from this one was Carrie Vaughn's ""Haunting of Princess Elizabeth."""
1,Horrible,"These pantyhose are horrible....... walk 100 yards and they are around your knees if you aren't tugging at them to keep them on.I got to the airport and took them off, threw them in the trash and then went bare-legged the rest of the day. I will NEVER buy these again."
1,made in china at same price as made in usa?,"Givenchy, please go back to your original sizing and factories in the USA or Italy. Or reduce the price the 4"" the pantyhose have been reduced when made in China. The quality has gone so far downhill. How did you allow the Givenchy name to go onto such an inferior product? I wear a B in the 575. I tried the E, yes, that is correct, E(made in China) and they still did not stay at my waist, because they were too short. 5'2"", 112 lbs! Fix it!"
1,DON'T EVEN!!!,"$10 a pair r u kidding me?? I have a million different kinds of panythose and these were a joke!! First time sliding my foot in I got a run! You'd be better off going to JCPenny, better hose and cheaper too..Oh by the way the color was a ashy tan color if thats what you like? Dont waste your money!!!"
1,Worst Movie Ever,"I bought this movie because I knew Virginia Capers and her name was boldly placed on the front of the packaging. She had two lines in this movie!!! Plus, the production quality is that of a homemade porno. If I could give it negative stars, I would!!!"
4,A good Christmas read,"After reading this story I would give it 4 stars. It was a good novel, and a feel good Christmas story, which was exactly what I was hoping for. The downside to the story is that it felt somewhat predictable, as if I had heard or read the story before (which I haven't) and could mostly remember the outcome but not quite. So no huge surprises. But it did help put me in the Christmas mood, and when I was done with it I was glad that I had read it. It is a free book, and doesn't have a table of contents, but it is not a huge read, so it doesn't really need one in my opinion."
3,The Christmas Angel,This was a very sweet story which teaches one about the gift of giving and how not to harbour bitterness.One can read this short story in a day.A good story to be read to children of the ages 8 - 12
5,"Same Christmas message differently done, nice","I really enjoyed this Christmas story. It's a take on the ""bah-humbug"" character. Similar to another Christmas story.Nicely worded, good story flow and fun to read. The curiosity of the main character pulls you into the book. I startedreading and kept going till the end - a happy end at that."
3,It's OK...,"It's a nice repetition of Dickens Scrooge, but viewed differently. Nice for a children's story. Nice story for the Christmas season"
3,"Simple, enjoyable story","This nice, old-fashioned story was one I enjoyed reading. It was not, however, one that I will read every Christmas. It did pleasantly fill in the time between going to bed and going to sleep."
1,Poor copy of Christmas Carol,"This was a poor copy of A Christmas Carol. A woman instead of Mr.Scrooge, poor kids, bah humbugs, etc. I quit reading after just 10 pages."
5,a psychic smorgasbord,"Sarvananda Bluestone is a rare combination: a gifted psychic who is also a scholar, and a scholar whose clear and lively writing style is accessible to all. In How To Read Signs and Omens in Everyday Life, Dr. Bluestone offers a smorgasbord of fun, easy, and magical games with which anyone can tap into the latent sixth sense that is our birthright as humans. --Helen Weaver, author"
4,Pearls in this oyster,"At first sight this looks like any other old (1979) book on sampling for auditors, and it isn't at all easy to read. However, the methods described are simple and powerful - much more so than many others in the literature, and well worth the effort. Strategic application could save your organisation squillions. There is enough detailed mathematical and audit-related supporting argument to convince the worst doubters that the authors (Leslie, Teitlebaum, and Anderson) really knew what they were talking about."
3,"A good sequel, but it's no masterpiece like the original.","This sequel is quite diffrent from the original. Actually, it's nothing like the original. There's a surprise ending, but that's pretty much where the similarities (besides Norman) of the original end. Norman Bates' character is greatly alterted. He is no longer the tender, lovable character of the original. He's, in fact, quite unlikable. A cold-blooded killer, unlike the original, where his killings where not his own, so to speak (mother is gone in this one). He's your average slaughteror, a Jason type character you could say. This turned me off to the book a little, but besides that, this book is ALMOST as good as the original. The surprise ending is better than the first's, in my opinion, and the story is quite intresting. But if your looking for a better Psycho sequel, I'd suggest Psycho House."
5,An under-rated book and author,"If you loved Psycho then you will also love Psycho II. Psycho House isn't bad either. Readers just get so absorbed in Bloch's writing and storyline. This story is set for the current day, or rather the day the book was written, and takes you from the dark and rainy mental hospital to the glamour of Hollywood. It keeps you guessing all the way to the end and you will find yourself running back to the bookstore (or logging on)to get the 3rd installment. I just wish there was a 4th! The character of Norman Bates is incredible!"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Also possessed by sequelitis.While the first Psycho novel is a pretty good book, this one is only half the book the first was, at least in quality, as you can see by the rating.Norman escapes and goes all Slasher, which is really not why it was interesting to start with."
1,Short and Simple,"This was my first experience in games of this genre, and I'm rather disappointed (I'm more of a fan of the likes of Ultima, Homeworld). In both P1 and P2 the story lines are exciting, but the overall puzzles presented are rather simple. The control panel in P2 was the most difficult, and it was more annoying rather than challenging. The interface also makes for a rather liniar, simplistic game. My greatest complaint, however, is the time it takes to complete the games. Each game took less than 10 hours to complete, and they have absolutely no replay value. Perhaps a newer game in this genre would be more satisfying (Blood of the Sacred..., et. al.)I returned the game to Sierra, and got my money back."
3,"Good puzzles, but FAR too gory","This series has a lot to offer, but the clever puzzles, interesting interface, and almost good enough writing aren't quite enough to make up for the really overdone and hideous (and not particularly logical) violence. P1 also bears the burden of aiming all the violence towards women, most of whom are mindlessly chirpy and submissive. P2 is more blatant and just celebrates gore as an end in itself. Unless you're a fan of the ""blood & guts/woman in peril/shock me baby"" genre, you're not likely to be enchanted by the series."
3,Lovecraft stylistics with King's idleness,"Honestly, I was disappointed by the game.The 7 CD pack goes away in less than 3 hours and so vanish the money and all hopes for a week's creep show.The game lacks the least amount of imagination which would fill in the first 4 CDs of an average perfomance. But the laziness of Roberta Williams was evidently packed up by plenty of running around the castle and 4 houses of the nearest village.Despite the miss in scenario, I would suggest running through the game for 2 basic reasons: to enjoy one of the rare samples of a plain storytelling computer implementation, and... to have your friends freak with a ravenous story-ending."
2,Nice Blade,I bought this product because I made the mistake of buying a black car. I always have water spots after it drys. Inow use a rinse that helps the water not bead up and I get far fewer spots on the vertical sufaces then without the spot aditive. I got the blade to run over the enitre car after I wash an area. It does an okay job but not any better then the window blade I was using before @ $5. This blade has a nice feel to it and a smaller tip for the mirrors.This should last a long time but I don't think I would buy another one.
1,Doesn't Work!!,"It was not designed stiff enough, so you must use 2 hands to hold the top and bottom. I'm looking for another type that works!"
4,Its different than the original but works as good.,Its different than the original but works as good. I do like the addition of the little blade on the end to use on mirrors and tight spots on the car.
1,Oh no,"this is the most pretentious and hollow book I have ever read, and to think it came so highly recommended. If there is such a thing as prog-litterature then this almost certainly is a prime example."
4,Does the job,"Nothing bad to say...It does the job, holds all of my desk items....Looks okay on my desk. Not necessarily expensive looking, but I don't suppose it needs to be."
5,Strong and sturdy,"I don't like clutter in my cube so this was a great solution without taking up a lot of space. I keep my altoids, pack of gum, post it notes, binder clips, and blotting papers in the compartments. The section where the writing utensils are kept are divided into three so I keep my highlighters, pencils, and pens separated."
5,"Much Better than I expected, which is rare. Awesome Value.","Much Better than I expected, which is rare. Awesome Value.This is so well made and VERY stable. Just the tape dispenserintegration is a great space saver! Ordering two for each ofmy family members, office and home."
4,ALMOST Great!!,"I really wanted this particular unit for my home office and found I could not buy it locally. This was the BEST price and it arrived AMAIZINGLY (almost FREAKISHLY) FAST!!! LOVE IT! The only thing I would note, and believe me this is minor, is that it came with only 2 post-it flags versus the four it says comes with the unit in the description. NOT A BIGGIE at all!! Great condition and awesome shipping!!!!"
1,Poorly designed. Please do not waste your money.,After using this organizer for ONE day I am annoyed. It does not have enough weight for me to pull tape without holding the organizer with other hand. Whatever I put it underneath the tape dispenser I will accidently remove it when cutting the tape. I wasted my money and I don't want you to do the same.
5,Fun for all ages!,"I'm a 6-10th grade Spanish teacher in Hong Kong. My students love this game. My only regret is not getting a class set. That's on my list of things to do. Because the game is bilingual, I can have the students play in Spanish, all the while learning what they mean because the English is alongside. It's the perfect way to for students to learn and have fun. Anytime I mention that we're having a game session, students immediately run for Maya & Miguel's Word Scramble. If you don't have it in the classroom, GET IT!"
5,My favorite book when I was 3,"This was my favorite book when I was a young child. My mother says that I demanded that she read it to me every night. It's about a kitten who doesn't fit in with the other kittens, so he goes around the farm seeing if he'd be a better duck, chicken, etc. But he nearly drowns when the ducks go swimming (the ducks save him), and so on. In the end he comes home and is happy to be a kitten with his family. Looking back now that I'm 41, Pitschi's adventures symbolize much of my life. It's surprising to think that when I was 3 I must have had some idea of the future ""story of my life.""--Review by Thomas David Kehoe, author of ""Hearts and Minds: How Our Brains Are Hardwired for Relationships"""
5,"Timeless, tasteful collection of children's songs","In l967 I discovered the first of four Babysitter Albums, while rummaging around in a bin of children's On Sale LP records. I had been searching for children's music for my pre-school youngsters, and had not been able to find other than raspy, colorless, unmelodic ""sing songs"" - usually under the Disney label. But, THIS one was chock full of a large variety of styles and arrangements which held interest not only of children but of adults as well. Furthermore, all four albums turned out to be as amazingly good. My children eventually out-grew these albums, but I have kept them - even copied them onto audiotapes in order to preserve their beauty. Now I am searching for the composite CD, in order to introduce a grandchild to music. What better way is there than through this treasure chest of beautiful, tasteful melodies and harmonies arranged in imaginative, humorous ways?"
5,a fabulous childrens album,"I remember this from my childhood and when I read the song list here I realised I still remembered all the words. I loved it then, and I really wanted to get it for my children. I hope it gets reissued"
5,This was a happy discovery when I was little.,"There are many fine children's albums, but this is certainly the top ten. Our friend gave us a copy, and we listened to it in the car and at home too. There are folk songs for babies, children, parents, and babysitters. Songs include lullabies, fingerplays, silly songs, and more. I would like to buy one as a gift, and I hope the label always makes it available."
5,Beautiful and extremely well made,"This cast-iron pot I regularly use to cook meals (usingGlorious One-Pot Meals: A Revolutionary New Quick and Healthy Approach to Dutch-Oven Cooking. With that, I can cook 3-4 complete meals (starch, protein, and vegetables) in 45 minutes in a 450F oven. This unit is MUCH better than Le Creuset: it's heavier, the finish seems better, and it comes with a good metal handle. (Le Crueset uses a plastic handle and charges $10 extra to get a metal handle.)"
3,WHERE IS DIANA,"WHEN I GOT THE TAPE I VIEWED IT AND I WAS HAPPY AND DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE MIRROR MIRROR , EATEN ALIVE, AND CHAIN REACTION WERE NOT ON THE TAPE. WHAT HAPPENED, I LOVE DIANA BUT WHERE ARE THE VIDEOS PLEASE HELP ME WITH THIS."
5,She's The Boss,Any fan of Diana will enjoy this package of videos. I only wish she would have others released for she has so many throughout her 40+ year career.Excellent watching
5,Wake up America !,"5 platinum stars for the artist ... Wake up America : Diana ROSS is one of your purest diamonds !!! You could do a lot better to show the world that you care. Diana ROSS is part of your music history and part our hearts too. We're thousands and thousands of fans all over the world awaiting to see more than that on DVD : A ""One Woman"" video collection with bonus like ""Take me higher"", ""I will survive"", ""Not over you yet"" and many more ... Concerts like the Caesars Palace but a real DVD this time, and how about the magical Central Park concert (Day one AND two), ... ? At least, PLEASE, do not forget masterpieces like ""Lady sings the blues"", ""Mahogany"" and ""Out of darkness"" !!! (Oh one last thing ... subtitles !). Thanks !A fan from FRANCE."
3,pretty good,with the impact Diana Ross has had you kinda expect a bit more because Her Career has been quite long&oyu expect a few more things to Highlight Her.this set is pretty good though&Hopefully there will be a more Complete package the next me. She is the link between Donna Summer-Beyonce.
3,Asklng for a blu-ray video.,"""Visions of Diana Ross"" DVD goes by quickly with only six of her music videos shown.DVD quality is that of an older DVD, grainy and slightly blurry on hi-def TV.I really wish someone would issue some blu-rays of this excellent artist."
4,A good book for beginning investors,"This book is divided into several sections, with each section concerntrate on different strategies on how to plan your financials wisely. It also gives good investment tips. A good book for beginning investors and those who don't have a tight financial plan yet."
5,Great book for fans of inspiring stories,"This book is a great read for both Carolina and opposing teams' fans. I bought it for my wife (a North Carolina grad) and ended up loving it myself (UNC Charlotte graduate). The story on Charles Scott - the first black athlete on the UNC basketball program - is especially inspiring. The book is filled with great stories on success in sports, business and life outside of both.Scott Fowler is one of the best sports writers and storytellers in the country and we are fortunate to have him in the Charlotte area. This book is like reading 36 of his best columns."
4,North Carolina Tar Heels: Where Have You Gone,"Excellent ""bringing back the memories"" of some familiar faces in Tar Heel history.Nice to be able to hear from them in past and present tense. A wonderful edition to my library."
3,It was Okay,"The condition wasn't the best. They said it was acceptable, but the cover was a little sticky, probably from some kind of sticker that was on there but they could have taken a minute to wipe it off."
4,"Fun read, but take it with a grain of salt","After reading this book I realized that, in some respects, I have already found my inner French girl. In other ways, I never will. This is because my hectic, American life does not allow for things like five weeks of vacation or having two-hour dinners every night that are made from scratch from the freshest ingredients the farmer's market had to offer that day. Although the author arguably has to put forth an ideal (because why the heck would you want to model yourself after something commonplace and mediocre?), the images of the women presented are a bit fantastical. So, French Girl, I will gladly have some of your real butter, but I'm also keeping my bagged salad."
2,Whatever,"I'm kind of unconvinced by the basic premise of this book. It says Jeanne D'Arc was the first woman warrior. Whatever. Hahahahaha. I speak French, and I like different culture exploration, like most people. But- she says that at one point she wanted to die and be reborn French. It has redeeming qualities, but this kind of thing shouldn't be published, it should be in a blog, not in the market. I wonder if there are people in France buying books that say ""How to discover your inner American woman"". It makes, this book, out of being French, an unequivocable quality, like being happy or being sad. That is lite non fiction at best. Something for the plane, at least. Musn't be too harsh on it, it is cute. Worst things have been published.... oh yes. Everyday. What can we do."
5,Much more than style,"I bought this book wanting a book on French style. I got a whole lot more! Filled with anecdotes, film and book suggestions and 'French Girls we love', it is a fascinating read. Most importantly, Ollivier gives us practical ways to achieve that je ne sais quoi.A lovely book, which you will continue to dip into again and again when you are feeling a little lost or a bit too Anglo-Saxon!"
4,Fun and informative,"Helped me understand my Parisian friend's reticence and indefinable style.Very readable. Not too deep. Sometimes I envied the french girls, and sometimes I was glad I wasn't one of them.Don't come looking for fashion advice, this isn't it. More of a day in the life book. (I'm still looking for a book that will help me acquire with the skill French women have with scarves. - C'est la vie!)"
4,Bien,"Je l'aime bien. This book offered an indepth observation in the difference between the archetypal french mentality with the American mentality. I enjoyed the first 60 pages of the book, rad through that part fast/. The part of motherhood, children, cooking and dining were less enjoyable but nonetheless gave insight to the french perspective. I did not like all the little boxes of recommendations and pictures.I did not feel like the author knew what she wanted to do with the book. It seemed contradictory at times and without a central goal despite the astute insight and observation."
2,Silk mou-mous,"It's all very well telling uncultured, non-French women that they, too, can be glamorous, mythic and mysterious, but I don't know that incorporating French style and culture into your life is really all it's cracked up to be. After perusing this publication, my wife has begun dining on sliced pig's trotters, substituting perfume for basic cleanliness, and pouting rudely at anyone who smiles at her in the street. She's become passionate about fondue and unwatchable experimental black & white films. She has also professed a previously absent desire to collaborate with Nazis. And best not get me started on the silk mou-mous and padded zebra-skin mules..."
4,What else can I say?...,"I enjoyed the book. I too have learned a lot about entertaining good friends, food, style, and living from my French husband and all of my French friends in Abidjan, Ivory Coast and in Paris.One critism: the author's Kir recipe (a personal fave): white wine, creme de cassis and a ""twist of lemon"". I've never, anywhere been served a Kir with a twist of lemon."
5,Fabulous Insights,"Entre Nous is an innovating book that captures the femininity and admiration of the French woman. From tips to ways of life, this book focuses on the importance the French girl puts on food, life, and play. Throughout the text, the author recommends books and films that capture the essence of the topics at hand.This book will help to change the way one thinks of her work. It will also help one to encourage relaxation, to take life slow, and enjoy the pleasures life has to offer."
2,Je m'appelle BORED & IRRITATED,"I bought this book at the suggestion of a clerk at Anthropologie. Next time I'll go to a bookstore for a recommendation!It's a fawning love story about French ""girls"". Throughout the book I kept thinking ""EVERY French girl is like this? No exceptions?"" Her description is an idealized version of French women. It grew tiresome about halfway into the book.I've lived in Europe, and yes, cultures and customs are unique. People do things differently in Europe than they do in the US. Does that make Europe superior? According to the author and her French friends, the answer is yes. Americans are loud, brash, too busy, and have too many cereal choices.Why doesn't the author write about French hygiene habits, their incessant smoking, and their entitlement-based, socialist government?"
2,superficial,"I was very disappointed with this book. Although the portrays of French girls the author gives are not wrong, they are more stereotypes. Instead of giving interesting and original observations of French, the auther just gives individual episodes on French girls do this, Americans do that, which are not even original and seem to be like examples that fit those stereotypes. Maybe this will be a good starting point, but if you really want to know why and how French girls do it, there are much better books out like Frederic Fekkai's A Year of Style or Geneviere Antonine Dariaux's A Guide to Elegance. Finally, if you believe that the author knows French in and out because she is married to a French and lived in France for 10 years, as I did when I bought this book, unfortunately it just shows that if someone does not have an observant eye, living ten years does not improve that."
5,One of my favourites!,I really love this book and have re-read it a few times already. It's sensual and cheery and great for the self-esteem. It reminds me to enjoy and celebrate my femininity. An absolute joy to read. The recipes are great too!
2,Abroad.,"I'm in Paris right now. And I have to admit, that before I arrived here, I had visions of berets, perfect stockings, cigarettes, and street accordions dancing in my head. But I'm getting this feeling that it is basically the same everywhere, at least in cities. There will be large department stores, chains of McDonalds, KFC, Starbucks, homeless people, fat people, scruffy people. Which is of course a ""duh"". The characteristics that Ollivier attribute to French girls can really be seen everywhere; New York, Rome, London, Chicago etc. Girls honestly look the same everywhere generally; boots with slim jeans or pants tucked in, wearing a short fitted jacket, yada yada. So really. Stop being such a poser. You're only embarrassing yourself by denouncing your origins and who you really are."
2,Repetitive and Rapturous,"This book is simply one long gush about how great french women are with broad generalizations. Although each chapter is supposed to focus on something new, I felt like she was repeating herself over and over to get a whole book out of this topic. Of more interest than the book's actual prose are the book, movie, and recipe suggestions. Instead of asides, they should have been the substance of the book, otherwise, there is not much here and I'm sad I paid for this."
5,Delicious,I find myself coming back to this book time and again. It's well written and it's kind of a self-help book in how to be less hung-up on the things we Americans are so often hung-up on and just enjoy life like a French lady. It always puts me in a good mood when I read it.
4,Delightful and informative,I thought this book a delightful and easy read. I read it in one day. I found it entertaining and insightful.
2,Not worth it.,"The written descriptions are useful, but I was expecting to get real pictures of how to tie the knot and not only very bad drawings.Sorry, not a good product."
2,Kind of a letdown... a little,"I totally didn't have a problem with the seller or anything, great shipping! Um, but, the book kinda rots. If you know how to tie a tie already, then it might be fine, but I don't. The pictures didn't really help, and the wording wasn't concise. One sentence could be interpreted like nine ways!! I practically destroyed one tie, definitely practice with a tie you don't care about or one that doesnt need to be dry-cleaned, cuz they get pretty rumpled."
1,If you really want to know how to tie a necktie.....,"Go to You Tube and type ""How to tie a necktie"" in the search box or better still type ""Windsor Knot"" in there.Even the worst You Tube video on this subject is better than this book. In fact I recommend that you copy the search terms above now and go to You Tube rather than waste money on this book.If I had relied on this book to teach me how to tie a Windsor knot in a necktie I would have given up long ago.The instructions make little sense. I only paid a dollar for this book but believe me it's not worth even a dollar. Oh yes it does show 14 ways to tie but most of them you will never use. You only need to learn two types of knots. The half Windsor (easy) or the full Windsor (difficult). They do have a section here on how to tie a bow tie but I sure would not want to try it using this book's description."
1,Bon Jovi CMT Pick,"Should have read the reviews!!! I got so excited thinking I'd found the ACTUAL CMT CrossRoads Television video of Bon Jovi and Sugarland, I just ordered it. Totally bogus. Only 1 song do they sing and play together on this video. On the REAL CMT CrossRoads they played 8! I found it yesterday at [...].I don't have it yet so can't testify that it's great, but I'm hoping to not get ripped off again.This item here on Amazon should be removed from this site as packaged."
1,not what you think,not the bon jovi sugarland cd as broadcast on CMT...........its some other live concert with a guest appearance by sugarland
1,recived wrong cd,wanted other bon jovi with sugerland blah blah blah blah blah blah blah this review sucks . must not want real feedback
3,Not sure it's better,"I'm not so sure this DVD was a better production, than the first. I'll be trying it out on a different screen in the future."
3,Half-assery at it's finest!!!,"I'm not the biggest Ghost in the Shell fan of all time or anything but I enjoy the story very much. I've had it on VHS, DVD & got it for a good price on blu-ray. Honestly I was pretty good with the DVD version I have but looking at the back of the case I read: ALL THE ORIGINAL ANIMATIONS ARE RE-PRODUCED WITH LATEST DIGITAL FILM AND ANIMATION TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING 3D-CGI.you would think the whole movie has been redone in 3D-CGI, but no... it's only bits and pieces here and there and it makes it seem like a totally arbitrary choice. Thankfully they included the Original movie in the special features."
2,Ghost in the Shell 1.3,"I rented this expecting an visual overall of the film. It's just about three scenes in full 3D CGI where as the rest of the film is simply ""cleaned up"". I didnt want anyone else mislead with this ""2.0"" edition. I'm glad that I did not purchase this again."
3,Not a step up,"I have to say, I'm pretty disappointed by the remastered version. Several of my favorite spots have been replaced by soulless CG versions, which seem jarring when interposed between cell animation sequences. I prefer the original voice-acting work as well. At some point, I just stopped watching, when it was clear it couldn't offer anything close to the experience of watching the original. At least the original version is included on the disc.Buy the disc if you want an HD copy of the original GitS (though i can't really tell the difference from the DVD, upscaled on the PS3... perhapss that's all it is?). The remastered version definitely has a cleaner, slightly more fluid look (higher framerate?), but if you already have GitS, I wouldn't bother with this one."
3,on Blu-Ray version,"Since this movie is so popular and believed to be a kind of legend and there's a lot of review on it, I'm not going to comment on movie itself. I'd say it's not much worth buying blu-ray version if you have DVD one (hopefully with upconverter). AQ seems better but I don't see any big difference in PQ between two formats."
3,While Some New CGI Was Decent Didn't Feel Needed,"While it was nice to see that they remastered the video quality somewhat the new CGI effects that were added in seemed an unnecessary attempt, overall for the price I'd say go ahead and get this newer release but don't expect to feel wowed or astonished by anything with this updated releases other then a video quality upgrade."
3,Half-Assed Product.,"The new version, ""2.0"" looks great but if you want to watch the original, it's not even remastered at all. It's just an upscale of the DVD version."
4,An Orton-version,"The original animated scenes were given an Orton treatment. For those who are not familiar with the Orton effect, here is a synopsis - a blurred (out-of-focus) version of the image is blended with the original image giving it a smeared-color look. It is a matter of taste if this is an improvement."
1,won't play on Panasonic DMP-BD35,"Ghost in the Shell 2.0 (blu ray) won't play on my Panasonic DMP-BD35 blu ray player (profile 2.0). It freezes at 00:04 into the movie, and then the player has to be power-reset. It also freezes if I go through scene selection and choose to start on a later scene. There is no problem with any of the special features, and the player has no problems with any of my other ~20 blu ray discs.I exchanged one copy of this disc, thinking it was defective. Amazon sent me a replacement, and it's defective in exactly the same way."
1,What did they do to a beautiful anime?,"I stumbled across this release while looking through some VoD listings. Why did they have to go and butcher GiTS by adding in CGI? Horrible....Just from watching the preview I just had to shake my head in disgust for what they did. One star for what they did to it, wanted to leave it unrated but couldn'tWatch the original release skip this one."
3,Deserves Better Treatments,"For such a classic anime to be upgraded in a less than stellar way is quite sad, I say this in comparison to the Evangelion series of upgrades which are flawless."
3,dissapointed,"thought there might be some extra features on the DVD, but this is just a bare bones good copy of a great anime movie....watch it with surround sound, the music is awesome!"
2,2.0 looks good -- 1.0 transfer looks awful!,"I picked this up assuming that both 2.0 and 1.0 transfers would be of equal quality -- such was not the case. While 2.0 looks great -- that is, if you can put up with pretty dated-looking CG -- 1.0 looks like it's a direct transfer from the original 480p DVD master and looks pretty awful. Buyer beware on this one."
1,Horrible release of a wonderful movie,"Let's get one thing clear: I love Ghost in the Shell. I have everything ever released on DVD. As far as Cyberpunk goes, this is it. Plain and simple.Let's talk about what's wrong with GITS: 2.0They took the 2008 Japanese Bluray and ran a blur filter over it. Want your DVD to look the same? Turn the sharpness down to about 20%. Ta-da!Added in new 3d animation that looks like something from a Playstation One or 2 at best. Low rez, crap quality that has artifacting and residue. We're talking Youtube video quality. I'm not impressed. Going from one type of animation type to another in mid movie is really painful.On top of all that, deciding to change entire color pallets, substituting Amber for Green. Ya that's great. Thanks.This is worse than what Lucas did to Star Wars. Far worse.It's crap.I am very disappointed."
1,Not worth it,I decided to try this product based on a tv recommendation and was disappointed. The ingredients are not organic and I just didn't want to take concentrated pesticides along with my anti-oxidants. I like the Health 4 Wealth ([...]) products much better-they make me feel better the day I take them and have very high quality ingredients in them.
3,Little too basic,"This book is almost too basic, even for the most green horse just learning. Has some good exercises, but wish it was just a little more advanced and had a few more exercise patterns."
2,Definetly for beginners,"I think it's ok, but it only shows you things that you couldve already thoughtve yourself.. like doing figure eights posting!? and some of the suggestons are like.. ""have someone video tape you"".. whatever"
1,Of minimal value,"This book is of minimal value to anyone interested in riding. One of the ""exercises"" is halting correctly, however important, i was expecting more thought put into this book."
1,False Advertisement,"Do not purchase this item. The photo shows a net type of material but in reality all you will receive is a nylon stocking that does not even hold its shape. To be honest, it looks like one of those nylon socks they provide at shoe stores for when you try on shoes. Although it was only $1.99 they charge $5.14 for shipping when this item weighs no more than a post card. I will never buy from this seller EVER again nor do I recommend anyone buy from them either."
1,Wig Cap,This nylon wig cap was not of the quality material I thought it was going to be. I was able to use it only once. It was like buying a cheap pair of knee hi nylons that rip shortly after they are on. I would not recomment this product to anyone. It barely held my daughters hair in it! If there is a tighter spandex or nylon one I would spend the extra money to buy one that lasts for longer than one use. Shop for a better model.
2,Not so great,The cap wont stay on. It keeps sliding up off my head. It was easier just using a cut up stocking than this cap.
2,"Fine Shipping, Mediocre Product","The company is fine, and shipping was fast enough, but the product was mediocre at best. I would've been better off using one of my own stockings."
3,Works,Works well for a wig.Agree with other comments the product held my hair.First I was a little worry but I've use it a few days and still working fine.
1,DOn't buy from this vendor!,"I purchased from this vendor. First the cap was crap and second, I ordered 2 and they only sent me 1."
5,Excellent! A must read for anyone interested in Esoteric,"About two years ago I got very intrigued in the subject ofEsoteric and understanding one's self. A friend showed me the book(in German), and when I asked to borrow it he responded: ""No, this is a book you BUY when you are ready for it!"" I went and got it (in German), and it was the RIGHT time in my life; it did teach me a lot and gave me new perspectives on life and beyond!. This is an excellent book written for the most part in such a language, which we all can understand. It gives a wide verity of options and does not ""push"" you in one specific direction. Thanks to the Amazon setup, I finally found out there is (was) an English publication. I really hope, that in the near future it will be re-printed, I will recommend it to others. It is a must for anybody who is ready for it, and wants to delve deeper into the mysteries of Esoteric. Good Luck and Be Well!"
1,waste of money and very disappointing,"The first one didn't work when we took it out of the box. We exchanged it and the second one works, but the paint barely trickles out. I guess I was expecting more of a spray or at least continuous flow but it is more of a dribble. I will not buy another one."
1,Just doesn't work.,"We just opened ours yesterday. Paint will come out of only one side. THe side that does works just trickles/dribbles out, not a steady stream like the package depicts."
3,Okay--not as good as we thought,"Good things: fun for the kids, worked correctly, easy to use & clean.Bad things: too expensive, paint runs out too quickly, colors not as bright as seen on tv"
1,Buyer beware,"My son received the Crayola Sidewalk Paint Sprayer as a gift. It was easy enough to assemble and it was fun and entertaining but it only lasted for 30 minutes at most. He was very disappointed that it ran out so quickly.The biggest thing to beware of with the Crayola Sidewalk Paint is that it DOES NOT wash off the sidewalk or driveway easily. (Side note: I washed his clothes right away and the paint did come out of them) A month has passed since my son used the sidewalk paint - a month of spraying the paint with a hose and frequent rains yet it still will not wash off. I love my sons creativity but I don't need to have bright pink and blue staining my sidewalk & driveway. I think we will need to rent a pressure washer to remove the paint. Stick with sidewalk chalk - it is economical, fun, lasts longer, and washes off easily."
1,Does not work,The motor was running but no paint was coming out. My poor kid was really let down. This was a birthday gift my son had waited weeks for. I think we'll just exchange it for something else.I don't recommend it.
1,"Don't Buy This, It Doesn't Work",The paint just barely drips out SOMETIMES. The picture on the box shows a boy with the paint streaming out of the toy as he paints creativly on the driveway or sidewalk. It's total hooey! It doesn't work. Don't buy it.
1,garbage,We are trying to understand why ANYONE let alone Crayola would bother to make something that just doesn't work. FOR CHILDREN no less. My son got this as a birthday gift and is in tears...pathetically sitting on the sidewalk with this crappy paint barely dribbling out of the end of this sorry excuse for a toy. Unbelievable. It's not worth the space it's going to take up in my garbage bag.
2,"Seems fun, but......","My daughter seems to have fun with this toy, but the paint gets used way too fast and we can't find refills anywhere!"
1,Not worth the money,"This toy is great in concept, but not in execution. After each of my two children had one decent turn, the paint that came with it was gone and the sprayer was clogged and wouldn't clean properly. We won't be buying the $8 refills for the $15 toy!"
1,Should be called paint dripper not sprayer,I will no longer automatically trust that products with the Crayola name are of good quality because this one is not worth a dime.
1,Disappointed mom!,"My 5 year old son just got this for his birthday and was so excited. It worked for about three minutes, then it stopped working. There was no dried paint clogging the line, given that it was the first time we'd used it. I added more than the water it called for and shook it very well. We used it as directed and it simply didn't last. Now, the engine runs regardless of whether the trigger's depressed or whether it's aimed up, down or sideways, and the water just dribbles out the end. If you tip it upward, with the batteries aiming toward the ground, water gushes out of the battery compartment. That just can't be good! Needless to say, I'm with the rest of the disappointed parents who will not replace this product or buy it for anyone else."
3,"Good, but not nearly as compelling as How We Die or Live","Sherwin Nuland's first two books are among my favorites. His How We Live is a beautiful tribute to the mysteries of the human body and the promise and limits of medicine. His latest book is a disappointment in that regard. The cases aren't as compelling -- and the first case left me feeling that he had milked a family's ignorance for medicine's unnecessary aggrandizement. He packs a lot into the medical history sections, which can either make them breezy or thin. Overall, it's an interesting book, but start with his earlier works and you'll have a much richer reading experience."
4,"A great read, and a great addition to Nuland's work","Dr. Nuland's way with the English language is as eloquent as the topic of discussion in his newest work.This book is not so much an exploration of ""The Body,"" as it is an exploration of the actual ways Medicine has sought to explore its own discipline.It is a fantastic, but all too short trip into the great minds of Medical thinkers, including Nuland himself, and the ways in which they have accelerated its progress; indeed, it also makes light of the ways, doctors, have stifled it.It is, very much, vintage Nuland -with its prose, and offerings of philosophical insight. But it is not like his other books -he doesn't deal with life and the body as in his other achievements. But, if you like Medical history; if you like knowing about the ways some of our most sacred accomplishments in the field came about, then buy this book."
1,Picture does not show a thousand words,"Once this product came I could not give it as a gift it looked so childish. It was just so small and tiny, should have read the measurements and been more careful when ordering stuff like this from this site. Tried to return it but since there was food in it I could not."
4,finally a gift for a guy,After countless hours of searching for a appropriate gift for a friends husband I fortunately came across this gift basket and it was a nice quality for the price. so I am very satisfied with the product I puchased.
2,Puzzles turn into a dull click fest,"The 10 puzzles here get really old really quick. Most of them are rehashes on the jigsaw puzzle theme or the sliding square puzzle theme. And that's the best of them- on the bad side there are some really irritating click fests like ""lens bender"".As the levels advance the puzzles simply add more pieces rather than becoming more interesting or difficult. Solitare and minesweeper are much better Microsoft products. Get a copy of Uncle Henry's playhouse instead (the puzzles from 11th hour & the 7th guest). Those puzzles reflect a real creative effort."
3,Pandora's Box needs to be more difficult,"I enjoyed the game and the different varieties of puzzles but the difficulty levels did not increase appreciably as the game progresses. I had expected some of levels to be nearly impossible to complete but found almost all of the levels to be of easy to medium difficulty. It would have been nice if the more advanced levels were harder to complete.Also, the way the games are constructed, there is no option for infinite variability. In other words, the pieces or puzzles are not reshuffled each time you reach the end. Each time you play it gets easier through the learning curve. This was a true disappointment.I am still looking forward to add on modules, or additional images or pandoras box II"
3,"Challenges your brain, but not very fun to play","This game started out very compelling, but after a while the puzzles got very boring and repetitive. When my wife asked me if I was having fun, I had to answer, ""no, not really."" The graphics are beautiful of course, but the gameplay feels more like work than play. I prefer a game that lets me have fun at the same time I challenge my mind, like Dweep (dweep.com)."
5,Just as Shown,"Great game. This nolonger available from Microsoft, and I had the trial version. When I tried to order it was not available. Thanks again."
4,Puzzling!,"At first I was slightly annoyed that all the puzzles were purely graphic-- I was hoping that there would be brain teasers and logic games and such as well. But the puzzles are gorgeous, addictive, and incredibly calming. Whenever I get stressed out, I like to play this game. A few puzzle types got a little redundant, but overall it's a pretty addictive program."
4,Beware! Addiction level:High!,"This game had great graphics, effects and sound for a puzzle game! The puzzles were pretty interesting, and fun to do, though in the higher stages, I felt that luck had a lot more to do with winning than thinking about it, but hey it's a game. A great way to pass the time!"
4,Makes you think,Good arrangement of puzzles made to get the brain working. Gets addicting after a while. All around fun and challenging.
5,Addictive,I bought this game because of other positive reviews and I am so glad I did. It's an excellent game if you like to be challenged. Time flies and it's refreshing not to be shooting at someone. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes to put their brain to the test.
4,"Finally, I found a game where I didn't have to kill aliens!","If, like me, you have been looking for a game that didn't involve blood-letting, beheading, or slicing/dicing aliens, Pandora's Box will help you pass the time and exercise your left brain's three dimensional capacity by solving (by re-arranging) the puzzle's pieces. Some puzzles take 20 minutes or more to solve. Beautiful lay-out and nice audio too. You have the option of playing their game or just solving puzzles staight-up. It provides hours of mental fun. There are several levels of play---my ten year old enjoys it also."
2,I was sick of this after a few hours,"Looks like a great game, doesn't it? Hundreds of puzzles! Don't let it fool you. All the puzzles involve composing images (some three-dimensional). Most are about as fun as a sliding puzzle. I can't believe this is the best they could come up with. There really are only about 12 puzzle TYPES. The hundreds of puzzles means basically that they have hundreds of images you can play slider puzzle on. It was fun for a few hours, but many of the puzzles are tedious after a while, and when I realized I'd played all the puzzle types, I didn't want to continue.The puzzles aren't even particularly intellectual, either. Most of them involve matching, like a jigsaw puzzle. How long can that keep someone interested? There's no planning (ala lemmings), there's no figuring out how things work, there's no creativity for you. The images you form are sometimes pretty, but they pale in comparison to the lush interactive environments we are used to from the likes of Riven."
2,IT DIDN'T WORK ON MY COMPUTER.,I sent it back because it was the wrong version.I didn't know that there were different versionsuntil I bought this one.
2,Old Games are still Great,"I would like to thank you for helping me find this product, my husband purchased it for me a long time ago and the disk got dammaged, so i went looking for another at a decent price. This is the best I found and wish to thank you for your help in the matter, the post office lost it, it seems and came a little damaged but the container and disk are in good shape."
4,"A Reader from Charlotte, NC",A seemingly true account of life in the middle of the 20th century that anyone can relate to even if you are not an immigrant. The story is told in a rather ingenious way with the help of a young girl's journal. A truly warm and wonderful story that will touch your heart! Really impressive for a first time author!
4,"""A Window Opens""",I found myself anxious to continue reading this book every time I put it down..... The story was well researched and the pace moves along nicely..... Very well done!
3,speak,A real tear jerker. Went through a box of tissues.If you are looking for a movie that will touch your heart this is it.Fantastic performance from Kristen Stewart considering her young age.Loved it.
2,"Why, oh why...","did they have to change the storyline so much? I teach this novel and would have liked a film that was similar. Heck, the setting isn't even the same. Ms. Anderson, how could you have let that happen-being from Syracuse as well, I looked forward to seeing our great city on the big screen.Also, there is a critical scene in the book that is not even mentioned in the movie (the pinning of the frog). This scene is a wonderfully written parallel to what happened to Melinda. It does not make the movie.I will, however, use this film in my class anyway. Why? Because I think it can be a great tool to show students how people perceive characters and stories."
2,usual book-movie comparision,"This movie was good, if you've never read the book, the book is so much better so if you are thinking of buying/seeing this movie do it before you read the book, please."
1,FAKE,Was very disappointed in this product. I could have gone to Wal-mart and bought it for the same price. It is a pirated copy that was made in Mexico and all it had on it was some previews for some different movie. Be careful when you purchase movies from here.
3,Speak DVD,I read the book for this DVD and I wanted to watch the DVD to do a comparison betweeen the two. I thought the book was better. There were parts of the book that I thought they should have added in the movie. never the less I did get a kick out of watching Kristen Stewart before she was Bella.Marlene
4,Good for Comparison,"I bought this DVD to show to my students after they read the novel. It is fairly close to the book, but different enough that the students questions directorial choices. For that reason it is useful. It doesn't have the humor of the book."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A well-acted teen drama starring a pre-fame Kristen Stewart and an enjoyable Steve Zahn, Speak doesn't really say much (sorry for the pun) but it's much smarter than most films pitched at teens and is worth watching."
4,Nice,"I hadn't seen the movie, but I am a teacher. I wanted to get it to go along with reading the book."
5,awesome,"excellent condition,not one complaint about the movie and i have watched it a few times already as well as other family members"
5,Love the movie as much as the book !,This film is so wonderful and made me cry Kristen Stewart is my favorite actress and I love her work in this movie :)
5,awsome movie,I would recomend reading the book first as the book is always better than the movie. however it was emotionaly charged and touching. Kristin stewart did a great job with this movie!
4,Not As Good As Book,"I bought the movie because I'm such a big fan of the book. Laurie Halse Anderson's book, Speak, was AWESOME. Very powerful writing. And something young girls really do experience; and don't tell. The movie was pretty good. The book is much better."
5,Nice film--thoughtful and articulate,"I enjoyed this movie a great deal--the acting and direction were very good, and the story was realistic and it held me very strongly. I appreciated the fact that they didn't allow the main character to digress to victimhood; instead, it's a very gripping tale of a girl who simply takes some time to come to grips with something awful that happened to her. In a culture in which we all want to ""cure"" people as soon as we can when they go through trauma, it's nice to see a story which shows respect for the need to take some time to deal with feelings of betrayal, helplessness, confusion, frustration, and anger (among many others, I'm sure). Personally, I didn't like the next-to-last scene in her sanctuary, but it still works whether I like it or not."
2,"Nice aluminum, but not very usable.","I ordered this to protect my iPod, but with the iPod in this case, I can't plug in my external speakers because the hole for the speaker jack isn't big enough. If you're just going to use your apple ear buds, then there is no problem, but other ear phones or external speakers will likely have a problem fitting through the hole in the case. Also, order the black case as the silver one is very very cheesy looking. Also, there is no screen protector included with this protective case."
3,schleich dragon,I don't like how the wings seem to be made out of a different material. They tried to make them look transparent but i think they just don;t fit
4,"Stylish, looks like real leather, and rugged","This hardy Bible cover is large enough for the Thomas Nelson King James Study Bible ISBN: 0785201688 and most other Extra large Bibles. It still manages to zip up (although the zipper tab tends to be tucked under the largest Bible), and has a handy outer pocket for postcards and bulletins, two pen holders."
5,1001 And Uses,"Elmers -- Good American Company.Foam Board -- Good Material Component.Mounting Something? Building Something? Reinforcing a light-weight object?Seriously this stuff will amaze you. Easy to cut, shape, bend and comes in big cases.Models, boxes, ramps, whatever!"
1,Disappointed,"Was very excited to show my son, but when I opened package it was bent. Very disappointing ! Very cute , but they should really make it sturdier! If it does Not even hold up in shipping!"
3,It's fine,"My two year old is not quite ready for it, but he still likes to look in it and say there are ""stars"" in it. And he loves Curious George, so that helps!"
2,Not the way Sudoku should be,"I was very disappointed when I received this. The quality is excellent, BUT it is for 3 or more players. Most other Sudoku games I have seen are for 1 or more players. I doubt this game will get much use because it will be very rare that three or more ""Sudoku players"" will be around with time to spare for a game. This game is not good unless you have a family--or a group of friends--in which all members play and enjoy Sudoku.This is not the choice to make if you have found you enjoy Sudoku as a hobby and you want to play with it more, UNLESS you are part of a group that loves Sudoku! I wish I had known that three players are needed beforehand; I would have made a different and better choice."
1,how do you play,"If there had been instructions in the box when I got the game it may have been helpful. Just the board, tiles and die I don""t really know how to make up my own rules. The game was still in the celephane so nobody had taken the rules out."
4,"Great solution, but with a limited lifetime","I bought my speck skin in May of 2005. It has worked like a champ since then. The screen cover does get a little scratched as time goes on, but it never bothered me so much. Probably the biggest issue is that once you've taken your Treo out of the skin and put it back in a few times (say, 5 or 6) the skin starts to get ""stretched out"" and doesn't fit as snugly as when it was new. I hardly ever take my phone out of the skin, but the few times you do (memory card, hard resets, etc) will cause issues down the road.All that said, the plastic clip that holds the phone in the holster broke yesterday and I'm ordering a new one to replace it. As I see it, I got nearly a good, solid year of use out of it and I don't mind buying a new one. It's a great product with a few deficiencies."
1,Not worth it,The holster gets dirty extremely fast -- it picks up dust like a Swifter. Don't waste your money.
4,"Protects well, no memory slot access","The Speck SkinTight w/holster protects my Treo 650 well.The holster looks flimsy but has been very durable. The clamp does not hold on well to thick belts, however.My biggest criticism of this product is that there is no opening for the memory card slot: One has to take the Treo out of the SkinTight in order to access it."
4,Nice addition to my garage,"This garage stool is very nice. its basically your typical garage stool and nothing more. I became a fan of busted knuckle because it suits me perfectly. The only withdrawl is, if you sit on the stool for a long time it tends to hurt your booty and back. But other than that, its gotta alot of compliments."
2,1 leg short,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. After reading reviews for garage stools I settled for this one, being that it had really good reviews. Well, after giving it to him, he put it together and 1 of the legs is shorter than the other 3. Which makes for a wobbly stool. Being that it is 1/2"" - 1"" shorter I was not happy at all. After putting it together he didn't want to hassle with it to send it back, so now he has a wobbly, unstable stool."
4,tonetoke,"This Stool is worth the price. Mine is in my opium den and use it playing guitar, its a nice height and so far sturdy. Its pretty much as stated in the description. A few things to know; for the larger person (6'5, 300) it's comfortable for about 45 min; the cushion has a little padding but ring the cushion there is something hard holding it together, this can become a little uncomfortable and it is slightly uneven I was make adjust by playing with the tightness of the screws and assembly it is time consuming. Nevertheless everyone that has used it was fine with it. It's about 150 maybe 200 extra dollars to resolve the things to know points.I would suggest this to a friend."
3,Readable but disappointing,"I am surprised at the number of 4/5 stars. Maybe this is due to the guru status Quinn has obtained?I have read all of Quinn's books and enjoyed them but this book doesn't seem to have the eloquence and craftsmanship that Ishmael and ""B"" had. I too finished this book in a very short time but was left flat. No ""a-ha"" moments, no ""wows"", no deep insights. Maybe I'll read it again and see if I missed something or, better yet, reread the Story of B."
3,Not on par with Story of B or Ishmael,"After Dachau serves to illustrate Daniel Quinn's argument that history is socially constructed (which is a backbone of his argument about how we think about ""totalitarian agriculture"" and modern society). It accomplishes this by setting itself in a fictional society in which Germany won World War II and nobody thinks of the Holocaust as a Holocaust. It's not bad, but Quinn still has a lot of trouble writing realistic dialogue--the dialogue isn't as stilted as it was in Ishmael or My Ishmael, but the ideas are much less provocative and new. And he resorts to a cliched ""boy-and-girl lead characters fall in love"" plot. I enjoyed the book but it's not on par with his other works."
2,"Padded, I fear","This book was over 200 pages (in large type) but was actually completely covered in Quinn's earlier book ""Story of B"" in which a character posed the question ""what if everything we've been told is a lie?"" I won't reveal any more than that, but I don't need to. ""Story of B"" and ""Ishmael"" are excellent books, but this one is really a 2-page idea (at that) drawn out a hundredfold. I don't think it adds anything to Quinn's previous work. If you skip it, you will not have missed anything at all if you've read his first three books."
2,A sloppy and lazy story,"I give this book two stars rather than one based solely on the potential of the ideas at its core. Which is exactly why the book is so disappointing-- what a rich opportunity for a story, and what a lazy, uninspiring, pointless execution. Some of the worst dialogue I've ever read. You get the feeling that the author has become a little too enthralled with himself, and assumes that his readers will be on board no matter what he chooses to feed them. To say that the book is on par with 1984 and Brave New World is nonsense."
5,Quinn does it again!,"I don't know how he does it, but he's done it again; another thought-provoking, chilling, absorbing book by Daniel Quinn that left me reeling. Right up there with the works of Orwell, Bradbury, and Huxley--After Dachau is a brilliant look at a world gone worse. A beautifully written, gripping, and compelling story. Read this book!"
3,"Good, but could have been much better.","I felt the book was very rushed. It's rather short and I read it in one sitting in just a few hours. I really wanted deeper character and plot development and more details on Jason ""finding out who he is"" and Mallory/Gloria's transition into her new self and world. So many things seem to be lacking or brushed over, it almost feels like an hour tv-show instead of a enthralling novel. I was just getting into it when it ended. :-/Don't get me wrong though, I think Quinn is an incredible writer and I enjoyed reading this book. I've read the Ishmael books and Story of B and there are very few books that have moved me like they did. But After Dachau is certainly not the same caliber material as his previous work, but I applaud Quinn for exploring."
4,"Pretty good British romantic drama, a bit on the tragic side.","If you like British historical dramas and melodramas, you will definitely like this one."
1,hated it,"This movie was just about two people who hardly knew eachothers' names and ended up sleeping together. It's only romantic because they were from opposite sides of the road. The acting was good, but I also would reccommend watching them in something other than this. Besides, how many pacmen did she have up there?"
2,Should be rated X,I was pretty shocked at the explicit sex scenes in this movie. It is NOT the Romeo and Juliet story they portray on the back cover. We never saw those two in their birthday suits! Romeo had much more integrity than the guy in this movie. This guy is a very self centered young man and she is a fool. They end up in the hay pretty fast and continue to go at it with out any getting to know each other. Not that rollicking in the hay before marriage is good anytime.I was pretty diappointed.
4,Leaves Romeo and Juliet in the shadows,"As a Jew I can vouch for the detailed and correct depiction of a Jewish Family in the beginning of the twentyfirst century.Wonderful research!!!The story is so beautiful and timeless,that i had to watch it over and over.However I think the ending is so incredibly horrid that it might haunt the viewer for a long time."
3,"Good acting, but disappointing film","This film was wonderfully acted, beautifully filmed, and certainly held my interest, but the predictability was also there. You knew that at least ONE of the leads would die in the other's arms and that the film would end depressingly. I also agree with the reviewer who did not buy the love story: it is true that these two young people seemed more like animals in heat than really in love, and I thought that the character of Solomon was dishonest from the beginning. He also abandoned Gaenor pretty quickly at first. I didn't really understand why he suddenly had to find her: was it love or that the big city life in Cardiff wasn't too fun for him? I would have rated the film higher if the love story had been more convincing and I hadn't found Solomon too be so weak and misleading. The prize of the film was the actress who played Gaenor. She was exceptional, and I loved hearing all of the Welsh spoken throughout."
3,Could Be Better,"As a Hornblower fan for some time, I was curious to see how Ioan Gruffudd would do in other works so I bought this film. While his acting is commendable as Solomon, it's a shame the movie wasn't better. As hard as he tried, his performance was hampered by a tired plot and predictable writing. It is hard to feel anything regarding the Soloman and Gaenor relationship because it seems based entirely on sex. There needs to be ""moments"" where we see the true love between them. If they were there, I missed it. Because they weren't there, I could feel no sympathy to their delimma. Kudos to the actors protraying the two families. Unfortunately they were more three-dimensional than the two leads, and were the only reason I kept watching this film after the halfway point. Thumbs up for the performances of the actors who portrayed Gaenor's brother and Solomon's mother.If you're a Gruffudd fan, you'll get this movie no matter what. If you're a movie fan, rent before you decide to buy."
4,Home World Review useing Windows 7 Ultra 32 Bit,"Following instructions it installed and runs,able to play on my Windows 7 Ultra 32 Bit system.Installed and runs real good on my computers system.The quality of the game is excellent and the syfy story line that takes place in the future is very good also,I find it interesting,I like this game.I think its worth the money."
3,"Ok, but too slow","When I first got this game I thought it was perfect, but once I got to many ships, I couldn't move my mouse at all. Anyway I thought it had pretty good graphics as long as it didn't freeze. I suggest this software to anyone who has a very fast computer."
2,Frustrated quick w/this one,I bought it after all the great reviews and game of the year award...I was disappointed and got frustrated managing the views. I also had a hard time getting it to be compatible w/my sound card. Sierra's support helped me but only after several days via email.
2,Good but not Great,"This game is beautiful and very intruiging at first. The interface is consice and the story starts off good. About the 4th mission I started to give up. All the missions are scripted. The AI usually won't do anything until it is triggered which gives you plenty of time to get an army, or not, together. Usually I would spend all my money and still not have a big enough fleet to complete even the 4th mission. Your ships, money, and resources carry over from one mission to the next so be careful. Bad management could leave the game unfinishable."
5,Ender Wiggen eat your heart out!,"The best computer game, EVER. true 3D fleet combat in a gorgeous anime-inspired universe. I have been playing it daily for almost a year now. Everthing about this game is perfect, the music is haunting, the background and feel are epic and mature. Truly a masterpeice!"
2,Not hooked,"If a game doesn't hook me within the first half-hour then I'm just not going to see it through to the end. Homeworld just seemed like Age of Empires: In Space to me and the slow, confusing gameplay really got on my nerves. I know that this game has an Army of fans who will denounce my comments, but I simply could not get into it.Usually, I like space games and I was hoping that this would have a Star Trek-ish feel to it. I also quite the Wing Commander games and since it only cost me 99p then I thought I might as well give it a go. Call me shallow, but it didn't give me instant satisfaction and uninstalled it after only 45 minutes."
5,Incomparable: Flawless,"This game certifiably kicks ass. I am completely in awe of the beauty of the storyline, graphics, and espcially the music. Whoever thought of mixing Islamic music with sci-fi is brilliant; the solem and almost sad beauty of this game cannot be overemphasized. It's just beautiful; that's the best word to describe it. This game draws you in; the adrenaline rush I got from meeting an alien race in the depth of uncharted space was incredible."
3,Attractive but too revealing,"I really like wearing this short for my personal practice, but find the bulge too revealing to teach in, and I'm a little embarrassed to even wear them to classes where I'm a student. Also, they get a little too baggy and saggy after one class, which is fine for a personal practice, but if you teach for a few hours, the short really loses it's initial fit and look. I like the color choices and wish more shorts were available in these colors."
5,"a good, good book...","I strongly disagree with the previous reader. This book was an easy read, one of the books I've read from cover to cover. I've had some difficulty finding an introductory book on .net object oriented methodologies, and fortunately I found this gem. Nevermind those small typos,the main thing is you get to learn and dig how classes and objects work in VB. If you have background in Java like me, this will be a breeze, but nevertheless, Alistair has that teaching method that will make you really interested on the topic and you will read more and more until you finish this great book. Highly recommended to all beginners in vb.net oop!"
3,"maybe not the best one in the series, but still a real laugh","Full of laughs, Police Academy 5 is one to watch .As usual , Harris is up to no good and Lassard is causing problems, and the group, Hooks, Hightower, Jones, Tackleberry e.t.c are there to save the day. Watch it !"
5,Flipping for Charmaine,"I have been hearing Charmaine Clamor on the radio for some time now and always associated her with jazz standards, such as the ones she did on this album, ""Searching for the Soul."" There's some of that on her new album ""Flippin' Out"" -- check out her exceptionally sultry version of ""Hadn't Anyone Until You."" But now Clamor is giving us songs of her native culture, and you can hear in her beautiful voice a profound connection with the material. The lullaby she sings, for example, is a wonderfully healing performance. And what she does with ""Be My Love"" is something like genius. I've completely ""flipped"" for Charmaine. She's a major artist just coming into her own. Be sure to check out ""Flippin' Out"" if you dig this album!"
5,Soulful!,"This is the recording that got the legend started. If you didn't know this was Charmaine Clamor's first CD, you might think from the confident and soulful singing that it was her greatest hits. Some of the songs are very sensual, even sexy, which is a quality that has carried on in her subsequent work. When I hear ""Flippin' Out,"" it reminds me of some of her earlier creations on this debut CD, which have the same sort of classy yet ""dirty"" energy. She sings ""I'm in the Mood for Love"" on this great CD, and I can tell you that it ALWAYS puts me in the right frame of mind. Do yourself a favor: Get this CD in your collection (along with some candles and a bottle of red wine), and then see her live!"
2,New 30-minute radio mysteries --but almost charmless,"This is a Canadian revival of the old 30-minute radio mystery show format: A protagonist cab-driver we come to know, the owner of the cab company, the dispatcher, and then their odd encounters with cab customers. But it's almost charmless (except for the Canadian accents, which are pleasant). The characters have idiosyncracies, but they're not interesting. The plots are either downright dumb (as in title story) or so quickly sketched that it's sort of just starting by the time it's solved. It's nonviolent, inoffensive, and it passes the time, but just that."
4,I couldn't put it down,"Beam me up Scotty is a greaaaaaaaat book. He is kind of like Bukowski, but with a Saturday Night Live sense of humor."
2,bukowski it ain't,"I never really sunk my teeth into this book- it never ultimately delivered the promised descent into the addicts' hell, which I so perversely anticipated. Any comparison to the beat authors of my generation is an injustice to the the tortured souls who warrant that description."
2,Bukowski it ain't,"The story seemed promising enough at the beginning, but ultimately failed to deliver. Comparisons to the early beat authors are an injustice to those who legitimately deserve that description."
1,a wholly forgettable novel,The book failed to capture the psyche of the addict- was too predictable- lacked substance.
3,"Great videos, not-so-great transfers","I liked the Pointer Sisters' videos (and songs) when they first came out, although I wish this DVD contained the Slow Hand video and maybe performances of a couple of their earlier hits. My main problem with this DVD is the poor quality of the transfers, which are mostly of poor detail, as if a VHS tape or a YouTube video was the source. This isn't so bad on well-lighted scenes, but the darker scenes, such as the sequences on stage in ""Jump,"" rather diminish the experience."
3,Three Stars for her 3 best stories,"Of the 10 shorts in this collection, I tore out 7 and kept these 3 in the binding: In The Gloaming (radiant, tender, loving), Home (piercing, heartfelt, subdued), and Watch The Animals ( aching, poignant, triumphant). Dark's other 7 stories mired in alcohol, foul language, and banality."
1,Leg Rest?,"hello, i was just woundering if anyone can tell me if it has a extendable leg rest for babies? thank you for your help:)"
5,rpnald mcdonld,i hav this movie and i think it is a very betiful film and every kid should watch it. the voice acting is superduper and the amination is nothing less than good. i laughed wehn ronald told jokes and got so scared when the ghosts came out 50 out of 1 stars great film you should by it
4,Good Design!,I've had this type of grapefruit knife before (from Williams-Sonoma) and like the way it works. I took off a star because the double blades used for cutting the membrane between sections seem to have flexed some so that I believe more of the fruit is being left with the membrane than I like.
2,Waste of time.,"I leave two stars because it is what it is.. and I give the inventor some credit for being creative but this grapefruit knife is 100% useless in our grapefruit-loving house.Try it... it's got two thin blades and you need to put on magnifying glasses to align them properly.. that alignment takes far too long. I was able to cut an entire grapefruit with an ordinary knife 80% faster than with this specialty knife.The blades become clogged with pulp, which is nearly impossible to clean from between the blades.A novel idea, but an impractical execution.My Amazon order simultaneously came with two paring knives which I feel were by far the value in my order and the way our home will cut grapefruit. This product is 'fun' for the price but a complete waste of time for us. Not going to use it, ever."
3,Grapefruit knife,"It's good, but to all that. I do just a well or better with a thin serrated blade steak knife and a grapefruit spoon. And the thing is a pain to clean and dangerous in a drawer."
1,ummm.....wallpaper music,"not sure what this volume 4 is trying to achieve, but me thinks that if you take all 4 volumes and actually pick through the songs you might salvage one decent record...ughhhhh listen at your own risk!"
2,not what I was hoping for...,"Overall, not soothing nor rhythmic: too many tracks carrying harsh overtones and those were the longest tracks...sent it to a friend...hope she enjoys it!"
4,a MAJOR event in the Spidey mythos,"The writing is good and the art is solid, but what makes this a must own is it's long lasting impact on Spider-man history. This is one of the defining moments of Spider-man mythology. Anyone looking to know the character should really read this as it is essential."
5,Dead Like Me,"Clearly the Best original show of last year. The director borrowed heavily from Piers Anthony series The Incarnation of Immortality. This is a 7 book set. Read the first book too""On a Pale Horse"".Anyway, clearly well written and well acted.Kudos"
5,"Fun, Fresh and Full of Laughs","I had seen a few episodes here and there on the movie network and was instantly hooked. Once getting the DVD set, the show made so much more sense to watch in order and see how George's life evolved from living.This is a definite must have for those interested in witty sarcasms and don't want to take life to seriously. Too many shows these days leave you feeling empty and depressed as the credits roll - not here.Once in awhile, it's nice to laugh about something that's usually serious and depressing. It gives a true meaning to live life to it's fullest.I'm currently watching Season 2 and it gets even better! Trust me, you won't be disappointed! A lot more substance and character developement ensues. :)"
2,"Wonderfull show, crap DVD set...","Nothing to say about the show, it rocks !!!!But i always wonder why those DVD set never contain any Subtitles. May be useless for you, but when you're deaf... It's a shame..."
1,Bad TV at its Best!,"Thank goodness this show was cancelled. This is one terrible show, full of bad language, blasphemy as well as a repetitive storyline. The main character cant get beyond the point that she is dead and episode after episode you have to look at bad acting. Is it a funny show? If only, I didnt even give a grin at the stupid jokes. This is one series you can definitely do without"
5,Dead Like Me - First Season),"Dead Like Me was one of the finest TV productions ever offered, and most viewers didn't watch it. The creators and writers had a rare epiphany and translated it into a perfectly charming TV product. Sadly, the American six-pack and chicken wings viewing public prefers their TV fare packaged and served in the form of easy-to-digest, low nutrition items. As a result, Dead Like Me lived for only two seasons and was cancelled -- a deserving fate for Jerry Springer and Fear Factor, but these pieces of garbage are served with chips and dip."
4,3.5 Really...,"I like snarky, dark comedy and Dead Like Me delivers it in great quantities. The writing is fantastic and the characterization is superb, the acting start out okay but eventually gets better, especially as Ellen Muth seems to hit her comfort zone in the series.My only real problem with this series or, at least, this season of this series is the fact that they rehash clips from previous shows entirely too often. One episode is 95% clips from previous shows and most other episodes are at least 15%. If I'm investing my time and money in a show, I'm expecting new material in each show, not a reheated mix-match of previous ones."
5,Dead Like Me - Season One,"This series rocks! Its a well written dark comedy with a touching moment here and there. Showtime really dropped the ball by not renewing this series for a third season. Fortunately, the DVDs are still available. I highly recommend for all over 16 yrs old.(language)"
5,Happy Time,"If You Like Comedy And Very Weird People, You'll Like This Series. The First Time I Saw This Series, I Was Like, Wow, Man. If I Told You What Happened To George, She Is The Main Character, That Would Just Give Away The Whole Gig. I Think You Should Pick Up This Series And Smoke Some Cigars And Prepare For A Happy Time. :)"
5,When are they going to release the second season on dvd?,"I thought the first season was very compelling and since I don't have showtime, I had to buy the first season on dvd. It was great - one of the best series ever on tv right up there with all the great shows in cable series format. For example: Nikita even though DLM it wasn't all action all the time, in it's own way it was just as good as any other hit cable show. So where's the second season my money is in my hand ready to buy? You too, should want this impressive cable series the second season of this fantastic and highly entertaining 'Dead Like Me'!"
1,"Listen to the negative reviews, don't believe the hype...","Ditto the negative responses for cliches, wooden dialogue, etc.. I was only able to spend 20 minutes with this snoozer of a show. Showtime let this show die for a good reason. Try six feet under instead."
5,Quirky and very satisfying television,"This is one of my favorite shows of the past few years. In fact, I don't think I have been this satisfied with watching a new show in the past few years! The show is well written, original (ok death is a common theme on a few new shows, but they don't do it like this!), and the supporting cast is fantastic!!! I keep thinking that this character or that character is a favorite, but then remember other aspects of another character I like too. Even the smaller characters like Crystal, the happy time receptionist, or the waitresses at Der Waffle Hous. Kind of reminds me somewhat of the show Northern Exposure, but with a black twist. I haven't seen the DVD, just have watched the show, but I can recomend this show to anyone, and I have!"
4,Well done,Mandy Patinkin is a national treasure. This show was completely different from anything else ever. Thought provoking and funny. Each character was full.
4,An Original Storyline....AT LAST!,"Dead Like Me is the most original television series to come along in a very long time. As far as I can think back, it is the only show to deal with grim reapers.The program offers a rollercoaster of emotions. In a single episode you can laugh and in a matter of moments your eyes will well up and feel a tear escape and run down a cheek. This is the true test of an excellent show.My only complaint with the show is there are some episodes that the amount of obscene language does get rather tiresome, especially the ""F"" word."
3,Is this a new episode...,"I've enjoyed all the episodes up to this point. However, this episode has to be more rerun of the season thus far than a ""new"" episode. It was kind of hard for me to watch because of the redundancy. Then again I have watched it all in just a few sittings. :)"
3,such potential wasted,"This show started out so great, with a premise that somewhat odd and unbelievable ended up working, mostly. The problem I have with this show is that it has too many leads into plot conflicts that are never resolved, especially her fathers groping of the guy at her funeral and the subsequent phone calls, etc. I can't wait to catch the second season and hopefully tie up some of these loose plot strings."
3,"Good show, bad language","""Dead Like Me"" features an engaging plot that's primarily troubled with wonderful, well developed characters and delightfully morbid situations. Each part is perfectly cast, it's simply impossible to imagine any other ensemble mastering these roles.Though the series offers a fun viewing experience, the routine abandon in which the actors sling trashy dialog could be an unfortunate turnoff for some. Beneath the abrasive language is an otherwise beautifully written and brilliantly acted show."
3,Not as dark as it pretends to be,"This is a fresh take on an old concept: the afterlife is run by an inept bureaucracy, so when you die, wackiness ensues. You've seen it before in ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Heaven Can Wait"". Which is not to say that ""Dead Like Me"" is a ripoff of those movies -- it does have its own ideas. The most important of these is that the dead souls drafted as ""Reapers"" don't get paid, and have to earn a living (one of many such ironies) in various low-profile, and therefore low-paid jobs. It's amusing, and well-acted, but after a while you sort of wonder why George and her team never really have to deal with really nasty, unpleasant death. Or you just suspend all criticalness, get entertained for an hour, but don't really get anything out of it."
2,Starts out with promise and fails to deliver,"I brought this movie based on the great reviews that it had received.The initial couple of episodes were interesting but as the series progressed, it was repetition without substance.Overall, the series had a cute concept but the writers /directors just didn't take it anywhere and by the end of the first-series, I promised myself that I would not invest in the second-season.At the end of the series, I no longer cared what happened to ""George"". She's going to be doing much the same activites, with most of the same people that were in the first season and I really don't care if they move on or stay where they were."
2,Extremely boring series. Very large let down.,"The pilot episode was decent, and it certainly had great special effects. But I'm afraid that the plot line seemed to limp. The character Roxy was flacid. Rube seemed pretty good as a leader (middle mangagement). Mason has more potential, but sells out.The series drags along, and has no real momentum. The story lines are lousy, and the season finale was dreadfully pitiful. One of the later episodes in the first season is about the gravelings taking a day off, and the grim reapers having to file paperwork for the souls that have been taken over the time.-It seems like they were already running out of bad ideas, so they came up with another poor one. If anyone here agrees with me in the slightest, I advise to check out Nip/Tuck, or Sopranos, or Six Feet Under, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Seinfeld.-Guaranteed not to be disappointed."
5,Such an amazing show!!,"This was such an amazing show, and I really wish it had gone on for more than just two seasons. The cast was great, the stories were great. We need more shows like this!"
5,Absolutely Loved this show,Started watching this show from the beginning on Showtime. Taped it when it ws on SyFi and then bought the DVD when it came out. Never get tired of watching these shows. This was one of the best series I ever saw. The interaction with the characters was the absolute best. Whoever was in charge of the casting did an absolutely marvelous job.
5,Love It!,I saw the commercial for this show quite some time ago and thought it looked really good. I don't get Showtime and I couldn't watch it so I forgot about it. Then while I was in the video store I saw it and remembered it and thought I had to get it. So I rented the first 2 disks and eminently fell in love. This show is addicting! I bought it soon after and watched the rest of the episodes in a little over a week and a half. This show is really funny and just really good! The extras for this set are pretty cool and the packaging is makes for a really cool look as well. I recommend this for everyone who's not uptight about death. Watch It!
3,Dead Like Me - The Complete First Season,"The script is definitely entertaining, but they could have left out the overabundance of obscenities. That all seems much too ""forced"". If you can overlook that, you might enjoy the humor & entertainment a bit more."
4,Quirky and entertaining,"Originally I tuned into DLM because it was summer and there was nothing else on, and in the beginning it was just that: a pretty decent show for the summer. However, as the season progressed I thought that the characters were fleshed out better (you learn more about the supporting cast's past) and there was even a storyline (rather than each episode being independent).Anyways, why four stars? Because it's entertaining, full of dry humor and the characters are human and imperfect...which makes it better then 95% of the shows out there."
4,Good Show,This show was pretty good over all. It did get a little repetitious though. I keep hoping to see some type of resolve to the whole death issue with her family.
3,not as good as i had hoped,"There has been a spat of excellent American TV shows being produced over the past number of years. This show wouldn't be classified as one of them. The premise is good, but its feels quite disjointed. The protagonist is quirky but not engaging enough for anyone to care about what she thinks. and the worst thing is that there isn't any English subtitles."
5,Great Show,I loved this show so I had to buy the seasons. Sucks that they took it off air but I heard its coming back. This set is highly recommended.
1,1 star for MGM not releasing widescreen version.,"This is probably the best show ever made. That being said, I am reviewing this version. The cropped version. This TV show was filmed in 16:9 mode. Why is it in 4:3 here and everywhere else. I guess I won't be watching it."
5,Wow,Total enjoyment. I was unsure about the subject and how it would be addressed in a T.V. show but by the time 3 episodes were watched I was a fan. Watch seasons 1 & 2 then the movie. Wow!
4,Dead Like Me complete season 1,"I first saw Dead Like Me on TV and I didn't like it because of the foul language. A year later I saw it on Youtube and this time I became fascinated with the idea of living dead that reaped souls. I watched both seasons 1 & 2 on Youtube, despite of the bad language, and I finished every single episode TWICE! In fact, I liked it so much this time that I bought the DVD set.The acting is good and plots are interesting. If the language was a bit less offensive I would give this 5 stars.If you are not sure whether or not you want to keep a copy of the show, just go on Youtube to check it out. Took me a while to finally buy my own copy but I definitely have no regret."
1,One hit wonder,"I bought this (from REI, not Amazon) pedometer and was highly impressed the first time I used it. I loved being able to have pre-set radio stations instead of the typical scan feature on most of the FM pedometers. The signal was even pretty good for the radio throughout most of the first use.Then the second time I went to use it, the screen was blank & would not turn on. The batteries were brand new, and I had turned off the radio after the first use, so I the battery should have still had plenty of power left, but it would not work.Buy this at your own risk."
1,"Poorly made, overpriced","Product bought on impulse for $22 at retail store. I would not have paid half that if I could see it for 5 min. Radio sound is mono with poor reception. Headphone plug is not the normal headphone jack size so you cannot plug your own headphones into it easily (you would need an adapter if you could find one). Right out of the box the display was malfunctioning and needs to be jiggled to work right. Battery compartments requires a screwdriver to get in and even the slightest bit of overtightening of the screw will crack the plastic eye that the screw passes through. Both battery compartents are frustratingly awkward to access. Controls are clunky, and the methods for setting things are obtuse. Battery drain on the AA's is absurd, draining fresh batteries in just a matter of hours. Belt clip is flimsy and I fully expect it to break in short order. Overall feel of the product tactilly is cheap. Avoid this product."
5,Possibly one of the most candid and intimate insights of a band in recent times.,Possibly one of the most candid and intimate insights of a band in recent times.Oasis were a band that comes along only every generation and touches millions on the way. This funny and endearing book by their close friend and confidant Tim Abbot captures the rise from early shows in Manchester to early American and Japanese tours. It is rare that access like that is ever given to outside photographers. This batch of photos and video grabs gives the reader an access all areas look at the rise of a music phenomenon.
5,THEY ARE THE BEST BAND EVER! EXCELLENT PICTURES,THE BOOK WAS REALLY GOOD AND SHOWS THAT OASIS ARE REAL PEOLPLE AND THEY ARE GREAT HUMAN BEINGS. OASIS IS THE BEST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED AND THE REST OF THE WORLD SHOULD BE THANKING THEM INSTED OF PUTTING THEM DOWN CAUSE OF A FEW MISTAKES.ROCK ON!!!!!
2,Poorly executed,"To start, I had to be on line w/ Sierra tech support for about an hour before giving up in desperation and sending them an e-mail before this game would work. Sierra tech support is the most evil thing in the universe. But I digress. This game was awkward. The plot seemed weird and random, so that if you did one wrong thing you lost all your stuff and got in near-impossible fights. Also, the graphics were stiff and weird. For example, in combat, if you miss someone, your sword still plunges straight through the enemy. Overall, it lacks stability and quality."
2,Anticlimactic.,"This has to be the most horribly produced game from Sierra I've ever played. The storyboard artists and creators must have been off their rocker. The graphics were pretty, the battles were somewhat exciting, but the delivery fell completely short. The combat and stats were horribly unbalanced, to the point where when I played the game the first time, I found it extremely difficult, and the second time I played it, it was a breeze just because I spent time levelling my characters up. The voice acting was mediocre. The story sounds promising in the beginning, especially with this series' reputation, but it finds itself to be completely anticlimactic in the end. So if you like pretty graphics and good music only in a game, pick this one up perhaps. But I'd rather just throw Lord of the Rings in my DVD player, because this is a sore excuse for a game or a story."
2,The books are better,"Having read the books and enjoyed them thoroughly, I bought the game.At 25 I'm an avid gamer (I've been gaming since games were invented for the 386). I was disappointed. The graphics are ok but the game play is not the greatest. Fight scenes are awkward and there are too many items to use, that are not very useful.There were just too many little things that annoyed me about this game, one of them being that there's no save-anywhere feature, you have to start at the beginning of the chapter.The story is good, but it's like Return to Krondor for Dummies. Stick with reading the books, you'll probably be disappointed with the game."
1,SLLLOOOOOOWWWWW,"I got this game from a freind for free awhile back. The graphics are pritty good but the character movements are EXTREMELY slow. The characters walk all the time. The battles are pritty lame too because all of the movements are slow. In my opinion its not even worth getting for free, which is how I got it."
1,NOT HAPPY,Wish I could write a review on Return to Krondor.But thats not what you sent me. The book Krondor the Betrayal that you sent me is green in color and looks good on my shelf. The video game in the back of the book says it has Return to Krondor and Betrayal at Krondor on it.But it doesn't. You have my money and I have your JUNK.Thank YouJim
3,Technology Blues,"I'm a Feist fan and it seemed like a great idea. However, with Windows XP the game wouldn't install correctly the first time and now Windows cant even run the Windows 95 or earlier start program. I thought it would be fun to play an older game, well so much for that."
3,"Great play, Disappointing Plot","I played Betrayal At Krondor and I played it twice more, just for the plot. It was like reading your favourite book over and over again. But Return to Krondor was disappointing. The graphics and the sound were great, but where is that sense of adventure that was present in Betrayal? RTK is extremely thin on the plot, though the introduction led me to expect more out of the plot, with the mysterious Tear of Ishap etc. And favourite characters like Jimmy the Hand became much like a string puppet, walking only where the game wants you to. I didn't like that. The character upgrades were faster than Betrayal but for an avid fan of the Raymond E. Feist's books on Krondor, it was a great disappointment. It almost felt like the author was withholding much of the plot so that he had something to write in his new book, which left the gamers with little. If the plot was better developed, it would have been a longer game but well worth it."
3,Le Tartuffe Bilingual Edition,"I bought this book for my 17th Century French Theatre class. While it was nice to have the English and French versions side by side for reference, a lot of the English translations were inaccurate. Also, there were no line numbers, which made it difficult when trying to discuss specific sections in class. I found several typographical errors, and in one act the scenes are divided the wrong way. Other than that, it arrived promptly and I was able to make due."
2,"Talented pianist, but far too fast","The songs on this album sounds like the person playing just wanted to show off how fast he/she could play them without regard for how fast they're supposed to be played. If you want to hear a talented pianist playing nearly flawlessly, this is a perfect album. But if you're interested in hearing Scott Joplin's masterpieces as they were meant to be heard, look elsewhere."
4,This book is a must for anyone cruiseing the Upper Miss. R.,"Captain Ron's book begins with the early French explorers and hardy fur trappers. He covers the history of the paddle-wheel steamboats from the first one on the Mississippi River in 1811, the ""NEW ORLEANS"", to the founding and growth of the paddle-wheel steamboat companies on the upper Mississippi River, from passenger and freight steamboats to excursion paddle-wheel steamboats fo today. Added to all this history are stories and tales from river pilots about the names and landmarks along the upper Mississippi River. Reading this book is like riding in the pilot house listing to Captain Ron telling his river stories."
1,What customer service?,"If I were you I would think twice before ordering this product. I ran into a unit problem immediately and called customer service for a solution. Was told they would fax a return auth. within 24 hours. Didn't happen. Called again in a week, had to start the process again. I was promised contact within 24 hours. Didn't happen. Called a week later, now told there are no replacements in stock. Talked to a useless supervisor who did not offer any solutions (not even any concern) and was quite condescending. If this is how Viewsonic regards their customers they can do without me, and I hope this saves someone from a similar situation. The product receives a zero for performance (since it was defective out of the box), the company also rates a zero for performance."
2,one shortcoming,My research on this product left me with the idea that it had everything I needed to get video to a remote monitor by wireless connection but does not mention the need for the transmitting computer to have a wireless Ethernet adapter until I get it out of the box. :(
2,Your Mileage may vary (but probably not),Work very spotty with some laptops / PCs and not others (Only works with one of 5 machines?) {Installed exactly the SAME on each one. I can't figure out why?} Tech Support is hopeless. On-line Support is non-existent. It takes over your computer and doesn't let go; have to re-boot to restore normal network services. I would NOT buy again.
2,Too Slow To Be Useful,"I bought this adaptor to run a projector in a church. Sounded great, I could mount a projector from the celing and not run 150 ft of cable, it would even be cheeper. We just run powerpoint, this unit slows your computer down drasticly. I have tried 2 different laptops, both with core 2duo processors. I have to keep away from slides with very much transitions. Image is jumpy, not just on the projector, but on the computer monitor when connected. Tried to show a movie at the church, and forget it. At the lowest res. video was jumpy.As for the sound you can easily bypass having to use this box for sound by going into your audio properties and switching to your normal audio output. You just have to do this every time you connect.Tech Support has very limited knowlage on this item. Great idea, needs much work in todays HD world."
2,2010 update,"We bought the WPG-150 several months ago to use with PowerPoint presentations at our school. Installation is simple given that the software is downloaded directly from the gateway itself... NOT true of other gateways. I'd give it 5 stars except that it sets itself as the default network over all others within range. So if you don't remember that little fact, the next time you connect, you will automatically connect to the viewsonic network, and not your local area network... ie ""How come the network printer is no longer available. After reseting the network to no avail I discovered I was connected to the ViewSonic instead. It would be nice have that choice.UPDATE!!!! BUYER BEWARE... THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT SUPPORT WINDOWS 7. I contacted tech support and they suggested I either DOWNGRADE my computer to XP (ie... erase ALL my files) or UPGRADE TO A NEWER GATEWAY... (that they probably don't support either!!!GOOD PRODUCT... CUSTUMOR SUPPORT STINKS"
3,Somewhat sparse,"Let me say up front that what I look for in a non-fiction book is simple and straight forward directions. This book (as the author admits) is very repetitive and could be edited down to about ten pages for me. What is presented seems to be accurate and makes sense, but I am uncomfortable that the author and his editors do not know a ""ferrule"" from ""feral."" (""Hanger types include nail and feral, screw and feral,...). What else is wrong that I don't recognize?He does present some very good photos of correct gutter installations and explains how and why they are important. He also evaluates some of the gadgets sold for the bottom of downspouts.He normally advises against gutter leaf screens, but sometimes recommends then. This is confusing.I wish he included more specifics on installing drains around the house such as how the installation would change with soil types.I am glad I purchased and read the book, but think it is priced a bit high for the amount of information it contains."
4,The most beautiful one in the world,"Sleaze with heightened sentience, that's what I'd call this book. Ms. Keogh's got a way with words, coming up with brilliant phrases like ""some dark tunnel in whose murky halls the phallic sign demanded tears."" Her unique manner of describing things let me see the world from a fresh perspective, and I'll take as much of that as I can get! It's a large part of why I read, truth be known.A warning: there are no likable people to be found within these pages. Not a hero, not a heroine, just a passel of cruel, confused, psychologically messed-up individuals. I got the impression Keogh was forever looking down on her characters-- which is her right; after all, she IS the Creator-- and the whole ""aren't these people a sad, pathetic lot?"" tone made this a depressing read. Nothing wrong with depression (or ""realism"", as it's also known), but I thought I'd warn others who might be interested because Depressing is a bad word to a lot of people. Happy reading!"
3,A great story that should have been a better book.,"The story in this book is powerful enough to hold a reader in spite of poor presentation. It's a story about an equally unique boy and horse, united by chance. Both are good at what they do, a cut above the rest, but not flashy. Together they are faced with the toughest test they have ever known, and come through with flying colors.The book's front flap review, however, is the best piece of writing in the book. The author writes clear and gripping action episodes, but organizes the book poorly. Background info, recollections of past events, and slightly preachy social commentary clutters and slows the story line.It still manages to be a rewarding read, and worth the patience you may have to summon through the tedious parts."
1,Slow and tired,This book is so slow and boring that if it was a movie you would get up and walk out. The people that gave this book 5 stars must be friends and family of the author. The only reason I gave it 1 star is because 0 stars wasn't an option.
5,"A wonderful book for young and old,","I really enjoyed OLD BLACK very much. The entire story was pleasant, exciting and easy reading. The warmth of love between a young boy and his horse were beautifully expressed. If some of our young kids were given the opportunity to grow up as this youngster did their lives would be changed and they would grow into a new, more caring generation."
5,Incredible piece of hallucinatory prose,"An incredible piece of early surrealistic French literature that perhaps transcends this realm. When reading it, one writhes from disgust while nearing ecstasy, and crawls into the depths of human insanity with a chilling enjoyment. ""If I exist, I am not another."""
3,MIA,"How can a book subtitled ""The Protestant Origins of American Political Thought"" omit the political thoughts and influences of Roger Williams and William Penn?"

1,Doesn't work all that well,"I've always been a fan of 3M products, but their glass cleaner does not work all that well and leaves streaks behind."
4,Breakthrough for scholars of Bible and psychology,Absolutely must-read for anyone who wishes to use psychological methodology to interpret the Bible. New all-inclusive history of psychological perspective on the Bible. Technical info may inhibit layperson from full understanding but a must-read anyway.
5,Without too many platitudes..,"Simply great music, I wish I could have been there at the beginning, but I'm glad I have a piece of history today."
5,Dawson's Creek The Begining of Everything Else,This is my favorite. I love the show and knowing what all ready happened is fun. The way you can feel their emotions and see the setting is amasing.
3,The book was alright ........,"The Beginning Of Everything Else was basically like watching the first episode of Dawson's Creek. I am a fan of the show, but I didn't really care for this book. After seeing the first episode, I don't feel like reading a not really good adaptation of it."
3,Pretty Good,"For many of the die hard DC fans out there (and I know there are many) I utterly reccomend picking up this book. Sure, it's just basically the novelization of the first 2 1/2 epsiodes (""Emotions in Motion"", ""Dirty Dancing"", and the beginning of ""Prelude to a Kiss"") but it's great to have just when you need a fix. In a few years the show will be so different that you won't be able to remember when it was just the four of them, or back when Dawson was completely clueless. (Remember when Brenda and Dylan were on 90210?) This book will help bring back the good ol' days."
4,"Sent from the digital God's but, ridiculous price","I love this Sony 4 GB High Speed Memory Stick PRO. It's fast, it has lot's of space, & easy to use. It can save up to 3,000 photos on one of my sony digital cameras (DSC-p93) at about 5 mp, also it can save about 18000 at VGA, and it can save about 1hr of video (mpeg 1) at 640x480. But It's just that it cost to much money. I payed less for my external 200gb hard drive. So took away a star for that. Quick note: The price has gotten a lot better since it first came out though. The only reason I got the card at this price was because, spring brake was coming up. The price may not be the best. But it really felt good not to run out of space."
5,Inspiring,"This writer has captured her own misery as a damaged child and addicted adult in a brutally honest and wonderfully written book of poems. Her refusal to give in to her demons and her her desire for recovery are truly inspiring. This is a great read, especially for addicts and family members or friends of addicts."
4,another dose of Dexter,"This DVD easily could have been a 5 star, however the visual acuity is substandard for the day. This suprised me as the Iowa concert is of the same year and is quite good. That said, this concert when it comes on is really blurry like 50's video, but just like those, when they move onto the stage it gets acceptable. The artists are the same, this one is 58 min. long with the songs being, in order, On Green Dolphin Street, Polka Dots and Moonbeams, and Tanya. The performance is fantastic, you will not be disappointed, unless you are expecting the exact original versions. As with all great artists, they can not do something the same way over and over, that is stagnation, believe me that is not jazz. As a Dexter fan I wouldn't do without this one, in spite of it's short-comings. Until we can time travel, this is what we have."
5,St Paul Florensky,"St Paul's martydom might not quite vindicate all his speculative theology... but somehow, in spite of everything, he was still a man of the church, something which can't be said for most of his sophiological colleagues, or for any of his ideological descendants."
2,Calphalon scraper,The scraper is sort of rounded-in so it's not very good at scraping the bowl. I've gotten better scrapers for less money.
5,Calphalon Silicone Large Scraper,Great product. Just I was looking to purchase. Has the quality and colors that I was look for.This is a must purchase item.
5,Original Music From the Soul,"I love three and a quarter, They have created an original sound for themselves and this album is a must for any blaze-heads. Also when i listen to it i sometimes do a thick, sticky piss"
2,No Pins,"Got this to install in my car because it came with the plug to install ...BUT it doesn't come with the pins to crimp onto the wire ...so basically if you wish to use this MAP sensor then you need to find what pins are required by the plug, purchase, and install them. I ordered a new one from bosch with came with the plug and pins at a lower price and with a better sensor rating and better recommended for the same purpose. If Amazon doesn't have the pins for this and you ordered one then you might be able to get them from Fry's or Grainger."
4,Texsport Trekking Pole,"Texsport Trekking PoleSatisfied! Finger shaping made hand grip slightly uncomfortable, Strap OK after figuring out how change loop size. Shame it doesn't collapse to a shorter length for packing in suitcase (makes it a pain in the A to take on trip)one more collapsing section can't add much to cost. Excellent buy for price. As a trekking pole it worked for me:)"
2,Broke on Second Hike,"The pole arrived in apparently good working condition. The pole features a sleek design which is adjustable to your height. It worked fine the first hike I went on, which was mostly on flat terrain around a lake. My second hike was through rockier terrain, but I was surprised when the bottom third of the pole suddenly snapped off at the joint. When I looked closely at the pole where it broke off, I noticed the break was irregular along the interior plastic, and that the pole was truly busted.I give the pole two stars (instead of one) because I found the handle quite comfortable, and the appearance good, considering how little I paid for the pole. I did not expect the pole to last forever, but I am frustrated that it broke after less than three hours of moderate use."
4,"Not as advertised, but I like them","I like the poles, but they're not exactly as advertised. They have a rubber handle (not cork) and they're red (not black as shown in picture). However, they have an extra spongy handle beneath the main grip and the shock absorbing spring is really good. Great price for a good product."
1,Very little worth,"This short book, written from a Protestant fundamentalist view, reads like a collection of a few sermons, (certainly not academic!). The authors have a few good insights. For example, that the ecological crisis does not come from Christianity, but from modernity, but then, while praising medieval, traditional Christianity, they don't seem to see that this is contrary to Protestantism. Furthermore most the book rests on special pleading (not even solidly grounded, but using a citation here or there from other fellow protestants), some citations from the Biblical writings or some historical misunderstanding."
3,Seriously flawed... but still entertaining.,"This movie is seriously flawed in so many aspects. The dialog is both written and often times delivered in an amateurish fashion, the lighting is some of the worst I've ever seen in a professional film and the actions of the characters in response to their surroundings is simply not within reason. Nonetheless... it's an entertaining film. At times it makes you grimace and roll your eyes with its shortcomings, but it remains entertaining in the manner of the old sci-fi serials such as Flash Gordon, et. al. And, of course, Fiona Hutchison is pleasing eye candy. Certainly not a classic, but not a bad way to pass some time."
4,Biggles-air adventurer,"an afecienado special for all 'Biggles' fans, an absolutely impossible story that Cptn W.E.Johns, the original author would have no doubt spluttered over in the best 1920s-40s british tradition. But I loved every minute of it.Of course Biggles could fly a Jetranger copter with-out lessons, he was an accompished Sopwith Camel pilot. A seriously 'Own Boys Annual' thumping good yarn and I recommend it to all that enjoy such things."
3,Enjoyable,"I have had this movie in one form or another for years. It is certainly not an A level movie, but I find it purely enjoyable. I do not expect to have to think, just watch and enjoy."
3,Do You Remember Love?,"Let me start by saying I have no regrets with the purchase since this has, and probably never will have an official american release.Now, obviously this is a bootleg, and given that, it's pretty darn good. The japanese audio and english subtitles are well done and the picture is crisp.There is no official american dub, that parts a scam...and the english audio is god awful. I mean, people who speak broken english would be offended by it.Overall, at the price and unavailability of an official release, this is a good buy for a darn good bootleg."
3,pro compe pro runner light bar,"I bought this light bar to mount on my 1989 toyota 4runner. overall it looks great once installed. unfortunatly it is not as easy to mount as described. It is not a direct fit, make sure you have a grinder on hand to grind away metal the interfears with the lower mount placemnt. without grinder this would not have been able to fit on my truck. and bolts dont fit, get some bolts from your local harware store that match the ones currently on your bumper to fill the top holes. once bar is mounted it looks awesome!!! It just wasn't as easy as described! I hope this helps"
3,Peels,"Not that impressed. Use it over No More Wraps and not sure if its the No Wraps or not, but it chips and peels within 2-3 days. I think Instant Artificials is better."
4,Great Wrestling Book,"My review on this book is a pretty good review. This book wouldn't exactly be my first choice, but it was a good book. If you were into wrestling I would highly recomend this book. It has a lot of wrestling moves and some terms listed. There are some funny parts as well. I would not recomend this book to children under 5th grade and would strongly suggest that you would at least be 10 or 11. This is a good book and I highly suggest it."
4,Theres a girl in my hammerlock,I liked this book alot because it shows you that it is posible that girls can do anything they want if they set thier minds to it. Just like in this book that proves that a 13-year-old girl can play on the wrestling team just like the boys. As she follows her dream of getting her secret chrush Eric DeLong to notice her it soon fails. In the begining most of the boys make fun of her because she joins the boys team. But soon after a while she soon gets the respect she needs.
3,There's a Girl in My Hammerlock,"Thirteen-year-old Maisie joins her school's formerly all-male wrestling team and tries to last through the season. She stuggles to overcome people making fun of her because she is a girl playing a boy's sport. She has to deal with opposition from other students, her best friend, and her own teammates.Maisie is a good wrestler. She is determined to wrestle and not let anyone interfere."
2,Very used Ready-Aire Heater Core,"I was extremely disappointed when I got my heater core, I read the description and never saw that this was a re-manufactured core. The core I got had a new top and bottom but the middle was rusty, cooling fins were bent and looked like it had been through at least a couple hundred thousand miles of use. Core was not even repainted black like the original. Hopefully it will work better than it looks, but I don't have a lot of confidence from the first appearance."
1,***NOT THE ORIGINAL HIT PERFORMANCES!!!***,"the title says it all. avoid this st. clair release. a rip-off if there ever was one. Amazon requires 20 words for a review, this CD collection only needs one: BOGUS."
5,Mass now and 4eva,"book: new, too costly, too big, had to rebind it, not amazon's fault. content: if you forgot where your Puritan blood is, look harder: did you REALLY wanna sail 3 months on a ship from London to infect Native Americans? the answer was yes, amaf ...."
2,this book is not very helpful - and it was written in 97,"Especially with that title, you would expect alot of info on CAD for fashion right? Maybe see things like; how you would create patterns, even 3-D representations, or create prints and colors for fabrics, where I might look for resources on manufacturers and software providers, etc. Well, there are countless mentions in the book of people who use CAD for tons of various things, but almost no mention of HOW any of those people go about it. In some instances the writer is like: yeah, this internet thing is great for selling clothing, web sellers can actually superimpose different colors onto the same garments! yipee. You get the picture, OLD, and not really hands-on at all, more like an informationless overview."
1,Not very helpful.,This was sadly disappointing and did not really talk about how to do anything but rather how CAD for design was being used all over the industry. I would think that a book titled CAD for Fashion Design would actually show you how to do CAD for fashion design.
4,LCD display shade? -KOOL!,"I thought this was a great idea, so I bought one.It snaps on the camers nicely, and opens and closes very nice as well.The branding on the cover by Delkin doesn't really bother me since it was done nicely. It looks cool on the camera, and also does a great job of protecting the screen from scratches.I can't seem to break the habit of trying to look in the viewfinder while it is still in the open position, and it does not feel good to smash your face into it when it's open! You'll need to close it BEFORE taking more pictures! I still like this item, however, to be honest I still can't see the pictures on the screen in bright sunlight."
1,Fragile!,"After scratching the Nikon LCD protector on my first hike withthe D200 I thought some better protection was a good idea.This cover looked solid, and I rarely look at the LCD whileout for the day, but after my first hike, the cover fell off.It has two thin plastic clips that attach to the camera, one atthe top, and one at the bottom, and the bottom one had broken off.I'll buy a pack of Nikon covers instead."
3,Eye-glass wearers BEWARE!,"Before I replaced my Nikon D70 I used the D70 version of this and loved it. In spite of it being fragile, I appreciated two benefits: 1) It allowed better LCD viewing in sunny conditions. 2) It kept my breath from fogging the LCD as I studied the viewfinder image. It is the second of these that I most appreciated, and even though the unit was fragile, each time it broke I bought another.So, when I upgraded to a D200 I wanted the Delkin protector that fit my new camera. I even bought two so I would have a backup. What a surprise when a week later I began to experience clouded vision in my left eye. It didn't take long to realize that the design of the protector and D200 place the edge higher up. The result is that each time I looked through the viewfinder, the left lens of my glasses bumped the corner of the protector. I've now spent $100+ to replace the left lens of my glasses, and I have two of these sitting unusued in storage.Beware this product if you use eye-glasses."
3,Better concept than execution...,"I bought one of these when they first came out. They work well for what they're intended (better than the ""bellows"" type shades which stick out so you can't keep them on when the camera is put into a case), but, as another reviewer said, you have to remember to shut it before you raise the viewfinder to your eye to take a picture.Mine fell apart pretty quickly with the back half separating from the front half (the mounting-half). I could have glued it back together, so it wasn't a big deal, but at the time, I didn't bother.It just might work better with the side-blinds removed, just leaving the top in pace, then it'll fold down automatically when it goes past your cheek as it's raised to your eye."
1,Ruined With Aspartame,A not sugar free gum does not need fake sugar chemicals.And it tastes worse too. They ruined it.Stay away.
3,"a good (but not great, live album)","Horslips live is an album with a great lineup of songs from several of their albums. If you're not familiar with horslips, they're a great mix of traditional Irish music and rock. This live album, however, is not the best example of how awesome horslips can be live. Johnny Fean's guitar work is not as tight as it can be and most of the songs are better on the studio versions. It's still a good album and one worth having if you are a Horslips fan. If I were to only own one live Horslips album, however, I would wait until ""The Belfast Gigs"" is rereleased. It is a much better example of Horslips live."
4,Where is my dictionary?,"Great topic. But sometimes seems to read out of focus. I am not seminary educated, (in fact 4yrs of college was all I could stand). It appears it might be more directed toward the author's peers, versus the ""everyday evangelist"" - as myself. I work with a bunch of programmers (my peers) who are 20-30yrs old (I'm 40ish) - and I did find the book to be helpful in understanding a bit of their world view.I kept a dictionary handy while reading this book - and found as I looked up the words that I don't hear in every day conversation, there could have been a half-dozen more effective ways to make the same statement. (Okay, so my vocabulary got stretched a little <grin>)I did like how the author steps you through the case for Jesus' subversiveness (where's my dictionary?). I would like to have heard a little more on ""Relating Christ to a New Generation..."". Overall= good reading, interesting perspective on our culture, and reiteration on some solid truths."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Barbarian bloke busts up the burgundy and beaujolais set.Or, a bit of the wizard of oz redone in seventies trippy and gauzy decadent sf style. Those of the lower class are kept ignorant by means of technological tricks, etc, in that old fashioned oz style. Here, the witches are most definitely a lot better looking, and a lot hornier."
2,not what i hoped for,I called to make sure the lens I was buying was going to be compatible with my camera. I was assured it would. That was over a year ago and I still can't figure out how to get it to work.Not worth my money.
5,I still love Bobby,"I purchased the book. I cannot wait to read it. It took me by surprise, he has a book. I know I will enjoy reading his book. The reviews were great by other readers. After reading it, I will write another review. Thanks for this opportunity to read about your favorite idol."
5,Bobby always was a gentlman and superstar personified!!,"I truly enjoyed reading this book. It made me feel closeto Bobby all over again. He always did and always will put me ina wonderful mood. Reading the full story behind the headlineswas very intimate. It was a one sitting reading. We'll alwaysbe remembering you, babe. Donna G. 03/10/97"
5,It made me love Bobby all over again!,"Bobby Sherman's book is warm,compassionate and caring like him. I really love his intimate stories about his dad and mom, sister and fans. He should write a sequel like Davy Jones is printing, to update his career, now that he is part of the Teen Idol Tour or Herman,Sherman and Jones. At 55, he is still a hunk!!!!!I have him linked on my website"
4,Money Rules,"""Bangkok Hilton"" is a story of how money and family links helped an innocent young woman got away from a death penalty in Thailand for being unknowingly used as a mull by an attractive seducer-professional drug-trafficker, and revenge over his crimes following.Regrettably, not much changed since this warning work appeared in Australia ages ago."
3,"great film, average quality","This is a great film with some good acting for its time, its just a shame the quality of the DVD is not so good, warbling music and fuzzy picture."
5,Great game,"Trophy Bass 3D was the first fishing sim I bought. TB4 is much better and has several very cool features. I like the point-of-view camera view (angler view). It gives you a real ""you are there"" perspective. The fish graphics are a bit dated (remember this is a 2000 game). The lure selection is incredible, and so is the variety of lakes offered. Something for everyone. Do a google search and download the demo. You will end up buying the full game. I switch back between this game and Bass Fishing 2003."
3,it could be better,I am a big fishing games lover BUT this one is so so... Hope somebody will make a good game...one day
4,"Good DVD, now it's a tribute, too....","Don Bernstine passed away unexpectedly in his sleep in April 2009. He was a great friend and a tireless enthusiast of rock and roll, as this DVD illustrates. Even when we were barely out of high school, major bands used to call him up and fly him to wherever they were, just because they liked hanging out with him. Hanging with Don was the most fun I ever had, and he brought out the best in me. I'm glad this DVD shows him doing what he loved."
5,Great Item,I had the chance to catch the discussion of this DVD on RON AND FEZ today on XM radio and ordered it right away. Very cool stories and a great deal of music history is discussed on this DVD. I can't wait for it to arrive!
1,"Flimsy, legs do break off quickly","I would have to second the other reviewer's comment that the legs are flimsy and break off. We've owned the doll less than 24 hours and the legs broke immediately, the belt also broke in the first day. The problem with the legs are that they're held onto the body by a rubber band attached to a flimsy plastic rod in both legs, and the rods break. For $25, I expect a toy to last longer than a day. Please improve the quality of this toy!!!"
4,"Works Great, But Not For Off-Label Use...","This box works awesome for watching TV.Pros:It was easy to install (although I am pretty geeky; I can see where some people could sit scratching their heads for hours) and the quality is great. I've had this thing laying around for a few years after being gifted it and not having a real use for it, and today I hooked it up.Cons:There is about a two-second delay from anything happening to it showing up for you, so if you're trying to play any video games through it, be sure to record your attempts and send them to me, because they'll be really funny."
5,This is a GREAT product!,"I purchased this product as part of building a TV/DVR computer for my daughter to take to college. This product comes Vista Media Center ready. It has everything you need including a certified Media Center remote (with the Green Button!).I plugged the USB cable into the computer and immediately Vista Media Center went out and found the correct driver. I plugged in the cable TV lines (2) after splitting it with the provided cable splitter, and started watching TV just like that! It is truly ""plug and play"".NOTE - This product does exactly what is advertised. So, the 2 tuners are truly only analog, and won't pick up QAM or other digital channels. Also, it doesn't accommodate a digital antenna. But for basic analog cable it is just the ticket."
1,yankeyboy,"I found this item to be useless. I couldnèt use it, it didnèt seem to be compatible with the Tvs for which it was bought. Had to return it."
1,Don't Bother! Not Digital Ready!,This does not support the new digital (ATSC) transmission so on April of 2009 it will go dark. They really should be giving them away at this point. The interesting thing is that they don't tell you this in the description and by law every retailer is required to post a notice on anything with an old analog tuner stating that it will not work after April 09. So don't even bother.....
4,pretty good dual tuner,"I was replacing an identical unit that I fried by using the wrong ac/dc adapter. Replacement works fine, like the other one. Price was 75% off the original price. Service and delivery were perfect.Many problems with Windows Media Center but not with the tuner.Works fine with my Comcast analog cable."
4,The Alden children stop the artifact thieves!,"I am 8 years old and I have read at least 40 of the Boxcar Children books. In this book,the Alden children encounter a thief who cheats people out of there old,rare artifacts for 10 dollars. My favorite characters are Violet and Benny. My favorite part of the book is when the Alden children are allowed to teach school in the schoolhouse. Over all,this is one of my favorite books in the series and I think you will like it too."
1,Needs the Awesome Bass playing of A.J. Blackman!,"To much like bubble gum music. Out dated, needs more harmonica."
1,Needs the Awesome Bass playing of A.J. Blackman!,"To much like bubble gum music. Out dated, needs more harmonica"
4,Excellent Mix of Styles,"I just got the CD and I listened to it 3 times alreay. I really like the Latin/Spanish influence combined with an excellent classical mix and Jazz feel. I can't wait for the next CD. To bad ""AJ Blacklist"" doesn't understand."
3,"Sounds so, so....",RAP AND HIP HOP BEAT MISTER! Gots some sick beats fo sho!Rap Beats Hip Hop Beats All Instrumental Music Volume 2
1,Sizing marking is defective - belts are super long.,"I bought this belt for my husband and based my size choice on the Italian sizing system which we are familiar with but the bel;ts is mismarked and is actually quite a few sizes larger than the labeled size. As the previous reviewer says, the small is probably big enough for a 39 inch waist because I ordered thye medium (120) and its big enough for a 44 inch waist."
3,incorrect sizing,Beautiful belt but Amazon has incorrectly sized the item. Small/medium will fit a 39 1/2-42 inch waist while the Med/Large is two inches longer.
1,"The ball was dropped here, not the bombs!","This could have been a classic by including Pearl Harbor, Midway, Coral Sea, but instead, this starts out in mid-flight near Pearl with a wave of Japanese planes all over. no build up, no strategy, no thinking. Simply start firing and kiss your butt goodbye as you splash in to the harbor. This is a ""could have been"" ."
3,Good buy...,After purchasing this add-on for CFS I got what I expected. Abacus is a great add-on for authenticity and will play well on the Zone. These planes are not mods but authentic styled and responding planes. The control panels were quite poorly designed and looked cheesy....
4,Thomas Christmas,My 3 year old son loves Thomas and we got him this movie for Christmas. It was perfect for the occasion and he loves the movie.
1,Unplayable DVD,The DVD is designed for American video players and useless in the UK. This should not be sold by Amazon to UK.
5,A few quiet moments,"Great gift! This gave Mummy, Daddy, Nanny and Grampa a few quiet moments during a very busy time. Good show everyone!"
5,best wax ever,"I've been using this brand of wax for several years now and have tried many others within over 30 years. This wax is above all others. It offers exceptional protection, leaves an ultra high lustre shine, lasts a long time before requiring another waxing and beads water extremely well. I use it on 3 vehicles and wouldn't use anything else. It's easy to apply and just as easy to wipe off."
5,Great Wax,This wax goes on smooth and comes off without hard rubbing would recommend it for your classic car.
3,Very fun game. But you must find Real Red Mod for it.,"5 stars for fun. 3 stars for game overall.I believe this is best of the Close Combat series, despite its flaws. Unlike the rest of the Close Combat series, CC3 follows you throughout the entire war. If you are good you can keep your units from Operation Barbarossa in '41 all the way to the fall of Berlin in '45(if they are lucky enough to survive). The more battles your men survive, the better they become at fighting. This feature makes you want to keep your men alive and cheer when they make it, and feel sorry when they meet their demise.What makes this game even better is the 'Real Red' mod(which you will have to search on the internet for and does not come with the retail version), which allows for more additional units (i.e. Panzer VI and VIe command tanks, Lend-Lease units such as Shermans, Valentines and Crocodiles) and winter camouflage (during winter of course)."
3,Ok but theres a better game,This game is ok i would recomend the most recent title of this game because the graphics would be way better and also the game so u choose
3,Product review.,"This is a book good for general idea, however, you must be careful as to what and where you purchase to consume for treatment. Should obtain more info from other books."
3,Do it yourself somewhere else,"From reading the product description I was expecting more than the authors past experiences. Whereas the author has many ""real life"" medical needs that he has delt with, the content is ""vague""."
2,not what i thought,did you know there was other stuff out there? The author spends countless pages telling you he wrote another book and had to revise it. He then spends chapter after chapter telling you he can't tell you anything.
1,Disappointed,"Book is incredibly basic and doesn't by any standard cover the material it's advertised to represent.You could title this book, ""Do research on what Veterinary Meds can do to help you."" I think this isdesigned to make money and little more. NOT RECOMMENDED"
1,Full of half-truths and lies,"I don't recommend this book. As with most books by survial author ""Ragnar Benson"" it is full of innaccuracies and half truths. There is some basic information on setting bones, stitching wounds, and other simple topics, but it is not very well addressed -- It's almost as if the author has no idea what he's talking about and is simply repeating urban knowledge thirdhand. As far as his information of how to aquire the various supplies, there are far better, easier, and more legal ways than he describes here. The misinformation presented here is likely to get you in trouble. ""DITCH MEDICINE"" is a far better book."
1,Just do your EMT,"Full of less than half information, just do your EMT Basic license at a local community college. Its a real qualification and you know that you met a standard. After all, people are not legos and in an emergency you want skills you can depend on...because thats exactly what you'll be doing."
2,"Long on drug acquisition, short as a medical material","The author spends a lot of time telling you how to obtain drugs normally available only through doctors (and ranting about government control) while not spending a lot of time on the medical aspects that the title leads you to believe.I suppose that his suggestions about forging prescriptions shouldn't be surprising when his other books tell readers how to gunrun for profit, acquire new id, build claymore mines, etc."
4,Good info to have and share,"""Do It Yourself Medicine"" contains much information that you won't get from your family doctor or the typical Medic. At the current time, many Veterinarian medications are available and being purchased and used by farmer/ranchers. Most mentioned are available without a Vet's prescription from local sources or thru mail order Vet supply companies. (use google). I think you will find the cost of this do-it-yourself guide well worth the price you are paying for it. As a matter of policy, I have to advise, as Ragnar does, that the novice should only consider administering these treatments and medications when in dire and isolated circumstances when no better option exists for the patient. That being said, every family and wilderness travel group should have a trained and experienced Medic. This little book will prove to be very valuable to them.DH"
1,Just Downright Dangerous,"A listing of the errors and inaccuracies in this book would fill a small paperback in itself. If a person hasn't been trained in the basics of emergency medical science, some of the procedures advocated in this book could prove lethal to a patient if performed by an amateur.The book can best be characterized this way: even the author's method for forging prescriptions is obsolete.If you're looking for a felony conviction, this is your book. If you're interested in sound do-it-yourself emergency healthcare procedures, try one of the books recommended by the other medical professionals who reviewed this one."
3,This Pedometer is OK,This pedometer is OK but not the greatest I've ever seen. It doesn't stay attached to my pants waist or pocket very well. It tends to fall off frequently. I would recommend a different type.
3,A wide varity of fighter aircraft from WWII to present,"Excellent aircraft graphics, poor scenery graphics. Preset flight situations make carrier landings less time consuming than if you launched and recovered from sctatch. Different carriers for different parts of the world. It took a while to get used to the keys for controling the tail hook. Uses weather from FS, and can also use some airfields from FS selection. Check the after burners out! Launching aircraft is bush. Fun if you are bored and looking for that challenge."
4,Interesting and Thought Provoking,"Reviewd by Robert Young, Lane ESDFor more reviews visit www.lane.k12.or.us/bookreviewInspired by her son's photographs, Jane Yolen creates an interesting and thought-provoking series of poems about water in its many aspects. Her poems are rhythmic and fluently worded--grand examples for students of all ages. There is some variety in the types of poems included, but more would make this book even better. Most of the photographs are of a very high quality. This book has many examples of word usage as well as fluent writing, and it would be a good model for using pictures to inspire poetry."
4,More excellent work from Josh Lanyon,"I am now officially hooked on Josh Lanyon's Adrien English series of books. ""The Hell you Say"" was outstanding, just as the two books before it. I loved the wit, sarcasm, and humor of the characters and situations in Josh's previous books, and this one was no exception. Thanks Josh for another fine story. I look forward to beginning the next book in the series!"
4,The ghouls of Christmas present,"A bookstore clerk receives spooky and threatening phone calls at work and flees for his life. The store is later marked with a strange symbol and the owner (our hero), feeling threatened himself, sets off to investigate. As the bodies pile up it appears that a Satanic cult might be responsible. This read was a marvelous page-turner that kept me up to the wee small hours. Sad to say, then, that the ending is ""curious"" at best and not a surprise. Several loose ends may have been left for the next in this series. I will go back and read the earlier entries, however. The writing is quite good here."
5,Enjoying Adrien English,"I really enjoy this series, it shows growth in the characters, is very funny, and has original mysteries. As a bookseller, myself, I identify a little with Adrien. I like how as an ordinary person, he gets in all kinds of trouble and gets out of the trouble in original ways! I can hardly wait for the next book."
1,Not Appropriate For Elementary Age Children,"This book contains too many sexual references and curse words, and it uses God's name inappropriately throughout the story. Books like this should have a warning label informing parents that some of its material may not be suitable for children."
5,The book is no disaster!,"This book is wonderful -- a really true look at the humiliations and joys of friendship and school. Alli, the main character, has such a good soul, and is trying so hard to be what we all want so much, which is, well, to be . . . liked and appreciated and seen for who we are (and not the underwear on our clothes!). A beautiful book!"
1,It is funny but bad.,"The beginning is VERY funny, but then it starts swearing and talking about kissing, and worse. I stopped reading at chapter 3. I do NOT recommend this for middle-schoolers maybe for adults, but by then you will be to old for,""The Fashion Disaster That Changed My Life."""
1,Inappropriate,"My daughter is in middle school and assures me that this is NOT how the kids at her school speak and behave. Sure, there are the oddball exceptions, but why do we feel the need as a society to appeal to the crudest, most ill-mannered behaviors to attract readers?It is sad to see so many talented writers, this one included, make the choice that they need to include profanity and sexual references in order to sell to this demographic. The truth is there is an entire group of tweens/teens that would be reading their books if not for the unfortunate inclusion of, well, trash. While I hate to waste anything worth saving, Thirteen and The Fashion Disaster That Changed My Life will be joining a few other books at the bottom of our trash can where they belong, as in my opinion these books are not."
1,Not appropriate,"The concept of the book sounded good. It appeared that it would be humorous and a relatable story. I was offended that they assume that young girls are this raunchy and exposed to such inappropriateness. I simply do not understand why people choose to include such sexual content and language. Newsflash: everyone is not exposing their young girls to such filth. Why not bring your reader up a level instead of belittling them. I am mad at myself for not researching the book better before my daughter brought the book to me and said, ""mom this isn't appropriate for me."" Seriously folks - just write for adults and you can say whatever you like! My daughter saw one of her other books at a book fair and said, ""well i won't be reading anymore of her books!"" My daughter is in the 6th grade!! Disgusted!!"
5,Excellent!,"I personally enjoyed this book. I must admit that some expieriences were realistic, and some were not, but that is what I love about it. I would never read a book that just re-states my entire life. Some of the things that were said to be inappropriate definitely caught me off guard, but they honestly don't bother me anymore. I hear worse things everyday. In my opinion, the appropriate age to read this book is 7th grade. The reason being is that the main character in the book is in 7th grade, and that it is the age where many kids start to mature. Overall, this was a very well-written and enjoyable book!"
1,This story could have been told very differently ...,"It is just too bad. After going through this book myself, I asked my wife to look at it. It was a no brainer - there was no WAY we were going to let our little girl read it. Cursing, explicit body parts, etc. I can't believe someone actually thinks this is appropriate for middle-school girls. I can see what the author was trying to accomplish, but the way the story was conveyed really leaves a lot to be desired. All the bad language and sexual subject matter could easily have been left out. There is simply too much of what is wrong, and not enough of what is right. I hope that in the future she decides to take a different path when she writes for young ladies. As a group they need something that inspires them and serves as a model for good behavior, not something like this."
1,Sucks,"I got one of these mounts when I bought a used boom pole. I don't know why anyone would buy this mount when for a bit more you can get the Rycote one. Like there other guy said, you have to criss cross the bands to hold the mic. I just don't trust it. It seems to pick up a lot of handling noise as well compared to the other mounts I have used."
5,Maxon OD808,This is a great overdrive pedal with a nice range of adjustment. It pushes your sound without having to push your amp.
4,Wireless Speaker,I find this speaker to be a great idea. I take my wireless speaker over to my kitchen during lunch time to listen to my favorite radio talk show (The Diann Rehm Show) as it is broadcast from my computer. I also use it to listen to my MP3 player. It works so well that I bought a second one to use when the battery is being recharged on the first one.
3,Doesn't work in my house,This is a great idea but all I get is static. I have plaster walls and this doesn't work in my house unless the speaker is in the same room as the TV.
1,"Terrible, poor quality","Just like the reviewer ""Ed"", my first set ""didn't work properly. ""They would shut down and not work after a few minutes."" I would have to jiggle the power cord to get them to work again. I sent the unit back to Sony. They sent me a refurbished unit that has the same exact same problem, but not as often. I'm debating sending it back and trying for a third set. Mainly because, as with the other reviewer, ""the range was not very good and one had to position the speaks just right to make them work."" So, even if the power cord issue is solved, the amount of static and lack of range is disappointing."
4,Great sound for small wireless speaker !!!,"I did read other reviews before I purchased. Like other mentioned, it will turn itself off after about 3-4 minutes after a popping noise, if there is no audio source input. You can plug your MP3 player directly to speaker as well. I don't have any problem to hook it up with 3 audio sources: one from my PC, one from my MP3 palyer, and one from my cellphone. I listen my music any where within my house (about 150 feets) without any problem. If I take it over 150 feets, there is a hissing sound. I give it 4 stars for this reason. Buy it if you love to listsen your music in bathroom, backyard, and basement... as I do.Sound is good quality.Can't beat the price, either... Since my music library is on my pc, it just made sense to use the pc as the source."
4,Portable unit with good sound,"Very portable unit with good sound. Easy to use outside and move around since unit contains both left & right speakers. As a bonus, it contains a separate input for MP3 players, portable CD players, etc. when not using as wireless speakers. Batteries are built-in NiMH, and the manual says to return unit to a Sony dealer when the batteries die. I would prefer replaceable AA batteries."
1,Avoid this item,"I purchased one, it had lots of noise and worse the transmitter power lite would go off and on when this happens you get no sound, I returned that unit and got another, wound up with the same problems. Avoid at all cost!"
1,Keep looking for something better.,"As the previous reviewer says the idea is a great one. I bought this speaker for the very same reason. Except that I wanted to take them outside. The range is suppose to be 150 feet, but I guess that must be without any obstacles in its path. The receiver sensitivity is very poor so it does not take much to get hissing and popping noise similar to your FM car radio. This unit is a FM transmitter and receiver with a very poor sensitivity. The tunning also drifts probably due to cheap electrical components used. BTW I got mine on ebay for $24."
2,Deeply fascinating or just Deeply disturbed?,"Peter Beard has not gotten wiser in his old age. He has given into his vices and chosen the superficial payoffs over any morals. He has found no escape from his aimlessness, no direction from his chaotic meanderings. Where has this man ever really gone? Why has he become so tragic? This book reveals the illusion of greatness, the anticipation of accomplishment. But sadly, decades later, we see how withered and little this man has become. One wonders, was he ever even exceptional? He seemed fearless and passionate. Now, he just seems fatally emphatic and senseless. He is like a machine grinding to a halt."
4,Intricate Look Into A Young Boys Rise Into The Drug Game,"Mr. Thomas wrote an excellent tale about a young man who becomes entangled in the drug game at a very young age. At the age of 12 Anthony (Tone) first lays eyes on a ""G"" and his obsession with getting paper begins. This page turning story is about how money easily lures a youth to the streets. With the Bronx's most notorious projects set as the back drop Tone's life takes many interesting turns. Come follow Tone as he attempts to survive the BX streets in ""No Regrets""!"
3,Good graphics but..,"I thought this would be a nice economical alternative to EA Sports NBA Live. Well from a graphics standpoint, NBA Inside Drive is outstanding. You can tell great care was taken, everything from players, to refs, and the arenas. However they must of overlooked the competitive end. The only way to win in this game is to play the rookie level. I played veteran level several times, trying to put together as lopsided of a match up as I could, and I was getting beat by at least 20 points by teams like the Clippers and Bulls. This game needs some major improvement to make it enjoyable."
3,Great game for the price!,"This is a great game, if you don't feel like spending the money on NBA live '2,000. Latrell spreewell is the best player on the game. The computer is not easy to beat either. Buy this game, you're in for a treat!"
4,An Introduction to Wales,"I found this book to be very well written. Mary Morgan obviously knew her subject well. Once started, the novel was hard to put down. There was a certain suspense until the very end."
3,A pretty good add on to AOE,The Rise of Rome is a pretty good expansion for Age of Empires. It added cool new units like the Scythe Chariot and the Camel. It also gives the new map size and four cool new civilizations. A dissapointment was that they all looked the same. Also the 200 population limit on multiplayer is a nice change. Overall I would give Rise of Rome three stars
4,Age of Empires....worth the money,"This game is very entertaining. It is user friendly. Lets you build an empire that fits your personality...business, warrior, etc."
4,new civilizations and technologies but still lacking,"For anybody who loves Aoe and wants more this game is for you. If you want 4 new civs(Carthaginians,Macedonians,Palmyrans and Romans) new techs such as Martydom(sacrifices preists for enemy unit) and Logistics(each Barracks unit counts for half a unit on the pop limit) and new units like armored elephants,camels and sythe chariots then you should consider getting this game.But this game still has the same feel as the original.The units are just as dumb as before they've just spiced it up little with a few new civs and new units.I definitely like ROR more than the original but you just have to ask your self is it worth the 20 bucks."
2,An expansion like this should be free,"Age of Empires is a great game, and a Roman expansion would be essential. The problem is that there just isn't enough on it. The expansion, being charged for as much as the original game, offers only 5 new units, a couple more civilizations, and 3 more campaigns. There was so much that could have been included in this expansion pack, but there is very little difference with it.The expansion does include, however, improvements to the game such as the ability to cue unit production and to chose the poplulation limit in multiplayer. However, the additions are just not worth the cost. The Gold Edition is a much better value, however, which includes both the original version and the expansion for the same price as the expansion itself."
1,UMmm,What is this sorry excuse for a game?? HORRIBLE GRAFFICS!!! I threw this off a cliff the first day I got it!! then I went down to get it and threw it into the ocean!! when that didn't work I threw if in a fire and burned it!
4,Prophetz Have A Groove,"I jumped at hearing this album because Jerry Goodman is on it, but Steve Vasconcellos is the leader of this outstanding group.Amazon gives no personnel list, so I dug around and found this:Steve Vasconcellos: bassJerry Goodman: violinBrandon Fields: saxophoneOtmaro Ruiz: pianoTadashi Namba: keyboardsLeon ""Ndugu"" Chancler: drumsMunyungo Jackson: percussionEdwing: guitar (3,5)Thomas Burch McMorran: piano (3,5,8)Jeff Richman: guitar (8)Enzo Tedesco: drums (8)a few names I am sure that you will recognize.a review that I found elsewhere gave it a ""smooth jazz"" tag, but the melodic interplay and progressions (and the soloing) goes beyond that genre. atleast to my ears. reminiscent of some ECM artists/recordings, which is not a bad thing. I'm going to buy a couple of MP3 files for working at the computer and such.good effort from one-and-all."
4,fun game,this is a fun game i like it a lot but if you are wondering if should buy this game go to Microsoft.com and download the demo it gives you some of the level free.
3,How far we've come.,"I got this game in Dec 1997 and for months me and my best friend did nothing but play it. At the time it seemed so cool and interesting. Today, it seems dated and dull. Weird isn't it? I have AOE2 and it is much better but that too already seems old hat. Even with all the expansion packs available for this game it will never come close to the complexity of the sequel or Age of Mythology. Buy it if you can find it dead cheap tho."
3,Age of Empires,"This is an ""old"" game compared to current games. It is a bit slow and the features are pretty simple. Graphics don't compare to todays versions. Still it was kind of fun. Each level has a ""trick"" and once you figure out the trick you can win the round. Delivery was great. The seller sold exactly what was advertised. I wanted to play all the AOE games this one was real basic. The grandfather of AOE."
1,"There may be few, but they're all better than this.","What a piece of junk.The majority of the book is in the order of, ""Ah had this littl' hand down in a game in Texas an' the flop came with two little spades, so I pounded the sucker and then ah..."" There are maybe 9 or 10 pages worth of content in the whole book. Most of it comes from McEvoy, and some of it is almost certainly wrong.The section on Pot Limit is of questionable value, since most pot-limit Omaha games spread now are high-low, not straight high.Bob Ciaffone's book is better, and Ray Zee's book is much better. Stick with them."
1,Don't bother!!!,"This grill looked great on Amazon, but it was a disaster the moment it was delivered. First off, the box was completely falling apart, with sharp pieces literally jutting from the sides. When I opened the box, many of the metal pieces were bent way out of shape (such as the bottom piece and the side shelf holders), making for a lopsided grill. In addition, the directions were not at all easy to understand (I have put together a few Weber grills in my day and never had any problems) and I highly recommend you don't drop a single screw/nut/washer, because they don't give you any extras. Don't buy this grill, it's not worth it!"
2,Poorly Packaged,"Received with carton falling apart, pieces dented. Minor cosmetic damage that will turn to rust if not treated."
3,Good at the start.,"This hookah was awesome. Easy to assemble, put off a great taste. My complaint is that its made of very cheap material. After the first 2 weeks, the rubber grommets that keep the hoses secure came loose. No big deal. Then the 2nd month came around. The glue started coming off and the paint started to fade. Keep in mind, I know how to clean a hookah properly and I never mistreated it. Then after the 5th and final month, the glass vase broke at the top where it unscrews from the metal part."
1,NO GOOD,I bought this hookah and we smoked out of it 3 times. On the 3rd time the vase was leaking water. The glass was not broken or cut it was just leaking water from the bottom. I returned it since I was still under the return time. I also had contacted the seller because some of the stuff in his description didn't come and I never recieved a reply from them. Not a very good hookah and very bad customer service.
3,like it,i like the hookah but the only thing i have to complain about is how easy it broke. the second use the port for one of the hoses broke and i had to glue it together to fix and now it works fine.
3,Eh....,"If youre an experienced Hookah smoker its tiny querks will drive you crazy. For a beginner its probably pretty cool. The color is NOT that of the picture. But it is listed under ""midnight silver"" so depends on who ya wanna blame. It DOES NOT come with the cleaner kit despite what the page says. One of the hoses refuses to fit. Is it pretty? Well yea. As a buyer I'm only half satisfied..because will it smoke....we'll see tonight...."
2,Slightly disappointed,"I ordered this hookah as a Christmas gift. Shipping time was great, only took two days. However when I received it in the mail, half of the siding of the box was detached. Hookah pieces falling out every where, not good. Also, the body was not centered with the plate. Crooked lop-sided hookah, not good. Bottom line, assembly & value of materials are not worth the cost of the hookah. I'll probably be returning it."
2,Ridiculous,1. The Hookah shown in the image is not the one that i received.2. No Tweezers3. No Pipe screen4. No assembly instructionsOverall Ridiculous service. I am not gonna buy from this seller again.I advice u not to prefer this seller.
2,Doesn't live up to the title,"One of the best titles ever, too bad the book doesn't live up to it. The short poem-like chapters this books is written in are perfect for short attention spans and the book reads very quickly. The situation with the mother dying, the girl being separated from best friend and boy friend and going to live with mysterious father are good. I had trouble believing the whole Hollywood star father. If he made so many schlock movies where did the Oscar come from? I saw almost every twist a mile down the road. Don't people in LA bolt the bookcases to the wall? I have enjoyed other books written in poem form, but these seem particularly shallow. The novel True Believe is especially good. Read this book if you must, but I think there are better ones that you would enjoy more."
2,Christina Bald's review,"In "" One of Those Hideous Books Where The Mother Dies."" There is a girl named Ruby who moved to LA,California. Her mother dies and she is forced to live with her father. She's upset because her aunt and uncle couldnt take her in. Ruby's father told her to come live with him. She left everything she'de ever known, ever loved. She finds out that her boyfriend Ray hooks up with her best friend Lizzy. Also that she has new problems, she begins to hate her mother for dying.I didnt really like this book because it doesnt really relate to me, in any way. Also, the way the book was written is very different than any other book I've ever read. This book didnt really want me to keep turning the pages, it made me want to shut it. The book sounded really good, just by the title and the front picture. Once I opened it, it wasnt as good as I thought it would have been. I didnt like this book also because comparing it to other book's I've read it just wasnt that interesting to me."
5,Amazing,"This book was amazing and shockingly cool, it gets a five out of five :DI think it's one of my favorites now."
4,Very nice,"I liked the easy way the story flowed, and the very interesting characters. I would have like a little more develing into characters, perhaps a view from different perspectives, and a less obvious ending, but it is a sweet and snappy read that I would recommend to girl in need of some laughs."
4,This book is good,"I think this was a really good book but it was a little creepy and sad. It is definetly geared for mid-teen audiences. I cried in the end, and so did my friend Karen. I read this book in a day because it was easy to stop, but not to put down. You should definetly read this!"
2,Mistitled book,"Unfortunately, the phrase ""Java Native Interfaces"" is in large letters and ""with SWT/JFace"" are in a much smaller font. It should have been the other way around because the complex subject of JNI is barely touched on here. I cannot comment on the SWT/JFace coverage because that was not my object, but if you are looking for a book that will tell you how to put C++ and Java code together, this one probably won't help."
5,New and Up to Date,"One thing you gotta love about the Java crowd is their naming philosophy. Now there is SWT, the Standard Widget Toolkit.This book covers SWT as used in conjunction with Eclipse. It first compares SWT with other user interface packages, then it goes on to detail how to use the widgets to facilitate the writing of GUI's. It's a tutorial style book that completely covers Version 3.0 of SWT/JFace in a clear and informative manner.This book is timely, clear and well written. It will quickly get the reader up to speed on these packages."
1,Beatle-Less,"Waste of time. I was expecting a Beatle Experience, instead I got duped. Absolute Lackluster."
5,Entertaining 101,"I am a great cook, but a so-so entertainer, usually focus on the food, and mess up on the execution part. I found this book so helpful for my particular growth area, that I went back and got four more to send as Christmas presents.I used to dread potlucks, not wanting to bring the same old dish. I get the notices and attention I crave when I prepare the gem of a shrimp recipe in which you display the shrimp on a half head of cabbage. Since reading this book, I have come far, presentation wise.... Every home library should have a good basic recipe book, and them complement it with a fun, useful guide like this one."
5,FIVE STARS IN ENTERTAINING TIPS,"Jeanne Benedict did a great job in giving ideas and tips on how to host a five star dinner party. I've used her ideas and they were simple projects that took little time and money. Jeanne is a class act, and I look forward to her next book."
1,Sophisticated Entertaining Gone Bad,I doubt the author has even made most of these recepies. If she had she might have noticed they don't work. We made the Goldschlager brownies twice. Tasted good and looked like crap. Entertaining recepies should have the look! Not willing to try more recepies. Will sell this book cheap. Any takers
5,Great!,"My mom had Corelle dishes when I was growing up, and they were dropped many times. They never broke! I love the fun pattern of these dishes and you can't beat the price! I will be buying a second set."
4,Great products for the price,"My mother in law, my sister in law and even my best friend use Corelle dinnerware. I don't care for the designs, so I did not want to buy them. However, having a preschooler and a young toddler who broke several of my stoneware plates made me realize that I probably should give Corelle a try. I bought 2 sets and they worked so well that I bought another 2 sets (so we have enough for dinner parties). I love how well they hold up and I love that they are so light that my kids can take their own dishes to the sink & clean up after themselves. The only thing I did not like was the the cups are made of stoneware, I wish they were made of the same materials as the plates. Although I don't love the designs on Corelle products, I found them acceptable. For the price and how durable they are, I am happy to use them in my home until my children are all grown."
3,"Delicate, moderately useful","The plates and bowls are thin and delicate china material , I wish they were sturdier. The mugs, however, are great; quite sturdy and very useful!The size of the larger plate is quite good, it can hold good amount of food. The smaller ones can be used only for serving small and light stuff like ice-cream/brownies but definitely not for a full sized cheesecake! The bowl is large enough for a morning oatmeal breakfast/soup but then again, for it to have been really useful, it should have been either slightly larger for accommodating fruits along with oatmeal & milk or smaller for serving sauce/curry.I find these moderately useful for everyday purposes. They do look good in the kitchen though. They hold up well in the microwave heat. The mugs don't get hot even after 2.5 minutes of heating.I don't know how many of you are colorblind out there but the mugs are coffee brown not black. The color looks great nevertheless!"
3,Bowls and cups do not match set,"The set doesn't seem to fully match in that the bowls and cups look to have come from a different set. The bowls have brown and yellow (70's color) stripes which match the cups well. But the bowls do not match the plates since the bowls have no blue tones. It looks like they made the plates and added the existing bowls and cups from another set. This is very disappointing.I have no issues with the quality (though I haven't used them yet). They are a bit thin, but they feel fine. No issues with broken dishes. Though I could see how the plates could be broken if the package was thrown around in an extreme manner.Oh, and dispite the product's name, this set is indeed round, not squared."
3,"I wanted to love them, I really did.","I thought this set was SO cute when I was looking at patterns. My first issue is that the small plates are VERY small. I guess I assumed they were more of a salad plate, because I had other sets where the smaller plates were big enough for that, but they are way too small. These are the perfect size for bread or a dessert. My second issue is that they are VERY thin. I feel like they are so fragile, I am almost scared to use them. My third issue is that they have stained already. I've only had them for a month, and they look like I've had them for 10 years. I have hand washed them and then placed them in the dishwasher to no avail. I do not microwave them either, so I can't really understand why they are stained like that already. The mugs are great.. if the plates and bowls could have been made out of the same material as the mugs, they'd be much better."
3,a bit dissapointed,"Corelle dishes are of excellent quality... my dissapointment deals with the fact that this set in particular comes with the smaller plates, both the cereal bowl and bread plate are very small. Make sure, when you look at the pictures that you notice the proportion between the small and the big plate, since other models have bigger bowls and bread plates. After buying and receiving these, I ended up buying other model with bigger bowls and bread plate.... Other than that, they are pretty and stylish."
2,NOT MICROWAVABLE!!!,"I got this set for my mother and she just received it today. The good news is that nothing was broken. BUT... it says Warning: not microwavable! I am very disappointed. Plus Corelle is suppose to be made in the USA, and this one says its made in China! I was expecting better from Amazon."
1,flimsy cheap and ugly.,"WOW. Amazon is getting GREAT at photoshop. This is not a quality dishware set. It is that old melamine stuff. Thin, cafeteria type material. I hate them."
3,Bored In Burmingham,One word discription BORING. I almost died but survived barely just to write a review. Don't give this book the time of day.
5,Not at all what I expected.,"This was entirely an impulse buy. I never even heard of tihs film until I saw it on this site and bought it immediately. Honestly, I just liked the cover. But when I watched it, I realized that I had purchased a gem that I was proud to have in my dvd collection."
4,B-Movie That deserves a remake,"This movie has been a summer party classic around my place for 12 years now. My wife really doesn't like B Movies, but stayed awake for this one. While it has flaws, I think that you can enjoy it in either an ironic way or as a true B Movie sci-fi/horror enthusiast. My advice for you to really enjoy it would be to fire up the grill on a hot July night, have a few beers with your friends and then, after the sun goes down and everyone is tipsy, throw this at them. Soon enough, they will understand. Then, repeat the procedure next year.Honestly, this is in my B Movie top 10. (Along with classics like The Giant Gila Monster and Killer Shrews. The back story is unique and the movie could be great if it was remade with a budget above the $16 they had to make this version."
5,Wonderful film! and wonderful version of it,I won't go into detail about how good the film is (which is a brilliant horror/comedy film) but the quality of the DVD. The image transfer is straight from the negative print which is very crisp. Previous editions (if you could find it) of this film were copied from a copied VHS tape. The extras are great if you are a big fan of the film.
4,a decent introduction to electroacoustic music,"this book has some very good aspects and some not-so-good ones; mainly, the chapters on computer music and MIDI production are swiftly going out of date, and there is no way to keep it updated without yearly appendices to the text itself. the book covers analog tape recording and splicing in good detail, especially for someone trying to do it on his/her own with no official teaching of it. pellman's listening guides are excellent as well."
3,Solid movie... If you enjoy silly musicals,I saw this movie in the theater with my wife who is a huge fan of rock n roll and the 80's so it was a match made in heaven for her! Thats why im buying it for her. It was very silly for me and a bit drawn out but enjoyable enough to not make it too annoying. Warning: do not expect any originality.
1,I just threw up in my mouth!,"I can't believe these A-list stars did this stupid musical. Yes, it's a musical about the 80's. They've taken the songs we loved from the greatest decade, and perverted them into a musical. I couldn't finish watching this would be movie. How do you take something so fun and ruin it? Just ignore this review and find out for yourself. I loved the 80's and all of the hair bands from this era. It's not the bands singing. It's the actors! A C T O R S!!!Not singers, that sing here. Be warned, the positive reviews here had to have been paid. There's just no other explaination..."
2,Very disappointed,"We were very excited to see this movie after all of the trailers. However, the plot was cheesy and underdeveloped and the music was made up of bad covers of classic rock anthems. That said, Tom Cruise was hilarious in the movie, but his role was much smaller than the previews would lead you to believe."
5,Great Movie!!,"Saw this in the theater and loved it. watched it at home w the other half, still loved it. Rent or buy you'll enjoy"
1,High School Musical for Adults,Cheesy... Lipsync city... poor acting by all but Baldwin.. Cruise has the strangest posture... Just horrible. A shame I wasted time and money on this.
3,Good songs with cheesy plot lines,Songs are good but acting and the plot is subpar at best with a storyline that is oddly connected together. You wont regret skipping this one.
1,Rock of ages,watched 1st 10 min. couldn't handle any more. if I would have known it a comedy musical i never would rented it
5,blast from the past,"Very surprising. Loved the singing. Bought the cd also and love it. The actors and actresses were excellent. What else can I say, it was definitely a blast from the past."
4,Better than I expected,I am not usually one to watch musicals. My wife really wanted to see this so we rented it and watched it.I was definitely impressed with the vocals. Tom Cruise really surprised me.The reviews I had seen were mediocre so I wasn't expecting much but I found myself laughing at the comedy and enjoying the plot. I came away entertained.
1,Poorly done,"I love musicals (theatre or movie), and had great hopes for this piece. What I found, instead, was an insipid bit of writing with mediocre acting (excepting Alec Baldwin). I was very disappointed."
4,"Love the music, love the movie.","This is the rock n' roll versior of Mama Mia. Great to hear the rock classics again in a totally different format, and, everyone commits especially Tommy Cruise who can sing!!!"
3,seemed like a rock version of Fame,"i was really excited about seeing it. but for the most part it was ho-hum. only the singing bits(and there were ALOT of them)Tom Cruise did were worth watching. did not care for the writhing in the church scene and the strippers needed better choreography. if there was a 1-10 rating i might give it a 7. glad i didnt buy it, afterall. thanks for the option to rent Amazon, you ROCK!!!!!"
3,It had it's moments,It had some very good moments and also some very corny moments with some horrible acting. The song selection was great and most of the actors sang them very well.
2,Rock of Ages,I thought the film was silly and the storyline lacked any form of character development. There seemed to be a lot of miscast actors.
3,So campy it's fun to watch -,"But don't think there's any real substance to it.Get together with your girlfriends, open up a big bottle of wine and sing along with all the songs we still know all the words to.But don't expect much more than that. It was fun, but that's about all."
4,Fun movie you'll be singing along to!,"If you like Glee or Rock Band-esque video games--or if you grew up listening to the great 80s hair bands--you will love this movie! It's cheesy, yes, and not going to win an Oscar or other esteemed award. But it's very fun and highly entertaining. Tom Cruise is hilarious. The song mash-ups are awesome as well. It's a great, lighthearted way to spend a couple of hours."
1,Not worth buying online,"I am usually a big fan of Tom Cruise, but I have to say this was not one of his better movies. I was impressed with his singing ability, but that was about the only thing worth watching. The music brought back some memories from my high school days, but still not worth the $4.99 I paid to watch online."
2,Hot Mess,What a train wreck. Bad acting and bad singing from start to finish. Cheesy Cheesy Cheesy all in a bad way.
3,not one of my top recommend movies,movie wasn't as good as the hype was. As a last resort movie i would watch it. dont waste your money.
3,rock of ages,i loved the 80's and this movie was all 80's. the plot even seemed to be a typical loose 80's plot. but the music made during that time was the best feel good rock!!!
1,Boring,Great soundtrack but the movie sucks. Too much of a musical for me to watch more than the first 20 minutes of.
1,Continuous Streaming Problem.,"HELP!I was unable to watch the movie in its entirety because it stopped streaming over and over again. The problem was evidently at the server location as I had no difficulty streaming HD movies from other providers. This problem happens almost every time I purchase a SD movie from Amazon.Com. Please consider refunding the charges, otherwise, cancel my account and refund the remaining balance."
1,dvd download,"Did not download and nobody got back to me and I will not pay for it again, will go without, also lost magic mike at the same time, that also didnt download and I also got charged for it!!!!"
1,Still waiting for a rock godot,"I love movies that risk it all, and this one seemed to have a lot of daring, inventive elements--at least in synopsis. But in practice it was a turgid, disappointingly formulaic movie (although it had a kind of winking, faux-naive tone that was obviously meant to excuse the dependence on tired narrative formulas)."
2,Just ok,"I loved all the stars in it and the humor, but I never really was super excited about it while watching."
3,Missed for me.,"I should have liked this movie. I liked Mama Mia and I like watching Glee but for some reason this one fell flat for me. I think it's because I thought the plot was a little corny. I did however love the 80's music. It brought back tons of memories from my youth. It was everything in between that bored me. If you like musicals, it's worth a shot."
1,Probably the worst movie I've ever watched.,Amazing what a weak director can do to talented actors. Truly brought out the worst. I wouldn't have watched this for free if I had a clue as to how bad it was. Since I paid for it I watched it to the end hoping for better but there was none to be had.
1,Horrible,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. A complete waste of time and money. So corny, hokey and stupid."
2,Not worth $,Good music and singing but not worth full attention or money. Wish I had borrowed and played in the background while trimming my toenails
2,Meh.,Not worth the rental. Took out all the amusing and good parts from the original musical and left a mediocre shell.
1,the good music elevates this movie to 1 star,the music is great; tom cruise was funny. the movie itself was not worth the price. overall download was easy.
4,Rock musical lovers must see,"I was in love the moment i relized everyone was actualy singing the songs! Tom cruize rocked, aleick baldwin was great as always and the guy who stared in the film has a awesome voice and looks better and better as the movie goes . But it also has a comedy feel too!"
4,nostalgic,"I had been dying to see this movie, and it did make me feel nostalgic, as I was in college during this time. Russell Brand is especially funny, but the ending's a bit corny."
4,musical........,musical........Rock of AgesJulianne Hough...tom cruise is so funny alec baldwin is great... cornball but entertaining...I like it enough to buy it
3,Struggles for a Story Line,"The movie features some classic rock music from the '80s. However, it seems to really have a hard time finding a good story line. This seems to be primarily a vehicle to showcase the music.Tom Cruise does a decent job in playing his character. Not bad in his singing either.Worth a watch if you are not expecting too much."
5,80's kids this is for you.,"A fun musical that revisits all the great songs from the big hair bands and the styles from back in the day. Terrific performances from Cruise, Baldwin, Crowe and Hough with many others."
4,Good movie,"Was actually a pretty good movie, plot and music wise. Good for an at home or rental for a date."
2,could have been better!,"I though this movie could have been better. I don't know why i expected so much from it but, i did and now im disapointed."
1,Terrible,"This was one of the worst movies I have seen this year. Tom Cruise was excellent in it, and he was the most enjoyable part of it all. Other than that, I couldn't believe what I was watching and that someone actually green lit this film. Horrible! I would definitely not recommend, even if it's free."
3,It was ok...,"It was just ok. I grew up listening to -and loving - every song in this movie (in the 80's, when they came out!), and that was why I wanted to see it. I wanted to like it more than I did. I was surprised at Tom Cruise actually being a pretty good singer, but his acting in this was AWFUL. He moved like he was very uncomfortable with every single move. Totally stupid plot, but that's fine, to be expected - it was made for the love of the songs, not the plot! Drew (Diego) was really good, probably the best as far as singing goes in the film. Glad I watched it, but not something I'll ever want to watch again. *sigh*"
2,"Love the music, but...","Maybe it's Hollywood. Maybe it's the glitz of film musicals. Maybe it's Tom Cruise. Whatever the 'it' is, I quit looking at it 2/3 through. There are people who love to see musicals in the cinema. There are people who don't. I am in the latter group. On stage and live makes musical theater, musical theater. (The only musical I ever enjoyed on film was The King and I.) Hollywood is too slick. The people are too pretty. And far too often their personalities overwhelm characters they portray. I wasn't looking at the character Brand was supposed to be, I was looking at Russell Brand. He acted like the Russell Brand I see when David Letterman interviews him. Who was Brand in the film anyway?Why did I watch? I love the music. Just close your eyes and listen. I did."
2,"No plot, bad acting.","We really wanted to see this in the theater, but it was pulled before we got a chance. It came to video pretty quickly, so we decided to rent it. We had high hopes. They were crushed. We liked it for the music, but the acting was horrible. The plot is non-existant.So instead of wasting your time on the movie, just buy the soundtrack."
1,The Worst Movie Ever Made?,"Horrible! Misogynistic! Terrible, terrible writing, god-awful acting except for Tom Cruise. He was wonderful. A delight to watch and to hear sing. He's the only one worth seeing in this movie. The absolute worst."
1,Not what I expected.,All I will say is if that was Tom really singing he has a great voice. The movie was horrible in my opinion. I hate Musicals.
1,wasted $4.99,"Awful, awful, awful. Love that era and the music but this was not watchable. I was in my early 20's during this period and I can say there was not 1 realistic moment in this movie."
1,Disappointing,"Even the lip syncing was off. Not worth the time, much less the money. Should have, could have been a fun classic."
1,A New Low,"This is the last nail in the coffin of rock and roll. It is a conglomeration of rock and roll cliches that were overpublicized to begin with, and in this film, they are pushed beyond the outer limits of parody. It's just weird. The younger generation doesn't understand rock and roll. This is more like the spangled glitz of Xanadu."
1,loved the play,"hated the lip-synced, badly acted, changed plot, that was this movie. What a waste. Russell was bad. Tom C was in a stupor. Good music didn't make it to the screen. This review is more effort than this one deserved."
3,It's ok,If i'd have seen this movie before buying it i wouldn't have bought it. The best parts were the parts in which Russell Brand appeared.
2,Doesn't live up to the hype.,"Very disappointed in this movie. Storyline was dull, acting mediocre at best.A waste of Tom Cruise' talents. I was at the very least hoping for good music, but that did not happen either."
2,Rock of Ages,"Funny movie, but was not impressed. good for mindless entertainment only. Would not recommend unless there was nothing better to do."
2,"I love musicals, just not this one","This musical did not hold my attention. The performances were great, the story was lousy, and the mix of the two just left me feeling ambivalent."
2,"IN THE "" WHAT WERE THEY THINKING"" CATAGORY....","Yes, Tom C. and what music there is would be the only reason to buy this movie atrocity of the Broadway hit. In fact, the cast was very good except for Diego Boneta (a major casting error). Boneta was so weak that he couldn't hold up his part to the standard of the heavy-weights around him (including the monkey). Too bad they were all fighting a losing battle as the story, fun, structure, and music were gutted and mutated so far from the original and in the worst way. Adam Shankman proves that he is an egotistical no talent hack (and honestly that is being overly kind). It drives me crazy that this movie insult even exists as it is extremely doubtful that a decent version will ever be made. For a real good time see the live show, apparently Shankman didn't."
1,"horrible, pass on rock of ages","bad movie, tom cruise was awesome though. the lead-female was not very good. the British actor (katy p's X) dog crap."
3,review of DVD Rock of Ages,"At first, my DVD I received would not play, it kept saying disc error, I tried it on both DVD players in my house, and wouldn't work in either one, I had a friend of mine take it home, and it did not work for her either. Her daughter took the DVD and cleaned it really well with a dry cloth and then she was able to watch it. She gave it back to me, and then it worked for me also, can't figure out why this would not work straight from the package, I thought I would be returning it, but glad we got it to work."
3,Aged Rock,"Silly story, Great songs. Not much character building. Be prepared to laugh and enjoy the ridiculousness of it all. One more word - Don't expect much"
3,Just look for the Cruise.,"This is a musical, in case you didn't know. It's not as good as you probably thought it was going to be and that comes from the top-to-bottom demograohic they are trying to appeal to in the casting. The very weak part, depending on your age, I guess, is the two younger male and female leads. They are nice people, but just too bland to push anything at you from the screen. I really doubt 12 year olds were flocking to see this movie, so I doubt they made any extra money by placing these two so centrally. And it certainly did bring down the movie's critical ratings. Tom Cruise is the one you are going to be waiting for between lapses in his screen time. He leaves nothing left ungiven as usual. The one other detail that detracts from the fillm is the lipsync singing which sometimes works and sometimes flops. Zeta-Jones is good with the dance moves."
4,Rock of Ages,Really enjoyed this musical. Do not normally like musicals but this one is of my era music and loved it.
2,Ugh,"Only 2 reasons to see it, if any: Baldwin & Cruise. The rest -- zip. Hangs together only cause it's all put in one movie."
3,"HD movie kept cutting off while watching it on Kindle Fire HD, but loved the movie","Well, I missed the ending because I rented the movie on my new Kindle HD. I love the movie though as it had a ton of 80's music in it which I love! The acting was really good and I loved seeing Tom Cruise in this role! I highly recommend renting it but not sure about in HD!"
4,Awesome movie for an eighties child...,The song selection and performance were top notch. I didn't know Tom Cruise could sing! This movie is definitely going to move into my top ten.
2,More Foreigner! (Sarcasm),"Let's take a Broadway show, which already features too much Foreigner (and I love foreigner), and turn it into a movie in which main stream actors do terrible jobs at lip-syncing. And stop ruining Foreigner!"
1,"hated it,","this was very stupid movie. I wouldn't waste my time. We eventually turned it off. Was star packed, but dumb."
1,like Rock and Roll Nightmare,"One of the worst films I have ever seen. Which was really surprising given the great cast this film had. I've seen most of these performers in much better roles (movies with half decent stories even). I hate to say this- but it is a truly awful film. I can't help but wonder who the target audience is, Let's recap- Juvenile sexual scenarios? check. Poor renditions of tired, soppy 80's radio tunes? check. Paper thin characters who aren't even allowed to be 1/10th as funny as they have been in their other films? check.It was just not entertaining at all- no redeeming value in the story, performances or even the music. A period piece with this cast should have been great- but this was just a missed opportunity. Sad."
1,Lame...,"Well...it's not what I thought it would be. I thought the entire thing was a joke. I wasn't expecting a serious movie, but I wasn't expecting what I got either. I thought this film wasted a lot of talent from the cast and I really think it was poorly done. Kind of sad that I wasted $4 renting it..."
4,Funny weird,At 18 in '87 the music was a trip down memory lane. So was the hair and clothes LOL. Have fun!
2,Ugh,The music was the ONLY reason I made it just over halfway through. It was so bad I couldn't finish it. The memories of the music just couldn't get me through.
2,rock of ages...ok,it was ok. expected more. i liked the songs/music best. it seemed to drag on too long. the theme has been done before....over & over.
3,cute musical,The movie was fun. The music and dancing were good. Anyone who likes rock can enjoy this movie. the end
4,For a musical...,"I was REALLY looking forward to this movie, then heard friends say ""it's a little much, even for a musical"" so I kept putting it off. I'm so glad I finally got around to it renting it. Julianne Hough is so damn cute, and all the stars delivered! The cameo's were great, and as much as I think Tom Cruise is a puke, he really REALLY did a great job!"
3,"Good performances, 3-1/2 stars","My husband liked it quite well. I was impressed at the actors doing their own singing. All I knew of the movie was from the trailer, which had looked cute, and I didn't even know it was based on a Broadway musical. If I had known, I would have ignored it, because I don't like musicals generally; that's why the relatively low rating. That said, this one chose pretty good 80's music, and the performances are energetic. There are quite a few special features on this Blu-ray (single disc), and it does come with an online copy. The special features include comments from band members of the groups that made the songs popular, about the writing and their reaction to these performances; one on 80's hair-styles (!), and 80's clothing. There are some comments from the actors, minus Tom Cruise."
3,Forgettable,Amusing but forgettable. It had a very predictable plot. I fell asleep half way through the movie and didn't miss anything.
3,Music lover,I enjoyed this movie in the theater and especially enjoyed the musicality. That is why I wanted to have it in my video library.
1,Painful to Watch,"I had high hopes for this movie from watching it previewed for what seemed like forever. OMG, it was like watching an old, has-been lecherous dude act like a horny teenager...and not in a funny or entertaining way, either. It was painful watching Tom stick his tongue down the mouths of every young woman in the movie. I wanted to puke. I wish I could give it zero stars. Sadly, I spent my hard-earned money to see this at the theater. Let this be a warning: SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy yourself something fun instead of wasting it on this horror of a flick. I only wish someone had warned me."
2,Death of Rock,"As someone who grew up the Eighties, Who lived that music, saw many of those bands play live, and had every one of those albums the day they came out, I have to say this movie pretty much just took a dump on everything that music represents for me. What the heck? Those songs were one of a kind originals, performances by artists that are not meant for a musical. They are Rock and Roll songs, music with Balls and raw passion, not Broadway songs to be performed with that sterility, by actors and then overmixed. Gah!!! Gah!!! The only good line: ""I just threw up. In my pants. Out of my ass."""
5,rock of ages,"Love it , can't wait for dvd!Tom Cruise great job. The Grease of the 80's. Great job Hey Man."
1,This movie SUCKS. I want a refund!,Amazon should give you a refund if you hate a movie within the first 30 minutes.I hated this movie in the first 10 minutes. The lead female has the most annoyingvoice I have ever heard. I can't listen no mo. And the cinematography is awful!looks like it was shot on 16mm or something. I can see it working on stage asa musical but it doesn't work on the screen. Don't waste your time. Wait till itis free on netflix. Maybe it would be good to watch while vacuuming the rug.
5,Good,"This is terrific but I may have to order another one for he grandkids so I can have mine back! Nastalgia for me, new for them"
3,Great classic rock music,Move has a wonderful sound track of old classic Rock. Acting was very good plot was ok. You must like Musicals and classic rock to enjoy this Movie. Tom Cruise did very well portraying his part but really went over board on the Zoned out persona.They also coud have left out a gay montage which would have made the movie better.Excellent singing.
3,Entertaining,"Good way to spend an evening, music well placed. Tom Cruise as always, does his great job. Entire cast great!"
5,Rock of Ages,Rock of Ages was a Christmas gift my daughter requested for Christmas because she saw it before and really loved it.
4,"Funny movie, good 80's music.",This was a gift as my daughter who loved the music and thought it was funny plus all the great actors being silly.
3,"Good songs, Tom is a flop",Julianne does a great job and the movie has great songs. Wasn't impressed with Tom Cruise's character or singing. Decent movie .
3,A time killer..,"Well if you are into the 80s glam metal secen, then this is for you..If you need to kill a few hours then this is one of those movies.."
2,"good music, bad acting, predictable",Disappointing for such a great cast and music. Appeared to be a parody but wasn't. The story was predictable other than the unexpected relationship that the bar owners ended up in at the end.
3,Did he just sing into her butt?,"I am trying to view this a second time before my rental expires, but am having a hard time. I love cheesy stuff but this is artery-blocking cheese of the highest magnitude. I am having a hard time telling the two blonde chicks apart, and the scene where Tom Cruise is singing to one of the blondes and starts singing into her granny panties, I just doubled over with laughter and had to pause it for quite awhile. Ok one blonde has a perm and abs, and the other has less curly hair and abs.Though I have to say the 1980's classics do bring a smile to my face, even though most of them are wrecked by the stars in this flick.The thing I liked best about this movie, and I don't think it's too spoilery, is the fact they savaged the dancing goofball boy band dudes.The romance between Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin is a bit out of place in this period piece, but it does show the kids gay people existed before the 19990's.Rock of ages? I'd say rent Rock of Ages, don't buy."
1,Possibly the worst movie ever,"This movie is ridiculous. The lip syncing is completely off timing, the way they break out into song at the most random times is awkward and completely cheesy, and Zeta-Jones' acting is horrendous. I couldn't even finish watching this movie. Glad I only paid $3.99 for it."
2,Oh brother,"Formulaic and poorly acted. Cruise is OK, Baldwin is atrocious. Brand should go back to doing voiceovers for cartoons. Lot's of other musicals that satisfy, but this one? Not so much."
3,Was just ok,This was just ok. I would not pay to watch this movie again and I wish I wouldn't have paid for it the first time!
1,Hate it!!!!!,Don't waste your money or your time on this!Wish I could have those 2 hours back (they can keep the money!!!_
1,"GREASE, it is not","For a musical to succeed you need at least two ingredients : good music and good choreography.You see a better choreography in a mediocre Bollywood than in this film.Music is ok but the cast is very bad. They have cast a bimbo with a vulgar voice as the heroine. Whenever she starts to sing, you want to shout : STFU.Cruise does some of the most the unlaughable stints in this film."
3,It's ok,It isn't a bad movie. It isn't a good movie either. I suggest waiting until it hits Amazon Prime then watch it for free.
2,Cheesy,Extremely cheesy movie. Didn't make it through the first hour. I just turned it off and watched a rerun of something else.
4,"Weak story, but great for 80s music fans!","Rock of Ages is a musical based around a simple story of two young people and their dreams of becoming rock and roll singers. They meet, fall in love, and work at a troubled rock bar called The Bourbon. Tom Cruise plays the older rock star, Stacy Jaxx, who is breaking off from his original band and plays at the Bourbon, interacting with the other characters.Overall the movie was fun to watch, with all of the actors impressively singing their parts. All of the songs are familiar to those of us who grew up in the 80's, and it's quite fun to listen to the new interpretations and scenes.Ultimately a weak, cliched story, but the music made it quite enjoyable."
1,WARNING it's Rockstar GLEE,"Not what I expected...I muted most of the corny music numbers. Just couldn't take it.Tom Cruise has a couple funny spots, otherwise I'd like a refund. Anyway just not for me."
4,Rock of Ages,Loved this movie. Tongue-in-cheek view of the eighties rock scene. Tom Cruise can really sing! Highly recommend if you like rock music.
2,Not one of Tom Cruises better movies,"This i think must be one of Tom Cruises biggest blunders in show business, could hardly understand what he was saying in fact i did not even finish watching it, i might one day but not any time soon. I hope his new movie Jack Reacher is better if not he better step up his game, after all he cant get buy on his good looks forever."
3,Rock of Ages,"I choose a three star movie because I liked the stars that were in the movie, but the story line was too familiar. The music was great."
1,Awful,Some actors should not sing. They are bad at it. I am embarrassed for them that they even tried. We watched the first 20 or 25 minutes and turned it off.
1,80's are fun but this movie isn't,"Acting was insipid, stars mailed in their performance, the two young leads were equally awful (though the girl could sing). Pass on it."
1,Not so much,Not so much. Cheesy. Very predictable. I would not watch it again. Close to an 80 movie. Not for me
1,Not good,I usually dont mind musicals but I couldnt get through this one. I would not recommend this movie. There are better movies out there.
1,Rock of Ages,"Saw the Broadway production, so probably shouldn't have watched this. If you haven't seen the live version, you'd probably like this. Music is still great."
1,Can I get my $3.99 back??,"I was so excited to watch this movie, and after reading the reviews decided I would rent it. HUGE disappointment. Not funny, not engaging, characters are bland, storyline is drawn out and boring. The only thing I liked was the music, but I could listen to that without having to put up with 2 hours of disinteresting movie in between. I'm sorry to say, but skip this one!"
1,Not what I thought it was going to be,"This movie is horrible. The bad acting, singing, and the fact that it tries to be a musical make this a huge disappointment of a movie. Both my wife and I hated it. Not sure what all the hype was about but this movie was not worth my time."
3,Not what I expected,"I was super excited about this movie - looked like a new, fun-er, star-studded version of Almost Famous... but its not - its a musical!! Which would've been fine, had I been prepared for that... It was fun and good enough, but not amazing and a musical - as in, break out in song during a tough situation musical...."
3,GF liked it much more than I did,"This was more of a chick-flick than I expected. I can respect/enjoy a good chick-flick, but this one wasn't even that good. I was pretty bored throughout the movie. The music is ok, and a few of the actors perform well, but overall I wouldn't recommend this unless you're really desperate for a popcorn flick."
2,not that good of movie,it just was not a good story! probably not good for the young people to see! probably not good role models in the movie!
1,Not worth the time,"Couple of funny moments, but that was it. Be prepared, it is a musical, in the spirit of High School Musical."
2,Rock of Ages,Movie had poor acting and I was not expecting all the singing. Just not what I expected. This is definitely a rent or free movie.
1,Flop of ages,"This movie is terrible. In a cast of stars and studs, the story follows two of the worst actors I've ever seen. The girl can sing but can't act. The guy can't sing and can't act. Don't ever watch."
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!,"This movie is fantastic. Not a cheesy musical like I thought it would be! Loved the actors and the music. Although I highly recommend this movie, it should not be seen by children..."
1,rock of ages,it was to loud and could not hear them when they talked. i wished i had not brought the movie.
2,Rock of Ages,"The movie was enjoyable so I sent a copy to my sister and it didn't play on her DVD player. So it had to be returned for another which also didn't play on her DVD, but did play on her son's X-Box. Can't recall, but didn't notice in the description what Ultraviolet (think that's it) really was. It was a bummer."
5,Yeah musicals!,Yes I love musicals and I was really surprised by the performances that came out of this one. They were good. I grew up in the 80's so it brought back a lot of memories. Even my 16yr old son got into it. He likes music and he appreciated this. Lot's of singing along feel good scenes.
4,You've got to get past the beginning,"At the start, I was like OMG I rented this? I looked forward to and rented this?! Honestly, for probably about the first 20 minutes I felt that way. I even took a break and came back to it. I was a teen in the 80's and I'm going to guess we're the ones who are liking this movie the most. It has that sort of corny, of-its-own-era feel to it that was similar to the styles of films back then. I didn't get that at first... but slowly my mind and cares drifted away and I began to enjoy. They could have gotten stronger leads, that's for SURE. Their voices aren't great and Juliann should stick to dancing, sorry. TOM CRUISE made this whole movie for me. Without his character (and getting to see him in this role - wasn't a fan until recently), I think it would have all fallen apart. It's likely going to be one of those you love it or hate it movies. I may watch it again to watch Tom. Sexy as hell in this!"
5,Tom Cruise shows a bawdy and funny side,"this movie didn't get the best reviews at the theatres -they were really wrong - it is really hilarious with Tom, Alec and Russell. Too funny. Also the music was great - Tom can really sing, what a surprise. Catherine Zeta-Jones was a great surprise with her singing and dancing. Loved it all."
4,entertaining,"If you love musicals and 80's rock, you'll enjoy this movie. The story was typical, but it was still fun to watch. I was hesitant when I found out Tom Cruise would be playing a rock star, but I have to give him props for playing someone totally out of his character."
4,A nice trip back...,"For those of us who remember...or who might NOT want to remember..., this movie was exactly was what it was meant to be. A look back at some and the worst music of the mid-80s. The cameos were great too. Sebastian Bach..showing his face many times as usual. LOL Anyway, if you want it to be a serious movie, forget it! If you want a satirical, musical romp through the good ol' days, then this movie is for you! Surprisingly, Tom Cruise can sing....a little. His version of what he sang of ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" was just right. Mostly the audience sang it, sorry about the spoiler, but it was fun anyway! So sit back, put on your leg warmers and spandex and ROCK OUT!!!"
5,great musical,"This was a fun movie to watch.. I enjoyed the soundtrack and caught myself singing along a few times. If you like classic rock, you will enjoy this."
5,:),absolutyly love this movie! more of a musical which I love..so if you dont like music itsnot for you. love and music=amazing!
4,great sound track,the story line was a little predictable but the actors did a great job with the characters and the sound track is awesome
2,Wanted more,"Three idea behind this movie is unoriginal but I had an open mind. Unfortunately the trailer picked out the only good scenes. The remainder of the movie was mindless, predictable, uninspired and too obviously fake. There were too many elements and not enough substance. Overall, just disappointing."
1,Make it stop..,"The TV show Glee meets Rock n Roll. And it ain't pretty. Take some popular songs and mangle them. That's pretty much the premise.I was going to give it 2 Stars for Paul Giamatti, but then I remembered seeing Sebastian Bach and Nuno Bettancourt in one scene, and thatirked me, so one star."
1,Blindsided,"Only watched the first 10-15 minutes. It quickly became apparent that this is not the type of ""entertainment"" my wife and I care to watch. Wish I could un-see the image of Tom Cruise's buttocks filling the screen. I was looking forward to this show from the positive comments I had heard about the sound-track. Unfortunately, some of the characters portrayed (at least in the first few minutes) were totally debased. I did not want them in my living-room. Only wish there was some way to get my money back."
1,"Great music, stupid movie",Really lame movie. Great music is the only reason I watched it as long as I did. Don't waste your money.
1,Wow. Don't torture yourself,"Okay - so, I saw this show on Broadway and it was absolutely amazing. Great cast, great energy and a really enjoyable night.This movie is none of those things. Terrible cast, dreadfully boring and ridiculously cheesy. Don't do it. You'll never get back that time of your life."
3,Not what we expected,We rented this movie through Amazon and I'm glad I didn't pay full price to see this in a movie theatre. I usually like a musical but this was rather hokey. Not what we expected at all. We did watch the whole movie but would not recommend it.
2,Wait till it goes on Netflix or HBO,"It's a musical, what else needs to be said Someone should have told Tom Cruise he was in a movie lol"
1,ackkkkkkkk,bbbbbaaaaarf barfed yacked tossed cookies sharted.... ohh my virgin ears. not a good movie and that is about it. wont recommend or watch again
2,Stupid movie,"This was a stupid movie. Wish I had known it was like ""Glee"" before I watched it. Just a stupid, stupid movie."
2,Disappointed,"Im glad I just rented this movie. Was not impressed. Tom Cruise, probably one of the biggest movie flops he could have starred in. I only watched the whole thing because I spent money to rent it."
3,Crap story; Epic soundtrack,"This movie belongs in the garbage... however, it's saving grace is an absolutely PHENOMENAL soundtrack. The creativity and arrangements of some of the 80's best songs brings the movie to life. Definitely worth watching at least once. We're not gonna take it / We built this city says it all :-)"
5,Kitschy,Love Alec Baldwin...he is hysterical. Tom Cruise is a flake...but admittedly very talented. This movie was very entertaining...it made me laugh because I remember being young and dumb. This movie appeals to my era I suspect (big hair and spandex). Don't expect Academy Award quality. Cheezy musical. Loved it!
1,Awful,"It made us feel embarrassed for the actors. We were hoping it would be the good kind of bad, maybe campy, but it's not. It's boring and not entertaining in any way."
2,Rock of Ages got lost in the pages,"We had seen the stage show and felt it was outrageously wonderful.The music was from our era we rocked the night away and the story line was cool.So we were really excited to see how it would be captured on film.The music was there but the magic and spark was gone. I am not a hugh fan of Tom Cruise but I think he was ok with his part but some of my favorite actors were in this but, they just seemed to be miscast and just muddled thru it. There were one or two little segments that were a bit fun and that is why I gave it two stars instead one. We really wanted to enjoy the big guns of this movie but all it did for us was to shoot blanks"
1,D-,"Terrible film. The set pieces were the only thing that was at all moving. There were slight hints of nostalgia and novelty from various song choices, but the cues for the songs, the dialog, and the plot timing was so overwhelmingly whack that I can't believe I paid real, actual money for this. It was my girlfriend's choice. Even she regrets it."
4,Good,Have never seen the broadway musical but I enjoyed the movie. The songs were great and Tom Cruise was perfect in the role of the aging rocker. Am not a big fan of Tom Cruise but he has made some good movies and he certainly showed his diversity in this one!! Even if you are not from the 80's and can overlook some of the more raunchy scenes the movie can be a fun watch.
3,How fun was that!,"That was fun having been a teen in the 80's. Wanted to force my kids to watch it. Between this, Dazed and Confused, and Fast Times at Ridgemont High the 70/80 generation is documented for history."
4,movie review,Love the movie its supper funny and on with the times love all the actors and all the music its a blast for all
5,Feel like I was at the theatre,"If you have ever seen it on broadway its just as great on screen. I felt the passion, the comedy and the music. Tom cruise impressed me with the performances. Lots if big stars and they do it justice ad normally movies with too much star power in my opinion are so over loaded the you aren't able to catch on. One to own for sure."
3,good soundtrack. not a great film,the soundtrack and the nostalgia of the music was well done. some strong musical performances but the plot and acting was lacking
2,Nowhere near as good as broadway,"While this does have some rockin' licks it just doesn't stack up against the original. For whatever reason, big budget names never seem to have the power that a live production can deliver. It'll do in a pinch, but go see it on stage, you'll thank me for it."
2,Why?,Tom C. did a nice job... only positive thing i can say. I would not suggest this to anyone ever.
2,Rock of Ages,Cheesy movie. Only the music was good everything else was cheesy. Could only sit through the first 10 minutes then gave up.
2,Cruz is no Travolta,Julianne was wonderful ... the rest were SO fake that it was funny. Loved the music from my era ... listened to the movie but did not watch.
2,Poor sound,Movie was great...coulda been greater if the sound was better. I had the volume at max but had to lean in to hear the dialog. Seems to happen frequently with amazon video. You folks need to fix this.
4,80's Magic,This movie really holds the essence of the 80's. And the magic of the sunset strip and rock n roll. And the cheesyness of the 80's. This one will get stuck in your head. And Tom Cruise was actually cool in this movie.
2,Awkward.,I can see that this is probably an entertaining on stage presentation. It just didn't translate well into motion picture. I'm still apologizing to my husband for picking this movie.
1,shut it off half way through,Just a big confusing mess on oddly places 80's music. I felt bad for the songs and original singers. Don't watch this until you have finished watching all other movies.
1,Can't hear the dialog.,"When I played the DVD, the music played fine. But when there was supposed to be dialog or solos, there was nothing. All previous DVDs on that player that day played fine. This DVD was crap. There is only one in the box so that must be the ""digital copy"". I want my money back."
1,1 star is too much,I didn't make it 10 minutes and I had to stop. Pure agony. You have been warned. SERIOUSLY - if you like torture - then this is for you.
1,Glee trying to be rock.,"Terrible destruction of awesome music. This was the gayest, most boring excuse for a rock movie ever. Tom Cruise should be ashamed of himself, as should the artists that allowed their songs to be butchered in such a manner."
1,Sometimes you have to take a role to make money,I am not sure if I was crying last night from being emotionally unstable or Rock of Ages was just that bad. If I was Katie Holmes I would leave Tom Cruise too after his lead role in the movie. I gave the movie 1 star because I like the songs and big permed hair!
1,One of the worst movies I've seen in the last 5 years.,I saw the musical and it was fantastic. The big screen adaptation is one big horrible comedy starting with the opening bus scene.A complete train wreck.
1,Pain,Just plain awful! Don't bother wasting your time. We couldn't even make it 30 minutes into movie. I seriously wouldn't trust anyone who likes this movie!!!
1,AWFUL,"The story line and acting was so poor it was painful to watch. Wanted to see it through to the end, but never thought it would end. I like some musicals but hope they do not make more like that one."
1,Horrible Movie,"It's no wonder this movie didn't last long in the theater, it's just plain horrible. I actually turned it off and I paid for the rental!!"
1,Not sure.,Don't even know if I should rate this movie because I couldn't even get past the first 10 minutes of the movie. The part I saw I thought was extrememly cheesy.
1,it sucks,Terrible musical. Not at all what you would expect. Don't sit through this crappy movie. Really really bad acting. Could not bear to finish this.
1,Rock of Ages,"worst movie I have ever seen. Highly recommend NOT TO WATCH IT. Tom Cruise was pathetic, the premise was worse."
1,Disappointment,Very disappointed with this product. They make it seem like it is a full size movie poster but it is not much bigger than a sheet of paper.
1,Rock of Ages Review....AWFUL,"Horrible and torcher to sit through. And, oh by the way, it should not have a PG-13 rating. Watched with our son and was horrified at some of the content for a young man...no wonder we have problems in this world!!!"
1,Rock of ages,"Nice try for the return of the musical...but this movie was more irritating than anything else. I wanted to like it, I'm a rock fan, but the characters couldn't pull it off."
1,SYTYCD + Glee = terrible movie,"Great concept for a movie, but the plot gets 1/5 and the songs, which I generally liked, had that awful canned sound that one encounters in so many terrible TV shows(i.e. Glee) It's ironic to me in that if you are from the group of people who actually liked the music in its heyday (poison, def leppard) I'd find it hard to believe you like the genre of work spawned from those involved in the creation of this movie (Mia Michaels, Adam Shankman, etc) and thus the movie itself."
1,Rock of Ages - Very Bad,"Even though the movie had big name actors, it was horrendous. The acting was terrible, the dialogue pitiful and the story-line just pathetic. A pure waste of money."
1,Couldn't get through it.....,"The first ten minutes were painful, but I endured through 20, just for the sake of giving it a chance. I had to shut it off, just couldn't do it. It was that bad. And I like 80's music, by the way."
4,Really fun!!,"Well, I think it was a blast! The songs were great! The actors really fit their parts! The only downfall was it was a bit drawn out - could have ended it about 20 minutes earlier for a really awesome length movie (for what it was intended to be). Clearly, this movie is for those who want entertainment - NOT a thinking movie or something other than pure fun! I really enjoyed it! B+ at least! If you love the 80s and rock-n-roll, you'll love it :)Great fun, Tom Cruise, Russell Brand, Alec Baldwin - hilarious!"
2,Why I don't like Los Angeles,What can I really say about a movie that didn't hold my interest and was sort of boring to boot?
3,Just OK - Synch it up!,"Movie was OK. I was expecting more based on the energy of the preview. The singing didn't seem very well synched, I even started the movie over a few times in the event there was a problem with the signal. That fact alone cheapened the experience for me and tainted my rating."
3,GOOD SONGS,ALL THE ACTORS WERE VERY GOOD BUT THEY OVERDID IT WITH TOM CRUISE'S PART--THIS WAS PRIME TIME OF LIFE FOR ME & THERE WERE NO ROCK STARS ANYWHERE NEAR THIS CONCEITED--THEY HAD TOO MUCH MAKEUP ON HIM TOO
2,Glorified Karaoke,"Rock of Ages has its heart in the right place, but not its soundtrack.Growing up on '80s rock such as Poison, Twisted Sister, and Bon Jovi, I'm hesitant to hear my favorite songs sung by actors or anyone else other than the original singer(s). The cast is competent, but it feels like karaoke night.The more disappointing aspect is the lack of cameos from the real rock stars that built the foundation for this film and provided the music."
2,Mildly entertaining,"Tom Cruise fun to see, rest pretty pathetic. Would not spend money on, save for a flight :-) hope that helps"
2,Good music but stupid movie,The only good thing about this movie was the music which definately took me back to some fun times! Tom Cruise so over-acted in this movie that is was almost comical. The direction of the Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand characters was confusing and just not necessary. This movie could have been so much better.
5,great movie,very entertaining. The music really brought back memories. would reccommend this to anyone. I hope I can find more current movies like this on Amazon
4,"what a fun musical with lots of laughs, tears and happiness","i really love this musical. Before watching it, I had no idea it orginally was a broadway musical. the songs are awesome! i was born in the late 80's and wished i could have experienced the early to late 80's even early 90's music. diego boneta blew me away and so did julianne hough. my favorite numbers are anyway you want it, don't stop believing and wanted dead or alive."
3,Problems with the instant player,"I love this movie but, the Amazon Instant Player does not love me. I had to restart it three times for the connection to be right and it still didn't work if you're trying watch it on your computer connected to a projector or TV."
1,Waste of money,"Although Tom Cruise's singing was a pleasant surprise, the rest of the movie was predictable, trite, and boring. Don't waste your money. The plot line was almost identical to Coyote Ugly. I can see why it flopped at the movie theaters."
1,Cliched Story Poor Acting,The story is corny and predictable. Acting doesn't rise up beyond the material except for Tom Cruise who takes his best stab at Axel Rose. Alec Baldwin is funny solely because he seems to know what a mess it is and doesn't take it too seriously. the soundtrack mashes together a bunch of songs that only makes them seem sappy. Avoid.
3,Not the powerhouse movie I thought it would be,"Enjoyed the music but the movie itself was a little cheesy. Not sure if that was the intent, but it was still ok.There were some funny moments in it, which seemed to erase the slowness of the movie. Tom Cruise did a great job of portraying an ""out-of-it"" rock star. His character was the most intense of all of them, even though he spoke in a low, mumbling voice."
3,Egh...,"I could've gone without seeing this movie; although, Tom Cruise does put on a really good performance. If you're into 80's music, then you'll probably like it. I, myself, only like a few songs from the 80's."
2,Great music,Not so great story line but really great music... Enjoyed it to a degree. Good enough to watch once but no more than that.
1,One of the WORST movies ever seen,"This movie did not advertise as just a musical. It is...and a horrible one at that. While the songs are good (from the 80's) the performances are just plain hokey. Tom Cruise's role, which was probably hoping to be the lifesaver role, was just plain stupid.Save yourself the time and money. This movie belongs UNDER a rock."
2,"good music, awful movie",I purchased the movie (which I regret) due to the fact that I thought it was a movie about various bands yet also had good music and a large cast. It did have good music yet I also felt like I was watching Glee gone bad. I could not take myself to watch the entire thing I had to keep fast fowarding some of the songs. You can only take so many talk-sing moments.
2,"ugh, i hate these movies.","I was curious to see what this movie would be like because Tom Cruise was in it, and I love Tom Cruise films, but this is kind of like a mixture of glee and american idol. The two shows i hate the most out of any show... i payed 19 bucks for it on Vudu, wish I could take the money back...."
4,Rock Of Ages,Very different from the Broadway version but good. Tom Cruise does an excellent job. I was surprised!I was not impressed with Alec Baldwin.
1,Painful to watch,"Wanted to turn it off, kept thinking it might improve.....was very wrong! There is time I will never have back"
1,Not in the mood,Maybe you have to be in the right mood. My wife and i were not and hated it. Couldn't finish this movie.
4,Fun movie,"Cliched? Check. Corny? Check. Predictable? Check. But fun, funny, and super singalong appeal. Tom is great, and so is the rest of the cast...I loved it!"
4,Tom Cruise makes the film,"I don't usually like musicals in movie form, but this was rather fun. Tom Cruise's performance though made the film."
3,Depends upon your age,"If you grew up back in the days of this music, than it's a great flashback, other wise it's just another movie."
3,Great music.....,"Enjoyed the music, but the movie fell short. Glad I saw it but glad I didn't go to the show to see it."
3,Wasn't what I was expecting...,"I wasn't expecting a true hollywood muscical, that being said it was pretty good. Worth the rental, and glad I didn't pay to see it in theaters."
2,Watch MTV and have a better time...,Don't waist ant time with this lame movie. The acting is so bad that you will think they filmed it in one day.
3,Rock of Ages,"(3.5 stars)A little corny but it was a great time capsule to my past. Interesting how many songs were combined.Mitch Taylor Kailua Kona, Hawaii"
3,Overblown,"Too long, if it wasn't for the music this movie would be close to unbearable. The performances were solid,especially Tom Cruise, the singing was surprisingly good,but the story was flat and long-winded. I have seen worse but I have seen much better."
5,Rocking!!!,Tom Cruise is the perfect 80's rocker!! Hilarious play between Baldwin and Brant!! Great music and vocals!! Would definately recommend to any child of the 80's who grew up with this music!
2,I Didn't care for this movie!,I think with all the money spent on this movie the producers could have put it to better use than to depict the life of a self-centered deadbeat entertainer.
5,Love it,I love this movie regardless of others opinion great fun movie and yes Tom cruise really sings. He is a perfectionist lol
4,Good music,Had a lot of the music that I used to listen to.. The cast did a decent job on the songs.
2,Not what the reviewer promised,"Read a review that said watching Tom Cruise channel Axel Rose was worth the price of admission. I disagree, although if I hadn't had such big expectations, I might have been impressed"
4,Good but not great,"I was lucky enough to see this show on Broadway in NYC and there is no comparison however I still found the movie entertaining. The 80's music is a great reminder of the bands from that time. I found it to be comical at times as well. It was cheesy, singing not the best but it was a fun, feel good movie to watch."
3,it's ok,This movie was just ok to me. I will probably never watch it again. The best part was hearing all of the songs!
4,Great Fun,"I am not typically one for watching musicals, but this one appealed to me, no doubt thanks to the fact that it involved classic rock...that's something I can get behind! I think the only other musical films I really cared for all that much wereSweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet StreetandDr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, plus the One More Time With Feeling episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Beyond that, I am not typically into musicals.Rock of Ages was a lot more enjoyable to me than a lot of musicals because of the classic rock numbers in it, plus this film contained some quality humor and I like the actors in it. My wife was going to go and see the actual musical play with her mom and we figured we should give it a watch and it was pretty entertaining. Check it out if you're into classic rock music and whatnot."
2,I can see why this movie kinda flopped,"Another unapologetic attempt at cashing out with a Greatest Hits list. Despite the star power behind it, it's so predictable that I guess I'd rather see Mamma Mia again. Alec Baldwin is the best thing going on in this movie."
4,Fantastic!,"If you love musicals and 80s rock, you'll love this. The plot line was a touch over the top (as it is in most musicals), but Tom Cruise was genius in this. One of the only movies I like him in."
2,Tom Cruise was the only good thing in this movie,"I watched this movie because I was on a flight to India. I actually expected it to be decent. Not great, but ok. It wasn't. The music was distracting, it didn't add to the overall story. I liked the songs, but they seemed to take away from the story, which was lackluster at best. The two leads were annoying. I love Alex Baldwin, but his bad wig was so ridiculous I couldn't take the role seriously. It was hard to tell if they were trying to make it a parity or trying to take themselves seriously. The only good thing in the movie was Tom Cruise. When he came on the screen and in all his scenes, he brought the movie to an all new level. He is the only reason to watch this movie. A good example of how a great actor can still be great in a really bad movie."
1,What a suckfest,"An unbelievably horrid movie. Total waste of my time to watch. I'd heard that Tom Cruise was supposed to be amazing in it, but even his stellar performance couldn't save this awful film. That's 124 minutes I won't get back...."
1,Rock of Ages not so good!,Rock of Ages was absolutely not one of Tom Cruise's best performances. He should stick to doing other roles that do not require singing. Certainly would not recommend this to anyone. Don't waste your time or money!!!
2,didn't translate,"Great music, great play, beautiful actress, didn't translate from stage to big screen. I loved the play but it came across as forced and corny on big screen."
5,Rock musical,Tom's musical talent definitely shined. The rock star attitude was unpleasant but understood. The addition of the musical talents of Diego and Julianna introduced my family to more musical options. Russell and Alec added an unexpected twist to the music. All the actors blended naturally to portray a movie so entertaining and powerful you can watch it repeatedly with enjoyment
2,"The music is great, but the movie is awful :(","I was going to give this only one star, but the music used in the movie made me give it two stars. I wanted to like this movie so bad, but it was just plain weird at some points;and the acting was really corny. The music in the movie is really good, but the plot for this movie was just horrible. There were so many times when I just wanted to turn it off, but I was still enjoying the music. I'm trading this in for an Amazon gift card if that tells you anything!"
2,If you are into Glee you may like this,"It had good music and some good points, but overall too cheesy for my taste. I grew up with all of these songs, but I am not into this display of the music. This is one that I will not be watching a second time."
2,What?!,"The only thing that didn't make us go crazy were the songs. We knew all of them. The people that sang them....were not very good....Well, maybe I am biased. I don't like musicals and have no interest in watching Glee. Sorry, people."
2,Meh...,"Meh... Wasn't really all that great, too cheesy, could have better acting. Tom Cruise as decent, but he didn't have much of a roll to play."
2,"Music ok, rest kinda out of my party league","Great cast, but the movie is so tacky.I do like the rock and roll songs, but the show setting in drunken rock clubs is not my thing."
2,not so good,was ok.. but didn't really get into the characters.... could have been much better... though it was ok as a rented movie
1,Eeeewwwww,I thought i would give it a whirl. should have rented it first. I never would have bought it. Don't bother.
1,one star is too generous,"This is, by far, the worst movie I have ever seengreat castpotential? perhapsDid they think it was going to be as popular as Mama Mia? I just don't knowit isn't even bad enough to be gooddon't bother, save your ears and your retinas"
4,Great music!,"Great movie. Not usually a Tom Cruise fan, but I liked him in this movie. I was a teen in the 80's, so I can really appreciate the music and hair bands!"
4,Better than I thought it was going to be,"It was much better than I thought it was going to be, having grown up in the hair band '80's, it pretty much nailed it."
3,"Music great, plot not so much",I graduated Highschool in 1988 so the music in this film brought back alot of memories. The plot left alot to be desired especially with so many big names in the film.
3,Great Sound track,Just had to watch this after the hype. The sound track brought back some great memories but the story line was silly. I have been a big Tom Cruise fan for many reasons & once again he didn't prove me wrong.
2,Not all that compelling,They tried to tell a story and the adaptation to the big screen fell flat. I just did not care about the characters.
5,Best Cheesy Movie,"I love this movie, have watched it over and over. Highly recommend it Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin are hysterical!"
3,A bit too nasty,Movie story was not bad but it had too much nasty stuff in it. The movie could have been funny and tasteful without all that extra crap added in.
2,Only good thing was Tom Cruise,"I will say what everyone else has said about this movie, ""Tom Cruise stole the show."" Or maybe he carried the movie... I thought the rest of the cast was phoning it in."
1,Not so great,"I thought this movie would be great. Lots of music and fun music. I love Julianne Hough. But I mean really, this movie was too, too corny and they only sang a few lines of every song. So if you loved a song, you didn't really get to hear it. All in all, I think it was pretty bad. Too bad Julianne let herelf get dragged into this one."
3,Remember the late 80's and early 90's?,"It was a trip down memory lane, but a little corny. What a bunch of colorful characters! Glad we've moved on, though."
3,Kind of silly,It was entertaining but so 1980's. I am not a Tom fan but he did a good job. It was not worth the rental fee
3,Good movie great sound track,This IS a cheesy musical type movie but the music is awesome....totally worth watching! I'd rent this again or even buy it.
3,Musical fluff,"Worth watching, but wait until it's on Netflix. Funny, great music and a blast from the past for anyone who recalls the 80's fondly. See it if only for Tom Cruise's performance."
2,Some fun...and lots of no Fun,I dont mind musicals...if they are done right...but some of the numbers here werevery painfull to watch. Not everybody likes stuff like Glee. But take away thecrap then you have a bit of good stuff to watch for...
2,There is nothing rockin' about Rock of Ages,"This movie was painful to watch. I, for one, knew what I was getting into. I love musicals, this is a musical- perfect match, right? WRONG. If we're going to have a rock musical then please- let it ROCK! The voices of the main leads were too smooth- Julianne Hough's voice was as far from rock n' roll as they could possibly get (and actually borderline obnoxious if I have to be honest). The plot line was weak, at best. There was nothing fun about this movie. I can handle cheese, when done well. Awful, just awful."
1,Dubbed and Dubber,"No plot, no acting, bad renditions of favorite songs...........YUCK! Lots of quality folks with no where to go.........shame on Adam Shankman!"
3,Okay if you are old,This movie clicked with us old folks but our children weren't there to understand the subtle nuances required to really get the story line.
1,Terrible toy - bad copy of the Original Doodle Bear,"BEWARE - This is NOT the Original Doodle Bear by PlayAlong - do not make the same mistake I did. I accidentally bought this one and my daughter hated it. It is a terrible copy and does not even work. The pens are terrible and leak.After I returned this and got the real Doodle Bear from Playalong, my kid hasnt put it down since."
4,Entertaining,"It's great to watch the grandmaster at work. I enjoy watching his movies. This one did not disappoint. The quality of the disc is lacking, The paper disc label appears to be printed by a bubble jet printer. Expected a higher quality print job. The graphics on the cover are low grade as well.However, the footage was good-to-go, no issues."
3,Seems to be a decent micro ATX supply,"Here are the connector details:1 ATX 20-pin harness (16"" long)3 IDE drive connectors1 Floppy connector1 Serial ATA power connector1 12V motherboard 4-pin power connector (16"" long)I like that the ATX/12V harnesses are long (I bought another microATX supply and the connectors were only 7"" long, way too short for my motherboard/case).Also included in the package is a 20->24 pin ATX adapter cable.The PS doesn't have a power on/off switch. It does however have a single temperature controlled 80mm fan (although it is a sleeve bearing fan and not ball bearing). The enclosure is zinc plated as opposed to shiny nickel or fancy colors.I can't comment on reliability as yet but thought I'd write this review in case someone else wanted additional details."
4,Nice Replacement PSU I needed quickly,"One of my business computers went out of commission. I ordered this power supply next day from Amazon and am very happy with it.It is a power supply, so I cannot get too excited about it, but it does what I need and was a decent price from Amazon. I am glad a read reviews because not all of the different Micro ATX PSU's have long enough cables. Thanks to other reviewers comments, I knew this one would have long enough cables for the desktop I needed to install it in."
5,Absolutely Love This product,"Awesome was not what I expected, but the results were awesome, I highly recommend this product it is a win win."
1,"""CRAP"" NOT ORIGINAL RECORDINGS!!!!!!!!!",THIS WAS A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT I WENT AND BOUGHT THE BOTH OF THEIR GREATEST HITS! THIS CD IS CRAP SAVE YOUR MONEY!!
4,good for beginners,I'm just getting started on my first non-oval layout and this book is invaluable. Contains all the basics and stuff you'll probably want to know when you get fancier.
3,Love from London,"The spirit is the same in yet another installment of Emily Franklin's fantastic Principles of Love series, but something's just a bit off about this one. While the new hints about Love's mother are certainly intriguing, they were the best part of the book. Love predictably gets another guy, and as well-developed as a character he is, in the end, he's just another one of Love's revolving door of random guys. Love's snobbish side seems to come out full-force in this one and it just wasn't the same. Something was just off, different about this book. It was annoying, really, since it's a series and one book shouldn't stick out as different from the rest of the series, but that's what this book does. Maybe if it were a stand-alone, or a companion novel, it wouldn't feel like filler. Who knows, maybe some of the filler plays a significant part in the other books and was necessary, but something tells me that isn't the case. Looking forward to obtaining All You Need is Love!Rating: 3/5"
3,Love goes to London,I found myself a little disappointed in this third book in the 'Principles of Love' series. The first two were better than this one.It just seemed to me that in 'Love From London' not much happens except that she's in a new city and kisses a guy she likes. Hopefully the third book coming out in the fall will pick up a little bit to make up for this one.
1,Bad Product,Smaller than I expected. It's less than 5 inches long. But worse was it didn't work. Hooked up battery and nothing. Returned it to Amazon.
3,c-,"well, it was a good time to give a review to this movie because I watched it last night but, ...."
2,Not my first choice for Lovecrtaft,"While this is an attractive volume, well-printed andwell-bound, and does include a nice selection of Lovecraft's best, Iwould not recommend it. I really enjoyed Ms. Oates' notes in the front of the front of the book: interesting and well-written, so what's my problem? She provides synopses of the stories, giving away the plot and ending. What fun is it to read a novel, when you've been told the ending in advance?"
3,Losing interest,"The stories are somewhat interesting and fairly unique. I am only halfway done with the book and have lost most of my interest though. Lovecraft doesn't seem to develope any of his characters at all and his writing formula is very apparent and strictly adhered to. This makes it a bit boring, but the premises of each story are interesting enough to carry the reader along. When comparing Lovecraft to his peer, R.E. Howard - I must say that Howard outshines Lovecraft in raw power, horrific, uniqueness of stories, interesting characters, and over all style.I'd suggest this book only for people interested in researching the sci-fi genre, but it lacks much for entertainment for the educated reader."
1,PRICKLY MINT,"Once this mint is in the mouth it feels like prickly sandpaper. It doesn't taste like any mint I've ever ingested, and it sticks to whatever part of the surface of your mouth it's laying on if you don't constantly move it around. To be frank, I'd rather swallow it and take my chances being digested as medication, rather than have to have this in my mouth of ANY length of time. Would definitely NOT recommend this product to anyone trying to stop smoking. There's got to be a better way than ingesting and having to endure prickly, irritating, awful tasting logenges like this just to stop smoking."
2,Totally Addictive Product,"These do help even a hardcore smoker quit, and the lozenges are not as annoying as the nicotine gum. However, the product is thoroughly addictive, and the manufacturer does not offer any support in quitting the lozenge. If you suffer from lung disease or shortness of breath, the lozenges can at least permit you to breathe clean air.The Original flavor seems to dissolve more slowly than the Mint or Cherry flavors, therefore you use less."
5,This Stuff Flat-Out Works. Period.,"I'm 30 years old. I've smoked for a decade now. This is the only product that negates my craving for a cigarette. Is it pricey? Yes, it's probably a little more expensive than the cigarettes themselves. However, in the long-run, it's going to save you a ton of money.I buy mine as Cosco, where I just got a 9-pack for 69.99 - which is like buying two of the regular boxes and getting a third for free, so if you have a Cosco card (or BJs or whatever) buy them there.They last long (over a half hour), they're not horrible tasting, and they really reduce your cravings. Start with the 4mg and work down to the 2mg after about two weeks.My cravings went away after a month.I would highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend this to anyone trying to quit."
4,EZ quit,"I was a light smoker (5-6 cigarettes a day), but decided to go ahead and quit altogether in order to qualify for some better (less pricey) life insurance. Went with the 2 mg when a co-worker told me how the 4 mg lozenges did such a great job for him. He was a 2 pack a day smoker and was able to quit smoking and is doing well so far.I have used them off and on for the past 3 weeks and they are helpful. I would caution others however that the first couple of days of use will leave the inside of your mouth feeling a little sensitive, but it does pass."
1,20 lozenges broken in small pieces,"In one package of 108, 20 or more lozenges were broken. This has happened in other shipments but there were no so many broken pieces. If this continues, I will not buy from you. It is too much trouble to return these. If I buy them at the store I can easily return them."
1,expired,i buy lozenges 2mg from DD Discount Central and its already expired !i can't believe that's its expired from 5/2011 and that's was before 3 months ?!
1,Free shipping?,Price is good with free shipping. Shipping charges were unexpectedly added to the item. This makes the item no cheaper than buying locally. Watch the free shipping offers!!! Charges may be added without your knowledge.
1,Just as addictive as cigarettes,"My husband starting using these almost 2 years ago, and he is totally addicted to them; in my opinion worse than cigarettes. They are expensive and from what I have witnessed they just don't work. Cold turkey might be a better and cheaper choice."
2,why prolong the agony?,"All these lozenges do is keep you addicted to nicotine. I quit ""cold turkey"" without any crutches and stayed off cigarettes for 6 years until a divorce gave me an excuse to start again. I have tried to quit again using these lozenges, and all they do is keep you addicted. You never get over wanting a cigarette. My sister-in-law has been chewing nicorette for 2 years. She still wants a cigarette, but chews the gum instead. Why prolong the agony?? If you just quit, you will be over the rough part in a couple of weeks, and, unless you start hanging out in places like bars where smoking prevails, you just might stay off nicotine entirely."
2,cheap but...,"I bought 6 boxes, they were cheap but the expiration date has passed 4 months ago when I bought them."
5,Beats smoking!,"These are certainly helping. I break them into four parts, and that seems to be enough to quiet the cravings."
2,Terrible Taste!,"If you are sensitive to foul tastes, like I am, then the original flavor is not the right product for you. I couldn't even give it a shot for longer than two days. I literally had a gagging sensation every time I popped one in my mouth."
3,Cuts down on cravings...,"They cut down on cravings, but it's pretty easy to start smoking again. Also (take it from me!) it's not to hard to get into a Commit Lozenge habit that isn't easy to get out of. The instructions are to gradually cut down, but that's not always easy. Please do try the patch first, before you give these a shot.All this said, the price here on Amazon is very good. I've seen the boxes of 48 at drugstores for the same price as the boxes of 72 here."
5,Best product on the market,"I actually stopped smoking 13 months ago with commit. I smoked for 30+ years. I quit once briefly with the patch and I've also tried the gum. Commit is not a cure all but it definitely works if you really want to quit. I found that the lozenges also reduce appetite. This product is the best I've found. Also if you have 4mg lozenges left, break them in half rather than buying the 2 mg. It worked for me."
5,Commit Lozenges are great,"I have tried to quit smoking unsuccessufully many many times.So far, this has been the easiest time I have had.Using Commit Stop smoking lozenges has made it possible for me to quit without the withdrawal symptoms.I have recommended them to all my smoking friends."
5,Amazing,"My husband smoked three packs a day, and has smoked for 43 years. With the help of Commit he has been smoke-free for 28 days now, and still counting. For him, that's a long time. Some days are easier than others but he is determined and has finally found something that really helps him."
4,Baton Rouge Confidential,"A standout in the glut of memoirs released the past few years, this warm and honest account about the travails and joys of raising a family after a dislocating move to another state is a pleasure to read. You feel as if you're talking to your best friend, such is the frankness found in these pages. Moses puts into words so many of the things people think and feel, there are times you think she must have been watching YOUR life to have written scenes with such clarity. Invite her in for coffee. Read her book."
1,Annoying,"I was all set for some fun, light reading, having read all of the reviews above... instead, I found the author highly annoying. She strains for humor, and the result is tedious. The recipes seem to be included largely to fill up enough space to make this qualify as ""book length."" Erma Bombeck she is NOT. I'm a stay at home mother of three myself, so I know a thing or two about living with children,and there are a lot more witty and wry things to write about than endlessly discussing projectile vomiting, things kids can spill on the couch and clueless husbands. Shirley Jackson's Raising Demons and Life Among the Savages are funnier and more ""timely"" than this (are they still in print?) Peg Bracken's old recipes are better than these."
5,Moses has the recipe for humor down pat,"Like Jennifer Moses' father, I don't cook. So why am I reading a cook book? Because the recipes are irrelevant. To wit: I sat in an airport, mad as a snake about a late night plane that was seriously late. As I started this book, I began to laugh so loud that the woman next to me said ""You sure are having more fun than I am , watching this dumb TV"". She was right . From first to last , Moses has written a book that is food for the soul... and for the funny bone."
5,A laugh out loud look at modern motherhood.,"This is a great book. Full of humor & warmth -- all about the fun & not so fun challenges of raising a family while keeping your own life. Moses takes us through a year in the life of a mom struggling to deal with three kids, a sick mother, & a husband who decides to switch careers. It's very funny -- even when it turns serious. I read it -- and really enjoyed it -- over a vacation weekend."
1,A huge disappointment,"I love reading about women and how they juggle career, family, and personal time, and was looking forward to doing so in a humorous light by reading Food and Whine. I just found the book to be too cute and too self-conscious to be realistic. By the end, I felt like I had spent a long time on a family trip with the Moses clan, and wanted out of the minivan!"
2,Falls short of its promise,"While the cover copy on this book makes it sound intriguing and funny, it really was a lot of whining and kvetching. I have two small children and if I wanted to read about someone else raising kids without humor, I'd definitely read this again."
1,Awful,"I Purchased this item for my youngest son of 6 children. He is going into the Marine Corps, delayed entry program. The rope broke and the eagle broke in half. Should my family see this as a bad omen?Will Not buy again"
3,"Not the best, but OK","The key reason why I purchased this book is because it was supposed to have a metal spiral binding, so that it could easily be laid flat on a table, etc. The version I received had a regular book binding and getting it to fold flat is kind of a pain. As for the content, while they list probably every important scale known to man, they don't do a good enough job of showing all the possible inversions of the scales and I honestly don't care for the way they lay out the information on each page. A better book is the Guitar Grimoire series (which I have also) and I would easily recommend those books over this one."
2,Not very helpful,"Not enough technical and helpful information for me. I think this book is more of a dictionary rather than a helpful guide for guitar players seeking to improve skills. You wouldn't buy a dictionary to understand grammer just as this book won't help in making you a better player. I think it might be useful to people who are professional musicians but for the rest of us, the book is hard to apply. I returned my copy and will be looking for something more applicable."
1,Hard to follow,"I absolutely adored Leisa Hart's Fit Mama DVD so I was very disappointed when this DVD didn't measure up.I don't think anyone tested it before selling it; the editing is horrible. A few times, they zoom in on her face while she is demonstrating a new sequence and so it isn't until the SECOND time she does it that you can see what she actually did. I honestly don't see how anyone can follow it. I finally had to just turn it off because I found it extremely frustrating. In the past, I've been good at keeping up with dance workouts, but this one was just too irritating."
3,Guess I'm in the minority,"Oh boy, I did not care for this book. I was very disappointed because of all the great reviews. I guess I am in the minority because so many others love this book, including Stephen King.To me, it seems like it was written to be made into a movie and perhaps as a movie, I would have liked it more. It kept my attention at first, but as the story droned on, I got bored with the charectors and they started to annoy me as well as depress me.I gave the book 3 stars however, because after all is said and done, I do feel that Peter Blauner is a talented writer. It's just that this book was not for me."
5,The Psychology of Hate,"This novel examines prejudice and hate from all angles as a detective and a convict recently released from prison come to terms with their personal limitations and the world around them. Well written and fast moving, it continues to give food for thought all along the way."
4,Writing too brilliant to ignore,"I'm not exactly a fan of crime novels, but I put aside my preferences to give this book a try because the writing was too brilliant to pass by: ""The boys, however, moved like they were made of spare parts...barely staying afloat in the sea of raging hormones"". Very glad there is much more available from oh-so-insightful Peter Blauner, as I am now planning to read every one of his novels."
4,BI Monthly Publication!,I was unaware that this was a bimonthly publication and was expecting one every month. It is a good magazine but I just thought other shoppers would want to be aware of this.
2,"Ads, ads, ads!","I purchased this 1-year subscription when it was a lightning deal and boy am I glad more money was not spent. Every other page seems to be a full page advertisement. In the most recent issue I received, you actually have to go all the way to page 42 before you do not run into a full page ad.The pages that do have actual magazine articles are odd font sizes and very difficult to read by writing style. The stories seem to be recycled every month, and usually have little to do with health. They seem to focus on the word ""Women's"" more than they do ""Health"". A 3-page Botox ad just doesn't seem very fitting to me in terms of health.Despite how much I tried to like them, after two months of going through the entire magazine ""because I paid for it"", it now heads pretty much straight to the trash.Not recommended even at a deal price."
5,Great Deal,I got this for my mother and she loves it. It is very educational in getting in shape and healthy. I would highly recommend.
2,Blech,Why does Women's Health seem like nothing more than an ad for the latest trendy product or device month after month?
5,Full of Great Informative Info,Not a lot of fluff or advertisements. Awesome workouts and great information packed into the magazine. So happy with my purchase!!!!!!!!
1,Not my kind of Magazine,"I picked this magazine over Fitness and Self based on the reviews I read. This magazine arrived last week and I was very disappointed. First the content is very mature (language and content), and I have young girls in my household. Needless to say this first copy is in the trash already. Second, I was looking for fitness, and healthy lifestyle content, if I wanted to read views on politics I will pick up News Week or the Wall Street journal. I won't be renewing this magazine, and wish I could cancel and get my money back now."
2,Please Skip,"As others have stated before, they send you back issues for the first three months, that you probably have already read. The magazines are ultra thin and chock full of eating and exercise tips that border on a obsession with being thin. Sex,clothes, and other activities are thrown in as a afterthought. Ugh... left a bad taste in my mouth and I canceled my subscription!"
1,Never received an issue,Ordered through Amazon in April and still have not received a copy. Called the customer service a few times but still have not received a single issue. Can't cancel the subscription as they have no record of my order in the system. Wouldn't want to order magazines through Amazon again.
1,Evil Subscription Practices,"My wife bought a subscription to this & didn't like it. She did not renew. Then they sent her a bill for another year subscription. She just threw it away, and now she has a letter from a collection agency for $16. If you check the Women's Health subscription forum you'll find many others with the same complaint going back to 2008."
1,Worst of all health magazines!,"I hoped to find good information on health and fitness in this magazine. What a disappointment! This magazine is totally superfical - tons of tiny articles with no real information, seems like a paste and cut job. Additionally, some of the information is plain wrong! If you are serious about fitness and health and want valuable information,I advise you to stay away from this magazine. Try ""shape"" instead."
2,Dull and repetitive,"My husband and I have really enjoyed reading Men's Health for years now, so I thought I would try Women's Health. The articles are very repetitive fluff(basically, ""how to look hot"" over and over again) and the models all look skinny and 20 years old. This magazine really has very little to do with health and the beauty articles are not particularly helpful. For beauty/lifestyle articles, I much prefer a magazine like Elle or O."
1,They sent me OLD editions!,"I signed up for a subscription in July, when the June, July, AND August editions of Women's Health had already hit newsstands, so I am very frustrated and dissapointed that they sent me not one, but TWO magazines that had been on newsstands for over a month. This means that instead of getting all 12 magazines, I'll be receiving 10 of them; the first two I had already read a month ago. Beware when subscribing!!"
1,Don't order this magazine!,"This magazine is 90% fluff and 10% exercise! If you want a no nonsense exercise and fitness magazine then keep shopping. It you are all about lipstick, make-up, and facial creams then this is the perfect magazine for you."
2,"Not a HEALTH knockoff, more a fashion magazine","Geared toward under-30 women who already look good. Heavy on the fashion, light on the health. Would not have purchased had I seen a preview."
4,A good read,I am enjoying the magazine. I liked my subscription to Health magazine a little more than Women's Health. This magazine seems more appropriate for a younger set. My college age daughters enjoy reading the magazine.
1,Where is my magazine?,I actually received a renew email concerning the subscription...out of 10 magazines purchased I only received 3.
3,Women's Health magazine subscription,"Good = magazine arrived very quickly, faster than promised.Bad = two issues arrived together, one from the month before, thus it was an 11 month subscription for me as I already had that issue. I have had trouble getting in contact with amazon to fix the problem using the phone number in my order confirmation."
3,Women's Health magazine,"I recently purchased Women's Health as an Amazon special. I like the magazine well enough and would rate it 4 stars. But 3 days ago, during mid-September, I received not 1, not 2, but 3 Women's Health magazines all at once - October, September, and July/August issues, which is really sort of lame. I can understand the September back issue, but July/August?"
2,Same Stories Every Month,"Don't subscribe to this magazine. Instead, buy 3 months in a row at your local magazine stand and you'll get all you need. I purchased this magazine because of a great Michelle Obama story but I soon found that every magazine says basically the same thing every month. Additionally, they automatically renewed my subscription for a higher price than I initially paid and let me know with an inconspicuous easily missable postcard. It was up to me to opt out. When I called back they offered to change the price but the magazine's behavior left a bad taste in my mouth so a ended the subscription. I give it two stars because of the Michelle Obama story."
5,Woman's Health Magazine Review,This magazine arrived quickly and I am really enjoying it. I am a fitness professional and I get a lot of tips and ideas from the articles. Can't wait to get next months issue.
5,Highly Recommend!,"This magazine covers a wide range of things that pertain to women's health such as beauty products that are good for your skin, healthy recipes, tips to deal with stress, etc. I would not consider it an exercize magazine as some people thought it would be and were disappointed. Yes it contains tips and workout routines, but this is not the focus of the magazine. If you are looking for a magazine that covers many topics that relate to a healthy lifestyle, this is the magazine for you. Another magazine I love and would recommend is Cooking Light."
3,what's with the back issues?,"I just received my first issue of this magazine and, the next day, I received my second and third. It is mid-september, and I now have a June/July issue, September issue and October issue all at once. NOT my idea of a year subscription when you get 3 months at once!The magazine itself is good."
1,worst,"Accidentally bought this one with one click and despite emails to amazon and company, am still stuck with the cost of this lousy magazine and now i see its auto renewal!! I do NOT want this!!"
1,ITEM NEVER RECEIVED- TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I ordered this back in January and never received it. They said it was sent back to them (this was after a month of waiting after the date I should have received it). They failed to send me an email saying I would not be receiving this. Customer service now is not doing anything about it, and they want me to pay for ANOTHER subscription in order to receive it. I already paid the bill for this! They will not give me my money back. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!!!!!!! GET IT FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE OR GET ANOTHER MAGAZINE."
5,Great Magazine!!!,"This is one of the best fitness magazines out there, I really like and recomended."
4,Womans Health,"I really like this magazine and would suggest it to most woman. I didn't like being sent the March issue when I place the order on March 18th along with the April issue (I already had the March issue). I also received the May issue about a week later. I was expecting to wait 6-8 weeks like I was told numerous times when placing my order. As for the magazine content, I LOVE IT!"
2,You're better off with Men's Health!!!!,"My boyfriend ordered subscriptions to Men's and Women's health (for himself and for me, respectively) about six months ago. It didn't take me too long to figure out that women's health could be more aptly titled ""men's health lite"" - - i.e., a similar magazine with significant alterations (read: reductions) in reading level, scientific basis, and practicality.The editors of these magazines seem to think that men seek scientifically-sound, medically proven facts for nutrition and exercise physiology, while women are looking for cheesy motivation and advice about lipstick colors.If you want fluff, you might as well save the money and buy one of the less expensive women's 'health' mags (Self, Fitness, etc.); if you want more substantial content, try Men's Health. (Which niche Women's Health fulfills, then, seems unclear.)save your money!"
1,Not at all like Men's Health,"If you're looking at ordering this magazine because you've been reading your boyfriend's Men's Health, really enjoyed the work-out and health tips, and you said to yourself ""Huh - they make a version for women, I should order it."" - DON'T! Reading Women's Health is like reading Cosmo, filled with celebrities, causal language and make-up tips (not to mention advice for men - probably gleaned from Men's Health - so that you can surprise your boyfriend?). Don't waste your time on this vapid stuff."
2,Mostly Childish Fluff.,"This magazine has the occasional useful health or fitness article, but I found most of it to be fluff. How to recover from a hangover, ""what he said and what he really means"" and childish junk like that. This is maybe more for teen girls or those in their early 20s than more mature women."
2,Same content online for free,"I've purchased this magazine twice, expecting the same level of content as Men's Health. Both times, I have been disappointed. The articles are useless with misleading titles and you can find 99% of the content on the Women's Health Magazine website without paying a penny. Seriously, save your money."
2,Not for Seniors,This magazine is designed for women who are younger than 50. Since I'm 62 I found most of the content to not be applicable to a woman my age.
3,Not what it used to be,"I've been a longtime subscriber to Women's Health, but lately it's clearly changed its target demographic to women in their early twenties. Those of us over 30 won't find much of value in this publication any more, sadly. Beyond that, there seem to be far fewer actual health articles and more Cosmo-style girl-mag articles, and what articles there are tend to be shallow and short. What does it say when my Allure magazine has much more in-depth articles than Women's Health does?"
4,Enjoyable Reading,This magazine provides good information on health issues and exercises tips. The only drawback is that there are a numerous amount of advertisements.
5,best show ever,"too bad the 1st guy to reivew this wasnt there from the begininning. i started watching in season 1, with the scarecrow and now dead whitney. shows makes me feel liek a kid again. all the mystique of superman without the acually superman in it. just plain ole clark kent. and now lois is here. the show just gets better and better. glad to see hes starting to get into the whole flying thing. if u havent seen smallville be4. then u better buy this."
1,Smallville order review,Hello. I am a soldier serving in Iraq. Believe it or not I cannot give a good review for your product because I never received it. I placed the order back in January of this year. I have had no problems with any other online purchase that I have made while in country. Thank you for your attention to this matter.Sgt. Ken Whittington 4185C co 1-172AR 2BCT 28IDAPO AE 09362-9997
2,Good for very small projects,"I was a little disappointed with the product. Some of the screws had worked loose and I had to rework the assembly prior to the first use of the soldering iron. The handle gets extremely warm and the cord to the power is a little short. I have an outlet right at my workstation, but, the working length of the cord is very short making it awkward to make some of the solder joints required.I use the soldering iron on my toy railroad for lighting in my buildings and railcars."
1,Not good for the price,I would think it would work good and it had a stand aswill which made me like it but after trying the product it really didn't get hot at the tip like it should have I even let it heat up for 8 mins and the tip stade gold while the rest of it was a black color I was kinda worried to even solder with this.
1,Save your money.,"Piece of junk! Here's why. As the hot dogs cook and the natural juices fall, the rollers have no traction or friction to move along the BBQ grate. The roller rack slides along the grill grate like a sled on ice and the rollers do not move. Also,$19.95 is another internet rip off price. Raley's market here in town has them for $9.95 regular list price and last week had them on sale for $4.98. Gee, I wonder why? Just more junk for the local land fill."
5,very good,I purchased this product for a friend and he said it is very helpfulto him with learning correct way to breathe.
5,West Wing DVDs,"I ordered the first three seasons of the West Wing TV series on DVD. The cost was much lower than buying from the official web site and when the product arrived, it was in 'brand new' condition as promised. It did take longer to arrive than I thought, but other than that, I am very satistied."
4,West Wing,"What can you say? Its great insight to the Executive Branch of our government. A little more dramatic in some places, a little less dramatic in other places; not unlike the real executive branch."
4,A straight forward and concise read,"At last a marketing and strategy text that is straight forward and easy to read. Not too much marketing bullshit, and a holistic approach that recognises that strategy is as important as the micro-marketing details. This was the foundation text for a recent MBA I completed and it enabled me to cover the classic Porter, Ansoff etc materials in a concise and integrated way. In addtion Doyle covers areas as diverse as corporate objectives and direct mail in sufficient detail without being boring or cursory. Solid stuff."
4,"A little bit dated, but SO worthwhile","As a new real estate agent, I bought a number of books on the subject, hoping to get a few different points of view. Mr. Hopkins has been in real estate for many years, and because this book was written in the early '90s when the market was VERY different, some of the commentary is dated. The concepts for generating business and how to build a clientele are timeless however. As with any book on ""how to"" I have taken some of the suggestions as gospel and others with a grain of salt, to best fit my style and my marketplace.Overall it is a very worthwhile book, which discusses everything from why it is important to dress a certain way to why it is so critical to maintain a certain attitude.There are agents with 20 years of experience in my RE/MAX office, and there are copies of this book on their shelves. Hmmmm. Makes you think it might be worth your money doesn't it?"
2,Reads like a car salesman,"Its an okay book. My only problem is the author provides a lot of scripts and selling techniques that use lies to manipulate people. For example he recommends pretending you may want to buy a home as a personal investment when calling of FSBOs who advertise ""no brokers"". Its also a very old book and some of the stuff that worked in the 80s doesnt work any more."
5,Classic Book For All Realtors,"A must read for any new Real Estate Agents. The material is older, but there are timeless techniques that any Realtor can benefit from. There is an abundance of information and inspiration. Highly recommended."
3,Great for someone who's already an artist...,"...While the murals in this book are absolutely gorgeous, they are very advanced. There's a lot of info on perspective, how to get it right, etc., and that chapter is golden. However, the how-to's on the actual painting, I feel, is lacking. The author paints movie sets for a living, if that gives you an idea of her skill level. I'm afraid I will shelve this book and pull it out only for inspiration, as it's not going to be something I can use as a reference other than to look at the paintings. A fabulous book for advanced mural-painters or artists looking for a new canvas, but too advanced for a beginner or intermediate."
2,Impractical,I've had this book for years and find it lacking. For me this is another how to book that merely showcases a specific artist's work. I keep returning to it thinking that maybe I missed something. Then I remember that there is nothing useful to me in it. I have books by Ursula E. and Martin Benad and find them to be far more educational and useful in all aspects of mural painting than this one.
4,A LOOK BACK AT THE MAGICAL 1955 BROOKLYN TEAM,"THE BOOK GIVES YOU INSIGHT INTO THE 1955 SEASON AND WHAT WINNING THE WORLD SERIES WAS LIKE, THROUGH THE MEMORIES OF THE SURVIVING ELEVEN MEMBERS OF THAT TEAM AND OTHER FOLKS WHO RECALL THE STRUGGLE AND EUPHORIA OF WINNING THE FALL CLASSIC AT LAST!BBOOKLYN DODGER FANS AND BASEBALL HISTORIANS WILL ENJOY THE STORY OF THAT MAGICAL SEASON!"
5,Good Read,"For those of us still in the Brooklyn area and those who ventured far away, this book takes you back to the care-free days of the ""Brooklyn Bombers."" Go for it!"
1,Completely inaccurate!!,Purchased this book while in London at Harrod's for around $65 very excited that i was getting a complete songbook. When i returned home with guitar in hand i discovered almost every song was in the wrong key with very few exceptions. Do not buy this book! Buy the Hal Leonard Beatles Chordbook instead.
3,Car case slots not made for today's cars,"When my son received the car case he was ecstatic! My son is a huge matchbox/hot wheels car fan and has over 100 cars and trucks and needed a better solution to the many small cases offered in the stores. But as soon as we openend the case we saw a huge problem. Most of the cars made today are too big to fit in the slots. As he kept trying to put his cars in the case he was getting frustrated because over half of his cars are too wide for the slots. We tried turning them different ways, moving them to wider slots, but they still didn't fit. Unless you have ""standard"" sized cars I would not recommend this case and I would give it 1 star. I also agree with the other review that this case is not very durable and within a few times of opening and closing the case I could see the latch was loosening. My son still loves pulling it around, and he would give the case a 4 star review."
2,Not sturdy enough,"My son has never taken this case out of his bedroom, yet the plastic hinge has come unhooked several times and spilled out the cars. This is not durable enough to hold the weight of 100 cars and put up with the abuse of a little boy. Maybe I'll buy him a suitcase and modify it myself to hold cars."
4,Great book for young readers,"This was a fun and relatively easy read for our 5 year old child. The words are easy enough to read and the illustrations are beautiful. We went to see the statue earlier this year and this book came home with us from the gift shop. It was great to hear our child read it on the ferry boat as we left Liberty Island. It was a welcome gift for our child and will be a source of fond memories. If your child has never seen the statue and you're planning on seeing it, this book would be a nice preview for him/her. If your child has already gone there, this would make for a nice memory builder. It is great for a child about 4-6 years old with an affection for the statue and who is interested in learning to read or build up their early reading skills."
5,Great,Very interesting and helped me learn more about the statute of liberty. I really like the book and would read more about it.
3,"Simple, factual book about the creation of the Statue of Liberty.","Pity it doesn't really grab our attention here. *shrugs* And my nieces really *like* the Statue, too, but they aren't interested in this book."
3,Bannie Ro,"This John Dere Utility Tractor is adorable. My nearly 2 year old grandson's eyes lit up when he saw it. It took him a while to get the steering wheel, but after a few days riding it into whatever was in front of him he suddenly discovered that the wheel he was holding onto had something to do with the direction. He's exploring that concept now and It is fun to watch. He loves filling the front bucket with balls and rocks and anything he can find and then dumping it all out by my feet. The back end is useless and for appearance only. You can't scoop up anything with it, but it is very cute."
4,Great toy,"My two year old son was given this for Christmas and has been having a great time. He quickly learnt how to use the foot pedal but hasn't managed the steering yet. I do wish it had a reverse function but I don't think he cares. My six, seven, and eight year olds have also had a great time with it. The front end loader has been used for carrying numerous things with great success."
1,How about have real PR folks to write a clueless title?,"Jim is a wonderful ad man no doubt, and fellow author May is a probably a distinguished lecturer. However, to dole out advice on PR without actually toiling the field like the distinguished folks at PRSA (Public Relations Society of America) did would seem like slighting the hard work and intelligence of the PR practitioners."
5,My Childhood Cartoon,"if there is one cartoon that will not get out of your head it is this one! last time I watched it was 15 years ago, and the music, the witch and Crosby the dog follow me wherever i go. this tape is a catch, and very difficult to get. It is beautifully done, and the storyboard is very funny. My kids wont grow up without this Chef-d'Oeuvre."
4,wow....,"I had this movie put on tape for me when it came on tv almost 17 years ago! Every now and then I think about the movie and some of the songs and then can't seem to get the idea in my head that I grew on an Anime film! Because, I really have no passion or any like for Anime at all, but this version of Jack and the Beanstalk is soooo weird that you'd probably catch yourself watching it once....then again just maybe a little later...and then it may come as a surprize to you that you watch it cause it's such an attention catcher. And for that first person to review this movie...I'm happy to have discovered that it's going to be on DVD!!! I can't wait! I haven't seen this movie in over a decade. To whoever plans on seeing it for the first time...definately a family movie and a child attention grabber!"
5,fabulous,i'm so glad this classic finally came out.. i've been thinking about this movie for years.. finally got to share this masterpiece w/ my teenage daughter who loves anime.. she loved it!!!!! ordered from amazon after best buy was backordered
3,DVD Audio Problem...,"I was delighted beyond words when my brand-new ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" DVD arrived today; I was immediately struck by the splendid picture and clarity of sound. Marvelous! However, after watching for a while, I noticed (to my great dismay) that the audio track was not in sync with the visual element: e.g., the sound of an door slamming occurs a good second or two later than it should. NOTE: This defect exists only on the English audio track -- the sound on the Japanese audio track is in perfect sync.In order to make sure that the error was indeed unique to the DVD edition, I compared it to my VHS copy and lo! -- the audio on the video cassette (English dubbed) is in perfect sync!I remain hopeful that I just received a bum copy, and am waiting for a replacement DVD from the website from which it was purchased. I'll be sure to report whether or not the new DVD suffers from the same problem.Has anyone else experienced this trouble?"
2,Shoddy DVD Release Ruins Experience for English-Speaking Audience,"I purchased the Hen's Tooth DVD with the same excitement as many reviewers here. I was delighted to discover that the film is as fantastic as I remembered and the video quality is cleaner than ever.However, my delight quickly turned into disappointment and rage as the English audio track was 1-2 seconds off throughout the film, so sound effects do not match up with the action on screen and the lip syncing is broken. This is simply unacceptable and completely ruined the viewing experience for me.I would give this DVD release 1 star, except the Japanese audio is perfectly in sync. (Too bad the subtitles are ""dubtitles,"" meaning the English script--instead of an actual translation--is played over the Japanese audio.)"
2,Think I found something BETTER,"The Glytone Mini Peel was a good product, but, it does leave me with questions. (1) What am I doing to my skin? (2) Should I be using something so harsh? (3)I did not like the scaly skin on my face.Then I tried the Microdermx by Nikkel Holistic Skincare and I just could not believe the feel and clarity of my skin. Also it has a firming feel.I do the full treatment 2-3x's a week and use it as a face cleanser every morning. And each day I can see the clearer, fresher looking skin emerge. It is like each day is better than the day before. I love it and just won't be without it.B.H. Chicago, IL"
3,Sweet,I got this off the mom xox box and cant wait till my bf little monster to watch .... This will keep her busy for about 2 minutes lol .. But no i will be neat to have to teach kids how to talk in other launges
5,The Best CD Ever,This is the BEST CD ever! It has the best songs on it. It's WAY better then KIDZ BOP. I give it 5 stars because the kids sound good singing my favorite songs.
2,No kick,I expected Habanero Pepper Jelly to have a little hot taste. It had 0 spicey hot taste.I could get regular jelly at the suppermarket. There was no kick to this jelly and I was disapointed.the Habanero Pepper was misleading.
2,Not so good...,"...Id reccomend it only to true horror fans. It's a story that reminds me of survival horror, and Ernie himself is farce of Thanos and there is some humor in the book. Black and white art is cool, therefore two stars. If it had been in color, every third page would be red , and I have seen this level of unnecessary violence only in Preacher."
4,Lady Death is awesome!,The book was a little dented on the top but it came to my home very quickly and is otherwise in good condition.Kudos to the seller.Awesome comic!
3,good sunglases,"Excellent sunglases, they give a very good vision and leak very well the solar light, only one is that they are breaking for the bases that they them fix to the mount"
4,Good songs. The previous cookie monster is more tolerable.,"I have warmed to After Forever's ""Decipher"" a lot more than I have to their latest ""Invisible Circles."" On impression, Floor Jensen's voice has more of a Tarja Turanen quality that makes the group sound like a Nightwish clone. (This is not a bad thing, mind you.) Mark Jensen was the original male growler. Unlike the newbie on Invisible Circles, Mark's cookie monster-esk growl is mixed in the background where it can't get in the way of Floor's performance. All tracks are solid, and the ballads are even better.Even though Floor has taken a more clean approach to her singing in newer albums, I prefer her opera-style vocals on Decipher. I recommend this album to first-timers, especially to those who have a problem with cookie monsters and would prefer a milder male growler to their everyday gothic metal."
5,Love it!,"One of the best albums I own. IMO, the best album of After Forever. Floor's voice is incredible and powerful and she uses it also in operatic way. I don't think she's a professional opera singer, but very good anyway. There are very catchy songs with interesting lyrics, for example ""Monolith of Doubt"", ""Emphasis"" and ""Intrinsic"". Buy it now, that's all I can say:)"
1,fake,"did not really tell the size of the truck, I would not have paid $15.00 for a truck smaller than a matchbox car, real rip off.would not recommend anyone to buy from these idiots"
2,Look Elsewhere!,"This book does an extremely poor job describing important topics in chassis and suspension repair, modifications and upgrades. Only brief paragraphs are dedicated to such topics as boxing frames, while entire subjects, such as frame-rail repair, are completing missing.Far from being a ""how-to"" book for the average do-it-yourself, home rod builder, it is simply a ""how-to"" install various after-market kits offered by some of Street Rodder's well know advertisers. Although the book is billed as a ""Chassis and Suspension Handbook"", it spends as much time on wiring and other topics as it does on the advertised subjects.The average, do-it-yourselfer better look someplace else if you want a how-to manual. However, if you are installing a Mustang II IFS or one of the other numerous kits constantly touted in the magazine, then by all means pick up this book. In fact, save yourself some money and buy my copy---only slightly used."
4,"Good stories, good flies","Sylvester Nemes little book about fishing with soft hackles is a true gem. This is not a detailed tutorial on tying these (very simple) flies. Instead it's a look at one man's fishing adventures, centering around the use of the soft-hackled fly in its various forms. He rambles a bit here and there, and there's not much in the way of descriptions or tying instructions, but it's like sitting down with a favorite uncle who, for the umpteenth time, tells you about fishing the Test when he was Over There in the Big One. I get a real kick out of this book."
4,dub tango,"I love the modern tango sounds of Gotan Project. I don't like this one as much as their 'la revancha del tango', but it is still good. The sounds of modern tango music grab your core and make you want to move elegantly, no matter what you are doing."
1,Don't be fooled,"Let there be no mistake, these shoes are terrible. The leather is rock hard. I am not exagerating. They are lined, which puts them just above a pair of $99 loafers I mistakenly ordered from LLBean a couple of years ago. But the leather upper is just the same, hard, cheap leather - many years - if ever - away from softening. They appear to be put together well but never expect them to flex at the ball. I am a runner and have very durable feet. These shoes cannot be worn without serious pain. They go back in the morning."
1,Frightening and disturbing!,"Most of this book is nice for Christian kids who have questions about stuff like drugs, sex, and other tough issues. However, there were two chapters, ""What about all this Occult Stuff?"" and ""What about all this New Age stuff?"" that I found deeply disturbing. The author claims that meditation and Eastern religions like kind and gentle Buddhism are Satanic!! Yes, sitting quietly and focusing your thoughts on love and light (for many New Age students this means the love and light of God or Jesus) is actually the work of the devil! I just pray that some troubled adolescent doesn't take too seriously the part about STONING TO DEATH someone who is or claims to be a psychic or medium. It's one thing to not believe in or agree with a religion that is different from yours. It is quite another to preach to children that all other beliefs are evil and should be destroyed (by humans, not God). Do your kids a favor and don't buy this book."
1,jam jam with whitesnake,"this book is horrible, take it off the market and burn it, don't waste your time or money.. looking for the real one, can you help?"
4,Trans fat free?,"I also think these are one of the better corn nuts flavors, and the Amazon description says ""no trans fat"" but the nutrition facts on the individual packages we received say 0.5g trans fat. I'm not sure which one is correct. They aren't expired or anything and I don't see the word hydrogenated in the ingredients. In any case I wouldn't overdo it on these, but they're tasty if you like corn nuts and nacho cheese."
4,great resource! some repeated material,It's a great resource for teachers who want to liven up a grammar lesson and give students an opportunity to have fun while practicing what they've learned. It does have a lot of repeated game ideas. The ideas are just used in different sections of the book for different grammar forms. But it cuts down a lot on prep. time.
4,A perfect interactive-style grammar book I ever had.,"I've been studying English for about six months with the well-known grammar books by Betty Schrampfer (Understanding & Using Eng. Grammar:Vol A, B). Recently, one of my friends recommended this book to me, because I was looking for additional grammar materials for further improvements. I found this book to be perfect, especially for a person who had already mastered some of the Betty's grammar books. Well-organized structure for each chapter, with clear and precise explanations/comments all through the chapters."
2,"It's good, if you don't type much","I've been using this keyboard for about a year. I couldn't use this keyboard if I typed papers, long letters, or even a review much longer than this. The keys won't press down sometimes and I end up going back and retyping most of what I'm trying to say. It's really been getting on my nerves. If you're looking at buying this product, don't. I paid [...] for it off [...] and still think I overpaid. Unless you type with a single finger, this keyboard will bring you a lot of aggravation. It took me about 10-15 minutes to type this."
2,Not very helpful for family members,"This book has some good information and details one specific case. As I was reading this book I kept thinking, ""no, that doesn't explain my mother at all"".The book doesn't do a very good job of explaining the different types of personalities someone with bpd exhibits. I already know that my mother has bpd. I already know what bpd is. I bought this book to help me learn how to avoid being manipulated and emotionally hurt by my mother. This book didn't really offer much to help family members at all.I think it is a decent resource for someone with bpd, I only wish I could get my mother to read it."
5,"Lost ,Then Found","The beautiful writing style makes Lost in the Mirror rewarding reading. Learning of the probability of the woman I love being borderline BPD, I undertook learning as much as I could about the disorder.LITM is the fifth book I've read in a series of excellent writings on the subject. It distinguishes itself through the genius of Dr. Moskovitz's presentation. I recommend it very highly. It is so well done I decided my dear lady friend would find it interesting with little chance of causing a disruption in our relationship.It is working! She hasn't finished the book yet, but it surely has helped us discuss our ""difficulties"". As I expected, she believes I am the subject the doctor is referring to, but at least it has her seeing some ""things"" that have her realizing some of the symtoms describe her ""inner"" feelings.I learned of her condition when I started therapy...and she will begin hers next week, with much thanks to this easy-to-understand, informative little book."
5,Excellent,"This is an absolutely excellent book. Although I don't have all the symptoms that would necessarily qualify me as having BPD, I have enough of them that I could relate to the content of this book. It made me feel as though I'm okay, even though I have certain problems.I think it would also be a great read for anyone living with someone who has BPD."
5,Good God This is a Great Book,"For anyone interested in borderline personality disorder, who has it themselves or copes with a loved one who does, THIS BOOK is a great help and a great resource!!!"
1,Poor understanding of DID/MPD,"Readers who have BPD may love this book. Those of us who have (or had) MPD/DID will find the comparisons between BPD and MPD rather poorly defined and described. The essential feature of BPD is instability in interpersonal relationships. The essential feature of DID is the coexistence of two or more personalities. Drawing comparisons between these diagnoses is silly--more so than comparing the moon and the earth because both are round, have craters, and fly through space. I wouldn't recommend this book."
1,"Pitiful, avoid it at all costs","Rough Guide's HUNGARIAN PHRASEBOOK is one of the poorest phrasebooks I have ever come across. In fact, it isn't even a real phrasebook, but rather a slim dictionary with occassional cultural commentary. This was *totally* unhelpful on my trip to Hungary, and I feel sorry for anyone who has purchased it.Bottom line: get Berlitz's phrasebook instead, but steer clear of this one."
2,Beware: NOT a Phrasebook!,"I must agree with the first review that this is NOT a phrasebook at all!After an introduction of Hungarian grammar on 30 pages or so (which is not bad and the only reason I gave it even 2 stars), there follows an alphabetically arranged dictionary, with phrases containing some of the words listed inserted under the word's listing, and boxed texts on cultural hints scattered throughout.Calling this a phrasebook is a misnomer!If you want a real phrasebook, go for the Berlitz or the Lonely Planet one."
1,Does not charge,I ordered this sync and charge cable. This cable only syncs but does not charge (and I made sure that my laptop was also plugged in to an outlet). I tried to contact both Amazon and Black Box for a refund and was unable to get a resolution. I would not recommend this product.
1,This [stinks],"This isn't worth the postage you must pay to have it shipped to your home. What a waste of time and money. A vampire with AIDS? A cast with no talent. A story with no plot. My 17-year-old son could have done better with a free webcam for subscribing to DSL. This TROMA disaster is an insult to filmmaking. Get out your crosses and Holy water and rid this flick from your library. This ranks, in my book, as one of (if not THE) worse films I've ever seen. Trust me. Get out now, while you still have a choice. PR"
2,Where do we get these actors?,"For some reason I continue to love Troma's films. I saw this one ... and I thought, ""Hey, why not?"" This is a creative vampire movie. It involves a vampire who has AIDS which is a rare concept for vampire movies. However, the beginning was so much like Queen of the Damned, I was waiting for Stuart Townsend to pop up. Oh, and if only he would have. The lead character could not have been any more annoying. Sure, Troma's movies are always travesties of great cinema, but almost always, they are incredibly creative. There is nudity, violence and language. This movie is strictly for Troma fans."
5,Excellent Coming-of-age book,"The Silver Desoto is an excellent book about a young girl who is caught between the small-time life during the depression and the Hollywood - characters she worships. Vividly portrayed are the people and friends she knows who are in high school and the lost loves and the consequences that occur.If you can get this book, read this book. It is worth it!"
2,VERY Small!!,"It's cute, but you can't really play with it. The monkeys are about 3"" tall and the ball is about the size of a quarter. I wish they had the dimensions posted before I bought this because I would have saved myself $15."
3,Wooden Monkey Bowling review,"This bowling set is very cute. However, I expected them to be much bigger. There is no dimensions and they look regular size in the pictures. These are little...maybe two inches in height. This is a good table top game.The shipping was great. The item got to me very quick."
2,Don't waste your money!!!,This bowling set is too small!!! Don't waste you money! For a few dollars more you can buy something better.
5,Excellent reference Guide !!!!,A very good tutorial and an excellent reference. I use the reference pages in the POSIX Programmer's Guide for all of the normal library functions and I know my program will be portable. Also this book is real helpful for Most of the Unix User for Project.
5,POSIX is IEEE/ISO/IEC standards.,"POSIX is only one operating system standard in IEEE/IEC.But now ISO have another oerating sysm standard, OSEK OS.OSEK OS is more slight, simple and real time oriented.Why Posix is not so portable and not so Open.NIST made a POSIX Test Suite based on old POSIX standard.But where is POSIX Test Suite based on new POSIX standard.This book was based on old POSIX.So, you can understand this with NIST posix test suite."
4,Cool shield,"Shield came in fast shipping. Received shield in really good packaging, however the sheild itself had dents and scratches. These were not caused by shipping as they were under the paint. Does not matter to me. Makes it look more authentic even though its not. Kind of looks like it may have been in a battle. How cool.........."
3,allright push stick,"For the price this push stick is all-right, not good, but just all-right. the feed arm was warped when i got it, it looks as though it had been left out in the sun. it looks as if it had been used before i got it because there was a really ruff area on the side near the tip as if someone used it on a grinder. the plastic used is kind of soft, although i like that, so when you hit your saw blade it won't dull or damage it. overall this push stick is not the best quality but it gets the job done."
2,Quilt holder,I purchased 3 flower quilt holders and was very unimpressed. For the money I would have expected real wood and it's pretty cheap particle board attached to large clips. I could have made these myself. Even the paint job was poorly done. I ended up painting them myself.Overall I wiuld not recommend this product. Even if you're only a little crafty you could easily make these yourself.
5,Mosby's Physical Examination Handbook,"For any nursing student this is a must book, It gives so much info that some may not even think about. Worth buying!!!"
4,Carry this one!,I am an NP student and have enjoyed this little handbook. I use it all of the time. It is very compact and full of helpful information. The only problem I had was that the binding was coming apart from so much use!
2,Not as good as I expected,"I am aware that it was for charity and that it was not all eddie, but was not pleased with any of the comedians other than eddie and the one before him (i think). There was a guy that looked like a turtle that i thought was going to slip in his own sweat and shaking. There was also a group of guys that hurt my throat listening to them talk, at first I thought they were kidding but.... eh.. Its just- nobody was funny.. Overall, not worth paying $15 bucks for. $5 or $10 would have suited better.By the way if you want to see ""good"" eddie izzard buy all his other dvds."
2,A bit depressing,"I got this dvd with the hopes of seeing more of the amazing Eddie Izzard standup, however, he appears in very little of the actual dvd. Some of the comedians/sketches are funny (the one compairing Eddie Izzard to Obi-Wan Kenobi is freakishly hilarious), but overall, I was very disapointed. However, there are a few funny moments, that almost make it worth it (the Yorkshire men skit for example). Oh, and watch the outtakes. They're almost funnier than the actual dvd.Note to American Audiences: Much of this humor is very British, and you will not understand it all. Likewise, some of these comedians have VERY thick accents that make it difficult for non-UKers to understand what they're saying. (Much like Brad Pitt's character in the movie ""Snatch"") You can tell that they speak English, but individual words are EXTREAMLY hard to make out for some of the comedians."
2,"Want more Izzard, please...","This product is a bit misleading. I was really expecting to see a bit more of Eddie Izzard, but he makes only a few, very brief appearances during this charity event. Skip this one and go for one of his stand up discs."
3,Good with aspects of brilliance and crap,"NO ITS NOT AN EDDIE IZZARD VIDEOHe's the Host, and between announcing the next act he does cut down versions of jokes from his hillarious stand-up back catalogue. They are stiil good but the originals are betterSome good comedy here, as previously stated the comparison where eddie izzard is suggested as the true obi-won and eddie mimic is fantsatic. Unfortunately you also get a stupid bald guy with a ridiculously high collar who is boring annoying, and very very unfunny.Some excellent stuff, mixed in with alot of rubbish. A stocking filler only if you already have evrything possible by eddie izzard first.Get real value for your money and buy these instead; ..ALL EDDIE IZZARD STAND UP VIDEO's ......ie:- ""dressed to kill""; ""The Definate Article""; ""Glorious""; ""Unrepeatable""; ""Sexie""; ""Circle"" IN THAT ORDERThe ultimate eddie izzard has got to be Pavlov's cat experiments (The definate article)...."
3,British Comedy,"As a devout Eddie Izzard fan, I was disappointed that he appeared so seldom in this DVD. The other comics varied in their performances, from giving a giggle to being obnoxious. Eddie, of course, was brilliant as an emcee, but this is NOT an Eddie Izzard classic. Real fans need to choose Glorious or Dress to Kill."
3,Not what I expected,"Unless you are British and have received a steady diet of British humor, there are large swathes of this DVD that will be unfunny. However, Eddie Izzard is a bright spot, as is the comedian that impersonates Eddie (until Eddie lobs a bottle of Evian at him.) The redo of ""The Four Yorkshiremen"" skit (originally by Monty Python) was *almost* funny enough to carry the show - Alan Rickman doing comedy doesn't happen often enough.Sadly, the 20 minutes that made me laugh weren't worth the other 64 that didn't."
1,Eddie Izzard We Know Where You Live,"I was a little disappointed in this DVD because I expected it to contain more Eddie Izzard footage, rather than numerous other comedians, most of whom I don't know."
3,Title misleading,The quality of the DVD was very good and I loved that it was hosted by Eddie Izzard. My only complaint was that I thought it was more about Eddie's comedy. In reality the movie is a taping of the 2001 Amnesty International event.
4,diamond profile wheel,"worked well to bullnose about 70 linear feet of porc. tile. No signs of wear yet. labor intensive to do your own bullnose, but saved 75% doing it myself."
4,Good but could be better,"Relatively easy to use which is lucky because the instructions are useless. The instructions in the packaging were not even for the countdown timer that I ordered.Otherwise, does what it is supposed to."
5,Great Product!,The Sportline Advantage 232 Countdown Stopwatch is exactly what I needed to accurately record the time that goals were scored in varsity soccer games. With the Sportline Countdown Stopwatch I could now accurately record how much time remained in the half or the game when the goals were scored. Great product!
4,Works just like it is suppose to,"The Sportline Walking Advantage 232 Countdown Stopwatch worked just as advertised. I used it every weekday since I purchased it in Nov 2011 and have had no issues. The only thing I would have liked to see as an improvement is a louder chime when it hits zero. If you are in a noisey area or have a radio playing a little louder, unless the stopwatch is hanging from your neck, it is sometimes difficult to hear. Other than that, it works very well."
1,Alarm is very faint,"If you want a countdown stopwatch that has an audible alarm you can actually hear, this one's not for you. Another annoying aspect is that the start/stop button is in a different position than their regular countUP stopwatch, so if you have both, you have have to re-training yourself to remember to press the right button on the right stopwatch to get it going."
4,good book,"not good for an average reader, little difficult than actual CBEST.practice material is good for twisting up ur brains. good luck:)"
4,Love It!,"I s'ppose my view is a bit bias, since I adore the show, and even if it were bad I'd still love it. But, I have read lots of fan fiction in my time, and I have to admit, I've read better DC stories."
4,Encyclopaediac!,"This book's a fun read and ""chock full of"" Illuminati information, but the art is taken directly off the INWO cards, and few guidelines are given to GMs who are not already experienced in subterfuge. Long-running non-fantasy campaigns that could use a ""something lurking in the background"" could benefit from this book."
2,"Too shallow, not enough HOW TO","I found this book disappointing. It had very little hard, practical advice on HOW to GM a conspiracy type game - such as how do you plot it out? How do you gradually reveal the conspiracy to the players, how do you keep them guessing and intrigued?It was also heavily padded with large, badly-drawn 'illustrations' that added nothing to the information, or to the 'feel' of the game. The space could have been much more usefully employed fleshing out the mechanics of running the game."
4,Really Funny,"Thank you for that show!I love it, really. It's the funniest show on TV I've ever seen.It shows real live. With all options. Good times - bad times - ups and downs.I am from Austria - not Australia - and sometimes it's hard for me to understand all the jokes, but it is ok. I'm a great fan of that comedy.At the end. If you know ""king of queens"", just try to get Kevin James' solo program: Sweat the small stuff. It's Great!"
4,A VERY FUNNY SHOW! WORTHY OF YOUR COLLECTION,"I caught on to this show in the second season. It is very funny and is well casted. This hilarious sitcom should have been the Honeymooners movie that came out in theaters! Not the horrible mess starring Cedric that did go to theaters. There isn't any reason to explain the show as most people know it well by now so, If you love the Honeymooners you should love this updated version with the Heffernans. It is a worthy purchase for your DVD collection. I have encountered a few small problems with the discs in this set so, check your discs throughly."
5,DVD mini review,"Obviously, the show is brilliant, so I will just touch on the dvd a bit.The transfer is excellent. Every episode looks as good on a 60 inch as it does on a 31 and as good as when it was broadcast on tv. I was thrilled with the results.The play all feature is wonderful. I love how you can sit down and devote a few hours to a disc without having to deal with the remote.I haven't watched the ""pilot"" commentary yet, but the behind the scenes segment was fun to watch. All in all, an excellent buy."
5,Still the best,It is funny that the first two episodes they show Carrie's sister. After that there is no mention of her and she just fades into the horizon. A lot of shows have disapearring characters. In the first season a lot of things are being worked out. The humor is still all there.
4,good!,I received the movie in the time it said and was wrapped up! nothing wrong with it. i will be looking forward to purchasing the other series soon
1,"Great show, HORRIBLE DVDs","This show is very funny..The problem is that the quality of the video on these discs is absolutely horrendous. Most releases of TV shows include, say 6 episodes maximum per disc. The bitrate is so low that they can fit 11 episodes on each disc - and they are still charging the amount for 3 discs that everyone else is for a 4 disc set!The quality of the video on this discs is really a disgrace, and totally against one of the main reasons people would by the DVD. They really should have compressed the video less and given us 4-5 discs. With the show in syndication, you can now catch up to 5 episodes some days. Just watch the show on TV and forget this set."
5,Genius!,"I can't belive I only started watching this show in it's 4th season! It never caught my eye until I just left the tv on while I was cooking dinner one day and I was like ""what show is this?""LOL. It was hilarious. So I found out what days and time it was on and that was that.Kevin James and Leah Remini are great together and their comedic chops really show. This show would not work with any other people or if it did it would not have been a hit like it is. Just watch!"
1,Queen of Tarts.,"The King of Queens has to be the worst show I have ever seen! I tried getting into this show through reruns and I just couldn't. The acting between Kevin James and Leah Remini is painful to watch, there's no chemistry at all! The writing is lame and hokey. I hate this show, can't believe it lasted for almost a decade. Skip this one."
1,The Rain Is Over!!,"The Kings rain is over PEO-PLE! i asked my acting teacher about this show and he said it was bread at the circus. Now, you dont know what this means so I will tell. back in Roman times they would give the people free bread when they went tot he circus so they would forget about the louzy affairs of the State. My actin teacher also said this show is padlum, which is an old word for baby food. its not acting, just a comedian doing his act bouncing if off of actors who wish they were in better shows or movies.He also said if you MUSt watch a sitcom it should be 3rd rock because the main actor in it is theatre traied or Frazer because the writers are intellingent.So, say good bye to The King. The Rain is Over, Peo-PLE!!!"
1,This show isn't funny,"This show is not funny. There is no way that anyone could believe that his wife would still be with him. Jerry Stiller has never been funny, Kevin James is less funny, and I don't know how it has stayed on the air. This is a horrible show and I have never once laughed while watching it."
5,Just what I needed,"Been doing this DVD for 3 weeks now and really feel a difference and can see a difference already...thinking of trying some of her other DVDs, she is really likeable."
2,The video is a mess,"I got the video because I was under the impression that I would get sexy arms. I got the video and what I found out was a very poor made exercise video in where the people in the video are not even coordinating with the main trainer ""Lisa Heart"". The video seems to be more focused on performing the exercise in a ""sexy manner"" versus doing the exercise in a correct fashion. Now, all that being said you can at least get 15 min out of arm workout."
1,movements awkward,The exercises in this dvd are awkward. I have attempted to do the exercises several time with no result. Iwould not purchase this dvd again.
4,tea party fun,My 2 year old granddaughter loves this. She is practicing pouring and concentrates on the process very intently. It is a montessori experience for her
4,Great Tin Tea Set,"My 3 YO daughter has a fixation with Tea, and this set was great for her. She loves to actually pour water from pot to cups and such, and this set works for that, althogh she makes a huge mess but that's not the toy's fault!Its a toy set, so parts are not huge, but works well as a play thing. Paint and quality seem to be very good, and I'm pretty picky."
5,AWESOME TEA SET MY 3 YR OLD LOVES IT,"MY DAUGHTER LOVES MONKEYS IN GENERAL,SO CURIOUS GEORGE IS A BONUS. IT'S PERFECT FOR LITTLE KIDS TO HANDLE AND ITS AFFORDABLE $18, IS WHAT I PAID ON AMAZON. SO I LET HER GO WITH IT AND MAKE SURE I DRY IT OUT THROUGHLY OFTEN. ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PICTURES ON THE PLATES AND CUPS ARE INTERESTING TO HER AND HER FRIENDS. IT DOESNT HAVE A CARRY CASE, THATS UNFORTUNATE BUT IM SEARCHING FOR A RUBBERMAID WITH A HANDLE."
4,Sing the Word,"The Sing the Word series was recommended to me by Carol Joy Seid, an educational consultant, for my language delayed son. I purchased the CD at one of Mrs. Seid's seminars and I'm glad I did. My son has latched onto one of the songs and is attempting to sing them all. He particularly likes Thy Word Have I Hidden and will sing it along with the instrumental only tracks. This really is an excellent way to teach scripture easily to any child. I'm looking forward to collecting all the Sing the Word CDs."
1,Paper Thin,"This tarp was bought to cover our round roof for the winter, until it can be completed in the Spring. The first windy day its grommets ripped right out and it blew half off. It's paper thin so either when it blew off, or while trying to get it back up on the other half of the roof it got smallish holes all over the place. We've since had to spend double the money trying to salvage what's left so we can still use it for now, but are forced to find and buy another, better tarp to last us the rest of winter."
2,Mom always said...,"Having and playing a myrid of guitars, I actually like some of the cheaper guitars. There is something to be said for the relaxation factor knowing you are not going to scratch your expensive baby while just practicing. Having said this, I personally would not recommend this guitar. The wood grain is a photo of wood, not a bad thing,(a lot of cheaper guitars employ this tactic), but this is a particularly light guitar. Feels toyish. It is one of the few guitars I sent back. And, I own and play Squier,Epiphone,Palmer,Ripley,Tesico,Silvertone,Highlander,Washburn,Berhinger,Zepplin,I think you get the idea. Look elsewhere. Look into Hare Guitars."
3,PARTY GIFTS,I COULD NOT FIND THIS GUIDE ANYWHERE ELSE AND I NEEDED IT FOR GRANDSON 8TH BIRTHDAY RECIEVED IT IN TIME FOR THE PARTY GREAT FUN WAS HAD BY ALL. GUIDE WAS GREAT AS ONE CHILD READ ANOTHER PLAYEDTHANKS SO MUCH TO AMAZON.GRATEFUL GRANNY
3,Abacus Pilot Shop,"I own Pilot Shop and must say it is impressive. There are many different planes to add to your collection and lots of scenery and useful utilities. The only problem I can see is that most planes share panels. I currently use FS 2000 Professional Edition and I was able to convert the planes to it. Unfortunately the flying boats that are included cannot do their thing on 2000. The fighter planes are amazing, however. No matter what version you use these planes are pretty good."
5,Small book that will make you think,"I wasn't sure about this book when I started reading it. With the title of The 60-Second Christian, I wondered if it would it be like fast food, without much substance? I was pleasantly surprised. Although the book is thin & very easy to read, it proves to be very thought provoking. What does being a Christian boil down to? Have we made it too complicated and maybe gotten a little off-track from Jesus' teachings? This book offers some insightful, reflective basics that maybe we need to get back to."
5,The making of Wolverine!,"The Weapon X TPB shows the story of one of Marvel Comics most popular characters, Wolverine. The plot details one of the most integral points in the characters life; when he was used as a human weapon by the orginization Weapon X and how he recieved the adamantium metal bonded to his skeleton. An excellent story and an interesting period of the characters life, its a great read for those not only interested in the character, but comic history as well."
5,Wolverine: Weapon X,"The story is well written and informative, yet the graphics are extremely horrible, looks as if drawer was on LSD."
4,no wonder logan's crazy,"you like wolverine and wanna learn how he first got the metal this is your story right here boy action filled like any wolvie story the professor was a good villian and who was he talking to I used to think sinister, apocalypse, sublime even xavier now I think kit might be romulus. love how logan went crazy at the end and killed damn near everybody the professor got his hand cut off and was later killed by silver fox which was gladly appreciated love bloodlust stories like this."
5,The Best Wolverine Past Story,"In this book you will find, action, an interestig plot,that will blow your brain, will make you ride in an violent adventure, the drawing it's not an conventional art but good enough. YOU MUST READ THIS FINE PIECE OF COMIC ART."
4,Great inexpensive torch....,"I bought this torch less than a year ago and have enjoyed it. I used it for soldering small sterling silver pieces, and it worked fabulously. Recently, though, I noticed the knob had acquired multiple cracks around the top plastic seal, similar to a spider web. Needless to say, I'm afraid to use it anymore for fear it will leak. I'm not sure how the cracks developed- possibly I was screwing it on too tightly? Otherwise, it is still in good shape. Considering the prices of some of the upper end torches available, I would have to say it was a decent deal for how long it lasted."
4,BERNZOMATIC ST900D 019527 Mini Torch,"This is a great all-around torch for the money. This model is used by most of the students in my jewelry class and is more than sufficient for most soldering projects. The Mini Torch is very cost efficient to operate - just uses 1 disposable bottle of propane versus the more expensive precision torches that require both oxygen and one other form of fuel. After purchasing one of these torches for myself, I picked up 2 more for classmates."
1,Discontinued,"I just purchased this torch a week ago. After reading the reviews I went in search of replacement tips. I was not able to find them and finally emailed Bernzomatic. This was the reply I received:We no longer have the replacement tip kits for the ST900D torch as it has been discontinued.So, if you purchase this torch it is good for 10 hours and then it can get thrown away. How very disappointing. Bernzomtic does not have any tips and has no intention of making them available for people who have purchased this product."
5,torch is great,"Unit is better than expected, the solder attachment is a pleasant surprise, in that it really works well. The valve right at the torch is easy to use."
1,My LEAST favorite...,"I reallllly don't like this one. I didn't care for the instructor, and I really don't think she should be instructing ballet. It's very, very, very obvious that she isn't a dancer. I also found the set and the costumes annoying. I own a LOT of fitness dvds; a lot of those are ballet toning or dance aerobics. I have to say, there are MUCH better ones available. (And, btw, this is the only negative review I've posted, I wouldn't be posting one now if I didn't realllllly dislike this one.)"
5,Really well done,Liked it much more than I thought I would...going to try her other ones too. Very well done and fun.
5,Powerful read. New way to look at the business landscape.,"At heart, Kinetics taught me something i've observed but never really cognizant of -- how ""events"" are replacing processes. It powerfully articulates a new model that all companies need to consider moving forward to be successful. How interesting to say that unpredictability can be a competitive advantage! Relevant to both CEOs and executives on the rise. Must read."
1,$20 for Buzzwords???,"Stringing together buzzwords is not equivalent to insight, someone should let the authors in on that secret."
1,Kenetic Hyperbole,"This is just the type of non stop, fast paced hyperbole that you would expect from a big consulting firm. Long on hype (the sub title of the book is the first clue) and short on substance, steer clear of this cotton candy for the brain."
4,Refresingly without cant,"To be sure, some of the concepts are not new... but after the mind-numbing exhortations to become agile and nimble, this book offered real people in real companies with real track records describing their own efforts in pursuit of agility. I took away some ideas I plan to apply in my own work."
1,Save your money,"Corporate Kinetics is a quick and easy read, but there is really nothing -- nothing at all -- of substance or practical application. My recommendation is to save your money."
5,On the bonny banks of Clyde,Roamin' in the Glomin'On the bonny banks of ClydeRoamin' in the Glomin'With my Lassie by my sideWhen the sun has gone to restThat's the time that we love bestOh it's lovely Roman' in the Glomin'.
3,good imformation about gems,"I got this book cause I have a small collection of stones. And gems that I just bought. This book has alot of information, but I did not like that some people claim lots of pictures. That is not true. This is more about the name of gem, where they came from. And imformation in back how to care for them in cleaning. A list for birthstones different kinds really.I would try to find something that has pictures if your not sure of a gemstone and alot more information on more stones."
1,Total rip off,"Like stated above; Both Satyricon/Nocturno Culto songs and Satyricons' ""Repined Bastard Nation"" is missing from the DVD, even though they are listed on the track list on the cover.Except for the two mediocre performances by Mayhem (in bright daylight which totally kills the mood) this DVD was completely worthless to me."
3,poor packaging?,"They are fine, smaller than I thought. A lid was shattered when I opened the box. For the price, it is fine, though not totally thrilled with it."
1,Where is it?,"They're ink tanks, so not much to say. But I purchased them on 07/04/2006 and as of one month later...no delivery. Amazon seems to have a stocking problem on this item."
1,"GPS is ok, Bluetooth doesn't work",My husband got this as a birthday gift and ended up having to send it back after one day. The gps system seemed to work fine for him except for the fact that it took forever to get the time correct and to not change on him. The books didn't give any direction on this problem. Then when doing the bluetooth function the screen kept freezing on him and after turning it off after the crash it wouldn't even let us detect another device. Too many bugs to even bother getting a replacement.
