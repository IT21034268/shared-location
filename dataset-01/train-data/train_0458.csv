4,Dyson Mini Turbine Tool...,"I recently received this as a Like New item for my Dyson DC41 vacuum. With this attachmenet, my Dyson is now essentially the same as the Dyson DC41 Animal model. I purchased this in order to use on my 3 sets of stairs that I have throughout my house. I found the suction to be more than adequate and it removed the dog hair from the stairs with ease. We are very happy with our purchase."
1,Don't bother,This product is worthless. The items that it will clean without bogging down the brush are so limited that it's a waste of hard earned money. I'm truly sorry I bought it. It's a black mark on Dyson's lineup of other great products.
3,"Like it, glad to have it, don't LOVE it.","I ordered this the same time as my Dyson. It works great on furniture...but not so well on stairs. At least on my stairs. I have carpeted stairs. The tool worked okay..but to get the same results as i did from the vacuum, i had to push down on it and work it back and forth. Wore me out :) But, if i pushed too hard, it would bog down the wheel. I didn't find that it had the power that i needed/desired. Again...it could be the combination of my stairs/carpet with it. However, i am glad to have it for the furniture. Works great on that."
3,Good but not great,"I bought this thinking it would make my job of cleaning the cat hair off my couches much easier. While the tool certainly sounds impressive when it starts up, it didn't take the cat hair off my couch like I thought it would. While I certainly don't have to work AS hard to get it off this wasn't the gift from the Gods I was hoping for..."
2,Good for adding clutter to your closet.,"One of these was included with my Dyson; I'm quite amused that it costs so much. As most of the negative reviewers have mentioned, as soon as you touch the brush to anything, it stops spinning. Would you tolerate that with the main vacuum brush?I do often use this when I need to vacuum carpeted steps. I don't do it that often, so I'll get out the attachment, try to use it, fiddle with the ""one dot""/""two dots"" switch, wonder if I have it hooked up wrong because there's a ""press to release"" button that doesn't do anything, then give up and just vacuum the steps by using the ""regular"" beater of the vacuum on the step and follow up with the crevasse attachment. Then I'll put this back in the closet until the next time I forget how well it works."
1,Cheaper to just buy a hand vac!,"This thing is worthless! The brush was hardly spinning on our medium-pile carpet - and the suction is dramatically reduced. On the plus side, our ferrets had some fascination with it and kept running away with it and hiding it under the couch.You're much better off spending LESS money and buying one of the below units, all of which have great reviews and spinning brushes - and you won't have to deal with the awkward hose either:Shark SV736 15.6-Volt Cordless Handheld Vacuum Cleaner with Motorized Brush, Colors Vary (Gray or Green)Black & Decker HV9010P Retriever Pet-Series Cyclonic-Action Corded Dustbuster and BlowerEureka 71B Hand-Held Vacuum"
1,Turbine Tool should be recalled,"For the Animal DC17 to be such a great vacuum, I thought I was using the turbine tool incorrectly. After reading the reviews I realize that there isn't any error on my part, it is the tool that is inefficient. I emailed Dyson to inquire as how to use the tool correctly and they have never responded."
1,Piece of JUNK with a neat name,"This isn't even worth it if you can get it for half the cost!I recently bought the DC15 All Floors model for $295...SCOREThis vacuum is fantastic.I really wanted that turbo tool though.That would turn my ""all floors"" into an ""animal"", I had to have it, I had to see for myself, even after all the single star,bad reviews given here.It just couldn't be that bad..Well it's junk, I defiantely (yes defiantly) saw for myself...You will do much better using the 3 tools that came with the vacuum and are readily available on board.The Turbo Tool does stop when it touches the intended cleaning surface.The suction isn't there either with the filter on the side and the holes in the adapter area.If you didn't waste your money yet, DON'T!"
1,this tool is worthless!,I bought the purple dyson animal which comes with the mini turbine tool. The brushes stop rotating as soon as it touches any material. You may as well use any cheapo air suction tool! I can't believe that this tool is a major selling point for animal owners. It's a rip-off.
1,Awful Performance,I love my Dyson DC14 Animal but this tool is useless. It does not have a powered brush bar and so therefore it just does not spin. It barely turns and if you are thinking of using it to get the stuff off your stairs it won't do it.I am surprised at what a bulky useless tool attachment it is.Really Disappointing !
2,Not up to Dyson standards,"Total waste of money. The turbine stops turning as soon as it hits surface, any surface. I should have read and heeded the reviews before I bought this. Definitely not up to Dyson rep and standards."
2,Not good as you expect,With this high price and what you got its ridiculous and you should think again if you really want to get this item.&#8203;
1,Fancy - but doesn't work. READ ON FOR BETTER PRODUCT:,"You can read countless reviews about the Dyson vacuum and I would add nothing to it other than this:If you're looking for an attachment to remove pet hair via the hose, DO NOT buy the Dyson tool (for $50+). It simply doesn't work. BUT....We have 2 white, long hair pets and emerald green carpet. I finally found a tool that works! The Hoover Windtunnel Turbo Brush (Part # 40200013) fits the nozzle on my Dyson perfectly. That little sucker CRANKS! The brush spins hard even when it's touching the carpet. It's super easy to unclog the long pet hair from the brush. You squeeze two side buttons, it opens to 2 half pieces, you extract the hair that is wrapped around the brush and it starts whirring again. PLUS, I think I paid less than $10 to get it on eBAY.Hoover Windtunnel Turbo Brush Part # 40200013 -"
2,Dyson Mini Turbine Tool,"This accessory is definitely not worth the money. It works OK, but is easily bogged down if you put too much pressure on the surface to be cleaned. You then have to pick it off the surface and let it start spinning and come up to speed. I feel Dyson could do better to match the performance of their vaccuums."
5,great on stairs!,"Used with my trusty old DC-07. We have a golden retreiver and a toddler, leading to a lot of hair and mess. I bought this to use on the stairs, couch cushions and sides, and dog bed. It works wonderfully, even on the medium shag of the basement stairs. It doesn't make cleaning easier, just more effective - picking up much more than before. Unlike other reviewers, mine doesn't stop spinning when I press it onto the stairs or cushions. a great tool to have!"
1,complete dissapointmint,"I was so excited to get this tool, I happened to get this with my dyson animal vacuum, but regardless it stinks. Doesn't pick up cat hairs, or hardly anything. The turbine spins, but it doesnt help to pick anything up. The tool is pretty much pointless, and not what expected at all. Thought it would be great on furniture, the mattress tool is way better."
1,DO NOT BUY unless replacing on new machine,I tried to use this on my DC07 that is 8 years old. Did not work... I guess there was not enough suction to turn the brush head. I returned it!
1,not good,Dyson Mini Turbine ToolThis tool was no good because it did not fit the Dyson Vacuum cleaner that I purchased at the same time.There should have been more information as to which tools fit which machines.
3,Finally figured it out!,"I received the Mini Turbine as part of my DC17 Absolute Animal. I would not purchase it separately. Not worth the price! I too had problems with the beater bar stopping as soon as I would even come close to my couch cushions. I have an ultra sueda couch and the fabric on the cushions is loose. When the Mini Turbine would come in contact with it would suck up the fabric and instantly stop the beater bar. When I used the tool on the arms of the couch where fabric is very taught, it worked fine. The moral to the story is it doesn't work at all on loose fabric and works fairly well on tighter fabrics. I didn't use it on carpet because I have wood stairs. The fact that the tool uses suction to make the beater bar spin explains the marginal results. It's ok but I wouldn't write home and tell Sally about it."
2,The only time Dyson looses suction,"I got this attachment with a Dyson Model 14 full kit. While the vacume is great, this attachment isn't. While it still has decent suction, it is completely inadequate to spin the turbine head when its in contact with anything other that a hard surface. If you try and use it on carpet the turbine head will actually sping BACKWARDS from contact with the carpet. I tried cleaning pet hair off my car seats and this attachment was woefully inadequate at best. The small attachment tool for the wand does a better job."
3,Works but clogs up a lot,"Works well, necessary attachment for stairs and such but it regularly gets clogged with pet hair and needs frequent cleaning."
1,"Does not pick up hair, awkward design","This attachment is kind of difficult to use. It has to be placed in a certain position for it to work. It doesnt pick up hair like it claims. I have tried using it on my stairs, and in the car,and it just does not do the trick...not impressed"
2,Very poor perfomance,Compared to the original equipment that came with our Dyson Animal this unit under performs greatly. I had read several reviews on this product thta said it was a far cry from the original but took it with a grain of salt. They were correct. It is a poor replacement unit and I expected more from a Dyson product.
1,Not what I thought it was,"I have a Dyson DC17 Animal which came with a turbine head and it does a reasonably good job on stairs. I thought I was ordering the new tool that doesn't have a beater bar on it (my mistake). I decided I'd give this a try, even though it appears to be a chintzier version of what I already have, only to find it doesn't fit my vacuum. So I can't vouch for how well it works. I do love my Dyson vacuum though."
4,Works as expected,Bought this product with some hesitation based on the wide range of reviews but my wife says it does as expected. Its not going to clean a room but she uses it in small areas and up the stairs and works to good.
4,Great on Carpeted Stairs,"I bought this tool to clean carpeted stairs. It works great for this task.Based on older reviews, I'm wondering if this tool has been re-engineered. I have no trouble with the brush stopping or clogging. It works far, far better than similar tools on other vacuums.Four stars not five? The tool is overpriced by about $30."
4,From the heart,This CD is a refreshing change from the ordinary. It's clear that the music and message come straight from the heart.
3,These guy's can rapp!!!!,"Yeah,Yeah,Yeah, you know the song poison ivy???? The song is on this disc,but the 12"" inch version is alot better.This is a pretty good bass cd though, and the dude's can rap good too!Check it out Yall."
2,For real 3M3 fans only,"This record was the biggest disappointment in my latest Amazon order. It's basically a collection of B-sides and unreleased tracks - mostly ""out-of-context"" and mixed together without much understanding. It's a far cry from their ""grand"" records (which are mostly not available at Amazon, like ""Heart of Uncle"") and was filed under ""other"" soon afterwards.You will still find some quite good songs on it, but I prefer to hear CDs as a whole, and this is not much fun here. But the main reason why I don't put the pop-up menu to zero stars is that the band is just phantastic with innovative and virtuous musicans. But why should I buy their dropout songs that even they wouldn't like to have on their records?"
5,piero: san francesco frescoes,"having seen the frescoes at arezzo less than 12 months ago, i was intrigued to find out whether the images in this book matched my recent memories: they did, and more, because the close-ups were a further revelation, since i could not get so close to the frescoes when on the spot. i am grateful to skira for giving me this wonderful bonus. the book has been a continuous presence on the lectern in my living room ever since amazon delivered it a few weeks ago."
4,"Good ""Best Of""","Maira Callas was never a favorite of mine, but she is notable as a passionate, (but sometime shrill to my ears) performer. This collection is a good single record tribute to her operatic legacy."
4,An excellent Callas album,"I am the only 12-year-old I know that loves opera. I am pretty much fascinated by the great opera singers of the twentieth century. That being said, I've never really been able to get into Maria Callas. My mother, a voice teacher, adores her. I myself am more of a Sutherland fan. BUT I can recognize a great voice when I hear it and Maria Callas, in terms of technique and sheer dramatic, emotional power, is absolutely unequaled. I think my main problem with her is that I am a person that loves pretty voices and Callas, well...doesn't really have one. But she is one of the few singers I have heard that has been able to move me to tears. I think the album is worth getting just for the EMOTION in her voice."
5,Sublime,This is one of the best CDs ever made!! The voice of La Divina Maria Callas brings to life not only the lyrics of each opera but also the emotions of each character. A glass of wine and this CD are a perfect combination for a most memorable evening.
5,La Bella Callas,I don't think there is any soprano in the last half of the 20th century who has a following like Callas. Listening to her sing on this recording just makes it clear why she was considered one of the greatest sopranos ever and continues to dazzle listeners to this day.
5,Excellent,I love this CD. It includes the best performance of romantic heroines in opera by Maria Callas. I really enjoyed it and each time of listenting can be more understanding this great artist.
5,I adore this CD!!!!!!,Maria Callas was the greatest singer ever. I find her voice to be stunningly beautiful. It is a voice you'll love forever once you've learned to discover its beauty. This woman had me in tears... A feat neither Sutherland nor Sills achieved. Brava La Divina!
5,The Mental Body,This is one of my favorire books. Amyone who reafs this will never think or be the same again. The convepts are valid and allows readers into a world of knowledge they might never have been able to glean from everydsy life. A.E.Powell contributes volumes to our clarity of the workings of our Memtal Body.
1,Mere description is not poetry,"Sure, it is excellently wrought, heavily considered, well-written description. But in the end, it has not moved-- not transformed-- not gone anywhere. That is boring, and that is what the Pulitzer people seem to like. It's not enough to be a describer of things. Newspapers and other media already do that very well. To be a poet, you've got to go somewhere, be something. Pure boredom in this book."
1,Agree with previous one star,"Glad to hear I'm not the only one who wasn't at all impressed with this book. There were exactly three poems in the book that I thought worth reading. The others just ramble on and on without saying or doing anything new or interesting - complete waste of time. I haven't read his other books, so I'm not sure whether he just forgot to edit these poems, or if all his poems read this way."
4,tastes good,"Only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5, is the cost seems rather high given what you receive."
2,What are the REAL ingredients,On the main page this item says it has .9 (that's point 9) grams of fat. Then open the nutrition info and it says 11gm of fat. Whats real? BIG difference! Are the other numbers screwed up also??? Makes you wonder.
2,"Good taste, but expensive.","I have no complaint about the bar themselves, but they are too expensive for what you get."
5,"Delicious, but expensive.",These fruit and nut bars taste amazing and they are addicting to eat. It is a nice snack in-between class or work and gives u energy. Best of all its natural ingredients!Con: it is super expensive for 8 bars for 10.10$ with subscribe and save.
1,No Closed captioning,The Deaf community needs to be aware there is no closed captioning or Subtitles for the Deaf and hard of hearing!
2,DISAPPOINTED,Night Court is a good show good actors and good writers but when I bought Season 4 dvd from Warner Store I was very disappointed when I watch 1 epsoide and there is no Closed Captioned or no English subtiles either as Im hearing impaired then I turn it off right away. But Season 1 thru 3 they are closed capitioned and but Season 4 dvd is not closed captioned or no English subtiles.I guess I will have to sell this Season 4 to Dvd Store cannot do it without CC. Im very disappointed.
5,no problems,"i was a little leary about buying this product given the bad reviews and the problems associated with the early releases of this product. now that i have recieved and viewed this I can confirm that all those problems were fixed, the audio video sync is matched up and the episode titles on the disc do correspond to the episodes on the disc. So everything is fine!"
4,Night Court the complete fourth season,Contents are excellent but since it is a copy some of the quality is lacking. Would definitely recommend to any one who enjoys the Night Court series.
2,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Just like Cheers; I thought it was much better and remembered it as such. Guess I was younger then and laughed at silly stupid things cause I was ""young"" at the time."
4,great show,I always liked this show..use to stay up late to watch the reruns on t.v. truly one of the 80's best..
5,Night Court: Season 4,This was a good TV show. It is good to go back in time to see this show. Thanks for this DVD
3,DVR Release,"The quality of the Season Four release is much poorer than the previous seasons, since it is a DVR, and not a Glass Mask version. Still it's Night Court, hopefully future releases will be real DVD's and not ""Bootlegs"" (Not really a bootleg but of similar quality)."
4,Harry and Dan,"The audio quality on this set was not up to par but I would still buy it again. Just have the remote handy for the numerous times you will have to turn it up and within seconds have to turn it back down.Being a huge Night Court fan, I am not so patiently awaiting season 5..."
3,a step down from previous 3 seasons,"The show is still good, but, in this season, it seems to have become more about Dan and his sex life, with the other characters given less emphasis. I believe the first 3 seasons were richer and funnier than this one."
3,Disappointing for a great series.,"The fourth season was not treated very well by those who made this DVD. There are no sub-titles or close captioning for this season. The quality isn't as high as the first three seasons. It appears that in attempt to protect this season from being copied, they sacrificed quality. The series itself is of course great. This is really good television."
4,Good story,Meagan Good is a great actress. The story this movie is tell is worth seeing and listening to mistakes are made in life
1,movie,Not what I expected not very good wish I didn't order it cover and info misleading movie very very confusing
1,Low Budget and Boring,"I also had a free Redbox code and decided to rent this movie. This is probably the most low budget film I've ever seen. Additionally, the lighting was terrible and the acting was sub-par. I fell asleep after 20 minutes."
5,At Last - Arabic Music with a Western Angle,"I just received this CD and immediately played it.WOW! At last, Arabic music from a westerner's perspective.I live in Dubai, and have become annoyed by all the Lebo-pop we hear. This CD actually explores Arabic instruments in what I can only describe as 'emotional soundscapes'.Pretentious I know, but difficult to describe in other words.The artist is creating music in a similar vein to Roger Waters during his 'Floyd days. A sort of Dark Side of the Moon meets Lawrence of Arabia!! Final Note: Haunting, beautiful, and unusual (to the western ear).BUY IT!!"
2,Not the best,"I was hopeing to get a CD with a bit more upbeat, dance type music but it is more slow, and I thought, rather boring. I tried playing it through a couple times (sometimes after the second or third time a CD will grow on me) but this one just didn't hold my interest enough to want to keep it."
1,Not moroccan,I've sat in La mamounia in Marakech and listened to the music wishing i had in on cd. I stumbled upon this over produced massage music hoping to hear a reminder and was dissapointed.The music and beats screaming from the souks and the square are still in my head.This cd will not be purchased by me.But however if you wanna sleep this is good.
3,Moroccan Spirit,Moroccan SpiritI ordered this for bellydance practice but found that it pleasant to listen to at othet times when I want to relax.
3,Soothing... well... for the most part...,This album is absolutely fantastic. If you have a flavor for Moroccan music you'll love it. The only reason I dislike this album is because it has lyrics in a couple of songs whereas I was hoping for an album with no singing. It's beautiful singing nonetheless.
3,good tracks,"I bought this cd purely for track 2. But the rest of the album is worth listening to. In fact when I am in the mood, I will only listen to track 2 and 4. They are mellow, and lovely for slow ATS."
4,A whole new world of music,"I have always felt Moroccan music was atonal, uncomplicated and, yes, boring. This CD surprised me. Not only by the technical perfection of the performance and the recording, but also by the sometimes haunting, sometimes blood boiling music itself. For people who want to take a chance on something different, this one will easily get into your soul. It has opened up a whole new avenue of music for me."
5,Extremely Powerful And Spirit Moving Music,"As I write this review I am listening to track 10. This is, in my opinion, the most powerful peice on the CD. Track 10 mentally places me in a canoe that is travelling down a gentle stream in the rain forest deep in the Amazon Basin while sunlight pierces through the canopies of the trees and the sounds of the millions of different rain forest speices chime together giving me that earth moving natural high. Track 12 is also very moving too. Moreover, I really enjoy listening to this CD."
5,dance and smooth times,This is not my normal style of music to listen to but i certainly have been enjoying it. It's got some good songs. I let it play out and don't need to skip any. It's good music.
5,Having fun learning,"Spanish ScrabbleI teach high school Spanish. I use this game (among others) with my students on periodic ""game days."" High schoolers LOVE to play games. This is a super game for expanding Spanish vocabulary. I let my students use a dictionary. It is difficult to play unless you have a good vocabulary in Spanish, so allowing English words too is a good idea. Just count all Spanish words for double points after all special point values have already been added too."
5,Remember this is really a challenge in any language!,"I am bilingual and bought this game for my mother. We were told that she has beginning stages of Alzheimer's. Well I think the doctors are wrong but just in case I got this for her.Words games do stimulate synaptic links and activate the language center in the brain.About the comment that this game is difficult in Spanish: The game is not easily in any language!Also, keep in mind that Spanish due to its strong metaphorical constructs have many ways of expressing similar things. The poetry and imagery expressed in Spanish literature is quite powerfull.Just have fun, learn and reinforce! :)"
3,smaller than expected,i chose this product to turn it into something else. the board seems smaller than a normal scrabble board. but it's still usable.
5,Favorite board game.,"It is very entertaining, I would say is more for adults than for children, as it is a fairly serious game, also is maximum for four people so if the family is large is not advisable."
5,Excellent game!,My grandmother does not speak English so this was a gift for her. She loves crossword puzzles so I thought this might be a good game for her. She is addicted! It's so nice to find something for non-English speakers. I wholeheartedly recommend this game.
1,Misadvertised,"The bracelet is not 8"" and it does not look like the picture that is shown. Those looking for an 8"" bracelet beware - I measured it and it is 7""."
4,Speedo Women's Quantum Splice Solid Swim Suit,"This suit is a good quality suit. I've used Speedo brand swim suits for eleven years now, and I have found them to last well through recreactional swimming. Also, these suits are able to handle about two seasons of indoor competitive swimming, or more, depending on the chlorine levels and how well one takes care of the suit. So far, my new Quantum Splice has held up very well in the highly chlorinated pools in which I swim. I recommend this suit-- the price is so much less here than any I could find at a brick & mortar store."
4,Speedo Fit and Quality,This is my 4th suit of the same style and make. It works well for me as I swim laps. It has good coverage and holds up pretty well. I swim about 4 times a week and I get about 4 to 5 months out of a suit due to the cholorine.
2,Suit was too small,"Suit was too small, not enough information available on the site for it. I called Amazon, but even the customer representative was not sure the size. I bought the suit as he suggested, but it is too small."
3,Sizing is off,"Good quality swimsuit, but the size is definetely too small. You should buy a size or two larger than what you would normally wear."
5,Bonhoeffer's meditations,"My Soul Finds Rest is one of Bonhoeffer's best meditations on scripture. Even though this book is older, I have always found Edwin Robertson to be a excellent translator, putting Bonhoeffer's words into understandable English. Bonhoeffer is a very insightful writer, always bringing new thoughts and interpretations to the scriptures. Psalms were among Bonhoeffer's favorite scriptures and he read them every day. The book includes meditations from many different times and places Bonhoeffer served during his life, so the reader can see the thoughts and changes over the years. Robertson provides good commentary on the changes that were occurring. The only part I did not care for in this book were a couple of places where Robertson told us what was going on in Bonhoeffer's life at the time or wrote his own thoughts without providing Bonhoeffer's own thoughts or poetry. I especially enjoyed the chapter that included Psalms 54 and 34."
1,Not recommend,This product was moldy when I received it. Well packaged but not able to try it. Would not recommend it.
5,Great classic game!,Bought this for my little brother in laws (family of 9) and they love it! I remember playing this when I was little and it's such a fun game that you can play with lots of people (not like those games where you can only have 3-4 players). They are ages 9 and up and able to understand and have fun with this game easily. It's also a great educational game since you use numbers and have to think to get the best score.
5,Classic for a reason!,"Yahtzee is a classic game for a reason. It is lots of fun, it is simple to play, the rules are easy to follow. In fact, all you need is five dice and the game sheets. The little cup and yellow counters are just 'dressing' on the side.This game is played by shaking five dice and trying to get points in each roll. You get points by collecting five of the same kind of dice (five fives for example), a full house, counting all the ones you earned etc. Each time it is your turn you get the opportunity to decide how you will work towards getting the most points possible.This game requires the ability to add, to think logically, to enjoy yourself. If you can roll the dice, get five of the same number you may find yourself shouting 'yahtzee'!Well worth the money.Enjoy."
5,A game the whole family will enjoy!!!,"This action-packed, high intensity, role-of-the dice thriller will leave you breathless; it will leave you shocked; and it may boggle your mind when you find out that your opponent(s) just beat you by one point during their final turn. This game is a game of luck; it's a game of skill; and it's a game of chance. The suspense that builds inside you everytime you roll the dice is overwhelming. Nobody knows what the dice will read once they leave the cup. I recommend this game to the entire family. The emotion that is felt during the play of the game is one that you'll want repeated over and over. This is why Yahtzee is my number one favorite game of all time."
4,This game is a classic!,"There are actually people out there who haven't played YAHTZEE? In the USA? It's almost hard to believe because this is such a classic in my family. I think this is our third set. Eventually the game does get a little shabby and it is nice to have a new one. It's pretty simple -- 5 regular dice, a cup to shake them up in, a pencil, and score pads. Score pads can be purchased separately. The idea is to get the highest score by filling in points on the scoresheet -- one box each turn -- in categories like Full House, Small Straight, Three of a Kind. Sounds like Poker or some other card game? It is a lot like that. We've been playing it since the kids were little and now they are well into adulthood. It can be educational if you take the time to talk to your kids about the odds of getting a particular set of dice and how to decide which dice to re-roll. Not a lecture, please -- just a comment now and then!"
5,Such a fun game for all ages,"This game is so much fun for everyone of any age. I have taught my then-4 year old to play, and she loved it. This game is timeless, and easy to learn. We play this at family holidays, and it's the only one we all enjoy. I will be playing this game in years to come."
5,The classic game of Yahtzee,Great game...I have played this game since the 1970s. It's still fun and easy to play...and many ages can enjoy it...
4,Yahtzee review,It is standard yahtzee game so not much to it other than the dice and scoressheets.It is what I expected.
5,Yahtsee Please!,"Omigod,I loved this game when I was little!I cant remember how to play it noe though.You dont need the boxed version though..just pencil,paper and 5 dice."
3,Yahtzee Game,"This is an old school game that enjoyable for the family, however the cheap way they make these games nowadays, is just plain cheap..!!"
5,Really addictive game everyone should try,I really like this game for its entertainment valus as well as being a little educational in the logical thought and strategy areas.I found lost more info about it at http://www.yahtzee.org.uk
2,Newer Version of Game,"We received the game but it wasn't what we ordered. We ordered the vintage game and received the regular ""cheaply made"" version which we paid $5 more for."
2,Somewhat brutal listening,"Not one of my favorite Costello recordings; nothing here makes my EC Top 50 list. 'London's Brilliant Parade' and 'Favourite Hour' come closest.Other OK cuts include 'Pony St.', 'Sulky Girl', 'Still Too Soon To Know', 'My SciFi Twin', 'Just About Glad' and 'All the Rage'. If you must procure 'Brutal Youth' to complete your Elvis collection, try to pick it up used for $5 or so."
3,Not quite a return to form,"With a sound reminiscent of Costello's work from the early 80's, BRUTAL YOUTH just misses the level of his better material. By using the Attractions (w/Nick Lowe in place of Bruce Thomas on many cuts) Costello reaches back for a sound; a sound that he doesn't completely capture. The songs are often clever without the depth of passion that a listener comes to expect from Costello and the music, while solid, seems just too busy to capture the attention. There are cuts worth hearing (""20% Amnesia,"" ""This Is Hell,"" ""Rocking Horse Road"") but the misses (""My Science Fiction Twin, ""Sulky Girl"") are just as common. Not a bad CD, just disappointing.(This review is based on the original release.)"
5,Brutal Youth ~ Elvis Costello,Brutal Youth is a very nice from one of the vocalist with most unique vocals in the business. The book-let is a shoddy piece of work with no lyrics or text in it. The cover photo is photo of two young boys and I have no idea what it is supposed to indicate. The music is nice and sounds just like what one expects from Costello. He writes strange but nice lyrics to semi advantgarde music. The glasses that he wears on this album are atrocious and hopefully he has gotten lasic or bought a pair nicer.
2,A step backwards,"I recently dug this one out of my Cd collection. Being a pretty big Costello fan, I decided to give this one another shot. However, nothing on this album is appealing at all. I finished listening to the cd about 20 minutes ago, and I don't really recall 1 song of the album. This cd just seemed very forced. The writing is overdone as is the production which is quite poor. I feel that Costello was going backwards at this point trying to recreate his old sound which almost never works. Fortunately, he made up for this one big time with Painted From Memory.Brutal Youth, Mighty Like a Rose, and that one before King of America (Goodbye Cruel World) are easily Costello's 3 worst.If you are new to Costello and have heard all the ""famous"" cds, try Trust or King of America to get a better feel where the lyrics and music aren't so forced as on this flat out bad album."
4,An Undervalued Gem,"Though this 1994 ""reunion"" album often draws unflattering comparisons to early EC&A releases, the energy and songcraft present in Brutal Youth make it one of the finest rock&roll albums of the 90s. ""Kinder Murder"", ""20% Amnesia"", and ""All The Rage"" rank near the top of Costello's long list of brilliant songs."
5,Back in Style,"Costello and the Attractions play together for the first time in eight years. The album is pulled off flawlessly. Standout songs include; ""You Tripped at Every Step"", ""This is Hell"", & ""Rocking Horse Road"""
4,One of their best,"A very underrated album, in fact perhaps the most underrated album ever. Often criticised for not ""rocking"" as hard as II or IV, this one succeeds because of another quality: its mystical Celtic-summer vibe. ""The Song Remains the Same"", ""Over the Hills and Far Away"" and ""Dancing Days"" are anthems of exotic fantasy hard-rock, and still sound refreshing today. ""The Rain Song"" is a delightful guitar piece, and ""No Quarter"" is powerful. The only really regrettable track here is the awful ""Crunge"", but the rest showcases Zeppelin's versatility and power very well."
3,Didn't Meet My Standards,"I own Led Zeppelin 1-4, Coda, Physical Graffiti, Houses of the Holy, and In Through the Out Door, so don't disqualify my opinion as one of a ""know-nothing rap fan"". I bought this album expecting the same greatness as the others. It turned out to be the biggest disappointment I've had in music I've purchased since I bought In Through the Out Door. It didn't feel like rock, let alone Led. Granted, there were a few good songs that I really enjoyed like ""Over the Hills and Far Away"", but I felt that over all the lyrics, beat, and over all music wasn't there."
3,Awesome,"I bought this CD for one song: Dancing Days. I had been hearing this song on the Howard Stern show and thought is was an original of some new wave or grunge band. Well wasn't I surprised when I started searching for it and found out it was an Original from LED ZEPPELIN. I'd never heard this from Zeppelin, and the only other song I recognized from the CD was D'yer Mak'er. D'yer Mak'er is the song that was played when I was growing up and listening to FM radio in 1973. Dancing Days has a wonderful beat and Robert Plant's beautiful voice makes it spell-binding. The song gets 5 stars; the CD gets 3."
3,"imagination, something difficult to find","The only problem of Led is that in terms of originality they are pretty poor. Musically they are perfect: with vibatring rithims coming from espetacular bonhan and amazing riffs from Jimmy Page leaving the feeling from the soul to JP Jones and Mr. Plant. However sometimes the feeling is that they are playing on the sames note the whole music, they don't variate oftenly, that causes a lack of quality that is one of the things that differs the real good bands from the common ones. This is the feeling I get when I listen to this Led CD: Lack of originallity."
1,The cover,"I liked Led Zeppelin's first 4 records, so I was interested in buying their fifth until I saw the cover. Am I the only one who sees the cover as kiddie porn? Disgusting, in my humble opinion. Needless to say, I didn't buy it."
2,houses of the holy,"did not purchase this item, so i do not know how it got on my review page. However, i know of this album since i was a kid. i liked led zeppelin. but i never bought this album even in the 70's when it came out. I hate the song ""stairway to Heaven"" it was played one million times since the album came out. It is so worn out and over played.I did purchase Led Zeppelin III and it is an excellent album/c.d."
2,Weak Zep,"I've always been amazed that people laud this album and slag-off on the FAR superior Presence. Not only does this disc hold the two worst Zep tunes: the silly ""The Crunge"" to the HORRID faux-reggae of ""D'yer Mak'r"" ,the rest is mediocre at best. ""The Ocean"" is fluffy filler and only ""No Quarter"" holds any real interest, thanks to Page's fuzzy guitar riff, and even that struggles to hold the song together for it's length."
4,Following up a classic,"After their classic fourth album, anything Led Zeppelin did was going to seem anti-climatic. What they did was come up with a decent set of songs that may not be as trescendent, but are fine judged on their own merit. The best cuts are ""Over the Hills and Far Away,"" ""Dancing Days,"" and the rocking closing track ""The Ocean."" Though it is not their best, it is still a a strong collection of songs."
3,"A Classic, but not the best...","Now, it's a great LZ album,but it, inmy opinion is not the best LZ albumaround,LZ 2 and 3 are somewhat better.But that's just me...I mean while I likeLed Zeppelin well enough i'll take Pink Floyd or Emerson, Lake & Palmer over LZ.Well 2&3 are the exceptions,some people may disagree and I can see why,so I'll leave it at this Good but not the best."
4,Great sounding CD.,"Buy the original version of this, and not the remaster. The RM is too bright. Great album, though."
5,Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart,"Another awesome album by Led Zeppelin. ""The Crunge"" is a bit weak (by their standards), but the other songs are all great. This is hard rock the way God intended it."
4,A COUPLE WEAK LINKS,"I don't like ""The Crunge"" and ""Dancing Days"", but the other songs are pretty good. My favorites are ""The Song Remains the Same"" and ""Over the Hills and Far Away"". I think Physical Graffiti is a better album, but this one is still worth getting."
4,Flawed classic from Zeppelin in their prime,"Some Zeppelin fans are so dumb. That's all I have to say about them. Anyway, this is definitely a classic and is easily placed in the top 5 of their best albums. The biggest problems with it is that you could easily leave off The Crunge and D'yer Mak'er and it would be fine. Their okay songs, though I never listen to the latter, but are kind of misplaced with the whole mood of the album. Another problem that has to do with that is the flow of the album. Going from The Song Remains The Same to The Rain Song doesn't feel right. Instead I think it should have gone to The Ocean or Over The Hills and Far Away. Highlights: No Quarter, Dancing Days, The Rain Song, The Song Remains The Same. Zeppelin were in their prime here and would reach their peak with Physical Graffiti."
4,Loose and Relaxed,"Houses of the holy follows the same path as Led Zeppelin 4, however the approach is looser and much more relaxed.Folky riffs as much as thundering Blues-Rock, giving the album a lighter and more open atmosphere than its 3 predecessors.This is a must in every Led Zeppelin or Classic Rock collector. As a matter of fact the first 6 Led Zeppelin albums are all a MUST."
2,They should have retired back then!,"And saved themselves from the overtly humiliating Physical Graffiti and its follow ups. But who can take such a decision when dollars are raining from the sky, huh?Houses of the Holy is a bad album. When you need a thousand guitar overdubs to spike up some interest in ""The Song Remains the Same"", it's just because your base material sucks. The rest isn't much better either. John Paul Jones, a solid bassist, plays cheesy mellotron strings here -another bad sign. But what the heck, HOTH it might have sounded bad then, but compared to PG it looks like a jewel now!"
5,ZOSO is the only real Zeppelin floater.,"Although nowhere as near as commercially successful as Led Zeppelin IV, this definately has some their greatest hits. Ocean is probably my second favorite Led Zeppelin song(next to Whole Lotta Love). What I love about these later albums is that Robert Plant no longer moans like a woman but he sings like a Viking warrior about to conquer the Newfoundland maincoast. I know you're probably thinking:""is this guy high? what does he mean by whatever he said?"" Robert Plant's voice is what kind of discouraged me from Zeppelin in the first place. In Led Zeppelin II he actually does sing and it sounds absolutely awesome, but in Led Zeppelin IV he sounded like a woman having an orgasm. Its good to see Zeppelin back in working order after the most heinously overated album in history. I especially like Page's evolved guitar work, he still not in the top 10 but he certainly is in the top 25. Overall, Led Zeppelin is a great band, but they are still not the greatest."
4,...this album's wholy great,"I love this album, it took me a while to get into it, but I love it.""The rain song"" is one of my all time favorite Led Zep tracks. Other standout tracks include ""Over the hills and far away"", ""D'yer Mak'er"" and, of course ""No Quarter"".The only song on this album I don't like is ""The crunge"", for some reason everybody loves this song, but I find the lyrics to be tart, and the vocal effect on Robert Plant's voice doesn't seem to fit in with music.All in all this is a excellent album, and I would suggest it to anyone who's into classic rock, or a Led Zeppelin fan."
3,Led Zeppelin always produces good music,"The 4 wild men from the UK are back with another hit. Good music, but not my favorite album. Sample this Zep cd, before buying it. Not as good as LZ 2 and/or LZ 4, but still a solid album."
5,"Great Album, Growing Expierementation From Band","Houses of the Holy is a good album for any mood. A lot of the songs are fun, upbeat and catchy, some of the others are slower for mellower moods, and overall this is a great album. E Produced Zeppelin classics like ""Over The Hills..."", ""Dancing Days"", and my favorite LZ song ""The Ocean""."
2,It was scratched,"The CD I purchased was badly scratched, the playback was terrible, and it was shipped at the end of the waiting period. There was also no distinction from the shipper whether or not the album was the old CD or the newly remastered album."
4,Incomplete Remaster,"It borders on criminal when something is billed as a ""Remaster"" of a certain album and then they leave songs from the original off. On this disappointing CD the title track ""Houses of the Holy"" is missing. What's up with that Jimmy?The WHOLE album would be rated five stars... but since its missing a song, I'll give it four. Seems the song ""Houses of the Holy"" migrated to the next, albeit weaker, Led Zep offering ""Physical Graffiti."" I can see why as PG is ponderous, repetitious, and should have been a single LP when it came out instead of a double.The COMPLETE album (which this remaster is NOT) ""House of the Holy"" is Led Zeppelin's pinnacle... their best. It was all downhill after this baby."
5,One of the BEST ever....Zep at the top,"More from the BEST rock band that ever lived. If you can only buy 3 records buy this one along with Led Zep 4 and Physical Graffitti, you won't be sorry. These are the best the band has to offer. Houses of the Holy just rocks. A more sensitive and slower version of rock and roll blues from the boys we all know. Every song is a classic. It doesn't get any better than this folks, really! A ten star album to cherish for years..."
4,My first Zep experience...,"I dug this one out of my parent's record stack in 7th grade (about 6 years ago) and it more or less got me into Zep. ""The Rain Song"" was always my fav, due to the great Mellotron arrangement, and ""The Song Remains The Same"" is a great kickoff tune (I always imagine a flight over the West Virginian foothills...don't know why). I had read though, that ""The Song Remains"" was supposed to be an instrumental that led into ""The Rain Song"", until Plant came up with some lyrics. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that would have been even better. Oh well. Still a good album and actually a good place to start off for Zep."
4,A Transitional Album,"Like the middle son in a family in which both the elder (Led Zeppelin [IV]) and younger (Physical Graffiti) get all the praise, Led Zeppelin's 1973 album Houses of the Holy is an oft overlooked piece of the collection. But there's no question that the album is strong, piecing together a variety of styles and approaches in what was Zep's first album where they wrote all of the songs, rather than reinterpreting a couple of blues classics.It isn't my ""go to"" Zep album...in fact, it's well down the list. But it is my favorite Zep to spin when I'm feeling like listening to some laid back music."
1,Outgrown It,"I guess that as I get older, this kind of music means less to me. I prefer harmonies, melodies, and good tunes to self-indulgent, over produced mush with bad singing. The relentless pounding of the drums is nauseating."
1,Limp,"This is the weediest pop music I've ever heard. It's pathetic to hear Plant whine ""these are the seasons of emotion"" . I burst out laughing when he sang that. The rest is equally bad. Don't buy this, or any other Led Zep album."
1,Boring,"Hi everyone, just to add to Zeps long list of rip offs, the riff to The Ocean is taken from an old medieval tune, Dum Pater Familias."
1,Not So Great Hippie Rock,"I hate this band, why don't they just fade away. This music is no longer in style, thank gawd, so why do they keep putting this garbage out?? The singer whines like a hippie on a bad trip, the guitar playa only does 2 cords, the bass player has a funny vest, and the drummer is so lazy he just hits the bass drum over and over. ""The Crunge"" has some of the dumbest sounding musik I've ever heard, and the other songs drag on far too long. ""No Quarter"" is the worst of 'em all. I hate this!! Stick with korn, linkin park, limp bizkit, staind, kid rokk, fall out boy, my chemical romance, dashbord confessional, taking back sunday and death cab for cutie if you want REAL music. Go Bengals, they are football's champs!! Carson Palmer and Chad Johnson are tru MVP's of football!!"
1,Misrepresented condition,"Description of album was in ""very good shape with some wear to the cover. Album was dirty, had a scratch through song 1 side 1 and was so worn it was unplayable due to scratching sound overpowering the music ( note I am not that picky I own 100's of vinyl albums) I did get a full refund, so thank you for standing behind the item."
5,One of the best ever!,This is one of the all time best ever! I wish more groups made records with more than one hit one them. This is hit after hit that can be played from beginning to end over and over again.
4,I give it 4.5,"I absolutely love this. The only reason why I give this album 4.5 starts instead of 5 is because the song ""The Crunge"" is fairly annoying. Besides that, the album is amazing. This album sees Led Zep take a turn from their heavy rock into other different styles. This experimenting turns out to be very interesting indeed (except for ""The Crunge"")."
5,No need to worry,"Worried about buying Houses because you have heard ""it doesn't rock"" and you don't hear much about this album? Well, you don't hear much about it because it is nestled between Zoso and Physical Graffiti, but this album is amazing. If Led had added 3 or 4 more tracks to this album it could have been their best. Every song with the exception of ""The Crunge"" is inspired. Other point: this album does rock, Over the Hills and Far Away definetely has an edge as does the funky Bonham driven ""The Ocean"". The Song Remains the Same is also a great song, a bit dreamy. The Rain Song is beautiful. If you get to like it go buy ""The Song Remains the Same""-it has a great live version. Peace out."
5,Great- Nothing More to Say,Houses of the Holy is one of my favorite Led Zeppelin Albums close behind Led Zeppelin II. There is nothing on this album not to like. The Song Remains the Same is great. The Rain Song is one of those special Zeppelin songs. Over The Hills and Far Away leads in with a slow intro and then gets your head banging. The Crunge is pure headbanging. Dancing Days is a song that you can't not love. D'yer Make'er a Reggae song will make you laugh at first but you will fall in love with it. No Quarter and The Ocean round out this album and are great songs.
4,Houses of the Holy,"I bought this Album for my son for his birthday. I ordered it late, only a couple of days before and never thought it would have arrived before his birthday a week or so earlier than promised. Thank-you for the great service and and for the great description of the album. It was in great shape and arrived nicely packaged."
5,Hollie's voice and Steve's lyrics - SENSATIONAL!,"I've loved Steve McDonald's works for years, but Hollie adds a whole new dimension to them with her haunting voice...listen to Amazing Grace just once...you'll never forget it! Fields of Athenby is also poignant. When listening to this album you forget that the voice is that of a teenager...her voice and talent is ageless."
5,More Please,"I was in a Craft Shop while vacationing in Bermuda when I first heard this music playing in the background. I loved it instantly. When I came home I immediatly went to Amazon to purchase. That was two years ago and I am waiting for Hollie's next CD. Please Hollie, bless us with another CD."
5,The voice (and face) of an angel...,"I'll keep this short... Sunday's singer Harriet Wheeler's voice has been compared to an angel more often than I can count. Well... that's because it's true. If you're a fan of beauty and music, then pick up all three Sundays' albums."
4,Ethereal,"I have been listening to this album for about 10 years. It's a great debut album and I think it's the best from the Sundays! ""Here's Where the Story Ends"" is the song that made me purchase Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic, and is one of the best songs on the album, but it's ""I Kicked a Boy"" and ""Skin and Bones"" that really gives the album character. As singer/songwriters the Sundays contribute British pop and a 1960's feel. They are modern day, edgy folk singers. They use enough electric guitar to give it kick, but at the same time, the lyrics are soft, making an eclectic mix. It's not kiddie pop, and it is certainly not elevator music! There is simply a serenity that comes from listening to the Sundays. It makes me want to run across the English countryside!"
5,My New Favorite CD!,"I rarely give an album 5 stars, but this one deserves it! This is the band and the CD that paved the way for other great groups such as The Cranberries and The Cardigans. The airy vocals and guitar express a surprising range of emotions when coupled with the intelligent and thought-provoking lyrics. Highlights include ""Here's Where The Story Ends"", the fast-paced ""Hideous Towns"", the different vocal styles and rocking riffs on ""A Certain Someone"", and the surreal but beautiful ""Joy"". A must for any collection!"
2,All in all I was dissappointed...,"The only song I really liked on this album was ""Heres where(the story ends)."" I thought the cd would have a lot better songs on it but they were kind of boring:( There were a few exceptional songs but overall the cd was pretty crappy!"
5,Finest non-fictional work on Africa in a generation,"For anyone interested in Africa's trials and tribulations during the previous century this volume must be the number one must-read. It is both an eye-witness account of apocalyptic events in Somalia and Rwanda and a moving personal story of love, loss and adventure in the line of fire. Hartley manages to keep a morass of complex storylines together without a dull page and without losing the reader. Beautifully written with gut-wrenching honesty and very strongly recommended."
5,The Zanzibar Chest by Aidan Hartley,"An extraordinary book. Compelling, horrifying, hear-warming, evocative of Africa at its best and worst. Anyone who loves the continent should read it. They won't be bored for one second! I am amazed how well Hartley is able to recount recollections, & the emotions which went with them, from so long ago. It reminds me of ""Speak Swahili, Dammit!"" by James Penhaligon, the true story of a Cornish boy growing up in the bush in Tanganyika, later Tanzania (published March 2010). There's a book trailer under that title on youtube, with original old cine-film from the bush. These two authors & lovers of Africa should get together!Speak Swahili, Dammit !"
5,Very Special,"Every once in a while you read a book that you can't stop thinking about when you are finished with it. This is one of those books. I'd like thank Aidan Hartley for putting it all to paper. I have been to those places, but have never been able to explain it to family and friends. Now Mr. Hartley can do it for me. Again, thanks."
2,Too big a subject for the author,"I got to page 50. Why I quit? I still couldn't tell by that page what the book was about. I could very well guess that the author wanted to talk about his family history, his father in particular, but also about Africa, Arabia, and -it seems- it could encompass the whole wide world.A lot of passion, though. I believe this is what most readers detect in the reviews. And that is good. A writer has to put his heart into his story. But if you don't have your ideas clear on how to organize all that material, and if you're not a really good story-teller you're in for trouble.A pity. I am sure there are plenty of good stories to tell here. But I didn't want to break my brains tracking all the locations, times, and characters that mingle chaotically in this narrative. Too much too tell and not enough know-how to do it."
1,Don't waste your money,Got this reel for my four year old son. Thought it would be exciting to view all the mean JP dinosaurs. It turned out to have more slides of actors and action scenes than anything. Very disappointed.
5,"Motorcycles, alcohol, drugs & thugs . . . classic ""Gonzo"" journalism","I was a young, impressionable 18-year-old high school senior in upstate New York in 1970 when I read Hunter Thompson's first book, ""Hell's Angels,"" and was totally blown away by his first person, in-your-face, stream-of-consciousness ""Gonzo"" writing style. It was absolutely incredible to me. His unique writing style combined with a fearless attitude toward actually living and riding and learning the truth about this outrageous band of motorcycle outlaws produced an incredible look at the seamier, lawless side of life. And, of course, the alcohol and drugs and high-powered Harleys and thugs and ex-cons who eventually beat the crap out of him also added a real-life luster and dimension that Thompson captured so brilliantly in this amazing classic."
4,The Growl of Old Uncle Harvey,"How the great Hunter Thompson survived the numerous tribal romps detailed in this novel is an astounding attestment to the author's adaptability despite his masculine and gonzo-eyed presence. While there is sure to be a hint of exagerration due to Thompson's Dali-like warped view of the content in front of his eyes, what he captures is sure entertaining and really transports the reader to that moment in time.While not as saucy and subserviently humorous as some of his better tales, this two year existence on the road with one of the most dangerous sub-cultures to existent in 20th century Western Culture, is a delightful study. The character's images, personality, excursions, and lifestyle are greatly conveyed through the colorful descriptions of Thompson. In addition, the confusing disorganization and initial fragementation of each Angels group is described, with future recklessness and dissolution portended (i.e. Altamount). Cheers Hunter"
4,Nice.,"There isn't much here to learn about the Hell's Angels if you're already familiar with them. If you're not familiar with them, and you want to learn about them, just about any other Hell's Angels book will tell you as much. The difference is in the storyteller. Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson. Usually when you read or hear something like this, you're told by some raving pompous reporter, reminiscent of Robert Downey Jr.'s character in Natural Born Killers who tries to hit hard and scare you. Thompson plays it cool with his usual wit and insight. That's what makes this book worth a read. Thompson understood the Hell's Angels. He road with them, made friends. From Thompson, you always read the truth in its truest form you can read. What he found through his adventures with them made for what was indeed a strange and terrible saga."
2,Not a fan,"My review might be slightly bias because I'm not a huge fan of the author. I can't ""get into"" his style of writing. I purchased this book and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and was unable to finish either book. The first time I have ever broken my ""always finish the book"" rule. I felt, in some cases, he was too wordy and that it didn't add to the mental picture I was creating in my head as I read. I would definitely preview this work before purchasing to make sure that you like his style."
2,Well..,"This book was interesting, but I was a little disappointed that it had less of Thompson's signature voice of insanity, and was more of a detached piece of journalism on the Angels. There was a good angle about the media frenzy that unfairly characterized the bikers as maniacs, and a lot of investigative journalism that almost nobody else would have been crazy enough to undergo, but those people looking for a colorful Thompson memoir should look elsewhere in his catalogue. They can read about the Angels on Wikipedia."
3,Where's the pictures?,"I first read this back in Jr High, a million years ago and miles away. My book had tons of photos. Where are all of those pictures?"
4,Decent,"This is not an earth-shattering book, but somehow Hunter's books got by me while I was in medical school, and I wanted to find out what this Gonzo journalism was all about. It seems I made the wrong choice, since HT did not start the Gonzo business before he wrote this book. (Being stubborn, I proceeded to order his Vegas book and got my answer.)However, there's nothing wrong with his Hell's Angels work, except that at times it becomes boring. Actually I think I found some Gonzoism in it, but apparently I wasn't supposed to. He did place himself in the story, but not to the degree that his Kentucky Derby article did. In fact, I could have stopped with the latter and would not have had to pay for two books. But what the hell, I suppose his money goes somewhere, hopefully to the betterment of us all."
5,There's a reason....,There's a reason Thompson is such a respected writer. This is gonzo at its finest. Thompson takes us to the very heart of an exclusive crew and gives us a reasonably objective and interesting view. 5/5.
4,Huntter the king,great book.It changed my view about Hells Angels.I didn't know much about them nor did I had any interst in geting to know them.But after I read it I was glad I did.I have more respect about for them they had some fun time back then and Hunter tells u all about it.
1,Hell's Angels,"Hell's Angels is boring, boring, boring unless you enjoy reading lots of statistics. If you're really curious about how many motorcycles were registered in the U.S. in 1965, this might be the book for you. On occasion there is a paragraph or page that has some meat in it and then it's back to numbers. After all the hype I'd read about Hunter S. Thompson, I expected to read the 1970's version of ""On the Road."" One thing for sure Thompson is no Kerouac."
1,BIG BLUFF,"If you're expecting an introspective study of a complete infiltrate on the Hell's Angels day to day, forget about it, this is basicly the report of two big reunions of the Angels in the early 60's, with some articles of the time. And ONLY till that date, no further. TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTING. Tedious, boring, in fact didn't finished it."
3,Period Piece,"It's not that much about the Hell's Angels, it's about a lot of other motorcycle gangs too. Some good historical California and Oakland stuff. It's for HST fans, for sure, and I'm one. It's a ""road story"" in a lot of ways, and I like that. HSY at his best? Maybe. But not as gonzo as some. Probably not the best place to start with either HST or the Angels. But good."
4,Year in the life of the Hell's Angels,"This was HST's first book after doing free lance journalism almost everywhere. It does not have his wit and style of his later works, but still offers insight and his interpretations of everything. How many writers, authors, and journalists would actually hang out with this group of ""bikers"" for a year? He did and lived to tell about it (barely), but some of it is redundant. It is not a bad book and HST's account of this year of his life makes for good reading and you don't want to put it down, because you want to know what happens next."
3,not the best place to start,"I read this book years ago. It was the first HST book I read and if you're new to his writings and new to his style, as your lawyer I would advise you not to start here. Don't get me wrong - it's a great book, however you need to be interested in the topic.This is the book that began the reign of gonzo journalism. Written in 1966, Hunter does a great job of relaying his exploits as he is allowed to co-mingle with the members of the Hell's Angels. He does a nice job of telling their histroy, the importance of Harley's and how these men are real men - not devils. Well.... maybe a few of them.Although the book is basically dated, if you want to know more about the ""outlaw"" biking culture this is a great read. If you're just getting into HST you should try FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS and I'm sure you won't stop from there."
3,Interesting to a point,"If you're a fan of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, don't expect to find that same genius in Hell's Angels. Not that it's a bad book. It isn't. Some of the sordid activity of the Hell's Angels is quite an interesting read... but at other points in the book I found myself skimming, i.e. the descriptions of the cycles, etc. However, one thing I really admire about the book is it's sheer objectivity. Thompson neither loves nor hates the Angels. He obviously shows contempt for some of their loutish and criminal/psychopathic behavior, but also distinguishes them as misfits looking for a home. If you're looking for an expose on biker gangs that would reflect their modern dimensions, obviously this book wouldn't be for you, but as a history lesson in outlaws it has strong merits."
5,Hell's Angels: A Strange and Terrible Saga,"I didn't love it (I didn't read it), but it is on my grandson's Christmas list. I'll let you know when he's finished reading....."
3,Good read,Good fast read? The origins of this group is illuminated in this book. One can see the time frame for this book.
1,Gonzo Boingo Baddo Booko,"Everyone else can applaud this Hunter Thompson if they want. I read this book with no preconceived notion regarding its author, and I can state with no hesitancy that it reads as little more than a star-struck tribute. Mr. Thompson takes great pains to show how misunderstood these fellows are, and how a few random rapes and assaults are misportrayed by the multitudes of journalists who are less insightful than he. Although the Hell's Angels are outdated and tame by today's Crip and Blood standards, there remains a chilling message: bad people exist and bad sycophantic writers exist to worship them."
3,Does he ride like he writes?,"From what I know, Hunter Thompson is a great author but this must not have been his best work. He drag's something simple out for what seems to be days and yet he seems to summarize the events that actually lasted for days. The book has alot of references to outside material and it almost seems like he is writing it from an outsiders view sometimes. This book only documents a years time and that leaves alot of the Angel's history left untold. If you've read everything else on the Angel's then go for it otherwise finish the rest first."
3,ok/but slow,"The book had some exiting parts in it ,but he always seemed to not be there for the real deal.Read bargers book for the indepth stuff to bad barger and thompson could not of got together and wrote a book,bargers storys and thompsons writing skills would have been a killer book.RIDE ON BRO'S Bradski"
3,"Pretty good book, but...","Hell's Angels is an in depth look into the lives of the motorcycle gang, delivered by Mr. Gonzo Journalism himself. Seems like a formula for success, right?The problem is, nothing really happens. There's a lot of build up to the 4 or 5 exciting parts, but mostly these guys seem to just sit in bars and posture.I love Hunter S. Thompson, but unless you're already a die hard fan, you might want to start with either Fear and Loathing or Rum Diary before you tackle this one."
3,Not enough Hunter,"""Hell's Angels"" lacks some of the personal edge and Gonzo reporting style that I expect from Thompson. It is fun in parts, but overall it's too objective. After a few chapters, I found myself thinking, ""I get it, these guys are burnouts and misfits, and I don't need be told any more minor stories about their antics."" I can't be satisfied with this book as a piece of historical journalism either because there is so much post-1966 Hell's Angels history. Altamont and other important events occurred after the book was written, so I feel like I still don't have a good handle on the Hell's Angels' full significance in American culture. The thing I will remember the most from the book is the quote by Samuel Johnson, ""He who makes himself a beast gets rid of the pain of being a man."" This quote succinctly describes a core motivation of the Hell's Angels and others who know the pleasure of fringe lifestyles and behavior."
5,Hells Angels: a hard to find modern classic.,"A very high quality production run, hard-bound with illustrated dust jacket etc. of a very hard to find modern classic. Read Thompson as he was before he became a cartoon character like caricature. Succinct and insightful with the acerbic wit front and centre where it belongs. A cracking good read ! Excellent value too in this Modern Libraries edition. Why pay all-kinds of stoopid money on E-bay for a dog-eared paperback when you can have this for little more than the price of lunch for one alone."
4,Worth it the cost,"This was a very informative book. Mixes the historical information of the Hell's Angels (and other motorcycle groups), with enough details of their activities to keep the reader interested. Very descriptive, made you want to take a shower to wash all the grease and testosterone off you after each reading. Captured the attitude of the times very well. Couple parts where it got a little graphic, but rang true. Would have liked to have had more recent information on the subject, but understand this book was written some time ago. Seemed to be a very accurate depiction (balanced) on all sides; the motorcycle gangs, the attitudes of the general public and the authorities and how they interacted and were perceived."
5,Memorable,"I read this book probably twenty years ago and it definitely made an impression. He calls a group of drifters that moved west a humorous name (Sneads?) and links it to the attitude of the Hell's Angels. I always remembered that, just not the actual name. The ending is quite poetical. Also the confrontation with locals during a bike run sticks in my mind."
3,"OK, but could've been better","a lot of rambling and when talking about a specific ""RUN"" or event, 1/2 way through the story he tangents off into another story that the author feels is somehow related and has nothing to do with the club or motorcycles. sometimes these ""other stories"" has somewhat of a connection just different context, but most of the time, it feels like what is the point. additionally, when author is off on these tangents, he doesn't complete the original Hell's Angels story he began in full detail of all the events that occured on that particular ""RUN"". found book interesting, but frustrating at the same time. could of been so much more than it is..."
1,I Don't Like This Book,"Unless you are the type of person who enjoys bullying, physical intimidation and domination you will find this book disturbing. That's fine and all, but I simply cannot get it out of my head that this writer practically worships the ground these cretins walk on. Episode after episode of criminal behavior is explained away as if it's just a ""boys will be boys"" kind of deal. You get the idea that the writer has some repressed fantasy that he is living out when he is among these motorcycle toughs. I bet the writer thinks the current gangs and the Mafia are also cool."
1,"Moderately entertaining at times, but always UNTRUE!","Having spent a considerable amount of time with several of the Hell's Angels written about in this book, I can say without any hesitation that Mr. Thompson has misrepresented some basic facts. While it is often expedient for the sake of the story to have these Hell's Angels consistently dull, boorish and intimidating, the journalist must -- repeat must -- remain true to the facts. The Hell's Angels of this era also had a sentimental and altruistic side that Mr. Thompson chose to overlook. Now, having said that, I concede that Mr. Thompson has created a mildly interesting world of good guys and bad guys. This book should be classified as a work of fiction, however."
1,very boring,Reads like a boring book report that is full of propoganda. Waste of time. Stopped less than halfway in. I kept waiting for it to get interesting. Unfortunately it never did
3,"Hell of a man,shame about the book","Anyone looking for the same trippy magic carpet ride found in 'Fear and Loathing...' beware: Hunter S. gets a lil' bit serious in this socio-historical ride with the bad boys. Although much of the information contained in this book is relatively interesting, it somehow lacks that 'oomph' that made 'Fear and Loathing; such a great read"
2,Hell's Angel's is a big yawn.,"If you are looking for the same high calibur, rapid gunfire writing as Fear and Loathing, look elsewhere. I read this book first and thought that it was plainly and intelligently written, but not at all interesting, and I'm glad one of my friends made me read Fear and Loathing because I would have never touched it after having read Hell's Angel's."
1,Total Scam Artist,This book goes by the notion if you and your friends buy x today you should sell it for y two years from now with a huge profit and keep turning over the properties every two to three years till you own a million dollar apartment property in ten years. The worst case of rip-off I've ever seen in a book.
3,Not for beginners,"I am a beginner and a lot of this stuff is over my head. He only focuses on mid-size buildings, and the $6,000 is assuming you're going in with a group, which I wouldn't want to do. Also, he recommends software (from a company of which he is a director) and finding consultants. This would have to add up to spending a lot before you can invest a single dollar. This is basically a book version of a seminar he holds ""Three Moves to a Million."" This approach to me is a little get rich quickish, and I have to wonder how many buildings out there actually fit his mathematical formula; probably not many. I have a feeling he's getting rich these days not through apartment ownership but with seminars and software sales. But still, he's thorough in describing a range of processes and things to consider."
1,A Total Waste of Money,"This book is outdated and incorrect in many cases. The author presents data from the 80's, and no real substance behind his recommendations.I use the criteria of ""one good idea in a book makes it worth reading"". I honestly did not get one idea from this book.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
5,Vollucci is one of the best,"If you want a top notch contemporary, practical guide to the realities of real estate investing, this is the book. Vollucci approaches the game of buying apartment houses from his background of many years as an accountant. He evidently learned from his wealthy clients and has figured out the formulas for identifying suitable locations in which to invest. His explanations are virtually void of hyperbole and he writes in a clear jargon-free manner. In addition to outlining his methods for analyzing markets and regions this book includes sections on syndication, marketing, and strategies for buying and arranging financing. This is not a game for the unsophisticated, but if you do the homework these strategies are the prudent investor's standard fare. Also, his references on how to use consultants and getting computer programs to help with analysis have can save alot of legwork."
1,Out of date,Don<t waist your money on this book. It is out of date (1988). Many of the consepts in the book will not work. Borrowed and read this book from a friend. Wasn't impressed.
1,Gheeeeeeeeeze,"Well, after attending one of his ""investing in rentals"" seminars, some of the information was ok, some vauge, some just absolutley avoided unless you paid the $500 ""member"" fee. What a crock. I think if you could read enough books on real estate, talk to some other people, you could figure out how to do it. it is not rocket science at all, save your money, don't buy the book, go take some classes instead. Real estate can be a frightening subject to many, but think about it, your living in a house or apartment. One other thing, he appeared to be a pushy salesman - be aware"
4,Uri Gofman reviews How to Buy and Sel...,An informative and practical guide to building an ever increasing portfolio of apartment buildings. Good information difficult to find elsewhere.
5,AIRPLANE!,This is the film that launched the series of spoofs about everything!These guys were brilliant in this and the following series.Leslie Nielsen got a new lease on his career and life!
1,Great movie - worthless commentary,"First of all -- the movie itself is outstanding. Classic comedy that has stood the test of time. I don't even have to go into it, I don't think.A lot of people will buy this movie for the director's commentary. It's most entertaining to hear the insides of the jokes, film's evolution, mistakes, etc.This one is not it. Instead you just get a bunch of pompous ""industry"" windbags praising themselves and dropping names. The jokes and bits fly by while they spent nearly the entire time talking about this-agent, this-studio president, all of the fights they had with the guilds, funding issues and other film industry jargon. There's probably about 5 minutes of actual commentary related to the film itself.Bottom line -- these people live in their own world and have completely lost touch with the viewers of the movie. If you are looking for any insight and/or entertainment, and planning to purchase for the commentary -- skip it."
1,"cheap, low humors","I couldn't even watch more than 20 minutes of this movie. The humors are so corny, cheap by today's standard. It's more stupid than funny. Movies like ""office space"", ""groundhog day"" is far better than this one."
4,Clever,"This movie was more clever than laugh-out-loud funny. I snickered rather than laughed at most of the jokes. It is one of the more intelligent spoof movies out there...you need to have some brain cells to appreciate and ""get"" many of the jokes. This movie was made in 1981 I think. So it just goes to show you that a good movie is a good movie regardless of what time it was made in."
4,It's funny but not too funny,"I just bought this movie about a month ago and was able to watch the whole thing again and possibly more and more to come but this movies writing is smart and snappy. I can see some of the comedic inventions from this movie were used in shows like The Simpsons and Family Guy. There are alot of classic scenes in this film and it's definitely an enjoyable watch for all types of ages. Now, how much of movies do you hear that about?"
4,"Are they serious about the release date of this ""airplane"" movie?!","The movie is amazing. I've seen the 1080p version and its main downfall to HD is that you can see the strings on some of the gags (the jumping heart and the famous dance sequence). I don't know if they digitally fixed that in this release, but the content of this film is just timeless. But a 9/11 release date is a really, really bad call, no?"
2,Airplane(don't call me shirley edition),"Don't buy this version unless you've never seen the movie!!! If you've seen the movie , watching this version will bore you to tears and get you sick of the movie. when striker says he's pouring sweat there is a cut out scene. I believe there is a line where trying to remember where he heard the name says striker, striker , striker and slapstick goes on alot. nearly all the funnies are taken out of the movie. Who has the long haul version? as it says on the back of this version? where can I get it. because I definately would give the long haul version all five stars."
5,Airplane DVD,Got this as a Christmas gift for somebody. Came in the mail in a timely fashion and was in perfect condition.
5,Hilarious!,"'Airplane' is perhaps my favorite comedy, right up there with 'Caddy Shack' and 'Sordid Lives'!"
1,Not funny,We did not think the movie should be rated as a good comedy because it was not. We were really disappointed that we had to pay for this one since we did not enjoy it.
2,Too much gags turn the picture boring,"I expected a fun movie but the number of gags are so many and so exagerated that I was bored after thye first half hour.It is not funny, it turned ridiculous!I would not recommend this film to anyone."
2,A long time ago people thought it was funny,"'Airplane' spoofs all those films featuring large passengeraircrafts in big trouble and makes fun of romantic love as well. When I ordered it, I was really looking forward to watching since it features many known comedians. But I was not that much amused... In fact, nowadays I can't get the reason why I ordered it in the first place.My impression may be explained by the following : There is thekind of movie that is only funny the first time you watch it.Then there is the kind which makes you laugh more than once(in most cases, you will watch it again and again). Well, Airplane seems to be in between those two categories. The film is bizarre on first sight (and partially funny). So you want to take a second look because you think you didn't get the point the first time. After all, your friends told you about how great it is. But on second sight, it stops being funny and becomes boring. I can't recommend neither the first part nor the sequel."
1,Stupid,Thos movie was horrid to the point where I could not even sit through it. And I am an immature high school freshman.
4,Still funny after all these years,"It would be fun to write down all the famous movies this one spoofs as you're watching it! Anyway, Airplane is probably the original spoof movie & one of the absolute best. Highly recommended to anyone who hasn't already seen it."
3,Do Call me Shirley,"I've loved this movie ever since it came out. It was made especially popular by the constant airing of HBO (back when there was only one). HBO did the same with The Blues Brothers and Midnight Madness. Anyway.CONS:1. Perhaps there is an Easter egg that you can use in order to see the long haul ""extras"" w/o the movie. Even though I was amazed at the amount of cast members (too bad no julie) it did get annoying after awhile. I agree with others that it is also too bad you can integrate the new scenes back into the movie either like on Terminator 2.2. Same commentary from the earlier released dvd.PROS:1. The amount of cast members brought back for interviews. Lorna is still a hotty.2. I did enjoy the little pop up tidbits. They aren't annoying like the Back to the Future ones are.3. Still an improvement."
5,Outrageously funny,"This is one of the funniest and craziest movies ever made. I enjoy it even more now because much of the dialogue would be considered ""politically incorrect"" if tried today. The scene where Robert Stack beats up several peace activists and hippies at the airport is incredibly funny! The DVD has audio commentary by the 3 directors that I really didn't like. They joked around a little too much, and it was often hard to understand them because they kept talking over each other. Two people should be the maximum for simultaneous audio commentary, just like they do with NFL and baseball games."
2,"Always a good movie, but disc is flawed","Fantastic movie and prompt customer support from Amazon, but the disc is flawed. There's a feature on this disc that allows you to view the video with actor interviews actually inserted into the movie. The problem comes when watching the movie like normal people do... without all that garbage. Everytime the movie would ordinarily cut away to an interview there's approximately a 1 second pause in the playback. Thinking this was just a bad disc I sent it back to Amazon and received prompt customer support. Those folks really go above and beyond. But when they sent the replacement disc I had the same problem. It wasn't until I played both the short (normal) and ""long haul"" (with interviews) versions that I noticed all the skips were in exactly the same place as the inserts. It's incredibly annoying for the first half of the movie or so, but I gradually got used to it. I'll just try not to buy ""special editions"" of 25 year old movies again!"
4,Same master as 'Don't Call Me Shirley' DVD release,"There is nothing new to this release. The same features, menu layout, extras, movie, etc, are all the same as the special edition DVD. It's the same masters used, except this time they ported it onto the sharper Blu-Ray format.If you love the movie, it's worth double-dipping for the video and sound quality. Because that's the only thing that's improved. But if you were wanting more features, deleted scenes cordoned off, the interviews cordoned off (the ""Long Haul"" version felt jarring back with the special release DVD and still does, but at lease you can see all the wrinkles, blemishes, etc, on peoples' faces in crystal clarity.)Right now (early October 2011), the release is exclusive to one retail store (Best Buy). The sticker on the front telling its exclusive status is easily removed, so I suspect it'll be released to far more retailer sources in the future."
4,Airplane,"I watched this for the first time after getting this DVD. I thought it was pretty funny. Good price, decent delivery speed, wasn't harmed during shipping. Would recommend."
5,Love it,I love this old movie and had to have a copy for my collection. There are so many gag things going on you just can't catch them all in one viewing. ...........And stop calling me Shrily!
5,The funniest movie ever!!,"In my opinion, this movie defines comedy! I have watched it over and over again and it never seems to get boring. This story follows a retired air force pilot named Ted Striker, who goes aboard a plane to patch things up with his love Elaine, a hostess on board. The crew members fall ill and it's up to Ted to land the plane! This movie has some hilarious scenes, including a club scene parody of the 70's hit movie ""Saturday Night Fever"". I loved this movie!!"
4,Watch it Twice...,"When you get the DVD, first watch the movie and laugh out loud; then, watch it again, this time with the commentary track on. It is very enlightening and funny in itself... My only quibble is that, in the comments, either Zucker or Abrahams says that the non-US version of the film had an extra 10 minutes of footage (in fact, I remember a very funny scene from that version when it was screened in my Venezuelan hometown 20 years ago.) Why weren't those 10 extra minutes not added here? That's what DVDs are for... This minor complaint aside, ""Airplane"" is one for the ages."
5,A clasic,"I cannot understand why ""Airplane"" is not considered among the 100 bst films of the XX century. Different genrations are still enjoying and talking about that hillarious comedy."
2,chopped down from 95 min.,"this version of the film has had all of it's terrorism spit bombs and highjack jokes chopped out and why, because of the 911 tragedy?(g.m.a.b). david and jerry zucker can got to hell, for this new g rated edition. the only film i like by them still is the kentucky fried movie which still remains untouched to this day with the rex kramer stunt man and catholic high school girls in trouble sketches left in the film exxxtreemly funny!!!!!!"
5,Laughed my butt off!!!!!,"I'd just like to say this is the funniest movie I've ever seen. One day me, my mom, and my brother rented it. My mom said it was hilarious and we should see it. That was an understatement. I laughed so hard that by the end of the film i was short of breath. The seens with Ted and his girlfriend piloting the plain are so funny i almost died. I also liked the randomness of some of the seens. Plus, its always good to see a airplaine that looks jewish. (dont ask). I would give this film 50000000 stars if i could! I strongly recommend it!"
5,Damn Classic!,"Naked Gun movies BASEketball Mafia! Hot Shots If U liked any of these movies, then you will like AIRPLANE!. It is funny. There's always a new joke to it."
4,Airplane! A Favorite,"Airplane is a family favorite. We have enjoyed seeing this movie multiple times on tv and are glad to have a copy on dvd to watch again and again. We enjoy the humor behind it and having seen the more ""serious"" airline movies we enjoy the fun that it pokes at them."
5,Outrageously Funny!,"God this movie is so incredibly hilarious! Few movies have such witty and original jokes as 1980's Airplane! does. This is one of the best comedy movies of all time and is strongly recommended for those struggling with depression or just want a good laugh.A jetliner is bound for Chicago but when contaminated fish spreads illnesses on most of it's passengers and incapacitates both of it's pilots, it's up to a war veteran to fly and land the airliner and save the passengers before the illness claims their lives.This movie is so incredibly funny and is highly recommended for comedy audiences. They sure don't make comedy movies like they used to."
3,"It was OK, not as expected.","I was expecting the deleted scenes to be in the movie, not separate from the movie.The deleted scenes were just ""extras"" and had a lot of talk between each scene. Other than that, the movie itself was good."
5,"spectacular movie, amazing","airplane is another movie full of silly gags, wordplay and ridiculous characters. It's the best though. Airplane delivers a million gags a minute and each one is original and hilarious. The characters fit in perfectly and the story is just as good. this movie also deserves to be watched a hundred times, suitable for any age except maybe the kids under nine or ten."
4,Have you ever seen a grown man naked?,"Yes, yes I have. Airplane is the funniest piece of satirical menagerie this side of the funny farm. Well worth the rent, but seriously bring it back to Prime."
3,AIRPLANE STILL FLIES,"I remember to have laughed greatly when I saw it in the release date. Today I must admit that it has lost something of his grace. Anyway ""Airplane"" continues entertaining and Leslie Nielsen with his classic ""Don't Call Me Shirley "" is brilliant."
2,Airplane,I have since ordered and received AIRPORT that I have enjoyed.I was looking for AIRPORT and ordered AIRPLANE by mistake.
5,Super Silliness and Slapstick!,"Silly but funny, and the laughs last through many viewings - even though its now 30 years old. Also like having Kareem as a sidekick instead of O.J."
5,High flying low brow humor,"Airplane is one of the funniest movies of its day. It was the leader in films that spoof other films. Now that is not so unusual, but then it was a fresh new idea. The movie is crammed with sight gags and one liners. It was great to watch some of the ""old men"" of film, known for their serious acting, spoof themselves in outrageous scenes. The movie is worth watching if just to see Barbara Billingsly ( Leave it to Beaver's mom) do the ""I speak jive."" scene. This is not high comedy, but a lot of belly laughs. To catch all the jokes in this movie, you have to watch it several times."
4,"Excellent choice, has its down falls but what doesn't?","So I was looking around for this old game and there it was. Warlords Battlecry II, tucked away in some discreet corner of google. I immediately set my mind to buy it, did from used and what i received was exactly what they said. ""game with case manual and a few light scratches. It was completely playable and not much of a hassle. only problem i had was finding which patch to download, the internet wasn't too collectively helpful but i eventually found which one (its the 4th BTW just comment and I'll send you the link. After that i say back and started to play and it was great, love this game and would totally recommend it too any other R.T.S. players looking for a fun game. AI's are good although a bit predictable, and i have already figured out how to start wyth a low level hero and conquer. Super excited to beat his 4 times and buy Warlords battle cry 2 with even MORE Hero customization :-)"
3,Great way to kill some time...,"I picked this up over the weekend because I had some extra cash burning a hole in my pocket, and I admit I was surprised by the quality of this game. The game is a breeze to learn, but there are some nice complexities that will challenge most gamers. I like the combination of RPG and RTS that this game employs, and I can imagine (although I have yet to experience it for myself) that this game would be pretty fun to play in a multiplayer environment, which is offered. If nothing else, it's a great way to pass the time until the next 5 Star game comes out. Enjoy!"
3,:),Arrive on time ..But the price is a little highPlease reduce prices to customers to please everyone and form business relationshipsThanks
2,Flimsy stacker for blocks makes it impossible,I agree with the other reviewer. Truly flimsy piece of laminated paper that is supposed to hold the blocks while stacking.Horrible! Can't make straight stacks. Kids confused on how to stack. Not recommended.
4,Cylindrical container for rectangular toy,Great game but the oversized storage container doesn't make sense unless you like to dump all the pieces of the game inside. It would make much more sense to have a box shape for the storage container so it could double as a means of aligning the tower at the beginning of the game. As other reviewers have pointed out it takes a while to get the game ready using the included flexible paper guide.
3,Not as good as the Older ones,"Not finished like the older ones and stacking rack is of cheap quality. Way of the times I guess but it is what it is. Bought it for a gift.Still a lot of fun to play, but the pieces tend to catch on each other."
4,"Jenga, jenga, jenga.....","jenga, jenga, jenga, JENga, JENga, JENga, JENGA! Need i say more? And yes you should do the chant while someone is trying to pull a block out. It just adds to the atmosphere."
2,Could you possibly come up with worse packaging?,"Jenga is a great game, but the packaging of this version of the game is awful. Not only is it much bulkier than it needs to be, but the stacking sleeve is so bad I might as well say it doesn't have one. Get a different version of the game if you can."
4,Fun for the entire family,"Sometimes the simplest ideas are the most fun. Jenga is a simple game, but it can really bring a family together. This is not like a video game which can be played in solitude. This is a team game, a family game.I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy an evening of good wholesome family entertainment. The only think is to make sure you don't lose any of the blocks, as that can make the game less fun the next time around."
2,Where's the stacker?,"Um, how much did you save with the paper-thin stacker, Hasbro? What a joke! Stacking the tower tightly determines how high you can go! It's nearly impossible to do it right with this piece of paper! What would it cost to use plastic or even a slightly thicker piece of cardboard that doesn't bend? 10 cents?"
4,Fun game,This game is great for parties. Not much to the game so it's very easy to explain to those who have never played it before. Its a pain to pick up the pieces and rebuild it once it collapses.
4,great game,"this game is incredible... great for whole family from my 4 yr nice to my aunt/uncle. and love the container it comes in, with a handle. clean up is easydelivery on time."
5,Love it!,"Totally worth buying! I wasn't expecting the case to be so big, and for what i paid for it it was a good deal."
5,"Great game, misleading packaging.","I love Jenga and have played it for years. I bought this for my husband with the assumption that instead of having to build the tower after each game, one could toss the bricks into the nifty carrying case. However, when we went to toss all of the bricks into the bucket thingy they didn't fit. I would have bought the Jenga game in the regular packaging if I had known that, but ultimately, Jenga is a great game so it doesn't matter."
5,Classic and Fun!,"This has always been a fun classic game, and the best part is that it can be played with just two people."
1,This version is terrible quality!,"I had this game as a kid and LOVED it. So I was excited to buy it for my boys. However - right away we realized that the stacking sleeve is just a piece of thin cardboard. It used to be a nice thick plastic stacking sleeve. It's almost impossible to stack the pieces. Also, my husband and I are convinced that they now use a much lighter wood - the pieces just don't feel like they used to - overall, this game is USELESS. I don't even think we played it once."
3,I agree about the package,The round container ...really?...it just doesnt workWe love the game anyway. My son just takes extra time to set it up
4,Fun Game,We enjoyed playing this during the holidays. The tricky ways to manage stability kept us entertained. Definately a keeper and one we would recommend.
3,Let down by lack of stacker,"I'm guessing they opted for the paper stacker to meet some target price point. It was a big mistake.A hugely fun game is spoiled. The start of each game is a frustration.An otherwise hugely durable game, with wooden blocks and a good cardboard container is made less durable by using a flimsy, thin cardboard stacker.Jenga - we deserve a stacker that's of similar quality as the rest of the game and packaging. Even if the game costs a dollar more as a result."
5,"Quality...even the box? tube? canister, let's go with canister.","Neatly wrapped, same great game, nice thick canister with a rope handle. I've never taken jenga on the go, but I may just have to try after this. It's a good place to store the blocks and much easier to deal with the the plastic sheath my old one had."
2,Fun but lacking weight,This review is specifically to Model #53557. The hardwood blocks are cheap quality and lack any solid weight. Jenga is a fun game for the entire family. The game is meant to be played with solid dense hardwood not featherlight balsa-type wood. I would buy this product as a last resort.
5,very informative,I bought this book five years ago and still often use it and refer to the 5 elements charts. This book will teach you the basics on how Chinese Medicine works and how it can be integrated into self healing. There are also many healing practices within. Hope you enjoy it.
5,Right to the Point,This book at will give you just what you want to know. If you want to get into the bits and Bytes then you read every page and you will be a cryptography expert. If however you just need a broad understanding of the subject then skipping the Bits and bytes will do fine. I sell VPN solutions for a living and this book was a real help.
3,ZEP IN MINIMALIST MODE,"Presence shows Zep in a survival - rather than soaring - mode. The most significant difference here is Robert Plant's voice. Lower, weaker but somewhat unbowed - he nonetheless tries his best, with mixed results. The mix here is spartan, and generally absent of Zeppelin's rich grandiose soundscapes. Not for those expecting incendiary Zeppelin, but rather for those who want to explore their legacy. Zep delivers with its usual epics here ""Achilles Last Stand"" and ""Nobody's Fault But Mine."""
3,Powerful but shallow,"The production is superior, but the songs are missing. It's just a collection of tuneless riffs. ""Nobody's Fault.."" is so repetative that it sounds like they were making the tune up as they went along. ""Achilles..."" is still good, though."
2,Non-essential,"Coming on the heels of their finest work, Physical Graffiti, this is a largely phoned-in disappointment. Nothing stands out save Nobody's Fault But Mine, and even that is probably two or three minutes too long. With only seven songs, four of them six minutes or more, this is a clear example of the self-indulgence that dogged this band, or Jimmy Page to be more exact. Is there really a need for the nine plus minutes of half-hearted bluesy meandering we get in Tea For One? Additionally, several of the songs sound similar to each other and none of them, not even the opening opus (again, far too long) can compare to the best this band has delivered. Even the circumstances surrounding the recording of the album are no excuse for the uninspired songwriting. Zeppelin heads already own it, but the curious have a half dozen other much better places to start."
3,Pretense,"This is one of Led Zeppelin's weaker albums, in my opinion. ""Nobody's Fault But Mine"" ranks up there with Zeppelin's best work. But the rest of the album is not up their usual standards. I know that some people think that ""Achilles Last Stand"" is one of their best songs, but I think it's overrated. If you only buy one Led Zeppelin album, it shouldn't be this one."
2,not up to code.,Really a disappointment. Achilles last stand and nobody's fault but mine are good songs. But this album does not rock. A far cry from stuff like 'heartbreaker'. The verdict:Sorry guys. It's all over.
3,Remember brave Achilles,"This is one of Led Zeppelin's weaker albums, in my opinion. ""Nobody's Fault But Mine"" ranks up there with Zeppelin's best work. But the rest of the album is not up their usual standards. I know that some people think that ""Achilles Last Stand"" is one of their best songs, but I think it's overrated. Start off with Led Zeppelin's earlier albums before you buy this one."
2,"After buying the cd, you'll never be the same again","What a crap! But in no way a surprise seeing the zeppelin of Robert, Jimi, John and John Paul began its falling with the 1975 Physical graffiti. Where have gone the freshness and the inspiration of the best rock'n'roll band ever. If you're not a fan, just listen to the 5 first albums (all excellent) and at a pinch to ""physical g"" but venture no further! This album is for fan, not for fun!"
3,Bad Zeppelin,"This is the second worst of Zeppelin's CD's (Only Coda was worse). ""Only Achillies Stand"" and ""Nobody's Fault But Mine"" are very good, the rest is filler (Candy Store Rock might be the WORST Zeppelin song EVER (That or ""Hats Off To Roy Harper"" it is close)). This CD is for completests only (And I guarantee you, it will not be played that often even by them (I know, I have everything except ""Coda"", and I avoid ""Presence"" like the plague). You can get ""Achillies Last Stand"" amd ""Nobodys Fault But Mine"" in disk 2 of ""Early Days & Latter Days"" (An excellent greatest hits package), so you do not even need to spend the money on ""Presence"" to get them. Simply put, this is a bad Zeppelin CD."
2,Weak Zep,"Don't waste your money on this album unless you're a completist. It's a bunch of filler surrounding one killer song, ""Hots on for Nowhere."""
4,Zep Keeps Rocking!,"""Presence"" has been called many things from a generally good album to the start of the downfall of Led Zeppelin. Neither assessment is correct. What is true is that ""Presence"" is the most underrated Zep album. It follows closely behind Zep's finest album ""Physical Graffitti"" which tends to overshadow all of Led Zep's work. The fact is that no rock fan should be without ""Presence"". ""Achilles Last Stand"" is probably the group's hardest sounding song & stands up nicely with other faves like ""Stairway to Heaven"" & ""Kashmir"". ""For Your Life"" displays awesome work from all 4 band members & so does ""Hots On For Nowhere"". My personal favorite from ""Presence"" is ""Tea For One"". Led Zep does the blues so well & this is actually among my top 3 Zep tunes.You can never go wrong with Led Zeppelin & ""Presence"" will blow you away."
4,"Bluesy, and classic!","yes.. I know what you are saying.. This album is bad, I don't want to listen to it, 7 songs and they are WAY too long. Well very true but then again I can say that Zeppelin doesn't have a worst album, they always remained fresh with ideas and full of energy but on this some of it is gone but also note the condition of the band.. The year was '76, Physical Graffiti had sold a lot of copies, the tour was over, and Robert got himself in a car accident.. and to come up with an album like this in that condition is truly amazing, Page is a genious on guitar and this album proves it with ""achilles last stand."""
4,Another great rock album from Lez Zep !,"Another very good cd from Led Zeppelin. Not easy for them to make a good follower to House of the Holy and Physical Graffiti, but they almost make it. Still a very good one. Achilles Last Stand is very good. A good starter I can tell. Nobody's fault but mine is a classic.The hidden jewel goes to the last one, a beautiful song from Led Zep, Tea for One is an excellent song, well worth the discovery, in my mind, almost as good as ""The Rain song"""
3,not great,"everyone knows zeps history the worlds greatest live band of all time and possibly in the studio not to many better in there peak form.I would never knock them to harshly for the great memories and the song remains the same and the music moves me in positive ways most of the time.but we are talking about presence and this disc is very commercial.of course plant sounds like his usual self,bonham,is playing the same drum patterns and page is playing well but not being innovative.sure the songs are loud and the production is good but you could almost sense they wanted to get this disc wrapped up.my initial reaction was to say I didnt like it but I just cant do it to my boys.If you are a zep freak I suppose maybe you have to have it.great is great and classic is classic this is just plain not my zep,sorry boys"
4,Underrated Gem!,"This album is worth purchasing, even if just for the 3 tracks ""Achilles Last Stand"", ""For Your Life"" and ""Nobody's Fault But Mine"". These are all hard-rocking, masterful songs in my opinion, and show that Zep had far from lost their mojo on their second to last album (not counting Coda). While those three songs are 5-stars each on their own, the album does however suffer from 3 of the other 4 songs being mediocre, and 1 (""Candy Store Rock"") being completely awful. Either way, the album is still worthy of 4 stars, maybe even 4-1/2 considering both the strange circumstances and the short time frame they recorded it in."
3,Not at their best...,"...but if you're a Zep fan you gotta have it for ""Nobody's Fault But Mine"" and ""Achilles Heel"""
2,No Presence,"This album has to be one of the worst from Led Zeppelin. Only Achilles Last Stand, Nobody's Fault but Mine, Tea For One are good, but the rest is major filler. Simply put, this sounds like a band trying, to ""sound"" like Zeppelin, but falling way short. The writing is very uninspired and since an injured Robert Plant was basically phoning in his performance from bed, the results were less than satisfactory. Music fans seeking the same dynamic Zeppelin experience as the 1969-1973 period, should really look elsewhere.If you thought Physical Graffiti was shabby, well, stay away from Presence!"
2,Decline sets in,"Any of Led Zeppelin's albums recorded before ""Presence"" would be a better purchase than this one. The problem isn't the band getting older, its in the songwriting, which is mediocre compared to the high standards they had set for thelselves. Only the great ""Nobody's Fault but Mine,"" measures up to the early days. Maybe Neil Young was right when he sang that its better to burn out than to fade away."
4,"It's no Physical Graffiti, but it has its ups","Presence is not the greatest album, but you have to give it credit. A few of the songs are good, such as Achilles Last Stand, Nobodys Fault but Mine, and For Your Life. Tea Is For One, Hots on for Nowhere, and Royal Orleans are so-so, while Candy Store Rock is just bad. Bonzo's Montreux, (Recorded in 1976, but never released until Coda, 1982) would have been a better choice for this album. Below are my five star ratings for each song:Achilles Last Stand: *****For Your life: ****Royal Orleans: ***Nobody's Fault But Mine: ****Candy STore Rock: **Hot's on for Nowhere: ***Tea is for One: ***~Presence isn't the best album in the world, but for [money], you can't go wrong."
4,Just buy it.,"this is one of Led Zep's best work. Just listen, I mean listen to Nobody's fault but Mine and Tea for One. You'll be a believer too."
2,Sub Par Performance,"Not the best Cd in the Zeppelin canon. Achilles' Last Stand is great, but the rest is downhill from there. Very disappointing Cd. I expected more from them."
3,NOT THEIR BEST ... BUT IT'S STILL ZEPPELIN !!!!!,"Jimmy Page is the most overrated guitarrist of all times. But the guy worked hard to achieve success and devised a winning formula for LEd Zeppelin to conquer the whole world: bluesy tunes, heavy tunes with an edge to it. IN other words: marvellous songs. You don't need to be a Yngwie Malmsteen to write great rock stuff (by the wat, Malmsteen has no soul - his playing is silly and boring, just scales and more scales and mores scales and hiring those ""gothic"" singers.. Blergh !!)PRESENCE is not he best Led Zeppelin album, but Led Zeppelin in not top notch form is better than 98% of the garbage around nowadays... ACHILLES LAST STAND is the best."
3,Drumming,"The drumming makes this record, though I don't agree that Bonham was the best drummer of all time. He played very hard and loud, that's all. Very little technique. He wouldn't hold a candle to Neal Peart of Rush."
2,Definitely their worst album.,"The songs in this album are for the most part long and notvery commercial; that's why you rarely (if ever) hear them onthe radio. I only like three of them: Tea for one,nobody's fault buy mine and Achilles last stand. I enjoytheir last album much more."
1,Oh Dear.,"Now don't get me wrong - I love Zeppelin at their finest. Unfortunately, this is not. When I bought the album, I listened to the whole thing through.That was the last time that happened, and I bought it 15 years ago.Twice I tried to listen to it again - each time separated by about 4 years - and I never made it through side one of the LP.In a word, boring."
4,Overlooked near masterpiece,"While not in the same league as previous classics this is still agreat album that was sadly delegated to record store bargain bins soon after its release. Achilles, Nobody's Fault, and Tea For One are classics of the mighty Zep as good as anything they've ever done. The remaining tracks range from good to average."
3,Its ok,"Achilles Last Stand is one of the greatest zep songs there is, and Nobody's fault but mine is pretty good too, other than that the songs get a little repetative. a lacking performance from jon bonham (drums). i give it 3 stars."
2,Guess obligation to the record label,"Ok, based on Coda and this album, I am worried about completing the rest of my Zep LP listening, this must have been an obligation to the studios."
5,Led Zeppelin doesn't miss (again),"Presence is a more grown-up, if that is the word, sound from these fellows. I enjoyed it as much as I did any of their other CD's."
4,A DIFFERENT LED ZEPPELIN,"THIS CD IS NOT THE LED ZEPPELIN FROM THE '70s ... AND PROBABLY IS AN INDICATOR OF THE DIRECTION THE BAND WOULD HAVE TAKEN IN THE '80s HAD NOT JOHN BONHAM DIED. NOT THEIR BEST WORK BY FAR ... BUT HAVING SAID THAT, IT IS STILL LED ZEPPELIN ... A BAND WHO ON MANY LEVELS YOU COULD ARGUE RANKS SECOND ALL-TIME TO THE ULTRA-TALENTED BEATLES ( SORRY STONES ZEALOTS , BUT #3 IS STILL SUPERB ) ..."
4,An underappreciated masterpiece!,"Presence has an unusual quality to it - no other Zeppelin album is quite like it. Rhythmically it's their best album of all. It was recorded rather quickly, giving it a frenetic vibe with a sense of urgency that just ropes the listener in. Jimmy Page and John Bonham find every little pocket of rhythm on this album and fill it perfectly. Songs like ""Hots On For Nowhere"" and ""Royal Orleans"" are among their most underrated. Page is masterful in his guitar overdubs on this album and Bonham's drumming is all over the place. A perfect example of their interplay is on ""Nobody's Fault But Mine"" - this is Bonham's finest hour on the kit in my opinion. He was legendary for playing slightly behind the beat like no one else, and it shows on this album. This is straight-ahead hard, funky rock with elements of blues and country. It's got an aura all its own."
3,Shades of a new era which sadly never happened,"I think of this album as the shape of things which never were to come. The whole album sounds new and different, as if a new attitude has spread across the band. I remember waiting and waiting in high school for this one to come out, and when it finally did, I was disappointed. How can a 16-year-old deal with the emotional turmoil of 4 seasoned rockers? Now, I appreciate what they did with the album, but I have no happy memories associated with ""Presence,"" tho' For Your Life and the guitar solo in Tea for One are up there with their best moments. And, of course, Achilles. Purchase, but with reservations."
4,good cd,"No matter how you look at it, this is a good cd. Achilles Last Stand sounds just as good, if not better than Stairway to Heaven (maybe thats cause Stairway is so overplayed). Nobody's Fault But Mine has some great guitar and a nice hook. The other songs are not as well known, but they all have a nice Zeppelinesque sound. This is a good cd, although not as powerful as IV or as driving as II."
4,ONE OF LED ZEPPELIN'S BEST,"I COULDN'T GIVE THIS ALBUM 5 STARS SINCE I GAVE MY FAVORITE ALBUM, LED ZEPPELIN II FIVE. THIS ALBUM HAS GREAT SONGS SUCH AS ""NOBODY'S FAULT BUT MINE"", ""ACHILLES LAST STAND"", AND ""ROYAL ORLEANS""."
2,High and outside,"Being a life-long Giants fan and probably only one of a few who has seen them play in four different home ballparks, perhaps I became too excited when I first learned of the pending release of this book and allowed my expectations to reach an unrealistic high. This would account for the major level of disappointment I felt upon obtaining and reading this book. It was horribly proofed and had the appearance of being hurridly put together. I was suprised more information about the manner in which the team came to New York from Troy, NY was not presented. I found the statistical data to be relatively useless and often contradictory to data found in the 3 major references of baseball statistics. Overall, this is not a very good reference and certainly beneath the work Mr. Peters has previously published about the Giants. Too bad, a little more effort could have produced a much better book, now we will have to wait for the next one."
2,"Readable, but where are the maps?",The book was interesting to someone who enjoys reading history. A definite disappointment when no maps or any other illustration appeared although frequently cited.
1,Not real happy,"I was not real happy with this certain place that my order came from. They sent the WRONG DVD completely. I had already ordered the one they sent- so I ended up with two. It would have been a hassel to try to send it back as I could not find the correct address to return it, and make the trip to the crowded post office at Christmas time- so now I have two of the same DVD. It wasn't until this review came on my e-mail that I could actually see which place had sent the wrong DVD as I did not know which one actually sent the wrong one- they were different names- but on my print out- it only gave the begining of the name- which is the same-- so now at least I can state my opinion on this- but I am still stuck with the DVD. It wasn't operator (ME) error- as i found my papers and it clearly shows the proper way it should have been."
5,The inside scoop,"This book has been the most helpful of the three I ordered. I am looking forward to carrying it around London. His comments are always down to earth, just like his tv series. I know his information is current and is in common language that is easy to understand."
4,travel book review,"This book isn't written with the same breezy style as the other Rick Steves books, but it will be a useful guide."
1,Enough Already,"I've had it with the Rick Steves Groupie crowd. We just came back from a month long trip in Europe and the only people anyone with the Rick Steves guides are meeting are other Americans with the same guidebooks. They all eat in the same restaurants and they all go to the same places. Europe Through the Back Door? Not hardly. It's Europe through the SAME door. Read a guidebook before you go somewhere, but leave it home. Have a small pocket map of some sort along with you and then ASK questions from locals when you get there. The whole idea of travel is to meet new people, enjoy a different culture and have some fun. The purpose is NOT to check things off a ""to see"" list."
4,Good Book,A little more musuem info than I would have wanted but it's still a really great read for a first time traveler to London!
2,Too Limited,"Do not buy this book if you are looking for a good overall guide to the city. It is limited to Rick Steve's personal choices of what he thinks a visitor should see--which is the regular ""tourist stops"", and the museums. There is only one small overview chapter I found helpful.There is not enough here for the traveler interested in other parts of the city.Fans of Rick Steve's who wish they could have him as a personal guide may like this book. Each chapter is either a walking tourof the typical ""tourist route"" or an INDEPTH tour of one of London's premier museums/cathedrals.Which is fine if you want to be ""lead by the hand"" so to speak, but with your nose in a book.This combined with another, like the Eyewitness Guide will give a better coverage.I prefer books that give me a broader overview, with some detailed guidance. Read this one for good coverage of the typical tourist route, then look for another for a better overall view."
5,Great travel book. Wouldn't go anywhere in Europe without Rick Steve in my bag!,"I wouldn't think of going to Europe without Rick Steve. He is opinionated about what he likes but his advice is usually right on and very current. I enjoy an occasional museum but don't want to spend my entire vacation inside and he does hit the highlights of great museums if you don't want to spend an entire day there. My only complaint would be that I do like to shop and when he rates Harrod's in London as ""just another department store"", I might have to disagree! Anyway, it is fun to notice other travelers looking at their Rick Steve's books when we are in Europe!"
5,Great Book,This book saves you lots of time and energy planning a trip. Steves even walks you through museums down to every corridor. Great book - we would have been lost without it!
5,Rick Steves comes thru again,Rick always comes thru with great information on where to go and what not to waste your time on. I enjoy the way that he suggests ways to immerse yourself in the culture of the place you are visiting.
2,Not nearly as good as other London travel books,"I'm amazed at the positive reviews this book has received. If found it severely lacking for a number of reasons: First, it has very few maps, the ones it does have are terrible, and there is no coordination between descriptions of things and their location on the maps. Second, it lacks the kind of detail that you'll find in some other books. Finally, the section dealing with accommodations is almost completely useless. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this book.If you want really good London tavel guides, the Rough Gude to London and the Eyewitness London guide are far, far better."
2,no need to buy it!,"It's only a two star rating for the pointlessness of the cd, not because of the music. The music is great! My one year old son points at the cd rack and says 'tricky!' when he wants to hear it, but if you have the game, you don't need the soundtrack. Every song featured in the game, (except for some reason, the pizzacato 5 track) is playable in any order you want from the dvd content menu (under 'jukebox') when you first put the game in the playstation. Also, this music cd has only half of the tracks which are used in the game..."
2,Not impressed,"I had to buy the extra high for an AR build. I have a set of Leupold QRW on my deer rifle and the quality and design are MUCH better on the Leupold. These Warne happen to also be spec'd for Picatinny vs. Weaver, so that was another reason I had to use these. These are a real pain because you have to split them to mount the scope.When you lap these (you always lap your rings, don't you?) you also have to pay attention to not go too far. They are not very truly round, and where they meet at the top they don't have much clearance to tighten. Given the AR doesn't have much recoil I think they'll hold just fine, but I could not achieve a 70-80% lapped surface--more like 20-30%. I suppose you could always remove some material where they meet at the top.In summary, if you can use another system, look into that. For $80 I'm not impressed."
4,"Okay, I'm Hooked","This DVD holds our house record for the longest continous time in the DVD player- 9 straight days. My kids wouldn't watch anything else after we got it.I've enjoyed this movie much more watching it at home than I did when it was released in the theaters. It's hard to explain why. Maybe because my children can watch it. It may be because the Dolby 5.1 surround is crisp and the careful transfer is wonderfully clean. Could be that Neverland is green again, unlike the brown I recall in the theater.Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams received very little credit for their work in this film, but should have. Both are very enjoyable in their scenes. Not many bonus features are available on this disc, however.This movie suffers from what many of Spielberg's films suffer from- impossibly high expectations, and the shadows of blockbusters like E.T., Jaws, and Close Encounters. Still, it is a fine addition to your Spielberg collection. And your kids will love it."
4,great blu-ray but no extras,"Last time I saw this wonderful, fun film was on fullscreen VHS or standard broadcast TV. I've always wanted to get the DVD version but never got around to it but when I saw the bargain price for the blu-ray, I couldn't resist. Watching it in widescreen, HD and with DTS-HD master audio is like watching an entirely different ""Hook"" experience then I remember it. I really enjoyed watching it again. It's a pretty good video transfer, not reference quality (hey this film was made in the early nineties!) but there are NO EXTRAS to be found. Not even a trailer. I remember watching a making of feature somewhere a long time ago, i'm sure there are plenty of extras out there somewhere but I guess ""Hook"" hasn't really gotten the attention it deserves. But anyways, it's a great bargain price and nice HD for your Steven Spielberg collection."
3,not HOOKED on this movie,"I liked it but it was only okay. The beggining was very boring, and the end was vey boring. The middle was very strange, for example, Peter Pan (Robin Williams) was eating invisable food. Kind of strange if you ask me. Little kids would like it though."
3,Didn't quite make it.,"This was a cute idea and a blown opportunity. Spielberg's trusty messages are on full stage here. This gives us our ""how to be a good parent"" message just like his ""War of the Worlds"" did and the obvious diversity in your face make-up of the Lost Boys is as plain as Jeff Goldblum's daughter in ""Jurassic Park: The Lost World"". Why couldn't we just have a rousing, magical tale with pirates et al? Why does he have to teach us a lesson in his films? That being said, the performances are first class. It is just a shame that the focus of the film was so blurred."
5,classic,I loved this movie as a kid and now my kids love this movie .. its a classic .. if you've never seen it and you like Disney movies this is a must for watching with your kids
4,Cute movie,I live ordering my movies on my computer. My son loved this spin on his favorite movie. He's convinced he's Peter and his sister is Wendy.
4,The grandchildren & I loved this movie.,This is a wonderful movie. The grandchildren & I watched it again & again. It brought out the kid in me. I will watch it again with my 3& 4yr. old grand-sons. It is a magical movie.
5,I loved it,"to those who didn't like it ""lost lost lost.... I've lost my marbles"" My fav. line, I mean come on people loosen up a bit a live a little! stop citizing every little tiny flaw! It was supposed to be fantasy, I personally loved this movie it was great..."
4,The Kobayashi Report,This is one of the favorites I've seen a lot when I was a kid. Sure it isn't one of the best movies but this one is pretty good.
5,Family movie,"Awesome family movie, that we watch time and time again. Robin Williams never fails to entertain us all."
5,Good for adults and children,This movie is a good Peter Pan movie to watch with your family. It is geared towards children with an adult touch to keep even Mom and Dad interested. I recommend it for families to watch together.
5,GOOD MOVIE FOR FAMILY,My 5 years old son love to watch this movie. He also watch Disney Peter Pan(anime) but after few months I bought Hook and peter pan(no anime) then he liked it very much because he know the story from Peter Pan animation so it is easy to understand.
5,I demand Hook on BLURAY!,"One of the greatest movies of my childhood. Seriously, why is this not already being remastered and put on blu ray to share with future generations?! A great movie intended for all to enjoy, please write the studios an email, write Stephen Spielberg and tell them to get this on Blu-Ray stat!"
5,Good ol' fun,"I remember when I saw this film way back when, and now that I've just seen it again last night, I remember just how great it is! It's a wonderful jaunt though the world of the imagination, an escape to a world that has enthralled readers and filmwatchers for decades. 'Hook' is a lighthearted break from reality suited for anyone who enjoys a little fantasy."
4,Fun for the whole family!,"I liked this movie very much when I first watched it, being a grown up and all. Now I wanted my kids to watch it too, and I was right: they loved it! Wonderful, funny, fantastic story, with such great actors! I was hoping it was in spanish for my children, but it didn't have the option. They could understand a few things, but even with myself acting as the translator, it was wonderful for all of us!"
1,Another example of Spielberg's arrogance...,"We got a great history, almost a legend. Then they take RObin Williams (ridiculous as ever!) to be Peter Pan! They must have thinked :""what a great different idea, how we are brilliant!"" But they just destroyed the history, making two hours of torment watching this lousy picture, whre even Julia Roberts doesn't save herself.!"
1,Watch it once and throw it away,"It gets tiresome watching movies of dysfunctional families that try to find their way to normalcy. Our culture has lost that sweet spirit and moral sense of values we once had more of, and this movie is the quintessential product of it. We would not show it to our children and the movie was bad enough that we just tossed it in the trash. Even so-so movies usually wind up down on the bottom shelf. Not this one - out in the garbage."
5,I'm Rather Surprised,"I'm surprised (a good surprised) that there are alot more 4 and 5 star ratings on here. Pretty much everyone I've talked to personally, didn't really care for the movie. I loved it! :) It has a different twist to the old time fictional legend that we all grew up with. Where Peter Pan isn't exactly my all time favorite character, I've learned to love this character in this rendition. It has some of the humor and the wonderful fantasy that we all adore...well for me anyway. :) It's a fun movie to watch."
5,the best movie ever,"Hook was my favorite movie when I was little, and it still brings tears to my eyes for the ending which leaves you with so many mixed feelings. With a soundtrack that matches the story up perfectly it is amazing how it tells such a good version of the story of Peter Pan, while adding it's own completely unique qualities."
5,Completely Enchanting!!!,"I do not have an ""all knowing"" Peter Pan background, but I do understand fantasy and magic. Hook is a new and exciting portrayal of a classic tale. Complemented by special effects that enhance the magic and bring the story to life. If you're an adult who can relate to your inner child, you will love this movie. Children will be enchanted with the bright colors and the adventurous story. As for Robin Williams, he too is enchanting as always."
5,Still enjoying this movie many years later.......,Still enjoying this movie many years later.......Hook is just a great movie with a wonderful story with good actors like Robin williams....My favorite scene is when the food changes and also when the son imitates Dustin Hoffman Captain Hook!
5,Classic Movie,"I love this movie. The more I see it, the more I like it. As a dad, it really hits home. Be the dad to your kids while they are young and with you! Great acting, lots of action. Super family movie!"
5,Mush have!,This item was exactly what we expected. No issues or problems and it arrived very quickly. This is a must have.
2,Only the bedroom scenes were interesting and like the original,I thought I liked the movie as a kid but now watching it with my niece I realized this was not very good. The new live version Disney put out of Peter Pan in the early 2000s is great though.
5,Classic,"I watched this movie as a child and I brought it for my 9 year old daughter, she loves it just as I suspected."
3,a sequel of peter pan? ^_^,"First of all, I think this movie is not bad, but not too good either by comparing many other spielberg's movies. I watched the movie back in 1991 when it came out, I didnt realize its directed by Spielberg until just a while ago surfing in Amazon!Anyway, I just found it really interesting that this movie can work as a sequel of ""Peter Pan"" the other Pan movie made in 2004, it pick up perfectly where ""peter pan"" left off. Peter sent Wendy and the kids back home at the end of ""peter pan"", he come back later try to visit Wendy again, but this time in ""hook"", Wendy has become an old lady as its been past 50 years since his last visit in earth time! Peter then fall in love with her grand daughter and stays and gets old and so the story of ""hook"" begins...I mean how obvious this movie can work as a sequel and it was made 12 years before the first story. ^^"
2,"Steven Spielberg is one of my all-time favorite directors, BUT...","...when you propose the ultimately silly story idea of ""what would happen if Peter Pan grew up?"", even the legendary director cannot save the inevitable answer from being...WHO CARES!!!"
4,What's wrong with Hook?,"The answer- not too much, really. Sure, it's not as great as Peter Pan, but the movie still retains a bit of magic in it, even if it gets oversappy. Robin Williams makes a pretty cool Peter Pan, and Julia Roberts is, well, adorable as Tinkerbell. But it's Dustin Hoffman who steals the show as the overgrown Hook, who's eager to fight Peter Pan once again after so many years of hunting lost boys. Is it Spielberg's best? No, but it's not one of Spielberg's worst either. Consider it a great middle of the road movie for all ages."
2,Not new,"Ordered new from Amazon - was shrink wrapped, but no security seal and when put in DVD player it started mid movie. Played fine, but feel mis-led by Amazon"
2,To little here for the kids.,"I have watched this one a couple times. The boring parts are just to frequent and long. Like the poorly done Popeye, we just wait to long for the cool stuff. then when we get to the cool fight at the end, they kill off the Lost boy that my kids liked the best!Unfortuneately I bought it on VHS before I saw it. What saves the movie is that one can FF thru all the poor sections of the movie. Also, why make a movie for kids and kill of the second most interesting good guy?!"
4,good movie,"this movie is one robin williams' best movies. adults and children love this movie. i cant help but watch it whenever it comes on cable. this movie will eventually be listed up there with the classics. it's about the idea of 'what if peter pan grew up, and had kids?' i would recommend this movie to any person of any age."
3,Okay for the Classroom,"For a long time, Abboud and McCarus was the only game in town if you wanted to learn Arabic. Virtually every college course in Arabic used it throughout the USA.Now the picture is different. Arabic studies are not the arcane field they once were, and there is a great variety of material out there. Still, this set has its virtues. It has a lot of drill material, and while this can be a bore, it is a godsend in the final analysis if you really want to learn literary Arabic.The abundance of material makes it difficult to use as a self-teacher, however, and its better not used for that. Also, the print (done with an Arabic typewriter) is hard to read. My advise to the student is to start off with another course, and then switch to this series of readers when you've reached the intermediate stage."
1,"for the ""special needs"" student","This is used in my local high school and is geared for the student who never faced a foreign language before. It travels, like a desert caravan, at the speed of the slowest. Lots of repetition, lots of drills, and lengthy explanations of things that are obvious to anybody who has EVER studied a language. If you have always been totally lost in grammar class but have some life-threatening need to learn Arabic even if it's very slowly, this course is for you."
2,Emphasis Is On Beginner,"This book is fine for the absolute beginner, although there are better ones out there. Do not buy this book if you are even close to intermediate level guitar."
5,All around great nostalgia book!,"This is one cool book! For anyone who loves pop culture, Americana, and campy fun, this book is a godsend! It is jam packed with photos and no aspect of 60's culture is left untouched."
5,relief,got introduced to this product by my mother-in-law. So happy with it. good for muscle and joint aches. has gotten me through lots of achy days.
3,"Bought it, used and liked the product,","Bought it, used and liked the product, what more can I say. That's all I have to say about the product."
2,Doesn't quite reverse two hundred years of scholarship,"This book would be very impressive to someone with very little education in biblical criticism and scholarship. Many fundementalists like to carry it around and quote it as evidence of the Bible as the literal, inerant Word of God because it does give the impression of being very learned to someone who doesn't know any better. If you do know better, you will be irritated and frustrated by his simplistic and dogmatic scholarship. Still, it's not breathtakingly bad like most conservative Bible books, just very limited and one sided in its approach. There are any number of writers, such as Crossan, Paigels, Borg, Spong, and many, many more that present a far more comprehensive and intelligent analysis."
5,A fantastic Bible study tool.,"Chapters 1, 10 & 11 gives astonishing facts that intelligently prove that the Bible is the Word of God and is the most unique book on the face of planet earth. I love reviewing these facts, for they are irrefutable, and they give me information that I need when I defend the Bible. Thanks Josh for a great work."
3,Verdict or biased opinion?,"While the book is a good referance source for Christians, I find it lacking enough evidence for conversion of non believers let alone skeptics. I would have to equate it with using Peter Pan to validate Captain Hook. Still all in all it is interesting reading."
4,"Insightful, deep, and thorough look at Christianity","Lets be honest: people will believe WHAT THEY WANT. If you want to believe in Jesus, you will. If you want to believe that either Jesus didn't exist, or he wasn't from God, you will.This book is a great book that is in outline form with clear and precise arguments. It addresses several issues non-believers have with Christianity. It is not the end-all be-all of book, but it's a great start. This book wittles away at the illogical arguments against Christianity and the Bible, but it will only be effective if the reader has an open mind.I didn't give it five stars because it is far from an 'easy,' casual read. It is a great reference book. I also recomend the 'Case for Christ,' 'Case for Creation,' and 'Case for Faith' by Lee Strobel, written with the same sentiments as ""Evidence."""
4,A great way to research your beliefs...facts behind faith,I have both used and taught ETDAV several times over the past 20 years. Vol. 1 is more useful to the average reader than vol. 2 which is a college level treatise adressing weightier issues (presuppostion etc.).I recommend this book to anyone researching the `whys' behind the `whats' they believe.
2,It's a relative exploration of all things passionate.,The arguments contained within connect to the specific grasping of individuals who feel inclinations toward grasping and consuming.
2,only useful as a set of notes but leaves a lot of gaps,"This work certainly does not present any kind of compelling argument for Christianity. It reads like a set of footnotes used to make an argument, which is admittedly, the author's intention. For this it gets 2 stars instead of 1. However, the selected notes are still one-sided and simply reading them will not demonstrate to anyone with training in philosophy, history, or theology that Christianity is true. What one will get is a collection of opinions stated by various persons.The book shows no real appreciation for the advances in biblical scholarship and does not even really present arguments in outline form (as I mentioned, it just gives lists of opinions under each topic). Many of the quotes, though interesting, are not very helpful for constructing an argument and there seems to be an overreliance on secondary literature. A better, though not perfect, source would be Kreeft's ""Handbook of Apologetics."""
2,"Still operating from faith first, facts second point of view","McDowell's first section in this book, ""The Bible - I trust it"" should tell you all you need to know about his ""evidence"". His argument is that the Bible is unimpeachable and therefore is acceptable as 100% truth. So, inevitably, he uses the age-old circular argument: Christianity must be true because the Bible says it is. I expected OH SO MUCH more.And this, after the book jacket claims to provide ""Answers which will satisfy anyone who is willing to honestly weigh the evidence."" Too bad the author wasn't willing to offer up any non-tainted evidence."
5,Thoroughly researched,"This and the companion volume that McDowell has made constitute a thoroughly researched and well packaged presentation of the claims for the truths and beliefs of Christianity. This is a book of apologetics, so is intended to explain Christianity and the claims of Christ in a persuasive manner. I think it is about as good as any Christian apologetic work out on the market."
3,Evidence that demands a verdict,"Hello, my name is Philip. I am a 22 year old construction worker and a passionate believer in Christ; ever since He captured my heart in 2007. I enjoy this book, though I'm no where near finished reading it, because it offers a intellectual approach to the Gospel of Christ with scriptual backup. It enables the reader to better understand, through the wisdom of God, how to convey the truth of Christ to believers and non-believers alike. I recommend this read for a the hungry and thirsty truth seekers out there. I also recommend that one purchase a highlighter and notepad in conjunction with this purchase... This food needs to be savored and digested properly!"
2,ehhh,"a book is a book so how can you rate it bad, but this was not the book that i was looking for... same title and author, not same book."
1,An Ill-concieved joke on Christianity and truth.,"When i first picked up this book (at the urging of one of my Christian acquaintances) I thought for sure that my question about the objective truth of Christianity would be answered. About halfway through the book, i threw it down in disgust. Without the intimidating abundance of misinformation that frightens many people into accepting McDowell's thesis and his flagrant use of logical travesties, this book would be laughed at by everybody; not just atheists and the more well-informed Christians."
2,Read The Bible Instead,"The readers would do much better by reading Scripture. Unfortunately, too many people want the quick-fix and something easy to look at. This is not to say that all of McDowell's ""verdicts"" are wrong, but some are. People should think twice when a person is defending this book instead of defending from the Bible itself. Unfortunately, of the readers that I know, many of them do not have a strong biblical background. This is an easy way out for them. As a result, it has often led to disputes within churches that should not have occurred (our denomination is very scholarly and clear on most positions). For that, I would have given zero stars, but there are some points that it may benefit new Christians."
2,Evidence That Demands a Verdict,"This ""handbook"" of alleged Christian evidences leaves much to be desired. So much, in fact, that I have edited a book-length rebuttal to McDowell at the above URL. If you really do want to love God with all your mind, you will check out what I and my colleagues have to say before making a decision"
1,Cockatoo NOT COCKATIEL Purse,"THIS IS A COCKATOO PURSE NOT A COCKATIEL, YOU PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW YOUR BIRDS!!!!!!!!!!"
2,One little detail left out of the description,"The description above does not mention the product, ""contains petroleum distillates."" I personally don't want to put anything containing petroleum *anything* on my guitars. I returned the product as soon as I saw that warning on the back of the package, without opening it. The instructions state you're only supposed to use a ""pinhead-size"" drop, which seems to me that if you get this stuff on the varnish, you might harm it. Maybe this product works just fine in lubricating the nut or bridge slots, but I'd rather not take a chance on the finish getting damaged."
3,Good study manual... but be careful!,"This book is a really good Securty+ study manual, but there are significant pitfalls to be aware of. Like all of Bill G's products, it usually assumes that Microsoft software is the only and/or best solution to every possible computing need. CompTIA tests are supposed to be *vendor neutral*, but this book doesn't quite make it there. As a matter of fact, if you've been a computer user since the early days you might get downright offended at parts of it. Be sure that you keep this in mind and pick up something from another publisher to back up your studies so you'll be sure to learn about the rest of the non-Microsoft computing world."
2,"Good Information Source, BUT not to pass the EXAM","bought 3 books, to prepare for the Security+ exam, this one was the most organized,easiest to understand,and study from, ALAS, as indicated by all of the previous reviews, it is not enough to pass the exam, almost 20 of the 100 exam questions, were not even mentionned in this book,I have years of experience in IT, but failed the exam, thought it was my mistake, reviewd the whole book thinking I overlooked something, but no, it was not there at all. found that the Prep logic CDs, and Exam trainings are the best especially if you dont have enough time."
1,Stay away from this,I read 5-6 books and passed this exam in my first go. MS PRESS is definitely the worst among all. Some chapters does explain stuff quite well but in general it covers only 50% of what's suppose to be in exam. So if you read only this there's no way u can pass unless you already know other stuff not covered.
2,Fair Book but get other sources as well,I have used Microsoft Press books to get through my entire MCSE certification. I bought this book and used it along with Transcender and that was not enough to pass the exam. This book did not stress enough a lot of the key areas that were covered on the exam (especailly in the area of cryptography).
1,Useless,"Doesn't stay in place, too expensive... I do better with a waterproof diaper changing pad! I cut slits in it for the buckle and straps to go through, and it works TONS better. Save your money on this one."
1,lacking,"I thought I would save some time when preparing for my second child by just buying this product instead of sewing more of the seat-liners I made for my daughter. BIG MISTAKE!!!The coverage on this thing is abysmal! It is quilted with polyester batting. Polyester is NOT absorbent! The knit-terry (like baby wash cloths) on the next-to-bottom side IS probably around 80% cotton. So that is somewhat absorbent, but that is all you've got for absorbency! 80% of a super thin knit-terry.I ended up cutting this seat liner up to see what it is made of, and then sewing more of my own design (much better coverage!)using ProCare as a barrier and 3 layers of super-soft, 100% cotton quilter's flannel."
2,"Great idea, terrible product","The thought of not having a mess on the baby's car seat if the diaper should leak was very appealing and when I discovered this Piddle Pad I quickly bought a few, thinking I'd use it in several places, not just the car seat but also the stroller, the high chair, etc. Yes, the terry cloth top will absorb liquid, but once you throw it in the washing machine or even hand wash it, the entire piece will dry crooked, it loses the proper shape, and won't fit right no matter how hard you attempt to place it properly. This is one of those things that are good in theory but not in practice unless the design and material is corrected."
3,Safety net for potty training,"Great product for potty training, you can throw it in the wash and put it back in in no time. It made things easier for my daughter who stressed out when she realized she had to go right now and I could not stop the car.Yes it could be made better (find a way to make it stay put) but it does what you need it to."
3,Piddle Pad is just alright,"We got this piddle pad in case our potty training daughter decides to have an accident in her car seat. The concept is brilliant....take the piddle pad out and not the entire car seat cover. However, it rolls up and is not easy to keep in place. Half the time when we put her in we don't even straighten it out b/c it's so bunched up. So, who knows if it will even work if she has an accident. The concept is good, but there needs to be a better way for it to stay in place."
4,KG wrote great lyrics,Keith Green wrote some of the best lyrics to music in Christian music history (he was top of charts long after his death in early 80s). These are contemporary artists performing his songs. Good.
2,"If you like Keith Green songs, stick to Keith Green","Very disappointing album, which, as another reviewer said, basically leaves you wanting to hear the Keith Green originals. The only highlights (and ""highlight"" seems like a strong word), were Martin Smith's Create in Me a Clean Heart and Matt Redman's Make my life a prayer to you. Stick to ""The Ministry Years."" Keith Green sings with a whole lot more passion than these overly synthesized covers."
1,Disappointed and Disgusted,"These performances suggest no respect for the original production. Were the recording artists just trying to make a buck? The sound quality and phrasing are very poor. Some selections sound like they were recorded by a junior high garage band with no practice. Some groups obviously cannot spell a chord. What a disappointment! This CD is not a tribute to Keith Green, and certainly falls short of being true to his wonderful spirit."
4,What a stunner!!!,"This book is difficult but so marvelous that it is well worth the effort required. If you are wed to the idea of so-help-me-God facts, this book isn't for you. It is full of magic and mystery and sheer out-and-out glorius poetry.It is full of moonlight, spiderwebs and golden raintrees. If this book were visual art it would be a William Morris wallpaper.It is full of the sadness and glory of the Sirens chapter of Ulysses. It has the heartbreaking beauty of nostalgia . It has the life affirming strangeness of Moby-Dick. It is like a thousand other things and utterly itself."
4,Acoustic Get up Kid,"Matthew Pryor (singer, guitarist for the Get Up Kids) releases his second solo album as The New Amsterdams. The album's opening notes of harmonica and acoustic guitar remind me (in a good way) of Bruce Springsteen. Album highlights are song 2 (picture in the paper) and 3 (son of a prophet). These are excellent, beautifully written and sung songs that, unfortunately, set too high a bar for the rest of the album. While still good, after the three song intro the music tends to blend together.Fans of GUK will recognize the sound from ""Out of Reach"" and ""I'll Catch You"" from Something to Write Home About.Bottom Line: Good, not excellent"
4,It's New and OK,"Para Toda Vida is somewhat better than their first album. They, in a way, sound a lot like Dashboard Confessionals, but do possess and different beat and sound. More than the songs, I was only looking for calm music I could listen to rather than loud, hard rock. It's perfect for just plain easy listening or on the road."
2,NEVER RECEIVED,"I wish I could review this, but I never received it. I think it would do a pretty decent job with exfoliating my skin....although, there have been a couple of AB Hydroxy acid products which caused little pimples (mulluscum?) on my skin"
1,Disappointed,I waited and waited and waited and only after emailing the company did I find out I was not going to get my product !!!
1,Earth Science A/B Hydroxy,"I saw this product on Dr. Oz, so I ordered it. I have very sensitive skin...it cause a rash on my face. Unable to use it...waster of my money :-("
3,Fauntleroy,I have always been an admirer of Eddie Bartholomew's movies. But I would rate this one as fair. The remake with Alec Guiness is much better. Bartholomews best film I think is Captains Courageous with Spencer Tracy. That one is timeless!
4,Great for a 2-year old!,"My 2-year old daughter received this on her 2nd birthday and loved the simple, bright pictures and the moving features. We've read it to her at least twice a day for 3 weeks now. Not much text. the Happy Birthday song in big letters really gets her going."
3,Condition: Used Good,"Although the condition of the book was indicated as ""Used Good"", a number of page/ movebable components were very worned and cannot last a few reads."
3,good for beginner,"This toy is good for a beginner, it is wide enough they shouldn't fall over much if at all. My son grew out of it quickly because it does not steer. It is great, but we are planning on upgrading to a balance bike."
4,My son loves this motorcycle! but...,"My son recieved this from his grandparents for his second birthday. He absolutely loves it!My only complaints:~As others have said, it does tip over. It is very lightweight and my son has fallen off of it a couple times.~You can't turn the wheels. I guess it's good for kids who still can't steer, but it's also hard for them to pick up and turn around their own.~I wish it had more stickers, particularly one for a windshield. It seems kind of plain."
4,20 bucks a good deal,My son saw this at a friends and wouldnt drop it... so we went to walmart and found it for $19.96.... Great deal... and it doesnt have the bar thing...
3,CUTE BUT NOT GREAT,This is a cute little motorcycle but my son has fallen off of it several times. it is very thin which is good for straddeling it but not good for turning and going over bumps in the sidewalk. It really does not steer very well.
3,one flaw...,"The front wheels do not turn left and right, they are fixed.When my son was little, he had a similar bike but it could be steered and it made it so much more fun.My daughter likes this bike, but it's not the same."
2,Cheaply made,It is pretty flimsy.... Cheaply made and it feels cheap too. My son is pretty agile for a 3 year old and the bike tips over when he rides it with a little speed.
1,The front wheel does not turn. Useless!,"The front wheel does not turn. This is completely useless. It might look good in picture. However, it is a very disappointing product. I think it should not be on the market."
4,Good American made toy,"My son enjoys this American made toy. It was easy to assemble and it seems durable. My only complaint is that the box it came in was covered in dust. To the employee who shipped this, please take the time to wipe your product off. Thank you."
1,Not so Great,"I bought this for my 17 month old daughter after seeing it on the Today Show as a best buy for toddlers. Well I was so excited to get it and when we got it it was a total flop! My daughter is very tall for her age (33 inches) and it still did not work well for her, it also TIPS very easily. The description says ""sturdy"" it was anything but that. She did not even get to go outside with it because she kept falling on the tile inside. We took it back and got a 4 wheeled scooter..much more stable. I am sure that this is a wonderful for toy for ages 2+ but it is not safe for the younger ones...in my opinion."
3,Motorcycle Not Quite What Was Expected,"This little motorcycle is cute. However, it's very lightweight and is similar in quality to a ride-on toy that could be purchased for much less at any discount retailer. The stickers do seem to be of high quality and to date, none have peeled off. The extreme shipping price added another $10 to the $19.99 price tag. This is definately not a $30 toy."
1,The front weel does not turn,"It's useless, the front will does not turn. The product have a pretty good feedback, I red some of them, but nobody pointed that NO TURN FRONT WHEEL out. I did not pay attention, when I purchased it. DO NOT BUY IT!!!"
5,I LIKE THIS BIKE!,"I decided to purchase this bike despite negative reviews. You have to know your kid before you buy this, my son is two and would not recommend this to any younger child. Although he did fall off a few times he got right back on till he got the hang of it. It's a light toy so the childs weight could be a factor in children falling off. If you ride or your spouse rides I think it's a great first motorcycle for a kid to practice........."
4,Overall it is a good toy!,My two year old son got this for a birthday present. He has really enjoyed it so far but he loses interest in it after 10 min. of riding. I wish it made some kind of motorcycle sound. I think that he would enjoy it alot more if it did! My five year son loves to try to ride it but it is simply to small.
1,Tips very easy,"This is motorcycle looks great in pictures, however it tips very easily and the stickers were not included in the packaging. A child cannot ride very fast without tipping over. I do NOT recommend this product to anyone"
2,Looks Cool,"So i bought this for my neice who was turning 3. For one thing when i received this toy it was incredibly hard to put together. Actually let me correct that the tires were hard to put together. It looked incredibly small also. The age range for it said 2-4 so she was 3 i thought perfect. When she sat on it she looked like a big kid on a little kids toy. It didnt make noise, it actually didnt do anything and she ended up bending it by standing on it cause its made of plastic. Now there is this HUGE white crease in the middle of the bike from where it bent."
2,"Dissapointed, you get what you pay for","I was wondering why this was so cheap, it looked really nice online, now I know!. It's very small and the front wheel is horrible, it won't turn, and my son falls off it all the time. I read the customer reviews after we bought it and saw that lots of people have that problem. Next time I'll check first. He likes it, but he's always talking about how the wheel is broken."
3,Got for free,"We actually got this motorcylce from a neighbor who didn't want it anymore. My daughter was very excited and so was I until she tried to ride it on the sidewalk. It fell right over and she scraped her arm. She's tried several times, but the balance is so off that she can't just sit and go. I'm glad I didn't pay for it."
4,My son loves this.,"If he could type, he would tell you he loves his motorcycle. He is 2 1/2 and thinks it is awesome."
4,Well made toy,"This is a very sturdy toy, but it pushes the age rating. Even though it's rated for 1 year olds, my son can't reach the ground because the seat is wide (he's average height). Even so, it's a fun toy and he enjoys being pushed on it."
3,Motorcycle,My son loved the motorcycle. I falls over very easy. Not very steady. My son has fun with it but needs to be watched closely because of the falling over
1,ok,it was bent when i got it i am not to happy about it i could not even put the stickers on it because they where all f up
5,Great!,"Great Product, it arrived fast and it is exactly as shown in pictures. Easy and quick to build, careful with the size, it gives the impression of being bigger than what it is."
2,Horrible oversight in the instructions,I couldn't agree more with the review on August 6. If you don't assemble correct the first time (which I didn't) you will ruin the bike. The problem is there are 4 small inserts that are designed to go in the wheel wells. Inexplicably the instructions fail to call this out in an obvious way. If you overlook the inserts (which are suppose to go in at the very beginning of assembly) you will ruin the bike upon completion of the very next steps. I'm sure I'm not the only one that had this problem and unfortunately won't be the last.
2,Poorly designed and poorly made,"I regretted this thing before I even finished putting it together. The assembly is somewhat intensive, requiring tools and muscles, and if you don't follow the minimal, ambiguous, visual directions exactly right the first time, you will ruin it. This toy is cheaply made and badly designed. I bought it for my 18-month-old who is jealous of his older sister's bike, but the wheels are too cheaply made to be useful outside. Although this bike fits him, he does not ride it, perhaps because the front wheel does not turn and the wheels do not roll easily and smoothly. His four-year-old sister, on the other hand, enjoys scooting it around the house. Go figure."
3,Motorcycle - no steering,"This bike is one of the few ride-on bikes on this US market. It is the perfect size for my 25-month old. The biggest minus for this product is that the front wheel does not swivel so you cannot steer the wheel. It also can be little wabbly, but my son was able to get used to it quickly and is able to keep his balance on it (indoor only so far). Turning around the corner is the biggest challenge."
4,Little Red Cafe Racer,"This is a very cute bike. The double wheels on both ends were a pleasant surprise, measuring about 5""-6"" wide. They make the bike very stable.What didn't impress me is the lack of stickers/decals. A windshield and a rear light and exhaust would have really completed the look. Also, I noticed my grandson could not really wrap his legs around it; making it difficult to reach the floor/ground but this will correct itself soon. For $50 I expected a little better.However, I still rate this toy an overall 4 stars because it seems safe and it's so cute."
1,Its not worthy,The quality of the product is not good. The plastic used for this product is very delicate. My suggestion is dont buy this product. It is not durable. Its looking good ...but not worthy.
2,Needs a better bell,The colored balls are okay and get some pecks but the bell is a dud as far as any tinkle that might amuse the bird. Or human.
5,excellent!,"such a cheap and loved toy by my cockatiel. He plays with it for hours. I wish I could find the balls sepparate, too."
4,Do not start with this book,"This is not Database for Dummies! The word introduction is a bit misleading to say the least and the words used are not the one you read in everyday life. If your are new to relational databases, you should read this book slowly (maybe one chapter per week). When you encounter a word or concept that you don't understand, go on the web or try an other book and find information about that subject. Then continue your reading. Reading this book is like creating a good database design: It's not easy, it is tiresome and a lot of time you will be discouraged. But in the end if you persevere it will be worthwhile."
4,"The database ""bible""","I used and still use this book as a standard for my lectures on databases, both in Poland and the Netherlands. Students generally see this as an excellent textbook, but also think it is rather difficault. Especially the ""writing-style"" is somewhat old-fashioned and not of today. In modern IT-education, where sometimes more emphasis is on 4GL, the book has become less useful unfortunately, but still students want it as a book of reference."
2,A Poorly Written Book,"In my humble opinion, this a very poorly written textbook. I bought it because it was recommended to me as ""the bible"" of all database books, but boy, what a disappointment. The technical content is all there, and Date is obviously a authority on the topic, but the book is next to unreadable. I would recommend to the publisher that a good editor be let loose on this book - the O'Reilly books are good role models. In the meantime, I would look elsewhere (on Amazon!) for a database reference book."
2,Too much,"This book is in no way an ""Introduction"" to databases. Date goes into incredible detail using extremely complex terminology and syntax. Throughout the book, he refers you to previous chapter's examples so that you may follow his current logic. His book is mathematically based, and this is painfully apparent from all his explanations, not just the chapters on relational algebra and relational calculus. To get an idea of this book's complexity, I have a BS in comp. Sci, and took high level mathematics, and I found this book EXTREMELY difficult & boring to read. Difficult mostly because I kept falling to sleep. I personally got nothing out of this book."
2,Could be better,"Not the easiest book out there to read. Uses terms that are hard to understand. The first 100 pages are okay, but after that forget it. Skips a lot stating that the book isn't big enough to cover it all."
1,A Devil Awful Book!,"This book is used as a text in my Relational Database Management class. Everyone in the class, except for the exceptional few who should be teaching it, give the same review. My instructor even had to modify the class because of it. My review is if you have less than a 165 IQ, don't even bother! Date is extremely knowledgeable, however only able to communicate in language understandable to Einstein."
5,Poetic and Pure...I highly recommend this album,"Rain and Mud and Wild and Green is easily replacing my favorites of the past. I listen to it at least once a day. The songs have a way of sticking in my head and staying there all day. Rarely does this happen when I want to go home and play the album more still! The songs are full and bright with humor, irony, realism, and imagination. Her voice isn't shaded by too many background instruments and complicated imagery; often sweet and angelic, but also raw and real, her songs are poetic and pure. I'd highly recommend this album. In her songs...like ""One Once More"" a beautiful, somewhat eerie, lullaby type of tune...she uses some of the best vocabulary references I've EVER heard in a song. Christine has a beautiful way of using words to nuture and support a song. Such a gift is rare and often misused. Christine harnesses this talent and makes songs that are assumingly personal and real. This album IS Christine Kane.I will buy it for everyone I know!"
3,I expected more,"Five years ago I heard Christine Kane play live in a small venue and was deeply impressed with her and her music. I have listened to A Thousand Girls countless times, and This Time Last Year only marginally fewer. So when I came across this album, I was very excited. It was a regular on my car CD player for a couple of weeks, but I must say that overall I'm disappointed. While her lyrics are thoughtful and often moving, I didn't find much thematic growth from A Thousand Girls to R&M&W&G. And that surprised me very much. ""All the Relatives"" seems to be ""Big Ol' Full Moon"" in a different setting. She's still writing about the guy who dumped her in South Africa. Also, on some tracks (e.g., ""The Way Clouds Do"") her voice takes on an odd nasal quality that doesn't seem to add anything to the song. This is a good album, but it won't be displacing A Thousand Girls on my top 10."
5,Very good and complete,"This atlas is very good at giving all the information, as recent as possible, but also giving information on countries and flags. It is very straightforward, and very easy to use."
3,Check the year on atlases!,"I ordered an atlas for a friend for Christmas and I was sent a 1963 atlas for ($). Not really a solid value considering it's almost half a century out of date!It is beautiful however and the service was fantastic. It's just not what I was expecting, and with an atlas the year is very important information. That should have been the first thing in it's description!"
5,Probably the easiest and most fun to look at and use.,"I also own what may be considered the definitive world atlas - that of The Times. The Times atlas has shaded colors for elevations and greater general detail than that of the National Geographic Atlas.Still, for me, I find myself picking up the National Geographic Atlas way more often. Why? Simply put, it's just the most enjoyable to look at and easiest and most fun to use. I like it better.A great work."
1,dollar for dollar not the best atlas,"I found the quality, accuracy, and ease of this atlas underwhelming for the price. It's the most expensive atlas out there, but has nothing on Hammond, Oxford, or Goode's--all of which are half the price. Don't be fooled by the big marketing campaign. NG might be powerful, but it doesn't make the best atlases."
4,Beautifully done but lacking in detail,"This is a beautifully done atlas but I wish more attention had been given to geographic details and a little less on ""pretty""."
2,"Light on Content, Too Many Ads",Not much else to say. It's an okay magazine as long as you don't expect much more than advertisements for dance competitions.
5,High-Level QB's Consultant,"I am a high-level QuickBooks consultant and love everything about QuickBooks. I study the Sleeter manuals carefully, and read them just for fun! These consultant manuals cover problems, tips, and techniques I've never seen anywhere else, but they are generally not for a novice user. I challenge myself to have QB's answers at all times to whomever may ask, and I usually do have the answers thanks to these texts."
5,"A nearly perfect record, but skip the first track.","This is an almost completely cohesive recording -- listening to the CD is being invited into his world, which may (or may not!) be a different affair than consensual reality! This is not a record that can be used as background music -- the way he combines and plays with Puritan earnestness, a nearly musicological approach, unusual instruments, and poker-faced humor demand strict attention!The only exception is the first track. ""99 Cops"" has little to do with the rest of the record -- it's as if someone decided that the subtle sense of humor of the rest of the record would be incomprehensible to listeners and this heavy handed, barely humorous, borderline offensive song had to be included to make the record ""relevant"" and/or a ""hit"".It's a great record -- his second record, ""The Operating Table"", is also WELL worth seeking out!"
5,Great CD,"I first heard Brian Dewan from the TMBG's Hello Music Club. I was impressed by his unique style and his electric zither. After seeing him live with TMBG, I got this album. I really like the cowboy outlaw song, which by the way, is a true story. Also, 99 cops is funny. I wish I still had this album, but it got stolen!"
2,"It is a good work that I compare to ""TOM FAHS IS BALD!""","THE ALBUM IS FAIR IN QUALITY. i saw him open for Violent Femmes last year and it scared the hell outta me. If you're into really weird music then you'll probally like this. this guy is very creative, but also very weird, listen to the letter and 99 cops and you'll know what i mean. OH, TOM FAHS IS BALD!"
4,A VERY STRANGE STORY,"Imagine your very worst nightmare; you have lost absolutely all references to your identity and are displaced thousands of miles from any contact with anyone who would be able to positively identify you. Since you are sort of a drifter to begin with, your problem is compounded. You have no money. You are kicked out of a few countries, decide that life is just too good for you in another country and that moreover you long to return to work at your profession, that of a sailor. A weird ship takes you on and now you can't get off it.This a story the likes of which you will probably never come across again. It is weird, the writing is vivid, and you become the doomed sailor reading it. You might not think the story the best you've ever read, hardly so, but you certainly wont long forget this one."
5,I LOVE IT!,"This stuff really works... NO JOKE! I could feel and see the difference in 2 days, especially in my face and waistline."
2,water pills,I noticed no different using this water pill....drinking more glasses of water illiminates water much better than these pills...waste of money
4,Lovely product! Fast shipping,"Would definitely recommend this rack, it looks great & has nice variety of spices. Was only sad that there was no garlic powder. But otherwise, a good buy!"
1,"Looks nice, but that's it.","The spice rack looks great, but the plastic tops on each of the bottles are made of very cheap plastic. Many of them don't shut at all and the ones that do still leak. I would not recommend this specific product to anyone. I thought Olde Thompson was a reputable company."
4,SPICES!!!,"I absolutely love the look of this product with a couple of minor exceptions. I was expecting some different kind of spices outside of the normal garlic powder or thyme. I was also disappointed, upon receiving the spice rack that I opened 1 jar that would not close back at all. Outside of that I really like the look and design of the spice rack."
4,Good...but there's 1 problem,The opnly problem I had with this movie was that it was funny charecters and lines strung together. Don't get me wrong the storyline and charecters were great. But with 2 movies it should have been more in depth like the vacation.
3,"Great Movie, Lousy Audio","After owning multiple copies of the video, I couldn't wait to see this DVD, I love this movie! I was very disappointed that the audio is only mono! I would have expected more from the 20th anniversary edition. This classic is begging for a remix."
4,Great classic comedy!,"Great classic, must own for those who love the 80's comedies.... some great actors that are going to be hard to replace as they fade away..."
2,Terrible transfer!!!,"This is probably one of the worst looking and sounding Blu-rays I own. The picture looks extremely grainy and old, almost like it was an upscaled VHS transfer. The picture looks amazing in comparison to sound by far. I've heard VHS tapes that sound much better than Caddyshack does on Blu-ray. Everything sounds distorted and muddy, that's the best way I can describe it. Even watching the movie with Sennheiser HD 598 headphones it was pretty difficult to understand what everyone was saying.I love the movie but I really wish I didn't buy it on Blu-ray. If I was you I'd buy the DVD version instead and wait and see if they release a better transfer for this movie!"
5,caddy shack,"It is a very funny movie, that you never get tired of watching.the stars of the movie did a really good job,of making every thing believeable.love it caddy shack"
2,Good movie - bad disc,"Disc always stops at the same location about 20 minutes into play, I am able to navigate forward to get it playing again but that ruins the movie. Defect discovered months after purchase, I plan to buy another in HD DVD or DVD format."
3,Great Movie--Horrible DVD,"It's hard to give my favorite comedy of all time only 3 stars, but it needs a two star penalty for the terrible picture, sound, and lack of widescreen format. The DVD looks just like the video. The trailer is funny, but obviously very dated."
4,A modern classic,"Caddyshack is one of the greats, but the other reviewers are right about the quality of this DVD. I've seen better prints of this film on TV! I can't believe Warner released the movie in this condition."
5,All time great,"If you haven't seen this movie yet you must!!It's hilarious.Triple it with Fletch and Summer Rental and I guarantee you'll be laughing all night unless you're one of those people that will purposely consider nothing funny for the sole purpose of starting a review ""I didn't find this movie funny"" because you want to be 'different than everyone else' which is quite funny because just about every teenager I know has the same personality I just described... in short, YOU ARE A LEMMING if you are this type. LOL!Worth buying, you'll like it everytime you watch it."
3,Another review,"... POSITIVE STUFF: has some HILARIOUS scenes,Bill Murray and Dangerfield are funny,the gopher is a good character. NEGATIVE STUFF: Too much filming is spent on the relationship between Danny and Maggie,It can get really boring,too long."
1,"There's a lot of bad in the world, Danny, including this DVD","It's easy to grin / when this video's in / and you've got a front-row seat. / But the DVD worthwhile / is the videophile's / WHICH HAS TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THE 15-YEAR-OLD FRIGGIN' VHS VERSION!!!What a disappointment this DVD was, particularly since the 19th anniversary edition just came out on VHS (it was decent, but not great). There had better be a 20th anniversary DVD that expands upon the 19th anniversary tape. We need interviews with Spaulding, Porterhouse, Chuck Shick, Terry, Dr. Beeper, etc. And we need them NOW -- chop, chop!This DVD obviously was a rush job, as was the 19th anniversary tape, which included a few great out-takes (Carl yelling Salud! as he encourages Ty to cannon-ball it) but was otherwise disappointing (no interviews with Czervik, Carl, Spaulding, Porterhouse, Dr. Beeper and many other critical cast members).Shack fans demand better (there's been a lot of complaints already)."
1,Faulty Disc,I ordered the video to play at a Caddyshack Trivia party I held for my trivia team & when it arrived it would not play. I even had the tech experts out to help & they couldn't get it to play. I had to go to a store & buy it for $15.98 + tax in order to have it in time for the party. This is the first time I have been disappointed in an Amazon order.
4,Speedy delivery,I got my DVD quickly and the wrapping was not excessive. I hate when I get things and I have a hard time opening them. I definitely recommend this seller.
3,depends on your style,"This movie is not for everyone. the humor is crude, the exting is a bit overdone, and there is a mechanical gopher. there are some funny bits to it though and you will laugh if you don't get sick of some of the characters first. all in all, if you haven't seen it, you probably should just to say you have. there is some good bonus material on this dvd as well."
1,not that into it,"My mom had this movie on VHS. I tried watching it a few times with out getting bored. But it didn't work. I decided to give Caddyshak a second chance. I ordered it from here for a good cheap price. I am in the middle of watching it at the moment since I received it. I'm paying more attention to it this time, but it is still a little boring to me. Its just not for me."
2,WAY OVERRATED AS A COMEDY CLASSIC,"I just finished watching this DVD after hearing so much about it for the past 25 years since it was first released. Quite frankly, the reverence bestowed upon this flick is just totally beyond my level of comprehension - it's essentially a b-grade drive-in movie, nothing more, nothing less. The best thing going for Caddyshack is the presence of Rodney Dangerfield. As for Bill Murray, has he ever really been funny throughout his career as a comedic actor? His fan base must be teenagers high on drugs, because I've never been able to see the hilarity in his deadpan smugness. And don't get me started on Chevy Chase - his most redeeming quality is mortality!"
5,Hilarious!,"One of the funniest movies ever. Right up there with Blazing Saddles and Animal House. Bill Murray, Chevy Chase and Rodney Dangerfield all at their best."
3,Caddyshack 20th anniversary edition,"Of course the movie is great and it was a great price, but the copy I received was a standard edition and not the 20th anniversary edition; I feel cheated."
5,The Greatest Movie Ever Made,"You know when all those BS top 100 movies of all time lists appeared last year with all those ephemeral choices by the so called experts? Where was the 'shack'? THIS is the greatest ever made. Nothing approaches Caddyshack and nothing ever will. Notice the latter scenes and all the extraneous stuff going on. I watch it at least once a month, just to keep my sanity."
4,One of the most quoted comedies of the early 80's,"I think that Caddyshack is one of the funniest films of the 80's. Though the humor is often silly, cast member like Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, and the infamous gofer, make this film well worth the time for anyone looking for some good, mindless comedy."
5,I can't believe no one has reviewed this movie yet ...,"Here goes! You will quote lines from this movie for the next millennium. It was the first movie I purchased when Video Disc players first came out (prior to Beta or VHS). Ted Knight is absolutely underrated as the hysterical Judge Snells. Bill Murry is exceptional as Carl, assistant groundskeeper at ""Bushwood"". Especially humorous to golfers, but reaches everyone with settings like the pool scene involving Spalding, the Judge's piggy nephew."
2,Great movie but when will it be available in in widescreen?,"Hilarious movie! Honesty has never been so funny! Rodney Dangerfield steals the movie as the crass developer whose honest and blunt remarks disarms and disgusts the pompous country club class. So what a shame to find that Warner Studios put its name on such a poor quality DVD release. Poor color quality, deleted scenes, no stereo soundtrack, no widescreen. Why bother to release it in on DVD if the studio didn't think enough about the movie or its buyers to remaster it. Fans should stay away in droves until the studio understands that DVD viewers expect some quality extras, not less, if they are going to buy the new format. It's really about more than just money, it's about the image, products, and reputation of a quality studio! If this movie is any indication, it seems that Warner may just have fogotton all that! What a loss to both the studio and its customers! Let's hope that it's only temporary!"
4,Still as funny as I remembered,"I've seen this comedy classic a hundred times, yet never felt the need to own a copy until my wife announced she'd never seen it. To correct this blasphemy, I ordered the Blu-Ray version right away. The digital conversion is very good, even for a movie shot long before such things were even dreamed of. The bonus materials were a little lackluster, but entertaining anyway. And of course, there's the movie itself. Caddyshack holds up very well over 30 years later...all the one-liners and sight gags get people laughing today the same way they always have. I really enjoy this purchase, and look forward to watching it another hundred times. Now if I can just get my wife to stop saying ""Miss it, Noonan""."
4,Comedy Classic,"Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield and Bill Murray do some of there best comidic work in this wacky film. The main plot is a little weak but that hardly matters when you have Bill Murray as a deranged groundskeeper trying to exterminate a Golpher, Chevy Chase as a strangely Zen golf pro and Rodney Dangerfield as a crass flamboyant nouveau riche real estate tycoon."
3,Caddy Shack,"The product was great I ordered it for a Christmas present for my husband along with some other movies and he loves it. The only problem was I used the supersaver shipping and it was supposed to get here before Christmas. Keep in mind I ordered it almost a month before Christmas so I figured it had plenty of time to get shipped. Anyway, after a few weeks and I still hadn't recieved a shipping notice so I called Amazon turns out they tell me I have to pay an extra $30 to get it by Christmas. If not it wouldn't be shipped out until January!! So I pay the extra $30 and it ends up getting shipped out the next day. It arrived a few days before Christmas but if I hadn't paid more then I wouldn't have received them on time."
3,Insanity... No Caddyshack.,"This is a great comedy movie starring many well known actors such as Chevy Chase and Al Czvenski.This movie is basically about Bushwood Country Club, a snobby golf course. One person is having a war against a gopher, one is the town blabber mouth, one hits on every girl he sees and is extremely rich, and possibly the main character is a caddy.The movie is also about a five-some playing a tournament at the country club.The reason I gave this movie 3 stars is because it can get REALLY boring(-1 star) and some of its humor is tasteless and un-funny(1=-1 star). This is a must-see if you're a golf fanatic, though."
5,I should of helled four!!!!!!!,I love this movie but warner bros Should have Remastered Caddyshack in 5.1 Audio it is in mono that SUCKS!!!!!
1,Golf! Isn't it hilarious!!! Er no it isn't!,"A friend of mine (Nick O) made me sit through this awful drivel last Saturday! We didn't even make it half way through the film. Bill Murray has his moments as does Chevy Chase but it's all so disjointed and old fashioned that it just leaves you cold and bored! If you're into quality, contemporary comedy, look elsewhere!"
3,Nestalgia,"Need it for the classic collection and to show our sons. Movie wasn't as good as I remembered, but still a classic. Good price, Good product."
4,"""Be The Ball......""","Caddyshack has to be one of the top comedies of all time. It is classic and hilarious!. You gets sports and comedy!. Anyways, there's not much plot here. It's the snobs against the slobs at a posh, private country club. This film showcases some of the best work from funnymen Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, and the late great Ted Knight. Bill Murray cxreated his most famous character with a speech problem that has become the most often used impression of Bill Murray. Don't forget the scene in the pool with the candy bar. It's absolutely heartbreaking to think that this classic comedy had to be marred by the absolutely awful pile of crap that was Caddyshack 2. At least Chevy came back for some decent comic relief in that one. Forget about the sequel. This is a comedy must!."
3,The audio/video transfer was nothing to write home about,"The extra footage about the making of CaddyShack had Dolby 5.1 audio. The movie itself was Dolby Center Channel with subwoofer. I feel that Center Channel only provides better sound then just Stereo Front (L&R) only, but I was still disappointed.If the original Star Trek TV series DVDs can manage Dolby 5.1 (they sound great), I do not know why Caddy Shack could not have been done better.The video transfer was ok. There are some ""specks"", as if you were watching an imperfect original.But it is Caddy Shack, and therefore these defects can be overlooked. But it was a poor showing by Warner Brothers.I would purchase this only if you are a Caddy Shack fan."
4,"Great movie, if only Oscar had a category...","Great juvenile humor! It is the movie every low budget comedy wants to be the next one. Sadly, this movie is the reason all of those skiing comedies came out. This is a film that is great to have running in as background noise while working/studying."
3,A VERY FUNNY MOVIE,"THOUGH NOT A GREAT MOVIE,THIS FILM DOES HAVE IT'S MOMENTS. PERHAPS THE FUNNIEST SCENE IN THE FILM IS WHEN THAT CANDY BAR IS DROPPED INTO THE POOL AND EVERYBODY THINKS IT'S A TURD."
1,not the clean verson,"I did not realize that there are 2 versions-clean which they show on tv, and a R rated version. We bought this to show my 96 yr old mother in-law. Well, boobs were flashing and language was not good. My husband was really embarassed that I had bought this for him to show her. I guess I did not properly read what version this was. (oh well, this did not help me get any good points with my mother in-law!)"
4,Funny but you have to be 50 to love it!,Description of the viewer who will 100% still like this movie:- likes Animal House- was 17-21 in that period- forgot how we awfully dressed at that time- thought golf players in the 70's were jerks- loves being politically incorrect- was a European exchange student in high school at the end of the seventies somewhere in suburban America and spent at least six months to understand those aspects of the American students culture!It is true that the DVD version is poor quality but it makes it consistent with that period; it feels to be in the seventies all the way through!
4,CADDYSHACK,i HAD SEEN THIS MOVIE YEARS AGO I ORDERED IT TO WATCH AND GET SOME IDEAS FOR A PARTY WE WERE HAVING. I GOT LOTS OF IDEAS AND THE PARTY WAS A SUCCESS.
5,This is a must have movie!,"Every fan of Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, Gold, Comedy, oh hell, anybody should own this movie. Pure comedy classic."
3,"A Great Movie, a medium grade DVD","If you absolutely love ""Caddyshack"", then buy this DVD. It has not been restored, so the color is weak, and for some reason, it's missing the scene where the caddys lock Dr. Beeper's car doors with the keys inside (why?). Standard format only (no widescreen). Dissapointing for DVD. END"
5,The Funniest Ever,"Caddyshack is the funniest movie ever. From Dangerfield's cracks to Murray and the gopher. The movie is supposed to be about a caddy named Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) but nobody really cares about him. Everybody likes the hilarious antics of Rodney Dangerfield, Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, and Ted Knight better. This movie ranks up there with Animal House as an all-time comedy great. You will be reciting the quotes for years."
1,Is this thing supposed to be funny?,"One of the most stupid and boring movies I have ever seen. I am a big fan of comedy, but this is more like a horror movie."
5,Hilarious and moves between the sweet and the raw humor,"There are some situations and dialogue that are not appropriate for some to see and hear, but others will enjoy the ribald humor and the human factor involved as young Danny tries to carve out a future beyond caddying. Great cast, especially Chevy Chase, Knight, and Dangerfield as rivals on the course. And the wonderful Bill Murray steals the show as goofy Carl the groundskeeper."
3,Love the Movie! That will never Change!!,I am a prime member and thought it to be a little strange that a movie this old is not included in the prime pkg. The reason for the 3 stars is that the HD version was $3.99 and froze several times through viewing (on a clear day).
5,"A must for the video collection, every golfer should own it!","If you don't own this movie, BUY IT! If there is one movie that you could watch over and over again, this is it. Not because it is hilarious with so many one liners, but because everytime you see it, it gets funnier and funnier. Bill Murray breaks through and Chevy Chase and Rodney Dangerfield didn't dissapoint. ""Do you do drugs Danny?"" --""Everyday..."" ---""Good"" This was the first movie I bought on DVD and the only feature it had that was a plus was that I didn't have to rewind it. ""Are you going to eat your fat?"" --""SPAULDING!!"""
5,The best and funniest movie ever created,"Caddyshack is the funniest movie ever made. The whole story line is perfect. Every time I watch it, I end up reeling from laughter. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!"
1,5 STAR MOVIE. 1 STAR DVD...,"I AM NOT THE TYPE OF PERSON WHO GIVES A 1 STAR. BUT TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN PAN AND SCAN GOES AGAINST EVERY BONE IN MY BODY. I CONCUR WITH THE PREVIOUS APPAULED VIEWER ON THE DVD TRANSFER. NOBODY, I SAY NOBODY BRINGS OUT A DVD IN PAN AND SCAN AND NOT WIDESCREEN. A TOP NOTCH MOVIE, MIXED WITH A BAD TRANSFER. THAT IS WHY I GIVE THIS MOVIE 1 STAR NOT 5. THIS REVIEW DOES DEFINITLY NOT APPLY TO THE VHS WIDESCREEN EDITION. I DIDNT FORK OUT 1000'S OF DOLLARS TO BUY A WIDESCREEN TV FOR NOTHING!!! GET IT RIGHT NEXT TIME PLEASE. I sincerly apologise for the capitials."
2,One of the best of all time BUT POOR QUALITY DVD,"Most people can't get enough of this movie. I even own it on laserdisc. When I saw that there was a 20th anniversary edition availible on DVD, I had to have it.I am sorely disappointed in the video transfer quality. It lookslike there was just a transfer from VHS to DVD. There doesn't seem to be any attempt to remaster the video and clear it up or improve the audio quality. I recently saw it on HDNet Movies and thought it looked much better.DO buy this movie because it is an all time classic.Don't buy this movie if you think that the 20th Anniversary edition is going to get you anything better."
2,Horrible DVD Transfer,"Any fan of Caddyshack should stay away from this DVD. this is a sad attempt to market a movie without putting any effort into reformatting it for DVD. There is no widescreen, scenes have been deleted, and there are even some wavy artifacts from what appears to be a Video to DVD transfer. Extremely disapointing END"
1,Funniest movie ever - terrible DVD,I have always loved this movie and it was one fo the first DVDs I bought. I sold it almost immediately because the trasfer to DVD is so terrible. It is shame they even bothered making this DVD. I hope they release a widescreen version soon.
2,Nudity unnessary,As silly and funny as this movie could be I don't think it would have ever been a hit without the nudidy. Unnecessary....The sillyness can't stand on its own.
5,A no brainer,"Not just a classic, an all time classic. Chevy Chase and Bill Murray at their best. Rodney Dangerfield is excellent as well. If you are looking at this product you shouldn't even have to read the reviews. Buy It Now!!!"
5,"Classic Comedy - ""It's in the Hole!""","Bought this for my Dad and he couldn't have been happier. He hadn't seen the film since we saw it on cable in the 80's. It holds up and is a must DVD for anybody's collection - the cast, the lines, the gopher."
5,A better understanding that God created Everything,This DVD was well done and well written. The content was easily understandable and provokes more thought on our universe. It is leaving you with wanting more information in the field of astronomy and the Creation of the things in the world.
5,Proof God Exists,"This is a great video to share with believers and non-believers alike! It solidified my own belief that God is, and has always been, actively involved in everything about His creation since the beginning of time."
5,Awesome!,You might think that the presentation is drawn out in this film but the ending makes it all worth while.
5,Ordered as a gift,I know this is an excellent presentation and I ordered it for a friend. I look forward to hearing what he thought of this amazing revelation of science.
5,REALLY ENJOYED,WE REALLY ENJOYED THE CONTENT AND PRESENTATION. EASY TO UNDERSTAND. FASCINATING ASTRONOMICAL TIMELINE WHICH TAKES YOU BACK 2000 YEARS - (THE MOVEMENT OF THE PLANETS IS LIKE CLOCK-WORK) THE COMPUTER SIMULATION AND CALCULATIONS WERE STUNNING. THIS DVD REALLY HELPED US UNDERSTAND A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN WE EXPECTED.
5,The Of Bethlehem Review,"Excellent DVD, well researched and very interesting. The music and video are professionally made with strong Biblical support. The movie flows well and keeps one's attention through it's entirity. I found the general concept and facts believable and backed with Historical as well as scientific information. The author does a good job of using Astromony and modern mathematical models to prove his basic hypothesis. By the end of the video one feels that God and his son are truly the master architects and time keepers of the universe. The Star is about the birth of Christianity and the fulfillment of prophecy."
5,Excellent,"This is a great video to show anytime of the year, not just the end of the year.Believers and non believers will appreciate the work done by the presenter. Not too long and to the point. May need to watch multiple times to appreciate the research..Highly recommended."
5,The Star of Bethlehem,This is a thougtful and wondrous story of God's leading in an individual's life for the good of the world. Love the trailer!
4,Amazing Documentary,This was amazing. Very detailed. Great explanation of the science used. Easily verified. I love that I was transported into the skies and stars of thousands of years ago.
5,The Star of Bethlehem,"The Star of Bethlehem DVD is amazing! The graphics were very good. It took me back to when I was a teenager at the lake and I'd sit and stare at the sky and talk to God. I didn't realize how much God talks to mankind through the graphics he created in the heavens! A lot of thought went into putting this together so everyone can understand. After watching it with my husband, we both sat silent for several minutes taking it all in. We showed it to our bible study group several days later and couldn't help laughing when it was over.....they were all awed and speechless, too!It truly is a MUST SEE...3 or 4 times! Don't miss out, it is amazing!!"
2,dougv,"Good photography and a worthwhile goal to use science facts to support Christianity.Unfortunately, the film is very slow moving. The narrator takes way too long to make his point and he says little ashe presents his case. My profession is teaching, and the average audience would turn him off.The film uses overly dramatic graphics and music, well before he makes his conclusions.Don't spend your money on such a film."
1,borderline hersey,"What do leo, virgo and astrology have to do with the star of Bethlehem?! He had several flaws in this film, too! Jesus was not crucified on good friday! How do I know this? Because the Bible says He was in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights. He rose early the first day of the week (Sunday). So you only have two nights and two days in the grave, not three! Any serious biblical student of the Bible will tell you that! He is over the top dramatic too!"
2,Confusing,"Admittedly, the material presented in the video was fascinating; however, I'm more confused now than before I viewed it. The author/narrator lost me in three places:1. Job is the oldest book in the Bible?2. Christ was born in June?3. Christ died on a Friday?All I do know is the Bible is the truth and this I accept by faith in Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, who came to earth and died on the cross to atone for our sins."
5,Mind Boggling!,"QUITE EYE OPENING and MIND BOGGLING!!! THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM DVD is a prized possession. I have bought and given away several because I feel that it is such an important experience. The investigative presentation and the attention to questions was so very refreshing. I learned a lot and often think about this film which has become a great inspiration in my quest for truth. I highly recommend THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM to everyone! This, along with Ben Steins EXPELLED: NO INTELLIGENCE ALLOWED, are the first things I now offer to share with house guests in the evening. They stimulate interesting discussions and even ardent skeptics find they cannot fault the truths shared in both these earnest projects. I'm truly grateful to have found them."
5,Fantastic Documentary,"Caught a portion of this film on EWTN and thought it was so interesting that I had to purchase the video, at a much lower price on Amazon than at the offical website. Anyone interested in the night sky and the Bible will find this so revealing and astounding. The ability to go back in time and view the night sky from a specific vantage point really gives a remarkable opportunity to see what the people of that day saw. To see what happened with the planets and the happenings within the constellations at the exact dates and hours from the conception of Christ to His crucifiction is amazing. This will make a believer out of the most skeptical. Mr. Larson is genuine, sincere, and shows emotion in his presentation. Truly a must see for all Christians and anyone wanting to see if, at least this portion of the Bible really took place. Best money I ever spent on a video."
1,Very disappointed in DVD!!,"I am very disappointed in the DVD. Not well made. I do believe that the Star of Bethleham was created by God, announcing the birth of our Lord and Savior!"
3,The Star of Bethlehem,"Was not what I expected. I need to view it again. Wanted to use it for my Sunday School class, but feel it is too technical for them."
4,If ever you wondered way the star mattered.,Loved it! Fact filled and wonderfully explained by Mr. Larson in an easy to follow style. Get this video now.
5,Totally blown away,"My daughter saw this video on TBN and wanted me to order it. Then I bought another one. I've seen it at least 5 times, never tire of it.Wow the promise of the Savior was in the skies from the beginning and who would have know it. Since I been lending my out, friends are buying many more to give to friends and this month our Bible study will be the viewing of ""The Star of Bethlehem"" It has been a totally eye opening experience for people of today to see ""this GREAT wonder"" that Fredrick Larson has spent years to delve into and try his best to portray.Totally Awesome!Gretchen from Hemet,Ca."
4,Good but not great presentation.,"I personally saw Rick Larson at a church in Metro Atlanta two years ago give the Star Of Bethlehem presentation. This DVD is a shorter version of that presentation, which captures the essence of the presentation. I would have like for the DVD to include more extras that addressed questions that arise from the presentation. (example:Why does he say Herod the Great died in 1 B.C. not 4 B.C. like most scholars? He should give more background on the Wise Men). Answering these kind of questions would have made the DVD better, in my opinion."
3,Almost but not Quite,I actually enjoyed the film even though I did not find it to be factual about the dates the author was using for the birth of Jesus. I did contact him regarding the descrepancies but he clung to his very loose determinations. I found the astrological parts to be quite fascinating. I enjoyed it but would not recommend it to anyone without letting them know about the date descrepancy.It isn't hard to research the date of the birth of Jesus it is very well documented in History. It was the Emperor Constantine that choose the date of the Winter Solstice for the birthdate of Jesus. Constantine just switched the birthdate of Tamuz the son of the Sun God that the pagans had been celebrating for centuries to the birthdate of the Son of the Creator of the Universe who was actually born during the Feast of Trumpets somewhere between September and October. There are other historical facts that also prove the time of the birth of Jesus but he wasn't interested in hearing about them either.
5,Tremendous,This is the most wonderful and enlightening documentary on the subject of Christmas. You will never approach the Season with questions after viewing this video. Every person should have the opportunity to see it!
5,A strong proof for Christianity. Going beyond just the Star.,"The first half hour is more talking and set-up. The last half-hour is the pay off. Essentially the argument is, according to modern astronomical software where we can plug in the time and date of when we want to look in the sky - we get a date by cross-referencing passages in the Bible as to when X,Y,Z must have occured (Josephus, Jewish calender, a Friday, Sabbath, etc, narrowing the window to a highly specific date) and we see what the Star must have been, and in fact that there was a unique astronomical event in the skies at this time. (and no, it's not really a ""star"" in our venacular, but they would have referred to it as one).Fascinating documentary. And it goes into much more than simply the star itself, but also what happened when Jesus was conceived, and the sign in the sky when he died.Check it out for believers and skeptics alike. At the very least, it's sure to get conversation started."
5,Excellent DVD,"I had been prepared for this DVD prior to viewing it, through a Bible study on the Star of Bethlehem. Therefore, the DVD was a visual reinforcement of the information I had already learned. The facts are well researched and grounded in scripture yet supported by science (and history). The visuals charting the path of the stars and planets are clear and understandable. This DVD helps to clear up many misconceptions concerning the most significant event in human history. Obviously, there is much more to be learned than can be presented here, but it will motivate you to dig deeper."
5,Fascinating!!!!!,"This easy-to-understand, truly fascinating DVD is well worth watching. A true testimony to science bearing out the Bible!!!!!"
5,Star of bethlehem,"Excellent product, Very thought provoking and well done. I would recommend this to anybody that wants to better understand the events in the Bible."
5,Awesome God!,"It is amazing how God designed this universe and from the day of creation, he knew and planned when Jesus would come into the world and when he would be crucified. The evidence is striking and the coincidences are amazing and show that it is more than coincidence.Great movie, would recommend to anyone wanting to strengthen their faith.Would recommend also the the person skeptical of the birth of Jesus."
5,An excellent message of God's amazing grace and hope for mankind!,It is amazing how detailed and precise God is throughout all creation. It leaves you awestruck and encouraged in your faith in the living God and Maker of us all!:)
4,"Good, but...","The topic is really interesting. The first time I watched it, I liked it. The second time I watched it, I fell asleep. Although the topic and information is good, the way it is presented is just ok. The dramatic music is too much to handle.... too loud and distracting. Rick Larson is a likable guy and listening to him lecture is alright, but it gets tiring fast. It's especially slow in the beginning. When I watched it the second time with my kids (Yes, the same time I fell asleep!), I knew what info was coming so I was just hoping they would stick with it long enough for it to get interesting without having to say, ""Wait, it gets better."""
5,amazing,it is a majestic theory of when the world was created its design was for two comets to come together at Jesus birth
4,very informative!,"i had to watch it twice, there was a lot of information . i thought it would be more of a story with more graphics and CGI. it is him giving a lecture at times which seems intimate, but more amaturish in production. awesome mesage check out the bonus feature it will blow your mind , i dont know why they didnt include it with the main feature becuse its AWESOME!"
4,Very thought provoking,"The research for this DVD is extensive and quite convincing. The DVD itself is pretty crude, but well worth the viewing.As a Christian, the star of Bethlehem has always been a ""sticky spot"". Having "" studied"" astronomy some, it just didn't seem possible that something that striking wouldn't have been seen and understood by everyone in that day. Larson explains that well as only someone, like the ""wise men"" who studied the stars would be aware on the intricate workings of the stars.I recommend the DVD to anyone interested in astronomy, and those skeptics who writ off the scriptural truth of Jesus because of the "" impossibilities""."
4,Interesting...,"Our pastor recommended watching this as a family in preparation for the Christmas season. So, unable to make the all-church viewing, I bought one here on amazon. It is interesting - the narrator tells us how God revealed to him and verified that the Star of Bethlehem actually did exist and what the stars revealed about Jesus' birth. No, this isn't the religion of astrology, and the narrator says that over and over again. It is, however, an explanation of all the times in the Bible that mention how God says the stars ""tell of His glory."" It is a bit dull, however, as it is only a videotaped lecture series, given to the narrator's friends and producers, but it is interesting to hear. I would suggest that you watch it but again, children will grow restless during it and I wish that the narrator had taken that into consideration."
5,An awesome choice to show for our devotions!,"We are with a missionary group, traveling in our RV, assisting with construction, remodeling, and even helping make curtains, meals, etc, at camps, conference centers, and churches. Each of us takes a turn throughout the three weeks we are serving, giving a devotion for our group. We found a WONDERFUL tool, the DVD, Star of Bethlehem. Each group we have shown it to, even those that are believers, are astounded at the amount of research that has been done to create this film... and is presented so well, there is NEVER a boring moment, most sit forward in their seats! Some have even asked to see it a second time. (: My husband and I never tire of seeing it, and our grandchildren, ages 2-14 love seeing it again and again! It's a great gift, and perfect evangelism tool."
2,Difficult To Use,I bought this item for my U.S.C.G. 6 pack license course. I was being cost conscious when I purchased it and that was a mistake I could have bought a much nicer divider for just a little more money. This one is hard to adjust and tends to spring back a little after you adjust it. I passed the course but I was truly struggling with this thing on all the charting exercises and testing.
5,The return of one the best dj's ever,"DJ jazzy jeff is one of the best dj/producers around. He has consistently been putting out quality music for years upon years and keeps up his good track record with this current release. Jeff comes with some dope samples, good music and keeps scratching alive. Accompanied by some dope artists this album helps to keep hip hop alive and thriving. The tracks with CL, Big daddy kane, method man, and raheem devaughn are the stand out songs that get played the most in my car. Overall this album gets a big thumbs up and is highly recommended."
5,dope cd,from one of the best out there like i said the new school got the beats but the old school still owns the mouth piece but this cd is the sh-------------t a straight sunroof popped headbanger from you no who oh10 what
4,We talkin bout Practice man!!!,"Which is what a lot of these rappers and producers need because right now Jazzy Jeff is showin cats how its done. This a solid album with a nice blend of new unsigned artist and artist who are vets in the game. Grae, J-Live, Pos, and Raheem D. don't disappoint in their features. Which boost things up as far as my grade. Meth could've had a better track, but Kardnall came through with a hot joint. Chynablac had the worst feature on the album with bad singing and off key lyrics. JAZZ DON'T EVER WAIST A HOT BEAT LIKE THAT AGAIN!!! However, solid album by the most underated DJ in the U.S. Buy this if you want Real Hip Hop."
3,charger portion burns out,"I have owned 2 of these units, and am now unhappy about buying a third, because other chargers and sync cables are more cumbersome to use. The problem I've had (maybe there's something strange in the air in my office?) is that the ability to charge the Samsung unit DIES after a year of use."
3,Scratchy leather,"I really like and enjoy this product, as I am used to being a sub in uncomfortable positions, this gag however had a different problem. The leather parth which touches the sides of your mouth is very sharp and scratchy and caused ""paper-cuts"" on the outside of my mouth. Although fun, I do not think this was an intended result for the gag. It can be easily replace though, with some silk or differnt leather, the tighter you put it on the deeper it cuts, so be careful, its kinda cheap."
2,Get what you pay,This gag has a strong smell and seems like it was designed more as a joke than for actual use. The smell is the plastic releasing a gas.. and it makes me wonder exactly what it is.. I just think of Lead in toys from China. My GF and I used it once and didn't like it at all we got a gag from tantus and love it. Also the leather hurt when it was put on tight. Look elsewhere if you want something to use again and again.
3,it is what it is,"its a gag in ball form. great ""gag"" gift for noisy friends/roommates/gimps in the basement. it'll also do the job its meant for although the strap is a bit thin."
1,Funny,The person right before me had the same problem as I did. He ordered a cross and received the ankh..I ordered the ankh and receieved the cross. I can't say how the ankh looks because i never received it...but as far as the cross it was horrible. It was small and easily bendable. i know it was only fifty dollars but surely you will expect better. I certainly did.
3,very small,"The cross is very small, and is not as pretty and detailed as it appears in the photo. With this said, after seeing the cross I decided it would be better suited for a younger person and decided to give it to my 15 year old niece and she really seemed to like it. Overall, for the price, I am not too disappointed."
5,A very underrated classic!,"Playing Possum wasn't a huge seller when released, and a lot of other Carly fans don't hold the album in high regard today. But I'll tell you this, it's a near masterpiece. After The Storm is a perfect song, about the after effects of intercourse, yes you read that right. Attitude Dancing was the biggest hit, and it's, maybe I say this too much, a lot of fun. But that's one of the many, many great things about Carly, a lot of her songs are just flat-out fun! More And More falls right into that category as well. Slave is outstanding. Many thought Carly was glorifying cultures views on women with this song, when it fact it was completely the other way around. That song itself is a masterpiece! Waterfall is as pleasant as the dictionary definition of the world. Unfortunately, two don't quite do it for me, those two being Are You Ticklish and, oddly enough, the title-track. Their not bad by any means, just not as strong as the first 8 songs. A terrific album!"
2,PLAYING POSSUM MISSES THE MARK,"I have always been a fan of Carly Simon, With her seductive voice and a wry sense of a woman's psyche, Simon gave us some great albums from the 70s into the early nineties, especially with BOYS IN THE ATTIC and COMIN AROUND AGAIN.I initially didn't care much for 1975's PLAYIN POSSUM and now after four decades, I still consider this to be a misfire in Carly's catalogue of material. While there are some flashes of her musical genius, only the spritely addictive ATTITUDE DANCING is truly effective. Perhaps the lyrical content is subpar or maybe Richard Perry's production is too predictable or unimaginative. As noted in fellow reviewers comments, the album's cover is highly erotic and provocative, especially for the 70's....but probably sold lots of albums!Fortunately, Carly would regain her status as one of our finest singer/composers."
2,MIGRAINE IN A BOX,"There are very few toys that I absolutely hate, but this is one of them. ...the game has its good points (such as teaching sharing and taking turns), but they aren't good enough to justify buying this game. There are other great toys that teach the same skills, and don't tempt you to swear in front of your kids. If your kids are absolutely stuck on having this game, I'd recommend stocking up on ibuprofen.And yes, it IS durable. Just what you want in your kids' most obnoxious toy."
3,ANNOYING QUACKING!!!!!!!!!!!,MY KIDS LOVED THIS TOY!!! LEARNING COLORS AND MATCHING... THIS WAS A GREAT TOY. BUT THOSE DUCKS QUACKING AND QUACKING AND QUACKING AND QUACKING ....WAS THE MOST ANNOYING SOUND IN THE WORLD. I DUCT TAPED THE SPEAKER SO IT WOULD DROWN OUT SOME OF NOISE.
4,Lucky Ducks is fun...but LOUD.,"My nephew received this game on Christmas about 7 years ago, I remember he liked it and we all enjoyed playing it with him, so I purchased it for my 3 yr old and she loves it. Not only that, my now 10 year old nephew and his 6 yr old sister love playing with it too. It is a really great children's game, it incorporates aspects of carnival games and learning. But it REALLY needs two things...an on/off switch (other than the ""push"" button in the center) and VOLUME CONTROL. This game is very, very loud and as others have written, it can start easily if anything leans on the box when put away. Other than this, I would recommend this game. My daughter enjoys playing it with others OR by herself, just for fun. My advice, get the game, alternate it with ""quieter"" games and if your kids really like it...stock up on the Excedrin! :)"
4,Very loud!!! But kids love it,"My daughter loves this game and doesn't seem to mind the volume of it. In fact, I think she enjoys all the quacking. She and her friends happily play it in her room (away from me because it gives me a headache!) It would be really nice if there was a volume control button!"
2,"So noisy, so annoying, so boring!",I hate to write bad reviews but I don't want people to waste their $ on this one...the title of my review basically sums it up. My children (2 1/2 and 3 1/2 would rather just sit and talk or ride bikes or stare at the wall then play this one...the only time they take it out to play it is to pretend that their dollies are playing with it during which time they don't even turn that annoying quacking on because even the dollies get annoyed by it.
4,How to TURN OFF the Quacking,"Yes, the quacking can be turned off!! We needed to take out the batteries to travel -- as it was turning itself on during the ride home from Grandma's house. My wife discovered that putting only two of the batteries in turns the ""pond"" but NO QUACKING!PS - It is still loud."
4,For Duckie Lovers,My 17-month-old daughter loves this game!! She is going to receive it for Christmas this year. A friend of ours has this game and she runs for it whenever we visit them!! She loves to hit the button on and off - which allows her to learn cause and effect. She loves the ducks and has learned to turn them over to see different colors. What a great way for your 1-year-old to learn her colors!! She is already saying the colors by name! GREAT TOY!! I do agree--it is quite loud. But what toy does your toddler play with that ISN'T loud???!! P.S. Who's 3-year-old should be stuck playing Risk and learning Alegbra instead of getting dirty in a sandbox????!!! Isn't that what school is FOR?????
4,It's very annoying but the kids like it,"Yes, it's loud and the quacking is obnoxious but the kids really like it. My daughter got it for her 2nd birthday and has enjoyed it since then. We only played once in awhile for my sanity though. :) She's 4 now and too old for it but I'll keep it for my infant son to enjoy.It is what it is.....it's not rocket science so if your 3 year old is doing algebra and playing Risk, (excuse me while I roll my eyes) you should probably not purchase such a simple game and expect him to be challenged by it.Bug"
3,"Loud, annoying, but my son still loves it","I agree with the other reviewers: the loud, constant quacking is extremely annoying and the slightest touch to the top of the box will set it off, BUT, my son absolutely loves the game. Still. Two years after he got it. The 3 star fun rating is an average between his enjoyment of the game and my limited tolerance for the sounds."
2,Not too good!,"""Santa"" brought this toy for my 5 and 3 yr. old. When we put the batteries in, we learned that the spinning part didn't spin without sticking many times per revolution. I called the company and they were kind enough to offer to send a new one free of charge. The new one worked, but again, after a time or two playing, the spinning bottom started sticking. I just gave up on the toy and the kids sometimes play with the ducks."
4,"Fun for the kids, but noisy!!","I bought this game for my 2 year old and she loves to play with this game, even by herself, but it's very noisy. It turns on by an on/off button in the middle of the game, so even if you have it in the box, don't set nothing near it, because the button turns on very easily with a slight touch. But, other than all the quacking, the game is very fun and educational for the kids."
4,Not So Lucky With Ducks,"My four year old loved this game and so did our two year old. However, the two year old peeled some of the eyes off soon after we bought it. Now our kids know the colors of the ducks that lack eyes. This makes it unfair to those unfamiliar to our game, leaving one child asking for a ""recount""."
4,Loud but fun,My 3 year old loves this game! Beware - if it is in the box and you place something on top of it the game will turn on. It is loud and sounds like dogs barking.
3,Lucky Ducks game,"This game is a fun way for a young child to learn the basic colors. My problems with the game are that it is too loud, and when you put the game away you have to make sure it is on top. If anything gets put on top, the pressure turns the duck game on."
3,Noisy duckies appeal to toddlers,"I bought this item used from a thrift store. Have to say it does hold up well. Downfall is the storage, big box, the ducks quack if not placed properly. Since my daughter has her own playroom, noise is not much of an issue, but if you had more confined quarters I could see where this game would be annoying to adults. The game is appealing to those under 4, and they can play by themselves, extremely easy to setup, and play. Educationally it helps to learn colors and take turns. The game is also short for short attention spans."
3,Annoying!!,"I ranked this low on two categories not because it isn't durable, but because it is so annoying. The box is barely big enough to hold the game. If you put it in a closet and set anything at all on top of the box, the ducks start quacking away. You have to always make sure this is the top box and that nothing touches the top of it. I hate it!!"
3,"lucky ducks, unlucky ears",This game has it good points and bad ones. It is a fun game until the child figures out that keeping an eye on the duck you pick lets him know where the ducks are. Also it quacks so loud and doesn't stop that one or two game is all that I can endure. I wouldn't buy this game for a child over 4 years of age because then they get smart enough to figure it out. But for children under 4 it is really a great game if you can stand the quacking.
3,LOUD,"The nice thing about this game is that it is easy, my two year old can play along with my 4 year old, but I must say, I seldom take it out because it is just plain LOUD. There is no volume control and it just KEEPS QUACKING AND QUACKING AND QUACKING. If I had ever been at someones house who had this, I never would have let my daughter get it."
4,A Great First Game,"I bought this game for a 3 yr. old boy, who's just starting to play games. Yes, as so many reviewers stated, it's noisey and annoying. So are most things a 3 yr. old likes. It's not so bad if you play on carpeting or other padded surface. And so many reviewers mentioned the problem of it going off when you put it away in the box. I found a very simple solution. I lay a few ducks on their side in the ""pond"". They're slightly higher than the quack button, so touching the top of the box won't press it. Easier than removing batteries. The only way this game could have been improved is if the ducks eyes and colored bottoms weren't decals. Then he could also play with them in the tub. But I think this game is cute, and recommend it to anyone with a child 2-4 yrs. old."
3,Next time...Read the reviews before you buy,"I purchased the Lucky Ducks game for Christmas for my two daughters one is 4 and the other is 2. The game is cute and fun to play, but I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought the game. This game is very loud and annoying after about 1 minute. I tried putting tape over the holes where the sound comes out of but, it was no help at all, the sound comes out of the entire game. I store the game in the toychest, and whenever I put something else near the game the quacking sound starts and my 2 year old wants to play the game. She loves it!! If there was a volume control or mute button, I would feel much different about the game."
5,"Noisy, but nice","My son received this as a gift for his 3rd birthday. He pulled it right out of the box and started matching the color on the bottom of the ducks to the cards. The sound may get a little annoying at times, but he really seems to enjoy it and i find it to be an educational game. I would recommend this game to others."
4,be quiet ducks!!!!,"I bought this game for my daughter when she was about 20 months old. She has had it about 6 months and still asks to play ducks. It's a cute game, it taught her 4 primary colors. She can't understand the game yet, so instead picks out ducks and matches the colors. So, now the problems. Apparently, the makers of this game never tried to pick up toys and this at the same time. You can't stack toys on the box AT ALL. There is no switch to turn it off, so if something sits on the box, the ducks start quacking. And by quacking, I mean constant. That's the only noise this game makes, and its quite loud (no volume control either). So basically, yes I would buy this game again but only because it is one of the few games a two year old could play. If there were others, I would get them."
4,Great Item :-),Fun and it really tests your knowledge of words. Large vocabulary selection to avoid repitition. Great for long car rides!
1,I HATE it.,"I have played many ""hangman"" games, and was looking forward to ahandheld electronic game I could take with me ""anywhere"". BIGdisappointment. After I dissed it once, decided I really neededto ""try again"" to see if it improved with use.....It did not."
2,Game,"I was disappointed with this game. I thought the letters you guess would be placed in the right position in the word. For example, if the word is ""fox"" and you guess an ""O"" the game would place that letter first. Then if you guessed ""F"" next, it would say OF_. You then had to figure out what the last letter was AND unscramble the word. I purchased another Hangman product I liked much better."
2,It was entertaining for awhile but then it wasn't anymore.,"The game had different levels, but there wasn't much difference. Some of the words were very easy to figure out at first. It didn't have much of a word selection so after you played that caterogrie a few times, you knew what the word was going to be by the number of letters it had. There are about five catergories you can choose from. Like farm animals. The game got boring after about 5 minutes with playing with it."
4,Hangman for Kids,"I purchased this for my kids trip to Texas. We have used them prior to them going and the kids enjoy the game. For an adult it is somewhat easy, even on the 3rd level and 7 letters. But ofcourse it is for kids. I think it is good for the kids for a change they are trying to spell instead of your normal video games!"
3,It's Fine????,"This is an okay game, though it sometimes gets a little boring. This game can teach kids different words. There are 8 categories to choose from, plus you can choose how many letters you want in the game. You get 11 guesses to guess what word they are giving you."
4,Quirky pop band from UK,"You will hear these songs and you will move, believe me, your feet will start tapping and there's definitely nothing you can do about it. The beatles meet the Pixies. Tell the world to listen!!!"
5,Great piano starter book.,"I just started trying to teach myself piano a few months ago using a few books and stuff off the web. I knew nothing about piano or notes. This book gives a lot of tips for someone just starting out and it is interesting and easy to read. I read it once, and now I am going through it again. I am really glad I bought this book."
4,"Great Book for Pianists Wanting to ""Play by Ear""","Having taught piano the ""traditional"" way for 20 years, I bought this book for a student who already played by music but wanted to learn to play off a chord sheet (used a great deal by Christian Praise Bands). Mr. Monath uses very clear terms to describe how to play on the piano basic chords found in most fake books. I have too often found that the pianist who learns by using a traditional piano course method, can't play basic chords or play by ear. This book gives examples of songs to try to play using the right hand melody line and chords. I wouldn't recommend this book for someone who doesn't read music at all, but for anyone who's had traditional piano lessons and can play basic right hand melodies, it's a great way to learn to play chords and fill in from fake books or praise music."
5,The title says it all,"Mr. Monath's book is by far the best I've seen. While other books fail to live up to the promise of their titles, this one does in fact teach you to play. And not only to play but to begin understanding both the piano and music in general. A great introduction for the person who wants to take up the instrument for personal satisfaction and enjoyment. Mr. Monath's book delivers!"
2,Great... if you only have one hand.,"Okay so granted, this book got me started playing piano that sounds a little bit sexier than Baba Black Sheep: Baba Black Sheep with a lot of chords jammed in. But it left me with a lot of questions, like ""Now what?"" and ""Wait a minute, what am I supposed to do with the other hand?"". Maybe I was supposed to use the left hand to play some of the chords in Baba Black Sheep, but that thought only occured to me a year later - after starting on some DIY Jazz for Dummies type books. Wanna play sexy piano? Try Jazz. I suggest ""How to Play Piano Despite Years of Lessons: What Music Is and How to Make It at Home"" by Cannel and Marx (and no you don't need years of lessons, only to know where middle C is and what notes are represented by those line thingies that piano music is written on, which is something you could probably Google), it actually explains to you WHY you are doing x, y and z on the piano... which is of incredible value to beginners."
2,how to play popular piano i 10 easy lessons,a good introduction to playing a piano.easy to follow but got a bit to techinal at the end as if the writer wanted to finish the book .
3,OK but,"Author sort of claims that he has a new way to learn how to play piano but it really is just him explaining how to learn the notes on the keyboard. The key to his method is to play songs you know so that you just play the notes in a tempo that sound right to you. I guess that is one less thing to worry about but if you want to play something that you do not know well, you would be at a loss as to how to play it. I think he could have saved paper and said to just learn what note applies to what key and practice a lot."
1,Not for beginner.,"I found this book is useless.The author had a ridiculous idea that you can play piano with only your right thumb. Maybe a highly skilled pianist can. I can't.It's frustrating to look at the music sheet, to search out where the key is and figure out which finger to use. I throw the book out in the first practice."
5,A great add on to a steller game,".... When you actually get to that phase the game is actually fun. Great missions, great weapns, and great combat. And for people who don't like realsim in their games, don't buy this one, one shot will mostly be likely to kill you 75% of the time, a second shot 24% of the time, and if you ever get down to a third shot your dead."
1,WARNING this game cannot be won,"because of a SERIOUS BUG in the second mission. Here goes, I'm in the installation that I am trying to save from demo, killed almost everyone, but one demolitionist with and AK-47 trying to escape, I've tried over 20 times to kill this guy, single shot, tri-shot, full auto machine gun, sniper, heck even a grenade launched at him and hitting him in his HEAD, and he will NOT DIE!!! I have grown weary with chasing him unloading ALL of my clips into him. I have also grown weary with the freeze-ups, the reboots of my comp, the idiocy of platoon mates, the ace markmanship of the bad-guys on recruit level, the horrid marksmanship of my guys on recruit. Save your money this game needs some serious debugging"
3,Good but could have been better.,I love the original Ghost Recon and fans of the game should pick this game up. There are some thinsg I like and osme things I dislike about this game that keep sme from giving it a better score. I liked the new levels and higher occurance of enemy vehicles. Nothing is as tense as having a vehicle full of gun totting baddies scream around a corner catching you offgaurd. You only get 8 missions which isnt bad considering the orignal was only 15. What I do not like about the games however is the fact that aside from the gun that one new specialists carries you cannot use any of the new guns in single player mode.There are tons of new guns but only available in single player mode. Its a good buy especially if you play alot online but they could hav edone a little more.
4,Good Add-on,"This is a good addition to a great game. The only problem I have with it is that it is too short, but it is about right for the money. Not revolutionary, but I would predict that it will quickly become almost necessary for multiplayer."
5,"More, please!","Where IS this guy? He needs to write more books!I read this ages ago, when it first came out, and remember it like it was yesterday. WONDERFUL book - I fell in love with the the brother's relationship, and Ben, their blind friend who was going to do the night driving. I, too, have recommended it to anyone who would listen. I also gave my brother a copy. Back then, he didn't like to read very much, but he loved this. Who knows - maybe this book is the one which changed his mind about reading.Tim Rumsey, if you're out there, WRITE MORE BOOKS! If you write them, we will read..."
1,Duplicate Titles,"This book is identical with ""The Tale of the 1002nd Night,"" and was simply issued in England under a different title."
5,Good!,"I won't review the plot as others already have done so. I'm not sure why this book got such bad reviews because I really liked it. I picked this one up by mistake and was glad I did. Yes, there were a lot of secondary characters but I found them by and large interesting. I liked the fact that the book wasn't all about one hero and one heroine but a variety of others and opens up the possibility of more books in the series."
5,"Less details, but terrific nonetheless","Less detail oriented than Moving Target, Lowell's new book, Running Scared is still a tour de force! One of my favorite things about these books is the accuracy of details on the interesting and varied ""backgrounds"" (i.e. gems, gold, art, etc.). As with her Donavan series and the previous Rarities opus, Running Scared has it all -- and leaves you wanting more.Query for anyone: Could a book with April Joy as ""heroine"" be in the works -- there are a couple of ""tells"" near the end where Ms. Lowell shows Joy's human-side? And, could the hero be Ian?Don't make us wait too long, Elizabeth.Noiret"
1,Yawn....,"Cookie cutter suspense story with little development of the main characters and their superficial relationship. Little romance or clever dialogue. Secondary characters get most of the attention--a rough, violent, crude bunch. I found it difficult to care about any of them."
2,Fool's Gold?,"This is my last Elizabeth Lowell book. Her formula simply doesn't work for me, basically too much suspenseful dashing about, shallow characters that have been assigned gorgeous bodies to go with their incredible brains, explicit and gratuitous sex, along with a little bit of obscure research on are/precious/historical objects. Yes, I finished the book but I'm still trying to figure out why. A mindlessly commercial effort."
3,Running Scared,"I enjoyed both Running Scared and its predecessor, Moving Target. The Author does a good job of exploring the senses and thought processes of her characters, as well as whetting the reader's curiosity about interesting topics such as antiquities. But buy the printed book, not the audio version; the Reader consistently mispronounces names, which drove me to give my set away after the first twenty minutes."
1,not her best work,The story line is good however she doesn't develop the realtionships between people and it frizzles out really quick.
1,Boring,This book is one of the worst books I have ever read in my life. It started off ok but it dragged on and the suspence was missing to keep me reading. I tried very hard to read this book but it was so boring I kept on falling asleep.
1,Running Scared had me just plain running,"I eagerly awaited Running Scared because of the fact that I loved Ms. Lowell's earlier works(Autumn Lover, Winter Fire, Untamed, Forbidden, Enchanted, Moving Target) just to name a few). She became an auto-buy for me. Until this one. I found that I couldn't even get past the first few pages. The characterization and dialogue were weak. Ms. Lowell was definitely ""off"" on this one. I recommend any of her earlier works like the ones mentioned above in addition to Amber Beach, Jade Island, Midnight in Ruby Bayou, To the Ends of the Earth."
1,silly,"I chose this as one of my ... free books, boy do I wish I could give it back. Silly inane dialog made up of sexual inunendos, dont' waste your money on this one."
2,Just OK - More Anne Maxwell than Elizabeth Lowell,"Being a long time fan of Ms. Lowell's I have been slightly disappointed with the Rarities series. While the ultimate plot of this book is okay, I feel that classic Lowell characterization is lacking. Ms. Lowell is generally very good at drawing readers into a story but, once drawn in, there is nothing to hold your attention to this story. I greatly missed her usual in-depth approach to writing about characters. I felt that in this story she was merely telling a story. Using the characters as simple vessels instead of attempting to bring them to life. For example, I would have liked to learn more about what made Shane and Risa unique as individuals. That more indepth characterization combined with the over all plot would have made a much better novel."
5,Great family fun!,"We have 3 kids, ages 5, 8 and 10, and we can play this game together. There are 2 levels of clue difficulty, so that helps us customize it based on what our kids can do. My 5yo plays on a team with an adult to help him along, but we are amazed at how well he can do. He just needs someone from the other team to read and whisper the clue to him and give him an idea of how to draw it. We haven't been able to find this game in stores and so we were very happy to find it here on Amazon. Highly recommended!"
4,Why did they stop making this game? It's great!,"We bought this game after playing the adult version at a friend's house. While playing it we realized how much it was helping our 5 year old son with speech challenges communicate through his drawings. He's not a big drawer and doesn't have much confidence in his drawings. Since we've been playing the Jr version he has gotten much better and he has a good time drawing and having fun. Also, since he can't really read much yet playing in teams is good so someone who is not guessing can help him with what the word on the card is and give him some hints on how to draw it. The whole family enjoys the game. Why did they stop making it?"
3,plenty fun,My little niece has this so I've played it and it can be just as fun as the older version.
1,False photo,"The photo shows a whole box of jars, but they're only selling one. Don't be fooled by these jokers."
1,False Ad,"I was also fooled by the picture of more than one jar. Sorry, but you won't get another order from me."
1,I am not alone!,"I am sooo glad I am not alone in thinking I was getting more than 1 spice jar!OUCH! Granted it is a lovely spice jar, the thing cost me more than $8.00.I really think the seller needs to me more specific in what the customer is purchasing.They should take the plurality out of ""jars"" and make it just a ""3 ounce replacementjar""."
1,Miss Leading,Very misleading photo it shows a flat of 12 spice jars and they ony ship one at a cost of $7.79I could have bought a full flat at bed bath and beyond (12 jars for $23.88 a cost of $1.99 each).I would never have bought them for their price if they would have followed truth in advertisingin their Photo!!
3,Read before you buy.,This wasn't what I expected. That was due to the fact I didn't read the complete description of the item before I purchased it.
5,great for art theorists and paper writing!,"This book contains several essential essays for anyone studying contemporary art theory. It is an extremely theoretical book, not to be undertaken lightly. It would help if you had a basic background in some theoretical discourse.As a graduate student, I have used it in several of my theory classes, and it has proven to be extremely helpful in writing papers."
5,Looooooving it,Always been a great fan of the TV Series and watched all episodes for several times already.This Poster matches them so well and it's outstanding quality too.Would definitely recommend to anyone who loves them
2,Maybe a little too cryptic?,"People's tastes vary. Speaking only for myself, I like cryptic crosswords that are solved with the standard rules, as opposed to cryptics featuring specially invented rules (e.g., the answers are to be filled in backward, or with certain letters displaced or omitted, or with parts of words exchanged for parts of other words elsewhere in the grid). At least half the puzzles in this collection are oddball specimens of this type. If you're bored with regular cryptics and want a greater challenge, you'll love this book. If you prefer your cryptics ""straight,"" there are better choices."
5,Funniest book ever written,"I read this back in the early 60's when I was about 14 or so. I am still laughing. You will not believe the way this guy writes.It is indescribable. If you are lucky enough to come upon a copy, buy it. You will be so glad you did. Bruce Jay Friedman is a national treasure. His take on life is at first glance quite askew..but, upon further reading, you will find that he ""writes"" like you ""think."" I've never experienced this with any other writer. Check out his other books, as well...especially the Lonely Guy's book of Life."
3,With a little patience this tool can do the job,"This tool is ideal to tighten the typical large 3 inch nut used underneath the sink to connect the sink drain and plumbing. The tool is composed of 2 pieces of metal. One is the movable 1/2 of the head while the other half is composed of the handle and the other part of the head. Where these 2 pieces come together is loose. When tightening the nut, you will need to hold the pieces together. With a little of patience in holding the tool together plus tightening the nut the job can get done."
3,"Flimsy, but does the job.","I rebuilt my old toilet with this, and used it for the real huge plastic nut between the toilet tank and base, and it worked fine. I also used it for a few other things, but I mainly just bought it to do the toilet and the kitchen sink. It is a little weird to get adjusted, but it locks in place, and does the job. Great for someone who only wants to use a tool like this twice in their lifetime and doesn't want to spend a lot of money or is stretching a renovation budget."
1,Low quality tool,"I purchased this wrench for a 3"" nut on a packing gland assembly, At 3 inches the jaws don't get a good grip to torque the nut properly. Had to revert back to the groove lock pliers."
4,"FUNKY FEEL GOOD VIBES, YOU KNOW THE REST!","THIS IS ONE OF THE RECENT REISSUE ALBUM'S FROM IKE & TINA. IT WAS RECORDED IN 1973, DURING THEIR DARKEST HOUR PRIVATELY, BUT AT ONE OF THE DUO'S FUNKIEST MUSIC MOMENTS. THEY HAD JUST RELEASED THEIR LAST HIT TOGETHER, TINA'S LOVING TRIBUTE TO HER GIRLHOOD ROOTS, 'NUTBUSH CITY LIMITS'. THEIR RELATIONSHIP WAS IN RUIN AND TINA HAD ONE FOOT OUT THE DOOR AND THE OTHER LOCKED IN THEIR BOLIC SOUND STUDIO. THERE IS A COUPLE OF TRACKS THAT JUST FEATURE IKE ON VOCALS, BUT I PREFER THE TINA/IKETTE VOICE THICK TUNES. I LOOOOOOVE 'WALK WITH ME' AND 'AMAZING GRACE' I MEAN THEY HAVE SOUL AND FUNK PRAISE. I VISIT TINA'S GIRLHOOD CHURCH IN NUTBUSH EACH YEAR AND I PLAN TO PLAY THIS CD NEXT YEAR AS PART OF OUR 'ANNUAL TINA FAN FEST'. 'WHEN THE SAINTS GO MARCHING ON' AND 'WHAT A FRIEND WE HAVE IN JESUS' ARE OTHER STAND OUTS. GET THIS CD TODAY AND ENJOY, CRINGE, WHATEVER BUT IT IS A REISSUE."
3,mediocre album finally available on CD,"Contains some good vocals by Tina, especially ""Glory, Glory"" and ""Nearer the cross"". Ike's vocals sound not so good and the music is arranged in a strange way.Maybe Ike 's addiction to cocaine had something to do with it...Recorded at Bolic sound studios in 1973 and now for the first time ever on CD. Thanks EMI !!! Now all their other albums please."
4,I can dream!,"I was not able to fit the side trip to Paris into my travel plans. I keep the book on a shelf where I can look up at it. I stare at the title ""Paris"" and dream of making that trip there some day."
5,Rick Steves Paris 2008,"After trying several....no, actually A LOT of other guide books over the years, Rick Steves is the only one I use now. I went to Paris in May of 2008 and I can't tell you how much I would have missed if hadn't used his book. It's a great guide book, but it's also a real treat to read; funny, witty, a little wicked. He goes into the history of the area without coming across as preachy or boring.Needless to say, I would recommend this guide book over all the others.Renee Wilson"
2,Not what I expected,"This guide book to Paris is OK. There are much better books on Paris. Rick Steves spends most of this book telling , in great detail, all about the museums. He hardly mentions any restaurants or hotels.I have his books on Italy and they are much better written than this one on Paris.I really considered sending this one back. It is really useless."
4,Helpful Guide,"This was extremely helpful for my trip to Paris and helped me plan my trip. There were a few areas that were sketchy and incorrect but overall, this was the best guide for my six day trip to Paris. In fact, I saw many Americans with the 2007 version - so I know this is the guide to use."
5,Organized and Percise,"I have used Rick Steves in the past and I like the manner in which he guides the reader not only through the city but specifically through each site. He have great tips for places to stay, eat, and just general travel tips for those who are not as savvy in European travel as he.Each section is well organized and up-to-date. Also, he gives great history of each monument and what each little detail means. Moreoever, I love the walking tours. Such a great idea. Furthermore, his tour of the Louvre is on the money. I used him instead of anything else and I enjoyed my day there.Arc de Triomphe, La Tour Eiffel, La Seine, Le Louvre, Notre-Dame, Quartier Latin, Montmatre all were enjoyed thouroughly because of this guide.A definite recommend and gift to anyone going to Paris. I even use it when need to give a quick blerb about the history of a monument since Rick is able to it so quickly rather than drone on for pages.Bon séjour à Paris"
2,Very general and vague,"You definitely can not take just this book with you to Paris. After reading it and then the Frommer's Paris guidebook, I regret the money I wasted buying this. The pros to this book are that it is thin and therefore portable, and it has excellent Museum and tours and self-guided walks. The cons to this book are that it has few restaurant and accomodation listings(hence the thinness), and often the listings don't actually have the written down addresses, just walking directions from the Métro. Why spend more money buying this guide and the others you'll need when you can just buy one? Try buying the Frommer's or Fodor's instead."
5,Rick Steves is the best travel companion you could have.,"He's amazing. I walked in to a travel agency one day and decided it was time to make sure I fulfilled my girlhood wish to go to Paris. So I bought a roundtrip ticket, went to a bookstore and started to plan. I was quickly overwhelmed and frightened. Sure, other guidebooks list every hotel in the city, but how would I know where I wanted to stay? I knew I wanted to go to the Louvre, but it's a friggin' huge place--where does one begin? Thankfully, a friend recommended I look into Rick Steves. It was the best travel advice I have received; Steves helped make my trip incredible. No other guidebook can compare."
5,Must read for those who want to see and feel the REAL Paris,Excellent guide book for those with a week available to visit the most celebrated city in the World. A must read for anybody who never been to Paris before. Money saver too!. Standing ovation to Rick Steves.
1,How to be an American in Paris,I've lived in Paris and visited the city on countless occaisions - and I contantly see Americans in their new white tennis shoes traipsing round the city with a copy of Rick Steve. It's obviously a popular guide and does a great job of showing you how to be a tourist in the city.Buy a different guide book like the Rough Guide to Paris or Lonely Planet and then you won't be in a restaurant with a whole load of other Americans!
4,"A good buy, but shouldn't be your only guide.","My wife and I used Rick's book extensively while in Paris. It had many great tricks and tips about getting around Paris. Escpecially the Museums and such. But this should not be the only book that you bring. I would highly recommend Eyewitness Paris guide or Fodor's to complement Rick's book. Both have more detailed information and maps about the Metro\RER. One word of caution. Most of the Hotels and Restaraunts that are recommended in Rick's book are swamped with Rick Steve's groupies clutching his book under their arms, especially the Rue Cler area. I didn't care for all the Americans, but some people didn't mind..."
5,Don't go unescorted without it!,"We just returned from the City of Light with a very dog-eared copy of this book. We used it every day. We used all of the recommended walking tours - they were filled with informative commentary and easy to follow. We dreaded trying to conquer the Louvre - were intimidated by the size alone! - but Rick's guide allowed us to hit the highlights with ease. His tours of the other big museums and Versailles are excellent - interesting, funny and just irreverent enough to keep you entertained. If you are going to Paris without a personal guide, this is THE printed guide to take!"
3,"Great for a Beginner, Lousy for Something New","This book is undoubtedly one of the best if you are a first time Paris traveler. We are making our fifth journey and were hopeful to find something out of the ordinary -- it is not here. This gives you the basics, but nothing more..."
2,Beware!!,Rick Steves books are definitely overrated. Amazon had several reviews of positive ratings for his books. I would not recommend any of his books. His Paris travel book is modest at best.It does not offer direct and clear picture of Paris. His major weakness is the lack of good detailed maps. Do not buy this book. In Paris you can easily get free street and metro maps.Not only are they free but very practical.
5,Rick Steves' Paris 2006,This book was excellent. I recently went on a trip to Paris and London and purchased both books by Rick Steves. If I were planning another trip and his books were available I would definitely purchase them. They are easy to read and have everything set out in catagories. His information is well organized and very indepth. This is a definite in my trip planning list.
5,Must Have!,"I thought this book was really helpful. The maps were great, just wish we had studied them a little more before we went! We had a great time in Paris and took the book with us everywhere we went. It helped us decide (before we went) which sights to see and which to leave out since our time in Paris was short. It also made it easier to find things and get around without wasting a bunch of time going the wrong way. We wouldn't have known about the museum pass without it!--Ember"
4,A must for the people who are trying to get finances managed,"You will gain a lot, there is a great deal of information in this book, If you have decided to put your financial life back together this is the starting point. A MUST for the people who need help."
2,Outdated and shallow for credit repair,This book is well written but was written in 1998. I was looking for a book that would increase my credit repair skills as I sell real estate and sometimes help clients or direct them to good materials for information. I do not recomend this book for credit repair as the information is shallow and out dated. It does have some good financial infomation however.
4,TRACK LISTING,"1. Albert's House 2. Farewell, San Francisco 3. Time 4. I Should Have Told You So 5. How Dare You, Sir 6. End of the Line 7. Pretty People 8. Sunday in Town 9. Man Who Used to Be 10. Never Had This Feeling Before 11. Life 12. Nice Little Girls"
4,The New American Diet Cookbook; More Than 200 Very Low Fat/H,"I'm really interested in cooking so that i was attractive by this New American Diet Cookbook. The recipes of very low fat and high flavour foods included in the book highly motivated me to try to follow them to prepare those foods for my loved ones and myself. Since we are health-concerned, those recipes presented in the book can fulfill our needs to achieve excellent health conditions with good flavour provided simultaneously. Moreover, there are varieties of recipes to well suit your taste and even to try new favourite dishes from many countries like Thailand, Greece, Italy, and many more. I strongly believe that most of you are looking for this kind of cook book as well. So do not hesitate to select this book and enjoy following those delicious recipes ! And you will ultimately be proud of yourself possessing both healthy body and healthy mind !"
1,Not A Good Cookbook,This cookbook does not much sustenance it is no a good cookbook. Buyer beware! I would not recommend this book as a source for good cooking.
5,This CD is visceral and folky.,I love this CD. It is very short but I have had it on heavy rotation for the last couple of months. Its fun and its sad and you can dance to it and you can sing out loud to it. I heard about it from some friends from West Virginia and I am so glad that I did. Kathy McCarty is from Glass Eye so that is my next stop on this musical journey. My favorite songs are love wheel and sorry entertainer. If you like folky music that isn't too folky and a little more rocking but you don't want to hear it as background music for the next breakup scene from Melrose Place then get this CD.
1,Bad,"This one is the very first book I've bought years ago when I decided to give veganism a try and it may be considered one of the worst I'd have chosen, the recipes are full of diary substitutes, too salty and unappealing."
5,A must have for any animal rights supporter.,"Now this isn't my favorite vegan cookbook. And to be honest almost all these recipes can be found on the peta website. But I think it is a classic. I use the book once in awhile, but once I do a recipe i can pretty much wing it (except the desserts) This is a book you should get because it is helping support peta. It also has bios from vegetarian celebrities with pictures and how they became vegetarian. It would actually be a really good coffee table book. I haven't had any trouble with the book falling apart, but because it doesn't have many recipes (less than 80) it isn't my most used cookbook. All the recipes are very simple with easy ingredients to find. I think this cookbook is a must!"
3,Great intro to vegan cuisine / Not so comprehensive,"Stunningly designed - this book is a great introduction to vegan cuisine. There is a great assortment of recipes, many of which are easy to prepare. While I enjoyed the flashy design - I wonder if the amount of recipes inside makes it worth the price. A better choice might be PETA's earlier cookbook ""The Compassionate Cook"" - it doesn't have pictures but there are far more recipes which are easy to prepare and it's sure to become a book that you'll rely on daily."
3,"Great pictures and quotes, long ingredient lists","Looking for a good vegan cookbook and totally loving PETA, I jumped at this book as soon as I found it. It arrived and I was very excited to get it! However, I also was very disappointed. There are great pictures in here and I loved the quotes and quick facts, but as for being an everyday cookbook that I'd use...not so sure about that. The ingredient lists are very long and I just couldn't imagine my family eating this food. But I would imagine it being a good cookbook for a fancy get together. So it really just depends on what you're looking for."
4,"Great guide, but has bad language in it","I'm not a kid, I just didn't want to reveal my account. Anyway, this is a very thorough guide and includes everything but the sinking lure, but the author uses the words d**n, cr*p, a**, and p*ssed throughout the book. This may not be a good choice for younger children."
4,I hate to do this!!,"I hate to do this to a product that deals with Zelda but, I must make this comment. The book was ok, but it got me lost many times. The pictures in the book are great as well as the 2 included posters (perfect idea to scan for destop background; if you have a scanner). Over all the text will take some time to dicipher while playing the game. The good part about the text is that it tells you what order you need to complete the dungens and alternitave routes. It also tells how to acomplish the extras: miny games, extra items, ect. It also tells a good part of the story line."
4,A Mom Buys it a Second Time It's That Good,"I am buying this book for a second time. We started the book when my son was 6, couldn't read yet, so I read it to him and helped him through the game. It was thorough, creative, and very humorous writing that I enjoyed using with my son. Now that my son is 7 and can read it for himself, he has used it so much that the book is in tatters. I think the book is very beautiful to look at, and indeed, worth having in newer condition, so I am buying it again. I would have given it 5 stars except for, like the other commentator, the swearing (I am, after all, a mom)."
2,not good don't buy,This book is very damaged and the map is not even in it!! VERY unhappy with what I paid for!!!!
3,"O.K, Great, O.K","It was O.k. I used it alot, but I did not like the lauguage (swearing) used in the book. I though for thouroughness, it was O.Kish. Sometimes I would get confused. If you had descibed the terrain, and souroundings a little more, it would have been better. Your forest temple section was horrible."
5,this book is DA'BOMB,"versus is the way to go.this book is easy to read and find what you were looking for.{i couldn't find the fire arrows and i found them in this book in about 5 secomds}doesn't ruin storline,good strategies,and updates for whenrveryou get a new weapon it tells what to get with it"
4,Become a POD Power User!,"First of all... I think I learned more about the POD from the introduction of this book than I did from reading the manual that came with the POD. I got better results in the studio after reading info in this book than I had since owning the POD. I'm not much for playing other people's music and trying to sound ""just-like-them""... however, in the studio, I get clients that say... ""I would like my guitar sound like this song or that song."" Well, this book gives you the ingredients to get a big variety of sounds. From what you plug the POD into, to the needed adjustments to get a particular sound. Then just tweak it from there. At the price on amazon.com, you won't regret having this book."
4,An enjoyable listen,"I would have given this audio book 5 stars except that I thought Jim Dale's narrations of the Harry Potter books and ""Around the World in 80 Days"" were better. But compared to other audio books *not* narrated by Jim Dale, it is definitely 5 stars.Jim Dale is a gifted narrator who uses distinct voices for each of the characters (though I don't think he does as well with female voices), which is both entertaining and helpful in keeping the dialogue straight while listening.I'm hoping one of the audiobook companies will hire him to record some of the other British classic novels like Treasure Island or Kidnapped by Robert Louis Stevenson or more of the Jules Verne novels."
2,Find Peter Pan with a different reader,"Tim Curry is a great actor, but he does not shine in this audiobook. He is never lively or fun in this, but instead intones each word ominously. He is not very good at doing different voices, and is particularly unskilled at female voices.There are other unabridged versions of Peter Pan on audiobooks -- I encourage you to find a different reader if you and your children want to really enjoy the book."
2,"Awful characters, can't imagine why it was such a hit","eBook downloaded from Gutenberg. Three children disappear from their odd English home, so little Wendy can mother the Lost Boys of Neverland.I had never read this childhood classic and was surprised to learn that Peter was manipulative and selfish and Tinker Bell was obsessively jealous of Peter. This Gutenberg file includes definitions of words children may not know. The problem is that not all the definitions are correct. Sanguinary, for instance, was mis-defined as happy rather than bloody. Nor is the story focused, but rather wanders from one event to another. Although I have enjoyed many children's classics as an adult, I was not impressed with the plot or characters in this book."
4,"Basic copy, good for new readers.","I have always loved Peter Pan when my son started reading chapter books, I knew I wanted him to read Peter Pan but I didn't want him to read my nice, expensive, leather bound copy that my great aunt brought me from London when I was a kid. I looked into getting a cheap copy of Peter Pan for him and settled on the Dover Evergreen Classic edition. It's nothing fancy, there's no pictures or anything like that but for a new reader, who isn't interested in taking good care of his books, this edition is perfect. It's a sturdy paperback that has made it through many trips to school and camp without too much catastrophic damage. If you are interested in a fancy collectable edition then this isn't for you. If you just want a basic copy this is perfect."
1,I had a shock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Today we got a book""Peter Pan"",it is very old,the first page hardly kept with other pages,but the most interesting was next!!!!I FoUND SOMEONES HAIR INSIDE,when we decided to read it!It IS DISGUSTInG!!!!!"
3,Peter Pan is a good book for kids and adults alike.,"Peter Pan is a good adventure/fantasy that kids and adults can enjoy alike. With much exaggeration, it is something kids can enjoy and read into. It's a page-turning book that once you started you can't stop."
5,A Classic!,"A beautiful edition of a wonderful story. Peter Pan is a very fun read, even if Peter himself is not as lovable as his animated counterpart. Quality binding, cover, and pages; attractive and easy to read type; beautiful illustrations."
5,Flying,A beautiful presentation of one of the all time great stories. This is a book for any person of any age.
2,disappointed,"I've just purchased this book for my 3 year old grandson. Very, very disappointed to find that it is the same as I had already downloaded free! and not a single illustration. What a waste of money. I don't think a 3 year old will sit through a book of this length when there are no pictures."
5,Don't be satisfied with the Disney version.,"I got this book as a gift, and was utterly charmed! There's nothing like reading the original story for yourself. ^_^Not only is the story great, but the physical book itself is lovely, with great pics and wonderfully smooth pages."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,This book did not come with the illustrations as is advertised in the pictures. Misleading and not as actually shown in pictures.
4,Peter Pan review,"My favourite part of the book was when Peter Pan teased the mermaids in the lagoon by letting Wendy swim.I liked Peter Pan because it is one of my favourite fairy tales.It's an adventure story.I think other people should read Peter Pan because it is a fun story and also because the book is so much different than the......CARTOON NETWORK version.My favourite character is Wendy Darling because I do remember her tellingstories about.....Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Hook, the Mermaids and the Lost Boys."
4,A Little Scary!,"This isn't like the Disney movie! I loved this book but at the same time I was shocked by the violence of the fighting between Hook and the Lost Boys and the Indians. I don't think I'll be reading this one to my nephews and neices, not until I have edited out the violent bits. It wasn't that In-Your-Face violence of the Hollywood movies, it was more insinuated and there was definetly a menacing atmosphere surrounding Wendy's, Peter's and Michael's adventures in Never Never Land. I do recommend it though, just not for easily frightened youngsters. This is definetly in need of a PG rating on the cover. PARENTS: This is no Disney Peter Pan!"
5,Who Doesn't Love Peter Pan?,"I'm kind of surprised I liked this book so much as a child, because reading it many years later, it really is written for adults, in an adult fashion. But perhaps that's a sign of how many young adult books have been dumbed down. Compare the trilogy The White Mountains versus The Hunger Games, for example.The review here said: ""This [Kindle] series entry presents Barrie's original text, minus a brief section in the first chapter in which Mr. and Mrs. Darling discuss whether they can afford to keep their three offspring.""I bought the Kindle book, and that section was not missing from my version, so perhaps the reviewer had an earlier or different version."
5,Beautiful book!,"This is a beautiful book! I originally bought this for my boyfriend, he loves Peter Pan. He is 19. I am actually going to keep it for myself because when it arrived I realized its a little girly...to give to him. So I'm buying him a different version. but i love it!"
1,Very poor service,"I very seldom received an issue of the magazine. I renewed my subscription against my better jusgment and received a total of one (1) magazine during an eight month period yet received another renewal form. They did send me a check for issues I never received. It is a very good magazine, but it is much easier and less frustrating to buy directly off the newsstand. Wal-Mart carries the magazine, so I can obtain the magazine on a regular basis."
1,The magazine is fine...if you get it!,"I subscribed to this magazine last year for Father's Day for my husband, and we've only received 1 magazine!Like the previous poster said, good luck on finding a phone number!My husband does like the magazine however."
2,Just O.K.,"Let Natcom get your address and you'll need a bigger mailbox. Every few weeks they send you a notice telling you that you need to renew your subscription. If you get any of their other pubs, and have been getting them for a while, you'll need a tracking system to know when you REALLY need to renew. Their magazines are just o.k. so I won't be renewing because I'm sick of their harassment. Oh, don't expect to find a phone # for customer service either. Check out the In-fisherman pubs and their ""Crappie Wisdom"", ""Bass Wisdom"", etc for a thorough and professional presentation of useful info and illustrations. Happy Hookin'!"
4,Good Crappie Magazine,This is a great crappie magazine. It does come sporatically. One month we received 3 magazines and haven't recieved one now for 3 months. If you don't mind the inconsistancy the magazine is great.
1,Don't Return Emails,"Wrote this company twice via email with customer service concerns, set the emails up to send a receipt when opened, got back 2 receipts but no response from customer service.Huh. Imagine."
3,Poor battery compartment door design,"I have an older pair of Motorola radios. Decided to get two more and went with a pair of T5420. Everything is great EXCEPT I see that the battery door design is now different and more flimsy. BOTH of my units had the same problem. Mine came with a rechargeable battery pack. With the battery pack installed, a tap on the back of the battery door with a finger makes it pop off. My kids wouldn't make it out of the front yard without it falling off. It would probably work better with normal AA alkaline batteries, but why supply a battery pack and charger if I can't really use it. Other than the battery door, good product. But because of that, I'm returning mine."
3,"Good for home use, or short communication in the city.","I bought the pair of these radios hoping for a 1/4-1/2 mile range in the city. In my neighborhood, which has trees and is on a slight hill, I don't get that. If you want an intercom to keep in touch with someone at an event when you are separated, or doing work when two of you are not in the same location and you have to coordinate activities and you are nearby, ok. But I was disappointed that I couldn't use this like a cell phone at the range stated..."
4,Great for road trips....,"Took these on a little road trip from New York to Florida..they worked great and allowed us to communicate from a decent distance between the two cars.The only downside is that these are popular and often times you will pick up other people. The solution is to just change to a different frequency, otherwise a great buy at this price."
4,2-Way Radio,This set works well and voices come in clear. I keep one in house and husband keeps one on him while on the farm.
1,piece of junk,"I'd rate this a 1 star, but I didn't only because maybe I didnt understand what these radios are all about.Here on the north side of Chicago, these radios were unable to establish contact over a distance of 4 blocks. Repeated calls back and forth to the other party, while they walked this 4 blocks, gave extremely disappointing results.Maybe its because traffic is really heavy, but I still find this unacceptable. It really only worked well up to about 2 blocks away.The radio automatically comes on with channel 1, subchannel 1 selected. There were no others on that channel. I manually scanned all 14 channels and found almost no one else on these frequencies. Maybe these radios just aren't for city use. I think they stink. I avoided giving a worse rating only because I don't want to scare people away. One woman says she uses it to call her husband working in the yard. I'm pretty sure it can handle that task. But not much more."
1,This Digital Photo Viewer is trash!,"Totally dissapointed.I bought this item as a result of the previous reviews shown here, and what a dissapointment it really is. The image quality is absolutely terrible. The screen flickers, has a verry narrow field of view.....meaning, you have to be looking at it head on in order to see anything at all.I wouldn't purchase this item, and I don't recommend you do!"
4,what you see is what you pay..,"It's not as sharp as a HDTV, fair enough for less than $60my 2 1/2 years old twin girls can operate it what makes me morehappy. Really good for my $59 if I would a better performance I'llmaybe spend more than $150.I'm really happy with this item."
3,Great for the price. Lacks on the viewing space.,The quality of the image is great! The only problem I see with it is that the frame does not take advantage of the whole screen. There are always black areas on the screen that the pictures don't get to use.
5,Great product,This made for a great gift for my dad. I would recommend it because of the picture quality and ease of use.
1,Save your money,"I thought this was great for a week. After that, pictures are blury, the brightness is missing the ""bright"" in it and it flickers. No refund was offered. I would never buy a AXION product again. Poor customer service and no tech support."
2,Poor viewing angle,"Luckily, I received one of these as a company gift instead paying for it with my own money. The display is an odd size and has almost no viewing angle -- you pretty much have to view the pictures from a perpendicular angle."
2,Didn't work,"This unit worked OK for about an hour, then wouldn't read any SD cards. On the good side, they took it back and refunded my money with no problems."
4,"Quirky, interesting take on Irish music","Peadar, son of the great Sean O'Riada, directs the famous Cul Aodh choir in the Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking region) of West Cork. This album will appeal to you if you like honesty and intelligence in Irish traditional music. He takes everything from kids messing around on the piano to birdsong to the Cul Aodh choir and creates an album that has great freshness and atmosphere. Yet the songs themselves may be familiar to those who know the work of Iarla O'Lionaird (Afro-Celt Sound System), old Irish tunes given oxygen. Well worth a listen when in a contemplative mood with a fresh breeze coming in the window."
2,Just fair for the price.,"The item was not in the best shape, compared to the description. It also had a hard time load into my itunes account because of a glich."
1,Lil Cease stole 4 My Niggaz from 2pac,Lil cease stole 4 My Niggaz from one of 2pac's unreleased bootleg albums
2,Big Dissapointment,"I thought this album was very dissapointing. It only has a few decent songs, the best one being ""Play Around"". On one song, kelly price sings the chorus, which is stolen from a mary j. blige song. and another song's chorus is stolen from master p's i'm a ho. most of the beats on this tape aer tired & weak. and lil cease cant even hardly talk clear. lil cease's voice makes him sound like he weighs 600 ponds, cuz he just mumbles, like his mouth is overflowing with spit.this album sucks, but to each his own, so you'll have to check it out yourself."
1,Are You Kidding Me?,"Okay, I must admit that I prejudged this cd before I ever listened to it.But then I listened to it and now I know why.IT'S SO COMPLETELY WACK.If anyone could take hot garbage and put it to music,it would be this guy.I'm sure Biggie would be so ashamed to know thathis name is even mentioned on this CD.Take a listen to that last track again.LOL! He actually thinks that we're impressed by him playing samplesof Big Poppa dissing him every chance he had.""Throw the keys to Lil Cease to pull the truck up front""""Cease know all his h@e$ go to my door, then they go to his floor to f&*# some more""Wow. And this makes you a good old fashioned yes man.The only thing close to this mess,is the other hip hop son-of-a-true-artist Memphis Bleek.Sidekicks are definitely not what's hot.I'll tell you what,customers should be compensated for even allowing this trash to be a part of their collection."
4,i think this cd is ok not my favorite one but i like it.,this cd is good and all that but i think Lil' Cease could of done better. I hope his next cd is better. When it out i'll buy it . See Ya All!
1,"A good magazine article, a mediocre book","The title and subtitle were compelling, so I sat down with this book for a few hours in a local bookstore. It wasn't long before I realized that the book had a lot of ""air"" in it -- the author kept saying the same thing over & over, trying to create excitement, trying to stretch the manuscript. I became annoyed, but I finished the book because I wanted to know what they found in Beethoven's hair. The results were mildly interesting, but certainly not worth hours of my time. My boyfriend summed it up perfectly: ""It should have been a magazine article, not a book."""
3,A good idea but bad execution,"Many of the previous reviewers were correct in saying that this made a better magazine article than a book. I don't know what was so captivating about this book. There were several times when I did some serious skimming.At times, this book reads like a spotty history of European Jewry, a mini-biography Beethoven, and a history of forensic science. It was as if Martin discovered the process of historical research in this book, and then failed to cut the wheat from the chaff. At one point he spends several pages discussing the exodus of Jews from Denmark. It's interesting reading, but certainly not relevant for a book about Beethoven. Regardless, if you're a fan of Beethoven, this makes good reading, but it's not the paramount achievement in the literature."
3,Interesting read,"I liked the book. Yes, it is a bit lengthy and drawn out - but the author does a good job of presenting the material and making it interesting. I would have liked more information about Beethoven himself and less about the hair's travels, though. I couldn't keep track of all the characters and times and places - that kind of stuff puts me to sleep. I think a good sequel to this book would be about how scientists clone Beethoven using the DNA found in his hair strands."
1,Boring book,"Who doesn't love Beethoven? Who doesn't love Beethoven facts?But Beethoven's Hair is a bore.This book is analogous to submitting your theme for your 30-page semester paper and once you began to write you found your subject was worth about 3 pages.Pumped up, poorly organized, wildly disarrayed, who can call this ""masterful"" except the author's mother?"
4,There stands a great man!,"I always thought of Mozart as the most prolific classical composer of all time. But I have changed my mind after I read this book on Van Beethoven. Before I read this book, Beethoven was just another classical musician who wouldn't dare to compare himself to the great Mozart. But when I found out the hundreds miseries(maladies and deafness) Beethoven went through while was writing his pieces, I was amazed.How can one write a piece like the 9th symphony while being deaf. To me, this is just inconceivable. After reading this book, I become not to see Mozart no more as the greatest but as great since the great Beethoven stands next to him.If you are a friend of the Classicals and you haven't read this book, get to it as fast as you can."
1,not worth 5 dollars,"well i assumed that this book would be crap seeing as it is about beethoven's hair. however i read it in hopes that it would be about beethoven. it is not, it is about the nazis. honestly you read the book and it starts off with beethoven, then a name gets dropped of some famous composer or related family memeber. And in a matter of sentences you go from the death of beethoven to the rescuing of jews from denmark? what? yeah. its basically a 288 page ramble. However within those pages there are a few good quotes and some worthy information. Like someone said ""who doesn't love beethoven,"" we all love his music and have a strong appreciation for him, but if i were you, i'd save your five dollars and buy some ice cream or something."
3,Book doesn't live up to promise of its title,"I wanted to like this book, but found it too academic in style, and with not many new ideas. One redeeeming point was an excellent bibliography.I found it a bit self-serving to have testimonials from other Harvard Business School faculty on the back cover of the book. Could these persons really offer an impartial assessment of a book written by a colleague they see almost every day?"
3,Good book,"This is an average book that details useful guidelines for brainstorming. However, it lacks the depth many of the other books on brainstorming that are on the market. A good book for the novice."
4,Works well in a toddler seat,"We have the cradler in our Evenflo Triumph Advance car seat and our baby is 11 months old. Before buying this product, we tried the U-shaped pillow that goes around the baby's neck. She pulled it off every time. Then we tried adding a little strap to secure it around her head...that just got her more aggravated! Anyway, she seems to like the cradler MUCH better. We removed the little head support pillow that comes with the car seat because it's unnecessary with the cradler. The cradler does a good job of preventing the head side-slump which is the more common scenario than the forward-slump at least in our baby's case. It's easy to attach, detach and adjust for head size. We're happy with this product."
2,doesn't work,I bought it to stop my sons head from flopping to the side when he fell asleep in the carseat but it just forced his head forward so that instead of flopping sideways it flopped forward.
2,Does not work,"This product does not work at all for keeping baby's head from slumping forward when installed by the instructions. However, for my nine month old, if you attach the velcro together under the car seat straps on baby's chest, then the cushions somewhat cradle his chin and keep his head leaning to the side as long as you are not stopping and starting the car. In other words, it halfway works installed underneath the chin instead of behind the head and only if you are just coasting down the highway."
1,Pushed head forward when sleeping,"We bought this product when my 6-month-old son moved up to a convertible car seat from his infant car seat. Because the car seat is more upright, his head was dropping forward when he fell asleep in the car. We installed the product as shown, but the first time he fell asleep, his head was pushed so far forward he snored loudly and then started wheezing. I pulled over, woke him up, and removed the pillows. We threw them away after one use. We got cushioned strap covers intead, and they seem to work better because nothing goes behind his head."
2,Will Work for Certain Car Seats,DO NOT purchase this item if your child has a Britax Boulevard car seat (Britax Boulevard Click and Safe Convertible Car Seat - Cowmooflage). The SIP headrest doesn't provide enough room for the neck support pillow. I put it on my daughter and she couldn't even move her head! Needless to say it won't work for that particular car seat! I am sure that it would work wonderfully with the Britax Marathon (Britax Marathon Convertible Car Seat Granite) which is the car seat we have in another car.
2,"Alright, a little awkward","Not sure if its just my daughter, but she isn't a big fan of this. she tries to yank it away from her and she just looks more uncomfortable with it supporting here. I bet it would better for a younger child, she's 14 month's old."
2,Cradler,I returned the product because I felt it was too small for my infant. It looked unconfortable and he wasn't happy with the restrait.
4,good product,"Item as described, shipped properly and in a timely manner. Although, my daughter's head still flops forward a little when she's asleep even with this attached. Thanks."
2,Not comfortable,"This product seems to fall down easily and is not comfortable for my kids. In fact, both children have tried it and can't make it work."
4,Excellent head support for small infants,"I used this head cradler for my son from birth until 8 weeks old. It was a wonderful product for the carseat, swing, or any other seat we put him in.However, once he started getting bigger I needed to expand the pads a bit. The two pads are connected by velcro behind the babies head. Unfortunately, the ""prickly"" side of the velcro faces towards the babies head. Therefore, when it is expanded, some of the prickles are uncovered. My son hated the feel against the back of his head, and we had to discontinue using the product."
2,design flaw,I bought these when my son was a month old to keep his head straight while in the car seat to help with an issue with his neck muscles. It worked until his head grew large enough that we had to spread the Velcro. When we did that he started getting an irritation on the back of his head. I saved them for when he is older. he is now 8 month old and I can not find the proper configuration for them to be comfortable.
1,Useless and Bad Customer Service,"I thought product would support head from falling forward while the baby slept. IT DOES NOT! All car seats support head on each side so I did not need item for that reason. Not only does it not support the head, it increases the possibility of the head falling forward.I contacted the seller to return product and was told I would have to pay a variety of fees to return the product. I replied back that it was not fair that I had to pay fees if the product is not working as advertised and the seller wrote back that if I have a problem I should call the manufacturer. This is the worst customer service I have experienced. If a product is not working as advertised, the seller provides the refund. I have never been told to contact manufacturer if I am not satisfied."
3,"Not for newborn, maybe later","I tried to use this to support my newborns head but was too bulky and awkward. Her head flopped forward. It may work better when she is a few months old, as I will try it again then. The quality is good and it washes easily."
3,It OK...,"I haven't had a whole lot of luck with it, but I think it's just my situation. Give it a try."
3,Yes and no,"We recently bought this to use on our 6 hour drive with our 2 year old. At first he resisted it, then I installed it after he was fast asleep. For the most part it provided some support for his head. It did not prevent him from flopping forward, but my son rested his head sideways on it and used it kind of like a pillow. So I guess it served some purpose, and was better than not having anything. I think it may be more useful with younger kids. All in all, not bad for the price you pay and other alternatives out there."
3,not working right now,I bought this for my 4.5 month old daughter but it is not working as well as I had hoped. She looks uncomfortable and have found her head slumped over twice. I think it will work great as she gets older but not right now. My little girl in the 60th percentile in length so it might depend on the size of the child.
4,These do the trick,"I just use these to support my toddlers head if she falls asleep in the car seat. I kind of just slip them in on either side of head and they usually stay there on own. I must admit that I don't have them on all the time because it seems that they would make her hot. Anyway, they are cute and light weight and soft and do keep her head from flopping over to one side, although it still can flop forward."
5,Really Helped Freshen the Carpet Up,"I have 8 year old builder grade carpet throughout my house that has seen better days. Most of it is fairly matted down and is hard to vacuum everything up as a result.I used this in our living room as instructed; vacuuming the area first, tossing this around, waiting and then vacuuming again. A large amount of stuff came out the second time but the main thing I noticed was that the room has smelled better since then. I guess there were some lingering odors in the carpet and this has done a great job of removing them.Recommended."
1,Not for me!,"""Felt"" the product in my nasal passages and mouth from the very first moment after opening the bag. Used it on a small area of carpet, gave okay results with an Oreck vacuum cleaner. Now feeling itchy on exposed areas of skin. Have windows wide open and am disposing of remaining product immediately, replacing the cleaner bag, and am showering and shampooing right after. I'm generally not prone to reactions, but definitely feeling that this product is not for me."
5,Really works!,"I love this product, it works very well and it smells great. I would recommend it to anyone. Be sure to let it dry completely before vacuuming it up."
5,Awesome,"I love this product. It leaves a very pleasant, light and fresh fragrance. Very easy to use."
3,So-so...,"I can't say that it really cleared my carpet. And also I can't say that the carpet didn't change.The dark gray spots on my white carpet turned to the light gray, but not disappeared at all."
5,Dyson Zorb is the Best!,This product works as well as renting a carpet cleaning machine from the local grocer. I was amazed at the fresh scent and ability to take out top dirt stains!
4,next best thing to steam cleaning.,"This product has a clean fresh scent. It does an excellant job of cleaning surface dirt from the carpet. I am not sure how well it would work if you were not using it with a dyson. You do have to work it into the carpet fibers, allow it to dry then sweep up the dry particles. It it like tiny little moist sponges. I use it between more through steam cleaning."
4,Used this before.,Some of this came with my Dyson vacuum cleaner. I tried it on the stairs and was pleased with it. So I ordered some more to try in high-traffic areas.
3,Not sure if it's worth the cost,"This product leaves a nice smell, but not sure if it's worth the cost. I'm not sure it cleans as well as it states or if its just masking it with a scent."
1,"Smells awful, did not clean carpet","So I was very excited to try this product, but my excitement faded as soon as I opened the bag. The smell was so strong it made my eyes water, nose run and throat hurt. Not only is it a strong smell, it is a BAD smell...chemically and sour. I held my breath and tried it in a small area. It took about an hour to dry and after vacuuming I saw no change in the carpet. The smell took days to fade, had to open window in 95+ degree weather. Could not use the rest of bag. Might work on significant stains but did nothing for my high traffic light stains. Someone with less sensitve nose/eyes might not be bothered by smell. Wanted to like this but I was disappointed!"
2,SIMPLY DIDN'T WORK,I tried this product and it is like spreading wet sawdust on your carpet. It didn't seem to remove any dirt whatsoever. My carpet looks the exact same as it did before I used the product. It has a nice smell and that's about it. I wouldn't recommend this product and I will stick with my carpet cleaner from now on.
2,Disappointed it didn't work,I had high hopes that this product would remove dirt and stains but it did nothing. I love my Dyson Animal vacuum but will continue to have my carpets professionally cleaned.
1,does not work,Carpet smelled nice but this stuff does not clean the carpet. It promised to clean even old stains. I wouldn't even clean a fresh dirty area.
2,not worth it,"i am not impressed with this product at all. although i love my dyson vac, this carpet maintenance powder must only work on new hardly soiled carpet as my old carpet is just as dirty as before"
4,The best smelling carpet cleaner.,"It took me about 1hour (including the wait time of 30 minutes) and my one-year-old carpet was absolutely refreshed. I pretreated and spot cleaned all the stains (left by a child who everything and everywhere in the house). This Zorb powder left my house smelling so fresh, the carpet looks like brand new. I didn't like washing the Zorb brush afterwards and cleaning my Dyson Animal (the reason I gave 4 stars). I'm planning on buying more of this powder and use it at least monthly to keep the carpet in my house looking like new."
1,Not impressed...,"I got a free bag of Zorb with my Dyson. Tried it out and I could not be less impressed. I used it on the high-traffic areas of my carpet, which showed a hint of discoloration due to the dirt tracked in. Nothing particularly difficult to remove - it's just where most of the dirt is deposited and it starts to show after a few months.Zorbed the carpet, worked it in, let it dry, vacuumed it up, and no visible change. I would have been back at the store asking for a refund if I'd actually paid for it.Hit the same are with Resolve powder and the carpet looks brand new again.Could have been me, could have been the Zorb bag I got, could have been my carpet, but Zorb didn't work for me, and I'm not inclined to try it again."
2,It does nothing to my berber carpet...,"It does nothing that I can see except leave a pleasant scent. I scrub it in with a firm bristle brush, wait 30 minutes, vacuum with my Dyson, and my carpet still looks the same. It is only 2 years old so it isn't an old carpet. It might work on carpets that are more of a ""pile"" but not berber. I gave 2 stars just for scent alone."
2,This just didn't work.,"It smelled nice. It was like sawdust but spongy and moist. It smelled nice.Other than that, it did nothing."
1,Dyson Zorb Carpet Powder,"It won't clean any spots but it will freshen the the smell, if any, and awaken the nap...no pun intended. It refreshes and renews with relatively little effort. We have 2 dogs and they have had no adverse reactions. So, in between carpet cleanings this product will give your carpet a pick-me-up."
2,boring,not my type of story so I found it very boring. it was under the category of Westerns but it wasn't. like any western I' 've ever read.
4,Good read,I would not consider this any where near a western. But still an interesting book. A little dry at times.
1,As I See It,How this book got registered by Amazon as a Western is a mystery. It has an European setting. I did not finish the book.
1,Bunker Bean,Read about a quarter of it and then got rid of it. Not much of a story. Do not recomend it for any one.
2,Frederick II : A Medieval Emperor,"In spite of his erudite mastery of a great diversity of detail in this study, Mr. Abulafia succumbs to the tendency of certain historians today to be first and foremost, a ""revisionist"". At times an iconoclastic need to ""remake"" his subject in a new image overshadows his otherwise constructive insights; leading one to wonder if perhaps the presentation of conclusions that overturn previously-held conceptions has not become too much of an end in itself, and certainly a way to establish one's reputation in the historical profession!"
5,Great Read,"This is an easy read that stays on track and manages to convey what the period must have been like. Though David dispels some of the mystique, he also brings home the life of Frederick II. I have read this several times now and enjoy it every time."
4,A good solid basis in the fundamentals of management,"As a student with 13 years of management experience I found this book to be outstanding. The case studies in particular were well founded, coming from real life situations. The idea of using one startup company and taking them from ground zero to international business was both enticing and useful."
4,Hmmmmmm,"Something very interesting is going on here, and I have the distinct feeling this band's first full length is going to be an absolute stunner. The pieces are all here, just need to channel that into 12-15 songs and let us have it."
1,You don't have to deny hate?,If you buy into this book all the victims would or could have been perpetrators. Doesn't happen that way in real life. There were those who helped or rescued others and those who were extremists and a lot of others in between--though they also had choices. Apologists for genocide and those who point to the few victims that were as horrific as the perpetrators are lost in fantasy.
1,Those darn Jews,"Those darn Jews! The germans kill about 6 million of them, including 1 million under the age of 12 years old and out of about 250,000 survivors, HUNDREDS of them forget everything they knew about sportsmanlike behavior. And those terrible Russians! The germans kill about 20 or maybe 30 or maybe 40 million of them and they're even more rude than the jews. I guess Mr. sack forgot who started the war."
5,"funny, scary, odd, and funny",If you like rock and roll. If you can read. Buy this book! You need it. Michael Ruffino is a stone solid genius. And his sense of the ironic in EVERYTHING is just plain brilliant.
3,Not for opening mason jars: plastic scratches off and gets into food,"I used this to open vacuum-packed mason jars. The plastic couldn't stand up to themetal, and I kept finding small plastic flakes in my food before I realized it wasgetting scratched off of the opener."
2,Jar pop works only on pry up lids,"I suppose the name of the item should have alerted us that this device works only on ""pry up"" type lids. Unfortunately we wanted it to help with screw tops. On arrival, we discovered we don't have a single pry top lid in the house! A mention in the description that it doesn't work on screw lids would have reinforced the name."
3,"Simple in a nice, old-fashioned kind of way",Simple and straightforward. Nice to have for just popping something open instead of using a multipurpose device that is bulky and over-kill for the quick task. Bright color makes it easy to find in a drawer among all the other kitchen gadgets.
5,Best Jar Opener I've Found,My sister gave me one of these jar openers for Christmas. I have to say that it works better than any jar opener that I have ever found. And I have tried a lot of different gadgets for opening jars. But this one is the easiest and most effective one to use that I have yet encountered.
3,Interesting,"This is an interesting album for its time (1981). But its not the best surf album out there by any means, and not worth the ridiculous resale price on Amazon. There are a lot of different sounds, from Link Wray to The Vara-Tones to Laika to Double-Naught Spy Car, even the Sandals. Perhaps a bit too much hipster spy/space sound (and organ or saxophone) for my taste, but clearly a band that set the tone for many groups in the 90's and after."
4,ROX MY SOX,"This toy is pretty stellar. I mean, you can play battleship anytime you want w/o having to ask someone else to play with you. It is awesome for long trips or just something to do if your bored."
3,Poor AI,The computer intelligence is quite poor. For e.g. there have been times when it attempts to locate lets say my battleship (a ship that requires 4 hits) in an area where only a ship that requires 2 or 3 hits can be located. This should not be really. The computer's attempt at locating ships seems to be purely random.
3,Great handheld adaption of board game.,Very fun if you're a battleship fan.. the other two modes and other skill levels is a nice touch. The only complaint I have is that the sound effects rather suck.
3,"Fun to play, yet just a another game.","This game is fun but, it does get boring on long vacation trips. The durability is good, yet I wouldn't say to drop it every where you go. And educational value, well I really don't see any educational value in this game except where to line up your ships."
4,A good gift!,This was a gift to an 8 year-old boy. He seemed to like it and it keeps him occupied. His parents are happy with it.
4,Where are the other Moldovan travelogues?,"As someone who takes a great interest in the former Soviet Republics, I'm always interested in personal travelogues throughout the area. This book didn't disappoint. His perspective is great for a country so rarely visited. And he shows respect and deference to Moldavians and the progress they've been working towards. The pictures are great as are the descriptions of each soccer player."
3,I've read it,"I am headed for Moldova and read this book in trying to learn as much as I can about the country. I am a big fan of humor and travel writings. I liked the book, but I might have enjoyed it more if I knew something about the author- he strikes me more as a stand-up comedian type than a writer, which I think may be the case. Still, it was an amusing read, and it did teach me a bit about The Republic of Moldova. I was say read it for a laugh. I liked it enough to consider reading his book about Ireland."
3,it's ok,This book is alright. Not too many designs inside. Multiple looks of the same idea. A couple basic tips on wreath making. Sometimes I find it skips a step in the directions... I could do with out this one.
3,"Very Cute, But Runs Large","The top itself is very cute and the color is beautiful (I bought the aqua). The style is also unique, which I found very appealing. l am petite, so I ordered a size small. Unfortunately, the top is still very large on me. If it were only slightly big, I would have kept it, because I liked it so much. But sadly there is just no way to make it work. Sure wish they made it in an X-small, or even XX-small.Bottom line - it's a beautiful top, but it runs very big."
2,LOOOOOOng and self-indulgent.,"How much ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""Moby Dick"" can you bear? You'll find out if you buy this album. Tedious."
5,Best Sound Track In The World!!!,"This CD captures Zeppelin at the peak of their career, in myopinion. The album is mysitcally captivating. Since I've Been LovingYou was unfortunately cut from the album, but there are enough othergreat songs to back it up. The No Quarter solo is simply magical. Thenew versions of The Rain Song and Song Remains The Same is stunninglyamazing, even as Page makes his studio songs very hard to arrange forlive performance by using so many tracked guitars. The album is worthevery penny, and if you DO own it, and you haven't seen the movie, iwould suggest you get that too!.."
4,deceptive,"Yes this was remastered but not since 1994, even though this edition (which is made to replicate in minature the original gatefold lp) came out in 2003. While the minature replication is a nice touch it may not warrant the premium price, the 94' release is all you need, sound wise."
5,4 Creative minds working on Stage,"I am sure that contrary to what people below think...Led Zeppelin dont care what other people think of this album. This was a tribute to the creative genius of four of the most influential rock artists to date. Page with the violin bow on the guitar was amazing, and plant imitating the guitar with his voice left me awestruck. No-one can do that anymore. Boneham in Moby Dick was as energetic as ever while John Paul-Jones kept the backbone straight while providing creative outburts that require careful listining. Buy this if you want a small insight into the workings of the groups minds."
4,The cd is good even though it is a liitle sloppy,"If you are a Zeppelin fan, like i am, you would like the cd. It has some of the classics of them. Even though dazed and confused is twenty-six minutes long, it can keep you entertained. stairway to heaven was ok, it wasnt the best that they did it. All the other songs were either awsome or boring."
5,Not for weenies,"Amazing amazing guitar, vocal, and drum works. This is the best in Zeppelin I have seen or heard so far. Its heavier, and more innovative than their studio albums. If you call chaotic guitar and screaming Page vocals noisy, please put on ear plugs and re-listen. I am surprised about all the controversy on how this relatively was not a good concert. Has the world gone crazy?????????"
3,Where is Black Dog and Since I've Been Loving you,"When i saw that movie, those were the 2 songs that made me die hard led zeppelin fans. Page's Improv is outstanding and one of a kind to a level beyond anything i've seen from any other band exept maybe Clapton and Hendrix. And those two songs, The intro to BlackDog, and all of Since i've been loving you is so unbelievable good, yet they didn't include it. i can't believe it. All songs are good, but they are pretty long."
2,The Song Remains The Same,"Led Zeppelin's initial popularity was based as much on the band's concerts as its albums, and The Song Remains the Same, released in conjunction with the pseudodocumentary film of the same name, reproduces the very things that made Zeppelin concerts legendary: lengthy solos, intertwining interplay between Page and Plant, and ridiculously long songs (""Dazed and Confused"" is nearly an entire half hour)."
5,SIMPLY GREAT,"THIS IS NOT ONLY A GREAT ALBUM,BUT A MUST FOR ANY MUSICIAN WHO WANTS TO LEARN HOW TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THERE INSTUMENT.IF YOU PAYED ATTETION YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN,IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THEN YOU NEVER WILL."
2,Confused And Dazed,"Unfortunately, this great band has only this album to represent their live work. This is largely tedious and self-indulgent. Hopefully, Swan Song has some better live tapes in their vaults. If not, the great concerts that Led Zeppelin put on will be consigned only to our memories."
4,Led Zeppelin-'The Song Remains The Same'(Atlantic)Movie Sdtk,"This must of been the first Zeppelin album I ever bought.I remember since they were rarely if EVER on American TV,at least when they were still together,if you wanted to see their performance,you either had to attend their concert or go see the movie.Which,of course this is the soundtrack to.Very well done.May be one of THE better 'live' albums of the '70's.Best tracks here to have kept many parties going back in the day(I'm sure)are ""Celebration Day"",the 27-minute ""Daze And Confused"",""No Quarter"",""Stairway To Heaven"" and ""Moby Dick"".Great to kill a Saturday with.Recommended."
4,Very satisfied with CD Set,"I bought this for two reasons: compared to the DVD, this CD has a more complete version of Whole Lotta Love, and Celebration Day is intact. This CD set arrived very quickly and in great condition, so I'm very satisfied with this transaction. I would buy from this seller again."
4,A classic Live album,"The sound is not the best I have heard, but great live rock concert from Led Zeppelin, incredible version of ""Rock'n'Roll"", ""The Rain Song"", ""No Quarter"" and of course ""Stairway to heaven"". This is a classic live album in the Rock'n'Roll history."
3,An enigmatic release from Led Zeppelin,"I'm often amazed that this was ever released; it truly must be considered one of the sloppiest live albums of all time. But, despite being raggedy to the point of no return, there is still something here: ""a who-gives-a-damn-hey-we're-ROCK-STARS!"" swagger that only Zep could have pulled off."
3,appreciate it,"We are not a huge ZEP fan, our fave band is Deep Purple. Though I appreciated this live album. ZEP wasn't originally hard rock band, they were blues rock band. Deep Purple plays more louder! This album was acceptable"
1,I remember laughter...............then falling asleep!,"What all the 5 star reviewers are saying is that they love Led Zeppelin. I can understand their devotion to the super group, however, their devotion is clouding their senses. The problem with this live album is the performances the band selected. Why choose the final 3 dates in NYC? The band is clearly high, tired, incoherant, drunk and fried beyond comprehension. With so many outstanding shows under their belt, why choose these dates when the band resembles Night Of the Living Dead? If your answer is MONEY, well then you go to the bonus round! It was the 70's and every band had a live album to separate their fans from their hard earned pay. If you want to hear the mighty Zep in flight please purchase the BBC Sessions."
3,Zep Live,"Led Zeppelin set all kinds of box office records during their hey day in the early to mid 70's. It was only natural that they would release a live album. The Song Remains The Same is not only a live set, but the soundtrack to a concert film of the same name. The film works better than the album (although the band could have dispensed with the weird non-concert scenes) because a major part of what made Zeppelin a major draw was the overall stage show with the lights, pyrotechnics and the like. The songs drag on a bit to long. ""Dazed & Confused"" is a tremendous song and Jimmy Page does some great stuff with the crossbow on it, but does it need to stretch out over 25 minutes long. Overall, The Song Remains The Same isn't a bad live set, it just could have been better."
3,Self indulgent band,"DEEP PURPLE is much better and harder,....this band is also good but not have so harder sound like DP."
3,Not The Best,"My opinion of their best song on the album is 'Dazed and confused'. The 25 minute plus song which includes the violin bow and has 4 To 5 lightspeed solos, but has been chopped up due to the length. The same is done to 'Whole lotta love'. The rest of the songs are about the length of the studio albums except for the previously stated songs and 'No quarter' which has a good solo added to it. I wouldn't recommend this album based on the missing, and chopped songs. If you own the Dvd you could get software to extract the audio. However, I highly recommend ""How The West Was Won"". This album lacks their full list of songs that were performed at Madison Square Garden in 1973. The missing songs are 'Black dog', 'Since i've been loving you', 'Misty mountain hop', 'Heartbreaker', and 'The ocean'. The songs 'Misty mountain hop' and 'The ocean' can be viewed on the Led Zeppelin Dvd."
2,The Song Remains the Same..............,"Unfortenatly, the song does remain the same, for almost half an hour on Dazed and Confused and Whole Lotta Love. It's shocking that a band as good as Led Zeppelin would release such as disapointing product for their first live album. The Song Remains the Same is a double album only containing nine tracks. The album starts off great with the shorter songs like Rock and Roll, then after about 4 or 5 songs it breaks into the more long winded tracks like Dazed and Confused and Whole Lotta Love. Zeppelin is one of the greatest rock bands ever, but that can't save the Song Remains the Same from being a total bore. I love roughly half the hate, but I despise the other half, hence the two star rating. For die hards only, I'd advise you to purchase all of Zeppelin's studio albums, but avoid this like the plague."
2,This is bloated crappola.,"Unfortunately I feel the same way about this album as I do the movie. Except for ""Celebration Day,"" (which rocks) the rest of this album kind of, well, sucks. ""The Song Reamins the Same"" and ""The Rain Song"" are passable, but the rest... ugh. ""Moby Dick"" goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on... and fails to impress. ""Dazed and Confused"" (a song I never liked) is almost half an hour and it's sooo boring. ""Stairway to Heaven"" is weak. ""Whole Lotta Love"" is played differently, in a funky, dance-like manner, but the melody thing is stupid. Why did they do that all the time? On ""No Quarter"" John-Paul Jones plays about three notes in 5 minutes on the keyboard, it's soo slow. ""Rock N' Roll"" is performed so lethargic, it sounds like a Zeppelin cover band (Kingdom Come?) rather than the real thing. And I know they were better live than this record shows."
2,not so good,"I'm as big a fan of Zep as most reviewers but I have always been terribly disappointed with this release. All the live Led Zeppelin I've ever heard really does not compare with the studio albums. They were just plain sloppy and couldn't capture their greatness in a concert setting. If you need some live Zeppelin check out the newer, better sounding, and way better performances on How the West Was Won. For casual fans I'd suggest sticking with the studio offerings."
2,Disappointing live performance from a dismal film,"This was Led Zeppelin's only official (non-bootleg) ""live"" release for many years. The performance captured here was lackluster and uninspired, and the concert film for which it is the soundtrack, with its extended ""fantasy"" sequences, is downright embarrassing to watch. Getting through ""Dazed and Confused,"" at 25 minutes in length, is a true ordeal for the listener. Still, there are a few high points, like ""Celebration Day"" and the oldies medley at the end. If you're looking for a recording that captures the true spirit of Zeppelin in concert, opt for the superior ""BBC Sessions."""
5,Dare I say second only to Album #2?,"I love this album. While I might not have it directly on any of my listamania lists or other, it is still a classic in my heart. Every song on the double album is reflected of what Led Zeppelin meant to rockers and music fans in general- energy, peacefulness, a strange quality that was all there own can be seen in songs like No Quarter, Moby Dick, the 26 minute epic (that sounds like 2 hours on drugs) Dazed and Confused and of course Stairway to Heaven and the title track itself.Bottom line, Bonham, Jones, Plant and Page have an album here that is beautiful. ...Just remember while letting this flow in through the out ear that concerts can be as good, if not better, than the studio versions."
4,Sick No Quarter,"If you're looking for 21st century soundboard Quality and note for note song tracks, this is not your cd. But Jimmy's jams along with Bonzo's thundering percussion are unreal.Plant's voice sounds better live than in the studio I believe. I've probably made over a 100 mixed mp3 cd's and Song Remains the Same -> Rain Song or No Quarter from this album are probably on over half of them. A must have live cd"
2,Dont Waste Your Money,This is not a good remaster. The original sounds just as good if not better. This version is duller. I am a remaster junky. Unless you want a collectors item....dont waste your time if your looking for a better sounding cd.
3,"Ragged, but right!","I've heard many recordings of the 1973 tour and this album is a good representation of how they sounded on stage at the time. How The West Was Won captures a cleaner Zeppelin and a superior performance, but there's a swagger to these NYC shows that is undeniable. The Houses Of The Holy material is more exploratory and satisfying here than the studio versions as well.Like many other reviewers, I'd like to see an updated version with SIBLY, Misty Mountain Hop and the rest. Three and half stars."
5,Great stuff from Germany,"I have been drinking this coffee since 1990. Needless to say, that I grew up in Germany. I ask my parents to send this coffee to me for my birthday and Christmas. It is better than any Gevalia coffee I have ever had. If you like Gevalia Coffee you will like Prodomo even better. Dallmyre just know how to roast the beans better than anyone. If you want better you must go for Kona Coffee."
4,"High-Tempo, up-beat Racer","This game has THE MOST impressive frame rate I have ever seen. If you are a Star Wars Fanatic (like me), buy this game, hands down. END"
4,Awsome action with very responsive controls,"I have just returned from the Star Wars Celebration in Denver, Colorado and I had the chance to play the pod racer game. The sense of speed was thrilling and after a few false starts I was able to take 5th place in a race. Can't wait to own this one. It's lots of fun. END"
3,"Good, but not the best","Now please read this if you have not bought this game!Ibought this game for what I thought was a low price.... Ithought I would have fun, because I played it at a computer store and won. Let me tell, you- this game was fun at the time I bought it, but I got a little bored with it. It got less fun even as I got Sebulba and Quadinaros. And if you do buy this, remember to only play the Boonta Training Course once- it is a total bore later on. This game should be priced at about 7 dollars. Not LucasArt's best work."
2,Bad Controling,"I played this game a couple times and I think it's not worthbuying for [the price]! The controling is horrible! Although the graphics are great, I think LucasArts could have worked harder on this game!"
5,Great family fun!,Finally a great game to play at home over my network. My daughters (11 & 13) absolutely love this game. No blood/guts. Just good clean fun.
4,Not A Racing Fan,I bought this game not knowing what to expect because I'm not really a racing fan. But after playing the game I enjoyed myself. this game is good to get even if your not a fan of racing games and just want to waste some time. But I recommend buying a controller for this game it's makes it allot better.
4,One Top Racing Game...,"The moment I popped this game into my computer, was the beginning of many unless nights of no sleep. Not only did I find myself hooked to the game, my room mate and friends come around to play this fantastic racing game on my computer. Pod racers come and go as we play the game further and find some unique pod racer to our liking, each one handles differently and has it's advantages and disadvanatages. The only two problems I found with this game is that it's highly boring to play without a cool joystick, and that it's incredibly difficult to win races after this certain point. It turns from moderately hard to impossible to beat. The hardest thing to do. however, was kicking my room mate off the game and off my computer."
4,this game is fun but the price is to high at this time,"the game is great it has wonderful graphics, superb sound, excellent game play, and much much more but, $47.00 dollars for a game like this is a bit pricy."
3,Great Graphics and Gameplay,"Star Wars RACER features excellent graphics. You get your choice of pods and their corresponding character. During the race, the graphics are very smooth and the controls are very easy to master. During the first few races, expect to break lap records in finish first. In the harder levels, expect nose-to-nose finishes. The only drawback is that the game is pretty much the same from start to finish. This is a must have and still today, it will show off your graphics card!"
3,Gift,I bought this as a gift and didn't know it would only work with older windows applications. Finally found and old laptop that it would install on and my grandson is enjoying the game.
3,If you liked Land of Broken Hearts then buy this album.,"The album sounded exactly like Land of Broken Hearts. Like all Royal Hunt albums it has some great classical compositions, but this album still lacks the sinister DC Cooper."
2,Just an average book,"This book seemed similar to Melinda Johnston's other quilling book. It had basically all large projects in it - which is not very helpful for the modern quillist. For someone who wants to quill more modern pieces and cards, I would recommend Mickey Baskett's book."
4,Nice patterns,"Just received this book and am enjoying looking thru it. While I think it's a bit pricey, it's certainly a good buy if you can find a nice used copy. The pattern for the teddy bear card is adorable."
5,Works exactly as described.,This tester came exactly as decribed and had all the adapters I needed for my specific needs. It is a good price for a digital compression tester.
2,Poor analysis,"This book is intended to portray the US infantry divisions fighting in north west Europe 1944-5. Had the author written only about the US divisions, the book might have been better. However, he makes several comparisons with the German units and also occasionally with British units. These sections display poor analysis, exhibit sweeping but unsubstantiated statements and faulty use of sources. Had he refrained from this and dealt only with the US divisions, the book might have deserved a higher rating, but these errors display poor scholarship."
3,Solid history but a disappointing finish,"Peter Mansoor treaded some ground that many have ignored or bypassed, and he successfully highlighted US Army Operations not portrayed by Hollywood hits like ""Patton"" and ""Saving Private Ryan."" He painted a fascinating picture about just how good the greatest generation was at adapting to harsh environments, a determined foe, and an impersonal military system. The book's greatest weakness is that it failed to exploit a provacative angle: that of GI military effectiveness. The definition offered in the introduction really sounds more like military efficiency, and Mansoor convincingly stated his case that the US Army was certainly more efficient than the tired out German Army. And that is the point. The GIs took on the already exhausted if not still tactically potent Wehrmacht. Although there were some tense moments, the end result was assured, it was only a matter of time. The Americans knew their business, and they exploited every advantage over the Germans."
5,Innovative and Fresh !,"Another creative and rockin' album by the former Replacements drummer. Gives yet further proof, that although he was not the dominant voice in the Replacements, when it comes to the former Mats, he has turned out the better albums."
4,FRESH SCENT,"I am one of those individuals who cannot wear any scent I may be drawn to because most give me headaches. Of the few I can wear this is one of my favorite! It is light and subtle, not powdery, and not overbearing so that someone needs to be right next to you to beaware of your fragrance. There is nothing worse, in my opinion, than to be overwhelmed by someone else's scent. I even wear this when I'm staying-in because I enjoy the fragrance that much. My only criticism and reason for 4*'s vs. 5, is that the scent does not stick around long enough. I find myself reapplying once (at least) a day. They need a body oil or lotion. I haven't tried the gel yet but maybe layering it with that would help it last."
1,Counterfeit!!!!!,"I bought this as a Mother's Day gift for my mother. She just now (Sept 2nd) informed me that this product was a counterfeit. She said it started to lose it's fragrance after a month. She wrote to Ralph Lauren and was told to return it. Of course, since it was a gift, she couldn't do that. She then talked to a local merchant that carried the product and was told to bring it in. It was at that local merchant that she was informed the product was a counterfeit. So, I'm out the money and she's out the gift. She was also informed that counterfeit fragrances can have dangerous chemicals. I would not have expected this from Amazon. Guess no place is safe to shop these days."
1,Very disappointed,"I ordered this product online because apparently this perfume isn't available anymore in stores.I never received my item because it was delivered to someone else in a completely different state. I don't know if the mailing label got put on the wrong box or what happened but I never received anything. When I notified the seller I never got any response. I emailed 3 times and still nothing.I finally got an email from Amazon. Not the seller but Amazon saying that my account had been credited the full amount. Fine, but I really would have appreciated the seller contacting me and apologizing for the mistake or just letting me know what was happening. I didn't even want a refund. I just wanted what I purchased.Like I said, I'm very disappointed and will never order from Cosmetics Plaza again."
1,AVOID FAKE,"I spent 80.00 on this, its a complete fake, My mom and myself have worn this for years. It did not smell the same, also the packaging was not right and the perfume liquid has floaties and particles in it. I tried to return for refund, but its not allowing me to. Really unhappy as its a huge waste of 80.00. Would give 0 stars if I could."
3,mini special,"I love my mini perfume, but when I got it I found out it was a sample which doesn't last as much as the regular size Ralph Lauren. I think you should have mentioned that in the item description."
4,Wonderful,"Love Ralph Lauren Blue! I had a small sample of it some time ago and was looking forward to owning it. My only mistake was in purchasing the EDT version. I think the parfum would have been a better choice for me, as it is longer lasting. When I purchase again, that will be my choice. Blue is one of my all time favorites."
5,Best perfume in a long time!,"I absolutely love this stuff! It smells great on anyone and can be worn anytime, whether on a date, to the movies, grocery store, or even just taking your kids to the park. It's good for young and old and has a distinct smell on everyone who wears it. I love it and it has become my favorite perfume ever! I get lots of compliments from my family and boyfriend on the scent."
1,Undecided,"I ordered two bottles of Ralph Lauren Blue and I kept one and my daughter has the other, we both agree that it does not compare to our first purchases of the same fragrance from a retail store. The smell does not compare. These two bottles I ordered from Amazon smell very weak and the fragrance is only there a very short time. We're both disappointed.We also don't understand why the bottles came unboxed."
5,A classic!,"RLB is my #1 perfume, it's classic and not over powering. I've never gotten so many compliments on a perfume before."
1,ralph lauren blue,it's not the real perfume. I didn't like it. maybe it as been exposed to the sun for too long.
5,Great Item!! Love Ralph Lauren Blue for women.,Great Item!! Love Ralph Lauren Blue for women. This is the real Eau De Toilette Spray. You can't beat the price.
4,I love this product,"I bought this product from three different people; I'm so upset that I can't find it at the stores anymore; the three vendors were prompt and I will buy from them again, when the opportunity presents."
2,paid tooo much,The price I paid was much too high. I got caught up in the fact I couldn't find it in the department store. Totally over paid. Recently found it at Kohls for 1/2 the price.
4,"""Blue""",Arrived super fast! Good product. A bit hard to use though because of the size of the odd shaped bottle.
4,One of Abel's Best,"Although I can't quite give this one five stars, as it flounders ever-so-slightly at the end, this one really nails it in terms of capturing the essence of a young woman in search of that elusive thing called ""experience"". I was drawn in to the journey of the main character in a way that is difficult to put into words. Honestly,Abel has managed to construct an emotional experience that can't be expressed by a text review. Please do get this and experience it."
2,Stay Perdida,"The protagonist is the epitome of the ""oblivious gringa"" that travelshalf a world away (in her mind) to Mexico (3rd world countrynonetheless) to ""find herself"". Wearing her half-mexican mask andclaiming to be better than her ex, just cuz she wants to get to knowthe people and the culture, I find this character not only annoying,but completely undeserving of any sympathy. The whole story is filledwith self-indulgent and forgettable events, only to come back to theUS feeling bad about her little escapade. The only satisfying featureof this comic is that is short. I hope she stays lost."
5,"Great Flatware, Reasonable Price","I have had this flatware (service for 8) for about 8 years. I just wanted some nice, heavy, everyday flatware, and it has served me well. The forks are a nice size, and heavy (18/10), and they have stood up to years of dishwasher with hard water, and are now beginning to show some signs of aging. I am considering buying this set to complement my original set, probably continue to use the old stuff, but would use this for large company gatherings."
1,BORING!,"I picked up this book at the local bookstore thinking that I would try something different. The synopsis intrigued me. However, I could only get halfway through the book and never finished it. I guess I'm not into the California/New Age mentality."
5,"""Very fun game!""",This is a very fun game! Just like the original jenga but even more fun. This is fun because you don't know what you will move next until you roll the dice. Will you move blue or yellow or red?! It is a very fun rainy day game or when you are at a party because tons of people can play and all ages love it. If you like the regular way of playing better than don't use the dice! This game is pretty educational because you have to think where you're going to move the next piece and what will the reaction be. The only problem with this game is that it can get dusty or break or the pieces could get lost. Other than that this game is very fun. It's a great gift for the holidays or someone's birthday.
4,History of the English Language,"This is one of a number of good books on the history of the English language written by users of language (editors, columnists, etc.) rather than by professional linguists. Though the books necessarily overlap each other, each such book (I have a number of them) offers examples none of the others offer. I've never seen an obviously bad one (my formal training, though, is limited to a one-semester course based on Albert Baugh's scholarly history) and I recommend this one."
2,Dissapointed!!! No support for CD-Rs,"I guess this is a Philips thing, but in spite of the proclaimed CD-Rewritable compatibility, this boombox does NOT play CD-Rs. I am returning it... I apologize if my other review lead you into buying it, unless you don't mind this ""detail""."
2,Uh oh!,"This was a nice little CD player at first. Fairly inexpensive, small, and kind of cute. I've only had it since September. I haven't dropped it or anything but the CD part stopped working altogether. Supposedly I can't return it anymore so, I don't know what to do with it. I'm really upset, Phillips is usually a VERY good brand."
2,Even one who loves needlework books doesn't like this,"I own hundreds of needlework books on just about every kind using a threaded needle. I love to read of needlework history, especially about samplers, and stitching in England. I don't do needlepoint but have stitched several projects using needlepoint designs. This book, however, does not lend itself to practical use. There are flowery, artistic portraits in the long introduction. Then the author discusses choosing patterns, stitch techniques and offers one alphabet. Then he launches into the 4 seasons with a number of designs each. They are all simple-minded and 2-dimensional. The most stunning one is the owl on the cover and that one is not as is pictured inside: the graph has the owl with a lame border, not the more interesting flurry of flowering vines on the cover. The colors are insipid pastels. I'd pass."
3,Lord of the Rings,"After seeing the movie ""Lord of the Rings"" I wanted to find out more aboout the man who had authored such an ambitious work of fiction. I remember for years hearing that the writing and the story were so spectacular that it was impossible to translate to the screen. I found Mr. Tolkien to be a very interesting subject and would recommend this book."
4,Not bad for the price,"My 7 year old son received this for Easter, and it's a little frustrating. He has navigated through it, but there are no instructions as to what the objective of the game is, other than to collect items and wait for adventures. Also, the game screen does not fill the monitor, so UBI Soft E-mailed some instructions that will hopefully correct the problem. Graphics aren't bad, and while the software itself has correct instructions as to which botton does what, the accompanying pamphlet has misprinted that the #1 key is for telekinesis, and the #2 key is for healing power, when it's the reverse."
3,Setup is Difficult,"TEAC DR-H300 DVD ReceiverI am using this receiver for audio and radio. But to set up for DVD into the TV one needs a PAL (European standard) setting on the TV and my Samsung HDTV has no PAL setting. I am keeping it as I already have another DVD player, but this is a problem."
5,A life saver highly recommended,"If I don't have anything to keep my 3 year old busy - this does it all the time. He never gets bored of it and for the price you can't go wrong. How many expensive toys with lights and buzzers end up in the garage but play-doh is everywhere, they just love it. And Mom and Dad can have fun too."
5,Great Toy,"I've bought a lot of playdoh, over the years, and this is an affordable assortment of colours. For about $8, you get 10 2 oz cans, which is 1 lb and 4 oz of playdoh.This item also has free shipping on orders of $25 or more, which is great for people, like myself, who need to ship it long distances, since it is kinda heavy. My niece enjoyed it so much, I later bought the 24 can and the 36 can case of playdoh on Amazon, both of which are also very affordable, and qualify for free shipping.Playdoh is just a really great product."
3,These are mini,"I probably just missed it in the description, but note these are not the regular size. They are smaller versions."
2,Very small containers and more $$ than walmart.,"Tubs are very small, holder is cardboard and it is more money than walmart. There is really not much more to say than that. Love playdoh.."
2,Half of the colors were near dry already...,"I decided to skip a trip to Target or Kmart and just order a bunch of playdough online. It was disappointing to see that nearly half of the colors were already nearly dried when the package arrived. What's worse, try explaining this to an excited then confused three year old. This is my first time buying from this supplier. I'm hoping it was just a fluke. In their defense, I didn't send them a formal complaint since I didn't know how to do this via Amazon. I could only find the ""return"" option and within days, the entire ten color kit was useless. It was tossed, not worth going through the trouble of returning."
2,Terrible Quality,Not sure if I got a bad box but the quality of these was so bad I threw them out. I have had store bought play-dough previously and it was elastic and fun and fairly clean. This boxed set was gooey and did not shape well. It just made a mess and was not the same quality at all.
3,Disappointed,"Very small containers. I saw large containers for the same price at a ""box"" store. The quality seems fine but I find the small containers of play doh dry out much more quickly."
3,Good Colors But TINY Jars!!,"I was really excited to get this play-doh for my boyfriend's niece... I thought it would make a great gift. When it arrived I was a bit disappointed because the play-doh jars are TINY. I mean there is hardly any play-doh in each one... I was expecting larger jars.It's good for the variety of colors, but the size of the jars are definitely a bummer. I wouldn't order again."
5,Play Doh just plain rocks!!,Play Doh offered in this many colors can never be a bad thing. It was a great supplemental to the fun factory on Christmas morning. Very pleased with the price and selection. Gotta love Play Doh!!!
5,fun play,"As we all know, this is the most popular doh. My daughter spends a lot of time with this every day. This is the best toy for a young kid."
5,"SUch a great, enduring toy","Playdough is simply the best creative toy for children of all ages - tactile, colorful, waiting to be made into something."
3,its okay,"im not sure why, but for the price i figured there would be alot more playdoh then there is! its okay i guess"
3,so disappointed,So expensive for the product! Then I saw it in Walmart for 1/2 the price I paid (I thought they were the big containers!) and NO SHIPPING! I really feel ripped off with this purchase.
5,Incomparable,"This is an amazing CD. It is rejuvenating, free-spirited, and complex. It is about love, sex, and death. You will want to listen to it over and over again."
3,You could do worse,"OK, people, I'm talking to you. No five star review, I go by Rolling Stone standards and this is a three star album. Several good tracks but there wouldn't be so many remixes of the songs on other albums if they were happy with the final product. PDP was still cutting their techno teeth and didn't refine their sound until Electric Plumawhatever. But, honestly you could do worse, if this is your first PDP purchase, go with Liquid White Light because it captures their live sound very well. Side Note: Don't you hate five star reviews for everything? I do too, and three stars is nothing to be ashamed of."
4,cute Flexi,"nice piece and is matching with my nice puppy, delivered on time and in a perfect condition."
5,Work great,"These make a nice sawhorse for most uses. They are nice and strong and have nice points to grip the cross bar. You can secure with screws or nails, or not - it is up to you. I have mine cut with eight pieces of 2.5 foot long 2x4s for the legs and two eight foot 2x4s for the cross bars. That makes for two 8 foot long saw horses.Note that these are sold in pairs (although the photo only shows one bracket). Thus, you need one pair per saw horse - or two pair if you want two saw horses (which most people want).The ability to assemble and disassemble quickly and easily makes these great for home garage/workshop use."
2,Flimsy,Got the job done but these brackets would be better if they were an inch or two longer. But most importantly they need to wrap around the legs. Simple tabs to the backside of very thin metal bend too easily resulting in a weak saw horse.
5,Great Movie!!,"I purchased the movie for a gift. Amazon billed and sent me one more, by mistake.So I decided to keep it for me and watch it. Enjoyed very much."
4,Flatulence Fantasique!,"You will never forget seeing this movie. Like another reviewer I have carried images from this film in my mind for decades. It's not that it's a great movie, there have been better ""food"" movies - but nothing that has the black humor and the joyful vulgarity of this one. Philippe Noiret's infantile Judge is a wonderful performance and the entire cast holds nothing back. Philippe Sarde's haunting theme is superb - especially in the death by flatulence scene. Funny, farcical and oddly thoughtful beneath the somewhat contrived artiness that is French filmmaking of the 1970's."
4,Memorable,"I saw this movie in 1973 and I've remembered it all these years. A very funny, gross movie for all of us who have ever pigged out."
3,Underrated but not too good either,"Next had great hits with ""Too Close"" and ""Wifey"" so i expected that this album would include dozens of new hits too, but it didn't. It didn't sell to good either, but it aint that bad either, just not those top hits. ""Feels good"" is my favorite, a catchy soulsih uptempo song. And a funky colaboration with Jaheim is good too ""Your love is"". Most of the songs are decent actually, many many slow jams though but they grow on you. ""Just like that"" is good, one of the songs they prove they capabilities in. 16 songs on the cd, i believe a few too much. At the end of the day its a decent album but it could have been alot better."
1,Very Disapointing Album,"Next had a huge flop in the form of the CD, The Next Episode. There's wasn't one song on this horrible opus. Bad production, medicore lyrics and lazy performances makes this CD a snooze fest."
3,Good try .... Better luck next time,"next have always been doin this and this one is no exception. a couple of good songs and the rest is quite week. it is fair to say that a lot of the production is worth a closer look and its very neat, but again .... the same problem, by track 7-8, you start to get bored and wanna tear the CD apart. anyway, at least its a good try ..............."
2,R&B or HIP HOP or POP?,"First of all, I expected this to be a slow and romantic CD like Nextasy, but like most modern R&B, it sends us to the club instead of to the bedroom. It's ridiculous that over half the CD is fast and unromantic. Rap and hip-hop is for the club. If R&B artists like Next, Joe, 112 and Jagged Edge feel the need to up the tempo to R&B, then they should have the decency to group the songs properly instead of making me skip songs. And also, these brothas can't sing all that well, and RL, although the best of the group, still has no power behind his voice and therefore sounds like EVERYBODY ELSE! Truly GREAT R&B died in the mid 90's with Jodeci, Boyz II Men, Silk, Shai, Mint Condition, Babyface(old), R. Kelly, H-Town, Jesse Powell, Kenny Lattimore"
5,gotta luv this cd!!!,"i've been a next fan ever since i heard Too Close. this cd had me hooked from the beginning. i liked their single Imagine That but the tracks that stand out the most to me are Do Your Thing, That's MY Word and Brand New (which drives me crazy every time i hear it.) i can't wait for their next album."
1,R&B or HIP HOP or POP?,"First off, if this is supposed to be an R&B group, then why are over half of the songs on it fast? That's why todays R&B sucks! Joe, Jagged Edge, Next, and many others are trying to send people to the club instead of to the bedroom. That's what rap and hip-hop is for. I expected the Next Episode to be a slow and sensual CD, but I found myself wanting to dance. And at least they should have the decency to group the songs in order like Montell Jordan did on Get It On...Tonight, having fast with fast and slow with slow. The group can't really sing all that well either. RL is the front man and he has no power behind his voice, making him sound nasally like everybody else. R&B died during the days of Jodeci, Boyz II Men, Silk, After 7, Shai, H-Town, Babyface(old), Mint Condition, Jesse Powell, and Kenny Lattimore to name a few."
2,Give it a rest Next,Each time they come out with an album they are a disappointment. Their album always has two or three songs worth listening to and that's it. They are the reason why people download songs off of the internet instead of buying the whole album.
1,Poor quality with no service.,"I purchased one of the these directly from xm. It never worked. XM acknowledged it was defective equipment but refused to refund it. For the most part the xm customer service is absolutely terrible, either ignoring you or providing blow off answers."
4,SkyFi XM Radio,"Easy to use, easy to set up. Had same unit in another vehicle, enjoying the sounds of XM radio on the road."
2,Good... for about 3 hours,"I purchased this to listen to at work. When I first plugged it in, I was very happy. This review is on the product, not the service. I have no cmoplaints about XM service, but this reciever must have never been designed to be listened to for more than 45 minutes at a time. I had on that cut on and off all the time, and I thought it was defective. I received a new one, and the same thign. It is as if the receiver overheats and shuts itself off. After about 1/2 an hour of ""rest"" it will come back on, but beware, only for about an hour. This product is great if you will be in and out of your car, and you do not intend to use it for more than an hour a day. Otherwise, stay clear...nothing but a headache!"
1,Why Get XMSR????? I want NFL & NPR = Sirius!,"I'm sorry, but all my friends have Sirius. XM has absolutely ZERO content. Sirius has NFL games, NBA exclusive, NHL exclusive, NPR (also exclusive) and a ton more content than XM will ever be able to afford.XM is partially owned by Clear Channel. Why keep feeding the pig? Sirius.com and you'll be changed forever.XM, nice try, but Sirius is gonna shine. XM can keep pumping out GM cars with the service in it."
4,Great for Road Trips,"What a great invention. I just had this installed as an aftermarket item on my Suburban. I've had it for 2 months and love it. The product itself is easy to use, logical.The XM service needs to be updated with more stations to listen to."
2,Poor warranty service,"I received a SkiFi receiver for Christmas, it's outstanding! I love it! But when the receiver started malfunctioning 3-months later I had to deal with Delphi's unforgivably poor customer service, definitely something to consider before purchasing."
5,Hot Stuff!,I love my Skyfi. It has the added bonus of coming out of my car and going into my boombox. The music is great. No commercials on 35 music channels and about 2 minutes/hour on the other 30. The comedy channels are great as well. One for adults and one for family. The Skyfi is easy to use. You'll be happy you got it.
5,Digital Radio Like you have never heard before!,"I purchased this unit from ... last week.The sound quality is excellent, and the signal is great. however if you do live in a mobile home, you will need to mount your antenna OUTSIDE to recieve good signal.There is so much to choose from on XM radio, it will take months to sample each and every channel. This is a good upgrade from the HORRIBLE fm reception that we have been listening to for so long! no complaints! i love XM. do your self a favor and GET XM TODAY!!...BE CAREFUL With the face of this unit, it doesn't take much to scratch it!"
5,My 8 year old LOVED it!,"NOTE: This is not a toy and can easily break. For display purposes only.This was the first time I assembled a model with my 8 year old son. With the amount of detail and painting involved, I did most of the work and my 8 year old assisted me. Nonetheless, he LOVED the project. I recommend painting the model with the recommended colors. It brings the play to life, rather than leaving it the drab gray plastic color it originally is. From an educational standpoint, there is a lot of detail on this plane and my son can now identify details such as the dive brake, pitot tube, and tail rudder by name! We took our time and slowly built this model. It was a very good Father/Son project. He now displays it proudly and occasionally plays with it. My son loved it so much that he wanted to start another model when we were done with the Stuka. Our next project: The mighty B-17!"
4,Desk lamp,"This lamp impressed me out of the box. It had a much longer reach than expected, which was a pleasant surprise since I have a large desk. It takes up to a 100w bulb. I am currently using a 60w helical florescent bulb and it works fine. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase and the lamp has met or exceeded my every expectation.Amazon did a great job as usual packing and shipping the lamp. Prime shipping is fantastic!"
1,damage done,"I received one lamp and it had one scratch/ding in it. I returned it and they sent a second, it had a scratch/ding in the exact same spot. I think it was a problem with the manufacturer's packaging method, not the seller's. So I returned the second one as well. The seller was very responsive, but it was a bit of a waste of time."
5,Lamp,I love this lamp! Overall this lamp is very well constructed and is certainly worth the extra money. I found the clamp to be very strong and stays in place on the edge of my desk. The finish is strong and hasn't scratched when it rubbed up against my shelf. All the articulating joints are well constructed and move easily when you need to direct light on a certain object or book. Plus it's made here in the USA which is hard to find these days.
4,"BEAUTIFUL, STUNNING PICTURE.","This is a terrific machine for those of us looking to upgrade the DVD experience. Despite the higher cost, it is well worth the investement. I have a samsung 65"" rear projection television with the DVI input that is HDCP compatible. I cannot believe the difference this provides over progressive scan. To put it in prospective, watch a digital cable or satellite program, then watch a program broadcast in HDTV. Therein lies the difference. There are some quirks with the remote and set up features that are a bit tricky, but definately not anything to dissuade one from purchasing this machine. This is not true HDTV, but darn close. This player will go a long way in satisfying a video conniseur, until HD-DVD is released in 2007. A word to the wise. This unit comes with a DVI cable. Use this for some other purpose if you need it. This cable will not do the unit justice. You NEED to go get the Monster DVI cable, the 400 series is perfect for this application."
1,Two Bad units in a row,I just bought the Sony KV34xbr910 a stunning HDTV ready baby. Purchased the samsung player a week later and the $ 100 cable for DVI..First movie to play was SWars 2 a stunning digital wonder..Just when yoda was about to fight the thing paused..and paused and nothing..Turn off..turn on..no pic..stutter..Return to best buy store and get another New unit..I watched 2 movies and it lost the audio track now..Return..No go..cds pause too..Terrible remote..as all others have said..poor distance to use it too..Sonys are so much better..Bad design..no heat vents..It also says hello and goodbye to you..GOODBYE
4,Good but not great,"I have had this for over a year now. So far, I am satified with it.Pro:DVI-I output is far superior than the run of the mill regular 480p. Pick your choice, 720p or 1080i. Plays all my burned DVD-R's just fine. Sound is good. The unit's build quality is good. Remote can control TV.Con:Very very picky. Does not like VCD's. MP3 and JPEG CD's need to be burned with specific format (ISO 9660, etc..) to work. JPEG display is poor and butt slow. Huge jug-dial that glows blue LED can be annoying (personal preference).Overall, if you primarily use it for DVD or MP3 via DVI connection, it is fine. Anything else, better look elsewhere."
4,Pretty good DVD Player,"BE WARNED - that not all of these players come with the DVI cable. I purchased my through Amazon.com last week and mine did NOT come with a cable. I purchased the $100 Monster Cable.The picture quality of the player is impressive, especially in 720p mode. Quite a bit more information is transferred to the television in that mode than in 420p and there is noticeably more film footage displayed. Overall, the player is probably worth the investment if you have a DVI capable television. Just remember, this player may cost you $229 plus $100 if you are one of the unlucky ones (like myself) that does not receive the cable in the box. Amazon and Samsung really need to rectify that inconsistency considering how expensive that cable is."
1,"Expensive for what it does, fishy quality","My review unit overheated after about 15 minutes, testimony to the South Korean electronics company's poor quality reputation. I also don't see the point of this expensive gadget. You'll do better by getting a high-quality HDTV from Mitsubishi or Philips with built-in decoders."
1,0 Stars in my book,"I recently purchased this samsung dvd-hd931 and have had to return it 3 times. My first one worked fine for a day and then it started smoking and stopped working, my second unit would not work at all, the tray would not even open, my third unit I thought would be the one with no problem, boy was I wrong. Turns out this machine has many bugs, there is a delay in the audio, it feels like im watching a foreign film. The picture also freezes at times. So after all this I finally decided to get my money back and wait for Sony to release a High Def DVD Player."
3,Great Unit But Be Aware!,"If you want to view your dvd's in HD mode, You will have to connect the player using the DVI output.There is no 720p or 1080i output from the component output jacks.If you have a DVI input on you monitor, tv or projector, then this is the unit for you."
2,"Good Picture Quality,But who needs a picture that is froze!","Do not buy this dvd player!It is not worth the money.It does have a better picture when you use the DVI output.But that is the only good thing about this DVD playerWhen you are in the middle of a good movie,say a good action movie.I for one do not enjoy it whe the picture freezes!I don't know how they can put junk like this on the market and get away with it.I have four other DVD players that outdo this one.I was going to have some friends over to show this to,but not now!I do not think anyone wants a DVD player that freezes up right in the middle of a movie.Please take note of the other bad reviews on this crappy dvd player.I wish i had!And YES THE REMOTE IS JUST AS BAD!!!!"
3,"Not bad, needs work.","I've had this one connected to my Panasonic ED Plasma for several months now. Connections: DVI to Plasma, Optical to Denon 2802. Excellent picture quality. Scaling is a little lopsided and needs some work. I HAVE NOT experienced any undesired picture or sound effects. Not a bad DVD player."
1,DVI,"Do not assume this works with a computer screen's DVI inputDo not assume this works with a computer projector's DVI inputThis is disappointing, as it requires a HDCP protocol betweenthe player and the screen, otherwise only noise appears. Evenmore disappointing is no advance caution of this requirement. At least none I noticed."
4,Chess for Kids book,Really good book to help kids understand how to play chess. I bought this for my son who likes to beat his dad at chess! Well worth the money!
3,Not the Greatest Book to Begin with,"CHESS FOR KIDS will get you started with the the very basic rules and will teach you some starting strategies and tactics.Good Things about this book:1) It covers the rules you need to know as a non-tournament player.2) It covers just enough strategy and ideas to get you started.3) Lots of Colour - makes it look attractive.Not Good Things about this book:1) It is written so that young kids cannot understand the level of reading level (should come with a notice: Batteries Required, Opps! I mean older reader required to help young readers),2) The order of things is out of wack sometimes. This can make the learning confusing.There are better books written for the beginner or children. For a teen or older Learn Chess by Alexander and Beach is much better organized and has a lot more depth. There are a couple chess books for the junior beginner that have a lower reading level."
2,Not that great,"I have read about 6 chess books in my school library. I didnot find the teaching to be as serious as it should be for kids over 8 years old. I learned a lot more from ""Chess For Juniors"" and ""ideas Behind the Chess Openings"" in the library."
3,Good Pictures but the way it is layed out is just ok,This would be a very nice book if you are a parent who will be reading it to a younger kid who cannot read very well yet. Otherwise the reading is more at a teenage level at least.The pictures and graphical things are very good! Some of the more advanced rules are a little confusing.
2,Not serious book for kids to learn from,This is indeed a book where pictures are used for entertainment purposes and not a serious book for an older kid to learn from.OK for smaller kids.
2,Attractive pictures but not for serious learners of Chess.,"A typical DK book full of great pictures illustrating the game. But it has nothing for children who already know how to play the game and are looking for advanced topics. In my opinion, this book can get a kid started on Chess."
5,Perfect for my son,"This book truly inspired my 6 year-old son. I was looking for a book to start teaching my son chess and brought this one home from the library. He was fascinated by it, to the point that he was choosing this as his bedtime book and staying up well past bedtime reading it himself. It really sparked his interest in chess! He is now spending almost all of his free time playing chess and this book certainly helped to inspire him."
4,book straight forward and interesting,The book is good for kids to start. My 6 year boy was very interested in the little games in the book.
5,wonderful book for kids and the adults who are trying to guide them,My grandsons are looking forward to being able to play chess with their grandma. Thank you so very much. grandmab
3,Age Appropriate for Young Chess Player,This book was purchased as an accompaniment for chess set given as gift for child. Instructions and skills were age appropriate.
5,Best cd in my clollection,"If you are looking for someone who is more interested in creating great music than in what is popular, then this is the cd for you. I was blown away by the power and emotion that Paul conveys easily. This is easily his best work yet. I can't wait for more. I am just ashamed that this cd received such little airplay in the U.S. and Paul was voted Best Male Vocalist in Canada. This cd is the best in my collection of true country music."
5,Wow :),"Paul won me over with ""That's The Truth"" and since I've come to love him :) This album is a jem :) My favorite song is probably ""A Love That's Strong"" It's a truely beautiful song :)"
1,no help,"I will be a freshman in college in the fall and I always thought my major would be pre-med. I recently decided that going to school for like ten years wasn't for me. So, I decided to buy this book as a career assessment so that I could explore the possibilities and decide what I wanted to do. Well this book was no help. I do not reccommend anyone buy this."
2,A Screed . . . Redeemed Only by Its Lyricism,"""A Small Place"" is a small book of unsubtle reflections about Antigua, the nine-by-twelve mile island in the West Indies where Jamaica Kincaid was born and spent her childhood. Unfortunately, the book is redeemed only by the lyricism of Kincaid's prose. In simplistic fashion, Kincaid explores the legacy of British colonialism and the corruption of Antigua's native leaders. Kincaid acknowledges the splenetic nature of her endeavor, telling the reader to ""look at this prolonged visit to the bile duct I am making, look at how bitter, how dyspeptic just to sit and think about these things makes me."" The book is certainly bilious, a sort of juvenile screed from an author demonstrably capable of more subtle analysis. Read ""A Small Place"" if you're traveling to the West Indies or read it if you're an admirer of Jamaica Kincaid's literary craftsmanship. Just don't expect too much from it."
4,A Small Place with a Worldly Condition . . .,"I first read this book when I found it staring at me in a bookstore in Texas. (I had just begun high school in the early 1990s.) A few months earlier, I had read Kincaid's widely-anthologized short story ""Girl,"" and I knew I wanted to hear the author's voice again on the page. Hence, I found A SMALL PLACE.Kincaid's meticulous description and flow of anticolonial thought asks the reader to leap into the unspoken--domination and hierarchies. At the same time, she questions the role of the tourist and the condition of the native.This book awakens the mind and brings necessary questions for self-actualization."
1,A Bitter Diatribe,"I had to read this for a history class, otherwise it is not worth the time (and there is very little history to boot)."
5,An eloquent essay,"If you consider it an essay on colonisation, it is a very frank and pointed assessment on the effects of colonisation, not only from an Antiguan's point of view, but from an Antiguan who is now staying in America's point of view. Angry, penetrating and brutally honest. A must read for every worshipper of colonisation and its bountiful gifts.As a novel, it is equally stimulating, the style is succinct, terse and eloquent.At the bottom of it, it is expressing sentiments that have been considered rude to voice... until now I guess."
1,just mindless insults,"If you expect a well-reasoned and persuasive essay, look elsewhere. At best, this is the mindless rantings of somebody who's been through a lot and really needs to vent. The only thing she was able to persuade me by the end of the book was that I was an evil person.The book is divided into several chapters. The format is fairly simple: in every chapter, Jamaica Kincaid hates on a different group of people. In the first chapter, she rants about tourists. In the second chapter, she rants about British people. If she focused on one group of people, her argument might make sense, but when she focuses on them all it becomes clear that she just hates everybody. Because she writes the entire book in second person, every insult is directed straight at the reader. I left the book feeling extremely guilty, while at the same time not exactly sure what I had done wrong."
4,READ THIS BOOK,"As I picked this book up in the book store of my university, I thought that this book was going to be another one I'd skim and take an exam on... Not so... Jamiaca Kincaid's story of growing up in Antigua made me read the short novel slowly, absorbing every great detail... The book is detailed in such a way you can see, feel, and hear everything that she does... I actually kept this book..."
5,fantastic,"This was a wonderful book. Antigua is a very ""Small Place"" but it really looks at the big picture and illustrates colonialism and neocolonialism as it happened all around the world. A really heartbreaking portrait of the island of Antigua."
1,What did I just pay for??,"What did I just buy? This book was short and its a good thing. Probably one of the worst books I've ever read. She uses parenthetical statements for pages it seems like and one she never actually closes. Its like no actually edited the book and it was just sent into publication from the rough draft. Plus, there is no plot. It feels like for the most part of the book she is just going on a rant about how much she hates her government and how corrupt it is. Go write for a newspaper honey. What a waste of the two hours it took to read."
2,Be Part of the Solution,This book is full of hate and racism on Kincaid's part. Would she have no tourists? What brings in the money? She should be a part of the solution not continue the problem.
4,100 Designers' Favorite Rooms,"This is a great book, providing pictures of rooms that were created by designers all over the world. There is a very interesting pool, and some cool lighting and floor designers. There are some pictures of about every style from traditional to eclectic."
4,great binoculars for the money,What a difference from my cheap older binoculars! Very crisp and clear. I would recommend for general viewing and birding.
5,Replacement Binocs,I purchased these based on the recommendation of a fellow birder. They were selected due to the longer focal length which allows me to use them without removing my glasses. They are wonderful. The field of view is very bright and clear. I can again focus both eyes through the instrument. An added bonus was the great price.
4,Pleasantly surprised.,"The image is bright and sharp. Only a thin edge of blur around the outer lense, but its barely noticable or in the field of view. They're extremely easy and quick to use. The focus wheel is smooth, fast, and precise. I prefer their lite weight, but I have to plant an elbow or lean against some thing to prevent shake. The bins are smaller than I imagined. They're easy to hold and feel secure in my hands. They are cheapest in online auctions. 2/3 the cost of most web sites. I'm extremely happy with these."
4,Terrific value,"I did a lot of research before deciding. For an amateur birder, these binoculars are hard to beat. Nice wide field of vision, easy to use while one is wearing eyeglasses, clear picture. Friends of mine have more expensive binoculars and after trying mine, wish they had spent less and purchased them instead."
5,Best binoculars ever!!,"I bought these binoculars for an Alaska cruise. To my delight, we brought with us our older binoculars (another well known brand)and we were able to compare the two. With our well known American brand, we could see the shore when steaming along and see trees, etc. But with Nikon Monarch, we could not only see the trees, but the limbs, the birds in the trees, and the bears coming down to the water. In Glacier Bay, we could see inside the crags of the glaciers and spot glaciers high up mountains with detail. My wife and I have decided it's time to sell our older (only a few years) binoculars at our next garage sale. I don't have equal eye sight in each eye. With the Nikon Monarch I can see clearer than wearing glasses and much farther. I highly recommend these binoculars!"
5,Great Binocs,"Very happy with these Nikon's plus I got $50 of product for purchasing during promotional period. Seller is authorized reseller so you get the bonus. This would be a perfect gift. Best product, best price, can't beat it."
4,Perfect for My Needs,Needed a pair for a trip to a tropical locale. Pretty much perfect...only fault...lens cover is a little too loose to be useful.
4,Nikon Monarch ATB 8x42 Waterproof Binocular,"Excellent optical quality, sharp edge-to-edge. Bright, no chromatic aberration is noticable. Easy to carry, handle. Excellent value! It delivers 85% of the quality of a very high end item for 1/4 the price. Recommend highly to birders and other nature-lovers."
2,Need stabilization,"Bought these for an African safari. Bouncing around in the jeeps, they were nearly worthless. Another woman on the tour had stabilization binoculars, which cost about the same as these. They now sit in my closet. Other reviewers say they are good for birding, which we saw many in Africa, but I think other binoculars would have been sufficient."
4,"Gret Binocs, But Hold Onto the Eyepiece Cover!!!","Terrific optics, for the price, and works great with glasses. Only shortfall is the eyepiece cover, which is easy to lose --- which I already have --- even after it is attached, as designed, to the strap."
4,Nikon Monarch ATB 8x42,Impressed with optics for the price. Clear view and easy to use with glasses as noted in other reviews.
4,Key Points,"I found Sennewald's book to be complete, easily understood and worthy of practical application. The book focuses on security management approaches to not only introduce security to an organization, but also to stabilze, enhance and gain support for existing security systems/department. Sennewald foregoes the lock and key discussion to present suggestions every security manager can use. The book outlines organizational systems and explains security's important role in organizations. It concentrates on development of human resources of security departments. The book is an easy read, clear and concise."
1,Not nearly as good as Memories of a Lost Egypt,"In Return to Paris, which covers her teen and early adult years (after she left Cairo permanently), Collette Rossant constantly showed an air of superiority toward others. When she married an American, this trait became even more evident. She was rude to the American Army wives and spent her time alone rather than mingle with them. When she and her husband moved to New York, she acted the same way toward her mother-in-law. While living with her mother-in-law, she wasn't gracious enough to hide her dislike of the food she was served, sometimes refusing to eat it. Yes, a lot of American food was convenience oriented in the 1950s, but there were plenty of good home cooks. CR was from a family who had full-time cooks, and she was a food snob.Her attitude made me not like her and not feel sympathy for the poor little rich girl. I will not buy or read any more of her books."
5,A wonderful conclusion to a gastronomic adventure,"I read this book trying to forget about the stiffling heat we're experiencing in Europe in one day. As wonderful as the first book is (Apricots on the Nile) this book is even better. Collette takes us on her journey back to Paris after being wrenched away from her loving coccoon of close family in Egypt to the great unknown. Soon however she finds solace in the kitchen & rediscovers her passion for food. Faced with many life changing decision, she recounts the events that took her all over Europe & (later to the US) on different adventures & always with food as her loyal companion.A wonderful read that ended too soon, & although I rated this book with 5 stars, I felt it ended a bit too abruptly ... but then again you alawys want more of a great book don't you?!"
3,It is ok,"I had expected more from this book. A little too self absorbed. The recipes though are great. My book club group read it and some of us made some of the recipes to share, everything was delicious!"
5,best Ottoman on the market,"I bought this ottoman and glider chair for my wife Dona. The ottoman is fully upolstered and the sides go down to the ground the furthest of all the ottomans I saw. It is the safest ottoman by far, my kid can not get his fingers any where near the gliding parts , unlike most others!! I can sit on it and I'm 240 pounds. It is also big enough to change my boy on. The ottoman mechanism is the best I have seen on the market it is a very sturdy ( thick solid metal) with percision balanced arms made by Leggett and Platte. They are the guys who make real recliner mechanisms for furniture.I give this ottoman a 5+ for smothness, quality, safty and best gliding mechanism. I recomend that you buy this ottoman and glider. It is the best value on the market and anything close to it will cost you $ $600- $700 more . Save the money and hassle and buy it from Amazon."
3,We had to return ours,I am highly disappointed in this game. We had the same problems other members had. The heads kept coming off track when the hippos were eating the marbles. Not as sturdy as I remember. Very disappointed.
1,Frustrating to the max!,"I feel robbed. The hippos never stay on the base plate, unless you use your other hand to hold them down. Out of 4 hippos, 2 work great, and the other 2's levers stick nearly every time you try to grab a marble. It frustrates us to the max!!!"
2,Too loud + gets stuck = no fun,"I remember playing this as a child and enjoying it a couple of times so I figured I would buy it for my children to play while I did things around the house and boy was that a mistake! The hippo's neck kept getting stuck in a ""locked"" position making it impossible for it to lift its head and grab marbles. This, of course, was very frustrating to my children who couldn't figure out why the hippo hovered over the marble but did not ""eat it up!"". In addition to that...the game is just too darn loud. I would not recommend this toy because it rattles the nerves!"
2,Total disappointment,"Just like most of these reviews, I was so disappointed to find that a childhood favorite has been cheapened so much. The BIGGEST complaint is that they think you are going to take it apart and put it back together every time you want to store it? I don't want it sitting out everyday after my son is done playing with it.And it's SO cheaply made. The marbles are plastic and bumpy. They don't come out of the hippos once gobbled. The hippo's heads get stuck and don't lift up like they should. I could go on but it's mostly what others have said. I wish companies stopped trying to save a buck and just left classics the way they were."
2,Poor quality,"This is not the Hungry Hungry Hippos I grew up with as a child! You actually have to assemble the game each time you play it, and disassemble it to put it in the box! The hippos don't seem to be level, making it very frustrating for my children when their hippo doesn't 'eat' any marbles! Don't waste your money!"
2,CHEAP! Not made like it used to be!,"This game has really gone downhill from what it used to be. It is now very cheaply made, the board isn't even one piece, and the marbles aren't even real... they are plastic! Sometimes the hippos come off the board while we are playing. It's a very cheaply made game that was a waste of money. It doesn't even fit into the box correctly. We were very disappointed and we are on the look out at garage sales for the original game."
2,Not What It Used to Be,"I recently purchased this game for my six and four year olds. I was initially excited only to be disappointed. First the marbles are now made from plastic and fly off the game board when playing. While playing the hippo heads get stuck in the lock position. There isn't anything on the bottom of the game to keep it from sliding around. You have to disassemble the game to put it back in the box for storage. For the price, it is not worth the hassle."
3,Not so Hungry for this one,"I recently purchased this game for my 4 year old son. FOr the price, it is made very cheaply of very breakable plastic. This is not the game that it was 15 years ago when my siblings received it.It's fun, but the hippos separate very easily from the game, and the marbles don't always go into the ""pit"" very well.I was disappointed."
1,Cheap....Cheap....Cheap,"I agree with a couple of the others reviews. This is NOT the game I grew up with! These have light, plastic ""marbles"" and don't a tenth of the weight the good marbles had back when I was a kid so they don't roll as much. Even the hippos themselves are cheaply made. I was so disappointed with how it's now made. Bring back the old game!"
3,This toy could be so much more fun,This toy is a big hit with my children who are three and four.The problem is that it is made cheap and the hippos constantlycome apart from the main part part of the toy.It would be an all time classic for every generation if it were just made more durable.
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought this game for my 5 year old son, because I remebered how much fun I had playing it when I was 5. This is not the same game that I remebered, the marbles are cheap plastic things that aren't even completely round and the whole game would fall apart after just a few seconds of play. We tried 5 or 6 times to get it to stay together, we even tried taping it. Nothing worked, it was in the garbage after just 1 day of use. Do not buy this game!"
2,not what I remember as a kid,"The Hippos kept coming off the base, the necks kept getting locked and the marbles didn't always end up in the tray. they ended up on the floor underneath the hippos. I don't understnad who thought having 5 different pieces (the base and the 4 separate hippos) was a good idea."
1,Sad Cheap Letdown,"In the trend of making things as cheaply as possible to maximize profits, this toy wins a first place prize. As brand new and out of the box, the mouth comes off its hinges during play, the mouth gets stuck open, the balls get stuck inside and you have to disassemble it to get them out. It's just too frustrating to play. Save your money - buy something else."
3,Not made like it used to be.,"I loved Hungry Hungry hippos as a kid. When I took it out of the box I was shocked at how flimsy the plastic is. The hippos get jammed very easily and the ""marbles"" fly and bounce everywhere. Less then a month and some are missing from flying out of the game and disappearing. Although it is poorly made my daughter loves the game. And brings it to us everyday to play. It is impossible to store so it sits right in front of our fireplace so she can get to it easily. Yes it still fun to play but don't expect the same quality made game you had as a kid."
2,Poor Quality Affects the Fun Factor,Four year old loves this game and frankly so do I. Hippos are poorly constructed and sometimes you have to do a timeout so you can fix them.If only they made it like they did 25 years ago. Such a delightful game...if only...And helloooo....you have to pull the whole toy apart and deconstruct the already flimsy turtles so you can fit it back in the box.As long as I can stand it on the living room floor is how long we'll play with it. Too much hassle to pull it apart.
3,Hungry Hippo a timeless toy!,"I guess as a child you don't realize how cheap this toy really is. The yellow hippo came with a ""crease"" in the plastic so it doesn't work properly. And you just can't really play it on the carpet. But overall, still a timeless toy that can teach you child to numbers, colors, to share, to play fair, and the hard lesson of winning and loosing. My 3 1/2 year old loves it - although it is cheaply made. Don't think this falls on the shipper."
2,Very Disappointing!,I bought this game for my four year-old daughter last Christmas because I always enjoyed playing it as a child. Ours completely falls apart whenever you try to play. The hippos fall apart every time you push down the lever. Very poor quality! I don't remember this happening to mine as a child. I would not recommend this game!
4,"Great Game, Bad Durability","I love to play this game. It is so much fun and it doesn't get tiring to play. The only problem I had with it was its durability. The game easily scratches with the constant pressing of the buttons. It scratched up the first time I played with it. Overall, it is alright."
3,Love the Toy...Not the Setup,"Why did they have to mess with a good thing?? I had this game when I was little, and it was all one piece. Now, the hippo's come off for storage. It doesn't stay together very will during play, and the balls get stuck inside sometimes. They should have left the design alone!! It is still a fun game, and my kids love it, but I spend most of my time putting it back together for them."
1,Toy arrived without a hippo head - No replaced given,I asked for new hippo head and they wrote back saying they didn't have any hippo heads at this time.Really?
2,They don't make 'em like they used to...,"I remember enjoying this game as a kid, but it must have been a much higher-quality product than this cheap rendition. From a kids' perspective, it's frustrating because the heads often get ""stuck"" in the extended position and won't spring back; from a parent's perspective, it's a pain to assemble, and nearly impossible to disassemble (and you MUST disassemble it if you want to fit it back into the small box. Why they can't sell this in a larger box I don't know, but I guess they're saving money on packaging). If you DON'T manage to get it back into the box (which I only did once), it must be stored as is, with no receptacle to contain the marbles, and a shape too awkward and bulky to fit easily on a shelf. I finally sneaked this thing away into my give-away pile, after only 6 months of use, and I hope the kids forget all about it."
5,"Fun, fun, fun","Christmas gift for my 40 year old daughter. Seems Santa never got it for her when she asked for it as a little girl. NOw she is having the fun and playing it with her three year old.See,Santa finally got it right and all is well, and it is such a fun game."
3,I wish they made a heavy-duty version!,This classic toy really is fun but not quite sturdy enough for excited preschoolers! I remember this game from 20 years ago and it was much sturdier. I would gladly pay more for a deluxe heavy-duty version with better working parts.
1,"Cheap, Flimsy, & Poorly Made","This cheap knock-off is nothing like the great game you grew up with. The pieces are flimsy, you have to take the whole thing apart just to store it in the box, the levers constantly stick, and even the marbles do not have the same weight they used to have. My son lost interest almost immediately; the old game was much more durable and you could bang the heck out of it and it would not break. With this model, if you push too hard the hippos just fall off the base and you have to constantly keep re-assembling it. If you want your child to play this game and enjoy it, [...]. If you are new to this toy, keep looking. Don't waste your money (17.00!!!) on this lousy piece of junk."
2,Disappointed,"I remember playing this game as a child. While it is not entirely educational, it was fun. I was very disappointed when my 3 year old took this game out of the box. It was not the quality I remembered. Each hippo was not permanently attached to the board, they only sit on the game board by placing two tabs in a slot. During a heated game with my 3 year old, not only do the hippos we are playing with come off, so do the others, then the marbles fall off of the game board and the activity comes to a complete stop. The marbles themselves aren't even marbles, they are plastic and are just barely enough weight to play with. I am surprised that the quality has gotten so poor with the passing years."
1,this game is a pain in the hippo,"My son wanted this game sooooo bad--and I remembered playing it as a kid and enjoying it so I got it for him even though I had some reservations. Ugh! The thing is very cheap, the hippos come apart, ostensibly to help you ""store the game"" inside the box, but the fact of the matter is they come off too easy, don't store well, and nothing fits back in the box appropriately especially when a four-year-old tries to put it away. He doesn't play with it that much and I think it might ""disappear"" into the attic for a while and if it's forgotten, I can ditch it once and for all. Oh, and all you moms with babies out there, obviously the marbles pose a choking hazard AND it's so darn noisy! Spend your money on something else."
1,This toy is absolutely horrible,"I will NEVER buy anything from Hasbro. My son received Hungry Hungry Hippos for this birthday. One of the four hippos never worked--pieces were missing from the box. The plastic is so flimsy that the other three get hung up and rarely work. You can't put the game away without taking the hippos off (no small task--I have pinched my fingers several times), and no child can do it alone. It is absolutely the worst toy we have ever had the misfortune of receiving."
3,Why did they have to mess with a good thing?,"I had this toy as a child and loved it. I wish my parents had kept it so I could have passed on the original, more durable toy to my kids. I remember it being one piece and fitting into the box just fine. We got it yesterday and haven't had any trouble with it staying together. Our problem is we can't get it to disassemble to put back in the box. We're also running into the problem of the plastic balls popping back out of the hippos mouths. Our 2 and 4 year old play this game with one hand hovering above it so they can catch the marbles the hippos ""spit out"" and shove them back in. Sometimes the heads of the hippos get stuck and you have to really smash the lever to free them. The kids really love the game so I'm glad we got it but I was so disappointed to see how the quality has suffered. It doesn't look as if it will be very durable but so far we haven't had any problems. We'll be building a better box for storage since we can't get it to disassemble."
1,I Hate Hippos,"I was only 4 when it happened. This is a TRUE STORY. This really happened.My older cousin Kiana, was playing ""Hugry, Hungry Hippos."" The game would not work and it fell apart. She was 6. Her and her friend Darlene decided it would be a good idea to suck on some of the marbles. Kiana fell down and swallowed 4 marbles and was sent to the emergency room. Luckily, she survived, with a surgery resulting in huge medical bills.Kiana almost died from this, she was 6.Hungry Hippos teaches NOTHING except for bad idea and horrible accidents.Please do NOT, NOT, NOT buy this for children under 7. Infact, don't buy it at all. I doesn't work, and if it was 1 penny more cheap, it would be made of cardboard"
1,Terrible quality,"This is a poor quality version of the original game. The hippos get stuck constantly, the balls don't roll well (since they are injection molded plastic with flaws from the process), and the board feels like it is constantly breaking."
3,This is not the game I grew up with!,"My daughter got Hungry Hungry Hippos for her birthday. The whole family loves it. Unfortunately, the game is not as durable as it used to be. The hippos fly off at any given moment without any notice and marbles tend to soar across the room.Not to mention, you have to play on a hard surface, or the heads don't pop up right. This is somewhat difficult since we have carpet through our house and a big kitchen table isnt convenient for 4 people to lean across."
1,Why mess with a good thing,This was such a disappointment. They should have left the original game alone. It was sturdy and had real marbles. The new version comes apart while playing and the plastic marbles are lightweight and fly off the board constantly. I am searching flea markets and yard sales now for one of the old versions of this game. SAVE YOUR MONEY!! Don't buy this unless they re-make it again and get it right.
3,Low Quality Made it difficult to play,"My 3 1/2 year-old-son received this game from Santa. He was very excited to play, but because the hippos are cheaply made, he kept knocking his entire hippo off the game board. After 2 or 3 tries he became too frustrated to keep trying. Would be a fun game if only it were made better. Our older daughter (5) had more fun--she wasn't as aggressive hitting her hippo button!"
2,Garbage!,Milton Bradly/Hasbro should be ashamed of themselves. Very cheap materials that don't work right most of the time. I only gave it up to 2 stars because my kids have fun counting the marbles while I fix the hippo heads for the zillionth time during our 15 minute playing session.
2,Very Cheaply Made,"We have the same complaints as others... this game is sooooo cheaply made, especially for the price!! The marbles are light plastic and seamed -- they don't roll as well as they could. The hippos detach sometimes during play, one seems to not want to ever be attached. The levers get stuck sometimes, sometimes the balls get stuck in their throats. It is all very Flimsy. Trying to store it again is a joke.That said, my kids still like it. It is unbelievably NOISY, and I think that's what they like, plus it's very fast paced. I would never play it with a very competitive child, they would drive you nuts complaining about how their hippo wasn't working right or whatever. The best part is flipping the balls into play with the springy thing, they pop really high.We play on a carpeted floor, so the board doesn't move as much and stray balls don't get away too badly."
2,"Fun, but won't last","I bought this game for my five-year-old for Christmas because I enjoyed it as a child and because they were out of Moon Sand! The game comes in pieces -- the square base, the four hippo bodies and four hippo heads. When you put it together, it doesn't fit in the box. The instructions suggest taking the hippos off for storage. They have a picture of how to arrange it, but it doesn't fit in the box that way. You can tell on the picture the pieces are hanging over the edge. So you have to take at least one hippo head off to make it all fit. Putting it together isn't too much trouble but the pieces are evetually going to wear out and not snap together. I don't expect this toy to make it until next Christmas unless we find a place to store it out of the box.The game is really fun, parents will even enjoy playing it with the kids. Just don't expect it last forever."
4,Beware of Hungry Hungry Toddlers!,Be careful leaving toddlers around this game unsupervised. I remember when I was a kid we had this game and my little brother swallowed one of the marbles and it got stuck in his windpipe! It's a fun game though & simple enough for young kids to play.
4,"Fun, but NOISY!","This is one fun game from my childhood, but noisy as can be! If you don't mind the noise from the marbles, hippo heads slamming up & down & the giggles/laughs from your children- buy this game."
1,"cheap plastic, jammed hippos, irate customer","I agree with the other reviews that state that this game is made of cheap plastic and joints that cause the hippos to jam, the ""marbles"" to fly, and the tears to fall. Come on MB - you know the kids are going to hit those levers hard - that was the funnest part of the game when we were kids. This version actually has negative economic value to us and I would not only think twice before buying another MB game, but I will insist on opening the packaging to see the quality (or lack thereof) before buying it. So not cool MB. Not only did you ruin it for my 4 year old, but you betrayed one of my memories and thus any affinity for your products."
1,Don't Buy This for Your Child,"I just bought this game for my daughter, because I remembered it from my childhood. What a mistake! The pieces that form the hippos do not snap in tightly. The necks and mouths of the hippos get jammed so the game is hardly fair. I wish I had my money back. I would recommend trying one of the fine games for preschoolers made by eeboo (Ex: Picnic game, the Paper Doll game, or the Make a Pie game)."
4,The old version is better but this is still fun.,"My daughter loves to play this game. She is 2 1/2 years old. We catch the marbles (we each use 2 hippos), then we count how many marbles we got. The only problems I have with the game is that sometimes the marbles get stuck in the hippo (and we have to stop and perform surgery). Also, the box is not quite big enough. The lid sits a little crooked. I remember this game as a child and this is seemingly cheaper version...but still tons of fun!"
2,Poor construction,"My 3 year old got this for Christmas and every time we play, we have to unstick the necks, reattach the hippos, or unjam the marbles. She gets very frustrated and wants me to fix it. How can I fix a shoddy design? I'm very disappointed in this product."
3,Not like the original,"This is a spin off of the ""old"" hungry hippos game. It is now cheap plastic that is rather difficult to assemble, one of our levers to open the hippos mouth gets stuck all the time, the marbles are plastic (Remember when they were REAL glass?) the assembly is a pain and trying to figure out the ""repackaging"" of each hippo is time consuming and aggravating. Overall it's a good idea for a toy, but nothing like the sturdy, higher quality, original."
2,Doesn't fit back into the box!,"it's just as fun as you remember, and it's fun to introduce your child to this game.But once you assemble the game it does not fit back into the box. So you are left with this cumbersome game and tons of loose marbles. Good luck keeping your game room tidy with this game.Also, the heads and necks get stuck. You're trying to gobble gobble gobble but your hippo gets paralyzed. It's very frustrating.The kids will have fun with it, but you might want to think about gobbling up a different game.And finally, our game arrived with the yellow hippos head! Uggh!"
4,"Fun, but noisy","We got this game for Christmas, both my daughters love it, they are 5 1/2 and 3. It tends to be a loud, very exciting game to play. Not the best if trying to have a nice quiet ""game-nite"" time. But very fun for all ages!"
4,A means of keeping your toddler occupied,My 2 year old son enjoys it and it keeps him busy for sometime when I get to cook!Design issues with the toy:1. The hippos keep coming off the stand while playing.2. sometimes the balls get stuck in hippos throatOverall it is a good toy.
2,This toy has gotten cheap,"I used to have this game as a kid and my brother and I played with it all the time. I just bought one for my 3 1/2 yr. old son and it is awful. The plastic is cheap and we always have to stop playing because the hippo's ""tail"" sticks or the head does not go all the way down to catch the balls. I have taken every piece apart and put it back together again following the directions exactly and we still have the same problems."
2,Very dissapointed,"My son received this gift for Christmas two years ago. I was very excited as I remember playing this game as a child. I was soooo disappointed!! It is definitely NOT the sturdy game I remember from my childhood days. The hippos tend to get stuck w/the handles down. For the adults...not a problem...but very frustrating for little ones. And the ""marbles"" don't roll around very well. Overall...not a good buy in my opinion."
2,Disappointed by Hungry Hungry Hippos,"I was very excited to give this game to my daughter on her 5th birthday, since I played with one as a child. I was quickly disappointed. Hungry Hippos is not the same as it was originally. The original had real marbles which worked much better than the new light weight plastic ones. It also was a lot sturdier. About five times in our first game the lever that operates the hippos got stuck. This was very disappointing to my daughter who has no interest in playing again."
3,Cheaply Made,"I loved playing this game as a child! I bought it for the children I watch. They absoutely loved the game. They did not get the basic idea though and ended up throwing the marbles and what not. The game is cheaply made. It kept falling apart and I had to re-attach the hippos at each new game. The marbles are also small cheap plastic. Good game, kids love it, but it is made poorly."
2,FALLS APART!!!,Not the Hippo game you played as a child because this one FALLS APART like crazy. CHEAP!!! Kids loved til they got sick of it falling apart. Too bad...
3,Disappointing durability,"I agree with other reviewers about the durability of this game. The kids love to play it, but the hippos don't stay connected. Also, the marbles are kind of cheap. All in all, a good classic game."
2,"Great Concept, Cheap Construction","I LOVED this game as a kid so you can imagine my excitement for my little one to play this game. Was the construction this cheap back in the 80s? From the start, one of the hippos did not work at all. Another hippo's head moved but the head did not lift off the board so it just pushed the balls around. This game really is a classic. I hope that they will ""upgrade"" the game so that it can really be enjoyed."
1,cheaply made,"Very cheaply made, hippos don't stay attached.This was a christmas gift for my kids (4 & 5)and even though they play with it (rarely), it getsfrustrating when the hippos constantly fall off. Andwhen you wack the hippo a few times, it gets stuck andwon't open to accept the marbles. Definatly not worththe money. Too bad they don't make it like they did ageneration ago."
4,New but not Improved,"I played this game as a kid so bought it for my kids. At first the game looks the same but there have been some changes. This version needs some asembly (I suppose so it will fit in a smaller box) the hippos start coming off when the kids are playing. ( the original game was one piece) also the hippos mouth buttons stick sometimes and do not run smoothly. While they are playing I start hearing alot of complaints like ""mine is sticking"" or ""yours is working better than mine"" or ""this hippo is junk I want that one next time"""
3,Hippos had changed,"When I was a kid, the game was a whole piece and the marbles were better made. Now the game is in pieces and sometimes they break apart. They changed the game to make it more cost efficient but forgot about the bummer it can be when it breaks apart mid game."
2,Hungry Hungry Hippos,This game is not as well made as we older people remember it. One of the heads on the hippos will not even lift up when the lever is pushed and one of them will not retract after the lever is pushed. My daughter likes it if we are the only ones playing because two of them do work. But it does not work like I remember it.
2,"Fun for youngest toddlers, but gets stuck a lot","I agree with the others about the hippos getting stuck, not lifting their heads, etc. Only the youngest toddlers get some fun out of this, basically making noise, and eventually getting the plastic marbles. Since the hippos are not all working the same way, older kids who are more competitive will argue and fight for the better hippos and this takes away from the fun. I usually just settle for the worse hippo, the one that gets stuck and rarely lifts his head, just to let my toddler win. I tried filing the hippos' jaws to make them more rounded and more likely to open, but it seems to only help a little. There is a small educational value in learning to count. But any child that is old enough to count will quickly get frustrated by the uneven performance of the hippos."
2,Just not very durable,"My daughter always wants to play with it, but the levers stick, the hippos fall off, etc... You also have to take the hippos off in order for it to fit back into the box. They are very easy to take on and off, but because of that, they also seem to slip off during play sometimes. Maybe it's our carpet, but it's the only place she has to play. As for marbles, they only give you 1 extra. My daughter is very anal about storing things back, and even with that, we constantly lose the marbles. The last thing is that she loves to play with it for a couple of rounds, and then it bores her. I do like the game, but lately I am much more into quality and durability of games.I'm trying to minimize the amount of junk we have, and I ended up getting rid of this game. It just constantly needed attention when she played."
1,Poor quality,"This game is manufactured differently now then when I was a kid. The hippos have to be removed to pack it into the box, if you can even get them to fit. The plastic is cheap and one of the hippos wouldn't even work when we first took it out of the box. Definitely don't understand how it's supposed to last over time, especially considering the object of the game. Very disappointed."
3,They don't make em like they used to,I used to play with this toy about 20 or so years ago. I bought one for my daughter the other day and was dissapointed by the quality.First off. The balls were plastic now instead of glass. As a result they were unable to roll around because of the seam on them. Second The hippos kept jamming up and would not work.
1,This was a dud,This toy was a disappointment because:* The balls did not roll around the hippos evenly* There was so little skill requirement involved* There was so little variability in the rounds* There was so little excitement generated
4,Passion to the Core,One thing this versatile artist has never been short on is raw talent. She proves it again in Memphis Princess. R
5,ONE OF THE TOP 10 BEST ALBUMS IN ROCK HISTORY!,"1 year after another masterpiece,(FACE THE MUSIC)Jeff Lynne and co. returned with their best record.TELEPHONE LINE and LIVIN'THING are 2 of ELO's greatest songs.DO YA and ROCKARIA are some of the hottest rockers they ever recorded.SHANGRI-LA,MISSION,TIGHTROPE,and SO FINE are all excellent songs that should have been hits.Jeff Lynne is the most underrated songwriter in rock music.With the exceptions of TIME and SECRET MESSAGES,every ELO album is terrific;and A NEW WORLD RECORD is at the top of the list."
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME,"This is one of the best albums I have ever listened to. Rockaria!, Mission, So Fine, and Livin' Thing are excellent songs. Above the Clouds is okay but not as good when compared to the rest of the songs. Other than that this album couldn't be better. I (and surprisingly the rest of my family) can listen to this for hours on end. Don't hesitate to buy it."
5,Perfect,"One of the greatest records of all time, the quality of the cover is amazing, high gloss with bright and vibrant colors, comes with a very nice sleeve for the LP, overall a no brainer for any rock music collection"
5,1976 all over again,"I'd been looking for this one for awhile, especially when I found out that all of ELO's albums had been remastered. This ""extended"" version of New World Record doesn't disappoint. The original album is intact, and the extra tracks are tacked on to the end, which keeps the integrity of the original recording. It sounds great! I'll have to pump up the volume in my car for better effect. Jeff Lynne is still a brilliant, visionary musician, songwriter and producer, and ELO was a massive part of my teenage years--this album especially. And I couldn't believe the price."
3,"good music, compressed remaster","Compared to original CD edition it is 4,5db louder, slighly saturated (peaks are chopped). It might be better for listening on a noisy environment, but it has less dynamics. Besides that sound quality and eq of both editions are very similar, new one is barely brighter. Unlike Out Of The Blue in which new edition is clearly worst than the old one, this one doesn't sound bad, but it's not better, I would stick with the old one if it wasn't for the bonus tracks."
2,"With one exception, pretty mindless pap","If it weren't for the magical Telephone Line, you could happily forget this insipid pap had ever been recorded. Very little of this record sticks in the mind for more than two minutes."
5,Classic ELO,"As far as I'm concerned, ELO's ""A New World Record"" completely stands the test of time and is one of the best rock albums, ever. It's every bit as good as the Beatles ""Abbey Road,"" the Moody Blues ""On The Threshold Of A Dream,"" or Genesis ""Selling England By The Pound."" This remastered edition takes the sound quality to a new level. There isn't a weak song on this CD but my two favorites are ""Shangri-La"" and ""Mission (A World Record).""My shangri-la has gone awayFading like the Beatles on Hey JudeShe seemed to drift out on the rainThat came in somewhere softly from the blueI'm getting out of loveWhere is my shangri-la?I'm getting out of love....."
4,Great remastering job on an excellent album.,"This is what remaserting should be about. A great album with much cleaner, transparent sound quality. Add a few interesting extra tracks into the pot to make a must buy for ELO fans. This album was great in it's time and stands up well for me. I am a big Jeff Lynne fan and love ELO."
5,Incredible!,"I must say, this is Disney's--no, ONE of Disney's best--Princess soundtracks. I have both the Disney Princess Ultimate Song Collection and this one, but this one has some songs I haven't learned yet. My favorite song is Put It Together, which has the Fairy Godmother's special magical phrase, ""Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo."" And it also has some songs that remind me of why I think Cinderella should be known as the Princess of Hope. Thank you, Disney."
3,Yahtzee Game Review,"Hard to figure out the prices on these games, however the older models are selling for a lot more and are used. Overall satisfied with purchase. Shipping was fast and arrived as ordered."
4,Yahtzee hand held,"This ""toy"" has given me countless hours of entertainment while I wait in doctor's offices, airports, and during endless tv commercials. Don't know what I would do without it. It never gets boring."
5,What a score!,"I picked up this game and played it solid for 2 days in order to beat my boys 458. Gutted when I got 457 at one time but soldiered on and managed to get 716! Yep, seven hundred and 16. I think I got about 6 yahtzees and non-zero scored all categories. The last roll was to fill in my 6s which was unusual and I only got one in 3 rolls but apart from that I couldn't have done much better. I was so stoked! Great little package and so addictive. Everything you need is there and it also supports Jokers and subscore checking which is essential for when score attacking gets serious. A+"
4,Favorite airplane entertainment,I've had my handheld Yahtzee game for years and it still works great. I've never had to replace the batteries. You can play this game like a zombie for hours and before you know it you're at your destination!
4,"Adults will ""borrow"" this toy from children.",I took this with me on the plane when I went to vist my aunt. When she played it she became addicted and now she wants one! It's entertaining for plane trips and waiting rooms or just when you have nothing to do.
5,"Addicting, but FUN!",I tried this toy at a friend's house and I was hooked! I bought one for myself and 2 as gifts. They make great toys for long car trips because you never get bored with it!
1,Junk when compared to the original Milton Bradley Electronic Yahtzee Game,Received one of these as a gift around six months ago. I have had several since the original Milton Bradley ones were marketed. Loved them and they all died of old age and use. None were like this thing. The switch buttons are too small and too closely spaced. Might be easier to play if you have fingers the size of pencils. Likes to erase your high scores when it wants to and sometimes just stops working. Checked the Mercury Cell battery and it's holding up far better than what its sitting in. Can't find new original design ones anyplace. This thing is more frustration than it's worth. JUNK!
4,yahtzee,Fun easy to learn does not need instructions to figure it out can travel and play anytime portable can go into your pocket
5,My Husband Won't Put It Down!!!,"I had one of these several years ago, actually it was my children's, but I couldn't put it down. I recently bought another one, as that one was lost, and now my husband can't put it down!!! It is a great way to play Yahtzee quietly and by yourself!"
3,Disappointed,"I bought two of these hand held for my grandsons who enjoyed mine when they visited. I ordered them each one and was surprised at the $12. cost but inflation and all,I understood. Upon receiving it, I was pleased to have found them (shopped everywhere for them) with out screen touch feature and enjoyed giving them to the boys. After using it while visiting them I realized the quality was nothing like the hand held 2002 Hasbro model I had paid $5. for at Walgreens a few years ago. The casing is red and gold and the buttons you could actually feel. My youngest had constantly played with it for 3 hours and it died. We had to reset the back. Glad to see they still exist but the quality is not the same."
4,Yahtzee hand-held game,I bought this for my husband who had a hand held game of Yahtzee for several years. His worn out and he asked me if I could find him another one. I told him Amazon would probably have one. I ordered him one and he is loving it.
4,New White Electronic Yahtzee,"This handheld is just as much fun as the original Red & Yellow version. The case is now White (does not look as shown in the picture) and a bit thinner, however, the layout of the buttons and the play is just as intuitive and addicting."
4,Highly Addictive!,"My sister Madge brought her Yahtzee game to the hospital to give me something to do while I was waiting for her to have a procedure. I played a few games and put it down, but a couple of minutes later, I found myself reaching for it again. Soon, I realized I was hooked! I found it on Amazon, and purchased my own immediately. A fun, simple game that really helps make time fly!"
2,It's ok,"Be aware that the finish, which says glossy is in fact very high gloss. Very Very high shine. I would not have ordered it if the picture had been accurate. It looks like a lovely, flat finish mahogany but looks almost like plastic. However, it is very nicely finished inside with lots of room; so if you don't care what it looks like on your dresser, go ahead and get it."
5,Very nice & excellent laser for the price,"I own 3 of these because it's very fast, has enough features, and the toner cartridge does last quite awhile (not like those pain in the neck inkjets). Brother makes competing models but I'm not sure on their quality. HP and Lexmark tax too heavily for their toner (ridiculous) and they have a tendency to use small cartridges in their lower price printers.For toner, checkout etechwarehouse.com."
1,"Does not hold up, poor site support","After a year with this printer the envelope feed no longer works. Attempts to find information on the site bring offers to advertise more Samsung products. This product may still be on the market, but it is not worth what it costs. The new cartridges, furthermore, are outrageously expensive. (We have had the Samsung for 1.5 cartridges, as we do a modest amount of printing.) It worked well in the beginning, but not we will either need to repair it or buy a new one. Not cheap at this rate."
2,Cheaply made,"I bought this on 1/11/04. Its not so great. The feeding device for fed paper is very cheaply made and simply not very good. On mine, the envelope would only print through the back door, not into the regular well. I had a 1210 which died after 10,000 pages. This one is DOA. Beware."
2,One more thing re warranty,"If it is DOA, Samsung will only replace it with a remanufactured unit (if you are unable to lug it to their service center). So, you pay for a new one, it dies within one year, and you get a remanufactred one in its place. No more Samsungs for me. HP seems the way to go."
1,It Leaks,"This cup was recommended to me when I was transitioning my daughter off the bottle. She definitely did the best with this cup over all other sippy cups (I have a cabinet full - of one of every brand), and I noticed her milk intake definitely increased when drinking from the nuby. But the darn things leaks all over the place. I thought I had a ""bad batch"", so I threw them out and bought new - just to find the same problem. I'm planning to use them just a while longer until I am confident my daughter is used to the sippy cup, then all of them are going in the trash."
1,Bad Choice,"When trying to get my son to transition from bottle to sippy cup we bought this one first. What a mistake. He never really sucked on it, he would chew on it to get his water out. And he would push the spout down almost inside-out causing the rest of it to sink in and then it would leak all over the place."
1,Worst Sippy Cup,I hate this product it is the worst sippy cup I have ever used. I thought that the soft silicone spout would make for an easier transition; but cup leaks and the spout does not line up properly. My son also hates it. Don't waste your money.
1,This cup is awful!,"I bought two of the Twin Handle Cup with No-Spill(tm) drinking Spout cups at a local store and contrary to their ""No-Spill"" name, they leak all over the place - from the base and from the cup. Thankfully, they don't also leak from the spout. I didn't have the cups but two weeks and they fell apart. I have not washed them in the dishwasher so have no idea why they would fall apart. The base and handles are one piece and they just don't stay together with the cup. My local store will not let me return them and I have not been able to get in touch with anyone at Luv 'n Care. I'm disappointed b/c my daughter loved the cups, but I can't use them with this amount of leaking. I do not recommend this cup until they perfect it."
3,"good for teething, spout doesn't line up, worth a try","Once my son got into the ""oral stage,"" (around 3 months) he began to chew on EVERYTHING and the doctor recommended starting him on a sippy cup at 4 months. This was the only cup st Babies R Us that was labeled as young as 4 months and I noticed it had a soft tip so I thought we'd give it a try. My son loved chewing on it more than actually drinking out of it. At the time, he would not take a pacifier, but would chew on this, and everything else but the paci. He is now 7 months and no longer uses it (and hasn't for a while), this is what we concluded:Pros: * suitable for a 4 month old learning to hold a cup* good for teething* no leaks if child throws it aroundCons: * impossible to line up handles with spout* hard to drink from (liquid will come out when chewed on, but the spout has to be completely in child's mouth)** Yes, I would recommend this item **"
1,Cup leaks,"I'm definitely disappointed with this sippy cup. After the first dishwasher cleaning (top rack) the cup now leaks and the leak is NOT coming from how the nipple was secured. I like the soft nipple, but it's back to finding another type/brand."
1,Baby pulls/bites at silcone and comes apart from lid,"Like the title states my baby pulls and bites at the lid which is silicone which in turn makes it very easy to come apart from the plastic that holds the silicone lid in place. With that in mind I am sure you can see the mess I had with cleaning up liquid from the floor, clothing, etc. Since the product was so awful I taught my baby how to sip through a straw, it takes a little time, and it is very worth the time. My baby now does not have to tip anything upside down to get the liquid out. Like the normal sippy cups. We go to restaurants and we get a kid cup with a straw and my baby sips through it like a pro. Buy the way my baby is only 10 months old!! Try Munchkin My First Straw Cup"
1,these aren't worth it,"it takes too long to fidgit with to get a good seal when capping cup, plus i've had a number of the handles break from constant throwing on the ground. I found another Nuby product I really liked much better the nipple pieces are smaller but they have worked well for about 8 months."
1,the worst,"I have 3 different types of nuby sippy cups and these are the worst. I wish I could find the ones I like, but I don't see them on Amazon and I bought the last 3 in the store."
2,My daughter loves them . . . I hate them,"These (and the Nuby gripper cups) were the only 'sippy cups' that I could get my daughter to use after stopping breastfeeding. Yet, now at 18 months, she still only wants these cups and they leak horribly and are time consuming to prepare. Even after the tedious job of lining up the notches perfectly (and the silicone spout often slips when you screw it onto the cup, so you often have to take it out and line it up all over again), we often get leaks from some other minor problem in the lid. I have to triple check every aspect of the lid to ensure no major leaks.Also, the spouts break very easily (which causes major leakage), and I have had to keep replacing them. I am desperately trying to break my daughter of these cups."
1,They LEAK because the design is terrible,We bought three and within a few days they all leaked from the bottom of the plastic cup. I noticed that when our child dropped one of them from the high chair they came apart but easily snapped back into place. The design problem is there is slack in the way the plastic cup sits in the two handed handle. In the normal everyday operation of tightening the top on so it does not leak the force actually tears small holes in the cup because the base actually rips the cup apart. The plastic is so flimsy its like paper. This should be recalled and we should all get our money back!!!
1,Made of unsafe polycarbonate plastic,"These cups are made of polycarbonate plastic, which is a known toxic plastic, especially unsafe in food/drink storage. Nuby makes other two handled sippy cups that are made of safe polypropylene plastic. Cups made of unsafe PC plastic are usually clear and hard, while cups made of safe PP plastic are softer and ""clouded"" plastic."
2,tip cracks too soon n leaks after,"it is a very good training cup when new. but after a few use, the silicone tip cracked easily, then it leaks terribly of course. if one does not mind constantly buying replacement top part for it, then it's fine, but it gets pricy. I am changing to a different cup."
1,horrible.,-nipple is WAY too big for my 7 month olds mouth-very difficult to line up lid with the cup
2,DON'T LIKE,"I usually do my research before buying new products. But, didn't do as much when looking for a sippy cup. I thought this one would be better when compared to the others. I did speak with one parent and she told me it was okay, but showed me a defect with another well known brand. Well, I'm not pleased. The spout leaks and collapeses and is a bit too large for my son's mouth. I've tried loosening it a bit, but that doesn't help. I only use it when absolutely necessary. Will definitely not recommend this one..."
1,Lid caves in & child is soaked!,"I purchased this cup as a first sippy cup for bottle weaning -- becuase of the ""leak proof"" feature and the soft silicone spout. My 10 month old took to it right away. As most all children of this age do, he would chew on it but he had no teeth and it didn't harm the cup. However, in seconds of his using the cup he was completely soaked all down the front of his shirt because the entire silicone lid caved in causing all the liquid to escape. This cup is not leak proof and a very bad design. So, a couple of months later I decided to try the Nuby ""Flip n' Sip"" also a ""no spill design."" It has a straw; which I am told by dentists is better for the child's teeth and mouth in the long run. It too leaks when the cup tilted back... which is natural for anyone to do while drinking. I would not recommend either of these products and am re-thinking this brand all together."
1,Sippy Cup,I bought this cup for my daughter but it in less than a week it started leaking... very disapointing...
3,soft top; too soft for teeth and fingers!,"PROs: soft, safe (silicone) spout; nice colours; easy to clean.CONs: spout slits will tear easily with poking little fingers, gnawing little teeth, resulting in leaking when left sideways; replacement spout more costly (after shipping) than whole, new unit.The issue of difficulty lining up the spout cap notches with the retainer ring guide bumps was irritating, but a non-issue for me; still works (no leaks) even when off alignment. Also, even if a child were to chew off the silicone spout slit bits and accidentally eat them, the bits are tiny (not a choking hazard) and safe to ingest (chemically inert).Luv N' Care Customer service wrote me saying to expect at least 4-5 weeks of regular usage, but recommends getting a cup with a hard spout top if your baby's got chompers and probing digits.Yes, it's a shame it doesn't last longer, but remember it's fairly cheap and given the cost, it's not a bad value."
2,"Good transition cup, but very short lived","Because my daughter wouldn't take any of the other sippy cups I offered her, I tried this very soft topped Nuby sippy cup. She finally figured it out with this cup! But after a few uses the handles wouldn't line up anymore...now, really she didn't seem to mind this (lets not get OCD, now), but when they started leaking all down her chin and made a mess, I decided to move on to a more rigid (my favorites are made my playtex) sippy cup! Now I've gotten rid of these. Only buy if you need a short-time transition and don't plan to use them for very long."
1,This cup is terrible,"I bought a set of 3 ""No Spill"" Nuby sippy cups when my son first started drinking from cups. We lost 1, and broke 1. So I went to buy some more. The only ones available were the Luv n Care cups. I liked the Nuby cups and just figured they had redesigned them, which was a bit disappointing. These cups suck. The handles come off pretty easily, especially if dropped. If dropped too many times, the handles break and then they won't stay on at all. The lids are difficult to get on correctly, so they don't leak, and the actual plastic the cups are made out of is thinner...looks cheap. Don't buy this sippy cup if you have other options. I would buy the Nuby ""No Spill"" sippy cup. It's strong, sturdy and has the exact same nipple; it's just a better cup."
2,LEAKY,"I liked this cup at first, but then it started leaking from the bottom. Evidently, over time, the plastic holders start pulling away from the actual bottle, creating a leak where they were once joined. At least we got about 4-5 months out of it first... Unless you want a ""disposable"" sippy cup, spend your money on a different product."
5,Great Product,Simple Green is great for all types of cleaning projects around the house and works great on many car projects. I have used it for many years and love it.
2,Rain sound on all tracks,"Well, the title indeed says 'rain' and that's all the nature sound there is. Whoever the pianist is, is doing a good job."
2,Not worth it,"I recommend buying a camera bag instead. When I removed the case and started to take picture, I found it cumbersome as I have to hold on to the case. Save the money for the bag."
3,Rebel EOS Case (Loose Fit),"I am used to the old 35mm cases, so I was not happy with the loose way it fits on the camera and the velcro on the back.I also was not happy that I had to take the case totally off to access the memory card or battery. But yes it does protect the camera and that is why I purchsed it. I would recomend that they make the case a bit tighter to fit around the camera, and if they are going to use velcro to use it to access the memory card on the side."
3,protects but not perfect,Needed a bag just to carry my Canon Rebel XTI in without having to tote my bigger bag. This is the only one I could find for that purpose. Years ago bought a case for my faithful old Canon AE1 that I could flip off in a second and let hang to shoot and then put it back on in a second. This is not the case with the EH-18L. It's cumbersome to remove and put back on. Better than nothing but it could have been made easier.
4,Good protection,"I think it's quite stylish and provides good protection to my Canon XTi. The only thing is, it's made of plastic. Not sure if it worth $50+. However, since this is the only semi-hard case I found for my camera, it becomes the only choice. Overall, it's durable enough for weekend use, and it's nice looking. If you need to access to the camera multiple times daily, you might need something leather made or sturdier."
4,LuisAmesty,El producto es muy bueno.Solo resulta un poco incomodo a la hora de ponerlo a la cámara.Te toma mas tiempo de lo que yo desearía
3,Just simple case,"I bought this case for my new EOS camera. The regular shipping was fast and without problem. What I was missing in the box was something like as manual... There is just a box and in the box this simple case...It is piece of ""fake leather"".I was really disapointed. For that much money, I expected something better...Then I tried my camera in. There is a piece you connect to the bottom of your camera... It is good and protects your cam... Then you put this to the case and close it. (like as on the picture) There is special soft fleece for your display... That's nice. Putting in and out the camera is little bit hard. I expected something easy...now, I like it... It is different than on the original picture... It is weird... But you will like it after while....maybe..."
2,Canon Rebel XT camera case,"Difficult to use, and impossible to use with accessory flash. Must remove completely, including screw-in at bottom of camera base, to re-charge camera battery or remove flash card. Wound up leaving it off most of the time."
2,Rebel Case,"I purchased two of the camera cases for the Canon Rebel XT. The leather was stiff and the way the case opened made it difficult to handle. Since I gave these as gifts, noone was brave enough to say ""send it back"". I would have if I could have, as they were not cheap."
2,Case didn't fit properly,The Canon semi-hard case is big around the lens area for my Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi camera. I feel the case needs to fit better all around since it is made for Rebel XTi. I am disappointed.
2,Not very versatile,"Bought this case along with a Digital Rebel XTi, my first SLR. Instead of the 18-55mm kit lens I opted for the Sigma 17-70mm lens. Sad to say, but the case fits only with the kit lens.. The Rebel XTi with the 17-70mm lens barely fits.So a word of cuation to everyone, if you're planning on anything other than the kit lens, then don't get this."
3,Too much limitation to the camera,"A case such as this severely limits a major advantage of any SLR camera such as the rebel XT. Switching lenses is one of the most important aspects of using a SLR camera. The kit lens for the XT is adaquate but is a far cry from realizing the true potential of the camera. This case only fitting the XT with kit lense or a shorter lense effectively reduces the usefulness of the camera. So if you care about realizing the full potential of a SLR's inter-changable lense feature, you're much better off with a photo gear bag than a case like this. Especially for the price of this item..."
3,too small for EF 28-135mm lens,"The available descriptions do not say which lenses will fit inside. I bought it and found that the Canon EF 28-135mm IS USM lens does not fit in this case, however the Sigma 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 fit in it snugly, with the included hood."
