3,"Ok,toddler fell out and got stuck in it","We just set this up for our almost 2 year old. It was pretty easy to set up, but kind of hard to get the anchor to stay firmly. The rail often slides out a bit and we find ourselves pushing it back in. On her 4th night we all of a sudden heard crying and our daughter had fallen into the rail, it pushed out, and she was stuck on it dangling above the floor. She didn't hit the floor, but being half asleep and trapped on this contraption was definitely a bit scary for her. We'll try to tighten it even more, but it seems to slide out from under the mattress more than we expected. We set the bed up low, so we can't fold the rail down, it hits the floor, but she seems to like it kept up anyway. She climbs in at the far end of the bed where the rail is not set up. It is ok for the money and seems to do the trick usually. Hopefully she'll get used to the bed and we can remove the rail."
3,"Good quality, but doesn't work without a box spring","I purchased this bed rail after reading that it is a universal bed rail and doesn't need to be used with a box spring. I thought it would be perfect for using with our son's twin mattress that is on a bunkie board. Unfortunately, it did not work and I had to return it. So although it appears durable and sturdy I only gave it 3 stars since it didn't meet its description of being able to work without a box spring."
2,broken,"This product broke and is unusable after one use, unfortunately we did not realize it was broken until we went to use it the second time (on vacation) and now we are long out of our return period."
5,Safety Plus,"This is a wonderful produce and very easy to set up. Makes a Grandmother feel better at night, knowing her granddaughter won't fall out of bed. Also love the fold down feature, makes making the bed much easier. I would recommend this item highly."
4,Good Product,"I ordered two of these bed rails for my grandson one for each side of his bed,very easy assembly,less than 15 min for both. His bed has a bunkie board that sit down within the bed frame and because of the bulkiness of the hinges on the guard rail we could not utilize both guards rails,because the mattress would not fit with both rails in place. We ended up having to push the beds against the wall,which is what I trying to avoid by ordering two,but it work great with just one,its secure,sturdy and the fold down feature is great for easy bed making. The box spring mattress would allows us to use both rails,because the thickness of the mattress would raise it above the frame. I was pleasantly surprise not to disappointed."
4,Only one flaw,"In general we are pleased with the bed rail we purchased for a twin bed for our grandson to use. It was a little confusing to install at first but once we got the instructions straight in our head it wasn't bad. It seems to be of high quality and very sturdy. Our only problem is that when we want to drop the side down, the rail is taller then the distance to the floor from between the mattress and box spring so it leans instead of dropping straight down. We only use the bed for our grandson so we leave the side up. I would probably buy another and may eventually purchase the companion for the other side of the bed. The price was much less than others we looked at so we were happy with that aspect."
3,Not as snug as I'd like.,I bought this to co sleep and having a shorter bed the fold down doesn't work. It also separates from the bed quite often. Will prevent falls though.
3,Good for price,"I am happy with this bed rail. It looks nice on the bed and is attached well, so I know it isn't going to fall off the bed, even with some pressure applied. The only bad aspect is that the top is a little wobbly, but that might be the case with any bed rail (this is the only one I looked at) and, as I said, the concern isn't such that it would fall off. Great price!"
5,Simple to use and durable,"It took about 10 minutes to assemble and then 20 minutes to setup with adjusting it to the bed. I did this by myself, but probably could have been faster with two people. Our daughter sleeps in a full size bed and has woken up many times against it.The bed is slightly raised which worked out well as that allowed the rail to fold down flat and not jut out from the bed.So far we've had it for ~3 months and it's shown no signs of wear. My daughter has leaned on it while standing in bed and it did not give a little."
3,"Gets in the way of the bed sheets, but sturdy, easy to put together","Looks, feels, and handles good. Only 1 issue, changing the bed with this devise is very challenging, and because of that I just must give it a 3 stars. But it does do what its suppose to do, but not above and beyond."
5,A good bed rail,We love this bed rail. It's very easy to set up. Now I don't need to worry that my daughter might fall off the bed.
4,safety first,"I have only used the product once for my grandson. It is a safe folding side bed rail and that is the priority, but like some of the other reviews say, it hits the floor when folded down. The bed we have him in is a single bed with a normal height frame. It seems a little silly to raise the bed for a two year old. Taller frame or a taller box spring it would fold down all the way."
3,Not for use on a crib,"This product may work great for a bed, but I didn't realize that it is not for a crib! There was nothing wrong with the product, I just wish I knew it wasn't for use on a crib."
1,dangerous,"It light of the recent banning of drop side crips, I feel that this bed rail should also be outlawed. With even the slightest pressure, the rail leans outward creating an alarming gap between the rail and the side of the bed. My toddler would roll toward the rail and immediately fall into this gap, requiring my assistance to dislodge her. It didn't take long for me to realize what a danger this rail creates. Please don't purchase this bed rail."
4,Good for co-sleeping,"I use this because my 3 month old sleeps in our queen size bed with us. It gives us more usable room because one of us can sleep right up close to the edge. It works well, installs easily, and most importantly, fits really tightly against the mattress, so it is appropriate for use with an infant. It is, however, sometimes difficult to get it to lock back into the upright position."
4,with a few adjustments this is great for co-sleeping,"I bought this for co-sleeping with my daughter (she sleeps in a co-sleeping ""nest"" bed in the middle of our bed but I pull her out of that to feed her). This product makes it much easier for me to feed her in bed safely even when she's feeding on the side closest to the edge of the bed. One important adjustment I made is to stuff rolled up towels in the space between the bed and the rail so that my daughter would not get caught in that potentially dangerous spot. Fits well on a queen size bed."
4,"Great bed rail, but not for a convertible crib/toddler bed","This bed rail is great for a larger bed, but is not for use with a convertible crib/toddler bed. I'll use it when our toddler is in a bigger bed, but will be ordering a different rail for use with her current bed."
4,sturdy bed rail,"This worked out well for our 3 year old grandson at Christmas. Easy to assemble and store when we don't need it. It's very sturdy and could work for an adult, too."
5,great product!,"this bed rail is so sturdy and easy to install. my two year old daughter can lean up on it, and even shake it a little, and it doesn't budge. we are very impressed with the quality and happy with the product! and it works just fine with our platform, trundle bed."
4,Would recommend this product,Product was everything I expected. It arrived very quickly. As in other reviews you do need to use the extra bar even if mattress is not one of the extra tall ones.I use this when my grandkids sleep over and it has worked out fine. I would recommend this product
4,Useful product,Easy to assemble and keeps our toddler from falling off the bed while sleeping. Recommend this product to parents because it is easy to assemble and light weight.
2,Mesh is not durable,"The mesh is very flimsy on this product. Our son has put several holes in the mesh w/in weeks of installing it. One of the holes is large enough for him to crawl through it. Needless to say, we are in the market for a new bedrail and hope to find one that is more durable."
4,Pretty good,"These worked pretty well for my son. I just set them up on one side of his bed, as the other side was against the wall. He never did fall out of bed while they were up. We never folded them down, so I can't comment on that function.My only complaint, and the reason for docking one star, is that I thought it was kind of hard to set up. I had a really hard time getting the strap tightened on the opposite side of the mattress. I would tighten it as much as I could, but it would still have too much slack, such that the rail would slip around. I finally realized that I needed to lift up the mattress, over-tighten the strap by a few inches, replace the mattress, and then pull the thing into place. That made it fit snuggly. Even then, after a few months it had loosened, and I had to re-adjust the strap.He finally graduated from bed-rails, so this came off just the other day, after about a year of use."
3,Great but doesn't last long,"This railing was helpful for us, and I would buy another because the price is good, but in less than a year, it started bending outward--my daughter likes to sit up in bed and push against it-- so there is a big space between the bottom and the bed that I don't feel is very safe."
2,Returned it...,"I bought this for when we transitioned my daughter from her crib to a twin mattress. I returned it after trying to make it work for a few weeks. No matter what we tried, we could not get the rail to fit snug enough to the bed... there was always a gap. The metal bar that goes across through the middle pushes against the mattress and creates a gap. We always had to stuff the gap with blankets and even then I felt that it was hazardous if my daughter were to get stuck between the mattress and this bed rail. It got to the point that my husband and I both thought that it would be safer for her to fall out of the bed than to get stuck at night inbetween the mattress and bed rail. We returned it and haven't missed it, she did fine with just putting a row of pillows along the edge of the bed... thankful for the free return, but wish I saved myself the trouble and just used pillows in the first place."
4,Great product,"I found this product to be an asset when it came time for my wife to nurse our baby in our bed. This device folds up easily and although I would'nt leave our baby unattended in the bed, it does the job when an adult is present such as for our use."
2,Not very satisfied,"Don't buy this if you have a pillow top mattress! It only ends up coming about an inch or so higher than the bed. It certainly doesn't look like it would keep your child from rolling off. And maybe its just our mattress but it doesn't even seem to be tight enough to the bed to be safe. For example, it may prevent your child from hitting the floor but they would probably end up between the rail and mattress. If you even gently push on the rail a large space opens up between it and the bed. I now have to return this product and wouldn't recommend it."
5,Great,Works great. Our daughter sleeps with us and she is rolling over now so I needed something that protected her from rolling out of the bed and onto the floor. This is great! I love that it folds down so it doesn't always have to be up.
1,dissapointed with this book,"after reading the other books in this new Blaze series i was bitterly dissapointed with this book, i had read the prequel of this story in midnight pleasures and that story dealt with the sister of the main character in this book, but this series promised us a more sensual and sexy stories, and they accomplished it with the other titles out this month , bu tis story was nice and ok but not at all hot or steamy. the story was to far fetched and it all happened in 1 day it was just to much to fast and not sexy at all, if your buy a book from this new series the best out this month are ""notorius"" by vickie lewis tompson and""going for it"" from jo Leigh this are HOT and Steamy and worth the new title ""blaze""."
3,Get back your old band,"Been a Gary Moore fan since ""The End of the World"" days back in the early 80's. Have collected every album/cd since and have never been let down until this CD. Gary is still great and the songs will survive if played live and not off of some soundboard or whatever that repetitive annoying snapping sound is on the majority of the songs. Surrender is the only song I care to listen to. This CD sound like a TV show that has a laugh track rather than a live studio audience. I give the 3 stars rating only out of respect for Mr. Moore. But please, get back to live rock and roll or the blues, and drop the disco-ish sound."
1,"Why, Gary?","I've been listening to GM since 1982 and enjoyed every single album and had them all, even the blues albums( Usually I do not like blues) and Gary was really not so good at it. This is the worst one,I could not believe that this was Gary. No voice,no music, not even his guitar was playing good.I consider him one of the best guitarists. This album is very different from the previous. I was sad for the level he reached.I listened to this album about six times trying to convince my self to like it, but I could not."
2,Not the greatest construction,"Bought a pair a pair of these to use as high tweeters, crossed over at 5Khz After 3 gigs, the voice coil of one came unglued from the diaphragm. They were being run well within power and frequency specs. There was no sign of damage to the coil or the diaphragm, the glue joint just failed. No replacement diaphragm is available, so I just have to buy another entire unit."
2,pyle pds342 1.35,the tweeter was working fine i had it on for a couple of hours for about a week and it just stop working
1,Buyer beware,"The included printed documentation says these devices ""are warranted to be free of defects in material and workmanship for two (2) years from the date of purchase."" I bought them on 7/1/2010. Both these devices quit working within hours of each other on 6/28/12. I contacted the Pyle Service center's Consumer Return Hotline number for a Return Authorization number as per the limited warranty policy. After being transferred three times, the person I finally talked to told me ""The defective items couldn't be replaced because it had been too long since they were purchased."" When I told him the documentation included with these devices stated the warranty was for two years, he told me ""there was a misprint in the documentation. The warranty was only supposed to be for one year"", and hung up. So.....regardless of what the printed Pyle warranty states, it's nothing but a pile of....buyer beware."
2,It just seemed so superficial,"This books seemed to be based on two assumptions about history writing that are outdated and superficial. The two problems come up right at the begining with Farber's description of new year's eve in 1959 and what the three famous people (Ike, head of catholic church in USA, and MLK) were doing that evening. This book falls into the trap of looking at the sixties independent of its context as well as taking a top down perspective that ignores the local political movements that really move history. He redeems himself slightly with a nod to the fifties and the local activists in the 60's that really led the way to social change but it is too little too late. I have not seen a synthetic view of the 60's that is able to adequately show this overall context as well as give due credit to the underlying social movements. (John Dittmer does do a great job of this for the civil right movement in Mississippi in his book ""Local People"")"
3,The Big Man takes a fall. Yori-kiri!,"Fans of Konishiki will probably like this CD, but most will eagerly await his early retirement from the music industry. Looks like the Big Man got caught with his mawashi down. Better luck next time, Konishiki!"
3,The big man takes a hard fall. Oshi-dashi!,"Konishiki fans will probably like this CD, but anyone not intimate with the world of sumo will probably look forward to Konishiki's early retirement from the music world. Personally, I like it. But then again, I'm a fan of the Big Man. Konishiki ga kita! Nigero!"
3,Heavy-duty?,"If you are looking for hard-core gangster rap, you'll be disappointed. But if you know anything about Konishiki, and his self-effacing personal style, you'll admire this effort. It doesn't break any new musical ground, but all tracks are well produced, and Konishiki does a pretty fair job with the vocals. Most of the tunes are light and catchy, Hawaiian-islands meets reggae, with 100% clean lyrics. And ""Sumo Gansta"" will definitely get your groove on - the biggest beats on the strongest track. From Hawaiian-born Sumo star to Japanese TV regular/commercial star to musician, Konishiki never lets his ego get as big as his 600+ pounds. Give him a listen."
5,Sensational Biography,"Denis Law may be unknown to Americans, but his status in 1960s Britain was as high as Joe Namath's was stateside in the same period. Law was the schoolboy's pin-up in this period, transforming soccer with an aggresive, attacking instinct that thrilled crowds for his club Manchester United. That he later went on to effectively relegate his old club while playing for United's crosstown rivals Manchester City has only added to the Law legend. Brian Hughes book documents a career and a character with few rivals, and explains why a portly middle-aged man is still revered in Manchester as 'The King'."
2,Prose that's proud of itself,"It's taken me a while to get through this book partly because I'm not very excited about the plot and partly because the author's self-conscious writing style really annoys me. There are lovely phrases here and there, but there are plenty of others that read like something you'd find in a greeting card--they try hard to impress and fail. The author makes deliberate, almost constant use of foreshadowing, perhaps in an attempt to get the reader to stick with the book and not lay it down for good. I'm contemplating the latter."
4,Cruel mother,"Lilly is the epitome of a damaged woman whose actions are cruel and who is not even aware of the sorrow she inflicts on her daughters. I read this in a fit of absorption- I just had to know what would happen to Anna and her sisters. Lilly is utterly fascinating and maddening at once. The author is genius at writing about a time and place, with fantastic details. i do think she writes very self-consciously, in hyper poetic prose. I still think this novel is a treasure."
2,One of the Most Boring Books I've read in years.,"I read this book and thought I'd read it before. It is a genre book: misery in the family. On top of that, the book is repetious; the same thing happens again and again. The mother rallies, then falls apart. I always finish a book I start, but now I'm reconsidering that rule."
3,Good Reading,"I enjoyed this book. The story line was easy to follow and the characters were easy to get to know and like/dislike.It makes you stop and wonder just how many kids are surviving in the same dysfuntion the Crane girls grew up in.Great book to take on a plane or read before going to bed, as it's easy to pick up and start again."
3,Beautifully written,"I really enjoyed this book. After starting the book, I didn't think I would like it, but I soon couldn't put it down. The story goes back and forth in time very smoothly, making it even more of a page-turner. The language is beautiful and modern at the same time. The characters are very real and I could relate to each one of them in a different way."
3,House Under Snow~,"House Under Snow is the story of the Crane family, told by the middle daughter Anna. This story is a look at Lilly Crane, the mother, who is leading a life of depression after she loses her husband when he is only 30, and how Lilly attempts to go on with life and raise her three daughters, Ruthie, Anna & Louisa.Unfortunately for Lilly, she can't seem to recover from her husband's death, and thus creates a very dysfunctional home life for her 3 girls. I think Jill Bialosky has true talent as a writer as she succinctly captures the emotions and pains that her characters experience. I think the negative to this book is that all it is about is a huge cycle of dysfunction, which some may find rather depressing and the ending left me somewhat unsatisfied. That aside, it was an easy and entertaining book to read, the writing was well done, and I would certainly read other books by this author."
1,soap opera sentimentality,"This is the sort of book that gives womens' fiction a bad name. It is sentimental and obvious. Overwrought prose and a plot from tv talk shows, this novel lacks intelligence and depth. Never more than an inch above banal, I actually groaned while reading, and not from pleasure."
3,"Ok, but warps easily","I guess I shouldn't have used the dishwasher to clean these as they warp quite a bit. Otherwise, not bad."
5,AAS nursing student,"i had an amazing teacher for medical dosage, and he recommended this book ( the department actually assigned a different book). this book was great, it makes learning fool proof. everything is explained in full, clear detail and makes it for an easy A grade.i'm reviewing it now for a challenge exam to be exempt from a medical dosage class ( since i took it already in another school) and i have no doubt i will ace the test, even without a professor"
3,A sure bet,"On his first visit to a racetrack, straight-laced John Litel innocently places a two-dollar bet and winds up winning ten dollars, a simple act that leads to a full-blown gambling addiction, embezzlement, and associations with seedy con artists. TWO-DOLLAR BETTOR is a preachy, ham-fisted yet entertaining ""problem picture"" from 1951. It's sort of the REEFER MADNESS of gambling movies, although Litel's sympathetic performance helps to smooth over some pretty implausible situations. It may not be a first-place winner, but it's still in the money."
5,John Litel how can you go wrong?,"I'm biased on any John Litel movie, he's a distant cousin. Older movies may have corney actors but John was a legend. One of MGM's biggest bit part actors. To see him in a leading role is always a joy to see."
2,"fun, but doesn't last long","Very fun product, but after three summers it has worn out. At $375, it should last more than three years."
1,DO NOT BUY,My daughter loves this slide. We've had it 2 years - we go to put it up this year and it will not inflate. Evidently has some issues INSIDE under the cover that cannot be repaired. We spent $[...] on this product only to be able to use it for 2 summers. The manufactor basically said it only offers a 60 day warranty. Not much of a deal for $[...] !! I do NOT recommend this product.
4,Great fun!,"This is so much fun. My 10 year old and his friends love it. It does not fit back in the small bag, it comes out of, and if you slide down too fast, you can fall over the edge. Overall, its so much fun. Me as a mom, even slid down it without any problems. If you don't have a pool, this is the way to go. Also, it's very sturdy, and blows up in about 2 minutes or so."
3,"Great fun, but only lasted one summer","My daughters combined and saved their allowance and got this late last summer. It inflates easily, after the initial set-up they could set it up themselves, but sun rot took its toll. We were patching it after 3 months. We stored it indoor over the winter, got it out this spring and the seams have just dissolved. There are too many to patch.Just know going in that while it will be great fun, the sun damage will limit it to one summer."
4,Save gas & enjoy summer in your backyard!,"My 3 y/o son and 6 y/o daughter absolutely love this slide! They play for hours on end while I work in the yard or lay in the chaise and read. Save gas, skip the trips and enjoy summer in your backyard! Smartest $[...] I ever spent . . ."
1,"Very fun, but not durable","I purchased this toy and it lasted only one use. There was a manufacturers defect where the gun attached to the bottom of the slide, where the inner liner was not stitched to the outer liner. After the first time it was used it wouldn't hold air. It wasn't abused as my children are 7 and 9 and only weigh 55 lbs at the most each. I contacted Banzai and they were no help because I didn't save the reciept. I didn't see the need to since all over the box it stated do not return to the store. Overall it was fun for the first time, but a huge disaapointment for the expense."
5,A Huge Hit Over The Holiday,We bought this yesterday and used it all day. We had 6 kids on it for hours. It was a huge hit. It is so much bigger than I thought it would be. It seems to be very durable and the weight limited is 200 pounds so most adults can enjoy it as well. So far I am very pleased with the purchase.
5,Grandchildren enjoyed this slide very much,"I purchased this slide for my grandchildren's birthday since thier birthdays are just a few days apart. They had a blast with the slide. They had friends over for the party, and played all day. They have used it several times this summer, and it really keeps them entertained. We also took it to Vacation Bible School at our church, it was the hit of the event. I would highly rate this water slide to entertain your children."
2,"Great art, but...","...terrible writing! I just read this aloud to my 5-year-old daughter. She liked it well enough, but I was stumbling right and left over the clumsy prose. The story itself is disjointed and borderline absurd. It purports to take place in Australia, Japan, and England, though none of these locales nor their inhabitants feels the least bit authentic, and the faux-Japanese ""thrump-o-moto-mini-moto"" wizard phrases are simply cloying.George Sharp's paintings are imaginative and often luscious, but nowhere do they match his exhilarating work for Joy Chant's *The High Kings*, which preceded the publication of this book by three years and whose writing offers MUCH more for young and adult intellects and imaginations to savor (though it's not for five-year-olds!)."
5,Tenned,"If you like real country music !! not that sissy stuff they play on the radio then Buy this CD.. Its real country at its best,,,"
4,best country singer,Any Jamey Johnson cd rules. He is one of the only ones left that sings great country music. Great outlaw country.
3,JJ,"Because of ""Colors"" I bought both Jamie Johnsons stuff. He can do southern rock stuff like ""Ray Rays Juke Joint"" and ""Redneck Side of Me"" (from the first CD) and thats all I need to hear. The rest is standard soft rock radio fare. Travis Tritt made the same mistake by not rockin it more like Toby Keith does. I like it hard, fast,loud,twangin & no girly stuff; but thats just me. Dude hits it from low down."
5,*** What Country Used To Be ***,"In the land of hybrid-pop-rock-sexvertisment ""country"" today, Jamey and others like him (Ryan Bingham) prove they still have an authentic connection to true country roots. Support him - buy his stuff."
4,Slow Down and Listen ...,"I admit that this can be rather difficult music to enter. But I would say that it is absolutely impossible to ""get the basic idea"" of this piece after 30 seconds, as an earlier reviewer stated. This music requires time to reveal itself. Furthermore, the piece is in a constant state of transformation--and so is the listener. That said, the recording quality doesn't help much; the drums are all but inaudible and the blend of strings and voices is less than ideal. Also, when comparing this recording to others I have heard by this group of musicians, I find the performance to be somewhat less convincing. Hard to say why. Perhaps the stars were a bit out of alignment? Give the piece time, though. It's worth it.Peacejr"
2,Leather carrying case doesn't fit t619 correctly,"The carrying case is inappropriate for t619. Just a warning. The sides that hold it together cover the bottom of the volume button. Also, the hole at the bottom to speak into doesn't actually match where the hole is on the phone. Finally, it appears there is no way you could use the camera with this thing, although I have to admit I didn't even get that far.However, this might still be worth the price for an extra ear piece (which already comes with the phone) and the car charger, which is not much cheaper on its own."
5,Masterful performances,"The Rózsa violin concerto is one of my favorite pieces and this is, beyond all doubt, the best recorded performance of this far-too-neglected work. I do have one quibble with Maestro Heifitz's performance: he rushes the central theme of the middle movement a bit; I would love to have heard him ""sing"" it a bit more, at a slighltly slower tempo -- a bit more tenderness and longing -- because it is such a moving melody.The other pieces on this disc are also wonderful, especially the Korngold. I respectefully disagree with the earlier reviewer about the Korngold being too cliché and corny, but as the old Romans said, ""De gustibus non disputandum est.""If you are a Heifitz fan, or these three great masters of film music, you can't go wrong with this CD."
1,leaks after one use then I was charged restocking fee for return. Why they cannot resell it!,Love the weight and ease of use. I was replacing a hose I had used for 30 years. First time used today and it blew a hole and is now useless. I will return and see if I can obtain a refund. If nothing else it should have lasted one summer season. Expensive at that and then I was charged a restocking fee! And UPS? Why it could not be resold and leaking not my fault! Thoroughly disgusted.
2,Works but keep the water pressure down,"I love the compact case for my RV. If you are not VERY attention and allow higher pressure to be used, this hose starts splitting along the seam, starting with pin holes and eventually lots of seam failure holes. I am buying another one, because it is approved for drinking water, but if I found one that fixed the seam problems, I would jump ship."
4,At last a lead free hose!,"Purchased this hose to fill my kids pool without any lead compounds in the hose to leach into pool water. It seems most conventional garden hoses have a lead warning because of the materials used in them. The Handi-Hose does not.Also hose can be rolled up provided you drain all the water out first, Thanks Handi-Hose.Update / July 21st hose is sprining leaks around faucet connection area. The material seems to be getting pin hole leaks at the last foot of hose closest to connection.Thought I had a winner this is clearly unacceptable.Keep hunting for a lead free hose!"
5,Perfect hose,I purchased this hose because I have 16 doggies and in Michigan.I have a bad shoulder and knee and hauling water in the winter is not gonna work for me. It works so good I ordered 2 more....
5,A Marvelous Novel,"What a marvelous book - I couldn't put it down! The setting is the court of Louis XIV, and is full of intrigue and political machinations. There is rich detail of life at court - from a very unique perspective. The characters are wonderful and all are beautifully and fully developed. There is great wit and humor, but also heartbreaking poignancy. I highly recommend it - it is a thoroughly enjoyable read. I hope Mr. Weidner continues to produce work like this."
3,"Wonderful orchestral execution, but Ormandy is at low voltage","To be fair, when Eugene Ormandy made this rather low-key reading of The Planets, the work hadn't emerged as the sonic blockbuster it is now. Karajan was the first conductor to astonish listeners by the barbaric impact of Mars, a feat that far outstrips Ormandy's mild god of war. However, there's no denying the ravishing beauty of the orchestral work; the classic Boult recording on EMI is put into the shade. With Venus and Neptune sounding this ethereal, it's a shame that Mercury isn't fleet-footed and Jupiter a lot more jovial.The fillers are generous, a Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis, in which the velvety string sound of the Philadelphians comes through with seductive sweetness, but not much rhythmic bite. The familiar Greensleeves is even less rhythmic, but the sounds continue to pour forth voluptuously."
5,absolute winner,"My copy is spattered with ingredients from front to back. There is not a loser recipe in the bunch. Illustrations scattered throughout inspire you to try new and old favorites. The recipe format is easy to read and directions are clear and simple. I especially like that there are international recipes included. The Italian wine cookies, the cinnamon bars and Kentucky bourbon bars are always on my Christmas cookie platter. I have many cookbooks and Christmas magazines with recipes but I could chuck them all in favor of this one little gem of a cookbook."
1,Sized for a 10 yr old!,"I got this shirt because it was different and fun. It's an XL, and I normally take a L, but wanted bigger in case it shrank. Well, it fits like a M. I cannot wear it. I am really disappointed."
5,Works surprisingly well,"Well...I wanted to try something without phosphates since I cant find anything in the regular stores...so gave this a shot. After several uses...I am totally happy. I am not absolutely certain as I could just have a kick butt dishwasher since i had never used it. No residues...everything comes out very clean. A little goes a long way....a tablespoon...1/2 in pre, 1/2 in regular. This oughta last a year....not cheap though. But, by the time you average it out...its good for the money."
2,Powder Everywhere,"Bi-O-Kleen leaves powder all over the dishes. We've tried using less, using more, adding all of it to the bottom of the dishwasher (not the cups), putting half in the cup and half out, all in. . . .nothing works. The powder is still there. I like the scent of the product, but we've had better luck with Ecover tablets."
2,Good but not great.,"Good for the Earth right? So-so for dishes though. Use it for handsoap, like borax, and it works even better! Like the bac-out from this brand as well - smells good."
5,Great for Christmas and all year!,"This is one of those cookbooks that you really just can't put down. One of these days, I've threatened to start at the beginning of this book and just cook everything until I get to the end! It's quite captivating and the recipes, wow, they're outstanding! I've made so many of them and the reviews, well, there's never any leftovers if that says anything! Southern Living has outstanding cookbooks and this one is just over the top. Highly, highly recommend!"
3,"Half of them good, half I'll never make.","This book had a lot of individual recipes that I really liked but the rest I don't think I'll bother with. The book is made up of menus so you pretty much have to pick and choose and make up your own menu as you go along. Great pictures though, really puts you in the mood for the holidays."
1,Garbage,"Pigface is purely a tool for Martin Atkins to name-drop other artists that are more successful than him while exploiting them for his own financial benefit. I doubt any one besides Martin Atkins has seen a penny from Pigface sales, do not buy anything from this guy, he is not worthy of your hard earned money."
2,A better title would be how NOT to cook indian food,"I purchased this book with the hope of cooking vegetarian dishes similar to those I enjoy in good Indian restaurants. I gave it several tries with a variety of recipes, but only ended up with barely edible dishes at best. The flavors were not deep, rich and complex as one expects with proper Indian food, but rather harsh and uninspiring. Perhaps this is because the dishes are Vedic (no garlic, onions, mushrooms etc...)I don't know, but I've since purchased a book by Jaffrey and am so much happier."
2,Not impressed by Yamuna Devi,"I haven't read this new book but was very disappointed with ""Lord Krishna's Cuisine."" Recipes seemed uninteresting compared to Julie Sahni or Madhur Joffrey, and every page drips with admiration for the guru for whom she cooked. She was a Jewish college student from Seattle when she took up with him--not that that means that the recipes aren't authentic, but they may be coming from a different perspective."
4,As good as the first installment.,"Very good program for anyone who is in local or city government, pastors, Sunday School teachers or Christian leaders. Powerful stories of how cities can be transformed through the efforts of those who are willing to set aside their demonational differences and personal differences and work together."
2,DVD Scratched,"This DVD was advertised as ""used but in great shape"". Actually is was very scratched, and therefore not worth the high price I paid."
2,Disappointed,If I knew that it was an iron on patch I would not have bought it. Already peeling off after 2 washes.
2,Disappointing,"I wanted a remote to control iTunes and DVDs. Had to switch from PowerDVD to Windows Media to get DVD control, which meant finding and downloading a patch to get DVDs to work in Windows Media. I have not really tested the range so I can't comment on that, but the functionality is disappointing. In both iTunes and Windows Media the buttons do things that aren't what they say-in iTunes volume down turns the volume up, mute turns the volume down, and there is nothing that actually mutes. Had to experiment to figure out where the functions I wanted were, and many are missing (even though there are clearly buttons for the purpose. Yeah, it slides into your PC card slot, but I find that's mostly where it stays-doesn't work well enough to take it out and use it. I found it extremely frustrating and wish I had bought something big and clunky and cheap instead. Maybe I just got a crappy one, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it."
2,Does not work with Windows Media Player 11,"Very easy product to install. Just plug it in, no install software, no options. Small size and arries USB attacthment in the back. RF much better than infrared.It works by appearing to be a keyboard. When you push Pause it sends a control-p to the software, or a different key if you have selected iTunes or the video player.However, there are two problems.1) Microsoft changed the control keys in WMP 11 so it no longer works with that package.2) From time to time any media player will ""lose focus"" when some other window pops up on your computer. The emulated keystrokes now go to the other application and you have to get up and use the mouse to click back in the media playing app.I used it for over a year with the previous version of WMP. The losing focus issues is a hassle, but nothing is perfect. For me, though, not being able to control WMP is a killer."
5,A must purchase,Both these gentlemen have a long history and are very talented. You will not be dissappointed with this CD. If you ever get a chance to see either of them perform it will be time and money well spent.
5,Excelent player and music.,"Jascha Heifetz was known as the best player in the world when he was 13 years old, and was the best ever since. Few players in the world rivaled him, and his closest rivals died before they got the chance to glow. Even though Mr. Heifetz died, he is still reknowned as the best violinist of all time.His left hand is the supreme: not a single violinist can match his speed, accuracy, and clearness. His bowhand is quite simple in terms of technique, however, he turned his simple techniques into complex combinations, producing the most interesting sounds.Conus lived through ""The Golden Age of Films,"" and wrote movie music, as the movie-like tones in the Conus Violin Concerto. Mr. Heifetz premiered it, and changed it a little, causing most devoted teachers, such as Mr. Galamian of Juliard, to teach it that way."
2,Doesn't include all cities in the description,"The description for this map says that it includes ""Area Maps: Korea, Busan Area, Cheju-do, East Coast, Seoul Area; City Maps: Central Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Daejon"", however it does not actually contain maps of Busan, the East Coast, Daegu, nor Daejon."
4,Good for the Money,"For what I paid ($380 including shipping) this is a very good squat machine. My only complaints are that it only supports olympic plates (not the type with the 1"" holes...which I already had), and the ""rubber weight rest"" isn't designed very well and prone to ripping unless you carefully reposition the piece after each use. I was initially worried about the center of gravity being a bit far back (for tipping reasons), but it seems very stable in all situations.My son & I are happy and getting really strong on an ergonomic easy to use machine that's much safer than barbell squatting."
4,All is good except Kabaivanska.,Unfortunately Madame Kabaivanska no have front teeth.. What else can we explain such a horrible pronunciation? Her vibratto.. for an amateur. The orchestra is magnificent! Pavarotti is good.
1,"Poor Quality Item, Stay Away","I was very disappointed to receive this item with the intention of giving it to someone for Christmas. I inflated the football, started to paint on it and it deflated again within 24 hours. I inflated it again, and it kept deflating. Now it's out of stock and I have nothing to give my recipient. Very disappointing."
4,fun project,"My son, age 6, loved this toy for Christmas. He wrote all of his friend's names on the football and his own logo. The football has stayed inflated and continues to be fun. Will buy more as gifts."
3,"A little flimsy, fine for uncarpeted surfaces","It it's very light and works pretty well on hard floors, although I had to duct tape it to keep the plastic screws that hold the handle in place from constantly falling out. On carpet it is 100% A-1 guaranteed completely useless."
5,Great for Pet Hair,I bought this stick vacuum to help control the pet hair from 2 golden retrievers. I have all hardwood floors and so far it has worked great. I have noticed a significant reduction in dog hair and dust on my floors since using this product.
3,Dirty Filter,The vacuum works very well but the filter clogs easily and is extremely difficult to clean.
4,"Well put-together, and fun!","Overall, definitely worth it, even with its few shortcomings.Construction* Easy to put together. Much easier than a similar IKEA bar a friend of mine purchased and had me do.* Has the IKEA-style process, but little add-ons like built-in bolts make it much more sturdy and less likely to fall apart.Surface* Great finish and size!* Stable and does not even hint that games are stored just under the surface. Would have thought it was just a regular bar.Games* Nice felt finish to all the games.* Roulette wheel and craps equipment are a little plastic-ey.* Red is not as bright as I would like it and can be confused with black if you're not paying attention.Storage* Good amount of storage.* Would be nice to have more wine, martini, and margarita glass space. Also would be better if it allowed wider-based glasses to fit in the glass rack.Overall, I'm enjoying it so far."
1,save your money,"I did nothing but struggle with this machine. It was so fussy--it would break pretty much every time I used it. And there was no consistent problem. Sometimes it would freeze up, other times get jammed, other times chew up my fabric. Don't waste your time or money!"
2,Questionable,"In response to: ""Sure, there are favorites missing and novels that anyone might rank higher or lower, but in general it's hard to fault his choices.""I simply don't see how that is the case. The fact that Victor Hugo's 'Les Misérables', for example, is outranked by American high-school literature such as 'Jane Eyre', 'The Awakening, 'The Great Gatsby', 'The Catcher in the Rye' and 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' is somewhat unsettling, at least in my opinion.Burt's top five picks are arguably solid, but the remaining 95 are just plain arbitrary."
1,like looking through a stranger's photo album.,"ugh! if you can get past looking at all these cheesy snapshots of people you've never met, i give you a lot of credit. the worst part is the fact that one girl *constantly* has her long hair draped over the front of the dresses she wears. you couldn't see the detail! what's the point? the dated typography was no less than annoying and the layout completely lacked balance. i couldn't get my money back fast enough."
1,Could have been much better if not nearly illiterate,"This was a fun book to read. Or it might have been. I heard about this book on a talk show interview with Greg Kihn and thought it sounded interesting. When I started to read it, I actually had to put it down and back away for a while. John Darling obviously never passed this literary gem through ANY sort of grammatical or editorial review process. Inappropriate (I mean words that should have been typos, except they happen to accidentally be whole words) word choices and grammatically nonsensical sentences abound. I finally DID complete the book, but only after deciding to ignore spelling, punctuation and a rather scattershot approach. Maybe I just wasn't drunk enough. There is a lot of information here, but I had to question just how much is based in real research as opposed to just browsing the band's website."
5,Great Sound,The Inconvenient Truth in the SOUNDWAVE 360 VERSION played on my MP3 player sounds incredible. I have never experienced this type of sound in my headphones. Everyone has to hear it!
5,News Has To Spread!,"This soundtrack is so incredibly beautiful, word hopefully will spread about it as time goes on. The movie is such a marquee event, that many people do not know about this amazing piece of work. Please, do yourself a favor, get a copy of this thing. I come home often after a busy day and this cd just sets a wonderful mood. Thanks Michael Brook."
3,not ambient,I thought michael Brooks's albums all had a similar feel to his debut album Hybrid. I was way off the mark.
5,Document this!,"Man these cats always have put out some of the best fusion jazz you can buy, there's nothing like a life performance, and Karizma has some of the best fusion Albums Available. So Document this, purchase Document if you love jazz fusion or just really love jazz music."
5,Where did all the real fusion go?,"That is how I felt when I heard this. The playing is amazing by everyone. There is a lot of versatility as well, as they show off their jazz chops on a couple of tunes. This is fusion at its best from a band that has been together for 30+ years."
3,Vinnie's awesome. but....,"Now I am not a drummer and if I was I'd be totally knocked out by Vinnie's unbelivable playing. Its also very impressive that they can do this stuff live.That said, while I think Mike Landau is one of the greats, he's really a rock player and when the chord changes get tricky he's stuck making groaning sounds with the whammy bar. (Which would be way cool in a heavy rock setting but not here). Its like asking Leslie West to play fusion. I'm not sure how he got through Tales From The Buldge but my guess is those solos were worked out in advance.I could have done without some of tinkly electric keyboard stuff which sounds pretty dated, also. Still, they're all great players and Vinnie is in a class by himself. And if you want to hear Michael Landau hit all the right notes (wow!) get Tales From The Buldge."
5,METRA Ltd GDB2 Gold Series Distributions Block,"This distribution block is exactly what I was looking for, and the price was right on target too. For my application, I needed a distribution block for some wiring issues that arose from doing a battery relocation on my race car. This distribution block was the perfect size, accepted the wiring that I had installed, and installed nicely inside my car."
5,"Unique, Attractive, Easy To Read","The uniqueness of this attractive, easy to read book is that other books about world religions are written in either an objective manner in which the reader does not know the religion of the author - or - written in a subjective manner in which the author often ""puts down"" religions other than hers or his. ""HOPE FOR THE WORLD - A Christian Looks At World Religions"" is written from the viewpoint of a Christian who definitely sticks to his guns on being a Christian, but advocates such things as, ""As Christians feel compelled to share the Gospel of Christ, we must also feel compelled to respect and love people of other religious faiths...accepting all humans as precious creations created in God's image."" I responded well to this approach and I think many other people will, too."
2,This is a Christian Book???,"I enjoyed the information on the other religions and it answered my questions that I had. However, I can't believe this book is advertised as a Christian book when the gospel is not brought forward. The book leaves you hanging with the thought that all religions are the same and are all ""good"". However, does not explain that the main difference between Christianity and other religions is that other religions are works based and Christians are faith based. He dips slightly into this when giving the overview of Christianity, but if I were a new or non-believer, I would not come away from this book with a feeling that Christianity is the only way."
4,Track Listing,1. Wonderful Lie2. Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me3. Who's Your Jailer Now?
3,"Good fragrance, poor lotion","I love the fragrance of Cabochard, so I wanted the lotion to go with the fragrance. The fragrance of the lotion is true, but the lotion itself is disappointingly thin. Actually, I'd expected a cream rather than a lotion, but the texture is so thin that it doesn't even have to be squeezed to come out. Wish it were thicker."
2,Biased,"A good book, but too biased toward the Haitians. Given the gulf of economic success between the two, it would have been better if she had taken a harder look at Haiti."
3,Questions?!,"I read this book several months ago. I don't know. I was not particularly enamored with the writing style. The story was more about Dominica, and Haiti seemed to be a sideline story.However, I did gain some insights and it prompted me to read more books about the island, particularly Haitian History. I have learned a lot and have a better understanding of why Dominicans who are obviously the descedents of Africans, will curse you out if you call them black or African. I understand the effectiveness of the Trujillo's campaign to whiten his part of the island through screwing with the minds of the citizens.I also understand why they tend to have some serious hate for Haitians. I am still learning."
1,very elementary,The hairstyles and make-up go on like crayons. It is way overpriced even if it were free. It is useless.
1,Changes Beauty Studio,This program is not nearly as good as Cosmopolian Virtual Makeover. I would like to return it. I wouldn't recommend it.
5,This is an awesome book,"I borrowed this book from my school's library. And it is awesome. John Fischer takes a few lines from a hymn and writes a devotional on it. One for each day of the year. If you love hymns, like I do, this book is worth, at least reading. It's encouraging, and Fischer brings up topics, that I, at least, have never thought about in connection with the hymn for the day. Anyways, if you enjoy hymns, and the heritage,and meaning that they have for our generation, you should read this book."
1,False wattage rating,"using a 200w a side @ 4ohm 50% output power amp. Pop goes both the tweeters after 3 uses. Get what you pay for, more junk."
3,"Mids, not Highs","purchased to replace a crappy blown screw on horn driver in a cheap Nady floor monitor. Way better construction and power handling than the factory component, more spl, but it is *not* a high frequency driver. It is a mid frequency driver. For my application, this will suffice as i need to hear the vocals and music without a lot of high fidelity sound (floor monitor/two way speaker set up), but a bit more highs would be greatly appreciated. in a three way configuration, this driver would more than likely shine!"
3,Wrong Product,"So I purchased this item a bit ago.The shipping as free, and that was nifty.The package arrived before it was due, also nifty.It was in discrete packaging, also nifty.They sent me the 16 feet of Japanese bondage rope instead of the love cuffs.Not complaining, they DID send me the wrong product, but they sent me something better."
5,"contagious, radical, and highly evolved","while the constantly evolving back drop of ""cathedral engine"" (larry thrasher's acoustic ambient score for the album) is no less significant, hollow cost focuses more specifically on the essence of the spoken word."
2,nap-time reading,"This is my first Tamora Pierce book...and probably my last. It starts out great. A shipwreck. A trial. Mysterious weather patterns. And a hopelessly trapped girl. But chapter by chapter the book get more and more boring. The conflict starts to feel tacked on instead of exciting. And I swear that half of this book is about the main characters learning proper meditation techniques. Now I don't need all my fantasy to have epic battle against evil overlords, but I need some conflict. Even what slim inner conflicts the characters have in treated with the depth of a puppet show, and the social interactions are no better.Read the first chapter. Maybe the second. Then stop. There's nothing worth reading after that."
1,Writers are hard to please.,"As a writer and a critical reader, 'Circle of Magic #1 Sandry's Book' by Tamora Pierce was not a very well-thought-out book. Interesting concept sure, but the plotline itself was weak and lacking. There's so much more she could have done with the story, but it was confusing at times, especially the way she tried to describe magical scenes. In my humble opinion the story was poorly devised. I don't know how many times her characters meditated and breathed, meditated and breathed. I would definitely NOT recommend this book."
2,her other books r better...,"i finished this book about 6 hours after i got it, and in all honesty, it really didnt satisfy me much. this is mostly because they seemed slightly childish to me, compared to tamora pierce's other works. i was 13 when i read this book, and i think that this was also a factor. for younger kids this book is excelent. for those 13 and over its just annoying. ifr ur over 13 and this intrested u try 'alanna; the first adventure' instead. if ur 12 or younger go for it, ull probably like it."
2,warning - very occult,"My 9 yr old daughter an I have read Tamora Pierce's books on Tortall, and found them very good. These books were recommended to me also, and since I enjoyed the Alanna series very much, I decided to read these. They aren't as good as the books on Tortall. What's more, although Pierce writes about magic in all of her books, these ones in particular I have found to be quite occult in nature.The occult elements include magic circles, craft magic, and gods/goddesses. The human mages are part of a Temple and practice meditation. Their blessing is tracing a ""gods circle"" on their chests with their fingertips.Just as a warning to parents who like to monitor what their children read, these books could almost be a primer to Pagan/Wiccan rites. Read them before your kids do, or with them... but if you are concerned about the occult, don't let them read these books on their own."
3,Not Exactly what I expected...,"I have read all of Ms. Pierce's books, including the Circle of Magic and the Cirle opens. I read these after Alanna and the Immortals and they were kind of disapointing. These books are very well written and the writing isn't complicated, but I don't think they were quite up to Alanna and The Immortals' standards."
4,best of the series,"I love any book by Tamora Pierce. This series is good and if it was by any other author I would call it great. However, since I have such high expectations for Tamora Pierce I cannot call it truly wonderful."
5,Loved this,"Book was wonderful, really enjoyed the new world Tamora has woven and loved the characters. Only gripe is the title.. in England the books weren't named for the characters, but like this:1. The magic in the Weaving2. The Power in the Storm3. The Fire in the Forging4. The healing in the vine.These sound so much better than Sandy's book, Tris' book and so on."
4,Sandry's Book,"This book is about 4 different kids who come together only by one person. They all have different kinds of magic such as, fire, plant, storm, and weaving. Sandry has the weaving kind of magic. They are all set in for an adventure which they have to work together or else their death will be a down fall. The kids names are, Briar-plant magic, Tris- storm magic, and Daja- metal/fire magic, and I already said Sandry has weaving magic. The reason why I gave it four stars was because it was kind of confusing at times but overall it was good."
4,Good Book,"I thought this was a very good book.The reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it got confusing at times.In the beginning it's hard to follow what each character is doing.If you're reading this book,don't give up it has an awesome ending!"
4,I cant think of a good title. Just read it.,"This is the first book that I read by Tamora Pierce and I loooved it! I finished this quartet and I am eagerly awaiting the next book in The Circle Opens. HOWEVER, the only reason I am giving this FOUR stars instead of five is that the rest of Tamora's series are slightly better. After I finished reading Street Magic, I read Alanna the First Adventure. That was it and I was swept up in the world of Tortall. Song of the Lioness, The Immortals, and Lady Knight are all quartets based in Tortall and I think that those are better BUT the Circle books are great too! GO TAMORA! My friend thinks I'm obsessed but believe me, once you start reading you won't be able to stop."
4,Sandry's Book,"Sandry's Book is the first book in Tamora Pierce's The Circle of Magic series. This book introduces the four main characters of the series: Sandry, who has thread magic, Tris, who has weather magic, Daja, who has metal magic, and Briar, who has plant magic. These four young mages are new to their powers and never knew they existed. When they first meet, they don't get along. But after a while they learn to live with each other. As they learn the basic skills of magic, they also learn more about how to use and controll their powers. Their particularly rare knids of magic are strong, but it is stronger when they are together. When an earthquake threatens their lives, they bind thier magics and learn to work together."
4,A warm and magic story,When I first started reading this book I found it a tad choppy. I'm glad I didn't let that discourage me. The story wove itself into a heartwarming tale that has a lot of room to grow.
4,I like this series,"Read it before at my local library, so I just had to get it for my kindle.I hope to find similar books."
2,Neat and Tidy,"A very precice and neatly written book (not as good as her latest books) and too clean. Not enough rise to the climax, and it needs more twists. I would recommend this book only for preteens with a lot of free time."
5,fantastic!,"i loved this book, as in all tamora pierce books none of the people's carictoristics(sorry about the spelling) where bland and the same as each had their own styles and reactions i have not read the last book the power in the vine,but when i do im sure i will enjoy it as much a the first three."
2,Not as exciting and interesting as Lioness and Immortals,"Sandry's Book was okay. The character development was not the best. I liked Tamora Pierce's other books better, because they were much more exciting and it wasn't ALWAYS OBVIOUS what the characters will do next. So if you haven't read the Song of the Lioness or the Immortals Quartets and you are thinking about reading the Circle of Magic first please STOP!!!!!! Read the other ones first and realize the best that this amazing author can do."
2,Very disappointed,Product did not live up to its claim. Not much power. The line does not auto feed like it should. Serious mowers will want to stay with a gas powered weed eater. Does not cut well around chain link fences. Have to make several passes in same area where small weeds are growing. Would maybe be worth it if you had a 10'x 10' square yard with perfect grass and no weeds. I will be sending mine back.
2,WORX trimmer,"Dissapointing performance, line keeps jamming, probably due to light duty construction. I could have gotten something similar with half the money.I will know better, next time."
1,Buy A Different Brand DO NOT BUY WORX,"This product is probably the worst piece of junk I have ever attempted to use. I ordered a replacement spool, thinking that the factory has some kind of magic that might improve the feeding and lifespan of the string-NOT. The string breaks every 3-5 seconds and you have to take the spool out and rethread through two openings! What a time consumer. It took me 1.5 hours to edge a tiny lawn that should have taken 15 minutes. The edger does not work for the same reasons. I cannot believe I paid $100 for this junk. Not to mention the fact no retailer carries any replacement spools and/or string for this product.DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK"
1,Worx 12-Inch dual line trimmer,"I purchased this product several months ago and had open heart surgery before I could use it. I've been going through weeks of rehab and finally got the ok to do yard work again. I got the Worx trimmer out and used it for the first time yesterday. I have never been so disappointed in a purchase before. The line is too thin, and it breaks about every ten seconds. Then you have to take it apart and re-string it and that is very difficult compared to my old Robi gas powered trimmer. I am at the point of getting rid of the machine because I feel it is not engineered properly for general use."
2,Ineffective Performance,"I purchased Worx Trimmer #WG102 purposely for edging and to replace my old one. At my surprise, both lines spilled out from spool at first try. I thought the line was not long enough as stated on the manual so I ordered 2 additional pre-wound spools hoping the problem will be resolved. Worx Trimmer #WG102 performance was very disappointing because contrary to auto feed, I had to manually feed the line less than a minute of its usage. Through frustration, I stopped edging with Worx Trimmer #WG102 all together and my aging TORO became handy for now. Worx Corp needs to review and or reengineer Worx's spools for the machine to do well on the market."
1,Line kept breaking and wouldn't automatically feed.,"During the short periods of time the Trimmer worked it was better than any Edger/Trimmer I've ever owned; but, the line kept breaking and it would not feed so I had to manually manipulate the unit and feed new line. It was just too much of a hassle so I returned the unit."
1,doesnt work as advertised,"great commercial, but product sucks. it doesnt auto feed, i have to stop and rethread the string or the string just shoots right out everytime. it takes me 2 hours to edge my lawn."
2,Worx Not User Friendly,"The user instructions are completely useless. I thought I was purchasing the Worx rechargeable Trimmer. Boy, did I get a surprise and now there are minimal instructions for puting my purchase to use."
4,"Awesome sound, great image, some minor sync issues.","I was afraid of getting bad to average video or sound on this product since this DVD is made from a recording of the mid 80s, and some leaked videos on youtube not giving a good image of it. Yet, to my surprise, the image is very good and the sound is perfect (2.0 or 5.1 alike). The only issue I have (checked on 2 different DVD player : my PC's and my PS3 system), there are some very short passages (only a few) where the image and sound are not sync (I'm a cello player and can tell the bow & fingering don't match what I hear, image is getting out of sync). I really hope this is not a defect of the DVDs itself but rather a problem with my DVD player systems.I really recommend this product anyway."

3,jacqui,"I like that it's relatively inexpensive and easy to learn, but you can't adjust the bobbin tension, and mine is too loose. I have to take it in to be adusted. How's that for convenience?"
1,"Simple to use, but difficult to fix a problem.","Though I am not a novice at this sort of stuff, I bought this because it was very basic and user friendly. It is easy to use in regards to setting up and threading etc. But I can't seem to get the tension right. I have tried every stabilizer and thread tension, but it never comes out right. I've tried it on T-shirt material because I thought this would be the easiest and I still can't get it to embroider properly. I can't get any help from the company. This machine has been sitting at my house for 5 months and not one shirt came out right! Anyone who can help me, please email me at yjrose712@yahoo.com"
1,"Beware - Not a ""Universal"" Lock","I bought the Trimax ""Universal"" lock only to find it was not universal. When attached to a Brenderup horse trailer's coupler, it would slide off over the front or simply fall off if the coupler lever was raised. The lock seems to require a groove on the top of the coupler to hold the lock's top bar-loop. Else, as on my trailer, it will not stay attached. It seems solid and may work for some trailers, but not for all.Instead, try the Master Lock Universal Trailer Coupler Lock #377DAT; it worked for me and seems as if it will work for all couplers. Also it's $18 with free shipping instead of $36 plus $10 shipping for the Trimax.That said about this product and it's inaccurate billing, I am happy with Mobile Mart who refunded my costs and paid for return shipping the lock."
3,not solid hardened steel,"This is probably an ok lock, but it is not entirely made up of solid hardened steel, making it possible to break, especially in cold weather. However, Amazon was terrific with letting us return the item at their cost, due to the inaccurate description."
3,Trimax UMAX50 trailer Tongue Lock,"This Tongue Lock seems to be well designed, however it did not fit very well on the Dutton - Lainston coupler for a/ 2-5/16"" ball, installed on my 2004 Terry/Fleetwood Travel Trailer. The top security bar does not fit down tight behind the curvature in the coupler where the trailer ball fits. It looks like the coupler lock could be defeated easily with a couple of hard blows from a good sledge hammer. Beware, make sure this coupler lock fits your coupler snug before you purchase it."
3,"Leaves a bit to be desired, but what else is there?","I looked all over the place, sticknbrick stores and on line and could find no other better coupler locks ... but this still is not a deterrent if someone with a crowbar and some leverage really wants the trailer! As they say, it deters those who are looking for a quick steal, not much more. I have a fairly standard coupler on our new travel trailer and when this is installed, there is still room between the bar and the top of the coupler to insert the business end of a good sized pry bar. But still fits tighter than all of the Master locks I've tried and returned.The lock would work better if the 'ball' were specifically sized for the coupler (i.e. 2 5/16"") and an additional 'notch' on the lock bar so it could be seated over the back side of the coupler more snugly."
4,I would buy again...,"Easy to install, seems to be of good quality. Time will be the test as I sent my camper to a public storage for more garage space. I will note if any concerns come up in the future."
3,"solid lock bar, lightweight lock body seems easy to break","as noted in the title, the bar is solid. the lock body is some sort of resin (?) which seems like a good blow with a solid hammer could break apart. The lock mechanism itself is decent and the unit functions just fine. i just don't think it is worth the cost. If buying one again, i would choose a more durable product for the price. It looks solid from a distance and perhaps that serves as a deterrent too."
4,Not as great as I expected,"Although it is a nice collection, it is not the most rhythmic that I have heard. I have bought many of the Putumayo collections, the World in general one, and the Cuba one. This one does not rank as high as the others, but it is a nice collection. There is a lot of PR on it, but it is nto one of my favorite cds. Most of the songs are the same, mostly plena, there is not any salsa, merengue, son, etc..."
1,Don't bother / Ni te molestes.,"The only worthwhile items on this CD are numbers 8, 9, and 11. The rest is an amalgamam of depressing songs, mostly ""pregones"", making it the primal reason this compilation stinks, as Puerto Rican music is usually very upbeat and full of life. I have a feeling that whomever decided on most of these particular songs had a hidden political agenda, as the lyrics have an ""independentista"" double entendre to them.I should have suspected, since the album contains two numbers with Andrés ""El Jíbaro"" Jímenez, a once-promising artist who got too high on his political horse. I guess he must think of himself as the Puerto Rican equivalent of Silvio Rodríguez, ""y realmente no le llega ni a los talones"".Don't waste your money, that is, unless you're into the ""blame the Yankee for every problem in Puerto Rico"" mindset.Oh, and one more thing: ""¡Ni siquiera es bailable!"" Now, isn't that proof enough that it's not an album representative of Puerto Rican music?"
2,PUYUMAYO P.R.= STINKER,I may just not like this music i lived in the Dominican Republic and have visited Puerto Rico and love most latino music but i did not care for this cd.The only 2 song's that are worth playing are track's 9/10.I do have the D.R. cd which is more user friendly then this one ! J.B.
5,happy with product,"I mainly use this for target shooting indoors and they work well. They do not fog up, fit well, and the rubber nose piece keeps them up just fine."
3,"If you have a big head, you might want to look for other products","I don't have a huge head, but I'm also 6'3"" so I'm probably larger than a good portion of the population. I find these glasses to be VERY snug fitting around my head.I do like the tint level, just enough to take the edge off when working outside, and not dark enough to impact your work inside. I chose the indoor/outdoor mirror glasses just for that reason.Quite obvious that these are eye protection only, and won't do anything for side coverage if you're trying to keep dust or other contaminants out of your eyes working in a place like an attic, etc."
4,Right product for the right price,"Looks good, wears comfortably, and does its job. For less than $10, I really can't complain. I took them to an indoor range and I forgot I was wearing them after a few minutes. This tells me I didn't have to keep adjusting them for comfort nor wipe the fog from the lenses. Quality product and a great price."
5,Just what I needed.,"Cheap and effective. No sense in buying something for 30 or 40 bucks. For just a few bucks these things work fine. Take them shooting with me, havent had a problem yet. They have my vote."
3,Good quality but very long ear pieces,"I like how the look and fit.Two problems I have with them:1.The earpieces are way longer then needed, and are squeezing my head but do not provide enough traction to stop glasses from sliding if I look down.2. The plastic bar holding glasses on top is too wide and covers field of vision too much for me it I look to the top.The same plastic on top provides great circulation so when glasses fog up (and the frequently do when I am not moving) as soon as I start to move - they clear up.I am using them for short track speed-skating (and because of the field of view limitations I would probably have to get another onceAnd for motorcycle - where they are ok - but slip too much"
2,One pretty big design flaw with these...,"If you wear plugs, this would never come up...but if you wear muffs, electronic or otherwise, the temples of these are wide and interfere with the seal between the hearing protection and the head. When I'm at the indoor range, I like to wear both plugs and muffs...these cut the effectiveness of the muffs by a level I am uncomfortable with. These will be outdoor use only with long guns."
5,Great Product at a Great Price,Great product at a great price! What isn't to like? Protects your eyes and fits comfortably with my ear protection.
2,they fog up....,wanted a sleek pair of goggles so that didn't fog up when I worse them....these are no better than the rest
2,"Calling this an ""Assembly"" Book is False Advertising","I'm on a quest for a good book about assembly. I teach reverse engineering classes and many of my students ask what the best way to learn assembly is. Some day a decent book on Intel Assembly will be written, but that day is not today. Skip this book if you want to do anything mildly resembling real-world assembly. Paul Carter has a much better assembly book that is freely available for download. (Google ""Paul Carter"")I think this book would be much more appropriate if it was titled ""The Art of High Level Assembly."" The current title borders on false advertising."
2,Not what you would expect.,"I am familiar with writing true assembly language programs for microcontrollers. Granted, while they are very different than PC processors, the fact is that HLA leaves something to be desired. It may have the power of assembly, but it doesn't have the feel. It should have been titled 'The Art of HLA' which would have still sounded good, but would have also given the customer a hint about what is inside the book. I'm going to keep it, but I'm not happy with the product.True assembly is beautiful with respect to form, as there is little abstraction between you and the machine. This way there is no incongruencies between what you want it to do and how you say you want it done."
3,Who is this for?,"I grabbed this book looking for some interesting tidbits. I know a few RISC architectures asm, but never played w/x86, which is what I saw in the flipping through the book. Turns out I didn't flip through it nearly as much as I should have before buying it.I didn't notice the whole book being geared towards a pseudo-assembly called HLA. High Level Assembly. Looks like x86, but isn't quite. Ok, my fault. So I read on and get a book using a teaching format I personally HATE. The ""teach the wrong, but easy way first"" then ""teach the more correct way later and hope the reader doesn't remember the wrong way"" approach. Ugh.I'm not sure I would recommend this book to anyone. It's expensive and huge, when there are other more compact tomes to learn assembly from."
2,Not Assembly Language,"I am disappointed that this book doesn't even talk about assembly language. The author has clearly created his own high level wrapper of the language itself and calls it ""High Level Assembly"", which looks like a mix of assembly, C, and Pascal. The author states that HLA makes assembly easier to learn and it is intended for beginners learning the basics of programming or people coming from a high-level language and going down to a lower one. But why would a beginner start from assembly? And why would a high-level programmer waste time reading a 800+ page book and just get a ""preview"" of assembly?The book, however, is well-crafted and the author claiming it was developed over a decade or so is definitely true. It is well structured, but the CD contents look like it's put together a bit hastily. I recommend just going to the author's web site as it's more up to date with the latest version of the programs."
3,An o.k. later-era album,"Another Mick Harris solo effort under the Scorn banner, this album doesn't vary much from the style he once chose with ""Gyral"". Mick is still one of the best drummers ever, but in the late '90s his work missed inspiration and energy. For those who don't own any Scorn album yet, ""Zander"" is a good first purchase. For the others, especially for those who have already listened to ""Evanescence"", ""White Irises Blind"" and ""Logghi Barogghi"", this album could be a rather one-dimensional affair. Mick's rhythm patterns wear thin after a few listens, and this album lacks the vocals/guitars/melodies of early Scorn releases. However, it's still much more interesting than plenty of music coming from today's drum n'bass/ambient house scene. Other recommendable Harris releases in my opinion are:Mick Harris & E. Bernocchi ~ ""Total station"" (4 stars)Equations of Eternity ~ ""Veve"" (4 stars)"
2,Simplicity SA2200,It amazes me that a beautiful sewing machine would have such a major design flaw. The removable sewing arm on this machine is held on by two tiny pieces of plastic. One of which was broken off by the time the machine was delivered. This resulted in the arm not staying on the machine making it impossible to to sew without taping it in place. It is such a nice machine what a shame they did not come up with a better design. Amazon did arrange for UPS to pick it up the very next day which was nice. I am now waiting for my refund so I can purchase another machine.
5,Great Machine!,"I've owned this machine for under a week...and as a beginning sewer, I'm very impressed. Easy to use, easy to understand manual...so far two thumbs up!"
1,Something's Amiss,"We saw this advertised, and thought ""Wow, what a deal...""First machine we received? Timing was off, would NOT sew-- threads would not lock together---- so we returned it.Second machine we received?Halfway thru a seam, the presser foot stopped advancing, stitch length got really small, and fabric kept puckering.In both cases, we spent time on the phone with Simplicity representatives, who eventually said that our machines had to be defective, as they had ""no idea"" why it wasn't working.I'm glad other people have had pleasant experiences...We're going to return the second one, and take a look at other makes/models. This has left a bad taste in our mouth."
2,Not good for buttonholes!,"I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I haven't had a buttonhole work on the first try yet, and I've had the machine for 2 years. It doesn't feed the fabric evenly so one side of the buttonhole may be 1/2 inch and the other side an inch. I just finished having to rip out a buttonhole twice, which prompted me to finally write this review. Now the fabric is so messed up, I'm not sure it will be presentable. I spent MANY hours on this jacket, only to have it be ruined because of this machine."
5,Best Buy / Excellent Product,"Wow! I received my sewing machine and am in complete awe at the price and quality of this machine. I haven't sewn in 20 years and can't believe how easy this machine is to use. Just take a few minutes to read the manual and you're set to go. The problem solving information was super helpful too. I have shopped around for a while and had an old Singer years ago, so I initially thought I'd go with a Singer model, but Boy! am I glad I didn't!!! This model is very sturdy and the quality is worth much more than this price. Within 2 hours I had set up the machine, read the manual, hemmed a pair of curtains, made a fleece throw and fixed a zipper in a pair of pants!!! I love the needle threader. I am so pelased with this machine that I'm telling everyone I know. If I can use this machine this quickly and successfully... anyone can!"
1,Can't Sew One Stitch!,"I am a complete beginner, and recently developed a new resolve to learn to sew...and bought this machine upon high recommendations of the sales person in a sewing shop. First, the auto threader does NOT work - maddening to even try. ...especially over and over and over again! Once manually threaded, it just jamms immediately when I try to sew a seam. Could easily be my mistake, as a complete novice, but I have followed the directions VERY carefully...From the reviews, I think it could be the machine. It just shouldn't be this hard to thread it and get a few stitches sewn!!"
3,Never arrived/No explanation,"I know it's not all that helpful, but I have to agree with the shipping problems. I ordered this item in early October and waited a full month before receiving an email saying it had actually shipped. After the expected arrival date came and went I received an email saying that it could not be delivered for an unknown reason. To be fair, I did get a refund, but one of the main reasons to buy online is the convenience. Maybe the trick is not to trust the super saving shipping methods. Anyway, I am going to try again because it does look like a solid machine."
3,Shipping delay and more shipping delays,"I would love to rate this more fairly BUT I can't because even though I ordered this machine 5 weeks ago, they are saying it won't be shipped for another 2 weeks and I won't receive this machine until around December 11.Shipping states 1-2 weeks........Don't count on itAs for the actual machine??????????????????????????????????"
5,"Bull's Eye, Bull Harmon","This is the first album I've gotten of theirs, and am so happy with it. The musicianship and arrangements are very professional, and the vocals are excellent, sung with power and soul. Bull's guitar playing especially caught my ear with the power he puts in the notes, and phrasing is so bluesy and yet you can still hear the melodies in those licks.Their sound is unique, yet distinguishable as bluegrass, which is difficult to acheive.Excellent overall!"
3,OK for the begining Application Professional,"As a developer, i did not find the book too useful. there was too much of a spin on Excel and too little on Word and Access. database development is the root of integrated applications. why so little attention on access? Case in point-on page 282 & 283, you failed to describe in detail what is going on in your sample code. code related to excel recieved more attention."
2,Okay if you like Excel...,"I got this book to write some VBA in Word97. 32 out of the 900+ pages are devoted to exactly that... almost. The problem is that this book doesn't give you the definitions of the objects and their parameters, so it's like trying to learn to speak (or write) a languange without a dictionary. Lots more examples for Excel and Access. Interesting that the object SELECTION is referenced under the section devoted to RANGE, when Woody Leonhard of the Annoyances series of books says SELECTION is superior (in Word, at least.) Also very few examples of using the code. I might be able to figure out the definitions by watching what the code does, but without examples.... Excel people will have better luck."
2,Disappointing!,"Patrick Wallingford loses his left hand to a lion's bite while working as a reporter on a news story in India. Dr. Sajac, a world famous neurosurgeon receives an offer from Doris Clausen to replace Patrick's lost hand with that of her husband Otto. The repercussions of this arrangement are somewhat surprising.What begins as a very interesting story with a typical John rving odd assortment of characters slowly deteriorates into the more mundane story of Patrick's sexual proclivities versus his desire to win Doris Clausen. It simply loses the threads of the lives of the other characters which make more lively reading. Although the novel induces the reader to want to reach the conclusion, the latter part of the story is far less engaging than the first half."
3,Entertaining and Fun,"I am one of John Irving's biggest fans - and have to say that I enjoyed The Forth Hand! Although not his best work, I still feel the story offered a lot to readers. It was very humorous - especially the bits on the bizarre hand doctor and Patrick's various sexual encounters. I also like the fact that Irving took inspiration from a 'real' story and turned it into one of his wildly entertaining and unlikely tales. This book is pure Irving - good fun and an easy read. I would recommended it to any John Irving fan."
4,a good read,"I enjoyed reading another Iriving novel, but while I'm an Irving fan, I've noticed something I don't like about his books. He never describes the character's emotions or feelings or body language or facial expressions. It almost makes the people seem two-dimensional. But besides that, this is still a good book. The story is kind of unusual, as are most Irving novels, but if you've enjoyed his other books, you should like this one too."
2,The worst of John Irving,"I generally adore John Irving's novels, but this one was a bitter disappointment. There was barely a plot, and nothing exciting ever happened to the characters. Don't waste your time or your money."
1,Give That Man A Hand--NOT!,"This book clinches it -- John Irving is very overrated. This book was mildly entertaining at first but quickly became tedious, irritating, and a waste of time to read. I ended the book with an overwhelming feeling of ""so what?"" Don't waste your time!"
2,Rambling and disappointing,"I did not like this book. I probably wouldn't have finished it, but it was a gift from someone who knows that I love ""A Prayer for Owen Meaney"" and ""The World According to Garp"", which are magnificent books. Alas, this is not.It rambles, it has poor characterisation, and what's worse, I didn't care about any of the characters. It is actually quite a dull book. John Irving is a very talented author, but this is a great disappointment."
2,Blah.,"I have read everything he's ever written, and I think a NYTimes reviewer got it right when he said (and I paraphrase) that this is more like a book by a student of John Irving than by the man himself. No good character development, nothing all that intriguing - the best thing about his books is that all the things that happen to the characters are usually believable. Not so in this case, and you don't care about them to boot. He's written much better."
4,"A great book, but as an Irving fan not his best","Speaking as a fan of Irving's previous work it's hard for me to say that any of his work not be vary good, but uncomfortably I get that feeling for The Fourth Hand. A beautiful story full of emotion that is captured with Irving's distinct style, but lacking in the detail ""length"" of characterization found in his previous work. While the story has great potential as a great Irving novel, the book leaves me with the feeling that it was underdeveloped. I highly recommend that you do read it though because it is still a great book. My expectations were higher though ..."
1,Don't buy this book!,"This book competes with ""Hotel New Hampshire"" for worst Irving book. He repeats, blatently, words and word themes through the book seemingly just to add girth to the tome and get it off to the publisher. Seems as if he had a great idea for a book, but really wasn't in the mood to write a book."
1,Not so much written but retold,"Having been an avid Irving fan for over twenty years, I had high expectations for The Fourth Hand. Irving disappoints me on just about every level. The characters are essentially one dimensional and static. One could see every plot twist long before it arrived. One reason I continued to read was that I was waiting for Irving to surprise me. He never did.The Fourth Hand borrows from just about every other book he's written with nothing new to offer. I got the sense that Irving was filling the quota of a book contract and we'll see his next effort with a new publisher. It's either that or Irving has chosen to rest on his laurels.I thought A Widow For One Year a stunning comeback from the abysmal Son Of The Circus. However, with this effort I have to begin to wonder if Irving has lost his will to write. Shallow characters, predictable plots and unresolved subplots just left me unfulfilled as a reader."
3,Forgettable,"I love John Irving. I love the way his stories start under the most bizarre situations, and I love how they make you believe in the unbelievable. Having been a huge fan of A Prayer for Owen Meany, I was waiting impatiently for the release of The Fourth Hand.I should have waited a bit longer. While Irving's character is certainly real enough, the idea of him inheriting the hand of a dead man, and then the dead man's wife making love to the hand as it's attached to our ""hero"" is, well, goofy. Irving to this point has had no problem selling weird ideas and scenarios to me. This one, however, was just too weird to comprehend.While it's an enjoyable read, it's quickly forgotten. Because our protagonist is unlikeable from the start, it's difficult to muster up any sympathy for him when dealing with a lion snatching his hand. One almost wishes the lion would have aimed higher and between the ears."
2,Fluffy and decidedly un-zany,"Like others, I was first drawn into John Irving's world with ""A Prayer for Owen Meany."" While that has remained my favorite, I have also enjoyed the rich complexity and colorful characters that mark many of his other novels. However, this novel, with perhaps his wackiest premise yet, remained flat. The characters were never compelling, and the intriguing premise never fulfilled its promise."
4,"Good, Fun Novel","This novel has been unfairly criticized here. Judging by some of the comments I've read, some readers seem to expect Mr. Irving to always produce something along the lines of ""A Prayer For Owen Meany"" so they can comment on the underlying themes and symbolism. This one is simply a very funny, enjoyable book based on an absurd scenario. It is also a great satire that aims its barbs at the news media. Read it and have some fun! I did."
3,Unless you've read all of Irving's other stuff...,"Irving's my favorite, and I read everything he writes as soon as it's out, but this was a little of a disappointment. I didn't feel the same connection to the characters that I normally do, and the prose was much lighter and faster than his better books. This was widely panned by critics, and although I didn't dislike it, it wasn't my favorite."
3,"Funny, entertaining, but ....","This book is funny and entertaining, and includes several laugh-out-loud passages. I like the story, although it is not as dynamic as I would expect, knowing that the auther is John Irving. Generally I am a big Irving fan, and I think that 'A Prayer for Owen Meany' and 'Son of the Circus' are fantastic books, maybe even modern classics. This one doesn't quite measure up, it's just too rough around the edges. Still, it's enjoyable - just don't expect the same quality (but it puzzles me why Irving would release such a book when it is clearly so much less of a literary effort....??)"
3,"better than some, not as good as others","this book was good but it didn't knock my socks off. mr irving is one of my favorite writers but this novel seemed like it was rushed to the printers. the typical irving humor was at work in this one but without the depth of his previous novels. although i have only read about half of his books, i would rank ""the cider house rules"", ""a prayer for owen meany"" and ""a widow for one year"" ahead of this book."
3,John Irving Lite,"A minor effort, not up to his usual complexity and depth. Amusing while you're reading it. Check it out from the library."
4,Even Mediocre Irving Is Still Better Than Most,"The Fourth Hand is not close to being Irving's best work. Owen Meaney is my 2nd favorite book of all time and this book does not come close. Having said that, this is still a good book. The writing style is a pleasure to read. The bizarre plot points are trademark Irving. I also enjoyed the redemptive themes of the book. All-in-all a worthwhile read, just don't have your hopes up too high."
2,Wishing for More,"As a huge John Irving fan, I was eagerly awaiting this read. It opens well, in somewhat classic Irving fashion, but then dissipates into mere possibilities. Interesting concept, but too much foreshadowing and forced twists. Found the characters to superficial and forced. I enjoyed Irving's commentary on the media and crisis, but can't recommend this one. If you must read it wait for the paperback, library edition, or better yet, for his next novel."
3,I am looking for the meaning,"I am sure that there is some wonderful message that I should have gotten from this book, but I still don't get it."
2,"Flat Style, Dull Book","John Irving has become a brand name. While the ""Show-Don't Tell Rule"" is hardly a ""rule"" that must be followed rigidly by every author, it was never more evident than in this book why this advice is so often repeated in writing lectures. Most of THE FOURTH HAND is summarized, like someone explaining what happened in the book, rather than dramatized with dialogue and action. If a new writer presented this, it would be discarded as lazy writing. John Irving, like Thomas Harris (HANNIBAL) or even Woody Allen, presents this based on the strength of his name, and people will praise it for that reason alone. I have to struggle to keep reading it, and I love many of Irving's earlier books. Then again, maybe this is ""Art"" and I'm just a moron."
2,The forth hand,"Irving must have felt pressure to get out a new book. This book was not of his usual quality or quantity. It did not contain his usual superb sentance structure. The Protaganist was unbelievable, underdeveloped and unlikeable. The sexual content was gratuitous. The only interesting story line was that of the surgeon and his son. I had to force myself to finish this book"
3,"The Fourth Hand, by John Irving","USUALLY JOHN IRVING IS A VERY GOOD AND A VERY FUNNY WRITER. AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT WE DID GET ACCUSTOMED TO. HE REALLY MAKES YOU LAUGH. THIS TIME HOWEVER, WE WERE DISAPPOINTED, BECAUSE THE FOURTH HAND DID NOT MAKE YOU LAUGH AS MUCH! AND IT IS TOO BAD BECAUSE THE BOOK STORY IS INTERESTING, BUT THE USUAL LAUGHS ARE NOT AS PLENTIFUL. IT CANNOT BE A JOHN IRVING BOOK WHEN YOU DO NOT HEAR THE READER CHUCKLE IN THE ROOM. EVEN OUR SON, WHO REMEMBERS READING JONN IRVING IN HIGH SCHOOL, REMINDED US HOW FUNNY AND ENTERTAINING HIS BOOKS WERE. HE ENDED UP READING ALL THOSE THAT EXISTED AT THE TIME AND THIS IS THE WAY WE WERE INTRODUCED TO JOHN IRVING!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Author John Irving is a literary icon, having won many awards. And because he has a great reputation he can get junk like this published. It is supposed to be amusing and/or droll, but it reads like a complete waste of time. It may be possible that there is some great message or point to be made here and I am just too stupid to see it. But, failing that, someone would have to point out to me what value there is in this rambling tale of sexual misadventures and attempts to transplant a hand. There is nothing more sad than an attempted joke that falls flat and that's all there is here."
3,Not Up to Irving's Standards,"This book was decent, but simply wasn't the same caliber of writing as Garp, Hotel New Hampshire, or Owen Meany. The Plot was far too simple, the characters less developed (and far fewer characters) than in other Irving works. I came away from the book very ""blah."" It didn't move me. Not bad, but not his best, by far."
2,IRVING LITE,"I consider John Irving my favorite author of fiction. I always look forward to each new novel. Having read all of his previous works, I have to say that this is definitely not up to his HIGH standards. The characters were not fully developed, nor did his writing entrance my imagination. I was not moved by, nor did I have any strong feelings for, any of the characters. To me the writing was like an outline for a movie (I understand that there is already a movie in the works). This might be one of those rare casees where the movie is better that the novel. If you are looking for a great novel, read ""Empire Falls"" or any of John Irving's previous books, but not ""The Fourth Hand."" Hopefully this new novel is one small bump in the road for Mr. Irving and he will return to his high standards with his next effort."
2,Hit a deadline?,"All I can say is at least every character wasn't an author. Beyond that who cares about Wallingford? Even if the point is that he is not to be cared about then don't make him your main character. I think the biggest problem with the book that made it not work for me was that I didn't really get the love affair between Otto (the 1st) and Mrs. Clausen, it didn't seem as great as it was later described as. Also, it seems Mr. Irving got a little more interested in writing about the sex then the characters. Anyway right after I finished it I picked up ""Setting Free the Bears"" and read a couple of chapters just to remind myself why I like this author so much. Maybe next time."
2,Hopelessly disappointed,"As an avid reader of John Irving, I'd hoped to be a naysayer to the common concensus that this book is a disappointment. Unfortunately, I have to agree. Probably my biggest complaint is that from an author that usually creates such complex, three-dimensional characters, I felt next to nothing for any of the characters in The Fourth Hand. In fact, Otto may have been the most well-developed character - and he was around for the shortest period of time. I think the story had potential but it fell well below its mark."
2,"Doesn't quite work, even for Irving fan","John Irving's characters are often quirky to say the least. Normally they draw one in. Irving's typical forays into the minds of the odd but believable individuals who populate his stories are usually irresistably intriguing. I have often had a difficult time putting an Irving novel down.This novel for some reason does not work. The characters did not interest me, and I neither liked nor disliked most of them. The plot drags on. I often considered putting the book down for good, and not finishing it, which is NOT like me, once I get in very far.Sorry for the short discussion, but I disliked this book so much I would rather not think about it too long now!For those who have not tried Irving, don't judge him by this one! I especially recommend A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY, one of my all time favorites, and THE CIDER HOUSE RULES."
3,OK,"""The Fourth Hand"" concerns a blithe TV reporter who loses his left hand on air to a lion attack and consequently finds love in the Midwestern widow of a hand donor. Clever story, really. Because I work in journalism, there was a special delight in the novel's contempt of 24-hour cable news, specifically, and of media sensationalism in general. And because I treasure all my body parts, it was intriguing to read a tightly researched book centered on a character who has lost one of his. But somehow the three story lines (Wallingford's rising and falling career, his lost hand and his found love) seem preposterously stitched together - kind of a Frankenstein book about too many things. Irving is a master writer of particular renown, but ""The Fourth Hand"" has virtually no surprises and offers up only middling literary value after the first act. The very arc of the story announces itself relatively early on and the characters, because they stay so rigidly on course, fail to interest."
2,Flat,"Visitation rights for a hand? I soldiered on through this book hoping that it would get better, but to no avail.Irving is a good storyteller, and there are several entertaining passages in Fourth Hand. Unfortunately, this time around Irving doesn&#65533;t manage to bring the quirky elements and offbeat characters together into a coherent novel as he had succeeded in doing in previous efforts (Garp and Owen Meany jump to mind). I read almost the whole novel on one long round-trip flight; had I not been a captive audience strapped into my seat at 30,000 feet I would have aborted the effort and selected something else form the bookcase. I&#65533;ll give the book two stars for a couple of funny scenes, but overall not recommended."
2,"It's Sure Not ""Garp""","I'm a big John Irving fan, and I've read almost all his books and enjoyed every one; some more than others, but each one was a worthwhile read. Not this one. I have to confess right up front that I was so disappointed in this that I never finished it. It was a big waste of time. I guess I might be getting alittle tired of all the contrived ""coincidences."" Don't bother buying it; Pick up a paperback copy at a neighborhood yard sale (the literary equivalent of going straight to video!)."
3,Does anyone see a parallel between U2 and Irving?,"John Irving has written many wonderful books, just ask him. The problem seems to be that he is all too aware of his success and seems to be completely captivated and awed by it. This is revealed in his memoirs and any interviews I have read. This book and his last (Widow) seem to be lacking something compared to Owen Meany, Garp, and even Son of the Circus. I see it as the same thing that happened with U2 (especially Bono). They made wonderful albums, just ask them. Then they became so enthralled with their success they began making self-conscious ""pop"" albums that paled in comparison to their earlier work. They both come across as ""we're so amazingly talented compared to everyone else."" In both cases, it seems becoming too impressed with yourself and being your own #1 fan may lead to a decline in quality."
4,Something differerent,"I live John Irving's books because they are different. He comes up with interesting characters and situations. The Fourth Hand was like nothing I have ever read. The only thing I did not like about this book was I feel it could have done without that whole chapter on Dr. Zajac. It was boring. I did not need to know about Dr. Z's failed marriage, that he was too skinny, that he had an obsession with dog poo. That whole chapter, to me, had nothing to do with the rest of the story.Other than that, great book."
2,watered down Irving deep disappointment,"I love John Irving's writing, and picked this book up without even reading the jacket copy. Initially, the story seemed engaging--a television news anchor loses his hand to a lion, becomes known as ""the lion guy"" and goes to work reporting for a tacky news show--and typical of Irving's wacky outlook. Yet, there was a desultory feeling all the way through the book that all would turn out as expected, and it did. The love story within the novel wasn't at all interesting, maybe because it focused on Patrick's life rather than Doris's. She was the interesting character, in my humble opinion. I had heard that Irving was incredibly persnickety about his books, often changing type after it had been set. What happened to this book? I'll read his next, though. This one just isn't up to the magic he's capable of creating."
2,Pointless and forgettable,"I've enjoyed John Irving before (Owen Meany, Water-Method Man), but this is the book that finally alters my classification of him from important author to hack popular novelist. This is a dull, meandering story with no believable characters or interesting ideas. The prose style is equally unmemorable. I just don't know why he wrote this."
2,"Pointless, not even funny","After finishing this book, I ended up thinking: so what? Irving's new book left me pretty unsatisfied. The plot is contrived and clumsy and the characters feel wooden. And to think this comes from Mr. Irving, the guy who usually makes you root for his characters. The only ones I really enjoyed were Irma and Dr. Zajac, and they virtually diappeared midthrough! Worse still, Irving overuses the technique of telling the story, instead of letting his characters speak from themselves. I can't recommend The Fourth Hand: Irving fans will find it disappointing and newcomers might as well try one of his better-known works.What a shame it wasn't better..."
1,The Greased Palm,"I can only assume that this book fulfills a contractual agreement (and was loosely- or NOT-edited because of an Oscar?). What an utter waste of paper, time, and money. I've been an avid fan of John Irving's work for years; that just changed. My only consolation: I put the book on the street with a note marked ""free,"" and at least someone else was spared paying for it."
3,A Fustrating Read,"While reading The Fourth Hand, I could not help but make notations on how the book could have been better. First of all, third person narration prevented me from feeling emotionally attached to Patrick Wallingford. After finishing the novel, I feel the third person narration was specifically used by Irving to illustrate the objective way of communicating personal stories on the news. This aspect does make the novel a bit more interesting because it raises questions such as: what is the news story behind the headline? Who is the person behind the individual we see everyday? However, some of the plot lines fall short by seeming incomplete. Incomplete plotlines did not keep the story round with intrigue."
3,Extremely Weak.,"This book could certainly win the 'Write a Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan romantic comedy in the style of a John Irving novel.' competition, but other than that couldn't win anything.Three stars, because even at his worst John Irving is better than most of what's being published today."
2,"Stop After You Read ""A Widow for One Year""","If only John Irving had hung up his pen after he wrote ""A Widow for One Year."" Irving claims this book attempts to answer a question about dreams - how do you know when you've had a dream of the future? My question for him is: ""Why do people - writers, (Irving, Heller) sports figures, Michael Jordan, etc., find it so difficult to quit while they're on top?"" A Widow for One Year was everything this book is not: interesting, full of well developed characters, witty, different. This book never explores the motivations of anyone, except in the most shallow, obvious manner.My advice to anyone who's read Hotel New Hampshire, The World According to Garp and AWFOY is to stop there, and don't read this book."
1,A Sad Disappointment,"For over 20 years I've been a loyal supporter of John Irving's ideas, and the quirky characters he creates to support them. I read The Fourth Hand to the very last page, and with each page i read, I was not only sadly disappointed, but angry. I wanted to call John on the phone and ask him, ""What the hell's the matter with you?"" I've read my last Irving novel. The love affair I had with the man and his books is over. Characters flat, story banal, nothing else to say."
2,Where is the development?,"John Irving has always been great at creating memorable characters and letting them drive his often outrageous stories, but this time his characters never develop, and the story seems to be contrived. It is a one note tune, and I am surprised Irving let it go as it is. While it was a quick, entertaining read, it lacked the depth to make it memorable. This will go on my bookshelf next to ""Son of the Circus""."
1,Waiting to be put out of my misery!,"I picked up this book at my local ... bookstore ... because the title caught my eye, the backcover blurb drew me in, and because Irving's 'Prayer for Owen Meaney' was one of my favorite books. This one, however, was a major disappointment. The characters were shallow and undeveloped and parts of the storyline were just so ridiculous. I mean...the widow wants to connect with her dead husband one more time so she seduces (and becomes impregnated by) the man who is going to receive his hand? Somebody explain this to me!Sorry...he could've done better. Like other reviews I've read, the books was short, but painfully long. As a bedtime reader, it took me at least a few weeks to get through the book because I kept falling asleep while reading. So far, John Irving has been hit or miss with me. This was one was definitely a miss."
1,I just discovered the meaning of the word,"I have read every John Irving novel, starting with Garp when I was still in High School. I went back and read his earier works, and I have loved everything he has written (except Son of the Circus, which left me saying, why why why for a month afterward). Honestly, some of his books, notably The Cider House Rules, have in some ways changed the way I view my life. I was so thrilled to get his new novel this July; but when I finished it I realized that it is ... I was so disappointed; although I will read his next novel, I will certainly be more cautious in my optimism."
1,What could he be thinking?,It is incomprehensible why Irving would have released this book. Fourth Hand lacks the colour and insight and joy we have come to expect from such an accomplished writer. The book is trite and dismissive and is more an invective against the media than anything else.It almost appears less a novel and more a script. Perhaps Irving has fallen to the lure of the moneyed agents and film industry. And who can blame him. What is art compared to healthy bank account?
1,What a load of rubbish .....................,"This is quite clearly the worse book I have ever read. Was this some sort of joke or was Irving also high on the drug that was administered to the main character when he lost his hand. I still don't get it - the whole book was a load of utter rubbish with every second page being taken up with 'hard-ons' and 'erections' For goodness sake,Irving grow up - who the heck wants to read trash like this.This book is NOT recommended by me - in fact don't even accept it as a gift, you'll be VERY sorry if you do!"
2,Don't Buy it Until You've Read More Reviews!,"Anyone who is a long-time fan of John Irving will be very disappointed in his latest work. I have read about 4 chapters and cannot believe this was written by the same person who gave us such masterpieces as ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"", ""The Cider House Rules"" and ""A Widow for One Year."" The character development is poor and the language less than artful and often amateurish. What started out as a brilliant way to demonstrate what would cause someone to change his/her life has been ruined by a sophmoric attempt at writing. Did he use a ghost writer?"
1,Terrible,This book was terrible. Very much a machismo story about a crippled man that has sex with every woman he meets. Not much else to it. Doesn't go anywhere.
2,So NOT a John Irving book,As a major fan of John Irving I was disappointed in this book. It's boring. He keeps saying it's comedic but it's not funny. I tried to like the characters but I didn't really care about them. No Owen Meany in sight. And yet it generates 263 reviews!
1,a disappointment,"I've read everything John Irving has published. This novel has none of the well-developed characters or beautiful turns of phrase of his earlier work. It's a disappointment. For much better work read The World According to Garp, A Prayer for Owen Meany or Trying to Save Piggy Sneed."
1,A huge disappointment,"John Irving has given us so many wonderful novels that awarding him a mere one star is painful - but only as painful as this empty, unappealing book. Was it the challenge of writing a novel about a vapid and shallow man that even he could not admire or like that produced such a work? With each new Irving title you hope for an experience as rich as ""Garp"" or ""Owen"" or ""Cider House."" This work is at the very bottom of the Irving canon. Better luck to all of us next time."
1,A disappointment,"John Irving is one of my favorite authors. His past works - and I've read them all - are so RICH and FULL. His use of words are in and of themselves, beautiful to read. I get close to his characters. I relate to them. They are real to me.In his latest work, Irving does well from the standpoint of pointing out what I call ""the ironies of the human condition"". He has always excelled at that. But there isn't much substance behind his story. His characters are flat and entice no empathy from this reader. I could love nor hate them.I guess my biggest disappointment are in the words themselves. An Irving phase or sentence could bring tears to my eyes in his other works. Not so with ""The Fourth Hand"". Like his characters, his words are flat, leaving me feeling ambivalent.I hope that Irving writes another book. I would read it without question. My hours of reading Owen and Garp would draw me back. No home library should be without his work."
2,From Absurd to Dullness,"Well, I was quite enthousiastic about Irving, after reading the New Hamphire Hotel and the water drinker novel (I know its spanish translation only, sorry), and there was a strong campaign for Irving in the formal press, with long and very positive articles dedicated to the newest novel by the Cider House Rules man.And it begins fast, funny and very very interesting, both on what Irving tells and the way he tells it. But... after the main character looses again the hand, the novel descends into the realms of nothingness, and an different novel begins; a very very ordinary love story. Besides, I am European, so I don't know anything about American Football...Remarkable, though; the whole episode of how Patrick lost his hand, the life of Surgeon Zajac and Patrick's sexual adventures with Monika with K and the chewing gum girl, and also the Indian Pills plot. The rest? just pages and pages of dull litterature."
2,Disappointed,"I had saved this novel to read during my summer vacation. As a long time Irving fan, I looked forward to reading this latest novel.How disappointing! This book can't be compared with his other works. I loved all his previous novels with 'a prayer for Owen Meany' being the absolute best.I can only agree with the other reviews, read his other works first."
1,SAD & BAD,"Where is my favorite author? The man that penned, THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP, OWEN MEANY and CIDER HOUSE RULES? Books that beg to be reread and given to people that you truly love. Fourth Hand had no redeeming value, characters that didn't interest me, and a plot that just didn't happen. If you haven't read, A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY or CIDER HOUSE RULES,you should! John Irving is an artist and wonderful author, and this book must have been written under some sort of duress. Mr. Irving, I look forward to your next work of art, obviously artists have bad days too."
2,Something missing,"If there's one flaw Irving's books *usually* suffer from, it's over-writing... Sometimes the character development gets a bit overdone and the plot progress grinds to a halt. However, this go-around Irving seems to suffer from the exact opposite: his characters are under-written... I found no compelling reason to like the Mrs. Clausen character, no understanding of why Wallingford cared for her so much, no sympathy for any character other than Dr. Zajac (who wasn't in the book much, unfortunately), and no interest in the developing love story. The whole 'mysticism' (the best way I can put it) surrounding Mrs. Clausen's motivation for donating her husband's hand, Otto and Patrick's reoccurring (and intertwining)dreams (especially that of the blue pill) just seemed like sloppy writing: Irving started to develop an idea, and then it just died midway through.Definitely disappointed with this one."
3,"The first half was great, but fizzled towards the end","I liked the first half a lot, but I got bored with the characters by the end of the book. John Irving goes off on tangents and that is part of his charm. I can't explain why the first half of the book was so good, but I later lost interest."
1,Irving is past his prme,"John Irving has not written a good novel since Owen Meaney. This book is not about dreams because it is a nightmare. Pat Wallingford is one of the most uninteresting characters I've ever encountered. The doctor and the housekeeper are the real interesting characters. This is a novel about eating and we could only have wished the lion took a bigger bite out of Patrick to spare us the agony. Too many of the minor characters read like acquainances of Irving's thinly veiled in fiction. Must be a fun inside joke for his friends to read, but otherwise don't bother."
2,Very Poor Outing,"As the author of Strike Hard, I was completely disappointed by John Irving's outing on this one. While his stories always seem to have a wave of what I term ""Wacky Humor"" to them, The Fourth Hand didn't even seem worth the effort. The premise of it being a ""story of love"" was completely lost on me, and seemed to center more on a morbidness.Hopefully his next one will be a lot better."
2,Disappointing,"I, too, am a big Irving fan who bought it first day out and read it in one sitting. Irving fans can't resist consuming it, but we can be disappointed once finishing it.I miss the weightiness of previous books. This book is a minor work with characters I didn't care too much about and a slight storyline. And even worse, it lacks charm."
2,Not Again!,"I've been reading Irving for 20 years. Son of the Circus was the first book I gave up on. Widow redeemed him but this book is another disappointment. Borrow it from the library, or a friend, or wait for the paperback. This one is not a keeper."
1,A zero if I could.,"This book is so silly...It makes me think that the ratings are rigged....I knew the subject was questionable, but all the reviews were encouraging about the end of the book...well, it was the same ole silly stuff the whole way through. I won't buy his books again, will wait for the library one to become available, that is - if I read his work again."
2,Boring,"I usually love John Irving's novels but in this one he managed to make a one-handed, good-looking, hard-luck, philandering news reporter boring. I didn't care about Patrick Wallingford. Someone in another review stated that he became ""emotionally involved with the characters."" I couldn't disagree more."
2,A disappointment,"John Irving is a wonderful author, but this is a disappointing book.The plot really didn't develop. At times it trailed off into dead-alleys. We were never given an insight into why the widow made the choices she made. In all, nothing too terrific. Irving himself, said at the end of the book, that the book was based on a thought expressed by his wife. Somehow or other, that's all there is - a thought - expanded across 300+ pages.I suppose it was too much to expect another marvel right after ""A widow for one year."" Let's hope that this is 'an in-between book' - that the next one will once again have Irving back to his genius standard."
4,"Not the best, but still a good buy","The Fourth Hand is certainly not John Irving's best effort, and if you have never read his work start with Garp or Owen Meany, because this should not be your first impression of his work, but it is not as bad as most of the reviewers have made it. I will grant that the characters are not particularly well developed and you don't really care about any one, especially the women who all seem to be made from the same mold, but otherwise it is well done. The plot is interesting, the writing is superb, it is a very fast-paced read, and in the end the reader is left with a warm heart. The comic element is as prevalent as in any of Irving's book and it it incorproates many contemporary events which makes it all the more immediate to readers, so I do not agree with many reviers that it is not interesting enough for them. I think this is a great book for any one who has experience with Irving, loves good fiction, and is looking for a fun, relatively easy read."
1,Where is Irving?,"Where is the John Irving who won my heart in 1978 with Garp? Definitely not in these pages. Loathesome characters, foolish plot.......could not waste the time finishing the last third of this wretched novel. Thank God for Jonathan Franzen whose ""The Corrections"" combines the best of 'good' Irving, Anne Tyler, and Tom Wolfe."
3,Disapointed,"I did enjoy this novel but I also was disappointed with this book. I expect more from John Irving. I do not have time for a long review but I will echo another review in this section. If you are a fan of John Irving you will enjoy this novel, even if you are somewhat disappointed. If you are new to Irving, read at least a few of his well-known novels before this one."
3,Uncharacteristically Flat,"As a reader who anticipates each new novel by John Irving as if it were Christmas morning, The Fourth Hand hit me as an uncharacteristically flat effort. While the prose are imbued with Irving's graceful yet down to earth brilliance, the characters lack the ""kaleidoscopic"" depth which Irving has nailed so often in the past. While I will not go so far as to suggest that fans of Irving forego the experience of this novel, I do caution them that they may feel unfulfilled upon reaching the novel's conclusion. This work unfortunately lacks Irving's gift for manipulating the absurdity and chaos of life into an unanticipated resolution which leaves us knowing more about what it means to be alive and human in this world."
2,100 Words or Less,"Though I consider myself to be an avid Irving fan, I hadn't read anything by him since ""Owen Meany"". So when I saw this novel (in the discount bin), I snatched it up.A huge disappointment. My main (and only) complaint is how unlikeable every character turned out to be. I was expecting quirkiness, but what I got was self-centered idiots. By pg. 75 they seemed so callous and mean-spirited that I didn't care what happened to them. So why should I keep reading? I didn't."
2,Irving Fans Will Be Disappointed,"As an avid Irving fan, I found The Fourth Hand to be one of his weakest works. True fans will read it because they love this author - and it's not a bad read. It's very funny in places, but those who expect something from Irving along the lines of Garp, Owen Meany, Cider House, or Widow will be sorely disappointed. The familiar theme of love as redemption rings a little hollow when the reader has a hard time caring much about the main character.The entire second chapter is dedicated to the maniacal Dr. Zajac, leading the reader to believe his story will be a true alternate plotline. However, Dr. Zajac receives little more than token treatment thereafter - like the third subplot of a sitcom. Ultimately, Dr. Zajac had the potential to be a much more compelling and sympathetic character than Patrick Wallingford.This may end up being a better movie than a book (I've read that Irving is already working up the screenplay - jeez, give a guy an Oscar!)"
2,Definitely not Owen Meany.,"Like some of the other reviewers, I am a big John Irving fan. And like the others, I found THE FOURTH HAND to be disappointing. It's John Irving gone over the top. Yes, he is the master of exaggeration and satire but this time his plot just turned ridiculous. Yes, there are some poignant moments... using STUART LITTLE to woo Rudy and Doris was lovely, and the wedding rings on the dock was breathtaking, but these moments are few and far between. I don't really care about football statistics or details of some guy's erection in my novels. Make me laugh or make me cry, John Irving. Unfortunately, all I did this time was yawn."
4,"Not as Good as ""Widow,"" But a Good Read","I've read a few of Irving's books and I think his fans will love The Fourth Hand. I liked it very much, as there were some strange twists and turns that make his books so much fun. I didn't this it was as good as ""Widow for One Year"" or ""Owen Meaney"" because the story wasn't as grand and it didn't get into the characters' heads as much.Still very much worth the time."
4,"Well, I have enjoyed it so far","I am currently about halfway done with this book and so far I have really enjoyed it. On a whim, I thought I'd see what other people thought of it because I don't know anyone who has yet read it. I was quite suprised to see the bad reviews. I too am a huge fan of John Irving. However, I am not disappointed (unlike many of the other reviewers). Perhaps I am not critical enough (I didn't major in English). That said, since other reviewers seem to think this book is an unwelcome departure for Mr. Irving, perhaps my husband will actually like this one (he could never get through any other of Mr. Irving books)."
3,DELTA FORCED!,Great game for it's day. Doesn't hold up to today's games but still fun. One of the best LAN shooters for it's time!!
4,Blue Horizen Wilbur Smith,I found this book amazing I couldn't put it downWilbur Smith describes every detail with such clarityGreat Story from one of the great story tellers
3,Product returned,"I had this product sent to an inmate in the County Jail. It was returned because there were ""stickers"" on the product. This is the second time this has happened."
4,You like a good Saga? This one's for you!,"An old-fashioned saga of the White-Man's-Burden variety in Africa. Good white guys battle the bad white guys and all condescend to the native population. A decidedly un PC book that I have to admit I devoured. Smith is a fluid and marvelous fiction writer. This one is set in Africa in about 1725 or so with Englishmen from Devonshire building a trade company in Capetown, then forced out by the importunate shennanigans of their youngest son who escapes the colony with a Dutch mail transported for her crimes. And, we're off from there! Lots of wild animals, trekking, adventures, ship lore and more. Yeah, I had fun with this. The sort of book that many fathers and brothers would enjoy. Some moms, too."
2,The party is over,"Having enjoyed a dozen or so of Smith's historical novels from the south of Africa, I am now sorry to say that he is getting boring. Smith has run of ideas, and trying to compensate by writing longer. His books have always been action-packed, and contained rather explicit descriptions of violence. However, both here and in Monsoon, a lot of the violence has no purpose. Two full pages with a deadly wounded man's battle with a vulture is very unnecessary. The plot is also flat, too few characters, most of them not make-belief. In the first of his Courtney-novels, the heroes had some flaws, and the villains had some relieving feature. In the last novels, nearly everybody are black or white. Please, let this be your last one, Mister Smith."
2,"great story, BUT","Excellent story, but whomever typed this book for the digital age needs to learn how to spell!"
4,"Great, read birds of prey and monsoon first....","I love reading Wilbur Smith, I wish some of his earlier Courney novels were not out of print....This started a little slow, but picked up and was great. Just a notch below Birds of Prey and Monsoon....."
4,Breath taking sweep,"This is the next book in the Courtney Dynasty series. Of course all the heros are dashing, the women gorgeous and the villians worthy opponents.Young Jim Courtney decides rescue Louisa from a prison ship. This commences a whole series of events that causes the family to pull up stakes and flee into the African interior and away by sea.On their journeys they must face warring tribes, bounty hunters, old enemies and new ones. Young Jim learns that what seemed like a good idea carries a hefty price, but as in all of these books the Courtneys triumph.This is a delicious read that takes through the heart of Africa and into the tribal wars that ultimately decide the fate of kingdoms.This is Wilbur Smith at his best."
5,the blue horizon,I love the whole series I read them several times. This is a gift to my cousin. It starts with birds of prey
3,Blue Horizon,"I am a big fan of historical fiction and Wilbur Smith. From a strictly fiction standpoint this novel is an exciting read. From a historical perspective, it leaves a lot to be desired. I was left with the feeling that I had not learned much, except some information about trade routes with Oman and the hierarchy within sheikdoms of that era. It is certainly an enjoyable read with lots of action and seafaring battles, including graphic violence and sexual situations. Not for the faint of heart."
5,Hooked on Wilbur Smith,"Someone lent me this book and after reading it I was hooked on Wilbur Smith. What an amazing writer! The character development and the plots he weaves kept me totally riveted and craving more of the Courtney family and old South Africa. I eventually bought every book I could find by Wilbur Smith, reading them all in chronological order so I could follow these amazing characters throughout their entire lives. One of my favorite authors!"
5,Great Album,"Amazing album. Heifetz knew what he was doing, at least when it came to music. You have to give him that, no matter who you are."
2,As if it's never going to be over,"Not all Almadovar's films are great, this one is unbearably familiar. The same plot of lust and betrayal between a film maker and an actor plus a very talkative transgender!With all due respect, I admire Bad Education entirely but without a proper review of those dialogues this film just all went straight to the drain. Almadovar made all talkings in it sound like one man or himself!"
3,Works okay,For a spray type polish this product does a fairly good job. The ease of the sprayer is super. I would rank this second behind the Weiman Cream. If I can't get the cream I would use this product again. And I would recommend this product.
5,Really Nice shine,We have Black Galaxy granite and this works very well on the black granite. Very Very pleased. I will purchase this product again.Fast shipping thru amazon and I saved gas.
5,Wow What a Product!,"I just wanted to let everyone know that this product is Amazing. I used the Granite Gold Daily Cleaner first and put this polish on. The countertops look like they did when they were first installed. Not to mention how easy it is to use, spray it on and wipe off with a paper towel. Give it a try trust me you wont be disappointed! Great job on a great product!"
2,Leaves Streaks,"I'm a fan of the granite gold series of cleaners and have found their other products to be effective so I was really disappointed in the polish. I had read the reviews prior to purchase, but thought I'd give it a try anyway, but it didn't impress me. The polish leaves streaks and in order to get the streaks to disappear it take ALOT of elbow grease. Too much work for me."
2,Cant really tell if it works or not....,It doesnt make a shine as they advertise it...i use it on my granite counters...
4,Shipped with sprayer top loose!,"It's hard to evaluate a product when 25% of the liquid is soaked in the carton it came in. I complaine twicw with no response from anyone! I've used other granite gold products But I bought directly from the company. There good products, stay away from distributors!"
4,Good game,"I don't agree with the previous reviewer. This game is a lot of fun. It certainly isn't the best game for the Nintendo DS, but it is one of the few adult oriented games on the DS. The graphics are good, and the sound isn't bad either. If you enjoy story driven military games - you'll enjoy this. The 4 player mode is a lot of fun also!"
2,Just too far of a step back in time.,I might have enjoyed this game when I was 12 but today I'm just too spoiled. The graphics and jumpy gameplay are just too basic for me to enjoy this one. It's too bad because helicopters are my favorite thing on this earth so I'm just praying that a good helo simulation will come around eventually.
4,A Good Start,This is an excellent overview of current mainstream research and a balanced look atother views. The link to her website for demonstrations was novel and make the booka better than average read. For those interested in further study I would suggest:The Field and The Intention Experiment by Lynne McTaggart; The Biology of Belief byBruce Lippton and Edgar Cayce: On Mysteries of the Mind by Henry Reed.
1,Bo DVD,"Although Fumio Demura is a legend, this DVD does not do him justice. Buy his book. The book ""BO - a karate weapon of self defense"" is much better. The worst part of the DVD is that there is no section breaks (scene selection) where you can skip to the next scene. For better instruction get the DVD from Turtle Press (Jang Bong Fundamentals & Patterns DVD) or even the chinese staff dvds they teach you more."
4,Pre-historic Metal 101,"Well, like many Priest fans I glomm onto the Screaming For Vengence era. It's pretty obvious the band was very good back in these days, but other than Halford, the group seemed to lack an identity all their own. Not to take anything away from the music, it is actually quite fantastic, but lacks something. I'm surprised how often ""the sound"" of old Priest sounds like Kiss's first cd. That would change later on. I like the song selection here for the most part and while you get a ""feel"" for old Priest, and can lock this away for a rainy day, it saves some time and a lot of money in NOT buying all the early Priest cd's which are good but uneven."
4,Great Book! Tolerances,"This book is a useful pocket reference for any MD, PA or NP new to orthopedics"
2,I Bought a Lemon,"I purchased the 22 580 Delta planer from Amazon about 3 years ago and have used it in my shop on the average of one hour a week. After two years of service the motor armature had to be replaced. Last week I took it in to the Delta service center because it was so noisy. I was informed that the shaft on cutter head was damaged and that the cutter head, pully, bearings and etc. had to be replaced and that it would be more practical to purchase a new planer. My last planer was a Riobi and it was still running well after giving me ten years of service, talk about a comparison of service. I am not a happy camper!!"
4,NJ Woodworker,"I had a few shipping problems and that is why I'm giving it 4 stars. I was missing wrench and knife tool, which is on order from Delta. Also, my belt was loose and I had to adjust it to make the knives work. It runs great now and I'll let you know in a few weeks how well it performs."
4,Nice machine!,"I admit to limited experience with this type of machine, but my kids bought me this one, and it is a beauty. Much quieter than I expected, and very easy to use.Especially useful features are the cutter ""zero"" indicator that lets you automatically find the level of the top of your workpiece. Also recommended is the dual speed feature for extra smooth final cuts.I did a few heavy cuts on a wide piece of wood, and there was only the slightest drop in speed. Certainly this machine is way more powerful than I will ever need!The only items I would like to see different would be cast and milled in and out support panels to replace the stamped sheet metal ones.I highly recommend it."
3,Delta 22-580,"I have had this planer for about 30 months and used it for oak and walnut planing. The key for pulley for the cutter head shifted causing the pulley to go out of round requiring me to buy a new cutter head and other parts to rebuild, over $200 in parts. Had it up and running and ran one 1""x6""x8' walnut board through it and it broke the pinion gear for the rollers. The factory has part on back order so don't know when the part will get here. I like the finish of the wood put through it, but would not buy another one. I can buy cheap and run till they break and buy another one cheaper than I can keep this one running. If they can't keep parts for it why pay high dollar and not have the use of it. Brother-in-law has a Ryobi he has had for years and it has never once cost him money or time."
2,poor feed,"I've had this Delta planer for two years and it has not fed wood into the unit well from the very beginning, even though I've, yes, read the directions and made the block as specified to adjust the feed bar."
3,Why would you ever use a planer without dust collection?,"To me the answer is obvious, but Delta did not think so when they pack the planer. You have to buy the dust connector as an optional accessory. Come on, give me a break. You paid $400 for the machine and still have to pay $25 for that $5 worth of plastic thing and wait a few days before you can use it? Don't know how the machine cuts yet since I don't want to use it without hooking up to a dust collector."
1,it was never shipped complete,when i got this item it was not complete no manual no handles no hardware and the box was smashed up so they shipped me another one and it was in the same shape as the other one the box was smashed up no hardware no manual. so i called customer service and i could not understand what that person was saying.
2,Feeding problems galore,"Bought the planer mid-summer 2004. Before the end of the year the planer began requiring ""help"" to keep the boards moving. Periodically it would just hang, burning the board. A quick nudge was needed to continue feeding.Normal maintenance includes cleaning the rollers. The manual says to use a scotch pad and soapy water. I also adjusted the outfeed roller per the manual. This would fix the problem for a while, but it would slowly go back to its old ways. Eventually it gets so bad it requires a constant pushing or pulling to get the boards to feed continuously. Dangerous, frustrating, and leads to poor results. The finish when it works is amazing, but I have found the machine to be a poor substitute for a heavier duty unit. I am only a hobbyist, building boxes and some small furniture."
5,Smooth and accurate,"The setup of this planer was simple and the manual most hepful. The two stage finishing planer allows even hard boards like maple to be accurately planed and reduces sanding. Dust is easily controlled and safety of the product is maximized by the manufacturer. A thirteen inch planer has met all my needs. As with all planers, eye and ear protection is a necessity. You will be most happy with this product."
1,Amazon shipped me Used / Refurbished Planer !!!,"I bought this planer from Amazon and was surprised to see the way it arrived in damaged Box.Well, When I opened the box, I could not find the manual / instructional video / wrenches in the box and machine clearly looked like 'Used Before'. I checked the stores in my area for this planer and they told me that I must get all these items in the box if product is brand new else it is refurbished one being sold as 'New'. Also I found that front plate clearly out of 90 degrees.I am very disappointed with this and never expected amazon/delta will ship used/refurbished products as 'Brand new'.I have called amazon and waiting see if they offer a replacement. I really wish they will give me replacement ( Brand new planer ) and not the money back as based on reviews , I really would like to have this planer.I will update my review once I hear from Amazon."
1,DELTA is less than forthright,"I've just received this planer and all is okay except, to my very great surprise, it is not possible to resharpen and then use the blades {which cost about$40.00 a pair}. While DELTA is normally excellent in describing its products, this apparent ""marketing decision"" {DELTA's term per a telephone conversation 6.26.02} not to make clear that blade sharpening is not an option, is in my view .... at best less than forthright. In the hope that this might cause the marketing folks at DELTA to rethink their approach here, I am giving this the very lowest rating."
4,Excellent Planer but . . . . . .,"For the money this is a great buy. Other reviews cover all the positives. Here are some improvements that I would like to see.1)Offer carbide blades2)The plastic housings for the belt drive and the powerfeed rollers gear assembly do not seal out dust properly. Foam weather stripping is used on the bottom of the gear assembly housing. Cheap fix for a bad design.3)Use ball bearings in place of brass sleave bearings. The only use of ball bearings is found on the cutting blade roller and the motor.4)Replace all plastic housings with metalBuild me a tool that lasts a lifetime and I'll be your customer for life. If it costs more, I'll pay it."
3,OK but problems feeding stock.,I've had this planer for about 9 months and recently had trouble feeding stock. It will feed about 4 inches and then just stop. The rollers don't appear to be slipping they just stop rolling. It is very difficult to pull the stock out and when I do it has a bit of a divot from being under the blades so long. I've cleaned the rollers and still had the problem. After talking with Delta I've taken it in for service. My older 12 1/2 Delta inch planer never had any problems.I think if I had the choice I'd pay the extra money for the DeWalt. As soon as mine comes back from the repair shop some lucky person on EBAY will have the chance to buy it.
1,Defective Infeed & Outfeed Roller Operation,After setting planer up and while running a test piece board I noticed the infeed roller did not feed the board as it should. After careful inspection I found out the drive chain that drive the infeed roller and outfeed roller thru a gearbox was not hooked up to the gear assembly (even though the cutters were turning). Delta service told me the drive shaft from the gearbox was not keyed to roller drive gears. I couldn't imagine how such a glaring error and important operation could've escaped inspection at the factory. I was then told by the Delta authorized service center that it would take about4 to 5 weeks to get the part to fix the problem. I will think twice before I buy another Delta product.
2,Professional high end furniture maker,"I bought this planer over a year ago after a lot of research and decided it must be worth the extra cost. I'm not sure why all of the trade magazines gave it such a high review. My complaints about this machine are many. Poor dust collection. I have it hooked up to a jet 1,100 cfm collector and still get a fair amount of debri. The dust chute (which you have to pay extra for) gets in the way and one has to flip it around everytime you need the collector on the other side. The two speeds are a gimick. There appears to me to be no difference in the quality of cut. The knives do not last very long and are prone to little chips. Lastly the ""blade zero"" switch is not accurate. So after a year of frustration I bought a Dewalt DW735. This planer is a sure winner. I love it. Now this machine is worth the money. It is really too bad that delta has really gone down hill in the last few years. Hope they can step it up."
1,Feed Problems Continue,"My 22-580 planer is a $400 doorstop. From the beginning, it had problems feeding the wood. Now, 9 months later, it barely feeds at all. I don't know if the rollers are too slick or the unadjustable front roller is mounted too low. The manual offers no solutions that work. And if you look through the reviews that follow mine, you'll find several cutomers have the same problem. I wish I looked at them more closely."
4,It's Real...,"This is one of the most real and insightful CDs I've ever heard. If you don't have it, get it.. Definite Banger.."
2,...Eh... Not so much,"I picked them up for an Xbox 360 since the 360 is notorious for scratching discs, even while the system is stationary. The skins did take the brunt of the console abuse, scratching the skins and not the games. The problem is that there is play in the size of the skin compared to the disc (understandable since you have to squeeze it over the disc.) The problem with the play is it creates an effect like a warped disc, that the laser cannot read through. If you leave the covered disc in the 360 long enough, it heats up enough to smooth the back out a bit. It's just a hassle making it just right so that the game will play. It may work with less data intensive media like CDs."
1,Not all it's cracked up to be,"While I'm sure my problems are unique, the promise of the d-skin fails to live up to it potential. They do not work in the Wii and they do not work in my Apple iBook and they do not work in our Sony DVD-R player/recorder. Unfortunately these were going to be the most utilized places for any disks we would put the d-skins on. I'm bummed."
1,To good to be true,I would never purchase this product again. They did not work on cd's. And I used them on a new dvd in our van and when I went to eject the movie it was stuck. I had to have my dvd player replaced because of it.
5,Ellen Gunderson Traylor,"For fun reading, these novels are among some of the best. They are however novels"
3,Mostly bland.,"It was a very interesting attempt, however it fell somewhat flat.This story felt very amateurish, and yet I understand this was not the author's first published work. Beautiful descriptions were given about the characters and scenery but had a very childish sounding narrative. Perhaps if the plot had been darker, more sinister."
1,Don't waste your money!,"It is hard for me to believe that the same person who wrote ""Song of Abraham"" wrote this book. I'm sorry to be so negative, but this book was so bad that I was embarassed for the writer. Do not even contemplate for a second whether or not to buy this book. It is TERRIBLE. It's written as if the reader was 7 years old, with the most implausible, far-fetched scenarios one could have dreamt up! For example, the angels are ""born"" as suddenly just appearing in some sort of birthing field, where they just appear and see they have hands and know they are beautiful. Unfortunately, they apparently aren't too smart and speak like 5 year olds. Oh, it's terrible. That's all I can say. I wish I could get my money back."
2,Afternoon Devotional,"The Author of this book is quite open about his ideas. However, these ideas are repeated quite frequently. Often, I would feel as though I had already read a particular section of a chapter, when actually it was something ""new"". Also, something very apparent from the start is the Author's pessimistic personality. While I am not saying that the book should have been written ""happy-go-lucky"", I would have felt more comfortable reading the book if the Author had more ""love for life"". Not sensing an apparent joy in the writing I feel as though the writer may be struggling in his own faith. This of which would make writing a book on faith not necessarily the best idea. Throughout the book there also is a sense of disconnection between the writer and reader. It seems as though the writer is trying to connect with a non-Christian, rather than a Christian working towards a greater faith. The book isn't a difficult read and would perhaps make for a good afternoon devotional."
4,Not one weak track...,"Unless you want to count Santana or War, I know very little about Latin music. But I do know this is a great collection. I have heard of none of the artists (except Los Mocossos rings a bell) but it's very diverse within this genre, crossing over into funk, rap and rock. Not one weak track. Also includes a 24 page booklet."
5,Keep it on replay,"Any sexier and spicier and you'll have to call the fire department and the cops. Famous hot hits that never fade in the Latin music scene include Se Escaparon [T2] and Represent [T9]... BUT i was pleasantly suprised with the hidden 10th track! Absolutely on STEAM!This is a tight collection, the best in my opinion, of the Putumayo Series."
3,inconsistent width,"the tape worked fine and was of general good quality, but the width was inconsistent and not full width so I was unable to use several feet of it."
3,fantastic fantasy,This story was a wonderful fantasy story for your pre-teen. I think it will touch the young fantazsies of all of us.
4,A must read,"If you read book one, I don't realy need to say alot about book two. Bruce Coville has turned into my 9 year olds favorite author. She loves animal/unicorn adventure books, and mystery. I would say these books have it all!"
5,Song of the Wanderer,"I read this book (after reading the first book) with a group of 5th grade girls who are eccelerated readers. The girls and I could not put the book down! This book brought with it friendship, family ties & a great deal of suspense. I would recommend this book for young readers, but also for adults who love fantansy. The ending is wonderful & we can't wait for Book 3!"
4,Journey to the Past,"Like the first book in the series, this book was intended for a younger audience. Sometimes the writing doesn't flow together well. But overall, the story is good. I did find myself skimming over some parts of the story but I did like reading it. I finished it in an evening."
5,The Unicorn Chronicles book # 2,"i really really liked this book . it made made me cry. it is one of the BEST books i have read next to ""into the land of the unicorns"" and a few others. i am 14 but, i am in to all the unicorn stuff. i hope there is going to be a 3rd unicorn chronicle. Bruce Coville can write 50 Unicorn Chronicles and i would never get bored with them! Lady Dragofire"
5,Another Unicorn Magic,"In this story Cara is still on her journy but is going to get the Wanderer, her grandmother, to bring her back to Luster. What she dosen't know is that her grandmother is a unicorn."
1,no book 2 yet,"I have not been able to get this book 2 yet, but I know if it follows book 1, it will be fantastic. Hurry an get more out. Thanks"
5,The song of the wanderer,This book is wonderful.It gives readers a chance to let there imagination expand.Although i would encorage you to read the first unicorn chronicles book before you read this. This book is ful of suspence surprises and sadness.its grrrrrrreat!i would rate 6 stars if i had the choice!
5,I loved it!,"This book brought back all the characters of the original and introduced some others just as loveable. I have waited years for it to come out and was not disappointed! I recomend this book for anyone! I think it is even better than the first, if that is possible!"
5,Wander into This One!,"I LOVE this book and I think you would too. Bruce Coville REALY did a good job writing these books, and he also did a grrreat job on describing the characters too. I got this book at my grandmother's book fair and I didn't even notice it was the second one 'till I actually looked inside it! But it was still a great book! Or if you've read THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy than I think you would looove this trilogy."
5,This book was awesome!,"I was hesitant to buy this book, since I had never read book one and am more of a science fiction reader than a fantasy reader. To my surprise, I was delighted by SONG OF THE WANDERER. I thought Cara was a great character, who must deel with her heritage, and the choices her ancestors made and what side they were on, and how it affects her. The book was fast-paced and exciting, and never lagged. Mr. Coville has written a perfect book. Now I can't wait to read book one, INTO THE LAND OF THE UNICORNS, and hope that book three doesn't take too long to come out. But if it's as good as this one was, it will be worth the wait!"
5,Loving It,"I really loved this book. It was even better then some of the Harry Potter books. I just couldn't put it down. I kept telling myself just finish the chapter then STOP! Of course that didn't work. In the book most of your questions from the previous novel, Into The Land Of Unicorns, are answered. Also Cara is on a quest to bring her grandmother, known as the Wanderer, back to the unicorns while also trying to save the unicorns from Beloved. Also what about her crazy past, who is her real mother anyway? Read all about Cara's quest and more in Song of The Wanderer, by Bruce Coville. It was one of the best books I've ever read!"
5,Wow!!! :-),"Here's me, wildcat once again. You know, that influential teacher Mr. Kelly (Look at my review of the Chronicles of Narnia) read the first book of these to us in 3rd grade, along with many other books by Bruce Coville. (Bruce Coville was, obviously, one of his favorite authors.) Ever since then, I've been waiting and waiting for the second book, along with my sister, Tara.Believe me, it was totally WORTH the wait!!! It is my opinion that waiting for a good book makes it all the more pleasurable,and this is certainly one of those books!! This wonderful author also leaves the end opent o another book. Can't wait to get my hands on it!!READ it. You will not be dissapointed."
2,Don't waste your time or money,"This is by far the stupidest book I have ever read. As a matter of fact, I didn't even finish it. It went to the Salvation Army store."
2,Annoyed....,"Annoyed, that's how I felt while reading these books. I didn't realize I was reading two short stories but I made it through the first book, ok. I was having a hectic time and the no brainer novel was on my mentality level. When I got to the second novel, which came as a surprise - that there was a second one, I expected a repeat of the first one so I read on. I could not believe how boring, predictable and implausibly of this book. There were no descriptions of any of the characters other than observations such as, 'he wiggled his eyebrows to show his interest'...lame, just lame wording like that. The slang came from the 1800's and I just could not believe this author was actually making a living writing books such as these. That's it. I feel better now. I needed to vent the fact that I feel you have to be under 10 or over 90 to appreciate this / these books."
2,Half and half,"The second story in this book isn't bad... but the first one is really predictable. You know exactly what's going to happen from the very beginning, and the only reason to keep reading is to see if it's as bad as you think. Debbie Macomber's more recent books are much, much, much better. You can tell this was an early effort and it doesn't live up to what readers expect from Debbie Macomber. I love her later stories... but this one, skip."
4,love it,Debbie never fails to deliver and this was a wonderful read. Just wish she would write as fast as I can read
5,awesome,great little short stories made me excited for christmas and see people fall in Loveread in one day!!!love Debbie Macomber's books
5,On A Snowy Night,I loved both The Christmas Basket and The Snow Bride. Debbie Macomber always writes beautiful stories. She is a wholesome author and makes you feel like you are right there with the characters. Beautifully written.
1,poor rating,I didn't like the lyrics to the songs very much. I liked some of the bands on the CD though
4,Good Reference Tool,"This is a great tool to have on in the car for myself and with my children listening.... Great tips on how to be ""appropriate"" in life. I especially love to hear my little one use that word and in the right context.Practical no nonsense information that is helpful in life...."
3,Magnet fun,"Wonderboard Fun-With-FacesSuper fun but not very durable. Magnet page is weak and magnet design rips off fairly easily. A plane ride toy, not made to last."
4,Good Film,"The great thing about this movie is the final shot. I won't give anything away but the shot is breathtaking. Nicholson's performance is very subdued, very similar to other performances of his back in the 70's. The film does have some flaws, but overall it's a very good movie. It's not quite as good as Antonioni's 'Blow Up' but it's definately worth a viewing."
4,Worth the Wait,It was fun watching a young Jack Nicholson with Maria Schneider in a performance I read was rated one of his best. It's kind of like some old Rolling Stones songs though; you have to be a fan to appreciate them. Well you have to like Jack to appreciate this one. I can't help but think that the only reason Maria Schneider got this role was because of her notariety from Last Tango In Paris. I found her performance lackluster and kept thinking there had to be many choices which would have been better than her. Heck they even had to change the premise because she could not drive; what sense did that make?The final scene was truly amazing when you realize just what they had to do to make it and is reminiscent of the opening scene in Touch of Evil in that it broke new ground.I especially enjoyed being able to subsequently watch the movie with Jack's commentary. That is a great feature of the DVD.
4,"Clumsy plot, beautiful images","Other reviewers here have pointed out the essential ups and downs of this film. Like ""Blow Up,"" this is another metaphysical thriller that uses the skeleton expectations of the action/adventure genre but slows down the tempo to focus on identity and alienation. The plot is improbable. How could the gunrunners not recognize that Jack Nicholson is not the gentleman they were expecting?But the storyline is not the reason to watch this film. The way Antonioni films the world is a feast for the eyes. The North African landscape is especially stunning -- the desert, villages, and people. The film begins there and ends in a similarly dry and striking landscape, this time in southern Spain. At this final resting point Jack Nicholson delivers a monologue about how hopeless and dusty the world is. But it seems ineffective and slightly ridiculous after so many beautiful images."
2,Painfully Slow!,"When Maria Schneider died last month, I read about her and discoverd she had made a movie with one of favorite actors, Jack Nicholson, that I had never seen. So I watched the previews on the internet and it looked great. A man is bored with his life, finds a man dead that looks like him, so takes on his identity to have a better life, unfortunately this causes problems. The premise and the previews are great. The movie is SLOW, SLOW, SLOW. The acting of Nicholson and Schneider is nothing special and not much happens. Three of us watched the movie and two of us fell asleep. I'm giving it two stars because it was filmed nicely and maybe there is a chance I missed something fabulous while I was asleep. Watch the preview that's enough!"
2,Least of my fav. Jack films,This movie is unsure of exactly where it wants Jack to go or how he should get there. After fumbling around for awhile it finally finds its way to an ending in which even the cast seems relieved that it's finally over. If it weren't for Jack no one would've ever heard of it.
4,Good for beginners,I recently bought this so I could make some window treatments and things for around the house. I had not sewn since Home-Ec class in junior high. This machine is easy to use and works well. it even has a buttonhole function. Directions on how to thread the machine and wind the bobbin are fairly easy to understand although I did have to read them a couple of times since I was unfamiliar with sewing.
1,Lemon maybe?,"Easy to use, yes. As long as it keeps working for you. Every time i want to do something simple like take in a dress, make a baby blanket, take something up. It seems something always goes wrong. I can usually fix it, but this last time i have no clue what is wrong, but i cant wait to get rid of it. I'm now looking into getting a Brother cant wait! summery, I think there are better ones out there."
2,i cant belive i paid for this,this dvd is not funny its slow! it seems like smoked one to many joints before getting on stage the only funny part is when the fat guy plays paino. people that think this is funny should check out a real comedian like jimmy carr sean lock or sarah silverman.
4,Ross is back,"He definitely knows how to roast. His stand-up routine is great, even the piano+poem segment for a while. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because he carried too long with the poem routine."
4,Pretty damn funny ;),"Wife even watched it with me. There was not a lot of continuous laughter from us, but the few things we liked we still quote from time to time..... ""Cookies are a sometimes snack!"" YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Great Roaster, Average Stand Up Comic","If you're like me you've seen Jeff Ross on the Comedy Central Roast, and if your reading this you probably really liked him on them, as did I, he is great in them. But in his own stand up special just average."
3,Inconsistent,"This is another collection of occasional articles, a follow up to - The Moronic Inferno.This also consists of reviews and interviews of the famous and not so famous. There are also a couple of travel pieces thrown in as well.This collection does not have the consistency of the previous one and some of it has a "" scraping the bottom of the filing cabinet "" feel. As in - Cannes - where he rambles on about topless beaches, he even apologises in a new preface for the standard of the article.Most unforgivable of all he does a very disparaging review of a Rolling Stones concert. This is a mortal sin.When he is good Amis is excellent as in - Chess: Kasporov v Karpov - on the world of chess. I found out it that cheating has been rampant in chess for hundreds of years, not out and out stealing of pieces, but very heavy gamesmanship, fascinating stuff.This is still worth the read but not as good as other articles that he has put together, but not a bad Sunday filler."
4,"Nice shoes, run a little large","These shoes run a little large. I normally wear an 8.5, but I should have ordered these in an 8. Very cute and comfortable, though."
2,Disney Royal Nursery,"$17.98 is not worth a doll that is 6"" tall. I thought it was a baby doll not a miniture doll."
5,SMALL BUT CUTE.,WELL SHE LOOKS PRETTY SMALL TO ME. (MAYBE SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN A KELLY DOLL) BUT SHE IS AWFULLY CUTE. I GIVE HER 5 STARS. HOWEVER I AM ONLY GOING BY THE PICTURE. I DO NOT OWN THIS DOLL.
4,VERY HAPPY,"VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE. SET UP WAS SIMPLE. I AM USING A WIRED LAN WITH POWERED COMPUTER SPEAKERS. A LITTLE EXPENSIVE, BUT WORKS GREAT."
3,good solution for digital audio files,"this seems to be a good solution for digital audio files, but you guys may wanna also check this other one, at [...], it's a new one that looks like might provide higher audio quality"
5,The best of Bruce's books about the Beatles,"I bought these books when they first came out, and i wasn't disappointed. I previously read Bruce's book on Vee-Jay - and if you haven't read that then you should check it out too.The Capitol volumes are easily the best, because they cover the Beatles best records. Everything from Meet The Beatles to Magical Mystery Tour is here, with the singles to match.You get the album art and labels in full-colour, with info on the records like release dates and sales etc.He also tells the story behind each release. For example, the famous Butcher cover gets a full run-down, as do the early Capitol singles when EMI had to bully them into releasing them.Everything you ever wanted to know about the records is here.A book for collectors."
4,"Good stupid fun, as it is meant to be!","Good stupid fun, cheesy but it knows it. I know some of the history of this movie, it was not meant to be a super high quality five star Hollywood blockbuster, this was filmed on a budget. It was meant to be an entertaining B film, and in that it succeeded greatly. I know that the main actors in this movie are all up and coming in Hollywood right now, I think their future is very bright!"
4,Get ready for a trip!,This movie is an acid trip wrapped in a meth hangover. It's not for the faint of heart but those that enjoy dark humor and wicked characters will get a kick out of it. Possible cult status awaits.
4,A Mind-bending Manifesto,"Less a critical survey than a manifesto for the neuron-altering powers of ""breakbeat science,"" this ingenious book traces the development of sampladelia from the ""jazz fission"" era of '68-'75 (with excellent analyses of George Russell's and Herbie Hancock's sonic experiments), through the Parliament/Funkadelic groovescapes of the late '70s (including close scrutiny of Pedro Bell's subversive cover art), through Electro (early '80s synth oriented hip hop) and Detroit Techno, to the present Jungle milieu of time stretching and spatio-acoustics. Eschewing a traditional music-crit vocabulary in favor of a riffing, neologistic verbal poetics, Eshun perfectly captures the sci-fi convolutions of the music he describes, and makes an infectious case for the birth of a new audio-paradigm."
5,A price guide packed with color photos,"English transferware holds flower and scenery patterns which look like Blue Willow: usually one-color, they can be multi-color scenes imprinted on plats, dishes, cups and saucers. ENGLISH TRANSFERWARE: POPULAR 20TH CENTURY PATTERNS surveys all the 20th century patterns and includes a price guide, offering color photos throughout to accompany gorgeous, well-detailed photos and notes on makers, marks, and more. Any who collect English pottery must have ENGLISH TRANSFERWARE is a basic reference."
3,you get what you pay for,the drill is okay- not near my regular Dewalt series. although I understand they are owned by same company. The flashlight broke on the 2nd use. Just popped like a flash bulb. Have not evaluated the circ saw and the saw zall parts yet. I also dont like the fact that you damage the battery if you leave on the charger for more than 8 hours. they need to incorporate a trickle charger that you can leave battery on when not in use. Also the charger with this unit is very slow-6 hours?
1,Nice looking tools but...,"This tool kit looks so good when you open the box. The orange color grabs your attention. I also like the handy storage case which is easy to carry and stores the tools well. However, I was frustrated by how slow the charger is - 6 hours to charge up a battary. I also don't like the fact that the charger will actually damage the battary if you leave it charging too long. This needs to be a trickle charge like a Makita. The worst thing is that the flashlight burned out in 20 minutes! I was also underwhelmed with the Sawzall. The Sawzall stalled out when I was cutting through balsa wood? This unit needs more power.Black & Decker should spend less money on the fancy packaging and more money on power, performance and quality."
2,Battery Charger Problem,"I read the other review about the problem with the Black & Decker battery charger. I also had my charger quit on me. I had 2 batteries that came with the drill. I bought another 14.4 volt B&D product so I could continue to use the drill. I quickly found out it wasn't the battery charger that was causing the problem. When I tried to recharge one of the old batteries in my new charger, it quit like the old one. After calling B&D, I was told the problem is with the battery. Once the battery goes, so will the charger. The problem is you never know when your battery is about to go until it is too late and your charger is killed as well. I think I'll cut my losses and try another brand."
1,battery charger,I bought my firestorm 14.4 combo 2 years ago.Then the battery charger burned out. I bought two more ps180 battery chargers for my ps140 batteries. I plugged the batteries in the chargers and within 15 min the chargers burned out.I recommend no one buy a black and decker product because of this battery charger problem.
3,Earrings,"I bought these for my granddaughter and I was surprised on just hownice they were for the money, only thing is I'm worried the posts may be a little weak if your not careful using them."
3,Fun alone but don't look for it to connect with Pixel Chix houses,My 9 year old bought this item with birthday money hoping it would interact with her pixel chix miami loft. It didn't. It didn't really do anything other than act like a standalone car. We probably would have had more fun with another Pixel Chix house.
3,Fun but Flakey,The Pixel Chix toys are such a great idea and my daughter loves them but they are all flakey in the extreme. First we purchased a house which got fatal black screen and died. Exchanged that for another which did the same. Finally got lucky 3rd try and bought the car to plug in with her house. But when we connected them there was no interaction with the girl in the house at all. Another frustrating disappointment!
5,5 Stars because......,"Not only is this machine great, it is easy to thread and use but above all I learned that Simplicity has wonderful customer support for any questions or problems that you may encounter, (which I could not get thru Brother,viking or Janome when I bought their machines)They answered my emails the next day and once within 24 hours and I was up and running with my serger from a total beginner to a confident serging maniac!You do not have to spend $1000's for a machine as sales people would have you beleive this does all that a most expensive machine does for a fifth of the price and I am happy I got it and saved myself a bundle."
4,Watch it! It's great!,"Wonderful sequel to The Borrowers. It's true that it doesn't stick faithfully to Mary Norton's books, but it's still close enough to make the movie interesting and delightful to watch. The actors are all fabulous especially Rebecca Callard as Arrietty and Daniel Newman as Spiller (wonder what they are doing now and what else they've done?). Highly recommended for both adults and kids; you will not be bored. The only problem is the quality of the tape really really sucks - which is really too bad. I truly hope they will come out with a DVD version soon."
3,return,I must say that the Return of the Borrowers was not as charming and entertaining as the original one. Overall it was still worth watching. The main thing that I was upset by is the script didn't stick closely enough to the original books it was suppose to be based on. I know it can be pretty hard trying to cram 2 or 3 books into one movie but I think with a little more imagination it could have been done better.
2,Should be renamed --MIDP and JDBC :The Complete Reference,"This book should be retitled as MIDPand JDBC:The complete reference. It is in NO way a complete reference for J2ME.If you are looking a book on using the MIDP profile, this is as comprehensive as a book can get.It has complete code listings to explain each concept and has extensive coverage of the MIDP API's.J2ME also consists of CDC profile that is used to write J2ME applications for wireless devices that are NOT memory constrained. When one clainms that they are creating a complete reference for J2ME, they cannot leave out CDC. This book does not even devote 1 chapter to explain CDC which is such a crucial part of J2ME. Instead the author wastes space and piles on chapters by explaining JDBC and web services.Buy this book if you want to learn only MIDP, else this one is not for you."
2,"Multiple Errors, wasted space and no help from the publisher","Skip the first 50 pages, they have just about nothing to do with the rest of the book. I want to know about J2ME, not about satallites orbiting the earth.There were several small errors throughout, source code missing things here and there. But as I got deeper into the book I didn't know enough about the language to correct the errors. That's what I purchased the book for.Instead I went to Osborne's website where they have the source code for the book (with errors intact) but otherwise don't acknowledge that the book exists. It would have been nice to have an ""updates"" section where a couple of the errors were corrected. At least run the source code before you put it in the book. I'm pretty disappointed."
1,Completely useless book,"J2Me book should atleast make you feel the "" little ness""of the platform you are writing to. No where does thisbook even hint at the severe and extreme constraints involvedin writing for this platform. Issues with UI display,threading issues, problems with RMS persistence .Man! talking about persistence, this author would make youfeel that you are gonna use full fledged SQL 92 compliantdatabase.No limits to my frustration for having spent my moneyon this book; equivalently, I could have dumped intoa garbage bin. Totally irresponsible of the author!"
5,Solid Presentation of J2ME,"This book really gets to the core of J2ME. Keogh writes with a no-nonsense, down to business style that gets right to the heart of the topic. He covers all the different parts of J2ME. Along the way he points out opportunities for optimization and how to access built-in calendars, address and to do list databases. You'll find J2ME, The Complete Reference a valuable addition to your library because it contains practical information that you won't find anywhere on the Internet."
1,Disappointing,"The way this book has been written about and the reviews surrounding it are quite ambiguous and misleading to the point of fury. I was quite surprised by how much this book lacks and fails to achieve for a reader who wants to venture and discover philosophy even at a low level, I suggest to not buy this book."
5,Good Read,"Very good intro to Philosophy. I enjoyed this read very much. I used this book for my 1st college philosophy class, I learned a lot."
2,Disappointed,"I bought the paperback version of this book for an introductory philosophy course. The book's prose is clear and well-written, so I will give the author that much - otherwise, I would have given the book a 1-star. The text is so brief that it is unsatisfying. The author seems to circle around and around questions without offering much except the questions themselves, so he left me with a hollow feeling. He comes across as depressed, particularly his statements that we only matter to ourselves. The book closes with disturbing statements that ""Even if life as a whole is meaningless, perhaps that's nothing to worry about"" and ""Life may be not only meaningless but absurd."" If he feels life is meaningless, why is he teaching philosophy? In the end, he came across as ill and living without hope or meaning. I can't buy into a viewpoint like that."
3,I thought it was simple enough,"Well, I had to read this book for my Philosophy of Management Class (postgraduate course); I am not familiar with philosophy and I was actually too worried that this book is thin yet full of complixity, you know being a philosophy book.Also, I was concerned with the fact that it is an ""old"". However, I was quite wrong, this book is easygoing and a joy to read and I do not think it is possible that it gets out dated. So, I am glad that I had to read it and I look forward to reading the rest of my assigned books.I actually liked the author's style, I like how he expresses his own view and allows you to think and consider your own aside from his influence, so you actually read and think at the same time.Enjoy reading it"
4,great mag for the curious,"I have been reading this magazine for more than 30 years. It was much better when it came as a short weekly. The new longer bi-weekly version is more difficult to read and does not hold my atention like the weekly did. But I continue to subscribbe. It would be great if Amazon could get them to come out with a Kindle version. How about it, Amazon?Gerald N Rohwedder"
5,this game was solid,"it was really really solid as a FPS, even more so for a consolegive us multiplayer and its GG"
2,Disappointed,"I was introduced into XBOX world by playing Halo 2 and liked it. Shortly after I got Call of Duty 3 and LOVED it. Graphics were unreal: smoke, explosions, fire, etc. More importantly you really have to think to survive and win. You have different kit layouts, you can go prone, etc.Anyway, I guess I was really expecting a lot of HALO 3 in terms of both graphics and a little more than ""run around jumping trying to shoot people"". To me HALO3 looks, feels and plays almost identical to HALO2 but i guess I could have seen that coming. Still not sure where all the hype is coming from."
2,Not Good,This Halo game is not near as much fun as Halo 1 or 2. The campaign isn't even a challenge and the online ain't to fun either. This game isn't worth what you have to pay for it. Just get Halo Reach instead!
3,For Kids Only,"The Halo series is a fun group of games if you are 13 or younger. I played the first one and quit after about a third of the way through it. The enemies just look stupid, and it is all very childish in that way. I got Halo 3 because I wanted to give it another shot. While it looks really nice and polished, it still just doesn't do it for me. The multiplayer has so many different game types that you spend half of your time in the lobby. The positives are that the storyline is interesting, and it allows two players for everything. Being able to play online with a friend sitting next to you is a nice feature. I can't believe more games don't have that ability. If you are a member of some thing where you can rent games and not incur late fees, then I recommend just renting this game for a while. Otherwise wait and buy a used version. If you're a teenager or younger, buy this game."
2,Halo3 - Halo's Greatest Hits Vol. I,"As expected with a greatest hits compilation, you get everything that made Halo 1 and Halo 2 fun. Thats the problem with Halo 3 - its a rehash and nothing more. The real game play is in the multiplayer but when one buys the game it should equally divided or close to it with the solo campaign being just as strong. The story is very weak and lacks consistency with Halo 1, not to mention some pretty lame attempts to link the series (Why would the index from Halo 1 work with a new Halo?). Anyway, this is a game that definitely deserves a rental or a borrow but not a buy. I bought it, and I'll let my buddy borrow it, then I'll return it. Sorry Microsoft, the hype machine never met the end result despite your best efforts."
4,The end of an era,"Well Halo 3 finally ends the Halo story. This was a pretty good series, is it Gears of War no but still pretty good. This game was actually somewhat difficult, the aliens were smarter unlike your some of sqaud mates, the environments looked/sounded great. Your A.I companions didn't repeat themeselves much unless you were redoing a mission. The new weapons and equipment were good who doesn't love setting aliens on fire. Although up until you find cortana she'll interupt you during missions by slowing game play, it's still alien killing fun."
2,Plagued by Disc Read Errors,"I am on my third copy of Halo 3 Standard edition, all of which randomly give me Disc Read Errors. So far I have been completely unable to progress past the Cortana stage. My last attempt to replace the disc through Amazon resulted in this reply..""Thank you for writing to us at Amazon.com.I'm sorry to hear that you experienced the same problem with your replacement shipment.As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement.We will gladly refund you in full for the return of this item. If the item was part of a set, please return the entire set.""Save your money until Microsoft has figured this issue out."
2,SUPER FUN! For about 13 minutes until you cry in your sleep.,"No matter what, if you have a 360 and don't own Halo 3, buy a mac and don't ever play another game ever again.But if you do own a 360 and might be thinking about buying Halo 3, don't- Just rent it. This is by far the most linear and boring Halo in the series. At times will you want to finish a level for the sake of getting on with the story and not the actual game.If you do buy this game, do yourself a favor, skip the campaign and go straight to multiplayer.If you don't have Live...well then you sir are screwed."
3,It was a gift,I bought the game with the system as a birthday gift. My fiance and his friend beat the game in one night and haven't touched it since. It's been a year and a half....
4,Good game but way too short,"This was my first time into the Halo universe and it has great visuals and a good story but the single player mode was way too short.I recommend the game but I felt that I was just being rushed into getting the basics down and then obviously they wanted you to jump into Xbox live with it, I just wanted a longer more in depth story.I finished the game in less than a week on and off."
5,HALO,Excellent game of action....The game halo is very interesting...The graphics is very cool and amazing... I like this game...
5,I never played halo before,"but now i'm a big fan, I never used an x-box neither, they are just ok, I preffer my PS3, but still, halo was a lot of fun"
5,Awesome experience,The company that sold us this game is a small business and locally run. I was very impressed with the expediency of the shipment. They also included a hand written note expressing their thanks for using them which I found very impressive in today's automated world! I would definitely recommend this company when purchasing in the future.
5,so awesome!,Finished the game in a day. The game is so amazing. I especially love the music and how in depth the storyline is. Definately glad i bought it.
4,Pretty good...,"I played Halo 1 and 2 long ago on the original XBox, but recently upgraded to an XBox 360. I know this game is a bit old now, but it is quite enjoyable. Especially at the price its going for."
3,Fun game; but not our HALO favorite.,"Personally, 'enjoy ODST and, to a slightly lesser extent, Reach more. None the less, 'still a fun game!I hope the HALO saga continues post-Bungie!"
4,about buying used cd,"that will be the last time i purchase a used game online for sure. for now on its new or nothing , the seller said it was in very good shape and it wont play past half way through a campaine but my son is happy it works online so i guess as long as he happy it will do. i hate giving a bad review of a seller but i rather say the truth."
5,good game,"first off, i'd like to say that i never played halo or halo 2 before, so i am not one of those halo supernerds. Still, this is the best game i've ever played. i just don't get why people complain about how tough the enemies are. try thinking about this, YOU SUCK!!! i liked the game alot, but i think that it isn't going to be as good as some stuff that bungie will put out in the future. even though i gave it 5 stars, i still am wondering why people were saying it was going to be perfect. ya i like the game, but still, i've played better. this is all coming from a ""dumb jock"" gamer, and i still had no huge trouble with any of the levels. the best thing about the game is it's AMAZING AI. if a game doesn't have good AI, i wouldn't play it. i felt like the ending of the game really set it up for HALO 4."
4,"Solid single player, excellent multiplayer, as expected","I didn't really buy into the hype for Halo 3, and I got exactly what I expected. It's a solid shooter with a well-designed single-player campaign, and incredible depth to the multiplayer system, but overall, nothing to write home about. It's well worth the money if you like playing online, and especially if you have friends who play it. It's worth the money, but missable, if you're only intending to play the single player campaign."
4,The Fight,"Man, I love the Halo trilogy as a whole. I was a little disappointed with Halo 2, but H3 more than makes up for it. Only major beef is that the campaign is only 6 hours long. The multiple difficulty and online cooperative levels add some replay value. The multiplayer is superb, if only they would find a way to get different type of matches into rotation."
1,Huge let down,"I honestly thought that Halo 3 would make me a believer, but it didnt. I played the first one and hated it. Played the second one and hated it; then I played the third installment and hated it even more. The campaign sucks. It is incredibly easy to pass and online sucks even more. I really don't see what people talk about. I don't see the magic. The guns feel weak and toy like. Perhaps what annoys me the most are the 12 year old kids that skip school to play. Rented and try it out. You might like it more than I did."
1,BORING,This game is sooo boring and the same as HALO 1 and 2 .. i think this game si like DOOM with a new skin!
3,A lot of Hype for nothing,"The game over all is an alright game, Graphic wise its lovely, Story is brilliant, I recommend this game to all those run and gunners out there as there is no tactics involved what so ever. One of them games once you complete you just put on your desk to gather dust."
4,Pretty Good,"I like this game. its fun but dosent seem to be as good as the original halo, but it is better than part 2. the graphics are really good and they are gorgeous. the lighting effects in the game is also really good in the game. i like the music and how they kept the original music from the first halo. the game dosent seem to have that much humor in it if any like the original did but its okay. what i always liked about the halo series is the fact that you will jump straight into combat. no need to figure out puzzles or anything like that. just straight combat. im not big into video games that much any more like i used to be. this game came out in 2007 and i am just now playing it for the very first time. i dont buy games for [...]bucks. i like to wait til the price is [...] bucks or less then i'll grab the game or i will trade in my old games for it."
2,Good!!!,"The game did not work, I had to copy another hard drive and use that to play, good condition but malfunction, I imagine it was bad luck I hope the others work well"
3,dissapointed,"The seller didn't say it did not come with the original case, it came with a music cd case!!"
5,Halo 3,"I waited this long to finally get this game that everyone has. I've played it before, played a lot of the other two Halos. I purposely waited til now because the price was so good, even better than buying it used at GameStop.I received this Halo3 very quickly, it was a very good price, the disk wasn't scratched or damaged, it also came with the manual to the game in very good condition, and even came with a small Halo 3 poster that came with the game when it first came out (which I wasn't even expecting to get).This buy was a great buy and I would buy from this seller again."
5,"Great Game Overall, Halo 4? Halo Movie?","Halo 3 was a great game and has a great multiplayer experience but does the legendary ending mean halo 4, a new book, expansion, or even a movie, but the campaign was awesome and was very fun so i give it 5 stars"
2,Halo 3...Hmph. Just like halo 1 only better graphics,"Go out and buy this game now!!! That is if you want to play the same boring style single player missions that the previous Halo releases offered as well. Other than better graphics this game is a pitiful excuse of a shooter. The only good in Halo titles is the fact that every kids mommy buys it for him for christmas/birthday, which means more online players. Other than that, Unreal 3 (or any unreal for that matter) is worlds better than these titles. They offer more characters, better weapons, more manuverability, comparable graphics, and tons more unlockables. So if you are a die hard Halo fan, by all means waste your money on this game, however if you are in for some balls to the wall, blood filled FPS action, please do me a favor and support Epic games. Buy Unreal 3!!!"
2,hello,nothin new here just slightly better graphics but its the same old stuff here no new enemies samt brutes same flood and covenant screw this game there are way better games on the market than halo i bought halo with my xbox 360 and i wish i had gotten a different game i have it sitin there it been weeks since ive played it. go waiste your money on something els people or just save it up for metal gear solid 4 buy problably is another piece of crap they are makin crappy games lately
4,Halo 2 + 1,"It's good, but it's a small incremental improvement over Halo 2. The graphics look almost the same as Halo 2. I expected better graphics and a feeling similar to the first time I played Halo 1 where I couldn't stop saying WOW! So overall, I'm a little disappointed. Regardless, it's a good game, and I think most people will enjoy it after the slow start."
2,It's well....ok,"I'm sorry I do enjoy shooters and I have bought all of the Halo games....but I need something more. New Shooters now are way beyond Halo 3. The graphics are better, the story is better, the AI is better, the games mechanics are better, and the online multi-player is BETTER!!! Come on...no new maps only refurbished old ones...it's like halo 2 but just better graphics. If I want to play Halo 2 I'd just play it. The only thing this has is the ability to take a guest online with you but those other...BETTER games are catching up to that one. I really expected more from the great Halo name. But when is comes down to it who really freaking cares.If you want this game wait a year it'll reach Platinum status and you can buy it for $20...hype sells all."
3,Halo 3,Good game.Just a little short but a good ending.I do admit that I dont use the game on XBOX LIVE that much.I give it only 3 stars because of the $59 price when it first was released and the solo game was rushed.
2,Could have been better,"I expected more from this game. Yes, or course, the graphics are improved. Other than that, it's a bit of a let-down. Played it this morning for over an hour at a friend's house and have no real urge to go back to it."
1,Nice to see microsoft cutting loose the people who bought the first console,"I bought the first Halo and the second Halo. Now if I want the third Halo, I have to throw away the entire console and buy the 360 for $400+tax, then new controllers, etc. Thanks Microsoft for making the game exclusive for the 360 and cutting loose all the people who bought your products in the past."
1,this game is terrible,I didn't like anything about this game. Looks exactly like halo on old xbox. Nothing compared to the new games on 360.
5,This game is fun!,Played this at a friends house and it's great. As soon as I get my flashing red lights hardware problem fixed this game will be spinning for hours.
1,Meh,"A friend of mine gave me this game for free.That was still too much to pay for this boring shooter. Feels like playing tribes, only not as fun. How on earth did the halo franchise get so popular?"
2,So-So,"Graphics are great. Ive only played a few hours, appears Gameplay similar too, if not exact to halo 2. Same weapons, same enemies over and over again.....Gripe.....HOw lame not being able to hide and duck behind cover like you can in Gears of War or ghost reocon. Last I checked this was 2007 not 1999."
3,HALO OVERHYPED,"This game was too over hyped plus sound effects for the weapon was weak,graphics was not up to 360 standard bungie the guys who made this game got LAZY and gives us a half a$$ game.Those who gives this game more than 3 stars are not true gamers and they dont now what is good for what isnt there just wanabe gamers."
1,Not their best,"The campaign to start is confusing. Even when you get the hang of it it sucks. Online is stupid. You don't know when a grenade is near and it is overpowered. For gunfight, it is dull and simple. If u shoot first you one the fight. If you have a rocket launcher you won the game, same with sword. Save your money and buy a better game."
1,overrated,"This game is a big let down the campaign is good but from day one online sucks tons of hackers and cheaters bungie has done nothing but lie about this game ive played over 1,000 games and over half of them ive met hackers and cheaters more and more every day I recommend buying call of duty 4 or rainbow six vegas the graphics are no better than any other game all i have to say is that epic games is way better than bungie"
1,"Terrible, Boring, Lame, Don't Waste Your Time","Haven't we done this before? The maps look the same, the weapons are boring, and the characters are, once again silly. This game reminds me of the disappointment I felt while watching the new Star Wars movies. Characters or childish, and the plot is entirely un-inventive. Save $60 and play Halo 2 again."
2,This was the big deal,Ok frist of all I would like my money back. This was just to fast of a game. Ok it looks great and plays great but man it took me long to bet the other Halo games. Look this game is not all that. I think they blew it with this one.
3,This is the Flagship of the X360?,"Not a bad game, decent graphics average sound. The solo campaign is enjoyable. Controls are difficult as it is hard to switch to auxillary weapons etc. Multiplayer is confusing and not much fun. I can't believe this is the flagship of microsoft though. It seams like not much effort was put into the game and that Microsoft just relied on the Halo name brand. Not a bad game but no where no the hype level produced by it. At least its the end of the series..."
2,Lazy Bungie,"I was a big fan of the HALO series, very big fan, i remember when i first bought the game it was amazing to me, until i went online and played xbox live,i dont know what bungie was thinking when they made this point system nonsense and the lag and unfairness of this system really makes me think that HALO 3 was created by a bunch of lazy pigs, ( BUNGIE ) I PLAY CALL OF DUTY 4 everyday now, I put down halo 3 cause i should have fun playing games, not getting stressed all of the time. BY FAR COD 4 is much more entertaining than HALO 3. besides the graphics in HALO 3 are sub par, and represents laziness on the part of BUNGIE. I might sell my copy for about 10 bucks."
3,nothing special,"I'm not a Halo fan since i haven't played halo 1 or 2 campaign or multiplayer that much. I got Halo 3 cause it seemed like it would be the one that would be worth it. I haven't completed the campaign yet, but so far, it hasn't impressed me too much. It isn't anything special or revolutionary. The game play hasn't offerend anything unique that i have noticed (though i like the vehicles). I think Gears of War brought more fun idea's to the table than this game did.It's pretty much just a ""running around and shooting things"" game in a shiny new skin. I'm sure the halo fans and the multiplayer fanatics will find more interest in this game than i did. To each his own.Considering this is supposed to be Microsofts ""flagship"" game for the xbox, i expected more. This game is way more hype than follow through. However, i do enjoy it and dont regret buying it. It's worth owning imo."
2,meh (shrugs shoulders),Less then the first and the second and the second was just alright. I only played this game to see the end of the story which to put it bluntly sucked bungie really blew their load on the first halo.
5,The best Halo ever,"Halo is a great franchise and everyone knows that. This game raises the bar for first person shooters for me. Sometimes I can't see why people don't like this game. It is so good. Online will never get old and campaign is good. I liked Halo ce better but it was better than Halo 2. The new weapons they have are SWEET. The assault rifle, gravity hammer, and the mongoose and hornet vehicles. This game is so good and the only complaint I have is that the energy sword's reticle is still to close but that doesn't ruin the game. Also the spartan laser which is a laser that, if held down will destroy anything."
4,Halo.....it is worth the wait to complete the trilogy,"I was able to get a copy from circuit city last night and stayed all night with a pot of coffee to keep me from wavering as i was ready, set and going forward. Just now i have stop to post here what i think of it thus far....WOW is the word that came out of my mouth time and time again as i was playing this game. Playing on my HDTV with the lights off and the sound up, it just doesn't get any better than this. Now i have played both Halo 1 and 2, and this one is much better in every way other then the campaign which the first one still hold as king but graphic wise, this one takes the cake. Those who don't like this game just don't understand what Halo means and will never understand it. You know what, forget it....i'm going back and continue where i left off because i want to see how long it take me to complete this thing so i'll finish this review once i'm done. Take care and let's Halo!"
5,Halo 3 review,I bought this game for my son and he and his friends love it. They play it online and in person. Thank you for getting it to us quickly!
4,what can I say its halo?,The game was about what I was expecting. Though the game it self is pretty short the mulitplayer aspect of the game is great. All in all its a game worth the money and worth the hype.
5,Halo 3,This game is very fun. I received the game quickly and had it running in no time. This was a great purchase.
3,Warming Up,"I wasn't a very big fan of the earlier Halo games, but my brother pestered me into buying this for him. It's actually more interesting than I thought it would be. Game play isn't too difficult and the graphics are pretty intense. It's definitely easy to say that I'm warming up to the series."
5,Awesome game,"Even though this game is old, it is a great game, the best of the halo series in my opinion, fun campaign play, and I have spent hours and hours playing multilayer, out of all the call of duty, and gears of war, and other online games this is my favorite, and I do know those games, I played every single one religiously when they were released. I dominate in all of them."
4,"Not blown away, but good addition to the series and a must own","I wasn't blown away, the story line is poor, in my opinion, but the multi-player interface is nice and controls are well done."
3,overhyped...multiplayer saved it for me,"I played halo 1 AFTER I played halo 3, and I liked halo 1 much better. It has a more serious tone. In halo 3, the enemies you are fighting sound silly as they talk. I felt almost embarassed as it sounded like I was watching a childish saturday morning cartoon. Halo 1 doesn't have this, and the music is much, much better in halo 1, it gave me goosebumps.The graphics aren't even much of a improvement either. Games like COD 4 make this look stale.The only reason why I still play this is because it's splitscreen online multiplayer. That means a friend of yours can play with you as you battle online with other people. I wish more games supported this."
2,Its all right,In my opionon the game is not all that good . Its is a big let down for those who waited at the doors for it to come out. I mean people who have played Halo2 didnt really miss anything cause everything is the same. Except the stages suck and online is full of five year olds cussing thier mothes off.And achievments are so easy thats the only reason i played it for a week.
2,run of the mill,"halo is by no means a bad game, its simply just run of the mill. basically its a ww2 game with an aliens theme. If your a sci-fi lover than this is for you but i like realism a lot and the idea of a whole clip to kill an alien doesn't float my boat. on the bright side this is the best executed multiplayer on the 360, but when you dont like the game execution means nothing. this is a good game but if you like realism rent it before you buy it if your a sci fi addict than why arent you playing this already?"
2,halo 3,"Many people liked this game. i myself didnt see the attraction. i thought the graphics were average at best. probably should have been put out on ps3 for better graphics. that said, if you are a big 1st person shooter fan, which im not, then you should be satisfied with this game because it did have a fair amount of action"
4,"Brilliant graphics, smooth gameplay, awesome on-line","Though the game isn't perfect, it is a brilliant addition to a very popular title. Graphics are gorgeous and fluid, controls are smooth, the difficulty settings get challenging on ""Hard"" and ""Legendary"". The new vehicles and weapons are also very enjoyable. The new ""device"" use is also a nice addition.My only complaints are minimal and minor annoyances: in game, you hear voices which slows things to a crawl as your mind hears them...I didn't understand why they chose that effect. The other is that you can't save multiple ""solo"" games...do developers realize that more than one person can play an X-box 360 in a single household?"
3,not that fun,"maybe its just me, but i found halo 3 to be a little cheesey and weird. keep in mind that i have not played the other 2. alot of the weapons were lame and half the time, i couldnt see where i was in the game. much of it is darkly lit or hard to see. overall, there are better shoot-'em-up games out there."
5,BEST GAME EVER,YOU HAVE TO GET THIS GAME!!!! it has the best online play. you can customize your Spartan or Elite. and just amazing graphics! GET THIS GAME!!!
4,Halo 3 rules,"Halo 3 has a great interface for the first person shooter. My only complaint is that it could have more levels. However, if you bump it up to the harder stages it is truly a masterpiece."
4,GOT TO HAVE,the game is great. the oline play is the best.you dont buy this game for the gameplay you buy this for the online play the worlds are great and fun. you will love to play this game.go for it
4,Don't play campaign before finishing the solo mission,This game is great. Just don't try any campaign mode until you finish the solo single player mission. I was half way and lost all save games. I am starting over again. Not saying it is not fun but that is the only problem I see so far. Other than that this is a perfect addition to the Halo franchise. ODST is pretty good too.
1,This is the most over rated game I have ever bought!,I played this game before..... its called Unreal Tournament 2004.... and the graphics were better back then !This game is all hype ! it brings NOTHING NEW to the xbox 360 ! I mean nothing. Graphics a weak - not even hd... they are upscaled. the multiplayer sucks big time... its so hard to find a match that you want to play.. horrible over all game... if this game was not called Halo it would get no love at all. Bungie sat on their hands and brought nothing to the table... Gears of war raised the bar so high that they cannot even compete ...At least Unreal 3 is coming which will be what Halo should have been.....Buy it in the used bin because a lot of people will be trading this ' dog ' in because it has fleas.
3,A bit disappointing...,"I must say that I am rather let down by the look of Halo 3. I have been playing both Call Of Duty 4 Demo and Bioshock for a while now, and expected the same crisp lines and detail level from this title. It's just not there. This game looks like Quake to me, very cartoonish and rough. The animations of the non-player characters are very, very stiff. I should state that I have never played the previous Halo titles before, and purchased this game on the wave of pre-release chatter, so might not understand the established look and feel of the game environments.All in all a bit of a let down, I am sad to say.For the record, I have a Panasonic 52"" HDTV with superb detail, and other 360 games look great."
1,ALL BARK NO BITE,I GOT THE GAME IN THE MAIL THE WEDNESDAY OF ITS RELEASE DATE AND BY FRIDAY I BEAT IT AND THE LAST TIME I PLAYED IT.
1,Very Bad...,"I got this game after listening to everyone say how great it is, and after my experience with Halo 2, which was ok. This game is basically very stupid, because all you do is jump around all day, and you can't zoom in on a lot of guns, shooting at midget things. Basically OK graphics, OK online, and the hammer is just plain gay. Overall, don't get this game, there are MUCH better games out there, don't waste your time and buy into the fan base hype. Use your money wisely and get something useful."
2,Thanks Microsoft,"Well I would like to say is that Halo speaks for itself. Untill you roll through the single player game in about 6 hours. I understand that Halo is online multiplayer at it finest but some of us would prefer a little more story. Basicly I would like to thank MS for not putting a HD-DVD drive in the 360 Elite so our games keep their wonderfully short gameplay. Unfortunately 8Gb of storage just dosent cut it for HD games nowadays. (Here come the fanboys, let me have it) But seriously I just purchased an Elite and though it may contain the 65nM chipset the lack of a HD-DVD drive and HD-DVD game support makes my nice pretty console a Halo rig and nothing more."
3,THIS SUCKS BIG TIME!!!!!,Just like halo 2 halo 3 sucks!!! for almost 60 buck the game needs to be longer. It took a day and a half to finish it. WTF???? I feel cheated!
3,BETTER THAN GEARS??? I think NOT!!!!!!!!!!,ok first off the game was good story sucked but game was good. the mulitplayer was alright except for shotty snipers honestly who plays that. anyways i read through and earlier saw that some one said that this game is better than gears .... i will ask that you bite your tongue. nothing compares to gears not even almighty HALO sorry to dissapoint you hardcore HALO nerds but gears owns halo every which way you look at it. plus i get bored of halo online i never get tired of gears. so shut it!! im through.
2,Good if I could play it,Loved Halo 1 & 2. Bought this off Amazon marketplace and its acting glitchy or something. Checkpoints do not load after dying and instead I'm sent back to the very beginning of the mission. Also when I finally get to the end of the mission it reverts back to the beginning again. The only way to make progress I found out is to save the game after reaching a checkpoint and then loading from a fresh restart of the game in order to resume where I left off. Totally ridiculous and can't find any help online. Gameplay is ruined no matter how cool the game is.
5,xbox classic,"received product but found that it did not work on xbox classic. very nice in letting me return product for another game to work on xbox classic and grandson says it is ""awesome"". very happy with experience and would purchased from them again.thank you"
5,Halo Is everything,I got reg. Halo an halo 2 for my boy and he is go gun ho on these games. I can't believe how much he likes them..Now he has 3 you can't stop him playing just them.
4,I finished the fight!,"Well it's finally here, and I must say, its all that I expected and more.Here's a quick rundown...Graphics 4/5, definatly top notch, but the 360 can do betterSound 5/5, will full dolby surround, it sounds like a movie. Best I've here on a consoleStory 3.5/5 pretty short story mode, however its a very good story with plenty of ooo and ahhh momentsMultiplayer 6/5 multiplayer is where this game stands out, it has a very organized party system which makes it easy to get with friends, 4 player co-op over live is a blast, and sharing screenshots and videos is alot easier and cooler than other games.All in all 4.5/5...Try or Buy? Definatly buy, you can't go wrong with Halo"
3,Just OK,"I didn't play the original Halos, so I don't feel like I'm going to come at this game with a predetermined bias. Comparing the game to others I have played on the 360 (Gears, Prey, Call of Duty 2/3, Bioshock) I would compare the overall experience most closely with Call of Duty 3) and based on the pre-release hype, this is a dissapointment. The game has nice graphics, but this game plays pretty much like a typical run and gun. No innovations that I noticed beyond what COD3 brings to the table. On-line play may be better, but for those who play predominantly single player campaigns, I would defintitely recommend Gears, Bioshock and even Prey as a substantially better overall experience. If you are a single campaigner, I would defintely rent first, because to me, this game is not a must buy."
3,Fun Game but Single Player Mode was a Little Disapointing.,"Fans of the Halo series will buy it and enjoy it. My main gripe was in the single player mode. It is so short! The game was completed in about 10 hours, which in my opinion, is very poor. Other than that the game is a winner. BTW I bought this for my 14 year old and he will play with friends and online for many more hours. The M rating didn't bother me as I had seen the other Halo games. It's a war game so death is an integral part. Killing evil space aliens instead of humans is much easier to deal with.So go and get yourself Halo 3. It is definately fun to play."
2,Why bother?,"I played Halo and loved it. I played Halo 2 and kind of enjoyed it. I skipped Halo 3 and went right to Halo: ODST and enjoyed that. Now, I finally came back to Halo 3 and all I have to say is ""What a snooze-fest!"" I was dismayed at the boring levels that frequently gave no indication as to where you needed to go. I was perplexed by the ""who cares?"" plot line that seemed to only be created in order to make further use of the Flood (which are really annoying as far as video game zombies are concerned). I only finished the game so that I could get it over with and learn how the trilogy of games concludes, as each level of Halo 3 was less and less compelling than the previous one and some of the Flood levels were downright incomprehensible as to where to go and what to do. To be sure, I liked ODST and play the Firefight mode with friends all the time. But this game is about as exciting as Pariah was for the old Xbox. Fair warning!"
3,Game Lacks Meaningful Story,"Your character is built like a tank, accordingly, skill and strategy are not a game play requirement. Without having played Halo, and Halo 2 I have found the story line a little confusing. The game has good graphics, however, the adversaries in the game are a little bizarre. A lot of time an energy went into making the game graphically appealing, however, the storyline is lacking. The story becomes so disconnected from any contemporary context (or meaningful view of the future), that really in the end there is nothing more to gain from the game then shotting some strange little alien monsters with purple blood."
3,Oh well.....,"The single player campaign is a disappointment. Single player is terribly short and uninspired. No city boards; what's up with that!?! Are the enemies square dancing or is that really the AI? Is Cortana on Crack!?! Where is this fight happening again, because I couldn't tell; 'Earth', the 'moon', 'Neptune'? The campaign felt like an after thought so attentions could be focused on the 'money making' online multi-player experience.This game definitely deserves kudos for the graphical shoe polish, and online multi-player experience. Still, lone wolf fans of the Halo trilogy single player campaign may want to lower their expectations. Consider trying before buying."
2,Not all its hyped up to be!,"to be blunt, this game sucks balls! The weapons are awful and the graphics are ok. The worst part of the game is you can't run, and the sights on the guns lack any control! The campain was fun for the first few hours, after that its all the same and gets boring fast. If you want a good game, go with call of duty 4! I havnt put it down since i got it."
5,haha awesome,"Hands down best halo so far, who ever doesn't like this game probably is not very good at it, (dude I shot you so many times and you didn't die, this game is stupid I'm gonna go cry about it online). Multiplayer is flawless, graphics are great, sound is excellent. What more do you need than hours of killing each other online. So in conclusion, we all know a great game when we see one, don't believe the babies."
3,Deja Vu all over again,"For all the hype this game really dissappointed me. I'm glad that I borrowed it from a friend. If I had to drop $60 on this game I would have been furious at the Bungie.Campaign mode is just like the first two Halo games. Which isn't really a bad thing, but something a bit different might have helped. In the end the single player mode felt rushed as if it were an afterthought.Online is fun at first, but really doesn't do anything that was done before. Maps are still too small and the Halo community is still as immature as they were with the second Halo on Live. Halo has an online shooter full of more drama queens (look at me I'm ranked #1 because I play Halo 16 hours a day), sore losers (screamers and proclaim everybody that beats them ""cheaters""), and racist/profanity laced language than I have experienced in any other FPS online shooter.I'll stick to my Half Life and Counterstrike to get my FPS fix for now."
2,big letdown,the game is ok like most others i dont believe it lives up to the hype if you like playing the campaign get it to see how it ends but if you are getting it for multiplayer save your money and keep playing halo2 the graphics look pretty much the same as halo 2 even in HD keeping it short i wouldnt reccomend this game just keep playing #2
1,why returned,"Even though advertised as such, game was not compatible with Xbox 360 format. Required installation of hard drive. Forget it! would have kept it otherwise. Any suggestions?"
5,best game ever!,"better than any game, fun lasts so long. had it for 3 years now, use it a lot. popularity on servers multilayer has gone done, but still best multilayer live and on counsel 4 player. in my opinion better than reach."
2,Kind of disappointing...,"Ah, crap... I've been waiting for this title for years, and all I got was a SHORT rehash of Halo 1 & 2. Not much new here. Gameplay was easy and repetitive and there wasn't a decent story arc.My main problem is with the length of the single person campaign. I finished the thing in under 10 hours of gameplay. Come on, Microsoft! Not all of us want XBox live, and I don't appreciate getting pushed into getting it. Just give me a decent game that I can sit and play for a few hours."
3,Doesnt Run at 720p,"The game while great and visually stunning does not run at 720p, but at 640p. This was a non issue till the scalar chip in my zephyr (with hdmi) xbox 360 failed.Apparrently playing halo 3 caused my HANA chip to die. That's too bad because other wise the resolution doesnt matter, the game is beautiful.This is something to keep in mind if you have a new revision xbox 360. My 360 was 1 month old with less than 140 hours of play time (100 for oblivion, some hours on the dashboard and some more for halo 3)."
2,Garbage!!!,If you a hardcore HALO 1 fan like I am am you will not enjoy this. Most of the reviews are right saying that this game is geared for online play. I was blown away by Halo 1 and I still play it. All the halo's are good I guess for playing with your friends and talking smack ofterwards I guess but they have changed the game so much from HALO 1 gameplay that they should have gave it a different name. All in all I bought this game..beat it on the hardest setting and sold it. Not worth it in my opinion. The graphics are the same if not worse then the previous Halo's. So I dont see why they didnt put it out on regular xbox too. Thanks for reading.
4,"Same gamplay as first 2 games, but better graphics","This is an awesome game...Don't get me wrong, but it is the same as the first two Halo games.The graphics have improved a lot, but it isn't the best out there.The campaign mode isn't that good, and there is still a lot of backtracking in the 9 levels of campaign mode, but you can play over Xbox Live with your friends in 4 player co-op.Where this game really shines(Like the previous games) is the multiplayer.It has the same modes as the previous games, with some new levels,weapons,and characters.You can watch videos of the games you play, and send them to your friends. The videos take up a small amount of space, which is nice.You might not want to get this game, because with so many people already playing, the game lags, and it isn't as fun.Overall, this is a worthy game to add to a 360 collection, but you might want to wait a while to buy it."
2,They keep getting worse...,"The first halo was amazing, the second halo was good, and now halo 3. Halo 3 is way too overhyped in my opinion, it's not really any different than halo 2. You can use new items, and that's about it. the graphics are pretty good, but definetely not the best. If you were unimpressed by the lack of innovation in Halo 2, you'll be even more disappointed in H3."
3,ehh...its ok,"The story mode was pretty cool, but way to short. Took me 3 hours on normal to beat it. The 4 player coop was fun, but you have to put a party together yourself, which is just stupid. The multiplayer was cool. Way to many glitches though. Save 60 dollars and wait for the price to come down, or, at least, buy it used and save a few bucks. Not worth 60. Not even close. Have a good one."
5,Get this game.,"Jaw dropping hi-def visual effects, amazing game-play, jacked up AI for the hardcore legendary players, the epic multiplayer that made its predecessor so great improved by hundred fold. This game is the epitome of FPS's. Get it, you won't be disappointed. And get Xbox Live, you literally will be glued for hours if you have the time."
5,Possibly the current best First Person Shooter,"Halo 3 is a great game. If you're a fan of Halo and Halo 2, this game is a must as it wraps up the story started in the other 2. Even if you've never played Halo before it is definitely worth your time. The campaign mode is challenging and you are able to play it cooperatively with friends over Xbox live or split screen. There are also many different multiplayer modes to suit just about anyone's style of play. The visuals are stunning especially in the campaign. The default game controls work well and are easily gotten used to. Music is good. Matchmaking allows your to meet random players and play on random maps and game modes which is always great for a change of pace. Overall it is one of the best shooters of the year."
3,"Very fun, needs more MP levels.","The campaign was mediocre, like most games nowadays. I liked Halo 2's compaign the most of the series.Online multiplayer is fun but it seems ridiculous how much has been left out. There are very, very few levels. Matchmaking selects whatever level it feels like with whatever game it feels like. You basiclaly select basic game type that thats it, save for custom games, which no one seems to play.It needs more levels and more guns in multiplayer. There's so much stuff in the campaign that just isn't used in multiplayer. They new MP was going to be huge, why did they put such little effort into it?I'm not really a COD4 fanboy. (I don't even own it) I actually like Halo 3 more, but it seems like all of my friends have gone to playing COD4 all the time, Halo is dying."
4,:0),really don't have much to say but i did enjoy myself and thats what matter. great gaming experirnce for me.
2,Rent it..,"Let see, Run Jump Shoot, That pretty much describes the game.Didn't do a thing for me.. I tryed it,It just didn't rock my boat."
3,Most Overrated Game of the year,"I'm definietly NOT a Halo fanboy, so maybe I don't get it. Pretty straight forward campaign and the maps are just too huge on multiplayer to be any fun for extended periods of time. Graphics are pretty amazing and saves this from being a total loss, but overall this game is way overrated. I don't see what all the fuss is all about - alot of other titles are doing it better and with more style...see Bioshock..."
3,Good game but it still has it's flaws,"I've been playing this game since the day it came out. I must say I was really caught up in the hype. I wasn't a huge Halo 2 fan but I did like Halo 1 a lot. As for #3, I think it's a good game, it can be a lot of fun as well as very frustrating. I don't like the online system much, there's a lot of game modes that are really bad and not fun at all. And YES, you can veto them(by majority rule) but chances are high if you veto one game you will be stuck with the same or worse on the next randomly selected game. As far as campaign mode, I do like it a lot. I think campaign is the highlight of the game."
4,Fun but Short,"This is a fun game, but kind of short. You need to play it if you played the first two, but it is not completely satisfactory conclusion to the series for the campaign. The tournament play is very fun with all the new vehicles."
3,Third installment of Halo is pretty solid,"Well Halo 3 is finally done. The biggest strength of the game is multiplayer, more exact, co-op campaign mode. By far my favorite way to go through a game is with a friend is co-op mode. It adds a lot of value to a game when you can play right along side your friends. Halo 3 however does you one better well two better if you want to get technical, you can co-op with up to 4 people. I was never into Halo or Halo2, so I didn't care about the ""story-line"" but for a game it was pretty damn good. My only complaints would be.....well i guess i don't have any other than the ending was kinda lame. Graphics were beautiful, game-play length was just right, and it has solid replay ability."
1,Overrated to the max!,This is most overrated p.o.s. I have ever played. Nothing about this game is fun at all. This game is a rip-off of a great game Unreal Tournament. Even down to some of the guns and even some the rides are almost the same. Don't get this or any of the halo games because it's a bad rip-off of Unreal Tournament. I don't know what is worse this game or ET.
1,Couldnt tell this was the third,"I bought the first halo, and was not impressed, waited for this game to come out and.... well it almost exactly as the original halo.... I mean seriously, I didnt play the second and hoped this was going to have superb improvements.... If you didnt like other Halo games, this is no saving grace."
1,Seriously?,"Lets take a game, Halo, and remake it and add very little to nothing new, over and over and over and over. It wasn't a fun game to start out with, It's still not a fun game, and chances are it won't ever be a fun game."
1,boring,"this game is so over hyped I picked it up at midnight, I got home and boy was I upset horrible grahics and boring gameplay, this game is dated dont wast your money."
1,WTF???,"This is perhaps the most over hyped game ever. Same old stuff as Halo and Halo 2. I don't know why people fall into the traps laid by microsoft to increase their hardware sales. I played this game the same day I got it and I must say that it is very short. 8 hours the most. The graphics are decent, but not as good as other games on the 360. Multiplayer sucks.........So if you want to save 60 bucks, stick to your old Halos......--ALL YOU HALO FANBOYS OUT THERE PLEASE DO NOT HATE ON THE PS3 FANS COZ YOU GUYS ARE THE SAME--"
3,Sadly Disappointed,"I just picked up my pre-ordered copy today and could'nt wait to come home and play it. It looks and plays almost exactly like Halo 2 for the original Xbox. Graphics are about as good as Far Cry instincts. Not much has changed since Halo 2. It's still a fun game but they hyped it up too much. After 3 years in the making, I expected much more. I'm going to continue to play Gears of War until something better comes along."
3,Casio Men's W42H-AV digital watch,"This watch is made of high quality materials, it is light and good looking. What I did not like about it is the size of the display which is too small. Another problem about it is that when using the stop watch at night time, if you hit the LIGHT button, it will iluminate the display as expected but it will also split the lap, which is undesirable because one will lose track of the total running time. This is a major flaw and I would not buy this watch if I knew it up front. Casio, listen to what your customers say, this is an important improvement that needs to be made. The price is very attractive though."
5,Great Watch - Dirt cheap,I wanted a watch that I could wear golfing or anywhere without worrying about damaging it. This watch is perfect for me. I am wearing it right now. I think I've had it for a year or more now.
4,"Cheap watch, works great","Although this watch does not have the bells and whistles of many other digital watches, it has been a great workout watch for me. It is lightweight and water resistant and easy to use and find the stopwatch. A couple of things I have noticed are that the paint chips a little bit, and while using the stopwatch function if you run in twilight, using the light function also stops your stopwatch! Otherwise, if you are looking for an inexpensive digital watch, you could do worse."
3,Weird set-up,"The watch is simple, yet the way everything is layed out is quite different than normal. sturdy durable watch good for working out, and everyday wear."
5,Fascinating and well-researched,"Interestingly written, fascinating research... analyzes various understandings of miraculous from the parapsychological to the psychoneuroimmunological to the theological. Really enlightening. A fresh look and a must-read for anyone interested in the religious understanding of miracles."
3,Interesting perspective ... if you buy the central premise,"This book considers curious religious phenomena as manifestations of the paranormal. The author defines the terms used by parapsychologists -- telepathy, PK, precognition, etc -- and demonstrates how these ""psi"" abilities might be used to explain religious visions, faith healings and other inexplicable happenings. She also argues that a parapsychological interpretation does not invalidate the spiritual value of such phenomena.This is all well and good, if you accept the central premise of the book: namely, that paranormal abilities actually exist. This is still very much a question of faith, despite the author's calm assurance and scientific demeanor.If you are already convinced that psi effects are real, this book will provide food for thought. If you don't ..."
3,The Gift of Prophecy,I have read many books on prohecy as its a subject that creates much interest in one. Jack Deere provides a guide that will explain various things for you. If its a subject your interested in it will provide basic information that may benefit you in learing more in this area.
4,Delighted,Very impressed with 3-day delivery. Portability of machine (13 lbs) and simplicity of design functions are exactly what I wanted for a backup machine. Paper piecing is easy and accurate. I did have a problem trying to place the bobbins on the wind-up spool. Really had to force them into place. My husband thought the noise when I stitched a little distracting so I solved this by placing it on a typewriter mat.
1,Poorly Designed.,"This machine is horribly designed. In a prior review the customer stated that the machine runs but the needle stays put. The reason for this is a tiny little screw inside the plastic of the handwheel. The screw is responsible for engaging the clutch, but is encased in plastic. The torque cracks the plastic and eventually causes it to stop working. Bad design, I don't suggest purchasing."
1,Does Not Work,"I was excited when I received the machine, but it just does'nt work!!! The motor runs, but the needle does'nt move up and down. I'm very disappointed that I have to return it."
4,"Cool ""shake your rump"" vibe","Saw this band live, they were great. Solid musicianship with their own sound.Every songs sounds similar. They have a twangy, 60's mod-funk thing going. Very danceable, very groovin! They won't be the next Dylan but they make excellent party music."
2,Mix of Telecom basics and old Satellite TV Technology,"This book is a mixture of Electronics/Telecom basics and no updated Satellite TV Technology. Around 1/3 of the book shows basics concepts ( Resonance , Heterodyning , Demodulation , Full-Wave Rectifiers , Zener Diode Regulators , etc. ). Chapters 3 , 4 and 5 ( around 90 pages ) describe the old Big-Dish Systems , used to receive C-band signals .Chapter 8 , dedicated to DBS systems , is very superficial ( just 25 pages ). The same occurs with chapter 10 , that presents Encryption/Decryption Technologies : 29 pages with no updated information. Finally , the Index found in the end of the book is very confused ; for example ,DBS Satellite Transponder refers the reader to page 214 , where will be found the schematic diagram for an IRD channel display circuit ."
4,Like the picket fence shown on the cover . . .,". . This book offers brief slices of life, with glimpses between them into the larger ""back yards"" of everyday experience.For any screenwriter looking for character insights, background color, or just the you-can't-make-it-up quirkiness of real life, this book is worth devouring. Great short reads make this book rewarding to pick up and put down.I'd give it five stars, but for two reasons:1) Every story begins on a new page, often leaving TONS of white space after it ends, often at the top of a page. Closing up would have meant a shorter, handier book and saved oodles of trees.2) Auster states that these stories offer ""some elegant and sophisticated writing ... also much that is crude and awkward."" But he has quietly pared away the crude and the awkward, adding canny turns of phrase and making single words dynamic in a way that only a practiced wordsmith can do."
5,Inspiring and Instructive,"Anyone with an interest in how nonviolent resistance works should watch this film. In my college courses on political violence, I use this film to illustrate that nonviolent resistance is a viable alternative to violent insurgency, even under very repressive conditions. The film offers a mixture of activist interviews, observer commentary, and even discussion by theorists of nonviolent resistance, in explaining how this ""student movement"" helped to organize the overthrow of a dictator who couldn't be dislodged before--by domestic opponents, neighboring states, or NATO. A fantastic, inspiring, pedagogical tool for students and activists."
5,Teach peace with BDAD,"I just showed this film today to a class I teach at Portland State University, Ecology of War and Peace. During the first few weeks of class, we focus on the problems of the war system and now, today, I kicked off the elements of building a peace system with this film, which both produces and takes advantage of teachable moments. Every single student--even those who had been previously apparently catatonic--were enthused and insightful. I had to end class or they would have stayed late! It is, after all, a true story of ""powerless"" college students leading a nation to freedom. It doesn't get more relevant than that."
2,Jumpin Time jumps back to Lawrence Welk,"I had listened to several cuts from Jumpin Time on KPIG radio, and liked what I heard. After playing the full CDs, I was disappointed that fully half the cuts on the CD remind me more of Lawrence Welk than of retro Texas Swing. Live and learn. Clearly KPIG had cherry-picked the good cuts."
5,A delight,The Time Jumpers are a wonderful group. I first saw them on the Larry's Diner program on RFD. As one who loves Western Swing music you gotta love these people.
5,Western Swings,Love western swing and this is it. It also sounds somewhat like Django Reinhart. This is updated and hot. Don't doubt buying this album. It is fun and great listening.
4,Outstanding!,"An absolute delight! If you're even remotely a fan of ""Texas Swing"" you'll really enjoy this double-CD set! I'm usually NOT a fan of live recordings, but the content in this album is so good - and the recording itself so smooth and slick - that I had no trouble setting my qualms aside and really enjoying the tunes.A couple of selections weren't exactly my ""cup of tea,"" but 90% of the songs are dynamite, including the highlight, ""Sweet Memories.""The musicians are highly-skilled and super-slick, and the vocals are first-rate. Well worth a listen, or two, or ten!"
5,One of the best books in the world.,"This book is great, but the seller is something else.They never responded to my emails, and shipping was unbelievably slow."
3,flashy,"TIMES SQUARE AT NIGHT. could be nice for a game room. inexpensive. i taped mine to a heavy piece of cardboard from a delivery, pinned it to the wall with a few pushpins. looks fine. expensive frame not needed."
4,Great Picture!,The picture is a little pixelated but its still good and very cool. The paper is a little thin so just be careful with it so it doesn't tear or wrinkle.
5,New York City- Times Square Poster,"Just what I was looking for. My sister loves posters of cities so I thought she would like this one to add to her collection, I was right, she loved it! And it shipped rather quickly."
2,"great concept, poor construction","The idea is excellent. Just what I needed. Too bad it is made so poorly and the manual is worthless. Changing the blade was nothing I could accomplish myself. The thing just about fell apart and is useless. I used it and loved it, until the first blade change, and it never worked again."
3,"Blade Changing - ""That guy saved you""","My wife bought this tool on clearance, w/o packaging or instructions for $14. We couldn't install blades. Thanks to the guy who offered the ""Plier Trick"". To quote my wife, ""That guy saved you"".To expand on his instructions: If you can push the black button that moves the locking pin in and out, you need to do the trick. Get needle nose pliers or a flat head screwdriver. Push the black button, which extends the locking pin. Insert a screwdriver or pliers through the hole on the opposite side and turn the end of that pin 90 degrees. At this point, it should not retract completely when you release the button. Now, place the blade over the pin and rotate 90 degrees into place. The pin should retract. To remove the blade, push the black button, rotate the blade out of operating position (90 degrees) and slide it off the pin. It is now in position to install the next blade.Hope this is useful!"
4,YAWN...boorrr-ing....sorta....,okay this is getting old REAL fast. Im getting so SICK of this liz-conner-tia circle. Conner drinks gimme a break! CAn they really make this kids life anymore un realistic? You could skip over this book and not miss a thing. Okay wiat no you cant. Thats more of number 18. Sorry!
4,Could Have Been Better,"This book didn't get good until near the end. The storylines kind of moved slow. Conner is acting like a loser, as if that's anything new. I think that him and Elizabeth don't really make a good couple, but that's just my opinion. Although I can't wait to find out what will happen to him in the next book, although the author kind of makes it obvious. The Jessica/Jade/Jeremy storyline is kind of old, and at the same time it was kind of exciting. I don't like Jade at all. This book mostly focused on Tia and Conner, and there problems. The Will and Melissa storyline didn't really make sense in a way. First Will is only dating, Melissa because he feels like it's his duty or whatever, and then breaks up with her to date Jessica, and then all of a sudden he decides that he really is in love with Melissa and goes back to her, and now they act as if Will has always loved her. The author should make that storyline more clear. I also want to see more of Lila."
3,So-so,"This book is so-so. It seems like all the problems brewing for the last two-three books are still in stasis. It wasn't one of those can't-put-it-down books. Sadly.To be honest, I'm really getting tired of how drawn-out these books are becoming. Conner's problem is not seen by Elizabeth -- and she should have been the first to see it. Tia is still messed up. And the Jeremy/Jade/Jessica triangle is still not solved. When are they going to move on with things? It also seemed a little like the characters were wollowing in their problems too much."
4,This is a great beginning,"... and I would be delighted to read volume 2, should one be written, that might update and revisit some of the issues examined here.Despite being dated, this collection is extremely important in that it showcases in ways unavailable in other works the early attempts to identify and see connections between different issues relating to women's control over their bodies.Unfortunately in terms of my own major area of interest, the issue of prostitution is the most disappointing -- it seems to have been less thoroughly researched and certainly is less thoroughly presented than the other issues -- but the linkages are fascinating and give an organic continuity to a study of the hot button issues that continue to confront women.It's a terrific beginning, and a good place for men and women who are interested in making these connections to start reading.--- Jeannette Angell, author of ""Callgirl"""
5,Making Cocoa for Kingsley Amis,"The fantastic Wendy Cope, with her glib wit and casual satire, has written a beautiful book -- funny, tender, and sarcastic, she turns the literary status quo (two hundred-odd years of pontificating males) on its head and leaves it hanging. She's just far too clever for the boys and we love it. Just buy it. Laugh out loud."
3,expected better,"we don't get to see as much of wendy cope in the u.s. as i had hoped, so i ordered a couple of her books from amazon uk. the few poems i had come across of wendy cope's have been great poems. her touch of humor is excellent in those poems. but the poems in this collection are less than stellar. much of the time the rhymes are predictable and uninteresting. her repetition of styles and themes gets old (god knows she must love the villanelle). in this collection her nursery rhyme imitations are phenomena. i can just see wordsworth and eliot writing those. her strength seems to be in mimicry, which she didn't do much of here. i don't know, maybe the poems i like so much came from serious concerns. if you want to read someone who is a better formal poet, and has what is probably the greatest wit of any living poet, check out R.S. Gwynn's selected poems: No Word of Farewell. it's well worth it."
4,Touchdown for Heckmann!,"Ken Heckmann's gritty documentary is Friday Night Lights without the Hollywood burnish -- the true story of small-town Texas highschool football, unrehearsed, unscripted, unglamorized. The real thing, told with unflinching honesty and spiraling suspense by director Heckmann, whose fearless camera takes us right to the core of this American phenomenon."
4,"Power, Passion & Glory","This video was ok in my book. I have watched several football documentaries and this one was middle of the road. It wasn't as solid as it could have been. I enjoyed it, but there wasn't that one thing that made this team special or stick out from the rest. The coverage of the games, interviews with players + coaches, and the whole Texas high school football environment was nice, but the video kind of drug on and left me wanting to skip to the end to simply see if this particular team would end up winning it all."
4,"Best ""real Buddy"" on record","BTW, the recording closest to the ""real Buddy"" I think is the track he contributed to the soundtrack to the movie ""Rush"". (Clapton produced the rest of the soundtrack.)It's often overlooked, but superb."
3,Not the best Buddy Guy out there...,"This CD has a great band, great production and a star studded cast, that's all the things that probably make it sell, but make me not enjoy it. Buddy is great and his solos are great, but I like him best when I can close my eyes and I'm transported to a little smokey club somewhere and I'm just listening to that raw guitar, way out in front, just peelin' the paint off the walls. I guess this is an attempt to make some dough and sell some records to the pseudo blues fans, but I'd go for Stone Crazy, Blues Singer, and Sweet Tea, those all rock in their own rights."
2,Another guest artist CD that falls flat,Other than John Lee Hooker's efforts that combine superstar guest artists; there are very few CDs that successfully make this combination work. And Buddy Guy's effort isn't one of them. The duets or combination songs just simply fall flat and are strangely uninspiring. Give this one a miss and save your money.
5,Poland loves Buddy,"This is it. Another album this year. Quick listening and what. No just slow down. This is quality music and you feel Buddy, he is tru, Nothing but the blues man. All songs are pure blues and he is unprecedented King. I have all cds with him and this one will be on my top shelve. Do the do do man."
3,"Not my cup o' sweat tea, but this guy is still the baddest MF on earth!","I'm not into the whole combining artists here and there to try to win a grammy, but Buddy still makes this cool. I love all his 60's stuff as well as almost every album he's ever done. Sweet Tea is him sounding his best ( a must have in anyone's record collection). If you've never had the chance to see Buddy live GO NOW! It's worth whatever you have to pay. You'll see why Hendrix worshipped the guy."
2,NOT THAT GREAT,"I know it's Buddy that is not enough to make it great. I bought this after reading the reviews and was kind of disappointed. It's not bad, just a lot of weak songs, very toned down and very few good guitar solos, just very slow and not the old smoking Buddy. Like always this is just my thoughts, and I am sure this one is not for everybody. Some will pick this review apart, but I am a huge Buddy Guy fan. I have over 30 cd's by him. I just find this one to be weak after listening to his others. Do yourself a favor listen before you buy."
2,Setting the record straight,"First of all,I don't know you people pull your facts from.Probably the same place Buddy pulled the material for this album from.#1 Jimi Hendrix did not""follow around Buddy Guy with a Tape Recorder"".Were you there??#2 Buddy Guy is probably THE BEST LIVE guitarist still breathing.This I know because I've seen him more times than any of you!#3 In making my last statement Buddy has not been a good studio player in the last 2 decades.Just because he's a ""LEGEND"" and I say that because (I know all you ""know it alls""know thats the name of his bar,which by the way I've also been too,)that doesn't mean everything he puts out is Gods gift to the world!!My advice for the people reading this is being your not real fans of Buddy Guy anyway,Because if you were you wouldn't read this review before you got the album,Is go see him live,buy all his live albums Get every album before 1985 and stop making up facts about the Best LIVING BLUES GUITARIST!!Have a nice day!"
5,Very happy after two weeks of listening,"Bring Em In is one of the few albums worth buying today . It has a good set of songs for different people, all very well performed. Buddy Guy is a great singer, and can sing in a variety of styles. He's like six superstar guitarists rolled into one. Very talented. I'm still enjoying the album after listening to it for two weeks."
5,The Guy is Great,"Another great Buddy Guy album. Good solos, his guitar tone is all there. some different styles. a must have for Buddy guy fans."
2,There are WAY better games,"If you are looking for good first person shooters, here is a list of some you should try: Half-Life, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Medal of Honor: Allied Assualt, Aliens vs. Predator 2, and Red Faction. The best thing about this game is the very large outdoor enviroment. Try any of these and you will decide that the Delta Force series [isn't as good]."
3,arrogant attitude,"I have all the Delta Force games and was looking forward to owning Amber Falls. After buying Delta Force Extreme from Fryes in Mesquite, Tex and trying to install into my Pentium 3, it would not load. I read the requirements which I did not have, so I called your company (Novalogic)and was told i needed to at least upgrade my vidieo card. Ok, I did, but it still would not play. In the mean-time I moved to Las Vegas and bought a new computer. I tried to load the newest game and it would not load, fro some reason I forget. I called Novalogic again and was told the game I had was a used game I apparently had bought off of the street. I explained and was told to take it back where I had bought it. If you cannot resolve this problem, I will continue to boycott you products and write more reviews about my sad story.ALSO; Tell me about Amber FallsLarry King"
2,I felt let down...,"I can't believe that anybody would say that this game has improved graphics over DFLW. They use the same engine, only this one seems to run slower. And the enemy AI is pathetic. You can almost walk up to some of them before they bother to notice you are there to take their lives. I have been down with the last 3 Delta Force games, but the only thing i can figure is that this last effort(or lack of effort) by Novalogic must be a way to make money before the greatest game, DF Black Hawk Down, gets here. The reason I gave this game 2 stars is because Novalogic had a good idea with letting you choose from 10 different special forces soldiers, and because i love the supressed M4. If you really feel compelled to get this game, then go ahead. But if you can hold out until Black Hawk Down gets here, then wait for it."
3,Task Force Dagger,"I have most of the Nova Logic, Delta Force, games and with the possable exection of the very first one, this one is the worst. There are many graphic glitches that permit you to walk straight through an object. The graphics themselves are no as well rendered as the preveous games. Also, the buildings and many other aspects of the game layout look to be only slightly altered from ""Land Warrior"" (which is, in my oppinion, the best game they have made). Hopefully they will make a patch or other upate to improve this game."
1,Hmm..,"First of all my keycode was already in use by 5 other Nova accounts. So I contacted support. It's non-existant. I got an email back which looked like it was ""automated"". It didn't give me any info about my problem exept tell me about copied keycodes. I also have alot of problems with the game crashing when I try to play multiplayer. And again, tech support was no help. The only reason I bought this game was because I liked Land Warrior. I wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their money on this game."
5,The best Delta Force game yet,I have this game and i play it every day. I have every delta force game that has came out and this one's the best. the graphics are a little better. The multiplayer games are alot better. it is just alot better.
1,"incredibly stupid enemies, poor graphics","Worst enemy AI I've seen in several years. They just... sit there.No flanking manouvers, no counterattacks, no nothing. They justsit there. You can kill someone, and the guy right next to himwon't notice.On top of that, the graphics are about three years out of date,and the level design consists of dozens of identical, empty buildings.Skip this one."
3,Not as good as DF2,"I haven't yet played Task Force Dagger, but it looks like a marked improvement over Delta Force: Land Warrior, which was a disappointment after Novalogic's phenomenal Delta Force 2. I liked DF2's gritty, pixelated look, much more than the smooth but cartoony engine of DF:LW. Also, DF2 offered thick tree lines and tall grasses for concealment, but DF:LW's terrain was borning and monochromatic. Most importantly, the DF:LW interface, with its multiple keyboard commands plus mouse movements, was much too complicated when compared with the beautiful simplicity of DF2. I hope Task Force Dagger has improved upon all these flaws, and I look foward to playing it."
5,Excellent source for improving a relationship,"We found this book to be excellent---taking the time to occasionally share your ideas with your partner as you read thru the questions encourages your partner to share other ideas with you. It's a great way to learn about the other one's feelings. In the long run, these questions help you to compare your values as a couple and therefore strengthen any relationship.Also makes a great gift for your friends, and especially for people just getting together to form a new relationship or partnership.Highly recommended also for counselors and therapists."
5,Thoroughly enjoyable,"Rocío Durcal puts her soul into Mexican music. She gives personality to each and every song, and her rendition of Amor Eterno is second to none. Her Spanish pronunciation of the z's or c's doesn't take anything away from the Mexicanity of the music."
3,"Good Collection, but missing a FEW career high hits.","Overall, it's a pretty good collection of Rocio's work and most of her famous and loved hits. However, I can't believe classics like ""Costumbres"", ""Frente a Frente"", ""Sombras...Nada Mas!"" are not included. I feel like it's done on purpose to force her fans to purchase these tracks seperately. This CD is good overall. Not perfect, as it falls short as an ultimate collection of Rocio's greatest work."
3,"Great product, but don't buy it if you own a nano","The iFrame System is incredable, but it's only compadable with devices that have the headphone jack on the top. So, if you have a device that has a headphone slot on the bottom (Like the nano), don't buy this product"
4,A Handy Little Machine,"Even though it is really for the homeowner, we have used this washer in a commercial application, for a total of about 250 hours over a six month period. It was reliable and worked well. Plenty of power for anything you would do around the house. Recently the pressure has begun to drop off, so I'm thinking the pump is wearing out. If that is it's useful life, that would be fine for the average homeowner using it occasionally. We used it to wash down about 10,000 square feet of concrete every morning. Now I'm buying a bigger unit."
1,DONT BUY HERE,"I RECENTLY ORDERED THIS ITEM, I STILL DONT KNOW HOW GOOD IT IS, THE REST OF THE REVIEWS SAY IT IS A GOOD PRESSURE WASHER, SO I ASSUME IT IS. BUT THE REVIEW I HAVE IS (DON'T ORDER IT FROM AMAZON), I HAVE HAD THIS ITEM FOR SEVEN DAYS SO FAR, AND HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH AMAZON ABOUT MISSING PARTS, AND STILL DON'T KNOW ANYMORE THAN I DID WHEN I OPENED THE BOX AND SEEN THEY WHERE MISSING.I CAN'T GIVE YOU A RATING ON THE PRESSURE WASHER ITS SELF BECAUSE I'M NOT ABLE TO USE IT, BUT THE RATING I WILL GIVE ON THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE FROM 1 TO 5 IS A FLAT OUT 0"
1,Marlboros in a can,"Wow. Apparently in England ""sandalwood"" means ""cigarettes."" I cracked open the tub and took a whiff, and couldn't even use it. The smell? A 1942 Marine who has been in the South Pacific mixed with a pack of unfiltered Lucky Strikes and a hint of orange zest. Not a good combo. Sorry, but this one I can't recommend."
4,good stuff,"I have tried a lot of shave creams and soaps, and this is right up there with the best-- but not my absolute favorite, hence the 4 instead of 5. It is really more like a 4 1/2 though, so I would not hesitate to recommend it. (I prefer the much cheaper prorasa, as well as the more expensive Nancy Boy and Etro, but the difference is not great)."
3,Only 60% shot in high definition,"Great movie, but if you are buying the blu ray, be aware that 40% of the movie is shot in standard definition, very disappointed as this is the only reason i bought it was for high definition action.still the action is great."
3,Part time High Definition,"Great movie, but if you are buying the blu ray, be aware that 40% of the movie is shot in standard definition, very disappointed as this is the only reason i bought it was for high definition action.still the action is great."
1,"Too much talk, too little skiing","This is the worst skiing video I have ever purchased. There was almost no skiing for 30 minutes. Too much talk, too liitle skiing, poor video work. Any decent music was interupted by talk. This video sucked!"
1,"not 1.6 pounds, only 8 ounces.",description is incorrect. box is only 8 ounces. 4 little lunchbox size bags in the tin. not worth $14.
4,"Meditative, Peaceful, Spiritual","I recommend Waves to anyone who has trouble sleeping. It really helps you relax and to sit quietly for a few minutes... It's great to have Waves bring the soothing beach to me in my small apartment, late at night."
5,Great for Meditation!,What a wonderful way to clear your mind sitting quietly on a beach. The sounds of the surf alone will help calm you. The sights of incredible sunsets make you realize how beautiful and precious life is. Highly recommended for anyone who meditates or is in search of a quiet place of solitude!
3,"Relaxing and pleasant, but colors seem off","I love these ocean videos, since I'm 1500 miles from the sea and can't get there as often as I'd like. This one has some lovely scenes, but the colors bother me. They feel strange and artificial, muddy purply-brown skies, gray seas, weird florescent flowers...These look like places I'd love to visit, but it's hard to believe I'm there with those strange colors. I don't know if they used filters, or if the light really did happen to look like that. Maybe they went looking for odd light conditions. I'd find it a lot more relaxing with some blue sunny skies and orange sunsets."
2,Pigface's Martin Atkins Does Christmas,"An Industrial Christmas Carol features Martin Atkins and the Chicago Industrial League performing two songs, ""The Spirit of Christmas"" and ""I'm Dreaming of a White Noise Christmas,"" along with an ""Introduction"" and an ""Outro."" This isn't your traditional Christmas music, for sure; rather, this is extreme industrial music crossed with a holiday theme. Interesting at the least, Industrial Christmas Carol should delight those who appreciate industrial music or those already familiar with Atkins and the Chicago Industrial League's music."
3,Not the sharpest,"I ordered a Tweezerman product from Amazon and it was time to replace the blades. They get the job done, but the blade that came with the product was a lot sharper."
2,not that good,it is not working well that i expected.it did not shave callus well enough.should be more sharp. thanks
1,DON'T PURCHASE THIS!,"I HAVE BEEN A LONG FAN OF TWEEZERMANS' PRODUCTS UNTIL NOW. I FOUND THESE BLADES TO BE SO DULL THAT AT WHATEVER PRICE YOU'LL BE PAYING TOO MUCH. BEING THAT I KNOW THIS PRODUCT, I HOLD THE MANUFACTURER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUB QUALITY OF THE BLADES. SUB SEQUENTIALLY, CAUSING ONE TO MAYBE ORDER MORE OFTEN, MAYBE? WELL, I'M NOT DOING IT, I'M SWITCHING PRODUCTS. SAVE YOUR MONEY I WISHED I HAD DONE SO!"
1,Bad quality,"Razors are breaking at once. I tried them on soft skin, dry skin. Result is the same. I spent entire kit on 2 sessions"
5,works great,im glad i found this online. this workd great with my tweezer man. i happy that all the blades we wraped. i will order ths again without a doubt.
3,Like all of the Dummie books,"Adobe sadly didn't include much of a tutorial with the software, so I opted for a Dummie book- really a small investment. It's actually well written and easily understandable, though the first four chapters are a bit too simplistic for someone who has any familiarity with any graphic design apps or other Adobe products. It's by no means a tutorial; there are no excercises nor is there a disk. The style is wordy, familiar, and as such it makes information accessible to non-techies. This will hold me until ""Real World InDesign"" comes out in June."
4,GREAT SINGLE FROM A MAJESTIC ALBUM,"From their Great Annihilator album, Celebrity Lifestyle is atypical of their style, an ironic indictment of Hollywood Babylon with Gira's awesome world-weary voice, Jarboe's disembodied backing vocals and Bill Rieflin's hypnotic drumming. Mother/Father, sung by Jarboe, is gut wrenching raw emotion ending in an apocalyptic bellow -- a potent piece of latterday Punk. You Know Everything (available on the Various Failures album), is an eerie sound collage reminiscent of ""Identity"" from Love Of Life. Do investigate the album though, as it contains more great songs like Mind/Body/Light/Sound, My Buried Child, Warm, Blood Promise and the earth-shaking title track."
2,what happened?,"note: i write this as an avid wilco/jeff tweedy fan. as said fan, i feel an obligation to share critical feedback. i was really excited to throw the disc in when i bought it. however, i almost immediately felt something missing. i figured i just needed to give it a few listens. but still, i wasn't ""feelin' it"". then by chance my wife was playing an earlier recording of a show in denmark. same tour. and i realized how much more energy, rawness and life existed in that show than in the chicago show captured on this official release. the chicago show just sounds way too safe, way too ""perfect""? what happened? were these shows at the vic just too contrived? too prepared? too self consciously performed? very underwhelming experience for me. find a bootleg."
3,"It's good, but..","I agree with the reviewer who said that this CD is an accurate portrait of where the band is today, live. I saw them three times on the last tour, and have been a fan of the band since AM came out ten years ago.However, I just don't know what the point of this latest CD is. Most of the songs aren't all that different from the studio versions (Compare that to, say, Radiohead's I Might Be Wrong). Moreover, Wilco is a far better studio band than live act these days. They don't pack the firepower of a great live show -- their best music's subtle, dependent on textures and contrast and nuance, and that's hard to get across in a live setting.So what's the point? Is this nothing more than product, calculated to boost the band's sales revenues? Make a few bucks off the fan base? The CD is not bad, but it seems such a conservative move, marking time with a band that until recently was right on the cutting edge of creativity. In that sense, then, it's a disappointment."
4,"""Let's get the party started... with some mid-tempo rock...""","I'm a Wilco fan -- hey I'm a young white male intellectual music geek who drinks a lot of beer and is fond of wearing boots and hep T-shirts and Carhartt attire, so I kind of have to.When I first heard about this live take, and saw the set lists, I actually didn't see much point to the record because so much of the material comes from the past two albums which are, to put it mildly, a bit studio oriented.But the bottom line is: I got it, listened to it a few times, and I'm hooked. Sweet melodies with abrasive edges. The tunes are similar-yet-different enough from the originals so that it doesn't feel at all like a burn, and it's about two hours of solid, hooky, sludgy pop. And it includes a cover of ""Comment"" by Charles Wright and the Watt 103rd St. Rhythm Band. And I enjoy listening to Tweedy show his ass to some of the idiots in the crowd."
4,Neo classic band at its peak,"Over the last few years, Tweedy and the band have seamlessly absorbed Neil Young, the Stones (who they opened for last fall), the Beach Boys, the Beatles, not to mention some 70s prog rock a la Genesis into their own signature sound. In the process, they've found their own identity. They're instantly recognizable, and, while still not known to most classic rock aficionados, are steadily veering toward the mainstream.Having seen them live 2 or 3 times in the last couple of years, this is, as Rolling Stone put it, ""a love letter to their fans"".The recording quality is excellent, and the setlist consists mostly of material from the two most recent albums with a few older gems (""one by one"" is outstanding) thrown in for good measure.I'd go so far as to say this is a great starting point even if you don't have any Wilco albums, and definitely a must have for long time fans."
2,What am I missing?,"I really can't remember why I picked up this CD. Maybe I read all the great reviews here. Maybe I'm just always searching out GOOD music that I haven't heard before. I do know that in my quest for great CD's (some of which are obscure, some of which are well known), occasionally I pick one up one in which I think to myself, ""huh, what was I thinking?"". Don't get me wrong, I tried to like this CD. I've listened to it several times, and while its OK in places it just doesn't do anything for me. The sound of the vocals tend to be annoying to me. Hmmm, well, to each his own. I guess those that find this CD ""amazing"", and it seems there are many, are listening to something different than I am."
1,Just a Warning,"This item is for the 1st gen shuffle, the long one, not the 2nd gen shuffle that looks like a clip. It doesn't say which gen it is for on the page and the 'buy it together' (which pictures the 2nd gen shuffle) can be misleading!"
4,A very unusual combination,"For one who knows Amalia Rodrigues' Fados, this record is quite a surprise. I definitely prefer her voice on the fados, but it was very interesting to hear her in a register of american songs. I would recommend the record to anyone interested to know every aspects of her talents, but not to someone who likes to listen to ""classic"" american songs."
4,Steelers Fleece,"My son received this jacket for Christmas ans hasn't taken it off. He loves it. I haven't washed it yet but it looks like it will hold up well. He likes it because it's not too heavy and it is his team. The zipper is a good heavy duty metal one and the seams are all strong and well made. He'll get a lot of wear from this jacket, I just hope I can sneak it in the wash soon."
3,The other albums are better.,"Although I'll give some credit for the appealing epic ambience of the album, and the light touches of dub, and the snazzy cover art, this isn't one of the best DVOA releases I've heard. If you find the usual material too abrasive or difficult to listen to, you might enjoy this more, but generally speaking I found albums like Shap and Hafted Maul more inventive and interesting."
4,"Slips around a bit, but great","It definitely does what it is supposed to, but the cover is rather slippery. Still, great to not have aching hips every morning any more."
1,Completely unuseable for me,"I purchased this exact knee pillow elsewhere and had high hopes of it helping. It does not stay in place well, despite the strap, and it is hard as a rock. The ""scoop"" also did not fit my larger leg and it is way too thick, considering that it is not cushy at all. I pawned it off on my hubby who has smaller legs and knees thinking he would like it. He couldn't use it either. Just too hard. I would recommend looking for one that is made of poly fill or memory foam, as this high density foam version has ""sharp"" edges and is painful.As a side note, I moved it down to just above my ankle and was able to use it there without pain. However, the strap does not adjust that small so it wouldn't stay in place."
1,Knee Ease Pillow....A BUST!!!!!,"This product DOES NOT WORK! Pillow slips and slides and will not remain in place. It is not as advertised! VERY DISAPPOINTED with this product. Will NOT recommend to my worst enemy!! If there were a rating of 0, that would be my rating! A serious waste of money!!!,"
4,Good starter introduction to Autocad,"The book is very easy to follow using an example based approach. The book should not be tackled without a copy of autocad14. It is basically an introduction in depth in certain areas.For getting started on using autocad and to start creating drawings even in 3D it is excellent. The main criticism for me was that the book is only for beginners and does not go into enough detail on data exchange ie OLE ,DXF etc . I feel an overview of all the facilities working in the (dare I say it) microsoft enviroment with some more examples would have brought the book up to 5 stars."
1,Casio AD-1,Although advertised as AD-1 I actually received AD-1UL. The plug would not fit my Casio keyboard. I spliced in a different plug and it now works.
5,Nice product,This adapter has been working flawlessly with our small Casio keyboard. Certainly serving well after a couple of years. Must have saved me a lot of battery money.
3,"snug fit, just buy some batteries...","The pin for the keyboard didn't really fit so I just bought some batteries..... used once but you had to push so hard to get it on the keyboard, others are probably better but, maybe they sent me a mislabeled one or something. 2.5 stars because it seems to work good for the stereo i use it for after I cut the end off...."
2,Misleading advertisement,"Amazon's advertising for the Casio AD-1 Power Supply is a little confusing because the transformer appears with its correct model number AD-1 along with text that indicates it's for the Casio SA-75 keyboard. However, above that line of text it also appears as image next to a picture of the Casio SA-76, with a plus sign between them suggesting that they go together. Unfortunately, the jack end of the Casio AD-1 power supply doesn't fit into the DC 9.5 volt port on the back of the SA-76 keyboard, so I couldn't use it.I contacted the seller and they told me the correct transformer for the Casio SA-76 electronic keyboard won't be available from Casio until December."
5,Right Hard to Ffind Adapter,"Can't find this at retail stores, even though they sell the keyboards. Shipped right away."
4,Good watch,"This is a very nice watch, looks very good and sportive, it has chronometer, countdown timer, second timer, and ez illuminator, as well as a good alrm and date information, only thing that happened to mine is that the wristband crack very soon and breaked, it was easy to change with any generic brand though, looks very similar to the one Arnie Swarchgenegger wears in the movie Commando."
1,Go to another choice..,"I had this watch a long time ago. As I was browsing through the G Shock seletion..I just saw it.. and I remembered owning it and now recall how flimsy it was.If you are AT ALL rough with your watches, play sports with them (and not ""IN"" them, ahhhhem)...then this watch is not going to last you. Very poor battery life right off the bat.. That one button that does not protrude is SO annoying...what are you suppose to do when you need to press it (which can be often) , grow a pinky nail?? It is a bad design flaw.Look at other wachtes if you need something rugged...this is skinny, by no means is this a large watch, as some reviewer mentioned above.. this is puny and not made for tough men.."
1,inappropriate pictures,"As a preschool teacher, I find the pictures in this book completely inappropriate and quite disturbing. The little girl in this book is pictured with only her underwear on. There are pictures of her and her mother with clothing on, which is appropriate.In this day and age, I find it appalling that a mother would allow publication of pictures of her daughter wearing only her underwear. Some of the poses would not be disturbing if she had been wearing clothing.I am surprised that nobody else feels this way. What is stopping a sexual predator from checking this book out of the library? I would never be comfortable with this book in my home or school and I would never recommend it."
3,Expected a lot more,"I bought this item expecting it to transform my water-stained cabinets, but it didn't do the wonders I'd hoped for. It was easy to apply, but after it dried, the cabinets didn't look that much different than before. My husband couldn't tell which cabinets I'd done and which I hadn't. I did try it a second time and got the same results. For the time and effort, it didn't seem valuable."
3,guardsman polish,"This polish does not seem superior to other furniture polishes that I've used, though it does an adequate job. I guess that I expected a higher gloss since it is touted as being preferred by professionals."
5,The BEST,"Guardsman is a premier furniture polish that rejuvenates fine furniture. We have used nothing else, over 40+ years. The seller of this polish, an Amazon partner, also did everything right. Much pleased."
5,k&n 57-1546,This intake was shipped fast and has added more HP and MPG in my 08 dakota. It was very easy to install and I would order another one if I ever get another truck. It was a great price too.
3,Little Triggers,"This all-midget musical western starts off with a bang and then, like most of these types of turkeys, gets mired down in almost the same way a serious drama can be mired. Except this vehicles' hubs are set a little lower so the misery is somewhat tougher to spin out of. In fact, it's impossible to get out of.On the other hand, the musical performances are bright, chirpy and likely to hurt your ears if you are sensitive to high pitched squeaky noises.In short, I recommend this little entertainment. It is especially enjoyable if you doze off right after the opening titles and wake up just in time to go to bed for the night."
3,Kinda Korney,"I bought it, i'm not sorry I did, but it's not all that great, if you like odd ball comdeyyou will like this, not a good western tho ...... silly stuff"
2,Terror of Tiny Town,"Video Froze up about the 2nd part while all were singing in the bar, I had to restart it and skip to next segment."
5,"Fly, the Poet","In Janet Amundsen's poetry the reader is taken on a journey of her personal feelings, experience, and beauty, which meld with one's own emotions and life. This poet is also an amazing crafter of words. For instance, her poem, ""Right To Left Or Left To Right"" can be read in either direction and is profound in message either way and beautiful in sound and structure in both directions. I read ""Moment (From A Postcard Titled: Horses)"" aloud to an audience of mixed ages and interests. There was a perceptible sigh of awe when I finished. Her words aim to the heart and her genius of wordsmithing aims to the mind, the combination of which makes great poetry. I would recommend this book for yourself in which to indulge and as gifts for others. I have given two as presents and want to order more for others to experience what I think is perfection in poetry."
5,Simply PERFECT!!!,"Clever; from the first lyric to the very last. Not to mention catchy; from the first sound to the very last. This is truly a rare masterpiece. It resonates the same qualities as the greatest works of the musical artform in the history of mankind. One thing that makes it so great is its underlining unity. The unified concept. A progressive, evolutionary message, hidden, ever do subtlely, in the metaphoric web of humour and wit. What is the perfect Hip Hop album? What is a timeless Hip Hop album? Lift off, move your body, and find out by purchasing this (no adjective could do it justice) album. Spot the G and stimulate yourself..."
5,As a fellow Nature Photographer Larry's Book was great help in developing my Photographic Eye,"In April 20010, I went to Sedona to experience this beautiful area and capture the wonders contained within it.I enrolled in a photo workshop with Larry Lindahl and haven't regretted the time,money for the knowledge I've gained. It has changed my life and how I approach my photography."
4,very good could not put down kept you very interested,i have read alot of her books and they including this one are very goo
1,Just one depravity after another!,"Tried to read this follow-up book to see what happens to Skye, but the cruelty and depravity is the real story. So if you're keen on that, or at the very least don't find it disturbing, this book is for you!"
2,Great Book,Betrice Small must be the Queen of Erotic writing. Her words flow through the story easily. An the stories are well researched in historical facts. I would recommend this book for the adventure minded.
1,Caution !,"I was very excited after reading this book. It all made perfect sense to me. I immediately ordered both Co Q 10 and Carnitine. I took them as instructed in the book. After about 3 or 4 days I began retaining water at an alarming rate. I was thirsty constantly. I continued taking the Energy Pack for a couple more days, thinking that my body needed to adjust to the supplements. I continued to retain water. I stopped taking the Energy Pack and within 2 days I stopped retaining water and my thirst stopped. The author claims there are no side effects, I think she needs to review that claim. If it works for you fine but watch out for side effects."
1,Thought It Was New,"Thought I was buying a new one of these and it turned out to be used and it was quite expensive, so I'm bit upset, but my wife will read it as it is."
3,quack book?,"I'm frequently weary of books with little medical backing and that open as follows: ""neither the publisher nor the author is engaged in rendering professional advice ... and neither the author nor the publisher shall be responsible for any loss, injury, or damage"" arising from infomation in this book."
2,Totally Bummed,"I requested this thumb-drive for Christmas and have been using it for only 2 months. I had used it several times over the course of those two months. I loaded my lecture presention on to the drive, and when I got to the room I was presenting in, it didn't work. Thankfully I am very anal and had 2 or 3 back-up options, so it didn't ruin my presentation.I have tried it on 6 computers now and it still does not work (the computers do not recognize it). I am very disappointed. What a waste of a Christmas present and any data that I saved on it."
1,Not good . No sirve,Not good I Have a lot of problems. after two weeks I used I can't to see in mi computer. I think throw away.
1,Didn't work at all,"I bought this because of the price, I thought it was a bargain, but it turn out to be a loss, it just did not work, I always received the message ""disk I/O error"", wich means that it had a hardware failure, so I'm going to return it and buy Lexar instead."
1,Virus pre-installed,"My Sandisk 256 Cruzer Micro came with a program, encrypt.exe, pre-installed on it. When I try to run it my AV detected a virus, W95/CIH.A.Yikes!!"
3,"good performance, durability issues","In 1.5 years of use, I have had no problems with the functionality of the usb flash drive. Adequate speed and portability. Never bothered with key ring/lanyard because I bring it in backpack or briefcase.However, the usb connector is prone to bending and splitting. The two halves are fused together on the two narrow sides. My usb connector is split 1/64 inch on both sides and is bent. It nevertheless still works, though I am afraid this sort of wear and damage may eventually hinder functionality."
3,Model revision,"I am only giving three stars to the cruzer micro simply because i don't care for their revisions to the model. Outside of the revisions this is still a very sturdy and reliable drive. the first complaint is that there is no longer a blue LED light which was one of there ""special features"" and for me a selling point. it's back to crummy green. The second is that the body is no longer coated with a sturdy transparent plastic but now with a removable translucent one. The only advantage to the revision is now the protective cap actually stays on the unit for more than half an hour. I owned one of the original models and would gladly put up with no cap to have the original better looking drive. If you would like to see pictures of what this drive really looks like you need to go to the sandisk site."
2,Inside is fragile!,"I've had this for just over a year, and it worked great during that time, but then this week, every single file I had on it was inexplicably corrupted (and, yes, I'm sure it was NOT a virus). When I called SanDisk, the guy told me that the drive had to be reformatted and that there was no way to save the files. He also said that the reason was probably that I had removed the drive before I had stopped it (and everyone will do that at least once -- sometimes the computer won't let the drive stop). In my opinion, a flash drive shouldn't be so fragile that one removal would cause everything to be corrupted!"
1,DOESN'T WORK ON MY DELL PC or GATEWAY LAPTOP,I had to order the Sandisk Cruzer Mini instead.I tried two Micros. They both would work once and never again be recognized by my computers.
4,Absolutely wonderful,"Reads AND Writes fast. There was a comment earlier about the write speed, but mine seems to write very fast and I work with fairly large files. The cap doesn't seem to fit all too well though. But I highly recommend this drive."
4,"small, does what it says.","it's tiny, cheap, and works as expected so far. Dosn't feel too fragile and the included rubber covers seem to be designed well, just make sure you push the cover on firmly."
4,Works great,i believe i will have enough space to save everything for school on this one storage device. 4 years of college in one place is great.
4,"SANDISK micro cruzer - tiny, cool and rugged","PROS:tiny - memory and mouse stack together on laptop USB portscool - blue light when idle, so you know its thererugged - been through the wash no problemCONS:tiny - gets lost in pockets! Put this baby on your key chain.cool - blue light flashes when busy (disco anyone?)ragged - caps don't stay on (2 supplied)"
4,Works well overall,"The Cruzer Micro has worked well for me for several months. It's compact, easily portable, and works with both USB 1.1 and 2.0 ports. The read/write speed is faster than USB 1.1 flash drives, but slower than many other USB 2 flash drives (by a factor of at least two when compared to the high speed Sandisk Cruzer Titanium). One problem I've had is with the protective cap not fitting snuggly to the drive and can easily come off (happened several times already). Since the cap so small, it's easy to lose.Overall, it is a well design flash drive. With its compact size, I end up using this a lot more often than my Cruzer Titanium."
1,STOPPED WORKING AFTER 2 MONTHS!,"I really liked it until it went totally dead. I left it plugged into my pc overnight & next morning it was totally dead. Can't get it to respond on any pc. I tried 3 of them. It is totally dead... Luckily, I had it backed up.I'll keep you posted on what Sandisk does about it.It has now been 1 month since I complained to Sandisk.It took them about 2 weeks to send me an RMA & that only came after I called on the phone. I got no response from my online complaint. I sent it back within a day. And now it's been a month since I originally complained & still no replacement... Although my account says closed because it was an even exchange. When I can expect this exchange I do not know..."
1,It broke.,"Y'know how when you have something on your keyring it can get twisted around and compressed in your pocket? Well, the plastic where you attach the keyring broke. It can't be fixed.My ancient lexar jumpdrive has a metal bar in the same place. It's still useful, if ugly."
4,"Great, except the skins","I'm a section editor at a high school newspaper and I have used this drive every day both in that class and in all my others for over a year and it has never let me down. It's small, sleek and elegant and has a quick transfer rate.The only issue is with the caps ans skins, which get annoyingly loose over time. I carry it around on a little pouch on my keys that I keep on my belt loop. When I pull it out of the pouch it will sometimes pull off the cap and skin. It's a minor annoyance for an otherwise great flash drive.I just went out and bought the 1GB version and I use them both!"
4,Incontournable,"Wong really deserves to be known. Some actors and actresses has been forgotten, obscured by the BIG ones. It is great to have some people shed light on them. See her in ""Shangai Express"" where her presence is extraordinary (even besides Dietrich) and any silent movies buff shouldn't miss ""Piccadilly"".I think there was a lot of details in her life to tell and maybe the author was obliged to compress this book a bit too much (the publisher's fault?)...A good buy. Wong is ""incontournable""."
5,A Great Book,"I have just finished this book, Anna May Wong by Graham Hodges. it is terrific-- well researched, well analyzed, and well written. I recommend this one to those who are interested in Anna May Wong, the top Asian actress."
5,A Terrific Book,"This is a great book, which I highly recommend to the readers interested in cinema and Asian Studies. Thanks to Graham Hodges for writing such a complete picture and providing inspiring insights into the life of a forgotten Chinese American actress. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a rich biography filled with extraordinary research and detail. 5 Stars!"
2,"Nice enough, but inaccurate as heck","Sadly I have yet to read another biography on Anna May Wong, so I can not recommend one. But this one really should be passed over...or taken with a grain of salt.Hodges writing style is dry. Its almost as if he took several documents...then told us he did. ""Anna went to China in such and such year, she then returned on such and such date"". Page after page this gets annoying. There are also several typos and misspellings...an odd thing for a published book.My biggest complaint is Hodges perpetuated the myth that Anna May Wong was buried in an unmarked grave. Several biographers have repeated as such but in actuality Anna is buried under her chinese name (it took a website Forget the Talkies, to find this out). Seems simple enough to research; especially by someone claiming to be so in touch with Chinese history and symbolisim (he goes on and on about her hairstyles). Not worth the read, try another bio."
2,Disappointing,"Clearly the author spent a considerable amount of time researching the material but inaccuracies, extensive grammatical errors and banal prose coupled with a stringent politically correct agenda make this a tedious read."
2,Cheap... but it works,It is very cheaply made. After shooting about a dozen arrows the biscuit (round part that holds the arrow) came loose and fell off. This is held in place by two allen screws however kept getting loose. Might be able to fix this with thread lock but I just threw it away. The quick shot versions seem a bit sturdier I went that route. Not bad for the price but a crucial element that you cannot afford to fail when in the woods.
2,HIGHS and lows.....,"Evertime I think I'm getting the Goldberg-DDP/Hogan-Warrior PPV I get this one instead, Its not too bad, with DDP/Savage stealing the show and Henning/Flair in a dream match. The main event is pretty weak, Hogan and Piper in a cage Piper can work but hogan trying to climb a cage, you know what kind of risk taker he is so you can imagine how lame it is, the highlight of the match was when 9 Sting look-a-likes start circling the ring, then Savage blows by them and does an impressive jump off the top of the cage in what I thought would have broke his legs, then some fan climbs the cage and one of the Stings becomes an impromptu security guard and tackles him in the ring then Hogan and Savage start wailing on him, it was the most disorganized thing I ever saw, its made for a good ending to a match that was about to put me to sleep. They should pay this kid for saving this PPV"
2,Not worth it!,All the songs seem exactly the same. It sounds like progessive music was called progressive in the 80s. I would rather hear the singer not all at all. All I kept hearing was talking instead of singing. This music was not more fortay. I like listening to 80s and 90s rock and that surely was not it.
1,"Dated, maudlin, and tedious.","I had high hopes for this book, what with all the five-star reviews, so I was very open-minded when I began to read it. However, it soon became evident how ""late forties"" the writing style is, with so much lingo and attitude of that era filtering into the story. Then, there is the increasingly preposterous turn of events in Candy's adventures. While the author makes a game attempt at providing a dog's-eye view of the world, it becomes increasingly apparent that the behavior your are reading about is simply not how a dog would really behave, especially under these circumstances of being lost. It finally became so full of loony plot devices and goofy twists that I found myself cringing at the ridiculousness of each new turn of events. I am a sentimental person by nature, and I love dogs, but this book is not realistic enough for my taste."
5,A book you will remember for years!,"I first read this book in junior high. It is now thirty some years later and I am ordering it to read again. I am sure that my children will enjoy and remember it like I have. This is a ""must read"" for anyone who loves animals."
4,Interesting X-mas album,"if you like different christmas music albums, this is one to check out. I like it but don't love it and I am a big fan of this Band. I think it was an attempt to identify with a western audience, but I am not sure they quite made it with this one. Still listen at christmas time when I want a different sound."
1,ACDelco CR43TS Professional Conventional Spark Plug,"The AC Delco product itself is great. But the packaging from this retailer was not sufficiant enough!I ordered a set of 8 spark plugs. They came in the normal 8 plug thin cardboard box. Then that was placed in a non-padded envelope. On two of the spark plugs, the ground electrodes were bent badly, closing the gaps. I re-gapped the plugs correctly, but I have a little miss. Now I have to replace them again. The package must have been dropped and the package was not cushioned enough!I think the next time I do a tune-up, I'll just get my spark plugs from the local auto store."
4,This Book is awesome,This Book was great. Even though Jon saved the day it was cool. I like it best when Garfield (Garzooka)tried to put them back togather and messed up everything. also I wonder if there will be another cause they should because these are the best
5,SOCIOLOGY MADE READABLE,"Given this book by a friend I opened it with some apprehension.But, from the introduction to the conclusion I was hooked. A fascinating study of a particular urban species. Bearman applies academic standards, but manages to enliven it with pungent observations, one on one interviews, and very human insights. I hope he applies these same sociology and writing skills to other denizens of the city."
1,TOO DULL & TOO EXPENSIVE,"Why I relied on Amazon readers' reviews [?friends/students of the author?] to the exclusion of the Publishers Weekly criticism, I'll never know.Trying to write this review based on what the book is, as opposed to what I assumed it was, is not easy.This volume is an in depth cultural and sociological study of doormen; a treatise written with the fervor of a tract. There is no need for this subject to be dreary not to mention the inanity of the charts that are incorporated within the text. I stuck through the first 115 pages and then put it aside; far aside.Yes, University Presses are understandably higher priced than mainstream publishing, but the U. of Chicago Press should have staple bound this and distributed it to those libraries that might have a readership interest. That might have amounted to one dozen or so units.I've lived in doorman buildings all of my adult life. This examination of these men is downright ridiclous.Irresponsible publishing and packaging."
5,buenas condiciones,Gracias. He comprado varios libros con este vendedor. Llego rápido y está en buenas condiciones!! He comprado varios libros con este vendedor.
5,Red Oak Edge Banding Tape,"I have purchased two rolls of the Red Oak Banding material. We own an upholstery shop, and we used it to clean finish some booths that we made in the shop, after trying a few different methods of installing this product, we found by using a roller made from wood and a heat gun. We had very good success in applying this product. We also set it on so one edge was all that was needed to trim; we did purchase the trimmer made for this product, and we found with a little effort we had good success getting a nice clean edge. We did need to inspect all the edges and in some cases reheating it to get a perfect application. After applying about 500' of this product I can say I would purchase it again if I have another job that needs a finished edge.Chris ErwinSouthside Upholstery and Auto Trim"
2,Sawblade had missing tooth,I have used Delta blades exclusively on my Unisaw and have been very satisfied. This blade had the carbide portion of one of the teeth missing. I'm surprised and disappointed this got by Delta quality control. I guess we all let one get by once in a while.
3,Worthwhile but not the greatest.,"I bought this CD after hearing the song ""Call Me Crazy"" (which, by the way, is the best song on the CD). It's got several good songs, but as usual more slow ones than I care for (but I hate slow sappy sad songs). All in all, a good comeback CD from RVS. A lot better than the poppy crap that seems to have overtaken country music."
5,Super-Best Yet,"I have listened to this tape and think it is the best work, yet, by Ricky Van Shelton. I recommend it to everyone who loves music. This tape really shows off the multiple musical talents of Ricky Van. If you weren't a big fan before, you will be after hearing this one !"
4,Very Good,"I have all of Ricky's CD's. I love his music and I try to attend his local concerts. As for Fried Green Tomatoes; mostly good. However, while The Decision is a great song and I think it is quite meanful to Ricky, I feel it was out of place on this CD. To me, Ricky has the best male voice in country music."
3,Didn't really work,"I have a schnauzer who is hyper active. I thought this spray might calm him down when I have to take him to the vets, the groomers, etc. I carefully followed all the instructions. Can't say that it made my dog any more calm but maybe that's just my dog."
4,Mmmm... Even better in the woods.,I wish it was just a little bigger but then again I have more than 1 sweet tooth.The strawberry *is* very sweet. The chocolate has a good cocoa flavor and the vanilla is on par for what you might expect.It melts in your mouth and does stick to your teeth a bit so some water helps wash it down. I think it's much tastier than the ice cream sandwich although the sandwich seems to be more filling. I like to put the vanilla portion into a cup of hot cocoa sometimes. Makes it silky smooth. Put the strawberry into some bannock or pancakes for a fruity kick. It's more versatile than you might think.Thanks for the time!
3,Its freeze dried. What did you expect?,Its a little too sweet but tolerable. Sticks like super glue to your teeth so drink something warm/hot with it and brush after if possible.
1,Was Very dissapointed,"I received this book as a gift. I'm not a prude - I own many collections of erotic photography. This book - however - I returned. It was really pushing the line to be porn pics. Way too many photos looked like some guy taking bad shots of his naked girlfriend in a hotel room - lighting awful, composition nonexistant. etc. etc. There were a few photos which I thought were well done, but they were greatly outnumbered by others that I'd consider to be more ""trashy"" and ""taseless"" than ""erotic"" any day. You should probably flip through this book at your local book store to see if this is the sort of thing you are interested in - the cover shot by no means represents the work inside the pages."
1,Do not waste the money.,"This book is horribly mis-named. There are no ""masterpieces"".Most images are of such low quality that I can't believe theyhave been published. Some shots are more like pornography thanart. With the exception of one or two acceptable pictures, thisbook is garbage."
3,Good book to add to the collection,"The human body is a perfect masterpiece no matter the size, shape or colour of the subject. This book celebrates just that . . . The joy, the excitement of the nude body. There is nothing pornographic about the pictures. This book includes a large variety of art forms and photographic techniques. This is a good addition to any photography collection. Some may suggest that some fotos are less than masterpiece quality but I beg to differ. There are fotos that are not my personal taste but the art still resonates something inside of me."
1,A very bad book with a nice cover,I got the chance to view through this book and i was very dissapointed. Most of the pictures inside it have no quality at all. Don`t get fooled by its cover.
4,Anyone still think he's paranoid?,"I read this book a couple of years ago, and thought it all sounded plausible, although shocking. I noticed some of the reviewers of his book dismissed him as paranoid, and were insulted by his warnings, taking it as an affront to Islam. After the events of Sept. 11, does anyone want to dismiss him as ""alarmist"" anymore?By and large, Muslims are peaceful people, but to quote directly from the Koran, ""Fight and slay the unbelievers wherever you find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem of war."" (Surah IX:5) It only takes a small percentage of people to take that to an extreme, and even before the attacks on the WTC and Pentagon, evidence around the world abounds that that small but very destructive group of extremists obviously do."
1,Wow! Are American that racists and prejudists OR,"Just look, why do just Americans matter is this world. The same USA that has killed in Iraq. In lebanon in afghanistan pakistan Iran. Why do you hate Muslims. Islam is easily the best religion in the world. Wow! I dont believe all americans are like that are they?"
1,Unreal,"I think it is very unfair to pick and choose words from the koran and take them out of context. The quotes taken about slaying the unbelievers came during a war and the muslims were ordered to fight back. The same lines are in the bible, but do u see muslims writing books like this?"
1,It wasn't worth the money...,"An extremely paranoid view of Islam. A typical ""Muslims are out to blow up the World"" type political thriller that is far from an academic work. The research is deliberately manipulated to make the book 'thrilling to read'. The statistics that the author uses are out dated. Moreover, Mr Dennis needs to study Islamic Law in greater detail as his knowledge of the subject is very limited. The book is interesting to read simply because it feeds on America's deeply enrouted fear of another civilization 'taking over'. Very interesting to read but far from an academic piece."
1,paranoia at it's best,"Mr. Dennis should stick to real history i.e. the American Empire and it's threat to the Muslims. America has long been afraid of Islam and Muslims for they are not people to be easily conquered. This is the nature of Islam, it teaches all it's faithful to stand against oppression and injustice. That is why the U.S. fears Islam. 99.9% of Muslims do not hold violent beliefs, but yet they are judged by what the less than 1% of Muslims do. It's a shame, I guess the Christian world is championed by men like David Koreish, and Jim Jones. Wake Up America, you can be smarter than this. Fear and hate only begets fear and hate. Unfortunately, men like Dennis would rather be become reality."
1,Only for the ignorant,"This book is just full of hate and lies. As a Muslim, i felt extremely upset by his paranoia. He is just attempting to spread his own hate. I wonder if maybe i should write a book entitiled ""christian fundementalism and its threat to the unsaved"". And the the reader below, dont forget what christianity has done to the Muslims, and gypsies,etc.."
2,No need for video,The songs alone are fine. The video is not necessary as it consists of shots of Rocio Durcal in her mature age. The video is of slow scans of her body attempting to make her look sexy. Perhaps she is good looking mature person but the video is not necessary. A plain MP3 or CD would be enough.
2,WHERE DO AUTHORS GET ALL THIS WRONG INFORMATION,I AM FROM BELFAST MYSELF AND I BOUGHT THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT HAS INFORMATION ON THE DEATH OF A RELATIVE. WHEN I READ THIS BOOK I FOUND THERE TO BE A LOT OF LIES IN IT. WHERE DO AUTHORS GET THEIR INFORMATION? WOULD IT NOT BE EASIER FOR THEM TO TALK TO THE RELATIVES OF VICTIMS TO GET THE TRUE STORY. IT SEEMS THAT IF THE AUTHOR DOES NOT KNOW ALL THE DETAILS THEY WILL MAKE THINGS UP AS THEY GO. IT IS VERY MISLEADING AND ALSO HURTFUL FOR RELATIVES TO SEE SUCH FABRICATIONS WRITTEN ABOUT THEIR KIN.
3,Lego Soccer Mania,"The game itself is fun. It has a couple of features that make it more than just a one person game.HOWEVER, due to technical difficulties, this game has not yet been played on our computer that it was meant for due to Vista issues. Tech support has been ok, but the problem is not yet solved."
3,disappointed,I agree with the above review. When you open the large barrel you find a big empty box in the center with the beads packed around the outside so it looks nice and full.The beads are wooden and most are quite large. We made some nice key chains but otherwise my daughters are 7 and 10 and we didn't have alot of fun with these. The beads really aren't anything they would care to wear so a year later we are stinging them as garland just to use them up! Not worth the money.
5,Poetic justification...,"This work is a beautiful piece of narrative poetry, from cover to cover. This pronouncement is prejudicial, coming from a male poet's perspective of an audiotaped edition. I frequently rewound the tape to hear again, in feminine narrator's voice, the elegant, poetic descriptive phrases so well crafted to place the reader/listener into the psyche of the author. I came to this site to buy a hard back copy for a past Poet Laureate of Texas as a gift. I is reminescent of much of her own style of poetry, narrating memories of equal generations of her family's life in the South...different times and different cultures, but both rich and poetic creations."
5,engaging relationship tale!,"Most of the reviews I've been reading of this book have emphasized the folky, lyrical quality of her writing. These aspects are true - the author writes in a poetic and startling voice. But this book also chronicles a destructive but compellingly authentic relationship which offers disturbing yet important lessons for all women. We've all been there, haven't we? This book reminds us of the dark places we all travel to, as well as places of healing and solice available if we open our eyes and look."
4,bubbling mixture of ancient and modern Greece,"A convoluted patchwork novel that entrances the reader with it's poetic narrative. Threads of ancient and modern Greece run silver and gold in this book, complementing each other. The stories of generations of Greek women run together in a spiral circle that leads the reader along. A satisfying and dreamy read."
2,"Entertaining, Yet Unconvincing","Although an overall good read, I felt that this story lacked any real cohesion, closure, or message. As a Greek-American woman, I am offended by shallow attempts at conveying Hellenism through descriptions of food and myths, as it is overdone and often abused. There is much more to discovering one's roots than that. Hence, we have a maudlin, contrived tale which is a bit hard to swallow by many true Greeks. Nonetheless, the story is entertaining, engaging, and readable. It's just too bad that it's so stereotypical."
4,ok board prep,"The book is good. There are some obvious mistakes with editing, like the answer being e. all of the above and the key stating c. The good thing is that it gives a good explanation of why it's that particular answer and why it is not one of the others. I would recommend this book to others to help prepare for upcoming boards with caution to cross check with other references to make sure all answers are right on."
2,Very basic,"This review book is very basic. As stated in the title, this is for technologists. If you're taking ABNM exam, this is totally useless and inadequate."
2,It's Not Good or Bad,"This is the novelization of the movie that stars Jodie Foster, which I have never seen. it's about four friends who live in Los Angeles and are caught between adulthood and childhood.I picked it up used for about fifty cents at a thrift store and it was worth the fifty cents...however, it wouldn't be worth more than one dollar.The writing isn't good, but then it's a book based on a script, so what do you expect?"
3,Not all it could be,"The reviewer named VDIBART makes some excellent points about the book, particularly its lack of maps and the author's tendency to repeat himself. I think the book could have used a better editor, someone who could have tightened up the writing a bit and improved the sourcing, particularly in places where Mr. Boyne is drawing conclusions.Regardless, there is still much to recommend. The book is a valuable work and sheds light on some things that haven't gotten much attention, such as the U.S. airlift."
3,Interesting,"It is quite a reasonable study of the war together with a fasinating discussion on the airlift.Overall, I found the work needs more work. If not for the airlift, Israel would not have perished. Both the Egyptains and Syrians were held before it started. If they had not stopped them then Israel would have had to turn to a nuclear defence.What it did do was allow Israel to inflict a major defeat on the Arab armies!"
4,Reply to M.D. Roberts,"Mr. Roberts states he has problems with the statements made concerning the idea that the war would have been lost if not for US aid in terms of weapons. I cannot agree more and it is an important point considering this book is concerned with the US airlift. The FACT is most of the weapons sent were replacements for those taken out or un-used additions to what was available and in use. Most never saw action. The majority of weapons used were already at hand. The airlift, in effect, increased Israel's available vehicles, artillery, etc. once the cease-fire had been imposed. The air-lift provided needed feelings of security and support more than battlefield resources. I may be off here, but I believe the numbers were around 80% of what was sent was not actually used in that conflict. Mr. Roberts makes a number of other good observations and should be considered by those that read his review."
3,5 mini-adventures,"A five mini-adventures compilation, all are played independently. Only the first two have some connection. It is used as introductory modules for casual players, who don't want to spend much time on D&D. For serious and continuous players, it can only be use when they are too busy to spend much time to play D&D at that day, or their characters need to gain sufficient experience and money before they go for another great adventure. Some of the adventures are quite easy to finish and some of them are rather difficult. Adventures are Fair to Good."
4,Far more interesting than the protocol,"I read this book cover to cover back when I had to deal directly with parsing ASN.1. The book is an interesting read, excellently and expertly written. Moreover, I felt like an expert when I finished reading it; I took my new-found knowledge and applied it to my work at hand. Of course, there are portions of the book that are more theoretical than practical, and I didn't have the tools available to build ASN.1 parsers from rules. However, ASN.1 is important despite the dearth of information on it. This book doesn't merely fill the void - it makes a dry topic interesting."
5,The Perfect Essay,"From little essays big papers can grow: THE CRAFT OF COMPOSITION for argument/research, evaluative/interpretive, explanatory and narrative essays can be applied to make other types of writing better. I like the way Kris Keeney looks at each type of essay: how to get started by figuring out in as few words as possible what to analyze, answer, challenge, or describe; how to keep going when the going gets tough with brainstorming, clustering, freewriting or journaling; how to bring in such topic-developing strategies as cause and effect, classification and division, comparison and contrast, and process analysis; and how to end up with quality final copy by outlining and drafting everything in the order with the most impact and in proper MLA style. The book leads into Sylvan Barnet's A SHORT GUIDE TO WRITING ABOUT LITERATURE, Timothy Corrigan's A SHORT GUIDE TO WRITING ABOUT FILM, Robert Keith Miller's THE INFORMED ARGUMENT, and Deborah Tannen's THE ARGUMENT CULTURE."
4,Managing your Money and Time,"The purpose of this very readable book is to allow a parent to spend more time with their children. The author used her experience in financial journalism to calculate expenses. After surveying more than 100 mothers, she then wrote this book to help other families with young children survive on one income. Most mothers are at home when their children are young. Whatever your reason, this book can help you to spend less on living expenses without pain.This book has four parts. One) to help you analyze your present financial situation and plan for the future. Two) has hundreds of tips to help you cut spending. Three) shows how to save more while earning less. Four) tells you about work: quitting & keeping benefits, part-time work, and how to resume full-time work."
3,good...but...,"I just bought this after all the hype and 5 stars on amazon. I just listened to this 4 times in a row and it is good, not great. The reason for only three stars is that I have all of the Dead Can Dance from 1983-1996. The Swans sound like an angry DCD and the music and vocals are no where near as good. I could tell you 5 different albums to buy fron DCD that are better than this but I won't bother. If you don't know then you never will. If you want beauty, buy DCD. If you want anger, buy Slayer. They do a much better job."
5,Very good piece of writing,"I first read Sabriel about a month ago and since then, I have been searching for a book to fill the gab left in my life since I finished Sabriel. This book almost entirely fills it and I really respect Garth Nix as an author because he can write two very different, although excellent, books and still manage to make a reader content with both. The poor children who die for no reason at all make this book different from Sabriel because in many ways, it is like our world today. The characters are very clever and original. I'ts not everyday you read about a 15 year old who has gold eyes and can see the future every now and then. Although this book has a good ending, it almost made me cry and I was deeply touched by what happened to my favorite characters. I loved this book very much. I can't wait for Garth Nix's next book."
5,BUY THIS BOOK TODAY!,"This was a Great book! it was a page turner, and i couldnt put it down. I am 14 years old. I have reread this book 3 times, and every time it gets better. This book has some sexaul stuff in it, and love interests. It is great how Nix includes romance in a horror/sci-fi novel. This is very good for readers probably 12 and up. Adults will like it to, my dad read it and loved it! thanks lotsalove jenn"
5,wow! I never knew that anyone could write so good!,"Well, what else can i say??? This is obviously the BEST book i have ever read! I think i am going to go out and buy the rest of garth nixs' books!"
5,Tom wrote this,This is seriously the best book I ever read I read it twice but then I lost it but I'm going to buy it again because this is the kind of book you can just read over and over and never get bored with it
3,"Well written, but...","terrifying.Shade's Children, while 'good' in that it is well written and exciting, gives me the same feeling reading Orwell's 1984 did. It's definitely a page-turner sort, but you will get the chills as you read. It's not a scary or horror book in the usual sense, but in terms of sheer quality of evil the bad guys make Darth Vader look like a teddy bear.If this is the sort of book you like, you will love Shade's Children. Otherwise, you may want to pass on it."
5,great book,I read this book in the 8th grade after having heard about it the year before from my 7th grade English teacher. I picked it up and I couldn't put it down for the next week. If you like science-fiction then you'll love this book. This book is thoroughly enjoyable and got me back into reading.
4,Interesting.,"I must admit, I didn't think I'd like this book, but I read it anyway. I mean, I'm not usually one to read about computers and robots and stuff like that, but I was pleasantly surprised. Though it didn't confuse me all that much, I can see how it could. If you're not engage enough in the book to either look at each word carefully or read sentences you don't quite understand more than once, your sure to end up confused, I'll tell you that. This is one of those books that requires your full attention in order for you to like it. So even if your not one to like this kind of sci-fi, read it anyway. You may turn out to like it."
4,A frightening and intriguing book,"Nix, Garth. Shade's Children.Summary: It is some time in the future, 15 years after ""the Change"", and life as we know it is over. After destroying all the adults, the ""Overlords"" keep children and use their brains and muscles to create creatures, which are used to fight ritualistic battles and also to hunt the children who manage to escape. Gold Eye, an escaped child who has narrowly eluded the hunters for years, is rescued by a group of survivors working to overthrow the intruders. They are directed and trained by Shade - a phantom, not really a man.Evaluation: I read this book in one sitting - it was interesting and well written. The character development was lacking, but the plot made up for it. Even though it was shelved in the ""young teen"" section of the library, I would be careful when recommending such a violent and potentially scary book. The world that Nix creates is fascinating and imaginative - I was sorry when I finished it."
3,"Disappointing, especially if you've read the Sabriel trilogy","This is a great concept executed in mediocre style. The story has good bones, but the writing feels haphazard, even sloppy. Too little character development - and too much detail on the various creatures inhabiting this futuristic world - left me feeling as though I'd picked up a product manual instead of a novel, and ultimately quite emotionally uninvested in the characters' fate.Bottom line: If you've already read his other books, pick this one up with a grain of salt; and if this is your first Garth Nix novel, don't let it put you off his other works."
3,A Non-SciFi Lover's Review,"Even though I'm not a big fan of the sci-fi genre, I am glad I read it.The ending was bittersweet, but well thought out and extremely appropriate. To view my full review, please go to [...]"
4,"I thought Garth Nix's ""Shades Children"" was freaky+cool.",It was cool because it was designed for young readers. I also liked the fact that the author took an unbelievable subject and made cool and exciting for young readers. I most definitely reccommend this book not for just young readers but for readers of all agess.
5,"A page-turning, nail-biting, edge of your seat thriller.","A great book. Character developement is superb, depth is great, and the twist and turns that Nix spits out is sure to keep you from geting bored. A must read."
4,Four and a half stars,"Shade's children is an interesting delve into what happens when children grow up too quickly. Massacred en masse at the age of seventeen (unless used for breeding) children are fighting to reach their adult years. Noone knows where the adults went, but in their place ""overlords"" have come to assail the planet.But there are some who escape, some who can save the rest. These are ""Shade's Children"". They fight to keep eachother, and themselves, alive while attempting to save others from the ""meat factory"".These novel is filled with twists and turns, and you is a must-read for anyone who can read science fiction. I am fifteen and loved it, so maybr you will too."
3,"Ok, but not great","I didn't enjoy this as much as Sabriel. I was rather disappointed, I really connected with Sabriel but not with the characters in Shade's Children. In fact I really dislike Shade."
4,"Pretty Good, but it can't compare with SABRIEL","This book has a great beginning that really catches your attention and a good ending, but the middle gets kind of old. I'm sure a lot of people really like this book, but its not my favorite."
3,my review,"in the bood Shade's childrewn, a boy by the name of gold-eye has just turned 14 years old and is being chased by overlrds who want to kill him and use his body parts for his creatures. the overlords do not allow for any boy to live past their 14th b-day. gold-eye is saved by three kids by the name of ella, drum and ninde. together they try to defeat the overlords and save man-kind. the four of them are trained and sheltered by a man named shade. at the end of the book the kids are faced with a tuff decision that could result in death. definitely a must read for all science-fiction lovers."
2,"Boring, predictable, and cliched","I read this book going on other people saying it was a must-read for science fiction fans. However, other than some big words and all the electronics and machinery, I don't see how this qualifies. I was consistently bored with the story, and I did not have any feel for the characters. I also found it sadly predictable and very cliched. Nix also overuses sex in the book; it's fairly obvious from the beginning that this book is not intended for serious readers."
5,Outstanding I loved it,"When i borrowed this book from a friend at school i had no idea it would be so wonderful. My first Nix novel but definently not my last. The way that he brings out the personalities of Gold-eye, Ella, Ninde, and Drum is really fantastic. A real stay up till 2 in the morning book. I started reading it and liked it so much that i finished it in no time and had to return it(sadly).I recomend this book to any one, young or old. You won't be disapointed."
5,Nix's Books,"I realy enjoy all of Garth Nix's books, I love the style of writing and the way the books flow. I can't wait for Nix's next book to come out!"
5,Garth Nix has HIT Gold with this Incredible Book,"Shade's Children is the most amazing book I have ever read. This book truly deserves six stars!! Garth has such a great way of keeping you on the edge of your seat, the whole WAY. If you have read the Harry Potter Books I guarantee that you will like Nix's book many times over.I also RECOMMEND, Sabriel, Lirael Daughter of the Clayr, and The Seventh Tower series for slightly younger oudiences. I have read all of these books and will be reading The Ragwitch sooooon!!! :->"
5,A Limited Scope Novel gives you many interesting questions,"Wonderful novel, sparsely written with appropriate details to the reactions of children in times of war. The heroic aspects of the story follow in traditions of fantasy novels with interesting concepts of enslavement. I was drawn in by the tale, much to my own surprise, asking many questions right until the very end. The author does leave you hanging, not really answering the origin questions, but within the context of the story giving an ending with a glimpse toward the future. This isn't just for young adults, it is high quality sceince fiction."
5,I LOVE this book!,"When I first picked up Shade's children at my school library, I figured it would just be another one of the books I devour but I couldn't put it down which isn't rare for me but what is strange is that even after I finished it I had to read it again and again...and then sadly it disappeared from the school library and I didn't see it anywhere for nearly 7 months. But now I have it again! This is a truly touching story, one of the first books that actually made me cry. This book is as close to perfect as a book can get. It has every thing...adventure, computers, danger, creativity, and even a love story."
3,"Interesting book, at best","The story was significantly dark and interesting enough to be worth the time. In the end, it was a little too short and the plot a little too shallow to be perfect. A good book, definitely, but that's about it."
4,Sure it's disturbing. That's all the fun.,"Yes, this book is disturbing. All adults gone, kids harvested for parts, death everywhere. But that chill is the beauty of the work. While I read this book at when I thought i would be too old for the writing, I was still too young for the content. I have to admit practically crying at the end. This book moved me in such a way that I was freaked, yet inspired. Hey, that's good writing."
5,My Review,"Shades Children was an awesome book, full of action. Every page has a new adventure awaiting, and a new surprise. I love this book because its given a look into what the future could be like, most likely not, but its cool to hear someone elses point of view of the future. I definetly recomend this book to anyone who likes fantasy and stuff. And also if anyone has read either Lirael or Sabriel, youll wanna read Shade's Children too. Its better then any of the books that Garth Nix has ever written."
5,THIS BOOK WAS GREAT!!!,"I wasn't sure I would like this book at first... but boy was I wrong! I didn't read this book by choice, I had to read it for a teen book discussion group at the lbrary. From the first chapter on, I couldn't put it down! I started the book on September 7 and I had read the whole thing TWICE by September 9. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story with lots of plot twists and action."
3,Not as good as expected...,"The premise of the story is interesting. All kids die by their 14th birthday. However, as I read on, the character development wasn't great and i didn't find myself caring about the characters. The storyline was creative and its definitely a decent scifi novel but it does miss the mark of being really great. I would say ok is the best I can give it."
5,"Dark, twisted, compelling","I've read a few of Garth Nix's books, though I haven't read the famed Sabriel yet, and this book is very different from the others I've read (Keys to the Kingdom / The Seventh Tower), but just as good. It's a one-shot novel. It's very twisted, pretty dark and violent, and (though I don't remember them a few people in other reviews have mentioned it...so seek them for more) a few sexual themes. It challenges teens to understand responsibility and the plights of others as well as consider the idea of solidarity and what we owe to others. Though there are some (I think) wonderfully effed up aspects, the overall message, as I remember it, is one of perserverence, friendship, and teamwork/solidarity."
3,Not Really Enough Like The Old Kingdom Series To Merit Purchasing,"Compared to the Old Kingdom series, I found this book to be only just barely good enough to finish, which is surprising, since the other Garth Nix books I have read have been excellent, so certainly the potential is there."
2,Not Recommended,"When I read this book I found it only mildly entertaining. Generally, it's about some super-hero children trying to save the world, and off course they doand everything is happily ever after. All around, this book is unrealistic, dull, and contains gross content that is totally irrelevant to the plot and could be removed without taking away from the story. This is not one of Garth Nix's better books. If you want to read something decent by this author, try Sabriel, Lirael, or Abhorsen. But Shade's Children is just a waste of your time."
2,Nice scenes - disjointed presentation format,"This DVD does have some nice scenes, however single scenes sometimes stay on for as long as three minutes. For example, the opening scene is looking at the Golden Gate Bridge from a walking birds eye view on the beach - for three minutes. The waves are only about 3 inches high. And I really don't need a flock of seaguls walking up and looking into the camera.The biggist problem is that the DVD is divided into seven separate ""days,"" with the same redundant view of palm trees followed by very annoying computer graphics rolling into view at the beginning of each new section. It is guaranteed to wake you up and annoy you if you were starting to relax. And almost all of it was shot from the same very low point of view, withought ever giving you a real perspective on the scenery."
1,Terrible,"I have used loctite glue and it wasn't bad but this adhesive just doesn't stick. It will hold a little bit, but it isn't something I would ever try to use again. This stuff just doesn't stick. Do not buy this if you are putting up paneling. It won't work well."
4,"""This is what Invisible is all about.""","In Dust We Trust starts out with a powerful version of X-Lover by Sheep On Drugs, which is by far one of the best remixes I have ever heard. This compilation is a very good example of what Invisible is all about. Songs by Test Dept, Pigface, Lick, Evil Mothers, and of course Martin Atkins help to make this one of my favorite Cd's to date."
4,Nice little watch,"I needed a watch just for doing some exercising and when camping, but didn't need anything really fancy...just something that could do the basics and not spend a lot. I've had the watch for almost two years and its still going strong. Very easy to size and for the price, it has been a great investment. I'd definitely recommend to a friend."
5,wonderful machine!,"I received this as a birthday gift. It is AWESOME! It comes with 16 sample coffees. It is easy to use, the frother makes wonderful frothy milk if you want it, or you can use a different attachment to steam the milk. It is the best latte I've ever had. My husband doesn't drink coffee, so it is so nice that I can make myself one cup in the morning, and not a coffee ground to deal with! I'd rate it 10 stars if I could!"
1,Beware,"This version - on Esperanto/ESP8052 - it also says M.I.L (Multimedia) on the back of the cd, is a BOOTLEG and very poorly recorded. There is a split second of music missing on the incredible track ""Shakara"" at the 1:25 mark and it throws the rhythm off track at that point in the song. VERY ANNOYING.Absolutely purchase Fela Kuti's music. But stay away from bootlegs like this."
1,Not worth the money or time,I returned this product and purchased the Bona cleaner for laminate and tile floors because the Granite Gold had to be diluted in a bucket of water and did not clean as advertised.
3,The beauty of grey,"3 1/2BR found their own damaged melodies with this album, perhaps the first of their great work. Infusing their minor-key melodicism with better written songs and a more focused approach, the band offered another emotional mope-fest, replacing the abrasiveness with catchiness."
4,"Dark, ominous, delicious.","I listened to the album for the first time through on headphones this morning and it sounded to me like the last songs of a Hallowe'en dance at a high school in the 1980's -- leaves swirling in the dusk and a half-smoked, hastily-discarded cigarette smouldering in the garbage bin in the girl's washroom. Uneasy -- the potential for something bad to happen."
5,The tale of eternity,"This writing takes you on a journey with the deceased priest Bishop Martin. The day that Bishop awakes, he finds himself not in heaven, nor in hell, nor in anything of which he was accustomed to hearing while he was alive on earth. Instead he enters into a world of nothingness. Alone with his thoughts, almost everything that the bishop experiences on his journey is an aberration of his very desires. Soon he is met by others who are there to test him and help him along his way to becoming a perfected spirit. A very emotional and gripping tale with stunning and lasting imagery of a beyond fairytale nature, this story whether taken as truth or fiction will probe your innermost and raise some very contemplative philosophical, religious and scientific questions and perhaps answers to the age old questions of life and death."
3,"Interesting, not well-written","This book is quirky and apparently no editor thought to correct that. The history seems to jump around chronologically and syntax makes some sentences hard to understand. Still, it's a fascinating topic and there are some wonderful photos. I would like to have seen more photos of how each technique of lace-making is performed."
1,didn't fit,"I should be more annoyed at Hampton Bay for not selling a frickin bulb they standardize on. My 4 year old expensive ceiling fan lights are out, top and bottom, the 'supposed' replacement from westinghouse was a waste of time. I doubled the order and bought 2 main lights and 4 second lights, 2 out of the six never lit, bad starter. none - NOT one actually fit into the fan, you just pushed them in and they fell right out again. Again, bad design on the fan but WH should have known this. It cost me about $25 in restocking and shipping. AVOID....."
1,Very Disappointed,"you wouldn't think I would ever need to give a light bulb a poor review however this burned out after only 3 weeks of use...it's for my bedroom light, I might have gotten a total of 5 hours use out of it. I am replacing the light so that I don't have to deal with these bulbs anymore."
3,Where's the light?,"Delivery was great, fast, and product arrived without incident. The light is exactly the correct size and luminosity is terrific.But, when you flip the light switch, there is a considerable delay before the light comes on. Flip the switch, walk three quarter of the way into the room, stub your toe, all before the light comes on. From that standpoint I could only rate this as three stars."
4,Almost perfect.,"I bought this squeegee to go along with a 10 by 14 inch screen. For the screen size, it's a slightly smaller than what I probably should have purchased. Luckily, I use the paper stencil method, so I only need an 8 inch squeegee. Soon, I think we will uprgrade to a 10 inch one, once I make some new stencils that are a little larger. But the squeegee works great, it cleans up well. Overall, I do like it. One thing I must point out though, you get what you pay for. This squeegee will most likely fall apart in a few months. Since it's inexpensive, I don't have a problem with that. Good luck to those who buy it, I think you'll appreciate it. HAPPY SCREENING"
4,A good guide for beginners,I teach a beginning French course and this is the best low-priced study guide that I have found. It would be better if there were an accompanyingpronunciation DVD for those who want to use the book without a teacher.
3,Works great..... BUT,"And it's a big but!!! (pun intended). The timer is like the old egg timers... after you rotate the dial to set the timer, it rotates to the end and ""Dings"". In the three months we have had this toaster, we have almost started three fires... In essence, the timer runs down, but hangs up before the ding and auto-off.... Pretty dangerous glitch imho... So - if you are willing to supervise, it works like a charm. Otherwise, beware!"
3,A meatier starter book than the string class primers,"I suggest Strictly Strings Book 2 and ""The Green Violin: Theory, Ear Training, and Musicianship for Violinists"" for motivated students. This combination moves your playing forward fast, and you get to add folk songs from all over the world to your repertoire."
5,Strictly Strings Violin Book 2,"I am a music teacher and bought this for a student. This is an excellent series of books for beginning violinists who are not familiar with music notation, and want to learn about reading music notation at the same time as starting violin. As a violin teacher I can say this book has always worked well for my students."
4,Handy Reference....easy read,"I recd. this book as a joke gift (a Palm user gave it to me after I bought my iPAQ).When I started using my iPAQ, I didn't have many questions or problems.... which is good because it didn't come with ~any~ reference material! I think Compaq was taken off guard by the iPAQ's popularity!Eventually, I did find that I was curious about how to do some advanced tasks with the iPAQ. Since Compaq didn't have a reference guide, I opened up my ""joke gift"" and found this book to provide basic information to match my needs.If you want detailed instructions or want to read advanced topics, this book is NOT for you. This book is perfect for the new ""handheld"" user. I also recommend keeping this book in your library for a reference guide (if you have an iPAQ) since none was provided with the product."
2,Almost useless,"I won a PocketPC recently, which I have fallen in love with. The first day I had it, I looked at a few books and chose this one. Inside the cover, it had a date of 2001, not 2000, so it seemed newer than most of the other books I found. Apparently, 2001 is a reprint date, as the majority of the info is old and useless.The book is not completely ..., as it did help me get around the PocketPC. However, most of the info it helped on, I could have figured out with a bit more experimentation. If I decide I need another book, I may go for the Microsoft Press book. It is about half the price and seems about as complete."
4,a title,product arrived on time and fit with no modifications. installation in less than 2 hours. The product lives up to the hype and does provide increased power and MPG.
4,An invaluable book comparing two great painters.,Van Gogh and Millet is an excellent book comparing the works of Vincent van Gogh with those of the painter that had a huge influence on him: Jean-Francois Millet. This interesting and well researched book is a must for any Van Gogh scholar and is now of particular interest with Van Gogh and Millet retrospectives taking place around the world. The graphics are excellent and help to make this a fine resource for any arts enthusiast.
5,DJ Icey zags and zigs through a phenomenal mix of breaks.,"This is a very diverse and explosive breakbeat mix. From soulful and reggae sounds, to rap, to disco, and even to a vocal track sounding very reminiscent of freestyle. Icey covers it all in an exciting and very energetic mix. Tracks 7 through 11 really heat up, with General Midi's breakbeat rap, and then onto Dj Icey's own new sexy track, Come Closer, complete with breathy female vocals. Even past track 11, right to the end of the mix, it's high energy, pounding beats. I can't recommend this one enough. It's a winner from top to bottom, without a dull track in sight. Also check out the Drumattic Twins new breaks mix CD, Finger Lickin Export 01."
5,Doesn't everyone love the Masterharper?,"This is a great CD, it was the first one I bought many years ago, and it is still a favorite now. The songs use the exact words that Anne McCaffrey wrote in her books and put them to music that is exactly as I imagined it whould be. The Masterharper of Pern CD is a great contribution to the collection of any Anne McCaffrey fan."
2,cd masterharper of pern,Am loving the first half of the cd but the last four songs would not load or play. Was very disappointed as I had been looking forward to hearing them. Would have returned it but had already disposed of packing slip and materials.
5,Wonderful info,"This was such a great addition to Husband Coached Childbirth! It went a bit more in-depth about why the Bradley Method is so great, compared to other options. I wish I had read it before all of my births, not just the last one. Susan gives some great information about how you might feel in each stage of labor and how to deal with those emotions (for the mother and her coach). Its a great book to read if you are interested in Natural Childbirth!"
5,"needs updated pictures, but timeless information","I am still reading this book and preparing for delivery in a few months, but it has taught me so much more than some of the other books out there. Even some things that I didn't learn in nursing school!! It has good exercises and coping methods, and I have all my faith that it will help guide me though a drug free labor!"
4,Best Reads on Birthing Mechanics,"This book has the best chapters on Sexuality and Pregnancy as well as the mechanics of birthing that I've read -- and I've been through quite a few books recently. I would highly recommend it to any reader interested in a sound knowledge of the ""how-to"" of birth."
2,"The book, not the method.","Bradley Method - A++++.McCutcheon's instructional book? - C-.She's not thorough enough with rationale, and gets a bit too scattered and melodramatic. A definite feeler-oriented book, as opposed to thinker-oriented book. If you get galvanized by an activist who likes to play victim, then this book is for you.I recommend the Bradley Method very highly. I simply wanted a better book about it."
2,Very Dated,"I'm only about half way though, but not currently impressed. As mentioned, there are some good relaxation techniques, however, the diet portion is basically eat lots of protein to sustain energy and maintain blood sugar levels, the exercises are nill to none for anyone whose not completely sedentary, and much of the hospital info is very dated. In short, it didn't do much for me."
3,Naked Photos Necessary?,"I bought this book for my son (who was delivered by Dr. Bradley) and his wife. My son didn't want to read the book because of the photos of the woman with the largest nipples in the world, as he called it.I had all 5 of my babies the Bradley method, and never once was I completely naked. I find that the photos distract from the reading.The information in the book is good. I even learned a couple of things that I didn't know!"
3,Good but needs updating,"This is an informative book about natural childbirth, and if you don't already have a stock of such books, but all means buy it. However, the tone regarding hospitals and medical procedures is somewhat extreme and outdated. Those of us who are committed to natural childbirth don't need to read exaggerated criticisms of doctors. Take some of it with a pinch of salt and question your doctor carefully. Hospital classes are not all designed to persuade women to conform to being given IVs, pitocin, drugs and episiotomies - in fact, my hospital class did the opposite. It's a shame that the author makes such sweeping generalisations about hospitals, as it tends to detract from the valid arguments that she makes. For example, I've not heard of anyone strapped to the table to give birth these days! It's time that this book was updated. Skip the exaggerated descriptions of hospitals and Lamaze, and read the book for the positive information about natural birth."
2,A little too much pressure for me!,"This is an informative, eye-opening book about labor and delivery. I am glad that I read this book as I feel it prepared me for what my body would be going through during labor and delivery. However, I felt that the book placed too much emphasis on having a natural, drug free delivery no matter what. This book gives you one point of view - no drugs, no intervention. After reading this book, I felt inspired to go natural, however, that wasn't possible for me. Medical intervention was necessary for my health and the health of my baby. So, when things didn't progress ""naturally"" as this book told me they would, I felt somewhat like a failure. Keep in mind that this book deals with the best case scenario and every delivery is unique. Read this book to inform yourself, but keep an open mind about your birth and trust your OWN instincts instead of this author's ideas and expectations."
1,If I wanted a sermon I'd go to church...,"I found this book one-sided and preachy. They dismiss all other methods of childbirth as inferior, and imply that if you don't follow their method you're inferior too.I hope to have a natural childbirth, but it certainly won't be due to the Bradley Method! A far better choice is The Birth Book by Drs. William and Martha Sears."
1,Please don't follow the ideas in this book,"After 26 hours of labor the doctor finally convinced me that we had to sucction my baby out. I had studied the bradley book and method and really believed in it. I was so sure that there was no such thing as a dry birth...but there certainly is. I also remembered not to give up because the baby may be born just minutes after the doctor has intervened, so I really ""hung in there"" sure that I could do it. My point is... find adoctor that you trust and listen to him or her. I hope that I can help others to avoid the nightmare birth experience that I had with my daughter."
5,Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way,"This is a tremendous book. It is the best childbirth coaching book I have read. My sister lent it to me a few days before I had my first daughter and it was the only source that helped me understand what I needed to do and how important it is to relax, breath and work with rather than against your body. I was able to have a fully natural, easy birth with no medication. I had to re-read this book before having my next kids and I recommend it to everyone I know!"
4,Natural Childbirth is Possible,"A few friends reccommended this method when I was pregnant. I had never heard of it but decided to look into it. Myself and my husband (coach) reviewd the book a few times a week and practiced some of the methods. We were not die-hard students but felt we had a good handle on the methods so it wasn't too time-consuming for us. When the day came and I started labor I stuck it out from 3am to 7 pm at my house. The contractions became more intense and I knew I wanted to be comfortable at my house vs the hospital. We focused on breathing and relaxing through the contractions. When I went to the hospital I was already 8 centimeters so drugs were not an option. The book gave me a good idea what to expect and work through pain which seemed much more manageable than I had anticipated. So yes, I am one of the Bradley statistics in which I was drug free and proud."
5,It works!,"The visualization and relaxation taught in this book absolutely work. Although childbirth was intense, I did not experience it as ""pain"" but as pressure and stretching exactly as the book described.Those who found the hospital criticism overly harsh or outdated must have been at a different hospital than the one where I gave birth. The Drs there intervened without my permission, bullied me and gave me outright wrong advice. I believe that the main reason I didn't wind up with (unnecessary) ceasarean surgery is because I read this book cover to cover."
5,Beautiful Delivery,"I delivered my daughter after having read this book and it was such a help to both my husband and me. The techniques are straight forward and make sense and I found it very easy to recall what to do at any given point in the labor. I loaned my last copy out so many times, I am buying a new one!"
2,Poorly Written. Good Information.,"This book is often cited as a definitive resource. I'd say its age is showing. That is, attitudes around natural childbirth have changed a lot since this was first written. I believe for the better. This book has an underlying preachy and condescending tone, as if it is trying to cajole readers into aligning with the authors view. I'm converted. Most readers are at least receptive to the idea of natural childbirth being a reasonable and viable choice for expectant mothers. The attitude is not called for and is distracting."
5,A must read,"Like most women who were pregnant for the first time, I read a lot of books. This book was the only one that truly and honestly prepared me for labor and birth. I loved the short sections for the husband/coach at the end of the chapters. It made it easier for my husband to read.If it is important to you to have a natural birth, this book is a must read."
4,Great resource,"This was a great resource to read. It helped me become knowledgeable about different aspects of labor and delivery, so I was more informed about things that were happening to me and my baby!"
2,Expected much better. Very dated.,"I bought this book after a friend recommended it and had used the information (not the method) to have a natural homebirth. I was expecting a lot more. The information was general and very dated. There were a few things to learn, but I found the narrative to be narrow-minded and theoretical (vs. medical). The layout was a little confusing, ie. there are three phases of X ... and then no list of the phases.I found ""Preparation for Birth"" far superior. While it is Lamaze based (not Bradley based), the information is relevant for any birth."
3,Got very turned off by their trashing the Lamaze method.,I actually ended up not reading too much of this book simply because in their first chapter which compares Lamaze to Bradley they just TRASHED Lamaze! And they made many assertions which are untrue. So -- the method may be valuable but the messenger in this case was pretty insulting.
3,I'm not sure about this book,"Some of the advice seems peculiar, and honestly I don't understand why every illustration has to be of a naked woman. It may just be me, but the relaxation suggestions in this book really don't work for me. I found it worked better for me to use breathing exercises which is contrary to what is in this book! It was helpful in some areas, but not others. Not sure I would recommend it to others."
5,very pleased,Item arrived very quickly in the condition advertised (new) . I am very pleased and would definitely use this seller again without a doubt!
1,I threw this evil book away!!!,"I usually donate or share books when I am done using them, however this one was so outdated, sexist and evil that I recycled it to avoid passing it on to others. I was trying to prepare for natural childbirth using the Bradley method, but I found this information to be extremely biased and negative towards any opinions other than those presented by the writer. References towards traditional hospital procedures tying a mother to the bed for the delivery were incredibly inaccurate and obviously geared to scare an uneducated mother. I delivered a 9lb 2.4 oz baby naturally and it was hard, but this book was of no assistance what so ever."
2,Not My Favorite,"I liked Husband-Coached Childbirth much better. This one spent so much time telling me why everything else was bad, rather than selling me on why this one was good."
5,awesome book,Purchased for my son and daughter-in-law (on recommendation from my daughter).It absolutely helped them prepare for the birth of their daughter. My daughter raves about this book
3,a serious commitment,"I bought this book hoping to pick up some tips on making birth easier, along with information on the birthing process to help me become better informed. While the book does a great job of explaining birth, it is not the best option for those women looking for additional help - it promotes a serious commitment to the Bradley method, including weeks and weeks of Bradley classes. In short, while informative, this book is really aimed at women intent on practicing the Bradley method who have plenty of time to devote to finding Bradley classes, along with doctors/midwives who are comfortable with the method."
5,A must!,"I read this book after reading ""Husband Coached Childbirth"" and while that one gives you a good base for the Bradley Method, this one gives you detailed practical information in an easy to read format. I dont know what I would do without this book!!"
3,"good labor and relaxation info, dated hospital info","For a book that was revised in 1996, the information about hospital practices is very dated, and the author is antagonistic towards hospital personnel. As a labor and delivery nurse I know of no hospital (in my area at least) that straps a woman to a delivery table or condones the ""routine"" use of episiotomies and assisted births (forceps or vacuum). Also, rooming in (mom and baby not being separated) is the norm, rather than the exception. The descriptions of what happens pysiologically during labor and delivery are good and I find the relaxation information helpful, not only for my next birth, but to help the mom's I'm working with relax. Get the book, skip the skewed views on hospitals and medical personnel or get the low down on the hospital you'll birth in from several people who have birthed in the same hospital"
5,This book helped me a lot,"I couldn't take a Bradley class, so I got this book, among others, and read and practiced the techniques. When my first birth got complicated, I knew enough not to be afraid. My second birth was easy and drug-free, using this method. You don't need to be afraid of hospital personnel, as this book implies-- just get an idea of what to talk to your doctor about. This book helped me feel well-informed and able to take charge of our health care."
5,very educational,My husband and I are taking the Bradley classes for natural childbirth and this book was required reading. It is easy to read and very educational. The book is realistic (doesn't claim to make childbirth painless) and detailed. I would highly recommend it to anybody expecting whether or not natural childbirth is your goal.
3,"Great info., but needs updating","I will be a first-time mom soon, and I found this book to be very helpful. Unfortunately, it's fairly outdated in all of the research and statistics it quotes. I think the most recent research was from 1995. Obviously a lot has been learned about the effects of c-sections, speeding up labor with drugs, etc. in the last seventeen years. I kept saying to myself as I was reading, ""I'm sure that was common practice then, but how about now?"" Still, for someone who wants to have a natural birth but who knows very little about what to expect during labor, this book is definitely worth reading."
4,Helped my wife a lot,"My wife and I decided to use the Bradley Method after the recommendation of a friend. I read Husband Coached Childbirth and my wife read this one. She found it very helpful, even-handed, and informative.Initially I was very hesitant to accept the method, but the classes won me over, and the book helped my wife prepare in a big way, and that is most important to me."
3,Keep an open mind!,"This book was both good and bad.Good because it gives readers detailed descriptions and pictures of what a woman's body goes through during each of the 3 stages of labor. It even goes as far as giving an emotional map of what the woman will be going through and how her coach (or husband) can reassure her.Bad because the premise of it is that childbirth should be natural and drug free. In keeping true with this belief, the book almost uses scare tactics to convince women that accepting even the lowest dose of anethesia can be harmful to her. As a first time mom-to-be who has no point of reference when it comes to labor, after reading this book, I was truly afraid of anything that nurses/doctors would offer me to minimize pain should it occur.Should you decide to purchase this book, I really recommend you also get another perspective on the birthing without medication issue, preferably something that does not scare you so you can make an informed decision when the time comes."
3,It was alright..,"This book has some good information but felt outdated. The material was very dry and overall just boring. However, there are some good tips on how to relax during contractions and ways your partner can help. In the end though I wound up buying a different book to supplement with as I just go too bored reading this one."
3,Kind of outdated,"Some good information about natural childbirth, but outdated. Argues against proceedures that aren't common anymore. Doesn't discuss newer trends. Spends a lot of time panning lamaze."
2,Inaccurate information about Lamaze,"McCutcheon notes literature on Lamaze that is between 20 and 30 years old. For over a decade Lamaze has embraced a philosophy of birth that views birth as normal and natural, that builds women's confidence in their ability to give birth normally without routine interventions. Lamaze is NOT a technique of rigid breathing exercises, self massage, and following hospital policies. It is rather preparation for birth that brings women to a deep trust in her own abilities, learning ways to find comfort in response to contractions, actively working with the pain of labor -- in whatever way makes sense and feels right at the time. Husbands, family and friends do not ""Coach"" women in labor -- they encourage, and support throughout labor. Many sections of Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way are valuable, but the information constrasting Bradley with Lamaze is outdated and simply wrong. This book is in serious need of updating."
2,It felt preachy,"I started looking into natural child birth methods realizing that natural medicine and conventional medicine often butt heads, but I was surprised at how bitter the author is towards conventional medicine. I had a general idea of what I was trying to avoid in a doctor and the hospital I am going to give birth in, but she honestly scared me. I also have to say that a few of the things she said have no scientific basis or are outright wrong. I was looking for a book that just explained what the Bradley method was and advantages to the method. This was not the book. There are sections that explain the method, but they are relatively few and far between and she tends to be very condescending of any other method out there. I like the general idea behind the method, but this book was a real turn-off for me. I would suggest Ina May's book, it actually has useful information in the second half and isn't nearly so scary."
2,Not for me,"I bought this book as an intro to Bradley as I am planning to do an unmedicated birth. After reading through it I decided it was not the method for me due to it's being rather strict and inflexible about what the only way to cope is. If that one ""perfect"" position for relaxation winds up not working for you, what do you do then? They don't offer any alternatives to it. The support partner has a very strictly defined role which may be a relief for some husbands but if it winds up not being exactly what your wife needs in labor what then? It's a short read and it isn;t an expensive one so check it out by all means if you are curious but if you want fexibility and adaptability this doesn't seem to be the way to go."
3,good but some old/biased information,"This book is well laid out and easy to follow. It bashes all OBGYN's who we are still going to need in emergency situations. And I thought their opinion of Nurse midwives is off. This description of them may have been true in 1996 but it is not correct for all nurse midwives now. Word to the wise, take this book with a grain of salt and interview the nurse midwife before making assumptions."
2,Disappointing,"I had heard a lot about the Bradley method as I progressed through my pregnancy, but I was unable to find a class in my area. This book was a disappointing alternative. The first half is essentially why every other method is wrong. The author has a tendency to harp on about Lamaze and traditional midwife methods in favor of the only right way. I'm glad I read the book, but borrow it from the library. Don't waste your money."
3,Great information for those interested in birthing naturally,"This is a great book for those interested in giving birth naturally. Combined with a series of childbirth classes this book helped my husband and I labor naturally for over 50 hours. I do feel however, it can give high expectations to parents and could cause feelings of failure if medical intervention ends up being necessary. The Bradley Method followers tend to feel their way is the only way. Further research into other childbirth alternatives is recommended so an informed decision can be made."
3,He's OK,"The album is OK. Nothing to get excited about but quite easy to listen to. He is, however, a talented pianist."
3,Mega Bloks..not so Mega...,....Toy was a bit disappointing....not much to build with this toy...I would not buy again for my son.
3,Read the Book First!,"This film is a great documentary with wonderful archival and contemporary footage of Clara Rockmore and Leon Theremin playing the instrument. After reading Albert Glinsky's biography, Theremin: Ethermusic & Espionage, this film brings another dimension to many of the people in that book.Sadly, ""this film has been reformatted to fit your television...""This means that the identifying text of who's speaking on camera is missing, translations of interviews in Russian go unseen, and a good deal of explanatory information is lost. You can resort to the subtitles if you read French or Spanish though!If the production quality were up to par with the original content, this DVD would be a 5. Amazon doesn't give an option of 2.5 stars which what I'd rate it if I could.It's not mediocre, it's just disappointing."
5,Interesting,"I found the history of the Theremin and a look at the lives of the people involved with the Theremin to be very interesting.This video sparked my curiosity enough to see all the movies with Theremin music that I can find, and buy some CDs of Theremin music.I was fascinated with Clara Rockmore. She was able to pry excellent, creative music from a very hard to play, musical instrument.The life of Leon Theremin is also very interesting.This video also caused me to explore the music of Bernard Herrmann, and I have listened to everything composed by him that I can get my hands on. His use of the Theremin duet in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" shows his superb creativity and understanding of music that creates mood and feelings.I found this video to be very entertaining and informative, and anyone that loves history, biographies, and Theremin music, should love it also."
5,Damn good,"Well if you like the theremin, this is an absolute must have. This movie is so entertaining and tells you so much, all you wanna know. It's worth every penny. Next step I'm gonna buy me a theremin!"
4,Theremin-An Electronic Odyssey,"This was an impulse buy, and I am not sure what I was expecting. This is a documentary about the early years of electronic music and the invention and developoment of the theremin. We meet Leon Theremin and his protege Clara Rockford and witness there re-unification after Theremin was allowed to leave the Soviet Union. It was interesting to watch them perform on the Theremin, but the latter half of the movie is disappointing as Leon & Clara are both so old that I am wondering what I am watching. Leon falls asleep in a taxi on camera at one point. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in the history of electronic music."
3,"Fascinating story, poorly told","Anyone ever heard of an EDITOR?When this story was good, it was spellbinding, and when it wasn't, it was a waste of time. What was with that uncut Brian Wilson interview and what meds did he forget to take that day?The story was choppy and lacked depth. Another reviewer mentioned the uncut version and maybe that one made more sense."
3,not bad but too speedy,It started as a good book letting the lerner take his time especially for beginners . Then it was too fast and there was alot of vocabulary. You will get lost somewhere in the middle and will jump to long articles with not enough explanation. The audio CD is good in teaching pronunciation but it was not enough and did not include all topics. Some chapters were not included at all inthe audio CD
3,A Good Resource,"This book is a good start for those who are serious about learning Farsi. The introduction to the language's script is very good, as well as the pronunciation guide and the examples on the CDs. My only qualm is the speediness of the course. A dictionary is recommended with this book because some words used in the dialogues are not in the index. It is definitely better than the older edition of this book by John Mace."
3,"Decent, but could be a lot better","For the price, it's a good deal if you get the CDs. But like all TY books, it goes very quickly, especially the second half. And it really focuses on grammar. There is surprisingly little about Iran or Persian culture, there is no color anywhere (and uninteresting layout in general), the images used are terrible (couldn't they afford actual pictures?), and there are mistakes in every chapter, although they're generally pretty small and easy to see. On the other hand, there isn't exactly much competition.Vocabulary is also an issue - sometimes they give you tons of vocab to help with the readings and exercises, other times barely any. And short vowel markings are inconsistent, which is a little confusing for the beginner.Overall, it's an okay book, but could be a lot better."
1,Too much information in this issue which makes it easier to create myths,"Everyday you come across with a new information about this issue written by anyone. When there are too much information that is always used by some people who creates new myths about blaming one side, this book is one of them. Waste of money"
4,Awesome sweatshirt for a patriot fan,Sweat shirt runs true to size and the picture on it is absolutely great. No defects what so ever with great detail. Also very warm!!
5,"wow, what an indepth book!!","I love this book. I met Bruce twice. hes very insightful and knows what hes talking about. Fabulous book, if you want a real deep education in the later 60's beatles albums and conflicts. Once, i thaught i would sit and read it for 5 minutes and i was so caught up in the book, an hour had passed by, didn't even know it. great book. get this!!!"
1,Junk,Have had this for less than a month. Have followed the instructions carefully-hand wash and dry it. It leaks around the lid and the decorative black rubber like bands on the outside keep falling off. Do not recommend this at all unless you want to take a bath in coffee every day.
4,nice mugs but,These are well designed mugs. The handle allows for holding in your hand without grasping the mug. Only minus is it is stainless only on the outside. Where the liquid is stored is black plastic. I promptly dropped it off the hood of my Jeep a distance of about 4 feet. I put a dent in the bottom edge but it still functions perfectly.
2,Pain & Passion : A Psychoanalyst Explores the World of S & M,"I was hoping this book would be a little more about the Psychoanalytical theories involved in BDSM but instead this book is simple a series of interviews. Some of the interviews are interesting tibbits into small section of the BDSM world, mainly the working aspect of BDSM. I am not impressed by the selection of people who he choose to interview, and frankly don't think it reflects the life style. It does provide some insight into the life Domme who does it as a job, which manages to redeem it into having some value. Unless you are researching BDSM you really don't have a need to buy this book."
5,Anthropological/ psychoanalytic dig into San Francisco B&D scene,"You don't have to go to New Guinea to find perceptive insights into exotic behavior that heretofore had only been described by Freudian armchair theorists who hadn't troubled to do the field research. Fascinating, dedicated research into a field that illuminates what many of us express in our sexual fantasies (when too reserved or too considerate to actually act on them) if only in an attenuated form."
3,SADOMASOCHISTIC SEX-SCRIPTS,"Robert J. StollerPain and Passion:A Psychoanalyst Explores the World of S & M(New York: Plenum, 1991) 306 pagesAn account of the life and work of""bondage and discipline"" clubs in California,based on interviews with owners and workers.Interesting raw data for further thinking and researchinto sadomasochistic sex-scripts.Why do some people derive sexual pleasure from pain(or pretenses of pain) and humiliation?If you are interested in discovering other unusual sexual fantasies,search the Internet for the following bibliography:""SEXOLOGY---SEX-SCRIPTS---BEST BOOKS"".James Leonard Park, author ofImprinted Sexual Fantasies:A New Key for Sexology."
3,Very Difficult,"I bought this puzzle for my child, age 5, who loves everything dino. I ended up putting this puzzle together mostly myself. i even had a time struggling because the pieces don't interlock. Definitely more for someone with more patience than a child and some adults."
2,Shift knob,"The shift knob looks very nice and was color coded to my needs. However, the insert adaptors do not work with my threaded male shifter. The plastic inserts are not threaded so the shift knob just falls off almost immediately. No clear instructions are provided to address my issue. Very dissapointed with the outcome.No numbers to call for help either.Wasted my money."
1,Poor audio quality,I own three CDs by MEDITATIONS FOR LIFE and their audio quality is very poor. The music is so loud you cannot hear the narration.
5,Great Classic,"I always played this game when i got done with my homework in middle school, nowadays i get off work and play it still, 8 years later!"
5,"The Work and the Glory, Pillar of Light","This book, The Work and the Glory, Pillar of Light makes history come alive. Very readable and holds your attention throughout."
3,Funny...and not.,"I got a real kick out of reading this book--it's humorous and I would hope that people take it at that. It's not a philosophical romp or anything of the like--it's just funny.What ISN'T funny is that it demonstrates a sad state of affairs in business culture today and of yesteryear. Knowing there are managers out there that do practice these principles is somewhat disturbing; you don't have to be a jerk to get ahead.If anything, this book tells you how to look out for these people--it's up to you to beat them at their own game."
4,"Yeah, Right","A wonderful broadside against Western Civilization as we know it today. Is it essential to your corporate survival to be completely demented at the outset of your career, or do you only become more and more demented the higher you rise in your organization? Clearly Stanley Bing, tongue in cheek, is praying to the gods for some rescuse from our current corporate structures(s. Do NOT do what he recommends in this book. Instead, have a good a laugh at all of human kind. And let's all of us figure out some alternatives to this madness."
1,Instead subscribe to Fortune and get more Bing for your buck,"Somewhat amusing book, but could have made the same point in a column. Repetitious and definitely not worth the cost of a hardcover."
2,An Amusing Read,I would to agree with one of the negative reviews that Mr. Bing may not have fully understood Machiavelli. He may have read him thoroughly but he doesn't really seem to get what his aim was. Enemies in the days of the Medici were real and the lust for power was not guided by lawful means. You even had to watch your drink. Machiavelli was writing in those days where ruthlessness ensured survival for Il Principe.Its nonetheless an amusing book. I have a boss who happens to be a nice guy so its better to share him the book than throw it at him. I do recognize though that narcissistic individuals are bloodthirsty and ruthless. I meet these people but luckily they are not in positions of power.It has its moments. A good single pass would do.
1,I doubt Mr. Bing has even read The Prince...,"I bought this book based on the reviews on Amazon and am incredibly disappointed. I figured the book wasn't going to be philosophical or even very serious, but I did think it would insightful and interesting. It was neither. The ""chapters"" are very poorly written and have virtually no point to them. There are no developed examples and no shred of reference to anything in The Prince, other than being mean.My copy has been relegated to the bathroom, right next to the Far Sides (which are not only more interesting, but more insightful...)I could not not recommend this book more. The best thing about it is that it only takes 1 hour to read."
5,Hand book for the corporate ladder climber,"This book takes the essesnce of ""The Prince"" and breaks it down into easy to understand lessons, complete with everyday examples. The orginal work is anticdotes of Italian princes, this book uses people like Donald Trump, Madonna...etc. People who know how to get what they want. If you are tired of WWJD (What Would Jesus Do?) get this book for a refreshing perspective on how to manage your every day life."
3,What Would Machiaevelli Do?,A provincial satire. Examples taken primaririly from the New York City world of publishing to give us their machiavelliesque approach to modern day personnel management. IMUS missed the boat on this one and I will definitely keep that in mind when he recommends another book done over-the- weekend by one of his New York cronies.
3,Buy this book to beware !,"Confession - I'm a fan of Bing's column in Fortune.Bing brings his style of humour to bear on all those behaviours which we've heard or seen megalomaniacs use, but hope we never get to experience them first hand, and of course we would never dream of applying them ourselves.So, this isn't a book to use to learn new torture techniques, but to learn to identify those traits in others and be aware (or should that be 'beware'?).Of the 45 or so Chapters, here is a selection of my favourites, giving excellent personal examples, naming names :Responding to the question ""What would Machiavelli do? He would ......""- be a paranoid freak- always be at war- fire his own mother- respond poorly to criticism- have no conscience to speak of- scream at people a lot- establish and maintain a psychotic level of controland lastly- not be a jerkRead the book to find the famous names who fit these profiles!"
1,I'm sure Machiavelli would do better,"The problem with this book is not its meanness, it's its brainlesness. This very low end and unimaginative approach to business success is a loser. Perhaps Mr. Bing's busniess experience dates him. Ruthlessness aside, today you have to be smarter and faster than the competition, not cruder, to make it. What Would Machiavelli Do would get Mr. Bing fired in today's market."
3,Interesting angle for the working masses,"Bing takes a pretty severe perspective on what it takes to succeed in this world, and couches it with humor and amusing anecdotes. It's a quick read that's perfect for the subway. Thank god he made it funny or I would have killed myself in order to save myself from a world filled with such ruthlessness and lack of integrity. Judge for yourself, but for me, I am going to keep using a Pollyanna approach to success just to prove him wrong. Wish me luck Mr. Bing and God help Machiavellians on Judgement Day!"
4,funny,"I laughed, hard. And gave the book to my very good friend who always had lots of bloodsuckers around him. Believe it or not but he learned a lesson and quickly weeded out the ones that did not offer anything in exchange. I don't think this was the intent of the book but it made me (and evidently the friend of mine) to think about things in a new context. Thanks Mr. Bing! Another great one from you."
4,"Good info. to face real world, not to emulate it...","I agree with all who wrote that this book is a satire (sadistic if you will). I see this book as a reality check of corporate behavior that we all have to be cautios about. I higly recommend readign this book to be better prepared for the real world, but not to emulate and/or adopt the author's opinion."
1,Over rated and boring!,"I am told that Bing is a very humorous author. He tried too hard here, had nothing to say but tried anyway, and it shows. Very boring and not a bit funny."
1,A horrible little book,"What a horrible, distasteful little book Mr. Bing has written. Machiavellian politics and strategies are fascinating and important, but Bing's approach has resulted in a grubby little book that leaves a nasty aftertaste. I tossed my new copy in the trash the same day it arrived. The first time I have ever done that with any book. There are far better offerings out there. You will regret buying this one."
1,Badly Written.,"Stanley Bing seems to be successful businessman giving hard-nosed, realistic advise about the business world, but one thing he is not is a writer. In fact, the writing is quite poor in this book and would be an insult to anyone with a high school reading level. On top of that, Mr. Bing quotes mass murders like Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin to ""prove"" his point even more.Mr. Bing feels any kind of morals or ethics need to be thrown away for the sake of making money and being successful. Yes, that has happened in the past, but look what happened to those people. They either ended up in jail or died. But if you ask Mr. Bing, that still doesn't matter because they made lots of money!!Mr. Bing, since you are such a tough guy, let me ask you a question. Have you fought in any wars?"
5,helps cat with hip dysplasia,"My 18-pound cat (not fat, she's just a big kitty) was crippled and almost unable to walk due to hip dysplasia. She is only five years old, so I didn't want to give up on her. The vet prescribed Cosequin, and within a few weeks she was doing a lot better. She is still gimpy and cannot 'levitate' like a healthy cat, but she can jump up on fences and windowsills, and does all right. This stuff works."
5,Nutramax Coseguin for small animals,"Nutramax Coseguin is a God sent for my Havanese dog that is 12 years old. She has problems with Arthritis and with this she can go for walks, even dances for treats. I do notice that I can't cut her down to 1/2 tab. Sheloves the tastes so it's easy to administer. A small price to pay to haveyour furkids happy."
3,Some side effects for my cat,"This product may be the very best there is or not; I'm unable to tell as my poor senior pussycat seemed to have an awful problem with side effects; she ended up vomiting and had quite bad diarrhea (not fun for me either). I did read that not all cats will have such a reaction. To be fair, this cat is my ""high maintenance/problem child"" feline, and there are a few other issues she has which may have contributed to this (She is 9 years old now, has a problem with her anal glands plugging up, she's a tad overweight and she tends to gobble her food quickly and ask for more) Out other cat is about the lowest maintenance moggie you could hope for; never a problem with him. He's as happy and healthy as can be, the friendliest cat you could hope for.Still, I'm going to try it again. She's fine now and the vet didn't seem too concerned and suggested we try varying the amount we give her, so she doesn't take it all in one hit.I will report back with any further developments!"
5,Cosequin,"Information given was complete. I would have liked an immediate confirmation/email to be sure that my order went through. It was the manufacturer, brand, strength and count that I was looking for. I am very happy and feel that I got a good price."
3,Cosequin.,My 8 year old maltese does not have a problem eating her kibble with the Cosequin sprinkled on her food which was an initial concern. She has only been on Cosequin for a couple of weeks which I understand is not sufficient time to notice any benefits.
1,Poor Customer Service,I ordered a bottle of cosequin for my cat from Absolutely Pets. What I received was a bottle of cosequin for Senior Dogs. When I tried to request information on returning the item (twice) I never heard back from the Company. I am now out $40 and will never purchase from this seller again.
5,Saw big changes in the pup,Three years ago I rescued two mill breeder Yorkies. They were both in bad shape. Both had trouble walking being locked in stacked cages for years. And even though in time they learned to love the leash and their walks I still saw that they limped on many occasions. Cosequin was recommended and after using it for over a month I saw a vast difference in one of them. She now runs and leaps over small obstacles with the greatest of ease. I believe the Cosequin was responsible for that. My other little one doesn't seem to tolerate it very well. But to be fair she has chronic gastric upsets and this product like many other things seems to upset her stomach. But I am thrilled that it has worked for at least one of them. If you have small dogs one bottle will last a year as I sprinkle half a capsule once a day on her food.
3,mixed review,Did nice things for my cat's joints but gave her intolerable diarhea. (not sending video...)
5,Heart-Burn,I remember this product from when I was a kid. When all the regular products for heart burn were ineffective I remembered Brioschi. I couldn't find it anywhere and thought they went out of business. Convinced that a product as good as Brioschi could not go out of business I checked Amazon and found it. I remember my father swearing about it's effectiveness and now I can add mine.
5,This is fabulous,"My kids, ages 8 and 4, just love this CD. We listen to it, over and over again, in the car. The 8 year old has memorized a lot of it. It's better than DVDs in the car -- they love the storytelling (and they don't get nauseous because they're looking too closely at something!). HIGHLY recommended."
1,Rip Off!,You can buy these cars in the store for about $3.50. Why does Amazon allow these jacked up prices?
1,20 bucks for a car!?! You Have got to be kidding me.,"If you are going to rape the consumer, go to Ebay. These cars sell for 3.29 at toys r us and target. 20 bucks is a rip off and this company should be removed from Amazon."
2,Great when it works,"One day, about a month, after I bought the camera and dock, it just quit. Even after spending literally hours with the really nice tech people at Kodak who ""fixed"" it, it just quit working properly again. My computer sporatically refuses to recognize the dock or the camera. Needless to say that makes it worthless for me. Now it may be the computers fault - how is one to know - but you ask me how I rate this product. I have had digital cameras before and not this problem."
2,Not recommended,"When I first got my Kodak digi cam I loved it! I recommended it to everyone! But now after using it for only a year, when I take it off the docking station, I am able to take only one shot before the camera battery dies. I have purchased a new battery which worked great after the first charging, and then I experienced the same behavior with the battery again. My Dad has the same model with the same problem.I read in someone else's review that the camera battery will work longer if it's not left in the docking station. If that is the case, then what is the purpose of the docking station? I do not recommend wasting your money on this camera. Especially when the picture quality is not what you would expect from a company such as Kodak."
3,Good but went Nuts,Casio is a great brand but I don't know what happened with this watch. It was fine but after about 14 months it went crazy on me. I was on vacation when the numbers went blank and the light turned on and remained on. I could not get it back to normal so I had to let it die. I got a G-Shock for xmas to replace it and I guess one day I'll buy another battery to see if it can work again.
3,Not an IR remote!,This remote is tied to the switch unit by cable so you can be remote as 6ft ONLY. The IR model is not in the Amazon catalog. I don't why they don't offer both...cost is about the same on GEFEN website...though hard to find. Tangles up more desk space actually.
5,This is NOT a comic . . .,"I'm writing in response to the previous reviewer, who complained that a lot of dialogue, etc. had been cut from the film in order to fit the story into comic form. Unfortunately, he or she has obviously reviewed the wrong item, as this version of Mask of the Phantasm is a full-fledged paperback novel, NOT a comic or illustrated book! It contains lots of the original movie dialogue--plus a whole lot more, including some clever explanations left out of the film. (Can you tell that I loved it?) The author also adapted several of the batman animated TV shows (Shadows of the Past, Dual to the Death, The Dragon and the Bat). Wish they'd do more of these."
2,Super Reader,"A junior version of the Batman - The Animated Series movie novelisation, there is an adult or young adult, or whichever by Geary Gravel, as well. An old girlfriend of Batman's is more than she seems.She even manages to hold her own with the Joker, and realises she doesn't see things the way Bruce does.Alfred also whips out a good one :Batman turned: ""You think you know everything about me, don't you?""Alfred crossed his arms on his chest. ""I diapered your bottom,"" he grumbled. ""I bloody well ought to, Sir."""
3,From Back Cover,"All across Gotham City, mobsters are dying - murdered. At the scene of each killing, witnesses see a mysterious masked figure in a long dark cloak. The word spreads though the city like wildfire... Batman has crossed the line, become a criminal in the name of fighting crime. And suddenly the Dark Knight is hunted by the very lawmen he once risked his life to asisit.While Batman searches for the masked murderer of Gotham's crime lords, an old flame unexpectedlyreenters his life. She is the first woman Bruce Wayne ever loved - and the only person who could make him consider giving up his life as a crime fighter. Now, as the mysterious figure dubbed the Phantasm spreads terror throughout Gotham City, Batman must decide whether his rediscovered love is worth fighting for - even if it means hanging up his cape and cowl for good."
4,Good,I had no problem with this turntable. It did what it was supposed to do and it did it efficiently. For the price...I say go for it!
3,Numark Turntable,This product does serve the need for my intention to convert my vinyls into MP3.It does work very well.There are a few minor flaws:(1) It does not come with a hard/soft dust cover.(2)I swapped the pick-up cartridge with my old Shure M3D but to find out that it's too heavy for the balancing weight piece even when I pushed it all the way back.(3) The unit is lacking the lever to lower the tone arm and it doesn't come with speed indicator or markers on side of the turning drum in order to make use of the speed adjuster.
4,I have missed my music!,"The techies out there might not be impressed, but I am SO happy to hear my albums again. I love hearing my old friends, and singing all the words. I love that I don't have to buy them again.It took no time at all to load up the software, tho I'll be spending some time learning to use some of the extra features. I'm looking forward to a version that will recognize song breaks.The machine is simple to use and hook up. I do wish it had a hard dust cover. I believe that the arm will be damaged as I take it out & put it away."
1,not pro gear & works poorly with Mac,"There are some major problems with this turntable. Needle quality is poor, creates a very brittle sound. No tone arm. clip on tone arm rest is very cheap plastic, drops closed without you closing it, so occasionally when you pick up the needle to take it off the record and rest it on the arm rest, the clip is closed and knocks the tone arm out of your finger's grasp, sending it skittering across your pristine vinyl, scratching all the way. worst of all, the software is not engineered for a mac, and after following the directions closely I never got it to work. I'm fairly good technically, though no techie, but I have worked with pro tools for years and know how to follow directions. Plus, there is a hum, and no grounding wire. you don't want a hum even if you can get it to work."
4,tobetrue,"very nice for the price.all it needs is a tonearm lift( some hands are not steady enough)i have the belt drive,but the direct drive may be a better product."
4,Numark Turntable,"Easy to set up and software user friendly. However, I object to being forced to use iTunes. Doesn't seem to do wab files eaisly, if at all. Would love if it did 78's. Quality is good."
1,exercise in frustration,"I read several reviews on this product that stated that out of the box there was little difficulty in setting it up and getting usable music files.Well, two computer setups, downloading extra software, attempting to gain support from numark and it's customer blog proved futile in my search for success.The customer support from Numark is only available during normal business hours when I'm working.So I am returning my ttusb to the hole of frustration it emerged from. I eagerly await an easy way to accomplish the task of translating my vinyl to cd.I'm disgusted and very dissappointed as I had high hopes for translating my mounds of vinyl to a new format."
2,Turntable is inconsistent in speed.,The turntable failed to generate and maintain speed after less that 5 hours of operation. Probably have to return or throw away.
4,Convert LPs to mp3 files!,"Assembly instructions for the turntable were not clear and setting up Audacity software to function properly on my Mac took some time, but overall once set up was completed, the Numark TTUSB Turntable does exactly what it should. The Audacity software was tricky to learn, but the instruction booklet that comes with the turntable is very helpful. Overall a great product, durable construction and excellent recording results."
1,Worthless software and matching customer support.,"Supposedly comes with software that integrates with iTunes and includes Gracenote Music ID so that you don't have to manually enter every single song name. The iTunes ""import"" is a simple dump into the library and Gracenote has been dropped without a single mention on the Numark or Ion website. Customer service (after 10 plus minutes on hold) says, ""we dropped Music ID a long time ago.""Consider an alternative product / company."
4,Numark turntable,Everything is working smoothly. But nothing is as easy as the advertisements indicate. After downloading programs and looking up info I have successfully put many of my vinyl LPs unto my Ipod. The turntable is fine. It could use a cover and a tonearm raiser and lowerer.
4,"Great turntable, a few feature requests","I love my Numark turntable. Great quality sound. I will say I was disappointed that there is no auto return, and the counterweight is not simple to configure.....other than that basically plug and play and I really am pleased with my purchase."
5,Very good product,"Thankfully I ignored a lot of the other review complaints. In my case every one of them turned out to be ""didnt read the manual"" or ""didnt follow the instructions"". It is an excellent product for its intended purpose which is to plug into your computer and burn vinyls direct to CD. Extremely simple to set up, 20 minutes for me, just follow the instructions provided which were unusually clear. It also does have very good fidelity, it does not compete with $3000+ turntables but does a good job considering its price catagory. The software supplied also similarly was very simple to set up as long as one takes the time to read the instructions. I absolutely would recommend this product to anyone."
4,LPs to CDs in just over playing time!,"This product truly ""liberates the music from its vinyl prison of decades"" as the New York TImes review stated.The instructions for saving to Mac WAV files in the attached Audacity guide is convoluted. Better call level 2 tech support at 401-658-3131 and they'll give much simpler and clearer instructions."
4,USB Turntable,Nice Turntable offers all the features of most turntables.Works seemlessly on MAC. Don't know how stable it would be on Windows - kind of afraid to try.
4,So far so good,"I have had the product for a month and no problems so far. The assembly instructions are a bit of a pain. Assembling the arm is easy enough, but getting it balanced takes some effort - about 10 minutes. The rest assembles in minutes and can be done by a five year old. Great to listen to my old albums again!"
4,USB Turntable,"I purchased this USB Turntable for my sister, who has many, many, many 'albums' to copy.She states it works fine."
1,Numark...................used to be Ion,I had purchased this product before when it was know as IonIt was most unsatisfactory..........Then and nowSoftware did not do what it was supposed to do and seemed to upset my computer
4,It is a good experience,"Yes, this is a good product. The output connections are (phono level,line level and usb) very use full.The included software is EZ vinyl converter.I think the Audacity is the best one for this equipment.2 minus points are , no 45rpm adaptor holder and the output connections panel is under the turntable.other wise it is so good.I suggest the dust cover must include with this TTUSB."
4,"Great Products, ION is the same unit but cheaper!","The Ion and Numark products are virtually identical ecxept for some color differences in components...SAME components, just different color. They have to be the exact same except for surface cosmetics. I bought the ION from Urban Outfitters and LOVE IT!!!!"
1,Unnacceptable,"As excited as I was to get a USB turntable, to digitize my 500 some odd pieces of vinyl, when the ION was unavailable, I turned to Numark. Within the first few recordings, I was able to discern a noticable and completely unacceptable wobbling of the pitch of the recorded items. In the ONLY response I got from Numark, the representative tried to blame it on my improperly assembling the belt mechanism, which could, in no way, affect the frequency of the audible wobble, occurring at the frequency of the platter rotation. It was quite apparent that the platter was improperly molded. Upon reviewing the pictures of the ION turntable, it also became apparent that the Numark is a cheap off-shore knock-off of the ION, with little or no quality control.Be prepared to throw it in the trash, as it won't even move for a dollar at a garage sale."
1,Rubbish,"A faulty turntable, NO international warranty, NO support, and terrible customer service. Enough said."
1,Numark TTUSB Turntable with USB,I get half. item arrived without the band (Turntable Belt- TT1600 Series and TTUSB) . In his spare page is not soldThank you.
1,No evaluation,Unfortunately I can't review the product because I received the package without the counterweight and because of this I can't use the turntable.
4,Satisfied User,"Free shipping and it arrived the next day-- unbelievable. Getting it ready to record was a breeze and the recording quality, to these unsophisticated ears, was very good. It will adequately fill the purpose of transferring our extensive vinyl collection to CDs over the coming months."
4,Very good for the cost.,"This product works very well. The only issue I have is that you have to remember to lift the arm when the record is over. It does not have an auto lift, so you can't walk away from it for very long without risking needle damage. Also, the signal is very low and a preamp is needed. If you don't already have one, don't buy this product without buying something to power the signal. Otherwise, I am very happy with this investment."

2,Too difficult to open clasp,"I've had clasp closures on watches and bracelets before, but never any which were as difficult to open as this one. It took multiple attempts to get this watch off my wrist, and I broke a fingernail trying to pry up the clasp one evening. If I had purchased it for only occasional use I might have been willing to live with the problem, but I needed it for everyday use and don't want to go through the frustrating experience every evening before I go to bed. I'm returning it. It is a very pretty watch, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. Too bad the clasp is such a problem."
5,Great watch..,Got this watch for my mother in law.. and she loved it.. Great watch for the price and highly recommended..
4,"Narrow band, narrow face, gold and silver: Almost perfect!","I've been wearing this watch for about two years. I love it. The only fault I find with it is that the crystal is already very badly scratched. In my mind, I think the crystal should have resisted scratches better. The metal links comprising the band are still in very good shape, MUCH better than the crystal.What I love about this watch:I wear it everywhere and it goes with all types of jewelry.This watch is very comfortable to wear: It is not heavy, and the face and band feel like ""one"". The band has a very pliable feel to it.I can move my wrist in all directions and the size and shape of the face do not interfere with my movement. I don't feel the watch on my wrist, now that I'm thinking about it. I'm real picky about that....Even though the crystal scratches, I could easily buy this watch again."
3,Seiko Watch,"This was a present so I can,t comment on the product. Since I did not get a complaint about the present,it must be OK!"
4,Love the watch but the clasp broke already,I bought this watch because of the silver and gold color. I like to mix metals and often wear all gold or all silver or both and this watch fits the bill. Unfortunately the pin in the clasp fell out and it fell off. I haven't gotten it fixed yet but I do love the watch itself and look forward to wearing it again.
2,"For Olive Skin, Not Brown","I bought this based on a rec from a youtube user ad after consulting the Joe Blasco website in an effort to cover dark circles. This is too light. This may work on olive tones at best but not on skin darker than that. You may also want an emollient with it, it's pretty dry on its own though others have given it good reviews on MUA."
4,Elegant Indian Fare,"Usually cookbooks that are photographed so beautifully have recipes that are impossible to follow or replicate. This is not the case in Raji Cuisine. Most Indian cooking is quite labor intensive, requiring numerous steps. Most of Jallepalli's recipes were quite easy. The real test came when I prepared a 4 course meal using the recipes in the book. My guest were quite pleased, and loved the variety in flavors that usually don't detect in average Indian fare. Since it is sometimes difficult to decide what wine should go with intensely spiced food, I appreciated the wine suggestions for each of the main courses."
2,Beware: This is not flavorful Indian food!,"I thought this would be the best cookbook ever - Indian spices with elegant French fare. Well, I've made three things from this book and all were pretty bland. If you already have basic cooking skills, you'd be better served by buying an Indian cookbook and applying that philosophy to cooking to meats and vegetables."
3,Not what I had hoped for.,"I cook often and adore Indian food. These recipes are a bit labor intensive as they often require oils and other elements that you must make before beginning the recipes. And the results are good but lack that Indian 'spice' (not heat - but intensity, rather) that I had hoped for. So I will continue to play are with Madhur Jaffrey's authentic (and delicious) recipes, incorporating French elements on my own. I have had better results that way."
1,Not as Expected,The poolside volley ball net did not stretch the lenght of a standard pool. I ended up needing to purchase additional string to make it work and then at that it easily tipped over at the post. I purchased this for a 13 year old birthday party hoping it would be a good source of entertainment and was severely disappointed.
5,Works Great!,"I have to admit, I am impressed. We purchased this volleyball set last summer and have used it constantly since. The product is easy to setup/takedown and tons of fun.I have a 18' wide inground and the net easily covers this distance. The net itself is probably ~16' wide, so it spans almost the entire distance across our pool and the strings are easily another 4-6' longer on each side, so it should fit a 24' wide pool as advertised.I think it took me about ten minutes to setup the supports and net. We fill the bases with water and they are remarkably stable - I don't think the net bases/supports have been pulled into the water yet.The ball provided is actually very durable and hasn't needed to be inflated.One other note...at the time of this review, Amazon provides two photos of the set. You might notice that the two photos show different bases. Our set matches the bases shown in the photo of the box."
1,Poor volleyball set twice!,"We ordered another set that was pictured. After two tries to replace the product, company on the way and Amazons promise to satisfy, I give this poorly made, have to live with it volleyball set I did not order and was never corrected a poor product review. Do not order if youbwant a quality volleyball set. Again I am stuck with a poor Amazon deal."
3,"Interesting stories, but not enough to recommend.","Akutagawa's collection of six stories here is quite interesting. ""In a Grove"" is the best one, of course and it inspired the Kurosawa film ""Rashomon"". In that, we see people lying, and we see false ""confessions"", and we have no idea what the truth really was. That was almost enough to recommend, but the others don't rise up enough. ""Yam Gruel"" is about the tragedy of getting what you want. ""The Martyr"" is a story of a person falsely accused of a shocking deed, but gives up their own life to save their accuser. The others have been mentioned and aren't as good as the three I mentioned"
5,Very good book of Chung Ling Soo's life!,"This numbered, limited edition, authored by Gary R. Frank, has been fully approved by Hector Robinson son of William E. Robinson. Each book has a bookplate signed by Hector Robinson. It is a short (52pages) but exhausting bibliography on Chung Ling Soo. This is one of the books in the bibliography of the new Jim Steinmeyer's book."
4,A Peaceful river,"Jocelyn's freely flowing piano music carries one down the river of tranquility, relaxing mind, body and spirit. Her dynamics are powerful as she seems to flow smoothly through pleasing moods. It is somewhat akin to the piano music on the CD New England Sunrise."
3,Good film,I liked this film but I didn't love it. I believe they tried to give their characters substance but ran short. I would rent it instead of buying. Good for a lazy rainy night at home.
4,Interesting movie....not so great ending,"Well acted movie, with an interesting plot; falling in love with another person-regardless of gender and all the fall-out. There were many memorable scenes (especially the bathroom scene) and in my opinion all the actors did a good job. Although the ending fit with the story (of preplanned storybook life versus the not-so-tidy reality of falling in love)....it was too open-ended."
1,omg....snore-fest!!,all i can say is.....boring!!!!! i was hoping for some guy on guy stuff or some kind of plotline... but all i wanted to do was fast forward
3,The Foursome...,"What I liked about this flick--- it was NOT the standard ... she goes back to her boyfriend -- after her ""college "" experience movie !!!Claps hands!I also give Amazon a pat on the back for having a diverse film library!"
5,Simple movie but Epic!!,This movie should of gotten more reviews and i wish it would of made it more out there. I love the Humor the movie brings and i love the two main characters. Very cute movie.. I wish it had a better ending though..
1,a decent attempt,"main character not convincing/usually unflattering in her upkeep, poorly constructed, a decent attempt but this story has been done a hundred times. i was looking forward to it but was pretty let down"
1,A film that doesn't take off,"This film was a huge disappointment! Me and my wife watch it for 15 minutes, and then turned to each other saying: This is just boring! Not bad, not silly, no nothing. Just not interesting at all.I think that the problem with this film is that it is not written very well. The script is very thin and feels as if it is just in its cradle.Sometimes I have patience with boring films. But when a pedant girl with a boyfriend meets a free spirited queer girl, it seems too obvious what is going to happen. Seen it before but better!I you wanna see ""girl with boyfriend meets girl"" watch Puccini for Beginners or Elena Undone! They're splendid!"
1,Not a good representation of LGBT NY,"This film is not a good representative of LGBT New York. NYC is very diverse. This film is not. I would have liked this film a lot better if I felt it was realistic. New York is nearly 70% ethnic, of very diverse backgrounds. This film is not diverse at all. Even the extras are not ethnic. It's too bad that filmmakers don't pay attention to their demographics, or choose to deny the reality. Part of the experience from film is to feel it's realistic and this one failed miserably."
2,The one draw back of this game,"the games on this are typical domino's and play well.The major draw back is the tile shuffling ability I have found there are only 2 different shuffle arrangements and I am beginning to memorize them I am regularly getting lower scores because of this In a short while the game will lose its appeal.minor issues are i wish it could keep scores and names ,to get a sharp contrast on the screen it has to be held just right. It has a narrow field of view."
2,not for serious dominoe players,"i hate to give less than a good review; but, this dominoe game is not what i expected. even though the screen is small it scrolls in every direction so you can see parts of the board you need to. after the initial double is played cross ways all others are laid like normal dominoes, i didnt like this at all. i also noticed that when i turn the game off come back and play another game, i draw the same exact dominoes again! i was actually looking for a dominoe game that would let me play all fives. this game is for beginners not serious players or those who want to improve their game."
3,Reverse Snobbery,"In paragraph after paragraph, Deutschman lauds the people of Sonoma, whom he sees as ""reg'lar folks,"" while excoriating people from Napa, most San Franciscans, and anybody who stops at a winery for wine tasting. This is reverse snobbery at its worst. I quickly tired of Deutschman's pronouncements of who's a phony, and who's pretentious. Napa and Sonoma have plenty to offer, Alan. Leave your sophomoric value judgements out of it, especially when you revel in being a guest at a rich out-of-towner's weekend retreat in Sonoma."
5,amusing look behind the scenes,"Janet Maslin's review in the New York Times called this book enjoyably wry and amusing and compared it to a young Tom Wolfe, and she's got a point. The book is light and entertaining, a compelling fast read filled with colorful characters. There's the man who spends $500,000 on a single bottle of wine, and the vintner with a barnful of vintage Porsches, Ferraris, and Bentleys on his Napa ""farm,"" and the community activists who fight so that dozens of chickens can wander freely through the town square in Sonoma. The book gives an eye-opening insider's look at the wine country and shows what visitors rarely see when they come for a day of wine tasting or a weekend getaway at an inn or resort. The tone is humorous and bemused but the book also raises real issues about growth and development and direct democracy and how can we try to preserve the natural beauty and character of a place as more people flock to live there and threaten to ruin it."
1,Bad read,Probably the lamest book about the area I have read. I only finished out of determination to find out if there was any reason for anybody to ready it. The conclusion was no.
1,Melrose Place meets the Wine Country,Deutschman has attempted to make Sonoma and Napa Valleys a tale similar to the television series Melrose Place. This is a poorly written silly waiste of time.
2,Feels like a run-on magazine article,"Echoing what others have written, this is an extremely light account of the Sonoma and Napa wine regions. Unclear plot line (is there one?) and very little depth on any of the subjects that could have made it interesting (how about at least letting us know how the Screaming Eagle tasted?). If you are looking for a short, light hearted read with some reasonably interesting tidbits on Sonoma and Napa, this is an ok read. If you're looking for an ejoyable read with depth and history, this isn't it - your time would be much better spent reading House of Mondavi."
4,Pretty Cool but wish they weren't white..,Quality seems good but there was a little fraying where the logo was attached. I wish they weren't white because I almost do not want to use them. I wish they were blue instead so they don't stain. The set is pretty cute and was a great price.
3,Good book -- but mistakes are annoying.,"I found this book to be an easy read, and well setup; however, there were many typographical errors that I can't believe made it into print. Question section has many errors were MS Word must have went crazy in its auto numbering. Furthermore, the software has alot of errors including figures and illustrations that are mismatched with the questions; grammatical errors; and there software apparently doesn't handle the apostrophe character. While these may seem like minor errors, it is a representation of the author's and publisher's professionalism."
4,Good Watch for the Price.,"I needed to replace a Casio G-Shock that rarely received an update from NIST, needed to see sunlight often to hold a charge and finally started leaking when I swam. I wanted an inexpensive, waterproof watch with its own replaceable battery. This fit the bill and I am satisfied so far. The wrist band is a little chintzy but I can live with that."
3,Who needs a second hand.....,"I love this watch. Lite, accurate, flexible for whatever I am wearing. But at 6 months the second had disconnected and proceed to bounce all over inside the watch and on occasion jam the hour and minute hands and bring them to a stop.The good news is that the digital display continued to work just fine.At this price, I will order another and hope the second hand stays attached."
4,Good watch with all the basics I need,"Good watch with all the basics I need. I do wish it had numbers instead of just hash marks, but the digital display gives me a varification incase I guess wrong. Comfortable to wear and handsome (in my opinion) and it isn't as huge as many sports watches that seem so bulky on your arm. 4/5 stars from me."
5,Positive opinion,"When I ordered this watch I did it because I saw this watch has features I need and maybe more than that. I was right.First of all, I like dual time watch because I like to know exact time in other time zone.Moreover, I don't want to ask someone for exact date. I want to have it on my watch. This watch also has useful feature - lap memory which helps me when I run arround socer field because I often forget how many laps I made. And, one unexpected but very good feature is auto illumitator which helps me to see the time when my both hands are busy.It is also water resistant which means a lot when I swim.In short this watch is perfect for my needs and it is also very cheap."
5,Ricardo,"It is a complete product, I have bought and satisfied it, take it everywhere.Es un producto completo, lo he comprado y estoy satisfecho, lo llevo a todas partes"
5,Casio WS300-1EV Men's Full LCD Ana-Digi Illuminator Sport Watch,"Good Day! I need to know that I happen with the sending of the clock, already for enough time I execute the purchase and up to today I have not had response of the company that transports the articles."
3,Just a shelf,"This is just a rackmount shelf. If you dont' have a rackmount shelf handy this isn't a terrible price, but if you've got one sitting around don't waste your money. My number 1 complaint is that this is designed to mount half rack units but it doesn't include a blank for the unused bay. You can center mount your device, but this just leaves open spaces on either side. Not exactly a glamorous solution.Includes bolt holes to secure your device, but of course you could make your own with a drill and two minutes.Rackmount is painted silver so it matches your Gefen device but won't match anything else in your rack."
4,Great follow on book!,"The Dead Girls Dance picks up right where Glass Houses finished. The second book in the Morganville Vampires sequence is an amazing thrill ride from the first word to the last.Held captive in their home by Shane's terrifying father Claire and Eve fight to protect themselves. Yet just when they gain their freedom, their relief is only temporary, as a vampire turns up dead and Shane is held responsible.Claire has become a lot stronger in this book and like where her character is going. She isn't so nave, although she still makes silly mistakes like any teenager does.The Dead Girls' Dance is a gripping novel laced with humour, action, romance and scary vampires. This was a great book and I truly hope that the series continues the same."
4,Book review,I am just getting started on the second book. Moves alot faster than the first. I am enjoying it and will probably order number 3.
5,Fantastic Book,"For those who love a great, fast paced, funny vampire books with engaging characters, read this book. It's even a great read for those who are no longer teenagers. The author obviously cares about the characters which means a lot to many of us who learn the characters and love to see them in book after book. I would encourage everyone to read this one."
4,a fun and easy read!,I purchased the first 6 books in this series (the 7th due soon!)They were a fun and easy read.I enjoyed them and will probably purchase the next one when it comes out.Highly recommended for teenagers.
2,Perils of Pauline,What was the point of having a teenage girl who does nothing but get rescued be the protagonist of a paranormal novel written in the twenty first century. Her only skill seems to be crying on cue. She won't stay where she could be safe but injects herself into every dangerous situation available so she can be rescued. The only time that she saves any one at all is when she saves the evil vampires and their human sheep. She does this because of some haft baked moral reason. Claire has no survival instinct at all and other then being a nice girl no redeeming values as a main charactor. If you want to read about a girl being rescued read THE PERILS OF PAULINE at least that story is in a time period that fits.
5,Terrific,"This book, like all the others in this series, is terrific. It's nonstop action from beginning to end, and the characters continue to develop. The more you learn about the characters, the more you like them and can relate to them. That doesn't always happen with books, sometimes the more you learn about the characters, the more they annoy you, so this is a nice change. Luckily I read all of these from Glass House up until Ghost Town one right after another, because I was late to the series, otherwise, the cliff-hangers may have driven me insane. That's the only warning I have to people considering starting this series, Ms Caine loves a cliff-hanger."
3,NOT MUCH OF A DANCE,I did enjoy reading it; however it did not live up to the 1st book. The character development is interesting though. Feels like it's slightly unfinished. Not a stand alone book-read book 1 first.
4,morganville vamps book 2,i have most of this series in hardcover book book two was the only one i didnt have and was happy to be able to get it
4,Dead Girl's Dance Review,"There is no place like Morganville! Rachel Caine keeps us entertained with Dead Girls' Dance, the second book in the Morganville Series. At the end of The Glass House Frank Collins, Shane's dad, came to Morganville to get rid of the vampires. In Dead Girls' Dance he kills a vampire and many humans. Since Morganville can't find Frank they will hold Shane responsible. Frank doesn't sit around waiting for his son to pay for his sins instead he kidnaps the Mayors daughter for leverage. Claire tries to find a way to save Shane, but she only manages to get deeper involved with Morganville's head vampires. Michael decides he can no longer live trapped in The Glass House and Eve is dealing with her new job at the collage. The book was great and a really fast read. If you haven't read this series I suggest you start.For more reviews visit: [...]"
5,The Morganville Vampires,this is the second book in the Morganville Vampire series and it is just as good as the first book you cannot put the books down once you start reading them. the 3 friends that live in the glass house are still together and are as one family claire isnt so much asthe ou cast but people are still after her and they continue to fight together to protect her. If you like the vampire stories this is a good one. I have read several series and this one is real good.
3,Good read. Not for teens.,"I read this for a book club. It's not bad. Not my favorite. However, I've heard that the series gets better in the following books."
3,review,not as great as the first one. i read maybe 100 pages and it didnt get going yet. im sure it will get better as i read on.
3,CD radio Inferno,"This was not what I expected. I only heard one track on iTunes Ambient Radio that was so great, but alass, the other tracks had wasy too much diolog."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Hi I had new monroe struts for my auto installed on 6/10/2009 from a local sears dealer at 6757 - Sears, Roebuck and Co. 6600 Menaul Blvd NEAlbuquerque, NM 87110 (505) 881-5690. strut part numbers were sensatrac 71951, 71952, 71953, 71954. Since that installation my car's steering wheel shakes or vibrates at freeway 70 mph speeds. I've taken it back to sears and they told me no trouble was found. I've had it in the shop at two other independent repair shops to verify it's not wheel balance or rotations. The problem started w/ the new monroe struts and I need the problem to finish with them. I'm at a loss for what to do next, save for filing a BBB compliant and contacting the bank to have the funds reversed.Thanks-Shawn"
5,Chef's choise,"Using this product for over 5 years and its hands down the best knife in my bag, I use it as a utility knife for most slicing and chopping. TO BE HONEST DONT THINK I EVER SLICeD A PIECE OF BREAD WITH IT."
4,Sound advise for software development,"True value of this book is its approach to developing software. Lots of technical information flows nicely with methodology and processes. For deep dive on different technologies used in this book, you will be better served looking at other sources, but come back to this book to understand execution and the glue-factor."
3,Entertaining,"It was entertaining to hear what other people think about LOST. That's it. Don't expect to find out any ""answers"" or ""unravelling"" of any kind. It's just fans talking about the characters and giving their opinions on the show. It was entertaining and I did laugh out loud several times. I would watch it again. Buy this if you are a die hard LOST fan. It's a nice fan-centric video."
3,Not to be confused with Mint ('Hinterland'/'Magnetism'),"There wasn't much info on ""American Style"" and another self-titled Mint album, but a combined $.65 for the two prompted me take a chance, thinking that they might possibly be earlier incarnations of the Belgium band Mint that recorded two great albums ""Hinterland"" (2008) and ""Magnetism"" (2006). They were not even close in quality to the latter, though I am not disappointed with the purchase; the songs are catchy though underproduced and a little like Rocket from the Crypt. If nothing else, it was worth the purchase price to hear another take on Madonna's ""Into the Groove."""
3,Maybe I missed the point,"Years ago when I read Jim's first book, Investment Biker, I was spellbound at his adventures. He told exciting tales while he offered investment insight as he traveled the world. In this latest book, I didn't find that excitement. Certainly there were episodes of interest, but I felt the book lacked overall interest. I was also disappointed at the lack of investment insight. Perhaps the point he was trying to make is that the world, at present, doesn't offer much investmenmt opportunity save for a couple of places that he specifically mentions."
4,"If I Had A Trillion Dollars, I Would...","Like anyone else working 9 to 5 I've often fantasized about around the world jaunts. Jim Rogers and his Wife, Paige actually did it in a bright yellow Mercedes. At times I found myself wondering what would have happened if the author hadn't had access to tons of cash, but for the most part this was an excellent book with an interesting perspective. Rogers blames government corruption for most of the problems in the world and views anti-American sentiment as the product of our idiotic governmental policies that alienate everyone. This book has brief, but telling statements to make about the future of investing and the state of the world to come. (Hint: Rogers is big on commodities). This book is hard to put down, but a little short on details."
5,A work to savor,"I savored every minute of this audiobook (5 hrs, 38 min.). Rogers is a southerner with a classically liberal turn of mind and a strong grasp of market economics. What fun to ""ride"" with him on a monumental excursion, and hear his myriad insights. This isn't an investment book, but his breezy prognostications for the future of various countries are surely valuable. In the end, I just like Jim Rogers. Here is one audiobook which might be more valuable than the printed book. His naration is quite pleasant, and it adds to the work's personality. Highly recommended for armchair economists and geographers."
2,Too bad the guy is such a wanker.,"For a guy who has all the money in the world and is doing something that is truly interesting, it's too bad he's such an arrogant wanker. Otherwise this book would be fantastic. Great idea, nice investment subplots, a plethora of interesting anecdotes, but I have toruble supporting Jim in any way. He's the kind of guy you want to punch in the face after listening to him for 10 pages. I still read the book and enjoyed parts of it, but I feel slightly tainted for passively supporting Jim Rogers."
1,Jim go away please,I really liked Investment Biker. I really hated this one.Jim is getting old and boring and it showed in this Un adventure book. I hope he doesn't write an annoying book about his kids next!Jupiter's Travels by Ted Simon is much better if you feel the need for a global trip type book.I was aghast when Jim and his way to pretty for him wife blew straight through central America. I have spent time in Nicaragua and his crap about meeting the US drug agent and his dogs is an insult to the wonderful people of Nicaragua. I can only imagine what he left out of places I am not so familiar.Don't forget Bill Bryson has some of the best biting travel books around. Sorry Jim I had to give you what you deserved.
1,Nothing New--just worthless drivel!!,"I am amazed how thw the author is able to perpetuate his image of being a market seer. His insight in this book barely penetrates the pages upon which the print is written. It's the same old harangue he presented in his previous books. Just empty gibberish amd platitudes. Given his wide exposure and attempts to market himself, I would like to think his ghost writer would be able to disclose some of hbis thoughts that I believe would be more perceptive than the pseudo author markets. I am tempted to return this one or give it to someone I do not like."
2,dissapointing trip,"Foe those of you who have yet to buy this book-don't waste your money. Rogers writes his typical negative, the US sucks and I'm the smartest guy in the world book. Anyone who's followed his advice over the years has earned a sub par return. He's been bearish on Russia forever and it's the #1 market in the world the past five years! Another example that ""guru's"" aren't worth listening to."
5,Best primer on world markets ever,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It's an entertaining tale of a very interesting guy and his big adventure. However, the best parts of the book are the insite and comments about the markets of the world, and the prediction of future trends."
3,road worrier,"I found this one ""paired up"" on the page for John Soltez's ""Only in America"" (why it was I'm not sure). One is excellent fiction, the other a ""real life"" story of a financial raconteur's risky exploits. Rogers doesn't come off as cocky on his CNBC appearances, yet it's interesting how many (especially non-Americans) find him arrogant in the extreme. Was it the car, or the attitude?"
4,An enjoyable read for both travelers and international minded investors,A good follow up to Investment Biker. Adventure Capitalist follows millionaire investor Jim Rogers on his second trip around the world (this time in a converted 4x4 sportscar) spanning 3 years at the turn of the 21st century. It's an equally fun narrative and no less insightful on the economies and investment prospects of each country.
4,Economics at ground level,"Nowhere else can you get as interesting, thorough and yet as accessible an insight into our world as in this book.The book masquerades as a travelogue but in fact it is a combination course in the geography, economics and politics of nearly the entire world at the time of the third millenium. The running commentary on the malignant impact of NGOs the world over, as just one example, is remarkable.A very easy read, this book is as entertaining as it is informative. Would that books and periodicals that intend to inform on these subjects did as good a job. Keep travelling, Jim, and keep writing!"
5,Excellent,"Jim Roger's knows investing, and he makes it interesting. Don't read this book if you think you're going to get a hot investment tip. He moves too quickly to focus on any one country's investment potential. It's a combination of geography, history, and capitalism. You will learn more about the state of the world than investing. I now know many tidbits about countries that I never knew previously.Do you know how Africa's geography will most likely change within the next two decades? Wonder how Apartheid is progressing in South Africa? The best African country to vacation in, and why? The freedom in China that we never hear about? The ""feed the children"" programs, and how they are corrupted once they ARRIVE in Africa?I've focuses in on Africa here, but that's what I found most interesting. Again, you will not become an expert currency trader here, but you will attain valuable insight into world affairs."
4,Strangely Compelling...,"Someone once said that poetry is not so much about the words as it is the sound of the human voice.This CD is proof positive of that.I have absolutely no idea what is being said (and although I am curious, it really doesn't matter), but the soundscapes created by the sound clips and electronica backgrounds renders this disc strangely compelling.From the opening ""kamaraden"" repeated eerily to great effect, through dozens of radio, newsreel and film sound bites stitched together, the cumulative effect is a strangely beautiful and subliminally disturbing as any Trent Reznor production."
4,Classical and lively,"Lovely, charming music that is fast paced and delightful to hear. Hard not to be impressed with the way this CD presents these works. However, orchestration is the limiting factor that does not allow the full range and complement of instruments to express the pieces."
2,Tough Shell But Poor Fitting Liner,"This cooler is certainly well constructed and tough, but I am disappointed by the fit of the inner liner. The heavy-duty liner is oversized for the shell, and has many folds that take up space and make it that much harder to clean and dry. I have much less expensive soft coolers that aren't as tough but have a well-fitted inner liner.Addendum Jan 2011. I returned the cooler to Polar Bear, who promised a ""new model with improved liner fit"". They returned, after 3 weeks, a cooler with the exact same liner. When I responded to this sham, they suggested that I purchase their more expensive model for medical supplies. I am disappointed in both the cooler and the deceptive customer service."
2,Not As Advertised,"We bought this cooler based on the following claim ""The Polar Bear will keep ice for 24 hours in 100 degree heat and will keep hot up to 200 degrees for hours"". Our ice would easily melt in just a few hours in less than 100 degree heat. This product definitely did not live up to the hype."
4,keeps it cold!,great for what I need...I deliver mail and the back of our trucks have no insulation from heat/cold...I use this to keep my water bottles and Gatorade. A bit bulky but it needs to be thick walled to be insulated. It took some breaking in but I was willing to work with it to get the benefit of keeping my drinks cold. My husband was amazed these past weeks where it has been over 100 degrees and my water is still cold when I get home! (if I have any left)
2,not as functional as it looks,"The outside is a durable canvas that looks to be good, but there is so much ""filling"" and inside liner that there is almost no room for food and drinks. It's also very difficult to close the zipper because the liner is too big.The advertisement said you could fit a six pack in there - we fit only 3 cans of soda!Don't waste your money. I don't want to bother sending it back because it's more effort than it's worth."
2,"The intention was good, but the execution is poor","I used this textbook as a graduate student in counseling psychology. The holistic approach, the attempt to present material in a novel way were all good. However, the textbook is poorly (if not hastily) written (in time for a publisher's deadline?) in that the information is not presented clearly and does not flow easily (at least, for a textbook). The authors seem to refer to the works of the same 5 or 6 authors, which to me is a sign of a biased approach despite their attempts at objectivity. The case examples are presented outside of a historic or cultural context and thus have limited value (at least for a counselor)."
5,Unique greatness.,"Patti LuPone is a legend in the same mold as Merman, Garland, and Streisand. This album confirms this judgement. Fantastic."
5,"If you don't know Patti already, this won't help.","I could gush, but you either love Broadway tunes or you don't. If you do, you should know Patti LuPone."
2,Star Strangled Belter,"LuPone is known throughout the theatre world as a performer who unnecessarily strangles works and muffles complicated lyrics. That said, she is in fact an interesting performer to watch - a somewhat disconcerting combination of emotional absence and audience disconnection. LuPone is also a fiercely patriotic American and enjoys telling everyone about it on her official website - but quite frankly, this album is just...eh...clambake."
5,Cinematic ambient jungle,"This is a really terrific album. Every track is exellent, but it's a full concept album that should be listened to from start to finish. I recommend it for anyone who has any liking of electronic music."
5,Outstanding!,"I bought this book in conjunction with Barron's Law Enforcement Spanish kit. ""Mexican Spanish - The Rough Guide"" is an outstanding pocket reference! I learned to conjugate verbs very easily given the simple description in the Rough Guide. I particularly like the contextual listings for words in the dictionary section. Very useful! I have several other Spanish books and dictionaries, and they are gathering dust now. I highly recommend this book."
1,Dazed and Confused,"As an earlier reviewer noted, Hawthorne must be rolling over in his grave. But so must Nabokov. The publisher actually has the nerve to compare Moody's pseudo-art with Nabokov's SPEAK, MEMORY! Do yourself a favor: Read a well-written memoir by someone whose story is worth telling. Open Moody's book, and you'll likely be aware of an irritating high pitch. I'll tell you what you're hearing: a grown man whining."
3,Stunning and tough and overcooked and victimized.,"Moody is brilliant. Don't be fooled by the poor showing here or the stupid attacks in many of the reviews (incl the TNR mess). This is a dense, tricky, complicated book that rewards the reader for every effort made. It's not a pretty book, and it's not an easy book. It's a book parts of which will haunt you for a long time. A gifted writer with extraordinary prospects. And yes, he overwrites, though even at that he's worse (better) than the half dozen other younger writers who think overwriting is a way out for writing today. Speaking DFW, JF, etc etc."
5,"Exquisite, moving memoir with literary genius","Whether Ricky Moody is related to Nathaniel Hawthorne or not, he is an equivalent talent. this is masterful, candid prose and entirely unique. Brave enough to admit depression in our haha society...Brilliant and honest. Make a space for Moody, on your bookshelf."
1,A Deeply Dishonest Book,"Moody has always been the most narcissistic and cynically careerist of the younger American writers, and this book -- the memoir of a man to whom nothing of special consequence has happened -- makes explicit what was implicit in the fiction. The Black Veil might be subtitled In Search of Credibility, as Moody documents, apparently without realizing how silly it is, his endlessly self-aggrandizing attempts to add weight to an essentially weightless life and body of work -- first by turning a minor drug and alcohol problem into an extended bout of slumming and melodramatic recovery-mongering, then by trying to link his work to that of one of the great Yankee masters. Neither effort yields much. Moody is the John Favreau of American fiction: not the real thing, but close enough to pass. The book is shallow, opportunistic, creepy-cold, and, finally, nauseating. For those of you wondering why his career has taken him so far, I offer two words: Ang Lee."
2,Digressive Nonsene,"This is the type of self-pitying tome that Hawthorne, Melville, or any other true New England artist would and could never have been accused of producing. To turn one's ancestry into some sort of self-involved paradigm is to feed the need of the modern middle class fest of narcicism. Give us all a break, please. You are, in the first place, uninteresting intellectually. You are also bouncing a ball repetitively against a backboard that is concave, thus sending the projectile back to you and you alone. The rest of us have laid our rackets down out of sheer disinterst. Trust the naysayers on this one."
1,One Star Too Many,"Before you buy this book, I suggest that you go to the New York Times' website and read Michiko Kakutani's insightful review of why Rick Moody's new book would be a waste of your hard-earned money. I only wish that I had seen her review first."
2,"Good writers, bad choices",It's sad to see such a brilliant writer like Moody turn out such a pompous and poorly executed book. One has to wonder if he was given good advice from his publisher -- he certainly wasn't edited by his editor.This book is destined to be his minor most book.
2,Neither devil nor angel--,"Moody is an interesting writer, bright, dedicated, a hard worker. Trouble is you have to sit there and watch him labor, and you have to bear it. This one is thick and deadly dull, overwrought, less than the sum of its parts. ...Skip this one and try someone you've never heard of."
5,Indecent Exposure,There is a certain kind of book that is so brilliant that its brilliance is a form of indecency. This is such a book. Writing doesn't get any better than this.
5,Great for improving your craft,"This is a new book containing old information about the correct way to make embroidrey stitches. I think it is a great book. It is a little difficult to read, but only because embroidery is such a visual and hands-on activity. I love how it goes into specific details as to how to make variations of different stitches. The pictures are black and white. The reading and examples of stitches are fairly easy to follow if you study the information and have some experience with embroidery. I do not have a lot of experience, I've done it off and on all my life (49 years); this book has made my work better quality and more attractive. I feel like I know what I'm doing, so I'm not embarrassed for others to look at."
1,Don't waste your money! BORING!,"This software title is not like the others of which some are well done and keep my 2 year old grandaughter interested. This software title is totally BORING! It just keeps repeating their name, and then askes yours. Then that segments just ends! no goodbye or nothing! Just stops. Even the original CD that came with the keyboard is much better. This one is horrible. There is no imagination at all unless the child wants to make up a name for themselves. SHEESH!"
2,Identify eight prototypes of team roles,"The MECE of the eight roles are doubtful, making the analysis on team strengths difficult to be brought into practice.It is a nice try to do a MECE classification on team roles, but there are still room for improvements in this book."
3,A clever adult film with realistic characters,"This film is an adult comedy and not meant to be taken at all seriously. People who liked quirky movies such as ""The Big Picture"" (Kevin Bacon, Teri Hatcher) and ""Bodies, Rest, and Motion"" (Bridget Fonda, Eric Stoltz, Phoebe Cates) will probably appreciate this. The plot and production are not as good as in the other two, but it is extremely clever and funny, not to mention erotic. The characters are three-dimensional and believable, and there are plenty of smart lines that keep it interesting."
4,Just barely off the mark,"This is the only album Dead On ever recorded, and it's a shame. There were a lot of good riffs on here, nothing groundbreaking, but lots of fun. In reference to the other review, Different Breed is probably the best song on the album (either that or Merry Ship...maybe Full Moon, too). It'll hold your attention throughout though. The Megadeth comparison was pretty accurate, the riffs are quite fast and complex. The weak point of the album is probably the singer, he uses an odd nasal/ rasp delivery which takes a bit of getting used to. The quality of the music makes up for his deficiencies, though."
3,"O.K. book, but wouldn't recommend",This book has a fakely cheerful tone to it and gets a bit annoying at times. The Butterworths sound like a nice family but I did not gain much from reading this book.
5,Excellent,Excellent summary of this subject. ziman is a well-regarded expert on this subject.He was a professor at Oxford for many years.
4,Starting Carving,This is the first book I bought for carving. I really liked the way each step was laid out. Most carving books go from rough out to finish in one picture but Ron shows you every cut needed to obtain a quility carving. If you are a begining carver get started carving with this book.
5,GREAT CHRISTIAN MUSIC,"If you are a Christian with a deep love for inspiring and uplifting Christian music, then this is certainly a CD you will be pleased to own. They are great songs with timeless Christian themes. I gladly and whole-heartedly recommend this CD to any Christian regardless of the denomination. The only thing that baffles me is its price: why is it this costly? Well... good things cost and I'm certain in spite of the price you will still thank God for its beauty, simplicity, poetry, groundedness on scriptures and relevance to real life, and its effects on your soul."
5,exhilerated,I first heard Silverwind right after I got serious about walking with God..Their sound was unique and definitely annointed with the Holy Spirit...I had not seen anything by them in years--had not thought of them in years..One day for some reason they came to mind and I thought AMAZON..Sure enough there was a listing of Silverwind GOLD...not just the artists but the songs I loved and remembered...I highly recommend this CD to anyone who loves God..The seller did a fantastic job in swift delivery and packaging..First thought it was kind of pricey but there are 22 tracks on that CD..all great!
5,Silverwind -- GOLD!,"Silverwind music inspired my daughter and I was delighted to find a replacement CD for her here on Amazon. Our daughter has Down's Syndrome, but she is a very musical person. She would recommend it and I will too."
5,Genuine HP,"This is the large sized replacement ink cartrige. It's genuine HP out of the box...IT""S NOT a refilled, re-sold, ripoff. Good ink at nearly the best price around with reliable Amazon shipping."
5,Home office,Came as promised in it's box and worked great at a great price. I really like this product and buy it as needed and never dis-pointed. Thanks Cindy
1,Ruining Rubik's name...,"If you think this toy is anything like original Rubik's cube, you are wrong. This toy has no moving parts and it is a challenge to a 5 year old for 5 minutes and this cheap plastic will not grab imagination of even a 3 year old.What a shame the marketing of this toy is totally misleading."
4,"Great Fun, But No Durability.","The rubik's revolution is a great toy, but it lacks durability. After just a minute of use the green stickers already started to peel off. However, unlike a normal rubik's cube where you would have to buy a pack of $5 sticker replacements, you can easily glue the stickers back on with a glue stick. All i all the rubik's revolution is an overall great toy."
4,Lots' of fun for the whole family,"Purchased as a christmas gift for my kids, my husband and I enjoyed the challenges also. wish there was a volume control button"
1,"Stink, stank, stunk!","I'm honestly embarassed to have fallen for this junk. I'm an avid gamer and puzzle player and find this to be one of the most inane, worthless ""puzzles"" to come along in quite a while. Ultimately, this is little more than a rehash of the old ""Simon"" game (and an inferior version at that!).As noted by others here, I completely expected the game to be some variation of the Rubik's cube. No doubt, the pieces are designed to *look* as though they can be moved and rotated, so the manufacturers seem to want prospective buyers to believe that. Unfortunately, I fell for that deceptive ploy. I only hope I can help to prevent others here from making that same mistake. At the very least, please find a way to actually try this thing out before spending your money on it."
1,IS NOT A RUBIKS CUBE,"Is a big piece of junk. Not fun at all and has nothing to do with Rubiks cube, it just seems like. I couldn't give it zero stars, I wish I could.It doesn't turn or rotate, it lasted the time it took me to smash it on the floor, because once opened it can not be returned. I've been ROBBED. Don't throw away your money with this junk."
1,No real rubik cube functionality.,This toy is a total disappointment. It's just a bunch of push the lighted buttons games and not even a functional rubik cube.
4,Good for concentration.,"Received very quickly, would purchase from again. Never could figure out the original Rubic's, but find this one fun."
1,A big waste of money,"This is a Rubik's Cube look-alike that lights up and makes way too much noise - very loud, annoying noise at that. The noise can be turned off, but then there is nothing but the lights to attract players. Our granddaughter liked playing it to get faster at selecting the blinking lights, but became bored with doing that and just began spinning it for the noise."
5,"Great toy, great challenge for little hands too!","This is one toy that can definitely span age groups. From about 3 on up, this thing sure is a bunch of fun! We've had ours for two years now and it still keeps on going. If you think the cubes are going to move around like a regular Rubik's cube, it won't. It's more of a master of hand-mind that it is in solving a puzzle. Hand-eye coordination skills are severely needed in this game, which makes it a must for little ones too in keen development stages. Great, great toy, we highly recommend it! Hubby can't put it down!"
4,Not what I expected,"When my son asked for this for Christmas, I thought it was a talking rubik's cube that helped you solve the puzzle. Does not spin like a traditional rubik's cube. Must not have been as fun as he thought as it was on the shelf by the next week."
1,Sham Marketing is Right,"It's almost a cruel joke on Rubik's fans. Buy it thinking it's an advanced version of the old favorite and find out that the pieces don't even move. The ""games"" that are programmed are nothing more than pressing lights as fast as you can. Clearly meant to lure in people hoping to solve a puzzle, but there's actually nothing to solve. Cheap plastic too. The idea that it costs anything more than a dollar is outrageous. The gall, the gall . . ."
4,"A fun toy, mostly about fast reflexes","Although it's not terribly complex, this is a pretty fun toy. It's mostly about trying to beat the clock and develop quick reflexes so that you can press the right buttons and turn off flashing lights fast enough so that the cube doesn't turn itself off and make an irritating ehh-ehh-ehh beeping sound.I think you can ignore most of the negative reviews this has gotten on Amazon -- they mostly seem to be from avid fans of the old, original Rubik's Cube who didn't understand that this is a different toy, and somehow feel cheated that the Rubik brand has been used for a new purpose. But if they had read the packaging or tried the toy out in the store they would have known this is a different product altogether and maybe not got so upset. I tried this in the store and enjoyed it, same with my kid and same with our relatives. It's a fun toy -- lighten up!"
1,Not a Rubik's cube,"I purchased this at a toy store thinking it was some sort of giant electronic Rubik's cube. It is not. It does not twist or turn. It simply looks like it might. Instead it is a solid chunk of plastic that plays Simon like games, in which you press buttons on the center of each side. If you want an oddly shaped Simon game, this might be the toy for you. But if you are considering this item because it has the ""Rubik's"" name on it and it looks like the classic puzzle you should probably reconsider.I feel very misled and wish I had not purchased this item. The packaging does not state what it does or does not do. They are leveraging the shape and name of the cube to sell something completely unrelated."
1,Disappointing ...it doesn't even turn!,I was mislead into buying it because of its visual resemblance to the original Rubik's cube and of course the name Rubik. But it does not even remotely resemble the original cube in concept and functionality. It DOES NOT TURN! The recorded voice that talks to you is harsh and irritating. For me it is a worthless piece of junk. I just bought it a couple of hours ago and it is definitely going back to the store.
2,The stickers came off,"My daughter enjoyed this toy but after several days of palying with rubik's revo, the stickers started to come off. Its a hassle because we have to glue it back again and wait until the glue dries up."
1,Doesn't turn,"I expected it to turn but it doesn't. This is not revolutionary, it is a regression to stupidity. While it is a cube resembling a Rubik's Cube, it is not worthy of the Rubik name."
2,In response to the comments on negative reviews,"In response to the comment saying this is a completely different toy then a rubik's cube because its pieces do not actually move, this toy is rather misleading and if one is not careful enough to see that it isnt a puzzle, they will be dissapointed the day they get it. Just be sure you know what your buying before purchasing this. Personaly, I think its one of those toys that is fun for 5 or 10 minutes and then it becomes borring, unlike original rubik's cubes :)"
3,Lighted Buttons are fun,"Pretty good toy for all ages. Younger kids can enjoy the lighted buttons, and it's okay to check it out just as a fun game--nothing that has to be complicated, but playing it will probably grow old in time like a lot of toys."
3,Rubik's Revolution let-down,"This was a gift for my daughter who is 12 years old. She acted as if she really wanted it and loved it, but after she got it for Christmas and owned it, she never used it again. Unfortunately , I think it was just one of those things she had to have and the novelty of it just wore off."
2,Revolution Rubik not a winner,I was disppointed in myself for not reading the description of the non-moving sides. In a household of 4 including adults no one was impressed. I won't be buying a Rubik again.
4,Fun but way to loud,I saw this game on TV and it looked fun.I got it and its even better then I thought.There are 6 games that most are familar to me . So I enjoyed it.The only downside is it is way to loud. People on a diffrent floor can hear it .It has a volume control . But it doesn't go down far enough.I would play it more if the sound wasn't so loud and ear piercing.
5,Great Gift,I bought this for my son's stocking stuffer and boy did he have fun. Great gift and works great too!
4,A REAL SURPRISE,I really didn't know what I was buying when I gave it to my Grandson. I thought it was the old Cube. But this was different. It was fun and challening and something the family could play together. My grandson is 5 and we had a blast playing with it. It's fun for the younger one's because more then one can play and for the older kid's they will enjoy it as well because it can be hard. I had fun because my grandson is only 5 and I would help him and we had a great time
4,"Good for memory, but LOUD!!","My 6th grader loves this toy. It's great for building memory skills, similar to the old Simon game. There's one interactive game that you can play with 2 people. You pass it back and forth at fast speeds. But there is no volume control, and you cannot turn off the noise.... Annoying! Some games have a woman's robotic voice, other games have a really loud beeeping noise. Definitely cannot use this without bothering everyone in the house!!"
3,Fun but a piece of junk,My daughter loved this toy up until it didn't work properly. The blue button no longer works. This happened only having the toy for 1 week.She is very didappointed becaud=se the toy is rally alot of fun. I would really like to replace it if possible. I am wondering if anyone else had this happen to their toy.Thanks.
5,Rubik's Revolution,I bounght this as a Christmas present for my five-year-old niece. She loved it. It kept her occupied for over an hour even with all the other Christmas presents she had to play with. I highly recommend it!
1,New-fangled isn't always better,"I bought two of these as Christmas stocking stuffers for my kids, ages 8 and 18. After seeing the commercial, I'd thought this was simply a standard Rubik's cube with noise (like just about every other toy has these days).In reality, it's not the same thing at all. The pieces don't even move! Yes, there's an instruction manual that explains the various games which you can supposedly play on it, but that was one of the first things each kid lost, and after that it's impossible to play with.So now, rather than a Rubik's cube for Christmas, it turns out I gave them both square paperweights that will no doubt be in the trash by the end of next week."
5,Revolution Crazy,"I bought this for my 13 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves this game better than the original cube. However, she can only play it when her 17 year old sister lets her...lol.As a parent the noise level drives me crazy, but because the kids love it I don't mind as much."
5,This game is addictive!!!,"My 9 year old got this for Christmas because she had liked it when one of her friends from school brought it in. I had NO IDEA how hooked I was going to get! It's great for every age (my 6 year old loves it as much as I do.) It is a lot of fun and the different games are very challenging, and if you're at all competitive you just keep trying to beat your last score. It even has a multi-player mode, which is nice if you have kids who are always fighting over whose turn it is next!The only drawback -- it is a little loud and the noise does get a little annoying after a while."
2,Disappointed,"Ok, I admit it. I did not really read much about this toy before I bought it. My 7 year old asked for it and I bought it. I guess I wanted to relive part of my youth from when the original Rubik's cube hit the stores. Unfortunately, this toy is nothing more than a light game. It does not rotate like the original. There is really nothing educational about it. It not really challenging. You just push the light that is blinking and hand it to the next person. And it is LOUD! I thought it was going to be a really cool, new version of the classic. Serves me right for not reading about it first."
2,"An ok game, but it has nothing in common with a Rubik's cube","As a game, it's ok. It plays a lot likeMerlin Electronic Puzzle Gamewhere each of the different games is basically some variation on pressing the buttons in a particular order. One thing annoying about the design is that the button on each side (the middle square on each side is a button) is recessed about about an inch into the body making it difficult to press. That may be the intent of the designers, but I just found it frustrating.However it is pretty shameless marketing to present this game as some sort of Rubik's type of puzzle since it has nothing in common with a Rubik's cube or that style of puzzle. If you buy this expecting something similar to a Rubik's cube type of puzzle you will be sorely disappointed."
1,"Misleading, not Rubik's cube related at all.","This is a poor press-the-light-quickly game which has been wrapped up to look like a Rubik's cube. It has NOTHING to do with a Rubik's cube, it has no puzzle to it, the pieces do not move.DO NOT BUY this thinking it is Rubik's cube related, it is not. It might as well be shaped like Elmo's head or something."
4,Fun toy that caused lots of laughs,"I bought this for my younger sister because she recently bought the standard old school one. I bought it for her birthday kind of as a joke and for fun. When she first turned it on, the robotic female voice started to talk which made us all laugh. She tried several of the different games, some harder than others. Then I tried for a few minutes. She played it a few more times after. After this the orange button does not work most of the time which doesn't help especially for a game that relies on how fast you press the buttons. So now we don't play it at all. I don't know if the seller would replace it since it's been so long since I ordered it, plus it could just be a deffective one. But for how cheap this item is, I don't think it's worth going through the whole return process especially if I have to pay any of the shipping.If the product wasn't deffective, I'm sure it would still be tons of fun."
3,"Fun, but so LOUD!","Bought this for my husband for Christmas because he loves Rubiks. It's fun, but so loud. There's some sort of formula for turning the volume dowm, but we can't figure it out! Other than the volume, it is GREAT!!"
3,Fun Toy,The product was not what I thought it would be. It has still been fun and am glad that I purchased it.
1,Gets Pretty Stupid,I liked it at first. But it just got stupid! It became annoying! The first one i bought broke first thing and i ordered another. Still just don't buy this there are things much better.
3,Kind of a Drag,"I don't know about anyone else's opinion of this book, but I thought it was boring. The book focuses on Will and Melissa's relationship and future, but there's nothing new happening until the end. Also, Conner is starting to alienate everyone he cares about because of his drinking: Andy, Liz, Tia... get the picture? I'm beginning to wish that Liz and Evan would get together. Anyone agree?"
3,it is okay,"this book is quite boring because it is very long winded. it is too, because i don't really like the characters in the story."
2,Plots a little lame...,"A lot of these plots are a little lame. The writing itself is excellent & I love the little diary entries, but why in Sweet Valley's name is almost everyone( except Andy) hooked up & so many of the plots revolving around romance? I can some of the plots being romance, but all of them? And boy! Do Jessica & Jade have a lot of growing up to do! Jessica broke up with Jeremy, yet she falls into a jealous huff because Jade's going out with him. I thought it was so spiteful of her to bring Jeremy over to where Jade was with another guy, then tries to get Jade fired from her job. And Jade...I liked the Jade in the old series better; it's really too bad that Francine changed Jade too much like that. Jade used to be thoughtful in the old series & into ballet; now in this new series, Jade's only interests seem to be cheerleading & getting boyfriends to show off. I really wish this series would get deeper plots. That would make this series a lot better."
4,just a critic from cali,This book was ok. It was so predictable though. I mean anyone would have known that Will was going to get hurt. Because his life seemed so perfect and that can't be in a sweet valley book now can it. There really isn't any new surprises in the series anymore.
3,ok but not great,this book was ok but i didn't like jade she seemed really rude and annoying. she wanted everything her way and she didn't even think it was wrong when she cheated on jeremy. and also what ever happend to lila?
3,Pretty good,"I bought and read this book, because I used to live in Connecticut, and it was a ""Nutmeg Award"" Nominee which is the top children's book in the state as voted by students. I read it and thought it was enjoyable, but nowhere near as fun or interesting or even well-written as his My Teacher.. series. I guess I was expecting a lot, and this book had a lot in it, space travel, monsters, hot monsters, a pet monkey, going to the land of the dead, alien invasions, separation of spirits. You would think it was amazing, but you only get half of the story, the part from Anthony's point of view, and from no one else in the story. The book could have been finish in less than 150 pages but lasts until 221 with the epilogue, and then it seems like it stops. It should have been two books, the Epilogue should be longer and tell what has happened in better detail, and the middle of the book should be anywhere else. I liked it, but can not see how it won the Nutmeg, or any award."
4,Choose your thinking style to match your challenge,"Length:: 1:21 MinsThis book not only classifies the types of thinking but also tells you how to use them. Reviewed in sixty seconds (more or less) by Jurgen Wolff, author of ""Focus: use the power of targeted thinking to get more done.""Focus: Use the Power of Targeted Thinking to Get More Done"
4,I think you will like it!,"As a Christian entrepreneur, published author, speaker, and consultant, I am always looking for material to inspire, teach, and strengthen me; for insights that I can assimilate and information I can pass on to others to help them grow. John is one of the most successful authors in this genre and I generally value the material he produces. What Thinking for a Change lacked in originality it most certainly makes up in presentation. That is, it is well organized and does, without a doubt, contain useful information that will help you, through eleven main thinking areas, evaluate the way your mind works and the way you view success. My only criticism is that this book, like many of the author's other works, is largely focused on the secular business world and leaders therein. That being said, it is an excellent read and I would recommend it without hesitation.Reviewed by: (...)"
5,Another Winner by John Maxwell,"This is another great book that causes you to think about what you are doing or what you should be doing. It is written in the John Maxwell style that makes it easy to understand, easy to read and more importantly very easy to implement in your life. I particularly loved his description of creative thinking when he said, """"Creativity is being able to see what everybody else has seen and think what nobody else has thought so you can do what nobody else has done!"" Typical John Maxwell thinking! This book should be in everyone's personal library but ONLY if they follow the suggestions."
5,Think! Think! Exclaims Maxwell,"Maxwell uses extensive quotes, examples, and lessons from great thinkers and leaders throughout history to prove his point that critical thinking is essential for any person aspiring to assume leadership within an organization, or to gain control of one's personal life. Critical thinking is absent in corporate America today, and Maxwell strives to teach the reader to adopt new mental habits to analyze and resolve situations both within and without the boardroom.Maxwells' book presents a rationale for focused, creative, shared, realistic, strategic, possibility, reflective, popular, and bottom-line thinking. Maxwell devotes a chapter to each of these areas in his highly readable writing style.You may also want to read ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napoleon Hill and ""The 17 Principles of Creating Wealth"" by Phillip Collinsworth."
2,not worth the money,"A mediocre, intellectually lazy piece of work that will be of moderate value to beginners. Its basic points are valuable to those who have not been exposed to this structure, but it sorely lacks depth, committment to its subject, or the information value to hold the interest of a reader of above average mental capacity."
5,You're thinking right now...right?,"Several years ago, one of the best leaders I know, someone who managed to rise to the top of every organization he was ever in --including the one he currently works for, told me the secret to his success. ""Think like a leader,"" he said. I've often meditated on his words. I've discovered that they are absolutely true...In his book, Maxwell explains how you can leverage the power of your thoughts to acheive unthinkable success: He gives you all the different ways leaders think and then shows you how to do it yourself. Just like my friend said: ""Think like a leader."" Order this book and find out how."
3,Very Helpful with Lots of Insight,"Good read that clarified some thinking styles for me. For example, Thinking Realisticaly vs Thinking Negatively. Best quote I found in this book was ""Hurting People Hurt Others""."
5,A+,item is as described. No complaints. shipping was satisfactory. thank you very much . god bless and have a great day
5,Kentucky Derby Greatest Moments DVD,"During a time of very few horse racing DVDs, this item is a real gem. It features wonderful footage of past and present Kentucky Derbies - Triple Crown champions, fan favorites, upsets, etc. Citation, Secretariat, Barbaro, Iron Leige -- they are all here. The stories behind the races are brief and to-the-point; they don't overshadow the action. If you love Thoroughbred horse racing, this DVD is for you."
2,"So, So, not great","The narration, it became obviously the Narrator knew nothing about horsing racing. Just reading lines,he ruined the movie for me."
4,Good Film,"The derby moments was good although, I was expecting a little more about certain horses. They show great footage from all winners( esp. secretariat and citation) but was displeased that they didn't show much of affirmed and how close he was to losing the race! Overall I will watch this film again sometimes."
4,Brief but tight,"For those who like fast-paced electronica/D&B without filler, try this. Not to be confused with the song ""Brown Paper Bag"" which I've heard over the speakers in Best Buy and so must have been more successful than this (quite undeservingly), Bagman has a distinct, driving sound that doesn't neglect actual elements of music. There are splashes of reggae, Japanese traditional (?), and a warped baby doll (on Mama) that keep the fast rhythms and bass fresh. A few more tracks like those would have made this album a classic."
2,Seems like a first story adventure,"This adventure is full of puzzles and the storyline idea behind it can easily be beaten with a DM's creative mind or using a free mini-game storyline from a link or magazine. The whole comcept is very ""cliche"" with spinx, crags on the beach. The items dont makes much sense for players to figure out unless it is trial and error. ie: they find silly putty which about 4 maps later must use it on a sign to store its lettering so that they dont forget due to the ""forget"" spell on the sign. Feels like a video game where you must try out every single found item on each clue just to figure out the combination. Out of the whole 3 book series, this is the weakest."
4,Breaking Taboos,"In India, where it is set, Fire, Deepa Mehta's first installment in the infamous trilogy Fire, Earth and Water, caused riots when it was presented to the public. Some cinemas that dared to offer it were, ironically, set on fire. The subject of lesbianism is taboo among Hindus, who as one of the characters reveals, have no equivalent word in their vocabulary.In spite of the controversy, Mehta's treatment in large part, is subtle, tender and evocative. Though the males, particularly Jatin, are somewhat predictable and typical, the female leads, Radha and Sita, are believable and sympathetic. Mehta makes effective use of Hindu mythology as metaphor, and the film resonates simply through its handling of colour."
5,Always rejuvenates my spirit and gives me hope,"A courageous and up-lifiting. film. I watch this when I need my faith in the human spirit renewed. Leonard Maltin's review is quite frankly an insult to a great film. The pace, design and acting are flawless. The male characters are chauvinistic to say the least, but it is difficult not to symapthize some with the servant and the younger husband. When the older husband is telling Radha that she should 'ask his forgiveness and touch his feet,' any thinking, caring person should be filled with outrage. To see these women defy patriarchy so unabashedly gives me great hope that the lives of women in less-developed countries will continue to improve this century."
