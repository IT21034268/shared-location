3,Audition,"This film was shot in just two weeks which is quite hard to belive when you see the film. Audition begins as an any averige drama with absolutely no sings of any horror. The second part is in every way pretty much of an opposite of the first and for the warning to some viewers: it goes pretty violent at the end. Miike is very professional and skillful filmmaker with an amazing filmography including almost 60 films(from during the past 15 years!!!). This strange, and once again disturbing mixture of different styles showcases his talent in cinematic storytelling , but in expection of the very graphic imaginery Audition doesn`t stand out to be not much more than a typical revenge story. It is still a littlebit normbreaking in the way it deals sovinism in the japanise culture. Actually it can be seen as a womens payback to men."
3,twiiiiiiisted,"i must admit this one drags, and some scenes may be irrelevant, but i think the message goes beyond that. do not, i repeat, DO NOT objectify women. haha. lesson learned! A+ on the blood and violence!! ; )"
3,Definitely not acupuncture....,"You must see this movie for yourself to believe the hype. It sneaks up on you and pays off in the end. For me, I can only watch this movie once, and I have since resold it, but the horrific images have stayed in my mind.Definitely a creepy, sick movie. The eventual fate of the main character is almost too much to bear. To reveal any more would spoil this movie to the uninitiated. See this movie once, then get rid of it. It will haunt you for days afterward, and you'll wonder why you willingly watched such loathsome horror."
2,Kinda boring.,"I guess I don't fully understand why everyone seems to rave about this film. The last half hour is filled with all sorts of odd non-sequitor flashbacks. The pace of this film is glacial at best. If you have nothing better to do for two hours, sure, watch it. If you have anything else to do, skip this film."
4,A good intro to Takashi Miike,"My girlfriend introduced me to Takashi Miike's twisted style of storytelling with Ichi The Killer and I have seen a hand full of his other films, but for some reason I had put this one off because I had heard there were scenes that would burn into your retina's and stay there for years to come. This is my most recent viewing from his extensive works. While not as sexually perverse as Visitor Q, or bloody as Ichi, Audition is a slow build into 'ewwww' shock.If you haven't experienced Miike's style, this is a great introduction. It builds over the course of the movie (a bit slow at times) and the final 20 minutes or so is where the payoff comes. Most consider this one of his best works, but if you really want twisted, Try Visitor Q."
3,Interesting but not as good as I expected,"I thought this film was interesting but I was expecting more. As several other people have noted, it is very, very slow for an hour and very little happens. I was starting to fall asleep at one point; only the hot laptop on my lap kept me awake (I watched the movie over my laptop through Netflix). It's only in the last 20 min. or so that the movie picks up and becomes more intriguing and creepy. I think I would have liked it more if the creep factor had come into play a little sooner. However, I liked the actors and I thought overall it was a good movie. I probably wouldn't recommend it to most people because of the brief torture scene. It didn't bother me that much but I realize a lot of people get pretty freaked out by scenes like that. (I was expecting the movie to be much more extreme in its depiction of violence, having read and heard some other reviews of it.) I wouldn't buy a copy of it, but I enjoyed it."
3,Blind Date From Hell,A nasty example of the cinema of cruelty-more Polanski than Hitchcok. The film is brilliantly crafted and it will freak you out-but unless you have a taste for extreme torture this is not your cup of tea.
1,"aweful movie, waste of time","This movie started out with potential, but then got dragged out, and ending was really weird and bizarre. Don't waste your time. Wished someone had warned me. Stay away!"
2,PAINFULLY SLOW & POINTLESS,"I heard the movie's ending was voted as having one of cinema's most horrific scenes, so I jumped at checking this little horror story out. I was not only disappointed at the direction, but the slow-moving plot and character development was making me climb the walls.Enough.Instead, rent GOZU and I dare you not to write a review after witnessing the movie's climax. Some people gasped out loud in the Seattle theater I saw it at.Completely unreal and unlike any Lynch or Croneneberg film I've ever seen.Dares all around to any cinematic horror buff . Now go ""enjoy GOZU""."
2,Bland,"I like Haruki Murakami(the original writer of this movie) and also the director Takashi Miike, but I couldnft find much esplendourf in the film.Acting: The leading actress is creepy enough to act the torturer, but thatfs it; nothing more than that, nothing less than that. Although the leading actor Ryo Ishibashi is nice and Ren Osugi is outstanding as the creature in a filthy bag.Plot: Haruki Murakami writes absurd, vivid and imaginal story. Thatfs why the entire story is like some sort of a dream(or nightmare?). To me, it was too prose. Ifd rather imagine scenes by reading the book than see them in a movie.If you donft like to see someone torturing or being tortured in any way, avoid this one. Disgusting scenes are including."
3,Interesting film marred by overrated ending,"I found this film unsettling and nicely subtle until the final reel. Good performances all around and a nice sense of suspenseful buildup. However, the famous ending was not at all horrific or terrifying. I found it rather tame, actually, and was expecting a lot more. In fact, so many people hyped up the ending that I had to ask, ""What has everyone so freaked out?"" Really, it was no big deal. So three stars from me for a decent little film with a terribly over-hyped ending."
3,Truly Un-Shocking,"Audition is a very well made, handsome drama with one or two interesting scenes and one or two not-terrifying or disturbing scenes of violence thrown in at the end. If you enjoy Japanese drama this will be right up your alley. If you are looking for something intense, depraved, suspensful, scary or violent - then you'll have to sit through 115 minutes of character development and padding to get to the meat of the fun. NOT for the ADD-riddled viewer."
5,HIGH OUT OF PRINT PRICES,"Don't pay over $100 for this out of print dvd. If you have a PAL player or PAL converting dvd player, get the German dvd for under $30 from hkflix.com. The German release by rapid eye movies is a beautiful, anamorphic transfer. The quality of the transfer is much better than the UK or Asian versions and even beats the US release, which is NOT anamorphic. [...].This disc is region 0, but you must have a dvd player that can convert PAL or a PAL system. This disc has almost no extras, but if you have a widescreen tv, you'll like the way it looks."
2,Why Couldn't This Have Been a Short Film?!?,"Thank Gawd for TiVO! It took me 3 days to finish this film. I'm surprised I didn't delete it after the first stop. I guess because I thought *Audition* would finally have something that would have made it worth watching. NOT!It was long and boring. The movie didn't get interesting (if you can call it that) until the last half hour or so.7 years after his wife has passed away, Aoyama decides to date again. Upon a plan devised with a friend, Aoyama holds an audition. After interviewing 30 women, he chooses Asami, a former ballerina with an abused childhood.However, Aoyama's friend investigates Asami's background and presents the inconsistencies to Aoyama. Of course, being infatuated with Asami, Aoyama ignores his friend's findings. This is where Aoyama gets in trouble.I still cannot believe I didn't delete this movie after the first stop. Sigh..."
1,Don't bother,"I'm sorry. This movie had few redeeming qualities except for the photography. To compare it to Memento - no. I found no ""deep meaning"" in Audition. Only a picture for those that like to see how much pain they can take. Technically the subtitles were easy to read which is not always the case in foreign films.Rent this movie if you HAVE to see it. Don't let children view it. On second thought, don't rent it. This movie is a waste of time."
1,Excruciating,"Unless you love gore, avoid this film like the plague. I speak Japanese well and routinely enjoy Japanese cinema, but this movie has little redeeming merit.It is far too disjointed. While I enjoy putting together pieces of a puzzle, I'd rather not work from a box in which random pieces from five different puzzles are jumbled together.Needless gore combined with mindless stream-of-consciousness film-making. Ugh. I don't quite have the words to describe how much I disliked this film. Caveat emptor."
2,Dissapointment,"The only horror throughout this entire movie is found in the last fifteen minutes or so! The rest of the movie is basically a love story that backfires. I adore Asian Horror, but this film does not live up to its normal standards."
2,Is everyone crazy?,"How in the world is this movie getting such great reviews? For starters, it's not a horror film... Despite constanly being rated one of the best horror films ever made. I've coughed up scarier stuff than this.Basically, if you want to fall asleep watching a movie then this is the one to get. There is a pretty disturbing 20 minute gorefest at the end. If you're into that then you might like the movie. Otherwise, avoid this movie like the plague."
1,DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE!,"THIS MOVIE IS LAME! I BOUGHT IT FOR 24.95 AND IT'S NOT WORTH THE POSTAGE! IF YOU PAY MORE THAN 19.95 FOR THIS CRAP YOU DESERVE TO LOSE THE MONEY -- I FELL FOR IT, I HOPE YOU DON'T!"
5,Happy Valentine's Day.....,"This was the first Miike film I saw (and one of the first films I rented from Netflix), and I still can't get it out of my mind. It's an incredibly creepy, visceral, astonishing film, one of Miike's many masterpieces, and one of the greatest date movies ever. The thing is about this film is that it never feels exploitative. It's kind of sad, as you really feel for the widower at the beginning of the film, and when he's tortured at the end of the film by his ""wife"", it's even harder to watch (I've seen this film twice, and it's still uncomfortable to watch the final 20 minutes or so, which shows you how effective the film is). In the hands of a lesser director, it would be a ""torture porn"" film, reveling in the violence with no real substance. Miike's films do have something to them other than gratuitous gore, and this is one of the best examples of his greatness."
3,"Subtle, la de da, then BANG!","This is not really a horror movie. More like a thriller along the lines of ""Fatal Attraction"" in my opinion. Something is not quite right with this love story. Asami seems sweet and beautiful, but she's awfully weird! Too bad Shigeharu is in such a hurry to find a new wife that he doesn't stop to thnk about Asami's actions or really look into her background. Fantastic acting by the girl that plays Asami, especially at the end! The commentary by Takashi Miike is not to be missed. He gives some interesting insights into his film. I enjoyed this movie, and I am glad I saw it, but it's probably not something I would watch more than once. The buildup is pretty long and drawn out."
2,a bit too much,"There has been a few previous reviews stating that this isn't really a ""horror"" film in the truest sense, and they're probably right...but i have to say that Audition succeeded in scaring me...bad. Audition has some unbelievably frightening moments, and there is an extremely unsettling mood running throughout the entire film. In this sense, Audition is truly good.But I can't come away saying I enjoyed it. The graphic representations of torture and twisted sexual themes running through the latter part of film were just too much for me. I think this film is artistically brilliant, I really do, but some things are so disturbing that no matter how brilliant the art may be, I just can't come to terms with it. If you can handle torture and violence on this level, or can appreciate film regardless of its how disturbing it might be, then I really think you'll find Audition a superb film. I can't get past them. And it's a shame because I really want to like this film."
4,Makes you squirm and shudder...,"Some very realistic scenes make this a truly creepy movie in the end. It takes a true sadist to come up with this stuff, but thats alright by me. It's well acted, well written, and has a David Lynch feel throughout. Well worth a couple of viewings.4 1/2 stars."
4,Not Disappointed,"I procrastinated. For one reason or another I kept putting off buying this DVD. But that only fed my expectations. I shouldn't have allowed them to get too high but, lucky for me, I was not diappointed.Although I understand the complaints in some reviews about the slow pacing of the movie, I disagree that it was boring. The subtle camera angling, amber lighting, conservative use of a score, long moments of silence punctuated by sudden bursts of action, the occasional intercutting of disturbing flashbacks. All these devices riding the surface of a very sympathetic storyline made me uneasy, and my uneasiness just kept intensifying as the movie moved closer and closer to the full revealing of the girl's sociopathic state.By the final fifteen minutes, my sense of dread had piqued.This movie should be shown and discussed in all film classes. The topic: ""How to Construct an Effective Horror Film."""
2,boring.....,"I had read so many great reviews of this film, I ordered it. I must say I was very dissappointed. Yeah, the last twenty minutes are pretty cool but the first seventy-five almost put me to sleep. Don't wast your time or money....."
3,Needs The Cultural Context?,"This movie may tap into the Japanese male psychology, but to outsiders (or at least to me) it didn't really resonate. The idea of a female who tortures her male suitors promises some interest, but what you get here is disturbing violence that makes Stephen King's ""Misery"" look like a respite care ward. The first half of the movie is quite enjoyable and coherent. However, it becomes increasingly surrealistic towards the end with dream and reality becoming blurred. Overall, its compelling in parts, while bizarre in others. For me, this ends up as a confused and violent spectacle that loses much of its impact when viewed in the context of western culture."
3,Know the definition of Horror in Japanese term,"Sick of Jason's Friday 13th series? or Wes Craven's Scream? Or the creepy Dario Argento Italian Movie? It is time to learn what Japanese's meaning of horror.To me, Japanese horror is mostly not very graphical, and not much bloodshed, but it will chill you to the bone.Like this movie, I must admit the first 3/4 of the movie is really slow, but the uncomfortable, sick atmosphere just build along the movie. At the final final part, which is the most horrific scene, may churn your stomach upside down.Next choice: Ring the movie in Japanese version - a truly horror moive without a single drop of blood, but still can triple your heart beat.The reasons that I don't give a 5 stars for this movie - the female lead is actually quite ... ugly. And I think the ending can be more violent (I am a sicko!!)"
4,this movie is f-ing insane,"seriously... I mean... wow.it's a pretty good plot... well, it's okay I guess. The movie is basically an excuse to show a lot of disturbing images that will definitely make you say ""WTF?"". I'd say it's worth the buy. Yeah, you gotta read subtitles, but check it out. You'll dig it if you're a fan of suicide squad."
3,so-so,"I love Asian films, but this one was just so-so. Maybe I just expected too much...more than this movie could deliver. I had to watch it a second time to make sure I was right in my first assumption. It was okay, that's about all that can be said."
3,Decent Book,"The book is acceptable for learning Perl. The examples are straight-forward, but seems to intended for non-programmers. Beginning Perl is not the same as Beginning Programming Using Perl."
4,Good Tekkie Stuff,"I've yet to really dig into this book, but it looks very promising. So far I am not disappointed with my purchase."
3,A good introduction to improvised munitions.,"This book was of interest to me as it dealt with the subject of improvised munitions. This is of professional interest to me, as I am a military engineer. It is worth reading from this perspective. As a handbook of urban warfare, I am rather less enthusiastic. I know how to set an ambush, for instance, and at least one of the suggested ambush layouts would result in large scale casualties from friendly fire . . .By all means buy the book, but be aware of its limitations."
3,SIMPLE BUT DIRECT,"AS WITH THE OTHER REVIEWERS, I FIND THE URBAN WARFARE MANUAL TO BE SIMPLE IN NATURE. IN KEEPING WITH THE ""K.I.S.S."" PRINCIPLE, THE BOOK PROVIDES BASIC TACTICS THAT I FIND WORKABLE AND EFFECTIVE. AS A PROFFESSIONAL SOLDIER I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO OTHERS LIKE ME WHO ARE INTERESTED IN OTHER OPTIONS TO UTILIZE ON TODAY'S MODERN BATTLEFIELD. NOT A BIBLE BUT A GUIDE INSTEAD. SMALL AND EASY TO READ AND COMPREHEND. AS FAR AS THE OTHER REVIEWER'S COMPLAINT ABOUT HIGH CASUALTY TACTICS, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT ANYONE EMPLOYING THE TACTICS DISCRIBED IN THE MANUAL INVEST MORE TIME IN DISIPLINE AND INDIVIDUAL RESPONCIBILITY. WORTH THE COST."
5,"High-Quality, Sturdy Wood Blocks","My son received this set of blocks for his first birthday and they are by far the best gift we received. These blocks nestle together and can all be stored inside one giant block for easy clean up and storage. Unlike other block sets I've seen, I would consider this heirloom quality and is something we will keep for our children to pass onto their children. Provides unlimited opportunities for open play. Blocks can be stacked, nestled, sorted by size, sorted by color and used to build houses/castles/cities. Highly recommended. Although the description says for children age 3 and above, this set does not contain pieces that I would consider a chocking hazard."
2,Disappointed,Learned the hard way not to try to save $$ by buying no-name replacements! Sony battery charger does not even recognize the battery to indicate charge level nor indicates when fully charged. It is worth paying more for original replacemnet equipmemnt in my experience.
4,Lovely Cookbook,I enjoy this cookbook and trust the author without question. I know he has researched and determined the best of everything in the preparation of food. Wish I had it years ago when I had a family to cook for. I would definitely give it as a gift to young dedicated cooks.
2,The Yellow Farmhouse Cookbook,"The 2-star rating is because of the poor quality of the binding, not the contents. I own four cookbooks written by Christopher Kimball, and all are absolutely excellent - as far as the recipes are concerned. They are clearly written and utterly reliable. However, I now own two cookbooks written by Mr. Kimball which, although brand new, are showing signs of stress or have cracked at the spine almost immediately. Two by the same author is not an accident. The Yellow Farmhouse is one of them, the other being The Complete Book of Pasta and Noodles.Many reviews focus on the author's work, but the quality of publishers' workmanship also affects book purchases. This flaw in two of his books makes me hesitate to purchase more. There are many good cookbooks on the market. As a lover of books I consider spines that break to be unacceptable, particularly in a cookbook which, after all, is a reference meant to be opened many times."
1,I'm so disapointed,I have tried two recipes so far and they were both flops! I tried the baking powder biscuits and the buttermilk pancakes (with the whole milk variation). I really like Kimball and love America's Test Kitchen but I do not like this book.
3,It's okay,Nothing new or exciting here. The recipes are just so-so and Mr.Kimball will never make me believe that I am a part of his Vermont inner circle.
4,An excellent contemporary performance,"David Lloyd-Jones is carrying off his Bax Symphony cycle with panache. This is a committed, thoroughly competent performance of both 4th Symphony and Nympholet. Compared with a BBC Radio 3 performance of Nympholet years ago it is lighter, airier and more in character with the work's programme.It compares well with Bryden Thompson's 4th, one of Thompson's best renderings of a Bax Symphony, very worthy of consideration, though the recording acoustic is a little blurry.However, at Naxos prices, one can hardly go wrong with the Lloyd-Jones."
3,More than I really wanted to know about sheep,"I would have preferred more patterns and less information about the Morehouse Farm animals. If I wanted to know about sheep, I'd buy a book on sheep. The patterns themselves are nothing new or earth shattering.If you like to make cute mittens for children and the young at heart, there are at least 1/2 dozen in this book.Otherwise, not much to write home about, as my mother used to say."
1,doesn't work for me,"I have been knitting for 26 years and have never been so disappointed in knitting patterns as Morehouse Merino. I have tried no less than six of their patterns and kits using only their yarn, which does appear very attractive and soft, but their patterns just don't work for me. The instructions are very poor and when I called customer service when I finally got someone on the phone, they were not helpful. I fell like I have wasted my money. I have three of their patterns I just can't get myself to finish because they are just boring to knit. The two patterns I have finished, just don't fit - too small. The patterns are cute, and basic and the colors are very nice which is why I bought them originally, but regret that I did. I have moved on to something more challenging."
5,I love my cheap shoes!,"I wear these shoes casually, not for for training but I absolutely love them. They have a very classic look, go with everything, & are the most comfortable shoes I own. Plus you can't beat the price. Thanks, China!"
4,Great,This is a great buy! I bought them for a cheap pair of shoes to work in my garden/get dirty/etc. but have found myself wearing them all of the time. I wear a size 9.5-10 and a 40 is too snug to wear with socks.
3,"Beware the ""N"" word...","Musically, this is a great CD. Lots of great hooks. Lyrically.. well.. I have one major point of contention. There is liberal use of the ""N"" word. To the artist it stands for something.. he's made it into an acronym. Personally, I would not feel comfortable playing this CD in the presence of my culturally diverse church."
4,A staple of Christmas listening.,Best of Nutcracker the highlights. Listen to it every Christmas! It was so good to be able to get this version on line.
2,Not so cute,"I bought this for my son who loves Godzilla movies and begged for a Rodan ""snuggly"" for Christmas (he's 3). The photo is much better than it is in person. It's made out of a lightweight corduroy material, which is odd for a stuffed animal. To make his mouth open up, they obviously use some sort of card stock or light weight cardboard and you can feel it and hear it... it's just weird that they'd use that in a stuffed animal too. It's not really soft and plush and snuggly. And it doesn't really look as cool as it does in the photo. I'm disappointed in it and he doesn't seem to like it at all."
2,Disappointment,"I purchased this dresser for my daughter last year November and after 6 months, the drawer bottoms were falling apart. Spend a little more money for quality is my recommendation."
4,Good resource,"I haven't gotten all the way through the book, but so far it's a good resource. It addresses the different ways you can be depressed and helps you identify where you stand with it. Still, I don't think any book by itself is gonna solve your problems. You need a doctor you trust, too."
5,freedom from depression,"this book ,is going to be good for me. my pastor is giving us classes on depression,and i am so taking the classes."
2,Difficult to put together but it works.,"I read what others wrote about putting this together, but my husband is pretty good at jerry rigging stuff, so I said, what the heck. Yep, I definitely had to get his help and he had to jerry rig because it was missing stuff and was very tricky getting it together. Thats a shame, but otherwise, gotta say it does seem to work, the little I have used it, and its also true that it is not big enough to sit on the floor and use, unless for a dog or your sitting indian style. Putting it high on counter in bathroom makes it work. Some of the other reviews also mentioned difficulty at times getting it to stay and not move around, that is also true. I have a fairly light weight hair dryer/blower, so mine tends to stay a bit better, but does move some. I think you get what you pay for and I paid 14.99 so I can't say too much, it does do what it should, but yep, tricky getting it together and frankly it needs a more stable base and holder."
1,garbage,"Package came with missing screws, its just a waste, at least it was on sale but still money gone to garbage"
3,Hands-free,"The product works well, but is difficult and frustrating to assemble, as the screws and the holes are so tiny.Otherwise, it has many different angles of adjustment and does what it says it does!"
2,Lasted for 6 months,"My wife used this for six months.The adjustment portion is nice but it wore out. The parts inside the hair dryer stand are plastic.Eventually it became a low non-adjustable stand.Enjoy,"
1,Not worth it!,"This Item is not worth the money. I should've taken heed from the review I read. The vibration of the hairdryer causes the handle of the stand to move around in circles. Wouldn't buy this item for a friend, Sorry."
3,Could be better,"The assembly was somewhat simple but had a great struggle with the two main components. Once assembled, the stand would not adjust in height as advertised. It only stays at one setting. The stand does hold the hair dryer well, but would be better if it could be adjusted. I would not buy another one."
3,Falls over easily,I think this product would be much improved if the base were made much heavier. It falls over easily. I'm going to have to rig something up to hold the base down. It will be wonderfully handy if I can get this solved.
4,sturdy enough,"This is sturdy enough, but it didn't work for me. I do better getting the hair ready, turning dryer on, then off again and getting ready again. I guess if you use the stand you have to keep your dryer on, move off to the side so it doesn't screw up your wet hair - go back into the air flow. etc... I do like to store my dryer up on it as a pedastal instead of laying around."
1,awful,"This is basically a velcro loop on a stick, good luck getting it to hold anything in place, it kept coming undone or bending under the weight of the hairdryer itself. Useless."
3,Hair Dryer Stand,"The stand is too short to be on the floor. Other than that, it has nice strap and clamp and does its job as described."
4,very pleased,"purchased because wrist/hand in cast. Very easy to assemble. It worked great, just like I was using both hands. In fact when I went back to work my director asked how was I styling my hair with one hand. I laughed and said I typed in Hair Dryer Stand on Amazon, there it was. I am still using it even after my cast is off. I think this is a really great gift especially for girls with long hair."
4,Great product!,"This is such a clever idea. I purchased 2 for gifts and just ordered one more. Friends saw them and wondered where I got them. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the clip for the hair dryer is a bit funky. All plastic, not flexible, but fits most dryers. Can't be too heavy a dryer, though, which most aren't. I had an older holder, similar design, but with velcro strap to hold the hair dryer. That worked better and more flexible based on the dryer, but it's not available any more (go figure). This one works great for most dryers. I highly recommend it."
2,lousy,"this item its not worth a penny, it wont hold a stander dryer , its to bad I cant send it back throughout box"
1,A waste of Money,"This product is a waste of money.I ordered this product because I was having shoulder surgery and needed to dry my hair one handed.The item is very poor quality. The flexible hose is not strong enough to hold up the hairdryer. It continued to flip upside down. You cant adjust the height to your liking. Its either all the way up or all the way down.I made the mistake of throwing away the box, had I kept it I would have returned it. But I will just consider the 20.00 a lost investment."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"This is a great idea, but it is flimsy and cannot hold a dryer on its own. I have to lean it against the grooming table or it will fall over. Doesn't stand on it's own."
4,Stable for the most part. Satisfied with product.,"Hair dryer stand can be slightly flimsy at times, but holds up well enough. It serves its purpose and I am satisfied with it. It does save me from an arm and neck cramp everday which is always a plus!"
3,"Did the job, but wasn't what I had hoped it would be","I ordered the first one, it was missing parts. Couldn't figure out how to put it together and there were no instructions. Ordered a second one and it arrived with all the parts. It worked, but was not easy to adjust the height. So for me, had to get the height correct then leave it alone. Kind of defeated the purpose since I have long hair.I used it after shoulder surgery. Glad to have had it, but something wall mounted and easy to adjust probably would have worked better for me."
5,gives me an extra hand!,"I love this gadget. I never wanted to blow-dry my hair before because my hair is long and the process took forever, leaving me sweaty and with tired arms. Now I can blow-dry my hair quickly to sleek-and-shine perfection without all that hassle.I do wonder if they've made improvements to this in the past few months, because I had zero of the gripes that other reviews have had. It was easy to assemble (with my one confusion being that the two parts that raise/lower twist in the OPPOSITE direction than expected to tighten/loosen). The screws that people have complained about missing were in a little bag in with the instructions (although I do feel that this thing would stay together pretty well even without the screws). The clamp and velcro strap hold my 2.5 lb hair dryer securely--I've never had trouble with it falling or drooping. It goes very tall and very short--I've used it on my bathroom counter and sitting on the floor in front of the TV. I'm very happy with it!"
3,Hair Dryer Stand,"Holds the hair dryer great. Works for me. Problem with the stand. Does not adjust the way it should. 2 weeks after using, I tried to adjust a different height and it won't. Will only stay at its lowest height. I have on bathroom vanity. It works for me."
3,Hair Dryer stand,"A little flimsy - and my hair dryer is a bit heavy - but handy idea, I use it and let it brace carefully against the cabinet."
5,Great Product for the Price,"I bought this item based on the product reviews and it has been a very good product for the price. My item did not contain the screws needed to assemble the item, but once it was assembled it works great. I have a standard hair dryer and even on high it does not move around. Definitely would recommend this product to someone who is looking for a stand."
2,With a Power Drill and Some 2 Part Epoxy You Will Be Good To Go,"I am a firm believer that you get what you pay for. In this case, for $15.00 ($10.00 shipping), I was expecting a less-than-quality product that would probably work as advertised. In the end, that is what I had - though not before taking it apart, redesigning a poorly engineered bracket and ultimately gluing it all back together. But don't let me discourage you too much. At least it works."
4,HAIR DRYER STAND,"NEEDS A HAIR DRYER THAT HAS A LONG NOZZLE. IT DID WORK WITH MY WIFE'S HAIR DRYER THAT HAS A SHORTER NOZZLE, BUT TOOK A FEW MINUTES TO SECURE IT WELL. IT DID WORK AS INTENDED."
2,not all it's cracked up to be,bought this 2 weeks ago. the holder does not open wide enough to hold my hair dryer. is supplied with 2 small screws that are supposed to be used but do not fit into the wholes they were intended for. would return it but it's so heavy would be charged alot for shipping. didn't want to waste my money further.
1,"Consider your money sent to ""waste""","Got this as a x'mas gift for my daughter, The delivery was great , but as soon as it arrived. The packaging is old and you can tell it's been sitting on a shelf for a looong time, the assembly was easy but the product itself is really flimsy, it cannot hold the dryer in an upright position.It's really embarassing to give this as a gift. So I just said ""oh well"" I learned my lesson and go on."
4,Great Product terrible instructions,"Love the stand, it does exactly what I need. I bought it mainly for my Maltese's grooming. It takes both hands to comb him out and the stand holds the hairdryer right where I need it while I comb. Love it.The only bad thing is the terrible, terrible instructions but once you figure out how the poles go then its not too bad would definitely recommend the product just wish it came with better instructions."
5,hair dryer holder,"Great product that fills a need when you don't have the use of both hands, or even if you do!"
1,seemed like a great idea....,"This seems like a great idea, but because the stand does not have a brain and does not move, my head body is has to twist, bend and contort...or spend time adjusting the stand as you change areas your drying...which defeats the purpose of what its for! glad it didn't cost much."
2,Hair dryer stand,"The stand tips over easily with a decent hand held dryer. Concept was good, but just does not stay upright. Perhaps more info on the weight limit of a hair dryer would have helped me make a wiser decision. Unfortunately, I had ordered 2 of them to use in my dog kennels. Height is not high enough to be used on the floor and reach the dog on a grooming table. The more it is extended the easier it tips over."
2,"Helpful tool, clunky","The product is very helpful, but out of the box is wobbly and hard to install. We had some extra furniture pads that we used on the bottom to prevent the wobbling."
1,Stand,Loved the price and then found out how cheap this product is. Very disappointed in this product. It will not hold my hair dryer.
2,One needs a longer thinner barrel to their blowdryer than most to make this work.,"One needs a longer thinner barrel to their blowdryer than most to make this work. It takes a lot to set up; the screws are inadequate and don't screw in all the way; it remains steady, but it is sure light and doesn't give a lot of confidence in it's ability to hold a blow dryer. I barely made it fit and without the velcro strap all would be lost."
3,missing parts,"The box containing the stand arrived without the screws needed to put it together. i would rate it higher, as it actually works quite well....but the inconvenience of having to come up with our own specialty screws was a pain."
2,Not so sturdy,"This is the second hair dryer stand that I purchased. After about two years of almost daily use, the other stand broke where the plastic ""pincers"" hold the dryer. I thought I was buying the same thing, but my new stand is a lot less sturdy. The adjustable arm often flops down so the hair dryer isn't pointed the right way. The base seems flimsy too. Instead of moving the adjustable arm, I wiggle around so that the dryer is blowing on the right hair! Look for another maker--it will work better but may not last too long...."
2,Do not even use anymore,"This was a product that I was wanting to use for a long time and was happy to order it when my husband opened this account on amazon. I have very thick hair, so thick I cant even wear it in a pony tail because of hair band breakage and its about waist length so I have been wanting to try this for years. The truth is that I have used it about three times total and the reason why is because it cant really hold the hair dryer and I have bought another dryer that was light weight to see if it would work and it tipped over breaking the dryer. I find a dryer that would work and it was very small and low wattage and I couldn't use it on my hair without it burning up the dryer. I decided to use it on my daughters hair with the very small dryer and she has to move all around just so that it would reach her hair. I have it on my counter in the bathroom with a shower cap over it since I can find no other uses and didnt want the trouble of sending it back!"
5,Very helpful,Very steady gave as a gift! She loved it! Great for those two handed hair designs or for those that have a handicap and need a little assistance! Great product!
3,hands free hair dryer stand,I love having both hands free to style. I do have to be innovative to get the hair dryer to stay where I want it. My heavier one pulls the bendable part of the stand down. The smaller drier is easier.
2,Very disappointing,"I purchased this product really hoping for an anwer to my need with a torn rotator cuff. It assembled fine, but it does not stay in the top position. It slides down to the bottom position. I'm not using it now and am thinking of taping it in place with duct tape to see if that will help. I even tried different weights of hair dryers... all do the same thing. Looked good, but had to try for myself."
1,waste of money,Sorry to say this was a total waste of money. the holder portion broke after 2 minutes in my hand trying to figure out how it worked. Not the sellers fault but definately a major flaw by the manufacturer. You can tell it's just put together with some glue. So it's still sitting in the box. Maybe I will buy a different brand/style. If that doesn't work I might be able to put together one of my own making with the parts of both. Before I saw this one online I was actually thinking of designing my own & having my husband put it together but it was going to be of a more permanent style in my bathroom.
3,didn't live up to expectations,I purchased this book on recommendation in the Well Trained Mind as a great spelling program for homeschool use. I was disappointed with the layout of the lessons. Ended up re-selling this.
5,A good place to start spelling,"Philip Trocki carefully walks children through their first encounter with the nasty subject of English spelling. He begins by presenting just 6 words a lesson, carefully showing how phonics is really just the opposite side of the coin to spelling. It is an excellent companion reference for those who are beginning the road to reading."
4,Sometimes simple is good,"I purchased this program based on ""Well Trained Mind"" and when I looked through it I was surprised at how simple and easy it seems to be. There are about 7 words per lesson and they loosely follow a spelling pattern. I have decided to use this for the rest of the year and over the summer, but only because it won't overwhelm my son when I add 5 sight words each week to his spelling lists.I don't know how my son will like it,long tern but I can't imagine that a workbook by itself would complete an entire years spelling. I will look at something else for next year."
4,Good start for spelling,"My son likes this book a lot. It is pretty easy for him at this point--we're on week 9 and he's just now beginning to be a little challenged. It's a nice, gentle beginning text for spelling."
3,"Uncomfortable, hot and hard to get off","I was really excited to receive this item, Ive been power lifting the last 4 years, decided to get some of the best gloves I could find. First off I think the sizes run larger than other harbinger models. Even with the slightly larger gloves they are very difficult to get off my hands after a workout. I can put on my wraps and boxing gloves in the same amount of time. Im training in the Red Sea atm so I tested the breath-ability of the gloves and they failed. The cheaper models work just as well in my opinion and doesnt take so long to put on/off. Only reason Im rating a 3 is because the grip was slightly better than other brands/models."
4,Very good,"Very satisfied with the product. Padding on palms is great and really fulfills its purpose. Only flaw for me is when I'm doing pull-ups, that same padding can create problems with grip. But that is not really a flaw only a comment. Recommendation for purchase."
4,Long lasting and durable,"I bought this product in 2009 and lost 1 glove, without hesitation in 2010 I went ahead and got the same pair of gloves. It has been 2 years and for certain I have no regrets with my choice. Design an fit are perfect for my workout program. The only dislike for me is that the wrist wrap is a little long for my taste. Either way this glove has lasted this long and kept my hands well protected regardless of my workout program."
5,Great Glove,I have bought two pairs of these gloves. The first pair just started stinking too bad...but thats no fault of the glove and bound to happen on any glove like this. my logic now is that i buy a pair of gloves and expect them to last 6 months because i either loose them or they start smelling. These gloves are very comfortable and the wrist supports are perfect. I bench ~350 and military press 225 so i do use some heavy weight on them and they always feel comfortable.
4,not enough padding,I wanted some weight lifting gloves with wrist support. The hand part doesn't have enough padding should be thicker. I lift very heavy weights and the bar feels like it's right in my hand it self. I still recommend this glove.
5,Gym training gloves,This is my second pair of harbinger's. To me it is the Perfect fit and great wrist support. No complains.
4,Great working out gloves,"Very durable gloves. Great wrist support. I highly recommend them, I have been doing weight for the last 6 years and they are one of the best I have seen."
1,boo hiss,My work gloves work better than these. I feel like a FAME dancer reject with the fingers out. Cornball City!
3,There Good except for...,"These are good weight lifting gloves there pretty good on getting airflow to your hands as well. What problem I have had recently is the light fabric for the finger is way to cheap and fragile of a material. I have had my gloves for about 7 months now and everything else on them has stood the test of time, but the fabric around the middle finger part gave in and now has a hole and has worn thin. I lift 5 day a week just to give you an idea of how much use is put into them. Everytime time that I lift the dumbells they rub my finger raw and dry that my skin starts to crack now. Not a very comfortable feeling afterwards at all. I think that it is a good product but I just have a problem with the fabric around the fingers etc. I think that they could improve on that area, which would make this product superb."
3,gloves,"nice gloves, only thing i did not like is that they are really hard to take off, but overall good gloves to work out."
4,These are great!,"I work out personally about 4 to 5 times a week.These are my second Harbinger gloves I've bought. The first pair I bought three years ago are still going strong but they are a bit frayed from the usage.I personally like the WristWrap support. I do find my self having to re-adjust the straps every once in a while but it's really no hastle.I got a pair of large and they fit snug... almost a little too snug. However after two work out sessions they loosened up and feel like a good match.All in all I have to admit Harbinger make good work out gloves, that are durible and supportive."
4,An overall good product,"The gloves have a tight, solid feel, and are made of good materials. The manufacturer describes a new feature, ""Innovative curved finger design that offers a natural, flexible and comfortable fit"". That sounds good, but does not add any real comfort to the glove. You still have the excess padding when making a fist that makes it more difficult to grab the bar.Pros:Solid feel; good padding; good materials, overall design and craftsmanship; the ""No Sweat"" wicking system seems to work and there is no dark residue left on the hands after the workout, which is not the case with most manufacturers using cheaper materials.Cons:Excess inner padding affecting the grip; no ""easy-off"" feature offered by many other manufacturers; a wrist wrap that takes some tweaking to be comfortable."
3,Pleased not quite satisified...,"It seems as if the palms were sewn on backwards to the wrong hands, the seller probally had no way of telling. The product is still Quality, But I am concerned about long term performance now. I wold have returned the item at the shippers cost, but I did not notice until the end the work day. Fair is fair I would not want someone to send me back a pair of used sweaty gloves. Could be better...Still not bad..."
3,these gloves look great,"These gloves are comfortable and have alot of padding. The wrist-strap is thick and provides adequate support to the wrist. The only thing is that according to the sizing on Amazon I purchased a Medium but the gloves fit me kind of loose. This could be because they are not designed correctly or because the size might be big. I'm not sure. I like my gloves to fit snug so that I can do pull-ups withouth the burn on my hands from the pressure of my bodyweight. At the moment, I'm not sure if I should return these and get a size Small or if I should get another pair of Bionic. Besides that, the gloves look good, protect my hands and wrist but the fit is not the best."
4,Nice Gloves,At first when I started using them I wasn't a fan but I got use to them and now I do like them. They are much more bulky than most workout gloves I've used. I dunno if I would necessarily buy them again but they definitely are are a quality glove and the inner part is nicely cushioned.
1,BAD QUALITY GLOVES,I got these gloves as a gift in October of 2006 and started using them in November 2006. In September of 2007 with only 10 months of use they developed a hole by the seem where the thumb meets the palm of the hand. I used them 3 times a week on normal relatively new Olympic weight bars. Same usage with Valeo and they lasted me 3 years. When I contacted Harbinger they failed to respond to me basically telling me tough luck. I would STAY AWAY from their gloves since they don't last and they will not back them if they don't. YOU WILL LOSE MONEY ON THESE IF YOU BUY THEM!!!!!!
5,These are the Gloves you need for working out!,"No complaints. These gloves are perfect for working out. Even with light weights. Provides an excellent grip. Now for the heavy lifting, these gloves provide the best support and padding. I've used Harbinger before but so far these gloves excel expectations."
4,Feels great,"These gloves are by far the best I've ever owned. The gel takes up much of the pressure and the wrist straps are very comfortable. If you are looking for a new set of gloves, these are it. The gloves run a bit small so I had to order another set from Med to Lg. These gloves you can tell were built to last. Very well made and easy to clean. These gloves do not shrink like others I've had. But these and you won't be disappointed."
5,Love them..,They feel great. I love them. I use them all the time and they keep my hands from getting calluses.
3,Lifter,"These gloves are generally well constructed. The padding is more than adequate. The velcro strips are strong. Furthermore, the support of the overall glove and wraps is nice. So in general, these are good gloves. I do have large hands. However, the fingers are a bit short relative to the overall proportion of the gloves. My fingers are sometimes pinched or irritated at the finger termination of the gloves.It is not constant or really bad. But it is the negative I have on this glove."
5,Training Gloves,"I purchased these Gloves for my husband,he's very pleased with them ,he use them for weight lifting ,five days per week 3 hours per day ,so far they are holding up very well,so he gives them a five star."
1,Kind of Boring,I usually make up my own stuff and I don't like it too much. Sometimes it breaks and it's kind of boring.
1,SECOND SIGHT by Charles McCarry,"I had not read this author and I purchased two of his books, this one and Secret Lovers. I did not find them to be well written and had a few mispelled words in them.I would not recommend them or will I read another of his books as their are too many good authors' books to read.Peggy R. Wildman"
4,Would probably have liked it better if I had read earlier books in the series,"Second Sight was my first exposure to Charles McCarry. I thought the story line was creative, and the characters fully drawn and compelling. Great stuff here for fans of the spy novel, especially if you like the early days of the CIA right after WWII.But, as I was reading the book I could tell that there was a lot of history to these characters (and between these characters) that I was missing. The novel felt like a final good-bye to Paul Christopher and his compatriots. Only later did I fgure out that this was the last of the several Paul Christopher books. I will go back and read some of the earlier books in the series - and I recommend that you do too before reading Second Sight.If you are already familiar with the series, then I have no doubt you will find this book a very enjoyable conclusion."
3,McCarry pummels a dead horse,"The quality of McCarry's novels has declined over time.He still has the literary skills to turn a pretty phrase or make an emotional connection.But his characters have become 2-dimensional stereotypes, and his plots have become so absurd and implausible that it is hard to lose oneself in his work.His earlier work was his best."
5,Historical Feminist,"Victoria Holt always tells a good story. This novel is one of her best. Protagonist, Caroline Tressidor, a young Victorian woman, after having her heart broken twice, concludes that she would rather be independent than exploited for money by ambitious men.A remarkable woman for that era, Caroline is brave, independent, and highly romantic. Readers will enjoy the fascinating characters Victoria Holt has created here, starting with Caroline's vain, selfish mother. Toss in a conniving suitor who drops Caroline after discovering she is poor then marries her half-sister who is rich. Add a wealthy, eccentric aunt, a brooding love interest, and we have an enthralling story. Anyone who enjoys romantic suspense should love this one."
5,An Excellent Read,"Thirteen year old Caroline Tressidor is living a charmed life in Victorian London, but when exposes a a sercet she finds herself being shipping off to Cornwall to her Aunt Mary. While there she meet Paul and Jago Landover, brothers trying to save their home from being sold off. And from that moment Caroline's life will not be the same. From the wiles of Cornwall, to southern France back to London, Everything that Caroline knows will change.""The Landower Legacy"" is a great book by Victoria Holt. As always, Ms. Holt rich and interesting characters. Ms. Holt had a gift of drawning her readers in and never them go. A book by Victoria Holt can be enjoyed by readers of any age."
3,"Not the Best, but Still Pretty Good!","Upon learning she is illegitimate, Caroline's world is turned upside-down. She is treated different than her sister, she doesn't ""come-out"", and she goes to live with her aunt in Cornwall. As life progresses, she finds life is not what it seems.This is my least favorite Victoria Holt novel. It is a little on the boring side and without very much excitement. It is still very well written, like all of Victoria Holt's works. Just don't start here!"
3,A gothic romance which follows a Victoria Holt formula,"If you like Victoria Holt novels then you will enjoy this one although it is not one of her very best. The story is a little weak and follows a formula that was common especially to early Victoria Holt novels. The heroine marries for money and an estate, behavior which she eschews in others but is okay for her since she is in love with the landed hero. There are big country houses and a dark mine shaft suitable for someone to throw the heroine or one of the other female characters into."
2,[Two and a half out of Four] Not as good as the Skulls series but gets it's point across!,"Lokk also for Alexandra Robinson's finebooks on this and Skull and Bones YaleFraternity that has produced such lemonsas the Bush (Elder and Son) Presidents,Clinton, Gore and 'Pat' Robinson!"
5,Back to the Basics,Are You Dumb Enough is an excellent resource for brand new investors as well as experienced investors. It brings you back to the basics and reminds of you to stick to what works and not over complicate things. I was reminded of the techniques that had originally brought me success and was also able to pick up several new tips and tricks that have already helped increase our profitability.
5,Price should be higher!,"The price of this book should be higher with all of the info you'll be getting.Of course with all real estate books you should read more than just one so you'll have a better understanding of whats involved. I wouldn't expect to operate on someone if all I read was one book on surgery.You need to study and watch other people do it, and then when you're ready,you do it. Oh and the reason the other reviewer DANE S. FABER give it a bad review was because of what Mr. Barnett said in the book about real estate brokers, he called them Dinosaurs who have to to keep up with modern times. With all that said this is one Great Book! Read a copy at a library before you buy and believe me, you'll want your own."
2,Not fair!,"I have an average income, but, like many people, I have a burning desire to be more wealthy, so as to raise my social status above those around me. Books like this one seem designed for the purpose of informing people specifically how they could achieve this. However, although I'm no Einstein, it seems that this particular book's exclusionist nature may well leave me out. People like myself may only constitute a small market segment, but aren't we worth considering too? Why should I be excluded from the exciting wealth and investment opportunities referred to in this book? Perhaps the author would be wealthier from sales of their book if they had thought about this earlier."
5,"Outstanding, common sense approach to investing in real esta","I've read several ""real estate investment"" books over the years and this one is by far the easiest to comprehend and then implement! It has a step-by-step process for starting your real estate investment business and has some good humor spinkled in to make it an enjoyable read as well as informative. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in starting their own real estate investment business. Kudos to Mr. Barnett !!!"
2,Cover blurbs do not accurately reflect contents of book,"This is a history of packaging, not the psychology of packaging as I expected. Thus, I found it entertaining in places and terribly boring in others. If you are interested in packaging, from its origins to its impact on the environment, then this books does the trick. If you are fascinated in pop culture, then I would pass."
3,What's up with the icky cover?,"What can I say? As a book about packaging, it should take a lesson from itself. Sheesh...!"
4,Nice for the Price,"I shopped around before ordering this bag. It has a very nice look to it, professional in every way. There is plenty of room for your laptop, accessories, files etc. I would highly reccomend this for the business traveler. It is slightly on the heavy side for daily use, probably due to the rigid construction that provides protection around the laptop compartment; a fair trade off if you think about the protection afforded the laptop. If you travel, this is the bag for you."
5,Leather Briefcase,"I knew when I ordered the bag, from previous reviews, that the bag would not come the same color as advertised. Knowing that I went ahead and ordered the bag. As a college student I have to pack everything with me. I also have a 17"" wide screen laptop that has almost been impossible to find a case for that was not hugely expensive. I found this one on Amazon and decided to give it a shot. Excluding the color it is perfect. The color is a deep chocolate which I do like. The bag is well put togehter, the rivits go all the way through, most of the stiching is doulbe stiched, and all the clasps are metal not plastic.So far it has stood up to all the demands that I have put it though. And it gives me a professional look when I am out in the citiy working on my Veterans Culb."
5,"Not Only The Best Voice, But Also The Best Entertainer.","I am not Latin and I dont speak spanish, but I do like Salsa. The first time I heard Marc Anthony I was amazed because of his voice, his energy and his love for music. I have every CD and I listen to him all the time. There isn't another performer like him on stage, he is incredible and I cant wait to see him in concert next week."
4,Not perfect,It seems the mat selection for the Wii DDR is very limited. I purchased this mat so that a second player could play. Overall the mat works OK but I prefer the mat that came with the game to this one. My biggest complaint is that you can really feel the joints in the foam under the dance pad. It comes in sections so that it fits in the box and then you put it together. I need to try and put something between the mat and the foam to try and solve the problem.It is nice a cushioning under my feet. This really only matters if you play for very long periods of time. It also doesn't move around or bunch up. (We only have a slight problem with the other mat moving around but it's not a big deal.)Overall not worth the money for a second mat but not a bad product.
1,It doesn't work,"After playing with this device for a few hours, I have thus concluded that it won't charge. At first, the prongs were too far back to make connection to the battery. So I did what any nerd would do, I used a pair of needle-nosed pliers to pull the contact points out further. I thought that did it since the green light turned red to indicate that it was charging. So I left the battery plugged in for a couple of hours. When I cam back, the battery was still uncharged and the device had shut off. It's a nice design, but doesn't work."
2,attractive looking but ....,"These nailheads were attractive but the tip was not sharp enough so that a great amount of effort was needed to get into wood. Then in the process, heads kept breaking off. Would not recommend, look elsewhere."
3,Gets the job done.,"I'll start by saying that I've gotten many complements on these seat cover. People say that they look like a race car.However I was a bit disappointed with them myself. 1) They smelled disgusting for a couple of weeks after I installed them, probably because of the vinyl. 2) Only the top part is vinyl (the red stripe and the black inside of it), the bottom and back are a thin stretchy material like nylon or something. 3) The vinyl cracked within weeks of use. 4) In my car I don't usually have passengers, so the passenger side looks great, but the driver side cover is always needing to be adjusted and repositioned.But overall, they're ok seat covers.UPDATE: So it's been 9 months and it's time yet again to buy seat cover because these have tears in them. So these don't really last that long :("
4,Not crappy as others claim!,"Product was no where near what I was expecting - and thats a good thing! The seat covers were not super cheap, they did not smell like cheap plastic, and they fit fairly well. They were a little shorter than I needed but I made them work. I will agree that they do not have enough ways to fasten them onto the seats but so far they have stayed in place for the most part. I needed a cheap decent looking seat-cover, and I definitely got more than I expected~"
1,Not as described,"For my first order on Amazon, I ordered two of these items. They do not look anything like the picture in the description. I was hoping to have some really good looking covers, but in fact I received something I wouldn't even put on my lawn tractor. The packaging had the right part numbers, but still these items are misrepresented by the images. Very disappointed. If I didn't have to pay for return shipping I would return them."
5,From Back Cover,"A remarkable five -generation novel that begins with young Michael Devlin, hustled out of Ireland following an unpremeditated murder. He leaves with only the clothes on his back, his father's gold watch bearing a swastika on its case, and the searing memory of a kindly priest who had seemed transformed into a terrifying embodiment of an all-powerful god.In America, Michael will leave his job on the railroad to follow a band of Plains Indians through whom he will have a spiritual experience that reveals the Secret, though not its purpose.Michael's grandson will be tortured by visions whose source and meaning he cannot fathom.It is Michael's great grandson, who tempered by World War II and broadened by a career as a diplomat, guesses the awful meaning of the Secret.The resolution and its fulfillment will astound you."
4,good buy,The nets are great. Assembly is necessary and the net itself is a little difficult to attach but they serve the purpose and my son loves them. Good vendor...the product arrived quickly! Enjoy!
3,mike ladd is one abstract MC,"Mike Ladd has been in the hip hop game for years, but never like this. Welcome To The Afterfuture is what you get when Pink Floyd and hip hop unite. It is a new sound, so underground heads may not bounce to it, but you will soon. Mike Ladd is about five years ahead of his time. I am ready now!"
1,False Advertising!,"Photo is NOT of the product you will receive. The photo shows a bra with VW on the hood cover, I did NOT receive this bra, Lebra does NOT manufacture this bra. I have complained about this to the seller, seller blamed Amazon and said they would notify Amazon, however this photo is still be used. If you want the VW bra shown, do NOT buy it here, you will not receive a VW bra."
2,not what I expected,"In the photograph lebra show's a VW emblem stitched in white. It is not. Plastic retainer's keep stretching open. And even after being in the sun for two week's wrinkle's will not come out.If I would have saved packaging I would have sent it back.Being a Lebra I had the utmost confidence it whould be just what I wanted. I had a VW bra from Volkswagon for several year's but weathering had taken it's toll.This new Lebra doe's not look as good and will not last because of the plastic holders. Should have purchased one from VW again.Since Lebra has been around for so many year's I did not even doubt there would be any fit problem's or appearence problem's.Also in photo Lebra show's hood cover portion higher up on hood just like my old one' it only cover's hood at a v angle.The photo Lebra has look's identical to the one I had on the car before.It is not, and I am very dissapointed. The bra in the photograph is not what I recieved.BUMMER."
5,great,"excellent value, looked great on my house over 4th of July. Good value for the price. Used wrap ties to secure them to the railings of my home."
3,Clinique Repairwear Eye Cream,"This is an ""ok"" eye cream- nothing i would ever pay a lot of money for. Glad I tried it in a tester size first."
4,Works as designed.,"It looks good and works good. I wish the description included Antenna diameter at the base. It was too large for the housing I was replacing a lost antenna from so I had to carefully hand drilled the case out so this antenna would fit. For those who need this infromation, the antenna measures 6.75 inches collapsed, 37.75 fully extended. The base is just over .25 inches in diameter (6.86mm) and the top tip is larger at 10mm. The threaded bottem is appears to be a brass insert a little smaller than 6-32 (It is probably metric) and it screws right on to the top of my base station scanner with no problem once the case was drilled out to fit."
2,Light Porn,"I didn't watch very much of this movie.The movie starts off with the female star walking in rural are toward a house. She in completely naked except for the cap with her breast and very hairy vagina exposed. A man comes out of the house, they meet and then she leads him to what looks like a chicken coop where has oral sex and somehow drains his blood during the act. I didn't watch anymore of the movie. It's Bad!!!"
2,Faulty cap splits wont seal,"Dap must have changed the sealing cap on this product, because it splits open when you try to close the tube. I have brought this product years ago and had no problem with it, so I can only assume that they have gone to a cheaper cap rendering the sealant useless for future use because you can't get a tight seal. That is why I have only given this a two star rating."
1,Only one use - faulty cap renders contents unusable afterwards,If you get this the sealant works fine - but the cap is faulty - it splits open and so you don't get a second use out of the tube because it solidifies..
4,Great! except . . .,"Great Album, my only complaint is that Brad Mehldau's Paranoid Android failed to make the album (for whatever reason)."
3,"Hail To The Thieves! Well, Some Of Them","This really shouldn't work. Firstly, tribute albums are almost uniformly awful. Radiohead themselves are also not shy when it comes to having a crack at jazz or electronica, so why do we need others to push their finest moments into Gilles Peterson territory? Putting aside these preconceptions, Exit Music is an imperfect but rewarding listen, led by the fantastic novelty funk of Mark Ronson's Just. RJD2's Airbag sounds like Thom Yorke and co doing lunch with Aphex Twin, while Bilal's Sunday-morning soul version of High And Dry is the surprising highlight."
2,Extremely Disappointing - Save Your $,I bought this CD for the remix of Just by Mark Ronson and Alex Greenwald which I saw on Subterranean. I must say that they did an excellent job with their interpretation. The bulk of the rest of the album was a big let down however. I couldn't make it through most songs. Save your money and skip this one.
1,oh my,"it physically hurt me to listen to this poor excuse of an cover album, please for the love of god and radiohead, if u care about this planet dont buy this cd"
4,Great Throw-Back Movie,"This is a great throw-back movie. And I simply adore Bacall and Monroe together. Very funny movie. If you like Monroe, watch."
4,Love ASCP and this book is pre-hype so very helpful!,"Love Annie Sloan Chalk Paint and this book is pre-hype which means her tips and methods are more detailed and varied (decoupage, distressing, etc.). Later books probably focus solely on ASCP products while this gives you options outside of her personal line. I could really do without the ideas section -- some are great but many are just things I wouldn't do. But as far as the methods in the beginning, this book is WONDERFUL. Just keep an open mind and learn the techniques to apply in your own, creative way!"
2,Just okay,"If I had been able to peruse this book in a store I never would have bought it. While the pictures are very nice, I know I'll never actually do any of the things in it, so it was pretty much a total waste for me."
5,12 Great Indie Bands on one Album!,"This album features sixteen diverse tracks from 12 spectacular independent Christian bands from the East Coast! I love it! It never leaves my CD Changer! From ska to rock to punk to chick-pop, this album has something for everybody! Check it out - highly recommended!I especially like the following songs: ""Blinded"" (by Quick Fiction) and ""I Am Judas"" (by 5SS)."
1,Look at others,"Stories are too loud! Projection pictures fade away after a few months. Volume dial is useless after a few months. Nice idea, poor design."
3,Barbie Story Teller BAR805 Clock Radio with AM/FM Radio,"My daughter loves this product because it cast a light of different designs on the wall and tells stories, I purchased it as a refurbished item and when we plugged it in the numbers on the clock do not display correctly, it only shows half of the number. After several attempts to set the clock and unplugging it I still can not get it to show the time."
5,Simple and effective,"As managers, we work at top speed all the time and often we simply assume (and hope!) our employees are getting the job done. This book offers an easy to implement way to ENSURE employees are getting the job done. What a relief to have found this book. THANKS!"
5,Management By Objectives,"This is a short book on Management By Objectives (MBO). It covers goal setting, incentives, and follow up in a lot of detail but is still an easy read. If you need help coming up with well defined goals, this book provides a great set of questions that you can use to refine employee and department goals so that they are practical. The questions will speed your creation of goals.The book doesn't cover any other management topics."
4,Simplified Accountability,"With nearly everyone being asked to do more with less, performance accountability is more important than ever.I'm very fond of the ""SIMPLE"" approach prescribed in this book: ""Set expectations,"" ""Invite commitment,"" ""Measure results,"" ""Provide feedback,"" ""Link to consequences,"" ""Evaluate effectiveness."" This provides a smart protocol for helping employees be count-on-able."
3,Keeping Employees Accountable For Results,Direct and accurate information. Leaders will be encouraged to follow these on target suggestions for the best outcome for any employee situation.
3,Inexcusable Oversights,"As a long time Delorme Street Atlas user, I have always been bothered by the inability of the program to export route directions. The user has always been limited to a ""quick print"" in a small font that is extremely difficult to read. Thus, when the 2005 version boasted the ability to copy route directions to the user's clipboard, I was delighted. However, in actual use the feature has serious problems in that doesn't do a complete copy . . omitting at least one key column--distance traveled.Another issue is that the program doesn't remember view settings. Thus, if like me the user likes to have ""map center cross hair"" showing, it's necessary to set this up on each new map . . . very annoying, especially since previous editions remembered the setting.The shame is that these issues were brought to Delorme's attention early on, and could easily have been addressed with a service pack. Unfortunately, the company doesn't seem at all concerned with customers' complaints."
2,DATA NOT UP TO DATE,I travel on the road all the time and I use my GPS and laptop to find my way around. I would have to say that the software that comes with the Garmin GPS is a hundred times more accurate and useful.I have found that many of the roads in Street Atlas were labeled wrong or just plain drawn wrong. There is a lot of old information and not updated regularly. I live in a neighborhood that was built almost ten years ago and in Street Atlas 2004 it still didn't have my neighborhood in it and I live near a major city.I can't recommend this software for other than very basic information. You can get a paper map that will work better.
2,"Does the job, if you can get past the terrible interface","I was blown away by this product... in the sense that I could not imagine that such a well-functioning piece of software could be rendered virtually unusable by a horrendous interface. The controls are tiny, numerous, and often cryptic. To set up your GPS mouse, for instance, you would have to click the 'Exchange' button. Don't even think about using this product while driving, it is not suitable at all for a touch-screen display.Having said that, the maps themselves are accurate, and the programs packs a ton of useful information."
1,Terrible accuracy,"In some areas the software worked great, but in others it was off by hundreds of feet, showing me on totally different streets. Around my house it was consistently off by 800 feet and displayed my position one street away.This is not due to the GPS receiver. The receiver gives the right coordinate data. If you plot that data by hand on the map you will be positioned wrong. This indicates that the maps are not calibrated right.Tech support was worthless. All they tell you is that you can return it before 30 days. Of course, you're still out the tax and the cost of sending it back.Do not buy this product until they have fixed the maps. Consider yourself warned."
2,Difficult to Use,"As a real estate appraiser I travel from point to point and then write reports about each site. The GPS and voice functions are irrelevant, I never use them. The report writing function is where I need a program daily. And for my purposes, which is entirely for drawing, labeling and map notes for each site to be placed into a report, this program is an order of magnitude worse than the version it replaced. Lots of new features just complicate the program and make the simple features I need harder to replicate and work with. Sometimes the map will zoom or reduce unexpectedly due to a casual move of the pointer that was not intended to produce this effect. On balance, I hate it. The bright side ... you can find things with it, if you are willing to battle and fight the complex functions to do so."
2,Feature rich but with serious faults,"Findings after brief trial.Pros:1. Provide voice driving instructions, but those instructions may be confusing in some situations.2. Accept speech commands, it's quite fancy.Cons:1. It will ask you to turn left/right where you are not allowed to do so. This is quite dangerous.2. Some map informations are egregiously out of date.A road removed by freeway construction a decade ago still appears on the map, and i was asked to go through it.3. It doesn't locate my location precisely with GPS.It claimed that i was driving on a freeway when i was actually on a local road next to the freeway.I wonder how it can think this way as i didn't get into any freeway entrance. Can i simply JUMP into the freeway?MS Streets&Trips; didn't show this problem using the same GPS receiver."
2,Not for non-English users,"Street Atlas 2004 has a problem that if the version of Windows is not English or if the user sets languages other than English as their default language set on US version of Windows, SA 2004 does not work at all. So, I have to change the language setting of my US version of Windows XP and reboot the computer every time that I need to run SA 2005. It was so cumbersome and I wished that this problem is fixed in SA 2005. However, SA 2005 has the same problem and it seems like DeLorme does not care about this problem at all.If you are a user who uses different language setting on Windows, you should try Microsoft Streets & Trips instead of SA 2005. SA 2005 has better GPS capability than MS S & T, however, my choice is S & T for this reason.I gave 2 stars because it does a job sometimes when I don't mind rebooting my computer and giving up other jobs that need asian language support. I do this once or twice a year."
3,A major disappointment,"I upgraded from the 2004 version of this product expecting some feature and accuracy improvements, and have been greatly disappointed. The two sole assets of this product are its routing ability (including the ability to prefer or avoid certian road types) and the ability to export routes directly to a GPS unit.The disappointments, however, are significant. The routes exported to the GPS are off by over 200 feet in some places (in one case it was off by a half-mile!), resulting in my having to fix numerous incorrect turns. Also, the 2005 product does not have current maps (Microsoft Streets & Trips 2005 has far more accurate and current maps than this product and GPS integration, but cannot export to a GPS unit; but there are third-party utilities to handle this).If you are not using a GPS, this is a fair navigation tool, but I do not recommend it with a GPS in this area and prefer the Microsoft product much more."
4,first impressions,"I have a long commute and wanted to figure out which back roads were ideal.I was deciding between Microsoft's Streets and Trips 2005 and this program. I think the deciding factor was that the Delorme software has the ability for me to manually choose other roads besides the roads the program recommends.Microsoft's version doesn't seem to offer this. At least they don't mention it. By allowing me to choose my own roads, I can avoid rush hour roads that are not ideal even though they are the calculated ones.It may not have as many POIs, but I was more interested in customizing and alterning suggested routes than points of interest. That feature alone made the Delorme worth it for me."
3,Inaccuracies of no concern to publisher,"If, and it is a big IF, you never encounter any inaccuracies with this product, it is an acceptable product. On the other hand, if you encounter one, and you contact the publisher about it, expect to be ignored. In my case, I attempted to route a trip from Tok, AK to Destruction Bay, CAN. I was routed many miles in a round about fashion. I tried to use the Draw function to introduce the most direct route but that failed also. The response from Tech Support was that I could return it for a refund if I had owned it 30 days or less. So, buyer beware!"
2,Poor Northern Virginia Data,"I have used Delorme products for a number of years and love the features. The 2005 Street Atlas is a little slow to start, but still nice to work with.BUT!!! they seem to have spent their time on ""features"" and not updating the database. I live in Northern Virginia and was very disapointed with this release.Street Atlas 2005 is headed for Ebay and I cringed as I installed*#**#."
5,A business story with humor and heart,"This is an absolutely enjoyable, quirkly read. I'd recommend it to anyone who's ever fantasized about turning an interesting idea into a concrete business. The authors detail the ups and downs of their venture with refreshing honesty and lucid perspective that thankfully lacks the imperious attitude you find in some of the dot-com memoirs. I can't think of a better gift for business grads or entrepreneurial dreamers, young and old."
5,Breathtaking and Wonderous,"What can I say about this book? Simply put- funny, insightful and a fine work for first-time authors Lusk and Harrison. I was recommended this book by a friend and was reluctant to read another business book by know-it-all MBAs. However, I was spellbound by the candor and humility of starting a business in the midst of Internet mania.I highly recommend this book and if one thinks working out of a kitchen and getting pushed around by large department stores is glamorous, read on! Should be mandatory reading for all those thinking about leaving their jobs for the glamour of a start-up."
5,All American Passion for Entrepreneurers,"As a long time follower of MouseDriver and the ""Insider"" I have enjoyed watching their journey. These guys represent all that is passionate about being an entreprenuer. I identified with this book and their extreme passion to build a business. These guys and this book are one of a kind.This book takes you right into thier lives and gives you the closest sense of chasing a business dream. This book made me laugh and cringe all at the same time. Ultimately this book is about what you didn't learn in business school. Great read, well written, great story! ""I'm In!"""
3,Startup with a real product,"This book is interesting since it is about a startup with a real product. There are many books about dot com startups, but the two authors of this book had a real product they based their product on. The product was simply a mouse shaped like a golf club. It was not a world changing product. But we see the problems of manufacturing and distributing a real product. Some of this can be a little less than exciting, but overall it is fairly interesting. My biggest problem is that it seemed like the authors should have waited another year to write the book so we could know the fate of the mouse driver and their company."
4,An unexpected enjoyable truip,I was in a book store and I was attracted to the title and the cover color. I picked up the book and read the jacket and I was hooked. I hardly ever buy non-technical books -especially non-fiction. But I was hooked after reading the jacket so I bought the book and assiduously read and enjoyed it. Also I am a Wharton alumnus. I also took classes with Len Lodish.Eric Ericsson
3,Interesting...for a while,"Its worth a read if not only to gain perspective on how difficult and challenging a start up can be. Plus it was nice to see that they stuck their original philosophy and idea.But then they run out of gas, and in turn, the book out of pages - no product advancements, branching out or new insight, leaving the reader wondering how the story ends.Fortunately, because they leveraged the internet and have a newsletter, you can go to their website to find out. I checked, and in short, they're in limbo & not sure what to do next.Believe me, I give them all the credit for trying and succeeding at what they did, but it appears that going to Wharton to get an MBA and then having the guts to follow an idea doesn't save anyone from the real world."
4,A Good Read,"I am currently studying for me MBA at Saint Louis University, and one of the classes I am taking assigned that we read this book. I was surprised at how cadid and funny it was. The experience of reading The Mouse Driver Chronicles has changed the way I look at entrepreneurship. Being an aspiring entrepreneur myself, I learned more from this book than I could from any classroom."
3,The Mouse Driver Chronicles - Lusk & Harrison,"This book made me smile. Written by two entrepreneurs who were working in their first business start-up, the book chronicles their first year in business, and all of the things that they learned at Wharton that ultimately was totally useless. I have used this book in some of the MBA classes in which I teach, not because I think an MBA is useless, but because I do feel that some of the information taught in textbooks is incredibly irrelevant when it comes to running a real business. This book points out the highs and lows of a new business, and I recommend this book often for people who are in their first start-up. A quick, enjoyable read."
4,good book,"If you are considering entering into a products business, this is a great book to read. The stories of these guys' trials and tribulations are something all entrepreneurs should read. They reveal the importance of understanding that failures will happen and you will need to keep going."
3,Nice but...,They look really nice but if you're going to use them for walking a block forget it; I got blisters on my toes.
4,Kenneth Cole sandels,Very cute and stylish. Not very comfortable on sides of toes if walking or standing alot
2,"Beware, blisters!","I just received them yesterday, and tonight decided to wear them for the first time to the movie theater, so I was not walking or on my feet for a long time. But they were hurting me the whole time and I got them 1/2 size bigger. It's a shame because they are very cute, maybe the leather will get softer with wear, but I don't think I'm going to go through the blisters until it gets soft."
4,Good book,"Discovered this book while searching for a topic on enslavement to alcohol. The quote was written in such a heart-wrenching manner, which drew a despairing picture of how an alcoholic is truly trapped and driven to go where he does not wish to go. So I ordered the book, which is a small book in dimensions, and covers the mysteries of life in a concise but deep manner."
2,What happens when you don't read previous reviews,"Paul Oakenfold!! AND Normam Cook!! Twice the excitement right?!Wrong.This is a sample box for DJs. Funny how accurate the name is. If you're not a DJ or producer, this probably isn't for you. Actually, even if you were a DJ or producer, is this really how you'd get samples?Surely not.Poor. I really think Oakenfold and Cook are taking this piss with this release."
1,I can't believe Oakenfold would put his name on this.,"The title should be a clue. This album is nothing but individual samples played over and over again to a drum loop. I'm not a newcomer to electronic music, and I understand that repetitive themes surrounded by creative variation is par for the course. That's not what this is. It sounds like he spent about 15 minutes on each track. He literally takes a single melodic loop and repeats it over and over and over again on top of a single drum loop. All the tracks are like this. There is NOTHING TO THE PRODUCTION. After being spoiled with Creamfields, Great Wall, The Club, Tranceport, and Bunkka, I expect some world class production. This is not it. I can't believe Oakenfold would put his name on this. In fact, I can't even believe this is Paul Oakenfold, it is so mindlessly bad. I'm a little mad at Oakenfold, I must say, for robbing me of $14."
3,Mean Season,"Leanne Gitlin has loved Josh Reed since he was a doctor on General Hospital. Now that he's moved on to bigger and better things, she still loves him from afar, but it's about to get a lot closer. While shooting a Civil War epic in her hometown, Josh is arrested for DWI, and placed under house arrest, hers, for ninety days. While things are less than ideal, including Josh, especially his language, Leanne is allowed to get a bit of her dreams. After a heartbreaking moment though, the time to choose between dreams and reality will come.**** Though it did't go quite in the direction I hoped for, Mean Season is above average on the Chick Lit meter. It belongs on the shelf of someone who enjoyed books such as Where the Heart Is or movies like Win a Date with Tad Hamilton. It's not all fun, there is a truly tragic scene, but then again, what is all fun? ****Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
5,A warm bath of a novel...,"The author poured a lot of herself into this work, giving us all the perfect gift of an intelligent, personal and bittersweet story...Enjoy the read."
2,Why do I do this to myself?,"I have tried and tried to read books of this nature. Folksy, heart warming tales of love and happy endings.The writing of this book was good, the plot and the characterization fell short for me. The protagonist was far too naive to belong in this day and age. Really? She knew absolutely no one with a cell phone?If you want off the wall plot and stereotyped southern charm, this is a book for you."
4,Best summer reading in a while,"I had planned on reading just a bit of this on a Saturday before getting some work done. After a couple chapters I ended up changing my mind and indulging in a lovely afternoon of reading. Aaaaah, such a treat."
1,Mean Season,"This wasn't the worst book I ever read. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I guess I should thank that part of myself that feels defeated when I don't finish a book, because it actually was worth slogging through the vapid beginning. That said, I won't reread Mean Season. I found it predictable and generally uninteresting. Heather Cochran seems to think in terms of stereotypes."
5,Bravo,"Loved it. The first third of the book moved slowly and I began to wonder if I wanted to finish it, but I was richly rewarded for sticking with it. Leanne is one of the most incredibly believable female characters I've encountered in recent reading. Although the movie-star-in-the-house plotline is initially easy to dismiss with a roll of the eyes, Cochran works with it deftly and produces a superb novel as she winds Josh's story into that of the Gitlin family. The dramatic wallop that occurs shortly before the end is wrenching and definitely lifts this book out of the category of simple ""chick lit."" I applaud Red Dress Ink for continuing to publish fine, thoughtful writing that treats the complexities of young women's lives seriously and skillfully. I look forward to reading more of Heather Cochran's work."
4,"Touching story, and a super-fast read!","This story was deeper-feeling than your usual chick-lit. I really enjoyed it, even though the circumstances of the story were far-fetched. I read this in 3 days, and was sad when it was over. Definitely recommend!"
4,Chic Lit Without The Fuss,"From the first chapter I felt a directness to Cochrane's style unmatched by her peers currently. Her 'heroine' purports the same quality: ""a take me as I am"" minus brashness or attitude very common in romantic fiction/humour writing right now. Story line is just a little left of center, which entertained me very much: president of soap stars' fan club, after years of effort manipulated by the L. A. entourage finds herself enabling said star with her family, friends and home, across the country from the bright lights. Believable, satisfying read. I hope Heather writes more."
4,"I'm old, but I'm happy about Mean Season","I'm happy, at age 62, to find a new kind of book to enjoy in the hammock and my big chair. MEAN SEASON, by the delightful Heather Cochran, in it's sweetness, reminds me of my crushes on Jimmy Dean and Marlon Brando in the 50's. They too were 'bad boys'. I find that the new language, the new awareness of family relationships, and the new sensibility of honest hopeful young fiction hooks me in as did the Catcher in the Rye when I was 22.Thanks to Red Dress Ink!"
3,Hard Boiled Private Eye -- Half Baked Plots,"Philip Marlowe is a tough talking, hard fisted private eye who wisecracks and punches his way through eighteen adventures in crime and detection. The characters frequently engage in illogical behavior prompted by inadequate motivation, and Marlowe manages to get himself knocked out at least one time per story. By the eighteen episode I began to suspect that some of Marlowe's more inexplicable actions could be attributed to brain damage. If you put your mind in neutral and simply let the stories carry you along, ""Philip Marlowe"" can be quite entertaining."
4,Great Bible - Lousy pricing policy from Amazon,"This is a great Bible! The Life Application bibles are great for most people who want to dig a little deeper and well, apply the Bible to their lives. The NLT 2nd edition is a fantastic translation.I would have given this 5 stars, but Amazon is charging $69.99. While that is the correct list price, the Bible came with a huge sticker on it that said $49.99. I felt a little ripped off."
4,Love this bible!,This bible has been very easy to read and understand. I actually enjoy reading the bible now. Also has lots of extra information.
5,Packaging,"The Bible is great, but I had a hard time visualizing the book from the on-line picture and description. The book is tan and brown. The picture on the website is attempting to depict what the Bible looks like. The square with the two tones of brown is actually a window into the box. The green area is the box holding the Bible."
4,Truly Understandable,I was looking for a bible that would be easy to understand. This bible was everything I was looking for. The way it is written makes it very easy to understand and the sub-text and general outlines are fantastic. I find it to be one of the best study bibles on the market. I only wish it was issued in larger print.
5,Great way to find the wisdom you need in life,"This is an excellent Bible filled with tons of tools to help a person apply Biblical wisdom and insight to their lives.This New Living Translation gives you a version that is in today's language.I highly recommend this to anyone that wants to get a better understanding of History of the world, as written by God."
5,Bible for study,This is a wonderful Bible for my study class. AND the price was THE BEST anywhere. Fast shipping arriving before expected Amazon is a great place to find what I need.
4,More Than Just One Hit Wonders,"Agreed, BMG certainly did not provide the care in presenting a remastered reissue, not to mention the total lack of historic liner notes, leaving any first time listner clueless as to the orgins and basic facts of this very underated sixties group. However, at a bargin list price ..., you do get two entire unedited albums and two of their best I might add. The Youngbloods scored a major hit with Get Together in '67, however they never cracked the top fourty again. It wasn't due to a lack of effort nor songwriting talent. Whatever the reasons there are some great songs here including the beautiful Sunlight, Ride The Wind and Quicksand. Like so many other great and talented bands of that era, Buffalo Springfield, The Flying Burito Brothers, Moby Grape and others, they'll most likely be remembered as one hit wonders. Truth be told, they were so much more than just ""Get Together"". This fine collection is evidence of that."
2,No Regency there,"Its a mystery. Indeed. But as for the flavor of the regency, there is none. You could do this in any era. And then our hero... He is so conflicted and problem riddled, sympathy is certainly the reader will not give him.Stephanie Barron and her Jane Austen mysteries give much more regency flavor. And the heroine certainly is not conflicted beyond ones belief that they will ever want to rise from bed..."
2,"Captain ""Meh""","I'm quite partial to historical mysteries/romances, but this left a fair bit to be desired. It's not that it's terribly written, it's just a little boring. . And it had a good enough basis to make a hearty mystery, however I found myself skimming through the historical descriptions and the characters, particularly Captain Lacey, were just too unengaging to carry it off. I found I had nothing invested in any of the characters and was a little glad when it came to the end."
5,Excellent Introduction to a series,"This was one of those $.99 cent purchases that I hoped would be at least mildly interesting and boy was I surprised! It is a very well-written book, more mystery than love story. It reminded me of a P. D. James book only set in Regency England. If you are looking for a standard bodice-ripper, this won't make you happy, but I highly recommend it for those liking a moody mystery that keeps you guessing at least until 3/4's of the way through the book.Both the hero and the supporting characters were interesting and I hope that they will continue to develop in the coming books. As soon as I finished this one, I ordered the next, so I am hoping for another good read."
3,an OK period mystery,"I am a big fan of Anne Perry's Thomas Pitt series, so I like the period London setting. I think they unfold pretty well and the plots are decent. I found that the main character, Lacey is a bit of a downer. He suffers from Melancholia. I read the first three hoping that I'd found a new series to enjoy, but I think 3 was plenty for me. It also seemed a requirement that Lacey had a romance of some kind in each story that got to be a little predictable. Not a bad read; give one a try and see what you think."
3,Fun easy beach read,This book is not comparable to a Sax Rohmer or Will Thomas novel but it is an easy book to get into. A light read with intrigue and good background settings. A fun read for a relaxing day at the beach .
2,simply not engaging,when you have read CS Harris this is very bland fare indeed. By the end of the book I still didn't care about the fate of the good Captain. There are much better writers of this genre out there.
2,Just So So,"Love Victorian novels but this one was a disappointment. Finished it only to find out ""who dunnit it!"" Not much excitement. In the beginning it caught my attention, however, as it went along it began to drag."
2,You get what you pay for!,I bought this Eureka The Boss Lite Vacuum about a year ago for [money] and am are now buying another (more expensive) vacuum. I can no longer stand the extremely loud deafening noise this vacuum cleaner makes when it is on and refuse to clean with it any longer. It actually wasn't that bad when I first bought it but after a few months the noise actually got louder and louder. The only reason I didn't give this vacuum cleaner one star was because it does do the job and has a fairly strong suction power. But don't buy this vacuum unless you plan to throw it away after a few months!
5,"GREAT Vac, 6.5 years old and going strong","My wife brought this vac home from where she worked, where it was used every single day. When the school had a central system installed they had no use for the portable vacs and she grabbed this one. We have had it 5 years and it is used almost daily as we have shedding animals. Aside from bags this vacuum has coast us nothing and it does a great job in picking up pet hair from all carpeted or fabric surfaces.If I had one complaint it would be there is no way to shut down the brush so it can be used on hardwood floors. Otherwise a truly great vacuum which works as well as ones costing 3 and 4 times the price.As for the complaints about the noise? We have a $500 Panasonic canister that is just about as noisy. Suck it up people, it's a VACUUM cleaner after all. Stuff cotton in your ears and get to work."
2,"Spend more, get a better vacuum","A cheap vacuum. Spend more and get a better quality vacuum that will last longer. This one is awkward, cumbersome, and loud. It cleans decently after you adjust the high-low knob according to the floor/carpet you have, but there are better vacuums around.Mine lasted over a year, but now I have the same problem as others who posted here. I think the motor is shot. Now, it shakes, is LOUD, and smells like something is burning."
1,Not up to standard by a Long Shot,"Very Very Disappointed, despite the comments from the Author, Preface & Publisher & the Delay in the Book Coming Out. Heaps of Information Esp in the Management arena & The References are grossly outdated (for instance it still quotes Braddom Textbook 1996 edition, PMR Secrets 1997 Edition, both having second editions (2000, 2002 respectively). Also eg: Facts on HRT are outdated. Way Too Expensive for Such a standard of text published. Should have costs less than 1/3 the retail price !It deserves less than 1 star given the above negative points !"
1,I huge let down!,Dispite what the author and publisher may say Don't waste your money. Take one of the Board review courses. This book was just not that good. Brammer and Spires Manual of PMR was even better than this thing and cheaper.
4,enjoyable,"This was interesting for both me and my sweetheart. she knew Katy Perry's music well, but found this an interesting and enjoyable experience. Katy Perry was pretty new to me, but I liked what I say and found the whole show well done and both fun and worthwhile to watch."
3,Where's the special feature?,"I bought the 3 disc bluray combo.The movie was great.But i can't find the bonus/special feature as written in the 2D Bluray disc.All content is same,all of them are movie presentation in different disc only.Anybody can help me?Thx"
4,I loved it!,Very inspirational! I was very much entertained and impressed. I was surprised to see how hard she worked. Katy Perry is the WOMAN!!!
4,"Love Katy Perry, this is a must watch!!","I love Katy Perry and enjoyeds watching this biography, but wish they would have included her full concert as well."
4,movie was surprisingly entertaining,"this movie was surprisingly entertaining and lacked the more inappropriate edge I feared it would have. There are a few words here and there, but nothing extreme. Appropriate for tweens/teens."
5,very enjoyable,This was purchased as a gift for nephew-a Katy Perry fan to the max. He stated it was very enjoyable and well done. He hopes Katy makes another movie in the future.
4,Surprisingly good,This was better than I anticipated. She is quite the artist. Great story with a look behind the scenes of a singer song writer.
4,My 13yr old loves it!,"I thought it would be more like a movie than a documentary, i still liked it and my 13yr old loved it."
2,katy p,the movie was very slow and boring. It froze 3/4 of the way into the movie and we never saw the end. The Justin Bieber movie was much better.
3,This Is What Zombie Movies Were Warning Us About,"You may ask ""What's so different about this movement than Beatlemania, Glam rock of 1972, or the New Romantic British Synthpop of 1982?"" It's all centered around one person, whose lyrics have very little depth, randomness, or awareness of the complex world. I admit some of her melodies are catchy, but they're all spoiled by a vocal or drum that pierces the other sounds. Not since Michael Jackson's death has such an unhealthy all consuming lifestyle been built around a celebrity."
4,"sad , inspiring and just plain fun","Katy Perry' s docu concert movie Part of me . Is a mix between her california girls tour and her life through that year. The performances are bright and fun ( wish I'd of gone to the show I originally had ticket but couldnt go, regret that , next tour def going ) . Her sruggles early on with record companies and her religious background were interestiong to learn about. She really worked her but off to get what she has , It wasnt overnight like it seemed. Her life rerlationship struggles are the sad part of the film. Her marriage falling apart midtour is heatbreaking watching her talk about it. Overall the film is a nice balanced mix, one you could watched over and over again. I was already a KATY fan , owning her albums and her purfumes , but after seeing a part of me I love her even more. With holidays coming its a great gift choice for any Katy fan or someone just starting to like her .."
5,GREAT MOVIE!,Great movie and fun for the whole family. There are so many ups and downs. It shows so much of her life and I definitely recommend it! Katy is such an inspiration!
3,i dont have the bonus,"The movie its great i bought the 3d limited edition but i dont have the bonus i dont know why, the menu its only for play the movie, scenes ans settngs, thats sucks"
1,Waste Of Film,"This is a waste of film , time and money put together on this.Wouldn't surprise me if I see this dvd at the dollar store."
2,A raging narcissist,"Look, I know if you are a ""fan"" of Katy Perry and the image she projects, you'll think this ""movie"" is Citizen Kane. Me, being a Seventies and Eighties kind of guy, I actually like several of her songs, and she doesn't look too bad on stage. However, she isn't John Lennon, Bob Dylan or even Madonna; she just isn't that interesting outside the music. All I want is a full-blown concert video without all the ""part of me"" stuff. This is the third DVD she has released that is mostly about her life, her fans and what people say about her. She's had one decent album and a half-dozen hits to her credit, and that warrants all of this??? I don't want to know Perry the narcissist, I just want to see a dern concert film."
3,My girl rented this,"I didn't watch this,not for me, but my girl really enjoyed it. She has good taste in movies so I will have to say it was good for those who like Katy Perry."
5,Wow!,This movie provided interesting insight into Katy Perry & helped me respect her and her music even more. Highly recommend!
5,Not for me.,"Got it for my dtr-in-law for Christmas, she loves it. She and our son watched it the other night again she said."
4,Christmas excitement,My daughter was very excited to get this movie for Christmas. I saw it with her in the theater and was very pleasantly surprised!
5,Great Movie,This movie was fun to watch especially because the music was great and Katy has the most amazing and creative costumes!
4,"Went to see if for my daughter, stayed because of myself...","I went to see this with my daughter and my sister because although I am not a ""die hard"" Katy Kat, I do appreciate what a great and powerful influence she is on girls today and Im not gonna lie, I really like her music. Its one of the few times you dont have to take everything so seriously and just be SILLY!That being said, this movie made me cry, laugh, sing and feel what Ms Perry felt in her heartbreaks. She shows what acceptance and determination really can accomplish in a very open and honest way.I left that movie not only with a whole new respect for her as an artist and role model but it made me proud to be a woman/mother showing my daughter that it really does pay off to be yourself no matter WHAT ANYONE TELLS YOU!!two thumbs WAY up!"

1,Digital copy download won't work on Mac; no paramount support,I am giving the DVD 1 star as a reflection of Paramount and not for the quality of the film itself. I ordered this edition specifically for the digital copy and have not been able to download it. I have Silverlight installed but when I try to download it from the Paramount site I get nothing but a blank pop-up box. I tried contacting Paramount support twice and no response at all. Save your money. Very unhappy.
5,Katy cat fan,I recommend this movie for all Katy cat fans! She is a beautiful person inside and out. This movie shows the sacrifices she has had to make to get where she is today. This movie is really fun to watch and colorful.
2,Eh,"My wife and I felt more sad for her as we watched this behind the scenes view of her tour and the songs that she sang on stage. If you're a big KP fan, then maybe you will like it a lot more."
4,"Was not expecting much, but it was really good!","I like Katy Perry's music, it is catchy and fun. However, I was pretty surprised to see someone who is so new on the music scene making a feature film about their career. But we were looking for something to watch the other night and this was one of the options, and my daughter picked it. I ended up really liking the movie! Katy Perry comes across as very down to earth and quirky, which is certainly someone I would rather my Daughter look up to than a Brittney Spears! She is talented, hardworking and really makes an effort for her fans and family which was nice to see. I recommend it!"
2,Who cares?,"Back Cover description: They met at the airport. He wore a suit and carried a briefcase. He seemed quiet, a little shy. Definitely not the type to flirt with a fellow passenger&#65533;even if she was famous actress Rosalind Marlow! His name, Roz discovered, was Luke James. She was determined to discover more about him&#65533;such as why he appeared to following her. And was he as innocent as he seemed? What he really needed was a lesson in flirtation&#65533;and, on impulse, Roz decided to be his teacher! Luke was a fast learner. In fact, Roz soon discovered that he didn&#65533;t need lessons at all. He could teach her plenty about the art of seduction!Not one of Ms. Napier&#65533;s better books. I didn&#65533;t like Roz or Luke. The plot was unbelievable and some of the things Roz did, when she knew the press was always after her were just stupid. Read THE REVENGE AFFAIR instead"
5,Fragments are best,"Lawrence wrote two kinds of poetry as he wrote two kinds of Literature. One is alive, spontaneous , reacts to and connects with external reality, even brings that reality alive through sympathetic identification with it. The second kind of poetry is dogmatic, one- dimensional, opinionizing and comes at us without complexity. It is the preaching poetry.The best poetry of Lawrence is that which flows and is fused with a kind of ongoing passion, and feeling."
4,speedy,The shipping time was great for this book. It came in just in time for my classes even through I ordered only days before. The cover of the book was in fine condition and the pages all looked great.
2,classical music reference book marred by sloppy packaging by amazon.com,"I have purchased many books from various sellers using amazon.com as an agent, and all have been spot on. This is the first time I have purchased a new book actually from amazon.com itself.. and I was appalled to discover that sloppy packing had dogeared about 50 pages of the book, which was a Christmas present from me to my daughter..I am thinking I will never give Amazon the chance to repeat this ""service"", but continue to use amazon as only an agent for other more reliable sellers, who value their customers enough to ensure that they receive always the most meticulous service."
3,merely okay,"I had some slight expectations from this record, and they were not quite met. The entire album is simply messy, and intentionally so. There are melodies in here, and the loud, garish production (see Sleater-Kinney's ""The Woods"") is very well done and interesting, but I never feel like returning to it.I'm not a fan of those who annoyingly whine for the past. In this case, it'd be someone pining for the ""Featuring 'Birds'"" era, a return to more obvious melodies and cleaner production, better lyrcism (the lyrics on ""When the Going.."" are occasionally embarrassing) and a more acidic sense of humor.However, I would be lying if I claimed to not share those same feelings. ""When the Going Gets Dark"" is a good album, but nothing special, and not the greatest sign for those who liked the band before ""Hot S***."" It's more obvious than ever that the glory days are well over."
1,Just when you thought they hit rock bottom..,"Here is a band that ran out of steam 5 years ago. The only 2 albums of theirs worth getting is ""Featuring Birds"" and ""Field Studies"". At least those albums featured catchy melodies. When I thought they reached their nadir with their last album (whose title was relatively apt), they plunge deeper into the abyss. Sam Coomes ""vocals"" come across way too annoying and whiney and smug. At least this time around, vitriolic Coomes isn't crying about the current administration nearly as much as he did in the recent past."
3,Inca Wonderland,"I bought this book mainly because it was supposed to be up to date. Some of the information (most notably internet addresses) is already outdated. The information itself is valuable but prices should be cross referenced.Through this book I was able to save more than a hundred dollars on a Lima-Cuzco flight. That fact alone pays for the book 4 times over.In short, if you want to visit Peru, Ecuador, or Bolivia on a budget this is your book but use it as a rough guide and not as your sole source of information."
3,Let's Go really (is bad),"I only bought this because it has Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia and I was going to all three and only those three.I previously used the England, Scotland, Ireland one.These books are not geared towards travelers who travel to learn rather than be sporty.They are helpful to an extent, but the Lonely Planet books seem to be more intelligent.Not all young travelers are out to party and shag the locals.*rolls eyes*"
3,Consumer edition different from dealer edition,I have reviewed the consumer edition of the book and found it different from the dealer edition and it was of no help in negotiating a lower price
1,Filthy/No floor,"Don't buy, it's JUNK!No mention on the listing, when I purchased this black photo tent, that there is no bottom (floor) to this tent. Also, the white nylon sides are FILTHY dirty!Would not recommend this!Find another seller to purchase from, even if it costs you a little more."
4,Not a low profile,"It looks ok, and was easy to put on, it just isn't really a ""low profile"" type of deflector.It doesn't lay low on the hood like I wanted, and like the picture shows, it sticks up a little more than that.Still, was a good purchase and I'm ok with it."
3,"Half of this cd is already on another cd, so be careful!","This is a very nice belly dance cd, with a lot of variety. However, if you have a large belly dance cd library, be careful. Half of the songs on this are already on ""Belly Dance Fantasy"", the cd with Veena & Neena on the front.I don't mean just the same songs, but the same versions by the same artists. I purchased this cd, and already had half of the songs..."
1,expensive,I think the prices are outrageous for a stuffed animal and should be reduced to a more reasonable price please change the prices and you will get more costumers<3THANK YOU I hope you understand
2,Disappointing!,"After hearing wild reviews about this author, I decided to try one of her books. I tried to get all the way through it but found my mind wandering too much about all the things the author throws in. I felt that there were too many things going on and found it hard to concentrate on the romance between the two main characters."
1,They Sent Me The Instructor's Edition,They sent me the instructor's edition instead of the right edition.They should include an ISBN # during the final online purchasing steps.
2,"So-so machine, needs a re-design","This humdrum little machine isn't spectacularly bad, but it's hardly a standout compared to other machines on the market.Contains a design defect I've seen on a couple other coffee makers out there; the inside of the water chamber allows condensation to form under the lid. This wouldn't be much of a problem except when you open the chamber, the condensation runs down the back, wetting the counter. Annoying. There are better machines out there."
1,roulette is crap,I read this book and the author doesn't take the time to verify his stats. On the system of roulette the quarters method he states you need a bankroll of 5200 min this is a lie you need at least 6200 min. He states that on the 11 12 13 spin if you win you recoup your money plus about a grand. Not so. Also on the 14th and 15th spin your risking 1250 and 1500 to supposedly win your money back --not so still at a loss. Also on the sections on thirds strategy he includes 26 in the 1st third but it should be 29. What a piss poor way of giving a strategy and of course I had to lose some money before I realized because you would think at least the math would be correct.
3,Where is KRAKATOA's widescreen???,"KRAKATOA EAST OF JAVA has finally made it to home video in a near complete form (only the theatrical overture, intermission and exit music apppears to be missing)running a full 131 minutes. The source material is in great shape with rich vibrant colors and good stereo sound. However, something is terribly wrong. The package proclaims special wide screen edition, but only the credits are letterbox. I believe this tape should be recalled. I would raise my rating a notch if this was truly wide screen like the box states. The movie is a guilty pleasure with corny plot and hackeyed performances, but the special effects are great. Best enjoyed on the giant Cinerama screens for which it was designed. Avoid the terrible Simitar DVD which though letteboxed, is a heavily cut version from tattered source materials."
3,krakatoa,"This flick is ok if you like oldies. I grew up with this kind of movies. To you youngsters the special effects might be corny but we didnt have much back then. I enjoyed it, but then I like the old movies better that some newer ones"
3,"Good Effects For It's Time, But Could Be Trimmed","I did not see this when it first came out in the theatres, but always wondered from the trailer if I should have. Now that I picked up a VHS copy, I might have enjoyed the special effects for it's time. The ship experiencing each of the portents and hazards is the most interesting aspect. However, the movie uses the Krakatoa explosion of 1883 as just a backdrop for a melodrama involving a tramp steamer on a mission to salvage a treasure in pearls from ship that happens to be sunk near the volcanic island. The scenes revealing each of the principle participants character and background run a little too long. This could be easily trimmed to 2 hours, including cutting the two songs, one of which is anachronistic in it's composition."
2,SAL MINEO is the only reason to have this film!,"This film is alful! And Krakatoa is WEST of Java,by the way! The only thing this film has going for it is SAL MINEO! I own this solely because Sal is in it."
2,Don't read or be fooled,"This series is a waste of time. The books before the fourth and final are entertaining, but don't keep reading. I wish someone had warned me! The final book leaves all loose endings untied, more unanswered questions, and is completely empty.Get away now."
2,welllllllllllllll,"it just happened over and over again. She 1st remembers that the guy she likes dies and she kinda the reason why it happened. But And she trying to figure out how she got her powers and the past on them. But this person or persons is stalking her and trying to kill her. And she starts liking a couple guys and notices that there behind the whole thing. And she feels whenever this ""Thing"" is around. But one day(shes living with her aunt) her cousin goes missing and finds out shes dead because of her stalker. The last thing you read in the book is "" When i walked up i saw this light i walked to it and when i looked down i gaged from the smell. It was my cousin covered in magets"""
1,So yesterday,This movie is way to dated. I watched it way back when it first came out. The humor I had as a teenage sure must have been pretty empty!
2,Movie very poor quality,The movie stalled and skipped several times during play. I will be returning this and purchasing from another vendor. How to return?
1,Deluxe my arse,"I want the shoulder strap they have pictured with the metal clips, the thickly padded stretchy neoprene and the red diving logo. I purchased the one pictured two years ago and it's still in excellent condition. The crap I received--from it's new vendor LeisurePro--is nothing like the one I want in the picture.This item deserved a ZERO star rating. So needless to say I mailed back the item to LeisurePro.I also visited their website to see if they had the same picture for this item and they do. I sent a request asking them to update their picture along with the one provided here on Amazon because it's totally misleading."
2,Lost in the Rabbit Hole,"Justly forgotten British musical based on the Lewis Carroll classic - redeemed only by Peter Sellers' inspired performance as the March Hare and the BAFTA-winning cinematography of Geoffrey Unsworth. Young children may enjoy ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"" but adults will be bored. A remastered widescreen version is available in the UK."
1,Very Poor 'Remastering',"The color is horrendous! Why can't this film be properly converted to DVD as others have been?Is it forbidden by the film industry? Has Tim Burton cornered the market on Alice in Wonderland remakes (or remakes, in general)?"
1,ALice in Wonderland,Very disappointed in the quality of this dvd- very poor sound and video...would not recommend it to anyone.
2,"Works for maintenance, won't pick up dried spills, etc","This works well for in between cleanings, but that's about it. If you have any type of marks on your floor, it won't clean them; you'll still have to use some type of conventional mop. It does work well for the disinfecting because of the steam, however, since you still have to clean your floor before hand, you will probably have already killed any bacteria if you are using any type of soap, bleach, or ammonia to clean your floor. Wouldn't buy it again or recommend it."
5,Great Floor Steamer if you have kids and pets!,This machine gets your floors clean! I tested it by mopping with clean water after I used my Enviro Steamer and the water was clean when I finished. I have a dog and three kids so this is not an easy accomplishment. It is much easier than mopping (no bending and wringing.) Highly recommended!
2,My steamer broke after a couple of months,"Well, needless to say, I don't use it anymore. After a couple of months, it just stopped working properly. And even before the product actually broke, I wasn't that satisfied with it. It does a good job of removing stuck on stains from the floor because of it's strong heating action, but since it doesn't really absorb the dirt into a suction tank or anything, loose dirt just gets shoved around. I found myself having to get on my hands and knees often to finish up a cleaning with this product."
1,Save your money,"I just HAD to have one of these after seeing it demonstrated. I have both vinyl and hardwood floors and pets. I thought this would be perfect. I swept first.....then Enviro Steamed....the pad had to be changed three or four times between 3 rooms....all filthy. I thought ""hmmm...must be doing a great job"". WRONG!! When the floors dried...they looked terrible. All streaky. So...I called the company. They suggested I clean all the floors first with vinegar and water...THEN....Envirosteam! WHY? SO I tried this.....still streaky. After the vinegar water wash they looked clean, but steamed them anyway. SHouldn't have. Mine is sitting in the basement, unused. By the way...my daughter also bought one and loved it the first couple of times on a NEW floor...but hers also started streaking. It just seems to smear dirt, not actually clean it."
1,"LIES, LIES, little truth, and MORE LIES","This book is soooo misleading. It is not the voice of God nor does it come from the word of God. If someone truly seeks advice and more understanding, he/she should get a Student Bible or an ""Understanding the Bible"" type of book from a Christian store. This book makes me want to vomit; knowing how many people are reading and believing the LIES that are COMPLETELY THROUGHOUT this book!"
1,Bantering - will the Real Jesus please stand up,"I've been reading all the reviews here - pro and con. Seems like some folks have been truly touched and others not. Whatever...I like the bottom line - the deepest, purest I can find. Jesus said, ''...he who believes in me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father.'' John 14:12I'd like to hear from someone with the highest credentials i.e. the ones who are healing all types of disease, casting out demons and raising the dead. The ones who are also taking care of the widows and orphans, giving out the cup of water, clothing the naked, taking in those who have no home, feeding the hungry, visiting those in prison.It's nice to read something to make us feel good but if we reach out and take care of others - that's where we'll really fulfill our purpose and feel great, be all that we can be. It's also the place where we'll find we're closest to our Creator, working side by side with him."
1,Conversations with God????,"Ugh!! This book was frustrating!! I didn't even want to finish it! Neale Donald Walsch says he is having a converastion with God but really it is just an idealistic converastion he is having with himself, where his higher consciousness debates with his lower consciousness. He has some nice ideas but it's really just one big, long journal entry where he tries to play God. Pretty insulting. This is sappy, pseudo-spiritual stuff."
2,Is a Book Really Worth It?,"I read this book a while ago, and it doesn't seem that it offers anything earth-shattering.Sure, there will be the people who say that it changed their life. And there will also be the people who say that it's utter heresy.I ascribe to neither extreme. Hell, I'm not even in the continuum.Walsch may or may not be genuine when he says that he doesn't actually know if God inspired him to write this book. That does somewhat depend on his personal beliefs. However, whether he is genuine or not, you have to ask yourself if you will take the word of this man at face value.If I was in the position to purchase this book again, I wouldn't bother. It doesn't really offer much in the way of insight that I haven't already picked up from studying other moral traditions."
5,CRITICS,"CRITICS your contradicting yourself with your Judgement. Seems as though you have expertise over comman knowledge. If what you say is garbage and unfit to read, why do you read it...if you feel this way?? Are we lacking something?? By the way this is a great book."
5,What a relief!,"Read this book and you too will exclaim ""Phew! What a relief!."" God has a sense of humor! Hurray!The second book is even better than the first but I wouldn't skip number one.I will re-read them until number three is released. I loved these books and thank God Neale Walsch has shared them with us. God bless."
2,Be Careful What You Believe,"This book is yet another subjective leap into the realm of dreams and myth. It is wholly irresponsible in it's depiction of reality. The basic messages of ""be who you truly are"" and to have faith that life has meaning are nice, but anybody can tell you that. Few spiritual teachers (outside of destructive cults) will tell you that you are a meaningless, souless monkey whose only purpose in life is to ultimately feed the earthworms. Naturally, such a book would not sell. Truly, there is strength and security in faith, but that is true of all religions, weather true or fabricated. I suggest to anyone who has read and loved this book that they research the history of religion and contrast it with the God depicted by Neale. Start with The History Of God by Karen Armstrong. Then, read, The History of the Devil by Gerald Messadie. Both of these works contain an amazing amount of information grounded in solid research."
2,CWG vs Quran,Anyone who has evan read a part of the Quran can easily tell the differance between the real word of God and the pathetic attempt by Iblis to deceive anyone seeking truth.
2,Two surprises,"There were two surprises for me in Book One: 1. God is a vegetarian, 2. He badly needs an editor."
1,No shortage of ego here!,"I've read the entire Conversations With God series...obviously it resonated with me at some level, at least when I first encountered it. But eventually I began to find these books very self-serving...I can't remember which book it's in, but in one place we find God approving of the author's marriage vows. It gets quite silly and self-aggrandizing. I agree that God isn't punishing and vengeful, but some of the ideas in these books are completely off the wall."
2,Reader's Digest Condensed Spirituality or Pop Spirituality,"This is the book you get when you pass through the gates of ""New Age"" tried and worn of traditional religion. Not so profound as a rehash of eastern spirituality for the western mind. Which explains why it seems to new and refreshing to the average westerner. Hopefully the reader won't stop here but grow beyond the Walsch's and Redfields and Chopras of the world and move on to the great eastern works like those of Ramana Maharshi, Osho, Vivekananda, Nityananda, Sri Nisargadatta, Neem Karoli Baba, Babaji, Bodhidharma, Gurdjieff, Meher Baba, U.G. Krishnamurti.Go and read the works of those I have given you. You won't find any of them selling CDs, desk calendars, workbooks or massage oil. Just the truth and nothing but the truth."
1,A collection of falsehoods!,"This book, as well as the sequels, contain a few truths, many half-truths and many falsehoods. God has given us free will and would not force someone's hand to write things. This book states there is no wrong and no right. And in one of the sequels, he states that Hitler is in heaven *because he doesn't view his actions as wrong.* What convenient thinking for the rest of us! And what dangerous thinking! The road to Heaven is narrow, not a superhighway. I fear many souls will be lost by following the false teachings of this book."
1,Conversations with the author's accountant,"What a great idea! Conversations with God! Why didn't anyone think of this before? It's bound to make millions. At the very least, one has to doubt ""God's"" eloquence when he asked the author if he was simply ""venting."" Does God speak modern American? At best it's an honest delusion, but the intention to personally benefit from what should have been a moment that transcended exploitation of the experience, this is yet another cynical exercise. It's the face-of-Jesus-on-a-piece-of-toast version of the book world. Still, if he's prepared to face the consequences of being a false prophet, that's his problem."
1,Heresy,"The Amazon review starts with the correct words: Heresy, Blasphemy. That's all this book is filled with. It takes the Word of God (the Bible) out of context many times and at other times totally contradicts God! I can't believe this book is even out there. The author, publishers and any one who distributes this book should be ashamed!This book is the work of Satan!"
1,You Too Can Make Money By Imagining,"Close your eyes. Pretend that you are you. Think of a question for God. Type it. Now close your eyes again. Pretend that you are God. Answer the question. Easy, isn't it? And guess what, folks, it also turned out to be a very lucrative exercise for Donald Neale Walsch. He does seem to trip up once in awhile by giving forth wisdom that most people would have a hard time swallowing (""Hitler went to heaven"" ""God doesn't love good more than evil""); but, for the most part he puts in truisms we all have been taught and long ago accepted.H-m-m-m let me ask: Do you suppose that since God channelled this book, he donated all of the proceeds back to God? To the poor? To the hungry? H-m-m-m I doubt it very seriously.Skip the book. Your common sense will give you the same and better benefits for free."
2,Does not live up to the hype.,"After reading this book for my October bookclub meeting, I was hard pressed to find out what all the hype about this book was about. While there were aspects of the book that were thought provoking, I failed to see the merit this book supposedly has. I also found myself wondering why his conversation was worth publishing. I found it interesting that on many occasions when the book got boring, which it often did, I could jump around and not lose a beat....that's not saying much. In the end, I just did not like the book very much, again, aspects of it were thought provoking, but all in all I'd not highly reccomend this book. The Road Less Traveled was better."
1,"I talked to God, Neale, and she didn't mention you.","Okay, now that I have your attention...I am sure that Walsch believes that he was talking with God. I have no problem with that at all. Like someone else in this review list, I gave it one star so that my review would be read. Truly, I would give it four.People have problems with the arrogance, the declaration of truth, etc. in the book. I don't. In fact, I think all of it makes a lot of sense. It all touched upon things that I would come up with myself, given time. I'm just not a divorced person in my forties yet. I wonder how Walsch's exwife feels about the books? In any event, Walsch helped me find my way to the path of enlightenment, and for that, I am grateful. May others join us in love and peace."
5,"""God is a Salame Sandwich""","Simply one of the most amazing books I have ever read. Although some people may claim this to be New-Age-y, it is in fact completely contemporary in nature, speaking of life in general and existence. Some may claim that the author is trying to start his own religion: This is hardly the case. And for those of you who don't actually believe that these are God's words: Your loss. I don't mind the many times this book contradicts (some sometimes insults) the New Testament (or even the Old), since I am Jewish, though not incredibly religious. Everything makes sense in this book once you think about it (Explanations get longer and more concise as you read along, so if you get it the first time, you can skip ahead)."
5,Amazed,I am amazed at the effeciency and customer service on all the products I have ordered. I wish more companies would follow your lead. Thank you and keep up the great work.
5,Guilt Free Living,Success in life is highly dependent on comfort in one's spiritual zone-in my humble opinion.The author engages the reader toward development of spiritual self in this 'uncommon dialogue' and I appreciated his perception and my growth and development were stimulated by this work. I hope you enjoy it as I do. I read parts again and again and find myself choosing it ahead of the bible-sometimes.A really great book for your bedside.
4,Excellent book for all kinds of people,"I read this book a few years ago and it's interesting to write a review looking back on it. The book contains a range of great insights which have personally helped my life in a number of ways. The most important of these has been spiritual calm in certain times. However, I now look on the whole series with a grain of salt - certainly I would not recommend treating this book as the guide for living. I don't think it was intended to be viewed as such. But reading it while knowing that, like most people, you'll pick and choose things out of it to help you will mean that you read it with an open mind.This first book in the series is the start of the conversation and deals with introducing the concepts that are developed in books 2 and 3. As such, it focuses on questioning some fundamental beliefs about life and as such is a good exercise. The people who turn this book into so much more are doing it an injustice."
1,Conversations with (WHICH) God?,"One thing becomes appallingly apparrent when you begin reading this tripe, and that is that the author hasn't the faintest clue as to who the God of the Holy Bible is. I speculate as to whether or not the author has ever opened the pages of Scripture to realize that God never commands us to feel Him, or use our experiences to understand Him; rather it is a continual pursuit to know Him. And we begin to know Him through the WORDS of Scripture. This book falls right into the abysmal decadence of such other titles as ""God Chaser's"" (another book destined to reduce God to a fabrication of our feelings).If you are a Christian or someone who seeks God, stay away from this bbok and others like it and get back to the original word of God...The Holy Bible!sam"
4,heartfelt,"This book has taught me a very important philosophy: living your life constantly attempting to structure the universe to fit your ego will ultimately lead to a relatively safe, but very lonely and empty existence, devoid of intimacy or any deeper emotional connection with anything other than your own isolation from the world. I hope at least some of you realize this before you wake up in your twilight years to find that you have completely wasted the one life you will ever have a chance to live."
1,misleading,Don't be fooled by the title of this book. It goes against all of Gods teachings. I found it offensive. If you want to have a conversation with god I can recommend a good resource its called The Holy Bible!
1,"Does not align with Scripture, not a Christian book","If you have spent anytime in Scripture, you will recognize quickly that this book does not bear truth. It adds to Scripture unabashedly and even misquotes it. Do not buy this book if you believe the God of the Bible and are searching for a closer relationship with God. The god of this book is not the God of the Bible. There are authors who are devoted to only spreading the truth...look for them."
4,CONVERSATIONS WITH GOD: AN UNCOMMON DIALOGUE,"God speaks to each and every one of us precisely where we are. Thank God Neale Donald Walsch was listening!Although it's been some years since I read the book in its entirety, my dim recollection of it remains overwhelmingly positive. Of course I intend to read the book again...Very much like ""A Course in Miracles"" (Original Edition at [...]), Mr. Walsch received an inner dictation which he put down on paper.We can all benefit from the deep wisdom and insight this book provides us. I look forward with anticipation to reading the sequel!"
5,quick&fast,"What a great surprise that the book I ordered mid-Dec. arrived from this book seller within 5 days - before Christmas - great service! Important look at She/He aspect of a worn cliche of ""god"" Book 2, of all 3 books...awesome and inspiring"
2,Some dead Asian Indian pretending to be God,"A pretty original revelation from ""God"" promising to solve humanity's problems: Hell doesn't exist, Satan does neither. All sexual problems can be solved, if children are allowed to fiddle freely with their genitals. Inequality in society can be solved by forcing all the rich to make their total income public. Sex is just wonderful, and matriarchy is the natural sort of regime for mankind.Child-rearing should be let over to competent people as grand-parents or still better the society.As far as I can see, it is some dead Indian who tries to bless humanity with his own best view of how the world and mankind really functions."
1,highlignted in dark color.,I was not expecting the book to come completely highlighted in pink. It is hard to read because the prior reader used a dark highlight. Can I send this book back and get another one?
1,Based on nothing,"I prefer to give the book no star. Read II Timothy 3:16. All scripture is given by inspiration of God. The word of the Lord is living, tried, pure, right, and are the words man shall live by. The Bible is the infallible Word of God. Man shall live by the Word of God(Matthew 4:4, John 16:13)and be led by the Holy Spirit, not one's feelings as this book suggests. Our feelings change from moment to moment, day to day. God never changes. His Word is sure and true. Supplication is one form of Prayer (I Timothy @:1, Phillipians 4:6). Ask according to His will (I John 5:14, John 15:7, Mathew 7: 7 and 8). Don't be deceived (Hebrews 9:27). It is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgement (II Timothy 4:1, Romans 14:10-12, Revelation 20: 11-15)."
1,Satanic in Message,"To deny the existence of sin is to deny the sacrifice of Christ, and therefore the Divinity of God. It is the devils' weapon to make people stop believing in his existence, and that everything is just psychological.BE WARE of this BOOK !"
1,A total sham and anti-Christian fabrication.,"This new age fraud's series of books are full of lies and fabrications, claiming to be the voice of God. This book claims that God suggests that value-less moral relativism (no good or evil)is the path to a ""new world order"" which denies the truth of love and Christianity and the absolute power of God. These books, vols. 1,2,3 are the most damaging attempt by an anti-Christian to undermine the truth of Jesus Christ. Don't believe a word of it. I'm writing a book called The Practical Guide to Real Christianity which will dispel the lies and fabrications of the shameful author of this pathetic attempt at deception."
1,A total and utter sham and fabrication. (antiChristian),"This new age fraud's series of books are full of lies and fabrications, claiming to be the voice of God.

I'm writing a book called The Practical Guide to Real Christianity which will dispel the lies and fabrications of the shameful author of this pathetic attempt at deception."
1,Wish I Could Give a Negative Star!,"I am appalled and shocked by this book. There's something clearly wrong here if this man claims to be sharing with us what God thinks, because according to Walsch, most of what God thinks is clearly opposite of what the Bible says. This author is using God's name to tell people to feel good about yourself and do whatever you want. That is NOT the attitude of our loving, but just God. If you really want to know what God thinks buy His bestseller - the Bible!"
5,THE AGAPE...,"AGAPE is disinterested LOVE...AGAPE does not begin by discriminating worthy and unworthy people, or any qualities people posses. It begins by loving others for their sakes... Therefore, AGAPE makes no distinction between friend and enemy; it directed toward both._______________MARTIN LUTHER KING JR._____________"
5,"FAITH-FULL, BOLD, ENCOURAGING (GOD FORBID, RIGHT?)","It's so encouraging to know that not everyone in the world is deaf (to God). For a while, I was the only person I knew, that actually posessed the faith that all the religious finatics only preached about, even though they don't seem to believe that God blessed them with the capability to come to good, positive morals and values without the hippocritical teachings of religions. I'm so glad that this book is out there for God to lead those that want to hear him speak directly to them. Doesn't the bible say something about pride, judgement and persecution? Maybe the religious skeptics should review the bases for their own belief system (the bible) before commenting. I mean it's just one more contradiction to add to the list. I commend Mr. Walsch for speaking God's mind. Who am I to say that it isn't (God's mind he's speaking), especially when it seems what God has to say is so much more encouraging than that of any religion."
5,Opening up new paths,I used to not believe in god and blame him for my problems. I read this book and everythings changed. Im not a christian or a jew or a muslim or a member of any religion. All I have to do is believe this book. I now have the faith of a mustard seed.
4,This is tough on the heart...........,"Okay I just finished this book, and now I can review it..But this is tough, really tough...you want to believe, but there's a part of you that doesnt, my instincts are saying that this isnt all true, and that perhaps this guy is getting some things thru god, but other things..well I just don't know...I want to believe so bad, but I seem to always follow my instincts, and they have always been pretty much on target....God I hope i'm wrong, no pun intended, and I hope God will not look down upon me, if one day we find out this really was god talking thru this guy...but I can't help it..I just have these feelings, and they wont go away...but I know one thing is for sure..this definitley wasnt written vicariously thru the devil, (and yes I sincerely hope he doesnt exist) because it is all about love, and bettering yourself, and I cannot find anything wrong in a book about THAT."
5,"illuminating, except on one fine point","illuminating, if read with an open mind. however, i question the rationale behind hitler going to heaaven. i can understand that hitler, as with just about anyone, had tried to create his interpretation/version of heaven on earth. that is, it could be said that his interpretation of heaven on earth is one without the peoples he murdered. if we are all here to ""remember ourselves,"" and in the process of so doing we also inevitably try to mould circumstances that fit our individual interpretation of heaven, then where does this leave society's almost unanimous agreement of the benefits of virtues such as honesty, loyalty and compassion if murderers such as hitler are given free reign to interpret and create heaven?"
4,Thought provoking and exciting.,"I originally began this book in the middle and the dialogue grabbed me so fast I found I needed to start at the beginning. The contents of this book will inspire anyone interested in faith, who have ever questioned ""faith"" or their relationship with their Higher Power. This volume focuses on the individual and his/her relationship with themselves, others and their Higher Power. The author begins the book as an angry letter to God, which is, to his amazement, answered! Although written from one person's point of view, the questions asked by God, and answered by God, make one eager for more. I devoured this book in a three hour sitting and immediately went out for Volume II. I am anxiously awaiting, Volume III."
2,How dare does God prefer one sex over another?,"I was taking a look at Conversations with God: Book 2, and it seemed like a wonderful sequel to Book 1...until I hit upon Chapter 6. God puts men down blatantly in this chapter like you wouldn't believe. Sorry, but the God that I love treats both sexes as equals. My God loves _all_ creation, not just half of it."
5,True Inspiration In A Time Of Pain,This book helped to make sense out of my life and rescue me from the deep hell of depression and anxiety. When I read this book I was at one of the lowest points in my life. It never made sense to me how an all loving God could be so judgemental and condeming as many religions teach. I always had such a problem with this ideaology. I have attended many churches in search for truth and all I found was judgement and condemnation to hell. This was very discomforting to me considering I like many others have done things that the christian religions would consider ultimate sins. Those people who call this book a false representation of God need to really think about how what an all loving God truly looks like. Mr. Walsh was truly inspired to help others and I feel that he changed the life of many especially me.
5,Listen to the dialogue,"As I was reading this incredible book, I couldn't help wondering if God really was speaking through Walsch. It seemed so true, and I agreed with everything that was spoken. It was an enlightening book that anyone who needs to define their beliefs should read."
5,Thank you Neale Donald Walsch,READ IT!! Make time in your life to absorb the context of this book. Be ready to challenge your current ways of thinking and living and most of all BE CREATIVE!
1,As long as you realize what this book really is...,"This is not at all Christian. It is, however, completely representative of the therapeutic, self-fulfilling kindliness that passes for Christianity in America these days. If that's all you're looking for, here's a deception that will effectively lull you into a warm, cozy and shallow life of obtuseness. It's like deliberately choosing to turn yourself into a ""smiley face"". What kind of person settles for that?If you are Christian, stick with the Bible and your church. Those provide the challenging truths a person needs to understand, along with the reassurance and affirmation that keeps us striving to be fully human, the likeness and image of God."
1,"If you want God, go to his Word, not a man","God bless the confused and misled! If you want to hear from God, try praying and read the Word that He gave us. If you don't believe in the validity of the Bible then what makes this man or any other man right???? You have questions for God but first you must ask yourself what you believe in and what you want you faith to rest on. God does not intend to make us feel good about everything we do or want. He wants us to conform to Him but this man is conforming God to what he wants Him to be. Beware of false prophets!"
1,False Perspective,"This book repeatedly contradicts Holy scriptures. Although interesting, it is a false perspective (based on God's Holy word) of who God is."
1,Wish there was a ZERO star rating-,I agree with many others who are rating this a one star. This is not Christianity. Humanism is trying to cloak itself here - it is sad that so many reviewers are being mislead to think this is a great book.
1,A Real Conversation with God,"I don't know who's voice the author was really hearing, but to have a real conversation with God, you only need to ask for one with him. To read God's expectations for you, read the Holy Bible, the greatest and most read book in the world."
1,Below normal comprehension,"This book is utter dribble. Some passages remind me of text written by hippies high on drugs. When one starts having conversations with themselves that's usually not a good thing. I don't need Mr. Walsch to answer my questions, if I have questions to ask of God, I'll go the original source -- my bible. I have more confidence in the consistency and accuracy of the bible's answers than I do of a man responding to voices in his head.And why do people assume God does not love unconditionally. Wasn't that the whole purpose of Jesus' sacrafice. Plus He shows his love the way any parent would. Didn't all of our parents punish us if we did something wrong like lie. They disliked that we lied and punished us for it, but that didn't stop them from loving us or continuing to provide for us."
3,"Conversations with myself, not God","I choose to grade this book high on content (some good questions), yet low on intent (Lets sell some books here). The author has chosen to use a common technique that is available to everyone. That is to ask the universe, God or the devine to answer a question or questions and then listen or feel for the answers. Anyone can do it. The author has cleverly used the word God in his title and throughout the book, even going so far as stating that the God character has addressed himself as God, which I feel is quite misleading. I agree with several of the reviewers who state that he is appealing to the devine in himself. Don't be fooled this isn't God the father he is speaking to. Maybe the title would better be stated as Conversations With My Spiritual Self."
4,interesting and provocative,"Did God really write the answers to this guy's questions by taking control of his arm? It's a strange image and the answer isn't really discussed in the book. Still, the ideas are interesing and organized religion gets a major drubbing! Concepts about God being judgmental and punishing sinners in Hell is totally blown out of the water. Interestingly enough, this book reminded me of a lot of things you hear when you do the Landmark Forum.... and they never claimed to be a religious institution. In the end, I'm left smiling but wondering what the real story behind this book is."
1,"This should be re-titled ""conversations with Satan""","This is a very dangerous book for non-Christians. This book goes against God's word. Please read the Bible and learn the truth. ""And you will know the truth and the truth will set you free."" John 8:32"
5,Finally! Someone willing to be HONEST and unafraid!,"This is by far one of my new favorite spiritual reads. The author was able to capture my husband and I's very complex yet authentic beliefs about our greater Self and Source in this ONE book better than any other I've ever read. It makes you THINK and have rigorous honesty when it comes to the Truth vs the truth MAN has created! Anyone not willing to break out of the box and think for yourself while following your intuition and authentic nature... don't bother reading, this book will offend you. However, if you're ready to grow and remove the shackles of man made religion while healing many deep spiritual wounds from past religious experiences, then you will hold sacred the truths in this book. Peace."
5,UNCONDITIONAL LOVE IS WHAT WE NEED!!,"The message in this book is about the unconditional love NOT FEAR BASE THEOLOGY. I don't blame this book if it became the best sellers people learned so much from it.THERE IS NO FEAR IN LOVE, BUT PERFECT LOVE CAST (DRIVES) OUT FEAR BECAUSE FEAR HAS TO DO WITH PUNISHMENT, AND SO ONE WHO FEAR IS NOT YET PERFECT IN LOVE. (1 JOHN 4:18)GOD IS LOVE, AND WHOEVER REMAINS IN LOVE REMAINS IN GOD AND GOD IN HIM. (1 JOHN 4:16)The message is so clear about the unconditional love. As you call it PERFECT LOVE!! PRAISE TO YOU NEIL FOR BRINGING IT TO THE LIGHT."
2,conversations with God: an uncommon dialogue,"The author was not kidding, this was uncommon, from a Christian perspective that is. This book is not based on scripture, nor anything close to what I believe as a Christian. It is based on experience and not faith in the bible. If you are looking for Christian books, this should be one of your last picks."
3,Book of information,I did not read the book the book and the journal was a gift to a friend. Thank you so much for the book
4,Interesting.,Still reading. Only makes sense if you have read part I. It is an open dialouge with god and Donald Walsch.
2,How can we answer the question: Why are we living?,"This is a good book for looking to life in a happy way. But there is a major failure here, since 'Why are we living?' question should be asked to 'GOD' -Who created the all universe & all human beings- and we should look for the message from the GOD. Not we should just imagine & go into our way.The positive & happy look to life was written in a perfect way in Risale-i Nur Kulliyati, (including The Words 1-2, and The Flashes) by Said Nursi Bediuzzaman.Anyone like this Conversations with God-1-2-3, I advise Risale-i Nur Kulliyati (The Nur Collection) by Said Nursi Bediuzzaman to completely understand & learn 'WHY ARE WE LIVING on earth? and WHAT IS THE AIM & GREATEST HAPPINESS OF LIFE?."
1,HELLO...no stars would be better!,DID the man even read the scriptures??? Remember they are the word of god and all throughout they talk about right and wrong and making right decisions...I guess in his eyes we can kill and that is okay too!Heavenly Father loves us and will forgive us of whatever sins if we repent. Basic tenent of the bible but there is a right and a wrong!!!PLEASE...use your brain people! Don't waste your money!
1,THE SEASON IS COMING,"The bible talks about When the diciples asked how will they know when he (Jesus) is returning and he gave a parable saying that you will know when the time is coming by the season like everyone can tell when summer is coming by the changing wheather and so on well here Jesus is saying that you will know by the stuff going Around you if this book is true or the ideas behind them then how come it was not around since the beginng you know the charcter of God is forever God has power to do anything but to sit there and go ""Oh wait here's this new idea i forgot to metion sorry bout that."" but he didn't so but you know there will come a day when evey knee will bow and confess Jesus Christ as Lord of all"
1,make that a lower case g = god,Mr. Walsch's view of who God is has some serious discrepancies from the God of the Bible. He's made up his own god to fit what he wants God to be. To challenge your thinking I guess you can go ahead & read. However I challenge you to check it against the ultimate authority and that is God's Word - the Bible.
1,THIS IS NOT A CONVERSATION WITH THE REAL GOD!,"First of all, I would have given ZERO stars to this book, but that wasn't a rating option. After reading a portion from the book, I read the introduction by the author. Then, I randomly read pages throughout the entire book. IF YOU ARE A CHRISTIAN, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU! I do not know if the author is a rip-off artist or if he is truly conversing with another power, but this is pure rot, perhaps pure evil. The advice ""god"" gives in the book is totally anti-Christian, no matter what your Christian denomination is. Do not give your money to this crook or his publishers! Buy something truly Christian and burn any copy of this trash you come across."
4,A True Inspiration,I was given this book by a co-worker without any expectations. Since I have been soul searching most of my life I thought this might be a fun read. Wow! What an inspiration. It opened the door to spirituality for me. I felt like if I had a one-on-one with God these would be the same answers I would receive. I encourage anyone who is striving for an understanding to give this a read!
5,Is it actually God?,"I first read this book in August of 1997. The impact it's had is difficult to explain. Could it, would it really be our Lord?? It is a wonderful book (from my perspective) none the less. It intriques, mystifies, and caused me to really look at my Spirituality. It also caused my head to spin, if only from the perspective that God spoke to a regular guy! I have had a significant amount of exposure to Christianity, and I found nothing that whacked me in the head as sounding ""Blasphemous"". Book 3 deals with some very heady issues regarding death, and the ""creating"" of our own reality. Thus far, I'm having a little more difficulty with this one, so I'll reserve comment. On a closing note, thank you Lord for revealing yourself to us in meaningful ways."
5,a magnificent opus,"the most accessible and personally relevant book on spirituality i""ve ever encountered."
1,A poor reproduction.,"Neale Donald Walsch and his publisher have walked a very thin line with this work. It is surprising that the family of the late Helen Schucman, Mr. Bill Thetford, and Penguin Books are not suing them. Anyone, and I do mean anyone who has even read, A Course in Miracles, would award damages."
1,from the pit of hell,"This book is a tool of Satan. The author claims that it was inspired by God, which is nonsense because most of it is in direct conflict with what God has revealed in His Word, the Bible. There is only one ""version"" of Christianity and that is found in the Bible. If you are interested in what God thinks, I would suggest reading the Bible, it is full of God's thoughts. If you are interested in reading books about the Bible, based on the Bible, I would suggest, for starters, ""What Jesus Demands from the World"" by John Piper. Please don't waste your time on any of Mr. Walsch's books. Burn them! - they are too dangerous to throw in the trash."
4,Strengthen my Christian Faith.,"Excellent book - subject and style. Hopefully we all have conversations with God on a consistent basis. God's grace is not addressed or reported in this book - that's hardly unique in secular art. What is unique is that the Christian Faith is the only one to promote, create, and allow God's grace."
5,Insightful,"Great book - easy to read and comprehend. It helped me find comfort in the answers that I already knew.....it helped me to find myself. If you're soul-searching, this is a must-read."
5,Very enlightening,"This book is kind of ""scary."" Some of it just doesn't jive with what we have always been taught about God and religion. I do think the Lord gave us a mind to use and an imagination to wonder, and I do not think it a sin, blasphemy, or heresy to ask questions about God and the Bible, since we know the Bible was written by man, inspired, just as Mr. Walshe obviously has been inspired.I'm still a ""babe"" in the matters of religion, but this book has really given me something to think about, along with my faith that Jesus Christ did die for me so that I may have enternal life.I have only read Book I, but am definitely looking forward to Books II and III. I pray to God that He opens my eyes to His truths, so that I may be the person he wants me to be."
1,bad boring book - don't waste your time,"If he was conversing with God, why didn't he ask useful, verifiable questions: What is the cure for AIDS? What is the equation for the Grand Unified Theory?"
1,HORRIBLE BOOK - BEWARE,"I tried leaving no stars for this book, because this book doesn't deserve one, but it wouldn't let me, so I was forced to leave one.This book certainly is a sign of our times. It shocks me that parents would even think that this book would be an accurate account of what God would preach. All I can say is that any Christian knows better than to believe this garbage. By the looks of the ratings of this book, there isn't too many Christians reading it and unfortunately, many, many young people are reading it believing it as truth. Very sad!"
3,Whose I Am,"""Conversations with God"" is thought provoking in the author's synthesis and comments involving many philosophies and religious teachings. My main criticism is the overemphasis of the ""divinity of mankind."" Man as both subject and object is akin to Ayn Rand's ""The Virtue of Selfishness- a new concept in egoism."" The exploration of Who I Am should also include Whose I Am."
4,Calibration as per Power vs Force,"The average level of truth of CWG I, as I determined it using a modified version of the method described in 'Power vs. Force' by David R. Hawkins (testing my own anterior deltoid muscle), calibrates at 553, ie. the level of joy, at the emotional level of serenity, a worldview of completeness, and spiritual awareness at the level of oneness. This is also slightly higher than that of some current versions of the Bible, eg. the NIV Study Bible, which calibrates at 527 by the same method, well into the level of love. The implications of this calibration, assuming it is correct, can be studied in Hawkins' book (itself calibrating at an extra-ordinary level of ca. 750), which I warmly recommend. To me, calibrating at 477, the implication is that this book is useful, albeit clearly imperfect."
1,MADE YOU LOOK !,"Thanks to those with the clever idea of using the one star rating to attract review readers. I have read books 1 and 2. The experience has changed my life to say the least, so my ""real"" rating would be 5 stars. I had spent many years wondering why god had made us all so different, yet the ""rules"" were so general. The information god gives to Neale makes perfect sense to me, and has removed ALL elements of confusion from my life. Is it just a scam? Have I been ""duped"" by some new-age marketing genius? Is Neale simply crazy? Who knows, and WHO CARES?! If CWG is evil, blasphemous trash, then I relate well to evil, blasphemous trash! If you're reading any of these reviews and haven't read the book(s) yet, it's probably your time to discover them. I'm sure that you'll either feel thrilled, disgusted, or something in between."
1,Ack! Ack! Ack! I Wish I Had My Money Back!,If you love God and have been in relationship with him for some time you'll recognize this for the Junk that it is. What scares me is the fate of the new seekers who may get ahold of this trash. Walsh is suffering from delusions of grandeur after having taken Philosophy 101. Pray for this poor man but more so for his duped followers.
1,Lies mixed with truth...like poop mixed in brownies.,"Lies mixed with truth...like poop mixed in brownies. Don't believe it! I believe most of us have heard ""beware of false prophets"" and how Satan entices men to mix the truth with lies so that we believe the false beliefs of man. In this book we are certainly coaxed to believe in the IDEAS OF MAN. It is said that in the days to come ""We will be led to believe that that which is evil is good, and that which is good, evil."" Well, those days are here and evident in this book. Mr. Donald even said in his interview with Larry King that he admitted that it definitely may have been his own subconscious mind ""hearing"" God and not the voice of God at all."
5,"Beautiful, creative, & powerful!","If you are seeking a profound relationship with God, and are open to being mentally and spiritually challenged, this book will resonate with your soul.........If you are caught up in religious dogma, a belief in one ""right"" way, or have a vision of God as separate, commanding, and vengeful, you will struggle with each page........But, hopefully, in your struggle, you will find growth, awareness, and new feelings of tolerance, compassion, connection, and Love.........The words, concepts, and ideas presented significantly altered my life.........Remember, miracles come with a shift in perception............."
5,The Truth,"Yes the fount of all knowledge really is here. It is also written into the essence of every being if you just stop and listen to yourself. This is wisdom expressed with a lucidity and accessibility that is beyond misinterpretation. The world will literally change overnight when its mindset alters from one of greed to one of equality and compassion. The secret is easy...allow yourself to observe the truth and act on it. Not convinced? Heard it all before? The books (vols 1-3) will answer every question you can conceive of about the nature of the universe and all life. After having searched for truth over the years (and why the world is the way it is) it ends here with these works, and yet the search has just begun with this definitive word on the subject (and what subject could be greater?). Read them, understand them, listen and observe. They will even answer themselves as to any doubts you may have about their authenticity. Need I say more?"
1,Oh my God!,"How silly. It's amazing that so many take it seriously. Walsch sounds like a teenager trying to figure out why things are the way the are. But he should know better, there are no answers (except maybe 42, as Douglas Adams might had suggested). From the raging zealots that declare the book is a work of Satan to the spiritually distressed that see it as a ""life changer"", I could find no reviews that suggested that, maybe, the answers are up to us, or even accepting that sometimes there are no answers."
1,a systematic apostasy,"The re-interpretation (mis-interpretation) of the Truths of God, equal to that of the snake of old in Genesis 3:5, are presented here in a modern ""systematic theology"" I give it five fallen stars."
1,"Facile, puerile, self-indulgent,...","...the philosopher's equivalent of an adolescent wet dream, an idle pastime that must occur to every bright six-year-old. It's been done before, and better, by Raymond Smullyan. Too bad such cheap drivel seems to strike such a resonant chord."
1,"""CULTURALLY"" sound book with nothing aligning with the actual Word of God","What do todays Christians really think? Can a christian live a semi productive life according to the Word of God and expect nothing to backlash? Well here you have it! In this book you will find nothing but OPINIONS! There is no sound doctrine whatsoever in this book! Again I wish to iterate again, again, and again until I am blue in the face, we live in a culture that allows homosexuals to marry, abortions, etc...this book is a synopsis of our Laissex-faire attitude towards our christian beliefs! So in my OPINION, it will only go down hill from here until an ""Old Time Revival"" breaks forth. So till then, prepared for more of these so called ""New enlightenment crap"". I suppose if your head is in a hole and you want to really know where we stand spiritually here in America, read this book to truly comprehend where we are headed."
2,More of the same....,"I looked forward to reading Walsch's book, and I came away somewhat dissappointed. This is just the ""Course In Miracles"" stuff repackaged. Instead of something refreshingly different, the author decides to talk about *yawn"" the big bad ego, and how we ask for everything we get in this life. I have often wondered if we ""get what we deserve"" karmically, then why punish the thief or mugger? After all, he was just giving us our ""karma."" In another of the author's books, he speaks of how ""wonderful"" DeGeneres and Heche are for being so ""courageous."" After awhile it comes off like any other left-wing treatise. The one saving grace about this book is the fact that the author found a peace that eluded him most of his life. I believe he was/is sincere, but you have probably read the same thing many other places."
1,Not a Christian God...,"If you want to read about God ... as in Christian God, go to the Bible. If you want a book that will make you feel good about all your choices and that will avoid anything that might ""offend"" you for making bad choices, this is your book. This book is basically the opinion of the author about what his god would say about particular actions and/or situations. If you're looking for a ""feel good"" not too committal or deep regard for Christian values, this is your book. If you want something more legit...that speaks truthfully about the word of God, again, go to the Bible. This book finds ways to justify any action you make as ""okay"" and without serious consequence. The title is a bit deceiving."
5,OH HEAVEN YES,"This simply teached you how to have a Conversation With GOD. It's that simple but it can go a long way. I started with this and continued to book 2, 3 Friendship with Gos and Communion with God. My life has been easier with this knowledge."
5,fantastic book!!,"actually, this isn't a book about a man talking to god. it is a book about a man becoming a god. something that we all should consider to do by the way. and we can only be gods in the name of one thing: love. and that's what this book is all about. love.and if you understand, accept and remember, you know that all you really need...is love."
3,Conversations with God,The book had noticeable markings & stains on the cover which were not in te description.
1,Conversations With God,"I had high hopes for this book, but found it rather disappointing. Its not that I do not subscribe to the teachings in the book, its that I find many of the teachings as they are presented, contradicting them self. Its a hodge podge of many different works put together in a clever but some what careless way. One thing I believe God to be is consistent, this book is not consistent. I wanted desperately for this to be a great spiritual work, but came up disillusioned. In fact I could not even finish it. On the positive side, if it brings people closer to God and helps them to look for there own answers, I rate it a 5 star."
1,Satanic Garbage,"What it has to say about Christ Jesus proves that there was demonology behind this book. Those who follow this, walking away from the Truth of Jesus Christ, have placed their souls in jeapardy."
1,A Formula to Make Millions,"This is yet another example of someone realizing that gullible people number in the millions, and therefore much money can be made, even from blatant lies, e. g., ""I'm talking with God."" Don't even bother - use the time to come up with your own ideas, based on your experience and knowledge!"
2,More political opinion than divine giudance.,"Compared to Book 1, this was a bit of a disappointment. As with the first, it contains a good deal of wisdom, but this one appears to be more of a personal political commentary than a source of divine inspiration.Most of the text lays out a plan for a stable world government. This comes across as overly simplistic, as wishful thinking. It offers a very human concept of utopia, not a divine plan. It covers the superficial requirements for world peace, but does not offer any substantial spiritual instruction to get us there.I think there may be some level of divine inspiration behind this book, but it appears that a good deal of it was filtered through Mr. Walsch's personal opinions and limited perspective."
5,Amateur Novelist vs. Spiritual Guidance,"""An Encounter with a Prophet"" by C.A. Lewis is a good introduction for fundamentalist Christians who are just beginning to get in touch with gnawing concerns about their lack of spiritual fulfillment and the fear-based motivation of their belief system, and who are beginning to doubt that Satan is lurking behind every door.Walsch, on the other hand, will appeal much more to non-fundamentalists, or to those have already addressed those basic shifts in mindset (if they came from a fundamentalist background) and are looking for deeper answers.These two works address very different audiences, depending upon your current level of spiritual awareness."
2,"I'll have all the answers and a side order of fries, please.","I must admit that there are some portions of this book that ""FEEL"" like truth to me. But FEEL is the key word here. Like most people, I seek to know the truth about God and have searched down the various avenues of Christianity and other religions out there. But I cannot believe that FEELINGS dictate truth. Nor do I believe that suddenly, after thousands and thousands of years of human existance and human searching, God would suddenly ""Tell-all"" regarding universal questions. It's a drive-thru mentality, and I think people need to be wary while reading this book. This book justifies our lack of structure and our desire to not have to do ""what we're told"". It provides an alternate and wide path instead of the straight and narrow. This book is thought-provoking, yes. But I think there's more truth in the saying ""If you think it's too good to be true, it probably is."""
4,Acknowledgement,"I wish to express that I feel grateful with the teachings of the book. None of the items depicted here can be learned overnight, but the value of the book relies on the fact these are teachings for the whole life."
5,This is my favorite book!,"I have been through Book One several times (I have both the book and the CD collection). More than any book I have ever read, this work provides answers to a multiplicity of difficult questions. I view myself as functioning at a higher level ever since first reading the series three years ago. I had an opportunity to ask Deepak Chopra, live on PBS, his opinion of this book; his answer: ""Truly channeled directly from God!"" The quality of the CD set is excellent. The choice of Ed Asner and Ellen Burstyn was inspired (Ellen never ceases to amaze). This set is a good investment since many people are likely to want to hear the entire book repeatedly!"
5,"A Contemplation About ""Conversations.""","This is a masterpiece in modern thinking! As I listened to this book I finally realized that I was not the only person who found the little faults in human thinking and behavior, organized religion and government. The philosophies put forth in this book reflect exactly the philosophies of the common person but with one difference...the common person can feel it and act upon it but Mr. Walsch puts it into words for the first time. I have recommended this book time and time again to others and every time I get the same response...I thought I was the only one! I recommend this book highly to anyone who has an interest in living a correct life and has questions that you instinctivly know the answer to but want some kind of confirmation. Good reading!"
2,"Another regurgitating, money making machine on humanism","Anything goes spirituality.......Just like every other spiritualist guru Oprah promotes: I'm alright, your alright, we're all alright. I'm a god, your a god, we're all are own gods,...collectively. yuk yuk"
5,A Broadening Experience,"This book is a broadening experience. It will enhance your idea of God and of your relationship to God. It does discard some traditional religious mythology: original sin, hell, the devil, and the last judgment, but much of what it retains would be acceptable to religious thinkers as varied as Jesus, Moses, Buddha, Thomas Aquinas, William Blake, and Bernard Shaw. Perhaps you will object to some things God reveals to this author, but a major tenet of the book is that you not simply accept what has been passed onto to you by another, but that you converse with God yourself.The book does contain some repetition, an occasional lapse in grammar, perhaps even an inconsistency or two, but these are a small price to pay for so much that is of value. Walsch's God is more than eclectic. S/he is all embracing, reconciles, for example, creationism and the big bang. You will put the book down, feeling better about yourself, your purpose, and your God."
2,God must be American...,"I couldn't relate to this book. If God were talking & wanted the 'world' to read his book ..he'd have given examples that touched a chord with all humans.Seems to me that he speaks Enlish, follows american politics ...and just about everything else falls in to 'eastern theory' or 'eastern mystics'..he should know theres no east ..theres India, theres China, theres Japan..they all have their distinct philosophies.I am pretty certain if God were talking I'd be able to relate to him...Unless of course God wrote this book for Americans...maybe theres book 6 or 7 for the rest of us."
1,English clearly isn't God's first language,"The confused, inarticulate ramblings of a poor deluded charlatan. The chutzpah is staggering. Will sell and sell."
4,Not Up To No. 1 or No.3,"This is an interesting book that raises a lot of spiritual and moral questions about the world and society in which we live.A though-provoking book, I confess I didn't find it as relevant or stimulating as Book 1 or Book 3, these seem to have more of a personal focus."
3,Interesting,"I had mixed feelings about this book. I feel it has some genuine messages, but there is a flavour to the book that makes me ask the question of how this really came about. Nevertheless it has some very good points. I think the most profound is that what you fear you attract. This is confirmed by ACIM as well as in many other works. But to get to the point where we are living in constant joy and creativity and never ending experiences of total fulfillment need to be approached with caution. There are many steps in between to get to that point. It can be a very rocky road along that journey path and we need to understand that that road needs to be taken in order to achieve this bliss.Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
4,Inspirational,"What is so good about this book is not that it gives you anything new but that it tells you what you already know. The problem is that we have grown accustom to either ignoring or not acknowledging the obvious signs of GOD speaking to us. Whether you believe that what happened to Walsch is real or not, the book serves as good wake up call for all of us to listen to our inner voices and acknowledge that voice as a blessing!"
1,Another author out to make a buck and justify being selfish,"Scary stuff. God doesn't care what you do? Am I going to believe what one guy writes out of his head compared to the bible that has 60 some books by various authors written over hundreds of years and it all ties together? Do your research and you will see which is based on fact, not someones empty conversations with himself. If you want reality and facts consider getting ""The Case For Christ"" by Lee Strobel or ""Know Why You Believe"""
1,Are we to believe that God is a Marxist?,"Walsch's premise that we should return to spirituality and forget about religion (especially organized religion) make sense, but his ""conversations"" regarding homelessness, the rich, and ""equality for all"" regardless of effort lead us to believe that God was having serious ""conversations"" with Karl Marx. It's a shame that this book deteriorates into socialist propaganda. Bill Clinton doesn't ""care"" about health care for all, only about making the non-producers in our society believe that he does! Don't waste your money!"
1,Wrongly claiming to speak for God is destructive.,"An author has the right to share his or her opinion on anything. But claiming to speak for God is destructive, in that it can lead those unknowlegeable about our Creator to wrong assumtions.The reason this book is so popular is that it says what people want to hear (even if it's a lie). With statements like, ""There is nothing to forgive"", this book tries to eliminate the concept of sin and what is right or wrong.There is a book that speaks for the true God. It's called the Bible. It tells us of a loving, caring and patient God who wants to keep us from destructive behavior. But He is also a just God who warns us that we will all one day be held accountable for all we do, whether good or bad. And that He sent His only son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life."
1,This book is pure evil ....,"I bought this book a couple of years ago, because of the title. I only had to read about 20 pages to realize that this is the work of Satan, heresy. It was so repulsive to me I threw it in the garbage. It will no doubt be a comfort to those who choose to ignore God's Word and those who subscribe to the philosophy of ""anything goes"".What a frightening thought that this book is given to our children. But, not surprising, it's just another attack against Christianity. I am now reading the book by Dinesh D'Souza, 'What's So Great About Christianity' which I highly recommend. If you choose to read 'conversations' do so, and then read D'Souza's book.To sum it up, this man who hears voices in his head and thinks they are the words of god is disturbing."
1,Fast food religion that doesn't make the grade,"He writes well and has some good things to say, but his fundamental theology has much to be desired. None of his positive insights are anything new -- his loving God is described with much greater eloquence in the New Testament. By the middle of the book he goes beyond a loving God and shows his true colors -- describing an entirely new theology which I found fundamentally unsound and even distateful. Why read this garbage when the greatest work of all can be found in the New Testament of the Bible -- found in any bookstore? Don't take my word for it - the Bible has converted untold billions of individuals over the course of almost 2000 years. If this many people have found truth in the Bible, maybe it contains a spiritual truth worth considering. On the other hand, if CWG is around in 10 years I will be suprised."
5,The search for who and why am I.,"Ouspensky wrote, that our thoughts come up from the dark-deep floating as an air bubble to the surface. We don'tknow what they contain until surfaced. For the greaterpart, we don't control which thoughts surface nor how longthey tarry. I agreed and espoused the hypothesis untilhaving read this book. Those little bubbles now haveprofiles. They have personality. They choose when tosurface and when to lift from it like a bubble bursting.Upon reading this book, my relationship with the thoughtswhich stream through my mind is crystal clear. My relationshipwith God is clearer. My relationship with you, the readeris better understood. I have learned, from reading this book,how to watch those thoughts arise and word them correctly,before acting upon them full heartedly. A charm."
4,The most intellectual of the three books,Book 2 was the driest of the three books by Walsch. I loved all three though with 1 and 3 being my favorite. I keep Book 1 by my bed and read from it daily and I have Book 3 on tape and play them daily in my car. Thank you for the courage it took to write these and make them public. I am moved to write music from the text and the inspiration from your messages. The world is missing music which inspires the awesomeness of human beings being the creation of God - as we are - nothing wrong here. Thank you.
5,A journey into the meaning of life,"This book will change your life. It needs to be read and digested slowly. There are many ideas upon which to discover. The index includes a wonderful reference. This book changed my life. It gave me the guidance to follow my own spiritual journey. It will do the same for you, if you are open to it."
1,Not in God's Word!!,"Yes, God is a loving, merciful and gracious God - but this book has little to do with what God actually says in His word. I believe the book to be demeaning and simple minded to what God has already said in His Word. There are no mysteries revealed in this book as many have said in their reviews. For anyone who really questions what God would say - READ His word, not some man's version of what he thinks that God would say. The author's answers have little to do with what - again - God has already said in His Word. When some had said that they had a vision of a cruel, unloving and judgmental God, these characteristics are not of God but of a man. I urge them to actually have a conversation with God and to get to know God for themselves - not through man."
1,We gave this one away - would not recommend,"After reading part of book 1 we gave all three volumes away to the counselor who recommended them. It was just too depressing to think of reading beyond the first book. which we comment as follows on it ""This book was recommended by a counselor. However, for both myself and my wife we found it really out there. Actually it was rather depressing. We bought ours used and it was inscribed to someones mother; however, I could not imagine anyone giving this to a loved one. You would be much better off reading the Dali Llama or Bible for inspiration. My wife read me a couple of pages and I found the book rambling, boring, self-centered, and depressing."""
2,Beware!!!,"I've just started to get really into religion and I was searching for some books; this is what I found. I read the book, and it really effected my head! I was left in a state of confusion and doubt. As soon as I thought I felt my faith getting stronger, I read this book and it all changed. I did not know what to believe. For instance, Neale writes that God told him there is no such thing as the devil or hell, and people like Hitler make it into heaven. But I cannot understand this because how can you explain demonic possessions, which are indeed true? There are many (and I mean many!) cases like this where I was left soooo confused! I truly believe Neale was hearing this stuff, but I don't think it was God; just voices in his head. If you read this BEWARE because if you read to deep, it will effect your spiritual side. You've been warned."
5,"Oh, so thats who has been talking to me all these years.",Thanks to the Wisdom Channel I saw Donald Walsch's interview and heard about CWG. I have read I and II and have just started on III. I have for many years written in my journal but have not always understood what I was writing. I now reveiw those journals and understand who was often moving my pen. I also understand what my pen was writing. Thank you Mr. Walsch for this book that has taught me to LISTEN and to understand. Retired in Mexico
3,Ho Hum,"Why did this book not blow me off my feet? I already follow many of the ideas that the book attempts to succinctly explain. I do have discrepancies with the explanations Neal presents, yet ultimately the book tells one that one can be what one wants to be and create the life that one wants to create. Don't expect to be given anything on a plate.Take ownership of your own life and live positively. It may challenge many of your beliefs, but why not?"
1,Absolute Nonsense,"A silly, hucksterish collection of nonsense. A lot of tautologies, rainbows and unicorns. The one thing I do believe is that this guy was in marketing before he wrote this New Age claptrap. I'm throwing it in the trash, a better ending than it deserves."
1,... If this is God... God is a boring idiot,"There are actually many books like this out there, but this has the catchiest title for sure. We can all have conversations with our ""higher selves"" but its very hard not to inject your own personality and beliefs into the writing. . Even is this is God, its God interpreted through the authors' personality and philosophy. He gets to ask God 10 questions and the questions are self-absorbed and trivial. I would think God would say ""Are you sure you don't have better questions for God than this?"""
1,Not worth the money!,When I ordered this book it said it was in great condition. The book had writing all over the cover! I won't trust this site again!
1,Feel good spirituality,"Like the title of my review states, this philosophy being preached by Walsch is one of purely feel good spirituality. Do whatever you want, there are no consequences. Don't dare condemn another's choices or your own because that will limit us in our pursuit of self-made ambitions and the sole focus on ourselves and who we want to be in life. Because after all, it is all about us and our happiness. Again, there are no consequences so who cares. Oh yeah, and there's no right or wrong. So go ahead and do whatever feels good. It's all relative.Sarcasm aside, I could not disagree more strongly than I do with Mr. Walsch and his books. I firmly believe that truth is *not* relative, that there is a right and wrong and that a truly loving God has already revealed his heart to us in a little book called the Bible. And in that book there are consequences for our actions as humans. But, I'm guessing that wouldn't fit too well in a purely feel good faith."
1,not a Christian book,"This book presents a lot of interesting and engaging ideas. However, it is not a Christian book. Much of the theology is directly taken from New Age philosphy. Many points were made such as:a)there is no right or wrong.b)the Bible is not an authoritative source of truth.c)people are continually reincarnated.etc....God is a God of unconditional love, yes. He will take back anyone who desires to and makes a choice to accept Him as Lord and Savior. But He also has standards for living, not based on ""your Highest and Clearest thought.""quite an interesting read."
1,Good ideas wrongly expressed,"Those ideas expressed in the book might have some validity, but are expressed in a wrong way. If the author really meant to have talked with God, he needs some professional help, I guess. But I think the author is trying to sell his atheist philosophy to those Christian believers. If that's the case, he might deserve a higher ranking. What his book shows is that God wants us to believe that He does not exist and we humans create Him. Actually I am reading another book, in which the author claims ""Gods 'R Us"". He is a very good story teller, and also very good at convincing us that we are ourselves gods. He claims that through Virtual Reality and teleoperation, we humans can re-create the whole universe, which he calls ""new genesis"". A very enlightenning book in deed. Title: ""Get Real: A Philosophical Adventure in Virtual Reality""."
5,AWESOME!,"I was a born again Christian in high school , but a lot of the things I was tought made me FEAR God, not love him. For almost two years I struggled with trying to force myself to love God, even though I was so afraid, but my gut kept telling me to stop. I was searching for answers to questions I needed to ask, but I whom could I ask besides God?! It was then that I found this book. After reading the first chapter I was crying from joy, because I had realized that the God I had been fearing loved me, and was LITERALLY a part of me. I realized that all those ""little voices"" in my gut was God trying to tell me something. Everytime I smile, I feel God smiling with me. :) Thank you God! :)"
1,conversation with GOD ? it is an insult to almighty GOD !,"conversation with GOD ?it is an insult to almighty GOD !HYPE !SCAM !False Prophet ! Deceiver !Be ware for your soul is dangerfirst commandment >>>Money and fame can't bring you to heaven !!! only to HELL ....!choose to get away from true ,won't give you real happiness .....this book is a textbook for Psychology course .how people be cheated and deceived easily !This book should change name to conversation with Satan ....volume one !You are talking with your self-deluded idol God !"
1,Beware,"I read all three of these books and they helped lead me down a dangerous New Age road of SELF. Whatever ""entity"" inspired Walsh to write these books offers something remarkably similar to the offer presented to Eve in Genesis."
5,The most amazing book I've read in my 26 years of life!,Everyone must read this book! It is absolutely amazing. It is a book I will keep by my bedside for years to come and re-read it over and over again. I can't wait to tell all my friends and family about it!
5,This book makes more sense than anything that I've ever read,"At age 32 and being of sound mind and judgement (a graduate level engineer), I had come to my own conclusions about life, afterlife, God and ultimate reality and consciousness. Then I ""stumbled"" onto Conversations with God, book I. Not only did it say everything that I had already come to ""feel"" on my own, but it filled in all of the missing gaps and put everything together in such a coherent and sensible way as to truly be divinely inspired.I am a firm believer in what is said in these books. Be the knowledge directly from God herself or from the brillant mind of Neale who so elequently summarized the complex interactions of life, afterlife, and everything inbetween. I could not help but believe that it is divinely inspired. I have now read all 3 volumes multiple times and I will continue to read this ""bible"" forever."
5,This book saved my life,"If you go into this book with an open mind and heart, it will truly change your life and your way of thinking. I highly recommend it. Even if you don't believe that God spoke with the author directly, the ideas and concepts make so much sense and truly work, and you can apply it to your own life in every way. Loved it!!"
1,CONVERSATIONS WITH SATAN IS MORE LIKE IT,"I believe someone was conversing with the author, but it certainly wasn't the God I have come to know and love. To learn the truth about Him, I would recommend reading the Bible. To learn the truth about Satan, read this biography."
1,if only we had a negative scale.,"I'd rank this negative 1 if I could simply because this is New Age mixed in with ""Christianity"" and other opinions/beliefs. If your beliefs lie with what is written in the Bible then you won't have much use for this book, I sure didn't. I've had the chance to read this book and several others and they contradict what's in the Bible. For example in one of them the author talks about reincarnation, and of course people don't live many lives like this author claims they do. So its very New Age."
1,WALSCH IS AN AGENT OF EVIL! BEWARE OF HIS SATANIC BOOKS!!,OUTRIGHT LIES AND FABRICATIONS! WHAT A WAY TO MAKE A FEW DOLLARS: BLASPHEMING THE LORD! HELL AWAITS HIM!! AVOID THIS BOOK OR YE TOO SHALL SUFFER THY SAME FATE! THE ONLY BOOK ANYONE NEEDS IS THE HOLY BIBLE!!! JESUS IS LORD!!!!
1,An alarming fiction posing as an inspired work.,"For those of us in Oregon, Neale Donald (aka Bob White, radio persona) is no stranger. We listened to his criticisms for a number of years on the radio. We heard all of what he has written before. There really aren't many new revelations here. I suspect he actually asked questions then listened to some old tapes of his program and wrote down his own words as answers. His words are still as convaluted and circluar as they were before he wrote them down. The frightening thing is that so many are taken in by a doctrine which says there is no wrong and then states that it is wrong to eat meat, to smoke, etc. Neale, (Bob) make up your mind, please."
1,Say what?,"Your pen starts moving on its own and tells you it's God and you believe it? Are you kidding me? Gullible much?If there is a God, then this isn't Him. If there is a Satan, then he's definitely a ghost author here.Even with an open mind, this book killed more brain cells than I could afford. God already wrote a love letter that explains His heart. It runs from Genesis to Revelation. Check it out some time."
2,An American God?,"I bought and read Book 1, and thought it an excellent, provoking book. I could be convinced that the author may genuinely be in contact with God. As an Agnostic, I like these kind of books. However, book 2, although interesting, put me off, because of the constant references to America, what a great place it is, etc. After all, everybody knows that God is English!"
5,Stunning Heresy,"Absolutely amazing heretical stuff here. Always mix truth in with fiction--as Hitler said: ""The bigger the lie, the more folks will believe it"". Walsch has wonderful ideas about how to deal with fellow man--love--acceptance--all that--People everywhere could do well to listen. Don't know who the ""God"" is that he's talking to, but I DO know who he's NOT. He's NOT the God of Abramham, Issac, Jacob and Father of Jesus of Nazareth. Way cool if you're into reading heresy....way cool"
2,oversimplification of life,"I am a former devotee of this series. I suffer from anxiety and depression, two closely related conditions where the sufferer inevitably focuses on the negative. Thus, telling someone in this condition that they ""create their own reality"" is a terrifying prospect. I tried to ""choose differently"", I ""talked to God"", meditated, you name it. In the end, I still had the condition. I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. Terrified of the power of my negative thoughts caused by my illnes, which I could not simply ""snap out"" of, I was finally forced to abandon the books. While thought provoking, Walsch presents what is at best a vast oversimplification of the complexities of life. Walsch, despite what he claims, knows nothing more than any of the rest of us do. We, not others, are the highest authorities on our own truths."
1,No stars- hogwash.,"The author uses every logical trick in the book to try to present his view of being a chosen ""Master"", but the bottom line is that you must just accept on faith what he says. His conversation is an insult to any reader."
4,A Must Read for those on a Spiritual Quest!,"I have been on a spiritual quest for years now...always praying, talking to God, writing in journals, writing articles, essays, devotional poems, short stories and novels of faith, hope, love & happy-ever-after ~ although many say HEA isn't possible.To those skeptics I say, ""Oh yes it is! It's all in the choices you make, the dreams you dream, the thoughts you think, the words you speak and the actions you take!""Conversations with God is just one of the books I've read that confirm what I believe and have been saying!This one too, is a keeper.Pamela S Thibodeaux, Author""Inspirational with an Edge!"" (tm)"
4,Conversations with God,"the book is really great, came in perfect conditions.it was on time, i didn't take so long.good experince...Conversations With God: An Uncommon Dialog, Vol. 3"
3,Nice Book,"This book was ok... a little hard to follow at times, as it went on and on. Would have like to ask more questions of why this or that."
1,Sense and sensibility,"I hurried to buy CWG 2 and 3 after I read the first which I enjoyed. CWG carries no facts, no truths, no sense, and much less sensibility. I am a world traveller - and reading this during my journey makes me airsick !"
1,Theology for the gullible,"This is a truly foolish book that purports to answer the ""big"" questions about life and God, while ignoring the Bible and the divinity of Jesus. Mr. Walsch will, no doubt, find a large number of devotees, much the same way that Shirley MacLaine found those souls searching for meaning, when she attempted to become a spiritual guru. Both are just peddling recycled gnosticism, mixed with pagan influences and some Christianity thrown in the mix, as well, which is the heart of the ""new age"" movement. I know of what I speak because I previously adhered to occult/new age beliefs before being shown the truth of Jesus Christ as our savior. Here's a tip: read your Bibles before creating your own theology."
1,Whew!,"I thought I was not being of my usual open minded self until Istopped by here. I have read many many books on spiritual growth. Ilooked forward to settling down with Conversations With God and learning more about our relationship with God. It had been on the top best selling list for a long time, so it had to be great... right? All I need to say is that I never got past about the 20th page. And I tried twice thinking maybe I missed something."
1,Plagarizes another book,"Please do not buy this book. Parts of this book is so eerily similar to Shakti Gawain's ""Creative Visualization"", published in 1978, that it borders on plagarism. For example, Gawain has a chapter titled, ""Being, Doing and Having"" and Walsch also talks about being and doing on p.170. Gawain p.6: ""When we create something, we always create it first in thought form."" Walsch p.74: ""Thought is the first level of creation."" Gawain has a chapter on contacting your higher self which Walsch says in his book as ""your Highest Thought about yourself."" There are too many similarities to mention. The concept of oneness which is not new at all. In Hinduism, the universe is God, the One is the All. I suspect Walsch has borrowed many of his principles from other new age books and established religions as well. This book is obviously marketed to those with very little Eastern and New Age exposure."
1,There at it again!!,"Spiritually lost and desperate? deluded by self - centrism? duped followers? dimwits? marginally literate?. There at it again. 2000 years ago, these same guys would have fed everyone that gave this book a good review, to the lions.I was a Pentecostal for nine years and I can assure you they have no where near the brilliant answers presented in this book.Neale has brought us an invaluable gift and I wish this book is read by everyone on this planet with an open mind. I love the trilogy and will endeavor to put its teachings into practice.May Neale become very rich for this work he has brought to us. I give these books a fabulous five stars."
1,Should be called Conversations with Screwtape.,"I was given this book as a gift, and after getting about 1/2 way through it, realized that if the author was indeed truthful about having a real, super-natural experience, that it's certain that the impersonator of God was ""you-know who..."" I'd recommend the curious to read C.S. Lewis' ""The Screwtape Letters"", in order to fully understand ""Conversations with God"". I'm sure Amazon will get it to you in a couple of days...."
5,Divinely Beautiful,"I love this book, it infuses peace.I have the audio version which I listen to over and over because it's inspiring. Just when you start getting bogged down by something, Conversations with God offers so many tips on how to jump over any hurdle--and have fun doing it!"
5,You will cry tears of joy,"This book changed my life, assisting me in understanding the nature of God and His/Her Universe, and the purpose of this existence. I cried within the first 20 pages as the truth filled my soul. After reading the entire book, I felt a sense of peace and calm in my being. The ""shackles of lies"" had been removed from my understandings. You will finally know the meaning of the saying...""and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free"". One Love"
5,"Thank, you God...","...For Your Conversations with Neale Donald Walsh! You got our attention and we heard Your message loud and clear. This book has become a mini-bible for me with truths and wisdom that I can reach out and grab a hold of and bring it into my daily life. I 'happened' on CWG at an airport bookstore and as I began to read it, my life started moving in a new direction. I took this book everywhere with me until I finished it. I could barely put it down. God explains to us secrets of life, death and the universe in simple terms. This is a most fascinating dialogue. I ordered and read Books 2 and 3 and plan to read them all again many times."
3,How does it make you feel?,"I've read the book and the editorials here. They really mimic the book, in that each reader will find his/her own path via the way they feel, if they truly listen to their feelings. The way it made me feel, after going to Baptist school from grade shcool through highschool, and living in fear and guilt for the past 15 years was to face exactly who I Am and What I Wanted To Be. I found a God of Love and He is me. Mr. Walsh is just a messenger, you will notice that after reading this book, you will see the messages everywhere (seek and you will find) and the message is simple: that is God is Love. To the doubters, I find it interesting that Christ forgave the very persons who crucified Him. If he forgave them they did not go to 'hell', do you think for a minute, that He is going to send us into damination?"
4,"Not sure of format, but liked the content very much.",The book was filled with valuable insight. It's the type of book you will want to read many times.The format was a little hard to believe. Only because the author seemed to be such a screw-up. I felt as though the reader was being manipulated. It was not sincere.
1,Drivel,"Read the ""Acknowledgments"" pages. Here he blows kisses to pop-religionist Terry Cole-Whittaker, then ends by finding God in the ""inspirational art"" of John Denver and Barbara Streisand, no less. I guess Mozart, Shakespeare, Michelangelo and company are pikers by his standards. Still, I started reading, incredulity growing with every page. This is a man with an AGENDA. It is simply wrong (God would say sinful) for Walsch to present idiosyncratic thinking as words from the highest source. He created a nice little industry for himself, nothing more."
1,Shame on Oprah - but who is surprised,This book should be a disgrace to Evangelical Christians. Wouldn't hurt for others to be offended also. It is so unBiblical in it's answers.Shame on Oprah.
5,great book,"I have been reading this book off and on for about a year now and i think it delivers a great idea about who we are and what we can make of our selves. For the people that claim this to be the word of satan, your missing the message here. Everything is based on our own perception, almost like ""what the bleep do we know"" when it states that we create our own reality based around our thoughts and ideas. After all the bible was only guide of messages and thoughts and so is this book and NDW also sates in the book that not everyting is entirely true. So anyone interested in this book...BUY IT! dont bother with what anyone is saying about it and make up your own mind. The only reason people are claiming this to be satans work is because they are afraid of change and afraid of progress. read this book as a message....not literaly"
1,Useless Garbage,"I tried to like this thing, I really did. I listened to it with an open mind. Three things that didn't mesh with me:1. There is no right or wrong2. There is no Hell3. Because there's no Hell Hitler is in HeavenIf the Bible talks about Hell why didn't the author inquire more on this important fact to God?Like many have said, this guy heard what he wanted to hear."
1,Factual mistakes and circular logic,"This is a book filled with factually incorrect sophmoric ideas about social issues, supported by what is often circular logic. It is difficult to believe that this poorly written, intellectually childish book is the work of the almighty. Oh well, the Lord works in mysterious ways."
1,Not what I expected,BEWARE!! I thought by the title of this book it would be wonderful and written in a way that God would answer. It is the OPPOSITE of such a thing. If you have the simplest knowledge of the Bible you will quickly see that this book seems to LEAVE OUT biblical principles and in many cases is CONTRARY to the Bible. BEWARE!!
4,Intriguing Ideas,This book has a very interesting point of view about God and our relationship with Him. It had some points that have kept me thinking and wondering for weeks. Could be interesting to most faiths.
4,Great Book,This book has truly enlightened me. It has allowed me to see things in a whole new light.
5,An excellent read for people of faith who question religion.,"Some people think Walsch's book is offensive. I think its inspirational. So many of Walsch's questions and frustrations, hopes and fears were my own. More than any other vision of God, the one in this book makes sense. It just feels true. If you like Max Lucado--you'll love Conversations With God. Reading it can help bring you closer to God--no matter how far away you've been. Five stars is not enough for a book that can change your life."
2,Seeking advice,"A devout Christian friend of mine told me that this book is basically ""Christian Scientology"". I'm still learning when it comes to all this stuff - can someone clear this up for me? Thanks"
5,Must Read for Spiritual Seekers,"A profound book by any standards. It succeeds in synthesizing the essence of great philosophical and religious thought in an easy read, and eliminating the man-made aspects of power and control that degrade most religions. That it includes elements from Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity only reflects that indeed all is connected to one God whose message has always been one of love and compassion. The fact that it threatens and upsets the anti-New Agers and the self-righteous Christian lot points to its essential truthfulness - whether you believe the words are from God or not. It seems that those who preach fear and hate for their own selfish purposes are now themselves in fear of the spiritual truth Walsh and others are bringing the planet at this critical time in history. But it's OK - God loves all even if his name and message have been twisted for lowly gain. This book is another step in helping us attain a global consciousness that brings us closer to Him."
2,We've heard it all before,"I have read all of the CWG books, and must say that I did not find anything in there that I had not read or heard before. I found it interesting that traditional ideas which have stood the test of time were casually dismissed, while every new-age idea was endorsed and embraced (with the exception of pyramid power-I did not see that in his books I must confess.) The author is well versed in eastern religions and metaphysical thought. His ideas are thought worthy, but I feel I must caution readers who are seekers not to accept everything in this book as ""Truth."" Mr. Walsch does admit that he is an imperfect ""filter."""
1,What was I thinking!!!,"I believe that Neale Walsch really did hear a voice, but of what spirit, who knows?! It definitely was not GOD! I must say that this book was rather powerful enough that it actually shook my faith in the Bible for a little while. I was so disturbed by it that I thought the best thing I should do was to pray about it. Well, GOD always lead me back to the Bible. He had answered my prayers. I threw away ""Conversations with God"" book I and II both in the trash."
4,Neale Diamond Walsch,"I love the books, conversations with God. I don't think these cd's are necessarily an acceptible substitution, but it's nice to be able to listen as you go. Thus, it helps to set your expectations accordingly. I mean, hardly anything is ever as good as the book. I happen to agree with one other reviewer about the movie, very inspiring-it reminded me of my own story and motivated me to continue on my quest.I also prefer the author to use their own voice, thus give this one less star than it would otherwise command. One of the quotes I like the best is ""Today's reality is a result of yesterdays thoughts about it"". This is good food for thought and challenges the reader/listener to begin takign responsibility for what they are thinking, saying, and doing. I definitely integrated this concept into my book ""Reality Creation 101""."
1,It's completely unbiblical!,"This book is the complete opposite of what God really says! Neale Walsch is basically claiming to be a prophet through whom God speaks. But his ""answers"" to questions are not anywhere near what the Bible says. For example, he praises homosexuality and premarital sex, but in the Bible they're both sins. Also, in Galatians 1:6-8 it says, ""I am astonished that you are so quickly desserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel - which is really no gospel at all. Evidentally some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned."" God's saying here that he's not going to send anyone since Jesus to give us more insights into God's heart. That includes Mr. Walsch."
1,unbiblical garbage,"The feel good generation is at it again. You can't do anything wrong. Perfect book for our humanistic, politically correct society. Mr. Walsch, that was Satan answering your questions."
1,Conversations With Who?,"People will read anything disguised as ""intelligent and open minded."" Makes me want to write ""Conversations With the Devil"" - believe I'll get started!"
2,.Where is my second book.,"I ordered 2 of these books in error, however, the mistake was good. The problem is that I only received 1 book. Both charges were taken from my account"
3,Oops He Did It Again !,"Once again Walsch allows himself to mar a fairly insightful treatise on the nature of God and the state of mankind with a silly speculation about alien intervention in the affairs of earth people. He asserts that the rapid advances in technology of the last hundered years were achieved with the assistance of extraterrestrials! This type of wild X-File theorizing - along with his utopian suggestions for economic and governmental reform - undermines his credibility as a theological and social thinker. This is regretable since many of his insights, especially on the nature of the political and economic structure of the nations of the world, are dead-on-target.Still, leftovers from CWG Part 1 such as his sophmoric wordplay and use of catch phrases (""unless it is/isn't"") are annoying. Overall, the book is entertaining and thought provoking. I'm looking forward to reading CWG Part 3 which I'm sure will be just as fascinating a mixture of sublime and ridiculous - Unless it's not."
4,Not sure if it's God,"I just finished reading this book, and although I really enjoyed it, I question whether he was really having a converation with God. Nearly every concept written in this book was written by Shirley MacClaine in her books ""Out on a Limb"" and ""Dancing in the Light"" more than 15 years ago, and in some cases, with even more clarity.I would be interested in knowing what Mr. Walsh has read. He indicates a number of readings throughout his book. I can't help wondering if his extensive reading influenced his ""conversations"" with God."
1,Bunch a' Hooey,This guy had a conversation alright but with whom? With himself? Or Satan? Probably the latter because he is the great deciever. And will truly try to subvert the true word of God if he can. If you are searching for answers look to the true word of God. The Bible is the word of God which this man contradicts throughout this book. I just pray the people who buy this book and are searching keep looking and find the Bible.
1,"""There is no such thing as right or wrong""","The most telling quote from the book, ""There is no such thing as right or wrong,"" and God is supposed to be saying it. If that is what you are teaching your kids, this book is for you. Otherwise, if you believe in morality, that some things are wrong, like killing or stealing, this book will undermine your parenting."
1,Are the voices in my head bothering you?,"Neale Donald Walsch proves once again that, while it does no harm to talk to one's self, it is most unwise to start answering.I would give him the excuse of cluelessness, except that he's proven most adept at that New Age alchemy of turning BS into gold. That takes business acumen, at least.Clueless are those who part with the latter to buy the former from Mr Walsch.Clap-trap."
1,Message: Oregon is Heaven on earth,"The Chinese translation of Walsch's book has just been published in Beijing by the government owned ""Friendship Publishing House"" and is selling well here as a critique of the Bible and Judaism/Christianity. If one wants an anti-religious book, fine, this is as good as any. But what was particularly galling about this one (at least in the Chinese translation) is the way that Walsh's wisdom is so heavily dependant on his relatively cushy environment. The message that ""this life can be paradise, man is God"" might be convincing for some in the quiet rural niche of Oregon Walsch has found, it would be considerably more convincing if it was written by someone in Bangladesh or Sierra Leone who has experienced some of the hell on earth this planet offers many of its inhabitants."
1,Good For Laughs,"This book was ridiculous. I found a contradiction or error in reasoning on nearly every page. I'm no language expert or anything, but I really am amazed at how many people missed Walsch's circular arguements and the way that he and ""God"" both wrote in the same manner. It is laughably obvious that Walsch had this ""life-changing"" conversation with his yellow legal pad and no one else."
5,A must read for the earnest seeker.,"Amazing. At last comes a book that spells out in clear language and without contradiction, the nature of physical ""reality"" in relation God and the soul, and the meaning/purpose of our existence here. After having read the Dhammapada, the Diamond Sutra, the Sutra of Hui Neng, the Vimalikirti Nirdesa Sutra, the Bhagavad Gita, two very thorough texts on the Kabbala, portions of the Christian Bible, the Ocean of Truth by Sri Sathya Sai Baba and myriad books by other spiritual teachers, this book is a relief, and truly a Godsend. You will acquire this book if it is your time to acquire this book."
1,Not in the least Biblical,"The concept of this book is interesting. The substance is scary, from a biblical viewpoint.If you want answers from God - read your BIBLE. It's all there."
5,I feel sorry for ctwink,"This reviewer subscribes to the kind of dogmatic, distorted and fear-based version of Christianity that Walsch exposes in this book, and is no `religion' that I would ever want to be part of.ctwink, you are a masochist, and you disgrace the memory of Jesus Christ with your hate-filled, closed-minded attitude.Walsch's book contains many profound truths, and is a true inspiration to read. As he says, it really does not matter whether or not you think the book is the word of God or not: it is the message that is important.What is the message of the Bible; obey or rot in hell? Give me a break."
1,God's humor needs work!!,"I find far more evidence of God's humor (and much more entertaining) in the natural world and in my own life than in this Book. I did find ironic humor in God ""saying"" in the book that the written word should be the least trusted. Lo and behold!! Another book! This book stresses the importance of individual experience and ""re-membering that the individual is God"". While this was a dialogue with the author's God, it was not a dialogue with my God. Mine, thankfully, did not wake me up in the middle of the night and demand that I begin taking shorthand. In sum, I would prefer to take The Bible to my desert island simply for the sheer breadth of story and room for interpretation"
5,Very much suggested book :>,"After you read the book, you will know how difficult it is to write a review for this book. To me it is a book of answers to questions in my life, and a starting point of a new life too. In this sense it is ""good"" to me :-)But be not led by any comments, and pick it up to read it to, maybe to me, page 30. You'll get it, or if not just put it down ^_^"
1,"""Here's your sign""","You don't have to read very far to see that the God Mr. Walschthinks he is talking with isn't the same God the Bible teaches usabout. If Mr Walsch really thinks God told him there is no such thing as right and wrong, maybe he, and anyone who rated this book a ""10"", should read the Bible a little closer. I seem to remember something about ""The Ten Commandments!"""
1,Sad,"This book is not about God, but about the enemy of God.2 Cor:13-15 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.Therefore it is no great thing if his (satan's) ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.This book will confuse those who do not know the Lord, but will not fool those who love Jesus Christ."
1,God has already spoken and all the answers you need...,"God has already spoken and all the answers you need are in the Bible. The Bible teaches that all those who do not trust in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior will be eternally separated from Him. I pray that you will look into the Bible for your answers and not the world.Key Facts About Eternity(1) Everyone will exist eternally either in heaven or hell (Daniel 12:2,3; Matthew 25:46; John 5:28; Revelation 20:14,15).(2) Everyone has only one life in which to determine their destiny (Hebrews 9:27).(3) Heaven or hell is determined by whether a person believes (puts their trust) in Christ alone to save them (John 3:16, 36,Cry out to Jesus and He will save you. The end as at hand.In Christ,Steve"
1,Read the excerpt before purchasing!,"This book doesn't even deserve one star, but that's the lowest rating I could give it. Just reading the excerpt above was enough to steer me far away from this book. The author claims to have been given a revelation from God that is more accurate than the Bible and urges us to go by our experiences and feelings rather than the Word of God. Christians, Beware!!!"
3,Conversations wtih God,"I read this book for my monthly book club. It definitely brought up several hours of dialogue. Though I do not necessarily agree with everything the Author stated, it did make me think about a lot of things. It touched several members in my bookclub and for some they felt it depended on your personal relationship with God. Some of us just choose to follow the Bible instead of this book. However, we can respect that this is how the Author felt the Lord was talking to him."
4,Are you talking with yourself?,"When this book was referred to me by a number of friends I thought that I should seriously read it. After reading it, I am deeply thankful I did - it completely didn't clear up anything. As eloquent as this book is and as much wonderful conversation Mr. Walsch has with God, life's mysteries are still mysterious.In confronting religion, I applaud the book's view - it is one that I subscribed to, which is to say religion shouldn't hold back your relationship with our heavenly Father (these are my thoughts and not the book's).Get your brain and think about this one. It will help mature your relationship with God and focus your energies in the right direction!"
1,God offers so much more than this book,"If you want to know the God who is crazy about you...loves you so much He sent His Son to die for you...order ""TrueFaced"" instead. This is NewAge fluff, none of it jives with the Bible."
1,This guy is a complete HYPOCRITE!!!,"I know the author and he is the most condescending, arrogant, and self centered person you will ever encounter. Anyone who has truly listened to God would never treat people the way he does. I am a seeker myself, so I definitely encourage you to look somewhere else for genuine teachings and inspiration. But please don't support this hypocritic and faith exploiter by buying his products."
1,horrible,"This book is a horrible abomination of what God really wants for your life. If you are drawn in by this book I assure you it is only satan who is ""seeking to devour you"". This book has very little biblical sounding and if you really long to have a conversation with God you should spend time in prayer and with the word of God not the words of Mr. Walsch who seems to have no concept of the nature of The God of Israel, Abraham, and Paul."
1,What is your choice?,"Can sheeps go where the sheepherder doesn't allow it to go?Before going onto the cross, Jesus also asked if that is what father really wants him to do. He got on there although he didn't want to do it.However, this book tells you to do whatever YOU wants to do and give you a belief system which YOU feel comfortable with instead of the father's.Are you sheep?"
1,Nausea,"I agree with the person who wrote 1 Star Too Many. I only read the excerpt, but this book is based upon automatic writing--an occult practice. How does the author (or for that matter the person who reads the book) know whether or not it is God who communicated with the author? I believe that the bible is the inspired word of God. The bible states in both the Old and New Testament that occult practices are an abomination to God. Is God now contradicting Himself? Conversations with God appeals to people who basically want to persist in their resistance to God's authority."
1,Dangerous and wrong,"I saw the power of the seductive untruths in this book destroy a woman I loved. I pray that no more of you succumb. This book is New Age nonsense inspired by a mishmash of eastern mysticism and godless universalism. It is inspired, I'll admit. Inspired by the thief that wants only to kill, to steal and destroy.You will only know the peace of God's will working through your life when you accept the truth that Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth and the Life and that not even one person comes to know or have a conversation with God but through Him.And to as many as believe, He offers the right and power to become the children of, not just conversant with, God. Get a good modern translation of the Bible if you want to know about God. Repent of your sins and turn your life over to Him if you want to know Him personally.He can't wait and there's nothing you've ever done that will disqualify you from His love."
1,Try another....,"A poor read. There are a few nuggets of commonlly accepted but overlooked or forgotten wisdom but for the most part is weak in its ability to really contribute anything of importance to solving any problems. This planet has big problems and science puts the rubber to the road in solving them... And it is not short lived in antedotal messages. Something I read in a huge online debate has always stuck with me when the assertion of any God is presented. It goes as follows: You've conjured up an illusion that appeals to your vanity. It appears as though Walsh has done this and profited immensly from it. I'm an Atheist but I found Pecks ""the road less travelled"" and ""people of the lie"" at least helpful and a great read. As well Carl Sagans books. There is also ""the lost art of listening"" by Nichols. These books are better how to books for improving yourself and the world you live in."
1,"Try ""HE AND I""","This book is only for people who believe they can live life doing anything they please and they'll still have a straight way to heaven. This book is full of untruths. I urge any of you searching for a book where the Lord truly speaks please try ""He and I"" by Gabrielle Bossis. It is a 5 star book where this is an elementary book of lies."
1,Conversations with God: An Uncommon Dialogue,"This book goes completely against God's teaching. It appeals to the ""now - ME "" generation but has little real truth except what the author says. The other books by this author reveal the same thing in that it applauds homosexuality and the ""if it feels right it must be right"" mentality of this broken world. This should be titled ""Conversations with satan"""
5,easy meaningful read,"I found Conversations with God an easy and intriguing read. The author's (God) ideas made me question and reflect on the guiding forces in my life. The idea that `God' is not making judgments, but human minds have constructed the idea of good vs bad, and right and wrong was provoking.I too believe that God speaks to all, but most(including myself), listen with our ears and minds, but not our hearts.The book introduced insights that were new to my mind. These ideas resonated; speaking to the unease that I indentlfy as the feeble human condition.The book was an easy and entertaining read, give it a try. The depth and wisdom of `God's' conversations with the author were validating to feelings that float slightly beneath the surface of consciousness.Again, give it a try."
4,Really Enjoyed it!,"I really enjoyed all the books in the series but the first was definitely my favorite.I like the way Neale made God a companion and friend.If you're really lucky, you can have conversations like this with God.thanks Neale.Averlyngenesisartline.com"
5,Walsch books offer hope for our planet.,"As I write this, I am eagerly awaiting the release of Neale Donald Walsch's next book...Communion With God on October 4. After reading the CWG trilogy and Friendship With God, I ""know"" this next volume will be just as exciting and wonderful!!! I don't quite know how to put into words what these books have meant to me in my life. Their message is so positive, uplifting, compassionate, courageous, and truthful that I am simply left shaking my head in amazement...:) I think if we ever needed to hear these words, this is the time. For so many years has the human race done all it can to destroy all that is truly sacred and beautiful about life. Perhaps now we can wake up and possibly rebuild some of this precious place we have always loved and called our home."
1,DISAPPOINTED IN CONDITION OF BOOK,"I purchased a book which was listed ""new condition"". The book had stains all over the cover and there were many, many hi-lited areas in red marker throughout the book. I'm very disappointed!"
5,Gets You Thinking,"This book helped me rediscover my love for God and life itself. I'd recommend it for anyone who wants to restructure his or her beliefs in a postive, healthy, and loving way."
4,More on God and equality,"Neale continues his ""conversation"" and shares his experiences with us. He writes about equality for us all and by this he means equal opportunity. Some of us take advantage of the infinite possibilities around us; however most of us do not. It seems we have been conditioned to look at life - and at God - as we have been taught.If we try to see from other perspectives, then we might be able to expand our awareness and enjoy life, because that is the purpose of life, to experience life in any way we choose. This is the beauty of free will - if we are open to this. If you are not open to new ideas and thoughts, then this book is not for you. Those who are open will find value within these pages as thousands already have."
5,This book will change your life for the better,"An amazing book! Plain and simple. This is the book I always meant to write. Within its pages are contained the truth about everything my heart and soul has yearned to say since I came here. As I was reading, I felt as if the words were my own. These are the truths I have known as a child and which were literally beaten out of me by a condemning and negative society. God is love. There really isn't much more that need be said. If we are all of God, that is, if we are all God...what then stands between us and being Love? Nothing but our choice. Choose NOW to be that which you know deep in your soul to be true. Be the Love! A must read. This will move and inspire you to new heights in your life. Don't miss this. Your soul brought you to this message and this book for a reason."
4,On the level,"As a person of the Catholic faith, this book raised quite a number of questions about who God really is. I was initially stunned at the fact that anyone (specifically Neale Donald Walsch) could talk to God. But if you take a step back from the book, it provides practical advise on day-to-day issues that people of all faiths can benefit from, without the need to destroy the core beliefs that religion instils in us all. If you have read this text and were not moved in the slightest, just remember that Jesus too was a radical and the Pharisees totally ignored him. Will you be one of those people?"
5,A Great Book !,"In ""Conversations with God"" Neale Donald Walsh shares his conversations that he had with God from the answers to his questions about his life while he was writing, and in the answers many clarifications are made about life. It's a great book to read, and it's nice to know that hell is not an actual place. That's comforting to know.Many topics are discussed, and the theme of this book helps us to live a better life here on earth. I enjoyed this book and think it can help more people if they are open to it."
1,Less than zero,"I am not surprised that this would be so wildly popular, I just look around and see this road map being used and promoted every day. Just as fortold, so many stray sheep. How normal, how sad. If you need more permission to live for yourself and push out any last childish guilts you may have, this is just the book for you. I love books and out of all the thousands I have read, this belongs at the bottom of the heap, never have I seen such well written trash."
3,as a grain of salt,"Those who know do not say, those who say do not know. Those reveiws claiming that this book contains the true and ultimate answers are full of it. If you want true knowledge, study all of the religeons with an open mind."
1,this is not biblical,"this is not biblicalplease check your bible and you will see that it is NOT what GOD has said or who HE is.please compare man's idea and what God actually said. read the bible in context, not just 1 verse.i pray that you will pass this information along so that GOD will be honored by yourstanding up for HIM. do not believe what this person has written....."
4,"Awesome information and hope for the next 1,000 years!","I thought that book one was interesting, but book two blew me away! So much of the information of Human Existance and Experience in book two really rings true with other information that I have been reading recently! I can't wait to get to book three. I would also recommend the Converstions woth God CD --- lovely and inspiring music!"
4,Take it for what it's worth,"Okay, I'm not really sopping with joy over the book, but I also believe that you have to take the information for what it is and not worry too much about whether it's actually ""God"" talking or not (of course it deals with this in the book!). It doesn't matter if the material comes from God or Walsch's imagination, take what you want and leave out the rest. Walsch asks some awfully stupid questions sometimes, however. For those of you who liked this book I would strongly recommend The Nature of Personal Reality by Jane Roberts. It is a channeled book as well, but with less interruptions, and a little more intellectual in its descriptions. What I liked best about Conversations is that it held a lot of truths I have read from other beliefs.. and that is usually what makes something ring true for me."
3,E pluribus unim,"As previously stated... There are many paths. For those who find insight in this book, congratulations. For those who didn't, you will find it elsewhere. Trust your choice, whatever it may be. And don't bother reading any of these reveiws ;-)"
1,not what i thought it would be,"this is not at all what i thought it to be. very disappointed and couldn't even force myself to finish reading the book. as a CHRISTIAN, i didn't find this book to be very CHRIST like at all and actually found way too many things in this book that went AGAINST what we're talk in the Bible.i do NOT recommend this book.xoxo, Christie"
1,Get Real,"This book should be titled ""Conversations with Satan"", because that is who this sadly misguided author was listening to. If you really want to know about God read HIS book, it's called the ""Holy Bible"" and not a book from someone who is just out to make a quick buck off of people desperate to hear the truth as long as it fits into what they want to believe. People don't want to be held accountable, they want to believe that everything is all right and it's someone else's fault. This is not what God teaches. I challenge you to get into His word if you want the honest truth."
1,Don't bother caring about anyone else,"I guess this book is mostly attractive to Christians who have never questioned what they've been taught all their lives, and lived in fear of a wrathful god, and suddenly they're hit with what must seem at first like a bit of fresh air. (I'm not a Christian, although I was raised as one, so I didn't have the positive reaction that so many people have had to this book.) I think my main gripe is the ""do whatever you want, other people don't matter"" philosophy Walsch espouses. I do not agree with the author that selfishness is the highest good--I feel that compassion is actually the essence of the best of human attributes. Where have I heard this line before...: ""The greatest among you shall be the servant of all,"" or words to that effect."
1,Conversations with God? Please don't make me laugh,"I can honestly say that this book just plays to anyone who is weak and searching for something to absolve them of their own guilt. TO say that God doesn't care what you do or how you live your life, is so absurd that only idiots would believe that. IF you are a christian then you should know that the Devil will lie and he knows the bible as good as the Lord himself. To me this is just another way to corrupt our youth and conflicted and floundering Christians. It isn't a shock that Oprah endorses this. Look at her connections. Isn't it convenient that she is behind Obama 100%? I hope that he doesn't listen to her in areas of spirituality or our whole country will be in peril. If you are truly looking for a good book to read read "" In the grip of grace"" by Max Lucado."
1,God according to a liberal!,"If you voted for Odumba, you will love this book!!! I did!... it gives me all the outs that organized religion never did... I can turn off my brain and still feel pacified by a God who agrees with me... it is much more easy than having to adhere to God!GREAT BOOK!... EASE OF USE!"
1,A Lie from Satan,Do not purchase this book. You will be feeding yourself and/or your children complete lies about God that Satan wants us to believe. It clearly condones sins and is NOT of God and conflicts with biblical truth!
1,If it would be possible to give negative stars I would.,"This book is really sad. I read it with as much of an open mind as I could, but I know in my heart that the Lord would not use inappropriate language of any kind, which is exactly what Mr. Walsch ""says"" that God said to him. By the way, this word used was in Chapter 4, page 88. I mean really, if that does not say to you that this book is a bunch of bologna, than I don't know what will. I do believe that Mr. Walsch believes that his ""conversations with God"" were straight from the Lord himself, but the truth is, they weren't. The Lord works in mysterious ways, but I know this is not one of them. Satan's dirtywork has corrupted the minds of the weak once again. Don't buy this book if you're curious, you won't find answers in it. Read the Bible, only there you will find answers. True answers."
4,Question Your Concept of a Higher Power,"An enjoyable, mind wringing book that makes one question his or her vision of a Higher Power. This book came along at a most opportune time in my life, when I was trying to decide what my understanding of my Higher Power was. So many of us accept the basic beliefs that are given to us by our parents, and rarely do we question these beliefs... but I guarantee that you would be asking some of the questions that the author asks ""him"" and you will be intrigued by ""his"" answers.One thing this book surely does is forces readers to accept responsibility for their actions, and for their perceptions of the events in their lives. If you are not ready to accept this type of responsibility (I was!), then you might not enjoy this book. But if you are prepared to be thoroughly honest with yourself, then this book may be helpful to you in gaining a better understanding of yourself and what ""God"" really wants for you in this life.Enjoy your journey!"
5,CWG Book 3 CD's,"So happy I bought these, perfect timing in my life, such wonderful thoughts and peace come to focus. Thanks so much."
5,God has a sense of humor and I now know him better; Superb!,"I read the soft copy before it ceased being published. This a one of the best books I have ever read and should be read by all searchers. We can know God and we can lead peaceful, joyful lives. Will be hard to wait for coming volumes. This book will surpass the Celestine Prophecy! Excellent"
4,God of Baby Boomers,"I found this book a fascinating read, but I don't believe - as the author contends - that this is actually the word of God. The author stipulates he is literally taking dictation for the Big Guy (in a very real sense, these are supposed to be new books of the Bible).I frankly would have gotten more out of the book if the ""interview"" style was used as a literary device instead of an honest-to-God (literally) conversation. It's quite an interesting book from a philosophical perspective, but from a religious standpoint, it's a bitcornball. The morals (or lack thereof) in the universe seem just a TAD convenient for what the boomer generation is hungry for (essentially, do what feels good - but, gosh, try not to hurt any of your fellow mother/father Gods in the process; and gobble up all themoney and sex that feels right for you). Long story short: I'd recommend reading this book, but I wouldn't convert your life (or any of the author's purported 648 lives) based on it."
1,One sick puppy.....,"You know, I first tried to read this book when it first came out and it offended me. Now all these years later, I picked volumes 1 and 2 up at my local library. Still feel the same way. There are so many wonderful sacred texts to read why would anyone waste their time with this? The real clincher for me came in volume two when he is discussing sex and children. And I quote: (Page 105)"" In some societies, parents couple in full view of their offspring-and what could give children a greater sense of the beauty and the wonder and the pure joy and the total okayness of the sexual expression of love than this?""This simply outrages me. This guy is one sick puppy."
1,"Answers that our world ""wants"" to hear...not the Truth!","The issue I have with this author is the obvious intent to deceive the potential readers into thinking this is based on Christian beliefs. And with young target audiences, it is very scary. This book is another ""new age"" individual belief system that is deceptively titled Conversations with God. It seems to support man's selfish viewpoint of tell me what I want to hear, rather than what is right. Living a life based on long-standing, steadfast beliefs is not easy in todays me-me-me world. This book is too accepting of any and all behavior and actually states there is no sin! While over 35,000 Christian religions have sprouted over the last 500 years, they have mostly been based on someone's interpretation of the Christian foundation of the Bible. Many of the ""answers"" provided in the book are totally opposite of what our Christian God teaches to be true. The title should at least be conversations with my god."
4,Why Not...,"I ask, Why not? Why couldn't Mr. Walsch have a conversation with God? Remember back to the old days; back when there were real survivors, God talked to everyone. But what does it take to talk to God? If this book, and the forty that follow give the answer, you need to be on your last leg. You need to be so far down; so desperate, so low that the ants look like angels; then you can strike up a conversation with the Leader. But wait, the books really are informative. The whole series gets better and better as you get into them. Do you have real, down-to-earth questions? These books give you, if not the dogma you may crave, a way of figuring out the answers for yourself. The problem is they pretty much put the burden back on you: Who are you? Who do you want to be? These are questions a lot of us don't want to ask, let alone answer. But the best part is the books show how to look at life without looking through the filters of church dogma. Enjoy, (signed, GOD)"
5,"Changed my outlook in life, completely!.","This book has taught me an absolute profound understanding of what life is all about. I now have become a very perceptive person on things in general and on decision I have to make down to menial ones. Miraculously, good things, beautiful things, happy things, lovely things have happened so far,and I feel so gratified to have discovered this book while visiting New York 2 years ago. This book really teaches you in simple language how one should look at life and I found real substance and not words where in the end, all forgotten as there was nothing really outstanding. I really thank you Mr. Walsch, as you are genuine and not one of those famous and frequent guests on talk shows. However, I watched you on Larry King but I wish it was for a full hour as I was just absorbing your every word. Thank you and stay genuine! . ........"
1,god small g,"This book should be called Conversations with the god of this world"" If ever there was the same old bombast by the adversary of the One True God-This is it. Don't waste your time. Read the first 3 chapters of the book of Genesis and you'll get the idea."
1,Give Me A Break!,"As a seeker of truth, I read Mr. Walsch's book with an open mind and heart... looking for something great. Unfortunately, what I found was much half-truth and new age hype. I did not give this book a second thought until I read the reviews on Amazon.com. My concern is the number of readers that feel this book is such a revelation.... This reveals that so many are indeed suffering... no ""starving"" for inner truth. Mr. Walsch has appealed to our need for self forgiveness... to our inner pain. Unfortunately there is no ""easy path"", no ""quick fixes"". Please don't waste your money on this book! Start first with ""A Road Less Travelled"" by M. Scott Peck. Then try ""Awareness"" by Anthony DiMello. Anything of greatness will stand the test of time. In five years, Mr. Walsch will be long forgotten!"
1,Excuse me....there's a noticeable abscence of Jesus here....,"Echoing other's comments here...it sounded like a cool book until about page 20 or so....cool idea..but Biblical errors mixed with ""feel good"" garbage......God soon became the Earth and Wind and whatever.....that's where it lost me.....long before ""Heaven is the only place/ no Hell"" crap. Please know your Bible before you adopt this as ""Truth Addendum."" Am I the only one who noticed that Jesus is not mentioned or alluded to?? That's your litmus test. God says there are a few truths that will tell you whether what you are reading is from Him or not....whether they make you ""feel good"" or not."
1,Mr. Walsch obviously is unaware he is probably schizophrenic,"I was so excited about hearing that someone from the modern-day world actually spoke with the Creator of the world. I was hoping that Mr. Walsch was some kind of modern-day prophet, so I went out and bought his first two books.I was so very disappointed to see several blatant lies mixed in with uplifting and inspirational material. Lies, such as ""there is no Heaven or Hell -- it is only a state of being,"" were scattered throughout both books. These conversations Mr. Walsch has been having have NOT been with the God as portrayed in the Old or New Testaments of the Holy Bible.I believe Mr. Walsch is truly hearing voices and is most likely unaware he is schizophrenic. It is so sad that this man is delusional and needs psychiatric help.I recommend that all these books outlining conversations between Mr. Neale and his so-called God be pulled off the shelves immediately!"
2,nice thoughts.,I read this book when it first came out many years ago. The ideas are similar to other spiritual books put in a different way. A little old for present day philosophy but good when it first came out. I had however read a better book in this field so it made this one look rather lacking in foundation. Nevertheless a fun and interesting read.
1,Absolute rubbish,"I believe the author is channelling a very smart demon (an evil spirit).It's terribly sad how most people (even some Christians) do not recognize that this book is filled with absolutely unbiblical rubbish. Christians, if you'll learn Biblical truth, it will be very easy to identify what is and what is not from God.Note: God really does speak to all of his [truly born-again] children who submit their lives to Him and take the time to learn to hear and recognize His voice."
2,there are better books for serious truth seekers,"One's concept of God is always a projection of oneself. Walsh offers a concept more rational and approachable than that touted by organized religions, but there are better books for serious truth seekers, like God Without Religion and God Talks With Arjuna."
3,Conversations With God,"I enjoyed this book when I read it years ago, but I truly recommend reading the Bible in a version that you understand if you truly want to hear what God wants to tell us. All of life's 'instructions' are right there. God bless! :)John 14:6~ Jesus answered, ""I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the father except through me."""
5,"More terrifying and more difficult to understand than TILT, but","I can hardly wait for the next one. I hope it is not going to be another 10 years.I am, how should I say, now used to his style and love it."
5,Scott walker is still a genius,"Note how this album gets either five stars or one. The Drift draws a line in the sand. On one side, those who want reassurance from music. On the other, people open to new possibilites in sound. Thirty years from now, this album will be still be inspiring to anyone intereted in music as an art form. I think Scott Walker has managed to be brilliant in so many different ways over his long career, this is no excpetion.The person here who wrote that this is the sonic equivalent to a Francis Bacon painting was spot on. Raw, terrifying, beautiful."
1,Not for me,"Bought solely from positive reviews. Usually love the obscure hard to find melody type music. However, this was the first time I have ever found nothing redeeming at all and proceeded to put the cd in the trash. ""Whatever"" is all I thought while listening. You win some and lose some on buying solely from reviews which I love to do, kind of like educated gambling. Speaking of, research/reviews led me to Destroyers Rubies at the same time which I love."
5,"Great Scent, Great Results","Along with the other Rachel Perry products I use, this face wash is the most incredible cleanser I have ever tried! At first, I was using products that you may buy at the drug store(Olay, etc.)- and if I am going to pay that kind of money then what better to spend it on then a sweet yet subtle smelling face wash which has kept my skin looking good and feeling amazing in the month that I have been using it. Plus, natural ingredients keep my sensitive skin from breaking out. And if you get a chance, this product with the cucumber moisturizer, is the BEST combination..MMMM..yummy stuff.people love the smell and I am truly happy with the results. Rachel Perry forever!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great Book!,I love and am collecting all of Andy Andrews Books. It's fun reading and enjoy reading about different peoples opinions.
4,First story - ok the rest good,"Only hers - 3 stars; ok Shannon was a weeping willow wimp, Matt a brooding idiot. The best characters were Daniel Falcon and the ranch staff.The Heart of the Falcon- 3.5 stars- Daniel supposedly a man of integrity behaved abominably at first but I suppose he came good in the end. Madelyn well I suppose she loved him,if it was me from the time he denied the baby he wouldn't see me for dust. Best characters- John Henry Falcon and Felician Falcon. Kane and Matthew acted like hypocrites and as if their sister was a small child not a 24 year old woman.Break every rule - best story 5 stars! Love story handled well, with good emphasis on characterisation rather then the physical sex which is different but nice."
5,Special Memories,"Usually, I'm not much for a lot of nostalgia, but when I heard about this book I just had to check it out. Why? It is about my home town and written by a classmate of mine. However, I've shared it with friends and found that regardless of when they went to school or where they grew up, in small or larger towns, they share the same stories. With the horror of this week of 9/11/01, reading this was wrapping myself in the warmth of a comforting quilt of wonderful memories of growing up. Thanks, Steve! Move over Garrison Keillor!"
5,TRUE hidden gem!,"I admit I bought this initially because i am a Blood and Fire (the BEST reissue label!) completist, and was struck immediately by the quality of the tracks contained... some of the most beautiful and concious tracks you could hope to dig up are contained within... ""Assemble Not Thyself"" by the Terrors (WHO???), ""Desperate Time"" by the Chantells are right up there with the cream of reggae's elite... Phase One's output was not large, but with quality like this - you can tell the label was TRULY a labor of love... Also try to find the equally excellent CD ""We Are Getting Bad: The Sound of Phase One""- another NO OVERLAP collection of additional tracks - same era, same amazing quality... BUY THIS CD!"
5,be careful....be very careful,"if you decide to purchase this album, make sure that you are ready to ""fly away."" fly away to another level of consciousness. this is truly a great album. i cannot get the song ""send another moses"" out of my head. all songs on the album are great. they are well written and expertly carried out vocal and dub-wise. you must understand that the dub portions on the featured songs are the best dub ever produced.the songs intricately, and at times surprisingly, blend into each other. i wish that i could give this album a rating more than five stars. it is truly a gem.get it!!!"
1,Ethnic Stereotyping: Beware!,"I didn't realize when I made the purchase that the characters in this book promote ethnic stereotypes. However, as I started to read it to my 2 year old, I became painfully aware that all the ""good"" characters look German/Aryan, and all the ""bad"" characters look Jewish. I am German, and my child is Jewish...a very uncomfortable moment for me, even though she is only 2. I brought this book into my classroom to show my high school students after we read a Holocaust memoir, and they immediately made the connection. The German/Jew propaganda of Hitler looks a lot like the images in this book. I don't know anything about the author, and I wouldn't presume to say that this was intentional. Assuming the stereotyping is wholly unintentional, it's sad to see that, even in 1981, ""we"" were so saturated in racial stereotyping that we wouldn't ""see"" this, right off the bat. This book is good for it's social commentary; I will not read it to my child."
4,Takes me back 30 years!!,"My daughters, ages 31 & 29 both adored this book as children.Every trip to the library this book came home with us if it was available. I gave it to my 2 granddaughters for Christmas, ages 4 & 5 & they listened intently.I think my 31 year old daughter was more in love with it than they were at first but I am sure it will become a favorite for them too. I would have given it 5 stars except for the smaller sized boardbook."
5,I am so happy to have found these books again!,"My grandmother and I were recently discussing how she would read to all her grandchildren the ""Thingumajig"" books and how we all loved them. I am now 29 years old and still remember how vivid and wonderful they were. I just purchased them for my god sons, I hope they love them as much as I have."
2,Pretty colors but leak!,I bought these with some other office supplies and they proceeded to leak ink all over the place.The colors are nice and vibrant but they will leak and blob ink if left to sit too long.
3,Good for teachers that want to use HyperCard.,This is a good resource for teachers using HyperCard with their students. There may be a few besides me still out there!
5,Fantastic and Inspirational :-),"The music on this soundtrack is brilliant. It's uplifting and inspirational. Alicia Keys shines on this, and her voice is stunning. If the movie is as good as this soundtrack then it's going to be a major hit. There is something for everyone here with a solid r'n b feel and a little fast and a little slow. This is a great soundtrack and I can't wait to see the movie."
3,Glory Road....not so glorious,A few good songs but not many. Very dissapointed. Not enough scores from the movie.
5,Almost scary!,"If you LOVE girth, this is your toy! It's very, very, very, (did i say very?) thick.This baby is like a fist so be warned.I personally LOVE this beast.If it was any thicker I couldn't use it.I also like that it's not too long.I hate most other thick toys because usually they are so long it's stupid.This gives me exactly what I need every single time.I call her Miss Universe because she certainly rocks mine!"
5,The perfect stretcher.,"I've been looking for a toy like this for years. It's really perfect for the experienced anal stretcher. It provides an amazing stretch while not going too deep (I have other toys for depth play). Actually, right now I'm just sitting on it (all the way in), but it's also great for in and out thrusting when I'm in the mood for that. I also like that it's 100% silicone, so it's safe to leave in for a long time if I want to. It softens a bit after it gets warm in your body. I love it!"
5,Large-print must for lovers of Spanish with weakened eyes.,My mother is a native speaker of Spanish who passed on to me a love of language and accuracy in expression. In the last few years she has developed trouble in reading small print. I bought this for my mom for Christmas. She has used it constantly to check her understanding of both English and Spanish.
3,Spanish/English Dictionary,The Valazquez Large print Spanish/English dictionary is extremely helpful and informative. I would recommend to others.
5,Pivotal Literature,"If there were ever an encyclopedia dedicated to overcoming the fall of humanity, this would have to be present in the introductory portions that discuss the how and why of said encyclopedia. I think it could be termed a mini-masterpiece, a splendid double-feature, set to inspire human minds against the dim haze of complacency. Indeed, it is a tome for the cure social diseases."
4,Worked really well for me,Recommended by my counselor. Worked well for me when I was in a codependent recovery group and therapy. Would recommend it for other people going through the recovery of codependency.
4,"Good outline, lacks practical solutions","I am very thankful for this book, I learned things about myself that I couldn't quite figure out. This is the best thing I have seen about identifying these betrayal bonds. The problem I had with the book was it wasn't very helpful about where to go next and how to get better. I wish I would have had this years ago, and it was incredibly helpful in helping me identify things I never knew where they were coming from, and that is very helpful.I read the book again and changed my review."
5,The Betrayal Bond,"This is one of the BEST and most helpful books I have ever read. Truly has gotten me on the road to real healing and new life. Thank you Patrick Carnes for writing this well documented and very real book. I loved having the exercises to do before going to the next chapter and trust me...they are painful, difficult but if you open your heart and are real...they work miracles."
2,"Pricey, but cheap","From the packaging to the actual product, everything seemed cheap, especially compared to the Reed & Barton products that were purchased at the same time for about the same price."
3,Galla breaks the chain of conventionality,"Eli Galla's self-published adventure novel of like souls and minds coming together is both interesting and engaging. It begins on an Alaskan fishing trawler where the characters meet one another. They become uncomfortably acquainted with a slew of drug dealers who endanger their lives. Their boat is compromised and many, prominently Eddie Strand, struggle to survive whilst afloat in the Bering Sea. Back in Seattle more battles ensue, legal and otherwise. Meanwhile, Eddie and the women he has prevailed upon with his vision, Sherry, Heather and Beth are moving towards living a non-patriarchal existence. In essence, Break the Chain, reads like a thriller with spiritual dimensions."
4,A fun game for people of all ages,"This is a great game to play with kids and/or adults. The directions make it sound complicated, but this game is easy to learn and easy to play. It's like liar's poker, with dice. We have one for ourselves and bought another as a gift. Everyone we've played it with has enjoyed it."
5,"Perudo, the afterdinner game for young and old together","Afetr dinner games are seldom played today. Perudo invigorates all those who play it, its good fun, young and old can play it together. Everyone, losers and winners, enjoy it.An essential for family and social dinners."
4,Dice game for Fakers and Bluffers,"Went to my wife's family (bunch of fakers and bluffers) reunion picnic. They (6 relatives) were playing the Perdo dice game and having a great time. We got the game and 4 of us played. The host enjoyed the game so much, he would not let us change to a different game until he won one.As for playing Perudo, 6 players is the most enjoyable but 4's not bad.As far as dice games go I'd rank Farkle #1, Yahtzee #2, and Perudo #3 unless your playing with a bunch of fakers and bluffers and than it would be tied for 2nd."
4,Less Expensive form of Lactaid for the home or office,"I've been lactose intolerant for several decades. And the bottle of lactaid is great and cheaper than the pre-packaged,foil single tablets (those single tablets are great for traveling or carrying in your wallet)."
5,Cute book!,I love this series! I like how each book has a little bit of a mystery in it. Makes them hard to predict and really a joy to read.
2,Slightly more than common sense in a sincere work environment,"Similar to the other reviewer I feel this book is slightly more than common sense, though with the caveat that in an insincere and possibly aggressive work environment the tips given here may not work but require more subversive social tactics. It is a good book for someone who comes across people who are just being misunderstanding or hard to get along with. But for someone who has a purposeful bone to pick with you, this book Will Fall Short. At best it will at least tell you that you are doing the right thing, even if someone else you work with is not."
3,Disappointing,"If you lack common sense, this book is for you. But, I found that this book lacked substance and did not provide anything beyond outlining common sense solutions."
2,Buy a better book called `the ball python manual`,"I read both books. Whenever I encounter problems , I refer to the ball python manual. Many pictures posted are Boa constrictors. All the informations in this book can be found in web sites."
3,Covers the Basics,"I first bought this book when I was doing research, into the basics of Ball Python keeping. I've since expanded my collection on the subject to include works from Phillip V, the Barkers, the Southerlands, VPI and more.Although other books may cover more in-depth information on breeding & illness/treatments, this book does offer a good outline for basic care of Python Regius. As such, I do recommend it as a good book for a pet owner, but would also recommend additional books on the subject, this is not a stand alone work in my opinion."
3,Okay book.,"This is a good book to own but should not be the first in your collection. It has excellent photos and can be very good for a reference but I find some of the information in it is inaccurate compared to other sources of information, which is why I don't think it should be your first Ball Python book."
5,a good book for beginers and experienced snake keepers,this book has great pictures that will fasinate you and it tells everything you need too know about the ball python
3,"Great Cage, BUT BE CAREFUL","This cage is well built, a great size, and easy to clean.HOWEVER, my chinchilla Toby recently got his leg caught somewhere in the cage (possibly the ladder) and broke it so severely that it had to be amputated.If you buy this cage, take steps to make it safer for your animals (safer ladders, check shelves to make sure toes can't get caught, etc)."
2,Well-built but DANGEROUS,"We bought this product for our ferrets and were impressed with how sturdy it was compared with other cages in the same price category. Unfortunately, one of our ferrets got his leg caught in the space between the slats of the ramp and we found him hanging by that one leg. We rushed him to the Vet and after x-rays, found that the leg was broken. He underwent surgery for the break and is now OK. Our biggest problem is that when we called Midwest to report the situation, they couldn't have cared less!!!!! We have since covered all of the ramps to prevent a reocurance but I will NEVER buy another Midwest product again! BEWARE!"
2,Needs modifications to be a safe cage,"There are many reports of people's ferrets still getting legs trapped in ramps, between ramps, and toes in shelves. The new shelves they designed did nothing to fix it, it still has all sorts of gaps that your ferret's feet and toes can get stuck in.However, if you know this, and you can buy sets of ramp covers and shelf covers, this cage is great. Contact me or comment if you want to know a mailing list where you can ask where to buy sets from, or google them. I've personally had ferrets get mangled in the cages. :( Two stars for not fixing the shelf problem, and not having solid ramps with no gaps. This cage would be perfect if it combined the best of super pet's solid ramps and shelves instead of the metal. Time to mod my cages..."
4,Good as a Shell of a Cage,"So I'm the kind of 'mom' that spoils her little one. I got this cage for my chinchilla. Now before I purchased it, I read the reviews so in advance I was aware of the flaws, like how the shelves have a small gap in between the wire and the plastic flooring where the toes can get caught, and yes, watch out they that gap makes me cringe. Also I don't like the ramps since they are just made of wire and toes can get caught there as well.So my plans for this cage is to put sleep-n-ledges, and make my own long ledges and ramps out of 'chin-friendly' wood. On top of that, I'm going to put in a nesting box so there is a small dark place at the top of the cage he can sleep. Once all of that is done, this cage is going to be great. Its super tall and has lots of ample running space.Overall, I would only recommend this to someone that plans on adding their own shelves and ramps."
4,Great cage- flimsy tray,"I have a pair of chinchilla that love this cage. The big double doors are easy to open and make it easy to clean. They run up and down the levels all night, and it is big enough to fit the extra large wheel chinchillas need. The tray is shallow and flimsy, and the chins make a huge mess daily because the cage doesn't have a containment system for the shavings. In a shallow tray with no wire floor they run around in the shavings and kick everything over the side. The construction is sturdy, and the wheels make it easy to pull the cage out to vacuum up all the mess. I don't know if ferrets would be as rowdy in the chips, but a wire floor over the tray would have made this the perfect cage."
5,Good Cage,When I ordered this product it came in a matter of days. It arrived in a big box and I put it together with the help of my dad. Once it was set up I put my two ferrets in there and watched them explore their new environment. I had to put one litter box on the top part and another on the bottom because they kept going to the bathroom in different places but once both of the litter boxes were in they used them. They love how much room they have to play around in! And it makes it really easy to clean this cage with the trays on the levels. I just spray in some cage cleaner and wipe it all away. I really like this product and I would recomend it to anyone with ferrets.
5,Very nice cage,"I purchased this crate for 3 small kittens. It is very nice, easy to clean and the kittens love it. It also accomodates the mother cat easily and all can move from the top to bottom easily for exercise. Much easier to clean than the regular cat crate."
5,My boys love their new home!,I really love this product. It is huge so my Ratties have lots of room to run around and be separate if they want.
4,Roomy Fun,This cage was fairly easy to assemble and the ferrets (5 of them) have plenty of room. I'm going to have to rig up something around the sides to keep them from knocking out the litter though. But I love that you can take out the trays and hose them off!
5,Not just for ferrets!,"Very well made, and I use it for cats that I've rescued. Gives them the space, and security they need until they're rehabilitated. Price is quite reasonable for the quality!"
5,"High Quality, amazing price","I bought this home for my two newly aquired Chinchillas. The cage is giagantic - in a good way, I call it the Chinchilla Mansion. The animals have adequate room to sprint around, both in a horizontal and verical space. The cage can be sectioned off into two cages very easily.The cage itself is high quality, and rather heavy. The casters make the weight a non-issue - moving it around to sweep behind is very easy.Putting it together was a bit more work than I anticipated, but it was not difficult, and the instructions were clear.I have no negetive comments about this product, my pets are very happy, as am I. This is a high quality cage, and from shopping around in local stores, the price is beyond reasonable, it's practically rediculous! Most cages I've found are both too small, too short, or made of too much plastic. There *is* no better find for the money."
4,Nice cage,"What can I say, this is a great cage. The ferrets love it, the wide doors and trays make cleaning easy and there's plenty of room for toys and bedding. The only thing I would change is to make the vertical edges of the plastic trays a couple of inches taller to prevent ferrets with litter box problems from spraying out of the cage. The bottom line is this is the best ferret cage on the market."
5,Subjective,The artwork is good but the true beauty is in the impressions. The subject may or may not be a King. Most things are left to your imagination. Happinessevolves through perception. A King who does not converse except with a cat while regaining values and fulfillment.
2,A very big Cary Fan Hates This One!,"As much as it pains me to say, this is a terrible movie for Cary-and a terrible movie in general. All of Grant's strengths are hidden while he is asked to play a rugged, outdoorsman with no polish, class or sophistication. It sounds like a bad joke, doesn't it? Well it is. It hurts to watch this great actor stumble through this movie. Please keep in mind that I am a huge(maybe even obsessive) Grant fan, owning over 30 of his DVDs. This is, however, by far my least favorite. Sorry. Save your money and invest in the new Criterion edition of ""Notorious."""
3,Cary Grant -- miscast but still fun to watch,"At 115 minutes, this Hollywood historical film runs a bit long, and Cary Grant isn't the best fit for Matt Howard, but he is still fun to watch and the film covers interesting bits of the events leading up to the American Revolution, such as the Boston Tea Party. We also meet Thomas Jefferson and listen to Patrick Henry. The film's tension comes from the class differences between rebel Matt and his conservative wife, Jane. While the sets and costumes look good, the story lags at times, but this would be a worthwhile rental for Grant fans or Revolution cinephiles.The dvd features are: subtitles in English, French or Japanese, and trailers for three other classic films."
3,Old time movie,"I saw this movie while flipping through the channels and watched it briefly. I purchased it for a ""surprise"" gift for friends with the same last name. I really can't rate this item as I did not watch the complete movie. However, the DVD was received promptly and in good condition, as always, from Amazon.com"
5,Fantastic Book!,Down to earth and easy to read. It explores the history that molded St Katherine and her life in a very interesting style
3,biography/religious also informative re demograpy,"3/24/04 This ""biography/religious ""on the life of ""the Drexel family's Katharine(whose maternal side of the family were of German origin/"" the Langstroth"" of Germantown,PA and were not Catholic(they were ""Dunkards/now called the Church of the Brethern"" who later started her own order for ""Indians and coloureds""(and was canonized 10/01/2000 as ""saint"") also gives great details regarding ""Catholic life"" which was encircled by the Catholic Churches and its parishes. The Catholic Church's embracement of the ""ethnic"" communities was the thorn/rose that spurred Katharine Drexel into founding her ""Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament"" ."
1,Customer of Raindrip no more!!,"Every single one of these leaked fresh out of the pack with minimal pressure.Minimal pressure is one end of the tube in a glass of water two feet above my kitchen sink so I can test for leaks. They ALL dripped slowly out the end.This combined with the horrible tubing that takes a lighter and an act of god to get a good seal on has lost them a customer of almost two decades. In case you were wondering why I was testing the system at my sink, in the last 5 years the quality of product has degraded so badly that I spend more time troubleshooting the new parts than putting the system up every year. 5 years ago I could go out, throw up a new drip line and be in business. Now I have to test the entire thing and seal the junctions with heat."
1,Good door stop,"I've been trying to study from this book for the past year and have found it poorly indexed, with minimal useful information for the early plastic surgery trainee compared to other sources availible which are far more indepth relevant and cheap. The online material is frustrating and is limited to only 2 computers. Not useful enough to justify the cost at my early level of training."
3,low cost router,"Kind of surprised of the reviews other gave this tool .I own roughly 10 routers .Have owned this one several years .For the money it comes with a lot of stuff and features .But i found it was really a bit light weight . Mine is in a table and I have never used it in any other way .The lift mechanism broke right off ,they were fast at sending new parts .but it broke again soon after ,they are all plastic parts.I added a Router Raizer . the router has a plastic housing ,I find that it cannot handle a lot of bit or load without deflection . recently using a small bit with rpms up all the way it let out a lot of smoke .though it is still working .I think you get what you pay for in this case."
5,A Great Tool,"I purchased this tool as a gift for my husband, who has a woodworking shop and makes many fine pieces from wood. He loves this router and highly recommends it to anyone who does woodworking or anyone who needs an exceptional tool that does what it is supposed to do in an exceptional way.Jeannie Walker Award Winning Author"
1,Very frustrating to change bits. Defective unit?,"This is my first router and was intended for use primarily in a router table. What attracted me to this router was the ability to change bits without removing it from the table. It turns out I've had endless problems getting the router to raise to its full height so that I can do this. After spending a few hours tracking down someone in the US who could help, I found someone and thought the issue was caused by me using a foot switch to turn on/off the router. It turns out this wasn't the case.My son disassembled the collet locking rod assembly and cleaned it. It worked once after it was cleaned. Then it was back to its same ole' tricks. I finally gave up and bought a Peachtree offset collet wrench to change the bits..A very frustrating experience, both from the tool not working and poor customer support perspectives."
1,triton router - biggest mistake I ever made,"I bought this Triton router after a very favorable review in Fine Woodworking magazine. It looked lovely in the carrying case that it arrived in. I didn't need it right away and now a couple of years later I can't get a manual for it. Some of the accessories are only carried by Amazon.UK and they can't ship anything like that to the USA. Can't get parts from Australia either - it's almost as if the entire non-US world had taken out sanctions against the USA - how did I miss that - I read the paper regularly. The parts and accessories I want exist and I can't get them because of some sort of ban. As for the manual, the Triton Website only provides a basic brochure and a parts list for download. There's nothing to tell a first-time router owner how to put this thing together or how to keep from losing his fingers. PHOOOEY!!"
3,nearly took my fingers off,great router bad operator. It is really robust and has a lot of power and changing a bit is as easy as turning a screw.
1,Loose Tolerances,This unit had too much clearance on the guide posts and caused poor routed surfaces. The cutter would vibrate and initially the router was stopped to see if the cutter was tightened properly. The cutter cold be moved 12 mils on an indicator with no undue force and the guide post had a measured 4.5 mils movement. Triton said this was not right and Amazon sent another with the same problem. I'm moving to a JessEm router lift.
5,A great router,"I bought this router based on a good review of routers for use with a table. It is everything the review said. It is very precise. I can easily change the cutting depth and change bits from above the table. I comes with a real wrench for the collet, not the typical stamped metal wrench. It has enough power that it does not slow down at reasonable feed rates. The mounting holes did not match any that were already in my table but it was easy to adapt. I have another router that I use free hand so I can not rate this router for non-table use."
3,router is great- however...,"I'm very pleased with the router itself. However, I'm very displeased that the guide bushing set that is sold as an accesory does not work with the router! The baseplate doesn't fit. After contacting Triton, I was told that the guide bushing set is designed for the larger 3 hp router, and they were very vague as to when/if a suitable guide bushing set would be available. I'm considering returning the router and bushing set because much of my routing is hand held, and I use bushings extensively."
5,Great router,"This router is all it is advertised to be. Very smooth, easy to use and powerful enough for the best home woodworker and DYI. I have four other routers and only wish I had not waited so long to purchase the Triton. I really enjoy being able to raise and lower the bit without having to reach under the router table to make the adjustment. The locking of the spindle when raised is just great. I would recommend it to anyone that needs a router for installing in a table. Needless to say, it also works extremely well as a freehand unit."
2,unhappy,"I was excited to purchase this router. I own 7 other routers and a few trimmers but am always looking for something better, this machine is not it. I think they designed the router for table use, at which it might be OK but for hand held use it lacks a decent system for controlling depth stops. It is a cheesy plastic thing that won't rotate because the pan head screw that holds it just gets tighter when you rotate it clockwise and if you rotate it counter-clockwise then the whole thing becomes loose and floppy. After reading the reviews I thought it might be a well thought out machine but in regards to the depth stop it is not thought out at all. To much cheap plastic for me. In a table with little use besides up and down then it might be OK, but I don't know about that even."
2,Not the best.,"Considering how much you pay for these, you probably aren't expecting a whole lot. But honestly its not worth the money you save. I found the magnifying power and clarity to be disappointing and also would have liked to be able to adjust the distance between oculars more than the design allowed."
3,Buy the older version / Lonley Planet Mongolia,"I Just got this book and it is page for page exactly the same is the older version. I was expecting something new from this as it was pulbished in 2008 / same - save yourself a few bucks and get the older one. If your going to Mongolia a phrase book is a must have , I lived there 1 year with my wife and learned to speak mgl w/o a phrase book. There are no english to mgl phrase books in Ulaan Baatar , only cyrillic mgl to english . So if your going , I would reccomend buying either one ."
4,Small size needs small expectations... I suppose,"This little phrasebook is not too bad... however, in some of the places cyrillic text is missing (can be good to have).Missing some of very basic words as for example ""head"", ""face"" and others.Missing also some shorter explanation about the persian script that was used mostly before, but in lot of places even today.But again... if you have no clue at all about Mongolian language, this little book is pretty good to have."
3,"not so great, useful however","I agree with the previous reviewers: the phonetic pronounciations given in the book are quite rough. However, as I had no idea of Mongolian language, showing the written cyrillic text was helpful and a basis for learning from natives during my trip."
5,Good cleanser,We just replaced our old electric coil cook top with black ceramic cartridges which require constant cleaning to remain shiny and looking good. These wipes makes the job very easy and quick and my new tops remain looking brand new and bright. I am happy with the results!!!
1,Not worth it,"I am a huge fan of the Quick Fix series and own all of them. This,however, is not worth the money. #1- You spend so much time trying to put your feet on the dots while doing the routine. #2- The routines aren't even routines. The first segment is basically circling the dots. I'm afraid that my neighbors will see me turning in a circle irratically the way she leads, and they'll think I'm performing some weird sacrificial ritual.Save your money and buy quick fix hip hop released a few years ago. Also good is Quick Fix Cardio kick."
2,Too bad it has slow touch and causes mistakes,I am a medical transcriptionist. Often I have to hit the keys (hard) because a letter doesn't type or the space bar fails to work the first time. It is a nice keyboard for someone who doesn't type very much but now I am faced with buying a new (and most likely more expensive) keyboard that has a better touch and response time. In the space of several hours this gets VERY annoying and it makes me want to scream.
3,Okay for basic tasks - mouse is not good at all,"I picked up this keyboard set as my first wireless combo and it is . . . okay.For basic web browsing, typing etc the keyboard is fine however I can't really recommend the LX 710 because of the mouse. It really is horrible. The main issue is the buttons. I am constantly having to find just the right spot where clicking the left mouse button will actually register a click. The middle mouse button also needs quite a lot of pressure to register. Is it a small issue? Well, I guess it depends on how much you use your mouse buttons. I need a 3-button mouse for professional 3D applications and am constantly using the middle mouse button, however it is just not easy to use.Overall this combo does the job, however I am not particularly impressed and will more than likely be going back to one of Logitech's wired mice."
3,Fair,"This is my first wireless desktop, so I can't compare it to other models.I'v been using it for some weeks now, and it works fine most of the time.It has two weak spots however that can be very annoying.Sometimes the mouse sort of freezes up, it will move verrrrry slowly and then starts to respond normally again.The other thing is that the <ctrl> buttons seem to be VERY unsensitive. This results in failing copy/paste actions, zooming in photoshop etc.This doesn't seem to be a common issue. Since I live abroad returning the item is not really an option so I guess I'll just have to live with it.For the most part it just works fine."
3,Decent hardware.. buggy software,My rating are as follows:Keyboard: 5/5Mouse: 2.5/5 -- I also have a G7 mouse so my standards are a bit loftySoftware: 2/5 -- Logitech = excellent hardware -- bad softwareOverall this wireless combo is a worthy improvement over lesser brands out there (for example Kens****** and Micr*****.If they sold the keyboard and mouse saparately; it would provide a better package since you would be able to pick a better mouse.--Ciao
4,Good Item!!,"Shipping was prompt (2-days for Super Saver) and keyboard and mouse are comfortable, and work well. Touch of the keyboard is excellent. Software shipped with units was not latest version. Vista software was downloaded at Logitech web site. CD included was labelled for XP and 2000. I was disappointed that the programmable hot keys require that the ""Function"" key be pressed along with the F-key... There is a key labelled ""VOIP"" that would be more useful if it were labelled ""internet."" At (...) rebate, it is a real bargain..."
1,Letters are barely visible,"Product worked okay, but the letters on the keyboard are so tiny, I replaced it with a standard Microsoft board. If you need to see the keys, don't buy this product."
1,Nothing But Trouble,"[ [ASIN:B000AY5ZIS Logitech Cordless Desktop MX 5000 Laser (967558-04 03)]] This a terrible product,constant problems,too many to list.A headache maker.The bluetooth setup is un-useable.Do Not Buy This!"
4,Decent Wireless Keyboard,This is a pretty decent wireless keyboard. I liked my previous one a little better because of the ergonomic keyboard. Keys are very quiet.
4,"Wireless Keyboard, mouse combo",It is a great combo set. It does what I wanted and more. I would recommend it to anyone.
4,Logitech Cordless Desktop LX 710 Laser,"Great product. Easy setup. Comfortable and precise. I've been using the set for 10-12 hours per day since I got it. No problems so far. I had a MS Wireless Keyboard, but gave me a lot of headache and trouble while using it. This unit has a better response and far better range than MS one. The wrist support area is functional and the area is enough to rest the palms, but for those who have a bigger hands might not be enough. The overall finish quality/feeling is very good. The wireless mouse is lovely and very comfortable too. I like the power on/off feature to save the battery when not using it. The USB wireless receiver is a perfect feature and the wired USB adapter offers a longer range. It is worth to consider when looking for a wireless keyboard combo.After 8 months of use : after 6 mths of use the letter 'A' was gone. I think I read this before buying the unit and now I can confirm that. All other letters on the keyboard are ok, but 'A'."
1,This is a great keyboard that doesn't reliably work,"I have been using the LX 710 for about a year. It's a great keyboard on which to type, very comfortable, etc. I have had consistent problems with connectivity, dropped keys, having to pull reset the connection. I find that it consumes battery juice faster that expected. It works beautifully and then for several minutes, I'm fiddling with it...working to bring 'er back to life. Perhaps my unit is simply buggy. However, there may be another more current Logitech system that works more reliably.Go for a newer unit. Otherwise, the ergodynamics with a good wrist pad, support are good. You want a keyboard to work 100% of the time without fail. I don't feel that this one hits the mark. Portability is great but when you are typing and it drops keys...this is frustrating."
3,Eats Batteries,"This is the second Logitech desktop that I have owned. Unfortunately this one eats batteries, literally I have to replace the batteries in the keyboard every month or two. The previous keyboard (different model) would last closer to a year before needing new batteries. The other complaint that I have is that the wrist rest has become discolored.I would not recommend this keyboard and mouse setup. The product works fine and I have not had any problems, but the battery life unacceptable."
2,Space bar sticks after 3 months,The spacebar has become useless after only 3 months. I have to replace this expensive boat anchor now. Reliability is a thing of the past I guess...
1,looked nice didn't work,After doing a lot of research on a wireless keyboard and mouse I ordered this one. It arrived and never worked.
4,Great keyboard and mouse,"I am very happy with this keyboard and mouse. The only thing that is taking some getting used to is the position of the function keys. Otherwise, I am pleaesd with this. I use the keyboard for data entry, etc. and have had no issues."
2,Not very ergonomic.,"The only good thing about this product is that it is cordless, but the ergonomics for this set is not good!!"
4,"Good product, key layout a little diferent, battery sucker","I enjoy this product eliminating all the cables and allowing easy adjustment of volume and other features. However, be prepared to change the batteries very often! It is probably a good idea to work with rechargeables."
4,Functions as advertised,"Logitech Cordless Desktop LX 710 LaserWhen I purchased on 11/24/1008 cost was [...] with a promised rebate from Logitech of additional [...].Product extremely easy to install - just plug it in and start working. Keyboard has a little too many extras which I strike by accident but can live with those inconveniences for now.The promised rebate (Amazon furnished form) did not materialize. It appears that the company with a Phoenix address went belley-up and Logitech asked someone else to handle for them. Their automated telephone for checking rebate gave me information on TiVo I purchase from Amazon. I lowered from five stars because of the poor support where there is no ""live"" person to talk to - it must all be accomplished by e-mail.If i had known of the poor support and the difficulty in obtaining the promised rebate I would have purchased a less expensive model without all the frills that I don't need anyway."
2,Not acceptable,"The keyboard lags terribley. It will barely work if you have it too close to the wireless reciever. The Mouse lags terribley. You absolutely cannot play computer games with this or you will want to break your computer. Maybe I just got a bad one though....other than that, everything else is fine."
4,Longest Wireless range i've come across!,"like the subject says, with this wireless desktop, i can be clear across the room and still able to use the mouse & keyboard without flakey response. and with the mouse being a Laser type, I can use it on any surface."
1,logitech cordless,Could not get it to synch up. Must press little buttons at once. Finaly got an IT guy toget it to work. Then after two days it quit again. So now I am using my old plug-in stuff and thewireless keyboard and mouse are sitting in the corner. Will send back when I get time.
4,Overall good product,"For the most part, I do like this combo. The infrared range is decent, and it's adjustable. I love being able to control Windows Media Center, and adjusting the size of the screen has become a must-have. The downside would be sometimes certain F keys don't work the first time I push them or they do the opposite of what they should. For example, the volume increases when I want it to decrease or turns up when I want to mute. And the battery life for the mouse is not what I expected. I purchased this in September and I've changed the mouse's battery twice since then. I'm brutal on a mouse, I suppose. Hope this helps."
3,Nice design.. Not a large range,This keyboard works well and is really responsive but does not have a long range. I bought this for our board room at work (about a 30 foot long room) and it works only about half way down the room. Same with the mouse. Other than that it works great!
5,"Excellent quality, many helpful features...buy it!!!","I won't bore you with the same praises as everyone else, but suffice it to say I have purchased many of these for myself, for family and for clients. The build is concise and reasonably rugged. The features are numerous...and more importantly, they all WORK as described or labeled. Battery life is well within reason and installing it is as simple as can be. If you're looking to free up your workspace from cables, this is an excellent, reliable, feature-rich solution.Buy it!!!Ray"
2,Battery eating mouse,"Works as intended, but Logitech says in manuals to expect 4 months of battery life from mouse. I'v owned product for about 6 months and changed the mouse batteries 3 times so far, less than 2 months per change. Not very ""green"". Listen, I can afford the batteries, but--call me deluded--I expect more. Logitech has work to do ..."
5,Great product,Purchased after reading the positive reviews and have to say that our experience with the mouse and keyboard has been great. Very easy to install and use. Mouse fits perfectly to our hands and the keyboard has just the right tapping pressure. Would recommend to anyone.
5,Logitech Cordless Desktop LX 710 Laser,"Logitech Cordless Desktop LX 710 LaserGood product, easy to use, work in any position."
5,Excellent product -- highly recommended,"I bought an HP cordless desktop at Walmart and returned it two days later because it had a cheap feel to it. For a few dollars more, I bought this Logitech cordless desktop from Amazon. It is much better. The keyboard and laser mouse feel solid and well constructed. You won't find a cordless desktop of this quality at a store for this price. It was a really good deal."
5,Exactly what I was looking for...,"I bought this as a replacement for an ""obsolete"" Logitech keyboard and mouse. This is a wonderful, no-gimmicks keyboard and mouse combo. It's not bent, it's not curved, not waved, not humped, not wedged, nor otherwise misshapen in any way. It's also the correct size to fit into a standard keyboard slide-out. Great concept, great product."
4,Does what it's intended to do!,"For those who aren't expert on this sort of stuff (like myself) the following is what i would have found useful in a review:Range: Good. works from 6 feet away.Feel: The keyboard is great. the plastics feel ""premium"". the keys press nicely, with comfortable travel and they are not noisy. lots of extra buttons provide shortcuts to iTunes, browser, e-mail etc. programable ""f-keys"" are great too. You get used to them quickly and then wonder what you do without them! Mouse feels chunky and solid. Precision is good.battery life: no issues so far but then I've not had it long.All in, happy with the purchase!"
2,Good mouse defective keyboard,"After very limited use, the #3 key on the number pad has stopped working. Disappointing."
3,"For HTPC application, don't get this, go with bluetooth","I figured an RF for this price would give me good range, but it didn't. My max range was maybe 3 feet. I'm in an apartment and have a wireless network as well as surrounded by others' wireless networks. Maybe this or other random signals around me interfered with the RF frequency and caused the range to be minimal?If you are looking for an HTPC wireless keyboard, get the logitech MX Revolution or another comparable _BLUETOOTH_ wireless keyboard/mouse combo. Yes, it's more expensive, but it's worth it. It'll go up to 30 ft. I have one now and will never look back.However, if you just need short range and you just hate wires, this is an OK buy. IMHO, it does just as good as the 20-30 dollar wireless keyboard/mouse combos though, so I would recommend that instead."
1,"Frustrating, Inconsistent, Keyboard Lag","The frustrating part of this product is that when it works, it is not a bad product. It's when the connection issues start up that it becomes incredibly irritating. I have used this keyboard for over a year with only keyboard lag as the only problem, which in itself is minor. I had also used it on my Wii, Xbox 360 successfully. However, for the past year or so, the keyboard and mouse simply do not connect with any consistency. More often than not, the keyboard and receiver simply do not connect to one another. When it does connect, typing is impossible: the shuffle key is ""t"" for some reason and ""q"" key is ""r"". I simply hate this product now, which is a shame, because I use other Logitech products for years with great confidence, such as the Harmony remotes and webcams.I don't think there is a warranty on this product for the LX 710, but I do not think I will be buying another Logitech wireless keyboard or mouse for a very long time."
2,Works good if you're not gaming.,"This product (Keyboard and mouse) works great if you don't play a lot of games and have to use both the keyboard and mouse at the same time, but for me, whenever I'm using like the W key to move forward and I want to use my mouse to look around me, I stop moving forward, or I end up spinning around, haha. And it seems to only happen when I try to use them both at the same time. I'm not sure if it's a connectivity issue with the two items or what. I might go back and try the wireless mouse and my wired keyboard and see if that fixes the problem.It's a real shame though that they don't work together, because I really love the way they look and work. (Minus when you gotta use them both when playing a game.)"
5,Every One Loves It,"I have been wearing this for years and there is not one day that some one ask me , what is that you have on. The men Love it. Its smooth and not strong like others that make you have an headache. They sell this in many differnt parfum smells. The Elephant Jungle is the only one I would buy. Kenzo has others that are to stron. I swear to you...You will love this and make everyone around you enjoy your smell not try and avoid. So I only suggest the Kenzo Jungle, with the ELEPHANT. I swear by it."
2,Depressing,"I actually feel that I read a different book from the other reviewers. Although I thought that the author's intentions were good, I didn't find the book to be at all positive or uplifting. There is much more up-to-date treatment information available at the International Myeloma Foundation and other websites. There is also a great forum on the Leukemia and Lymphoma website where patients and caregivers can share their experiences and advice."
4,Good overview to start with,"Excellent overview for newly diagnosed, but with treatment modalities, newer diagnostics and staging criteria, I find most of the best up to date and newer info from the heme/onc or websites such as IMF (international myeloma foundation) or American Cancer Society."
5,Real Help and easy to understand,"It's so easy to get lost in a lot of the medical stuff about myeloma, but this book helps anybody to understand it a while lot better. In addition to getting into the nature of the disease and different treatments, the writer delivers a load of great tips that none of the doctors really get into. As your life turns into hell, this book is a big help in making things a bit better in a lousy situation. The forms are pretty good although I like their download thing on the internet."
2,Don't bother buying this,"Bought this product for our scheduled camping trip in August. The unit arrived with a defect. First, The display button that is suppose to give you the number of watts drawn by your load (through the inverter) is not functioning, it displays zero all the time. Second, according to the manual if you press the display button the second time, it should give you the remaining battery life in percent. But even this, is not functioning too. Third, When you turn on the main switch with the load already plugged in, the cooling fan (pressumably for the compressor) most the time will kick-in thus eating up extra juice from your battery. So I then called amazon and they were so quick to send me a replacement but it is unfortunate that no luck for me because the second unit that they sent me, is as bad as the first one so I am going to send it back to them."
2,I would not buy again,"This arrived missing the cap for the light. It doesn't seem to last very long at all before it loses power - it is simply powering a motion-activated remote camera, and will not go two days. The button that is supposed to cause battery strength to be displayed when pressed - doesn't work most of the time. I would never buy this again."
3,"Reliable product, recommended for power outages","Have owned the the Xantrex Powerpack a little over 4 years now. Have used it to jump start cars, inflate tires, and as an emergency AC power source. My electric utility is not the most reliable so this is useful for powering lights with compact fluorescent bulbs and a small TV during power outages that last a few hours. The air compressor works ok, not great. The unit is quite heavy, as lead-acid batteries are. Still the original battery, but it's starting to self-discharge a little faster than when new (as indicated by the built-in % charge meter). Would buy it again."
1,Air Compressor Failed Prematurely,"Air compressor failed prematurely shortly after warranty period (only used in 3 or 4 times to inflate tires.) Product only has a six month warranty, hardly time to really put any stress on the product. Also, AC output (converted from DC battery) is OK for lights but the power is ""dirty"" and causes terrible static in a boom box. It did jump start a car, however. Once. Not worth the money with this level of reliability and quality."
1,Do not buy...unreliable...no service for repair,"A plastic gear in the compressor was stripped after just one year of use (the compressor was used maybe 5 times).Xantrex would not service the unit (at any cost), sell a replacement gear, or provide any discount on a replacement unit.Don't buy this."
5,Better than Described!,"I was so pleased with my first unit that I purchased two more. I own five 13Watt solar panels and each Powerpack 400 can be fully charged with a single 13Watt solar panel. I only had to solder Radio Shack plugs to some braided hookup wire. This is covered in the instruction manual and is really easy to do.The Powerpack batteries are cheap and easily user replaceable. Additionally, I can hookup larger amperage batteries (using the supplied jumper cables) to the Powerpacks - thus increasing running time on each unit.Since my Radio Shack battery charger (for 9Volt, AAA, AA, and D size NMh batteries) functions with a 12Watt DC current, I can use the Powerpack to charge these little batteries when the grid power is down."
2,All ways something wrong with this,"The first one I got had the AC converter break beyond repair so I got another the second one came with a radio but soon after recieving he second one the recharging light and the indictor lights stoped working, so now I have no idea if it is charging or how much the battery is depleted.This product is not reliable I would not recommend it."
3,adequate,Battery life with very minor load excellent. Have not used it to jump start any thing yet and frankly don't think it will cut it. AC outlets trip off with small loads.
2,Don't throw away the original packaging,"The unit performed at about 40% of advertised. Could only run a laptop computer for just over 2 hours.Having difficulty right now returning due to the fact that I discarded the original packaging. I really expected it to work, so why would I need the original packaging.May be a bad unit, but eating the cost for return shipment makes it an expensive trial."
2,Only lasted 2 months,"Bought this for camping - used it once with no problems. When we got back we plugged it in (the manual says you can leave it plugged in all the time)a couple of weeks later I noticed the display was flickering, when I unplugged it the display did nothing (it should show percentage of charge or amp draw depending which 'mode' you're in) The 'customer support' number listed in the manual is not a good number, so I went through a process of requesting online support - 2 days later I got an email back asking me to call a different support number and supplied a 'case number'. 20 minutes on hold later, Xantrex told me to talk to Amazon, I told him I was out of my 30 day 'return window' with Amazon. The product has a 90 day warranty, and I was within that, but he insisted it wasn't their problem, but Amazon's. I sent an email to Amazon and they are going to allow a return, which I really appreciate, but still feel Xantrex really let me down, not to mention I still need one of these!"
4,"Great product, works as advertised. Tested some actual run times.","I bought this mainly for some kind of backup power during our hurricane season in Florida.I tested the following items separately to see what kind of duration I'd get:Dell Inspiron 8100 laptop - 4.8 hours before alarm sounded (uses 70 watts)Emerson 13 inch color tv - 4.1 hours before alarm sounded (uses 72 watts)The unit actually came almost fully charged for me. When recharging after totally drained it took about 30 hours until I got the solid green light. One person had a great idea, during a power outage for a couple days, and after using up all the juice in the generator, he used his car to recharge it. It says it would take 3 hours to charge a fully drained generator through the cigarette lighter but when you don't have power for a week, that's a nice way to keep the unit going.Fred"
4,Nice but...,"Well I have only had the chance to use this once. I tried to start a Dodge van that had a dead battery. This unit did not have enough juice to turn the van over. It looks really nice, and seems like it is built well. The light on it is cheap but the rest of it seems nice. Maybe it would work better on smaller vehicles... Time will tell."
1,Xantrex Inverters Fail,"Xantrex inverters commonly fail in these units, after the 6 month warranty has expired; these failures invariably occur during trips, creating emergency situations. They do not take the units back for repairs; and new batteries are not available ! Over the past 6 years, I have had 3 of them fail. If they could come up with a high quality inverter and make the batteries available, these units would be excellent. Two of their technical support personel have told me that I need to buy a new unit when something goes wrong."
1,Failed after 3 uses/Xantrex would not fix,"I used this to power a low-wattage shop light 2 or 3 times, then it stopped working. Through email with the company, they told me that the inverter had failed and they wouldn't replace the unit without a reciept. This was a gift to me, so no receipt and they refused to do anything more to help."
4,POWERPAC 400 PLUS,"WORKS GREAT.KIDS WATCH 15""TV-DVD PLAYER ALL NIGHT WHILE WE WERE CAMPING ON THE RIVER AND THE NEXT DAY IT JUMP STARTS THE BOAT NEXT TO US.GREAT TO CARRY JUST IN CASE."
4,Power-On-The-Go,"This item was a replacement for a similar model that we have used for years. It is wonderful for emergencies, but also for outdoor activities that require portable power, compressed air or a quick ""jump."" Very affordable and simple to use."
2,Sooo Tiny!,"I purchased this dog as a replacement for my sister when she lost hers. Hers was the exact same poodle except for one thing, it was about 10 times bigger than this one. For $12 I was really expecting something much larger since the one she used to have was purchased for $14. Highly disappointing."
1,Pointless verbiage around the subject,"This book breaks all the good rules for the text books. Set your expectations straight: glossary does not exist, index is incomplete, definitions of terms are either absent or given after 10 pages of waterly discussions into the term. Many times book talks about the term without ever defining what it is. No summaries at the end of the chapter. Explanations at first appear to be plain English and simple until you realize that subject is not there.My guess is it was probably meant for the experienced bookkeepers or accountants who need some high-level essays on the philosophy of accounting. However, section ""For whom is this book?"" clearly refers to people that have no accounting background or who took a class or two and never practiced it. The only reason why I am giving it 1 star is becuase Amazon does not give me an option to rate it with 0 stars."
3,More than I needed,"This book is a lot more than I had originally bargained for. Though it stated it was a fairly simple and straightforward text after initial read through it became quite clear, that this volume would suit someone with an accounting background already established. I would not recommend this book to start with."
2,I would not choose this book,"In preparing for an financail class, I bought this book to help prepare me. I wish I had done a little research first. The lessons are OK, but among other things, there are a lot of editing mistakes, which can me one wonder if the answer is wrong because it's wrong, or the solution given is wrong. Also there are few examples that do not address all aspects of the lesson; the test question at the end will ask a different aspect not previously brought up.I would choose another book."
1,Don't waste your Money-A Duke MBA,"I bought this book to prepare for financial accounting. I do not recommend it, get the ""Accounting for Finance"" Workbook. This is basic accounting, not very related to actual financial analysis."
4,Excellent multi-cultural book!,"This was a wonderful multi-cultural story about the need to fit in. It shows the dilemmas a young girl faces at a new school trying to make friends. While she makes the wrong choice, everything turns out for the best (as one would expect). The heroine finds out who her true friends really are. A great story line for teaching ancestry and good citizenship. My 3rd grader loved the story!"
4,The book you have to read,"This book is about a little girl named Oy. She moved to America with her family from Thailand. A mean kid from school named Frankie would tease her just because the way she looks and her religious background. He would say ""Chinese girl."" Oy would say ""stop I'm not Chinese"" but Frankie would still tease her. One day she dropped her backpack in school a lovely picture of her in a pink threaded dress with a hair piece and jewelry fell out. The most popular girl saw it. Her name was Lilindra. Lilindra had a club and Oy wanted to be in it so badly. Lilindra said I will let you be in the club if you let me try on that dress.Well I bet you're wondering what she did. I&#65533;m not going to tell you. You're just going to have to figure it out yourself by reading The Gold Threaded Dress.I think you should read this book. It's really good."
4,Super for average bottles,"This is a great appliance. Haven't used for tailgating, but it works great for average size wine bottles and sodas. Faster than portable ice chest with 50% ice and 50% water mix. Having said that, it doesn't accommodate large (round, girth) bottles, such as champagne bottles and XL wine bottles (doesn't do girth not length)."
5,Love it.,Great to have chilled wine in 6-7 minutes. Easy to use. A little noisy but did not disturb party or interfer with conversation.
2,"Worked great for a year, then it died...","Great concept, great product, but then it suddenly stopped working after only a year (about 20 uses)."
4,"Love the convenience, hate the giant plug","This cooler is awesome to get a super chilled beverage (like white wine or beer) just moments after you get home from the store buying it. My only compliant is that I didn't realize how HUGE the plug was. I suppose it's because you can take it with you for tailgating, but when we use it in our kitchen (where it nearly always resides), the giant transformer in the wall is really ugly. Plan to store it in a cupboard rather than out on your counter."
4,Great cooler!!,Works as stated...gets wine from room temp to 40 degrees in about 6 minutes. Way cheaper than a wine refrigerator to operate.
1,2 units not working at all,"My Dad bought this chiller for me as a gift. The first one came and it was not working at all when plugged in the regular outlet, but worked fine when plugged in the car outlet. Since we wanted this for use at home, we called amazon.com and they told us to return this item and they shipped a new unit to us fast. Well, the second unit came and it has the same problem -- not working when plugged inside! Yes, we tried different outlets (the ones other appliances work when plugged in), but still the unit is not working. We'll just return it and buy something else."
3,Great idea.... but....,"This is such a great idea, but having to add ice and then water, defeats the whole purpose. I could put the bottle in the freezer for the same amount of time or less. Sorry but this got a thumbs down and I'm returning it. : ("
5,How Full is Your Bucket? A great tool for anger control,"""How Full is Your Bucket"" is a great tool I use with my anger control coaching clients.It helps us to realize the importance of our responsibility to focus on the needs of others more than those of our own.Many people facing anger problems have trouble accepting responsibility. It's all about blame and excuses. This CD program helps them understand that by accepting our responsibility to fill the buckets of others with positives, it returns to us and makes our lives better.William C. Smith, Alpha Process Coachwww.angercontrolrc.com www.successrc.com"
4,Great Book,This book is a simple concept that is a nice refresher that anyone can use both in business and in your personal life. It's a nice reminder that the more positive side of life produces better results.
3,Didn't Really Inspire Me,"I thought this was a little corny, but OK as far as motivational materials go."
2,Not their best effort...,"Given the experience and positions of the players (Regni is principal saxophone of the NY Philharmonic), I expected a much more polished performance.The players don't seem to blend well with each other, and the recording seems forward and top-heavy, with the soprano almost screeching at times. Not pleasant, especially when compared to the sound of more refined quartets, such as the New Century S.Q. (try ""Standards"" for a nicer reading of the Mintzer) and younger quartets like Adelphia (try their recording of the Histoire du Tango for more flair, style, and character if not intonation).Intonation is a problem on this recording. It might have been okay if the players weren't as seasoned or didn't have big names. But I was disappointed pretty much from the first note at the lack of sensitivity to tone quality, blend and intonation in this group.This recording is a valiant try, but hopefully in the future ones they pay more attention to the finer points of ensemble playing."
2,headphone,"I brought this for jogging use, but found that the clip that goes over the ear is just too loose and does keep slipping off. I have to now use it just while not exercising. It would be nice if had a click mechanism that kept the clip close to the ear. Sound is very good and the retractable cord is nice because it keeps the cord out of the way."
3,"Work Great, But Poor Durability","These headphones are excellent. The sound quality is excellent, and the retractable cord is very useful. However, the retractable cord stopped working after about a month of normal use. The cord retracts without pushing the button. Also, only one of the headphones works now."
3,Nice headphones but not for running,I bought these headphones because earbuds do not stay in my ears. (born notchless)The sound quality is good and the retractable wire is nice......if you are not going to be running with them.The mechanism that allows these headphones to retract clicks loudly with every stepwhile you are running!For standard gym use they are fine.
3,Not exactly what I expected,"I have owned other clip on headphones (Philips, Panasonic) that I really enjoyed wearing and using. These Sony headphones, however, while performing all right - the bass is somewhat missing -, they just feel flimsy to me. The wiring is very thin gauge (probably because they retract) and I feel like I may break them is if I pull too hard on them. I will probably look for another headphone that is a bit more substantially constructed."
2,"Great idea, but not long lasting","I've had these for 4 months. They were amazing at first. I loved the retractable cord. But now, after 4 months of use, the cord is stuck always retracting (it's always pulling) and the rubber on the over-the-ear clips are peeling off, reveling hard pointy pieces of plastic that kinda hurt. The sound quality is good, the design is great, but the lack of durability downgrads this product greatly."
1,DO NOT BUY THEY BREAK EVERYTIME!,"I bought these headphones loving the idea that i would have a retractable cord. But, much to my dismay, the retraction system broke fairly quickly. I sent them back, got a new pair, and same thing happened again. I didn't feel like going through the process of return over and over and over again, so i just said screw it and bought other headphones. If only these guys were reliable, they'd be perfect..."
2,"Fine Sound For Price, but Junky Build","These headphones are fine in terms of sound quality when one considers the price. The biggest problems are as follows.1) The piece that clips to the ear has a very delicate rubber covering that will eventually peel off. While this doesn't make the headphone substantially less comfortable, it is annoying.2) The ""retractable cord"" broke fast, and in such a way that rather than keeping the cord extended at all times, it keeps it retracted. So you essentially have to fight your headphones to keep them usable. Oh, and you can't just let the cord move while you listen as doing so creates static."
4,Decent Pair of headphones,I was looking for a decent pair of headphones..based on the reviews this looked like the perfect pair. I immediately bought them without giving a thought and i am glad i did. I wear them for long hours so atleast for the first 3-4 hrs you dont even feel you are wearing one. Fits perfectly and sound quality is good. Seller service was also prompt.I would recommend this product and the seller.
4,Great for Compact use but not great bass.,"I use these with my Ipod and PSP Go. I also stopped using them with my computer because low bass quality. The old versions of these headphones were better, but not the worst trade for how compact and convenient these things are.Cons: Short CableNot a lot of BassPros: Can wear too work, because hat ring or Head ring looks badTravel great with PSP GoNO MORE CHORDS RUNNING AROUND MY MANTCHEL (just wanted to say Mantchel at least once....that's a Man Satchel or Manchel as I like to call it)Good Product but not greatest sound."
1,Would not purchase again,"We ordered two pairs and the whole problem is that they are much too loose on the ear so unless you hold it to your earyou loose all the base and 1/2 the sound. You can only adjust them so much and they are just too loose for us, especiallyif you are walking etc.. We just ordered 2 skull candy tiny ones that go over the head, they are so small you can hardly feel/see themand the sound quality is amazing."
2,Sony MDR-Q68LW Clip-on,I'm not a Sony fan. These things ear your ears if you wear them for more than an hour. I can't say the sound quality was bad but the comfort level made me toss them in a box. I still use them every once in awhile but they aren't for heavy duty listening.
2,Cord Too Short,"I had Sony over ear headphones for 4 years before this. I loved them! So I decided to order the updated version of them when they finally died. I use these to listen to music at work. The cord barely reaches from my computer to my head and I cannot move at all. The cord is ~39"", so if that works for you, then these are GREAT!! Otherwise, order something else."
2,Comfortable for a short time only.,"I tried using these for exercising but they are only comfortable for a short time. They do stay on my ears which is good. But, when I leave them on for extended times, ie. after my 30 minute workout, as I remove them, the part of my ear where these clip on aches, my guess is from these things pinching with just too much force. I wanted to like these, but in the end do not recommend them."
2,"Cool gadget, short cord",Works relatively good. The REALLY BIG PROBLEM is that the wire is too short. I regret buying this headphone. I will probably break it soon because it is too short and I stretch it all the time
4,where cool while they lasted,"I loved these they where very efficient until I gave them to my younger brother broke them in a month or so, take care of them and they'll last.I had them for over a year with no problem"
5,Clip-on,These headphones are very comfortable. I did not know if I would like the retractable cords but they are very convenient and tangled cords are a thing of the past.
3,"Work great, but now retracting is broken so can't use.","Love these headphones, they worked great for use at work. They are comfortable sound is ok, not spectacular, and I loved the retracting feature until it just broke. Now somehow the stopper on the retraction is broken so they are not able to be used anymore without putting something on the cord to prevent it from going back into the headphone. So annoying. I have only had these for less than a year, and I bought them on Amazon. Not purchasing again ugghhh. Back on the hunt for new headphones."
4,"Flexible, but not necessarily durable...","These are fantastic for day-to-day use if you don't feel like lugging around over-the-ear headphones and earbuds just aren't comfortable. Be careful working out with them, though, as the retractable cord eventually stopped retracting. I did put them through a fair amount of strenuous use before that happened, though, which is why they are still getting 4 stars and a solid review from me."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"These are perfect because I hate when the headphones get tangled up. I considered the mini winder (skylab products), but I didn't think headphones would work; even if they did, the cord was still long between the headphones. I dislike earbuds since after a while, my ear hurts.These, however, are perfect. They are headphones and I can adjust the cord between the two headphones between the music player and the headphones. It's thin, so I'm just afraid they may break if I'm not careful. The sound works for me (I'm not a constant music listener, but need to memorize some songs for school). The length works for me as well, although it's not terribly long.I highly recommend them, unless one is very, very picky with headphone specifics."
4,Why did I mess with wires for so long?,"This self retracting stuff is great. I much prefer over-the-ear headphone/earbuds for my ipod - I just don't like things ""in"" my ear. I've had some before. They were fine. Everything wears out over time. Picked these up - love the way it self-manages the wires. Bit of a knack you need to acquire to put them on one-handed - but once you get it, it is easy. Sounds good. Looks good. easy to use. What more could you ask for. In general - fit will vary a bit with the shape of your ear. If you have very small ears, you may need to tinker with these a bit - just guessing."
4,B+,"There are 2 issues I have with this item; 1- The wire is too short as mentioned by other consumers. I am just under 6'1"" and when I have my player in my front or back pocket it pulls just a bit. 2-The headphones don't stay on very snug when lying down. It is not that big on an issue but if you are doing any sort of workout that requires lying on a bench you get the feeling that the headphones are about to come off (but they stay on well). Other than that sound is great and storage is way easy."
4,Fragile but functional,"I bought these after struggling with any number of other headphone and earbud configurations.I prefer an over-the-ear headphone. These are comfortable, have sound better than many headphones offered at similar prices. I do like how they retract both the cable that plugs into your music device, but also the cable between the headphones.The fragile parts of the headphones seem to be the wires themselves which are surprisingly small and the retraction mechanism. I'm happy with it now, but I suspect they will have a premature death when one of these weak spots fails.In summary I think I got a great product and a good value, even when considering my concerns about the fragility."
5,"The most ""F""ing Awesome Headphone",I've been using cord retracting headphones since high school (so it's like almost 5-6 years ago).They are no comparison to regular headsets. The cord retracting ability is the smartest invention on earth.You can wear them around your neck like a necklace and not worry about cord tangling everywhere!Sound quality is also very satisfactory! Of course it's not comparable to Dr. Dre's Beat but for a clip-on? It's decent enough alright?But to be careful when handling them tho! I've broke one set before and all it took was a drop from my pocket! And it lost its cord retracting ability... with essentially made it worthless!
4,"So far, mostly good","I like them a lot, the sound is good and I LOVE the retractable cords. I am a little concerned about the thickness of the cord though and I would have prefered a 90 degree plug. They are really nice if you are using them while moving around. They fit into a pocket with ease.However, they are not comfortable to use for long periods of time. I tried to wear them at work, but after several hours of use, the clips hurt my ears. So I use the Sony MDR-Q22LP model for long periods of time."
4,One of my favorites,"Sound quality is decent, while the ear wraps are a little loose, they don't really bother me much. The retractable cords have never given me any problems. I've had these for going on 5 years, and I'm finally getting ready to buy another set."
4,"Great sound, comfortable, but they feel kind of cheap.","The retraction is pretty nice. They feel a lot cheaper than the previous sony over-the-ear model. Also, sometimes when you're jogging you can actually hear the cord move around (since it's retractable and there are moving parts in there.) It's not too bad though. Over all, awesome sound, comfortable, and they clip nice and tight onto the ear (without hurting at all)."
4,Cord is to short,"These headphones were the replacement for an older version of these. I thought the cord on the older version was to long, and I think that on these the cord is about two inches to short. I am 6 feet tall and I cannot keep my iPod in my pocket when out walking and listening to music with these on, it keeps pulling on my ears."
4,Not perfect but well worth your money,"Figured since I'm buying like my 8th pair of these that maybe I should write up a little review. I'm not an audiophile expert but they sound nice to my ears for the price. Great for on the go, no more tangled wires! That said, I wish someone would improve on the design. As other reviews have stated, the cord could be longer. They will eventually fall apart after a lot of use, I can usually get about 4-6 months out of them before they lose tension and the ear pads start to strip away. But when they work, I dare you to find a better pair of retractable clip-on style headphones. I'm baffled why there aren't other options out there, some of us don't care for earbuds.Oh, and maybe some new colors? Last time I could order red but the hell I'm going to pay another $30+ for that"
4,Head phones,Headphones sound great. They don't stay on your ears very well. The ear holders need to be a little stronger.
4,PURTY GOOD,"PROS-CLEAR - no buzzing or any other annoying noise-RETRACTABLE! - The cords retract into the headphones - say goodbye to rubber bands!-GOOD FIT - I have a big head with big ears, and they fit alrightCONS-CORD - it is a bit short, I am 6'3"", and when I wear them and have my ipod in my pocket, I have to be careful not to move around too freely.-NOT EXERCISE FRIENDLY - As above, cord is too short.BUY IT? - Yes, but only for casual wear. I don't suggest using them for exercising.OTHER - I cannot comment on anything about the actual musical quality, for I am tone death."
3,No good enough for me.,"The sound was mediocre for my taste. I need better sound and bass. Therefore, I could not use this headphone--ever."
4,Great for what I needed,I was looking for some decent sounding headphones that I could also pack up and take anywhere I go. With the zip up cords it keeps those damned cables from tangling themselves together and keeps me from spending an hour before listening to music untangling. They sound great for the size of the earphones and cables. So if you're looking for portability with decent sound you came to the right place.
2,too bulky,"The sound was excellent but it was too bulky and too heavy, the headphones kept falling off my ears!"
1,the worst head phones ever,"the slide in thing stop working, the sound is the worst sound becouse you can hear everything around you and not what your listening to. the worst. 0.1"
4,Nice headphones,"The clips are nice. However, they require a bit more movement to get them open as they swivel somewhat parallel the ear piece, rather than out from them. I'm used to my Panasonic RP-HS43 Clip-Ons that hug my ear nicely and the clip opens easily."
2,Clips on ears are so tight they hurt.,"Sound quality is good, Ilike the retractable for keeping the wires from getting tangled, but ear hooks are way to tight."
4,Ear phones that are easy to store,They work as expected. The sound is good and they are comfortable to wear.They are vert easy to zip up the cords and put in your pocket.
3,Good Sound,"The sounds is good, comfort on ears is great.However, the cord that goes from the item you are attaching it to, to your ear set is too short. I need a headset for my computer. This cord is 36 inches long...is good for ipods, etc, but too short for computer use."
4,THERE GREAT,The wight are very light so they will not feel heavy on your ear and the fact that the wire retract is very good the clib may feel a little tit but it's not that big of a deal.my only problem for not given 5 is that the volume is normal it's not that high but you can still hear it non the less.
3,Wish they actually clipped to ear,"The sound is fine and I still prefer them over buds that go in the ear, however when running they don't stay in place. I have to wear a skin cap while jogging to hold them in place. Some padded gator clips or something like that would be nice."
4,Mostly Great!,"I really like these earphones. The only downside is that after a few hours of wearing them at work, they start to make my ears sore. It's not, too bad, though, and overall worth it."
3,Short wire,Wire too short. a little uncomfortable over time. Works well as far as sound and remaining on when running or exercising.
3,"Pleased with my purchase, but.......","Positives:1. The headphones don't get tangled up in your gym bag, love that!2. The sound is perfect, best I've heard in a while3. Lightweight4. Reasonable price5. I am left handed, so the cord being on the left side ear piece is a plus even though the over all cord is short!Negatives: ""Just one""1. If you don't have the volume turned up enough, the headphones rattle a bit, I can hear it when I run."
3,STylish n' just that.,"I mainly had bought this because of its looks. Well, that's just what I got. It looks great but the sound quality is not worth discussing. And it's such a hassle when I have to get it on and off. Besides, after few weeks, the retractor kind of gets stuck and does not fulfill its job as well. The wire length is way shorter than I thought it would be. Not really recommended for activities, it's likely to fall off (well at least for me)."
4,Decent in this price range,"I hate earbuds but I do like the convenience of not having headband style headphones and these are the kind I get most often. The sound quality is pretty decent in it's price range, although if you can stand things in your ears, you might likeSkullcandy S2TTBZ-CZ Titan Earbuds, (Chrome)better. The sound quality is much better. I just really hate having things in my ears.Mostly, I love these. The cord retracts very well and the sound quality is good enough for my uses. I would have given them 5 stars except they need replacing too often. The rubber on the ear pieces tend to start peeling up after a while which exposes the plastic under it to the sensitive skin behind your ears.I can use these comfortably with glasses, and my ears are set fairly close to my head. I've never had any problems with the cords not retracting or any other issues with them other than that rubber issue, and for the price, they are easy enough to replace."
3,Work well but are too loose,"I can't wear earbuds because they hurt my ears and I seem to always tangle my headphone cords into a tight knot-filled wad of plastic, so when I saw these headphones on Amazon I was sold. And overall I'm pretty happy with them. I love the retractable cord - it makes the headphones neat and compact when I put them back in my bag. I also like the color and ease of use. My only complaint is the way that they fit on my ear. They are a little difficult to put on and once on, they are very loose. Because of the loose fit, it's easier to hear outside noise making it harder to hear the music. But if I turn up the music loud enough, I think the sound quality is pretty good. Another drawback is that they fall off of my ear while jogging."
3,Retractable but far too bulky and heavy,"Most earsets come with too much chord, and since I got a new MP3 player for exercising, I figured I'd keep things sleeker and cleaner-looking with a retractable deal. Retraction works fine and is cool, but the earpieces themselves are very bulky and feel wobbily on your ears. As you bounce up and down while jogging (especially when running over rough terrain and get jolted more), they tend to fold your ears forward and start sliding off. The sound quality was good and I liked the straight jack. The casing showed fingerprints too much and didn't wipe clean very well with my shirt. I also felt I looked like an alien with these massive objects covering my ears. I ended up going with the non-retractable Nike Vapor, which has minimal chord, an extension in case you need it longer, they fit super snugly and comfortably to the ear, the sound is good and they're compact and look cool and sleek. I'll save the retractable setup for plane trips."
3,Good Quality but the short cord is a dealbreaker,"I purchased these because I couldn't stand the lack of comfort of earbuds but wanted the flexibility of not having something wrapped around your head all the time. These sound pretty good for the price and the fact that the cord retracts is awesome, but unfortunately the cord is just too short. I'm 5'10"" and the cable barely reaches the pocket of my jeans while plugged into my phone. On multiple occasions while wearing these I've caught the cable on something because there is no slack and it has either come disconnected from the phone or pulled the phone out of my pocket. I've kept these as a backup but they are just too much of a pain to be my primary set of portable headphones."
3,Good as long as you are not jogging/running,"These headphones are good if you are sitting, walking, or doing some other activity that does not bounce you around. The retractable cord is very convenient. But I wouldn't recommend running while wearing them- they do not stay on your ears well, become uncomfortable after a while, and you can actually hear the retracted part of the cord clicking inside the headphone as you run."
2,Okay for awhile,I bought these headphones because i needed a new pair after my other headphones i had for 7 years just stopped working i love the price good value and loved the sound but the one problem i had was after just 2 months of using them something inside the headphones broke so it was always retracting and wouldn't stay after i messed with it for awhile it would. and one day i went to retract the cord and it broke out of the left ear piece. If you want a good price then buy these headphones but if your looking for more durable ones get something else these head phones will not last
1,No good,Lasted 3 months before the right started going out. Way too heavy to use at the gym. They don't fit tightly enough on the ears to be heard when there is background noise.
4,No more knots or snags!,"These headphones are pretty nice. Push the button on the side for the cords to retract into the earpieces. The cord on the left piece connects the headphones to your player and the cord on the right piece connects to the left piece. With this kind of set up I can control the length of the cord behind my head and get the right length to reach my iPod. With a shorter cord, I couldn't keep the player in my pants pocket while listening to it. With a much too long cord, it would get tangled in my bag and snag on my bike handles. The cords on this model make a clicking sound when being lengthened and have yellow bands near the end of their extents to keep you from over extending them.I love that they sit outside my ears since the bud styles hurt my ears and tend to fall out while exercising. It may take some adjusting to get them in the right position as the clips are spring loaded and can put an uncomfortable amount of pressure on the ears if not positioned well."
5,The Retractable Cord is Awesome!,"Bought these for my brother for Christmas and they exceeded expectations. He can't wear any style of earbud because of his ear shape but I wanted something that he could fit in his pocket. These fit the bill. I didn't really pay much attention to the fact that the cord was advertised to be retractable, but that was his favorite part of the headphone and I was jealous that my earbuds don't have anything to retract into! He can control the amount of slack of wire around his ears and the cord can extend to be pretty lengthy. He lost them about a week after I bought them, so I'm getting him another pair. They are definitely a well-designed product."
2,Useful only if you're going to sit still,"I replaced my old pair of Sony earphones (Sony MDR-Q22LP) with these, thinking that having a cord recoil mechanism would be helpful - not so much.Pros:- They stay on your ears pretty well and are comfortable enough.- Sound quality is decent, but not as good as my old Sony clip on earphones.- Wire is nice thin and doesn't both you while wearing.Cons:- You hear the recoil winding mechanism for the cord if you move your head at all, especially bad if you're using for running or fitness purposes.- A bit heavy on one's ears.If you're looking for clip on earphones for fitness, I would recommend sticking with the Sony MDR-Q22LP."
4,Works perfectly,"A really good headphone; stylish, small, light, and comfortable. Only downside is that the volume is amazingly low compared to the other headphones I've used so far.Overall, this is a good headphone that can be carried anywhere and leaves no mess as long as you retracts the cord."
2,Dissatisfied due to weak bass,"I bought this headset hoping that the larger size speakers would give good bass response, because I have been unable to find earbuds with good bass. Unfortunately, unless you press the speakers against your ears, the bass is no better than earbuds. Mid and high frequency sound quality is acceptable."
2,Not good for tiny ears,"I bought these searching for headphones to use while running. The bud-type earphones pop out of my ears, and my old Sony earphones (the kind with a bud, and adjustable ear hook) broke, so I needed to find a new pair.I bought these last month. Unfortunately, I am really disappointed with them. I must have really small ears, because the ear hook comes down past my ear, and into my jaw/cheek. My biggest complaint is that they fall off while I'm doing sit-ups, and bounce against my ears while I run. They are fine while lifting weights, and are mostly okay while I'm on the elliptical, unless I get too bouncy. Overall, they are not as ideal to working out as I thought they would be. Although I love the convenience of the retractable cord, I wish I could return these. For me, they were not worth the money I spent on them."
4,"Lightweight headphone, cord a little short, good sound quality","These are very handy headphones. Lightweight so I can wear them a few hours before my ears start to complain. They stay on easily when I tilt my head. Only complaint is the main cord between device and headset is not that long, 3ft. Perfect for mobile use, not as convenient on the office computer. I bought these for office use, so unsure how they stay on when walking around. And they don't cramp my hair style. I'm keeping them."
2,Terrible sound quality,"I had the Koss KSC75 clip-on headphones before I bought this pair. The sound quality was great on those but they never lasted more than 6 months, so I tried this Sony pair. The sound quality is abysmal compared to the Koss headphones. It's like all the quality escapes out of the sides or something. They sound good when you press them against your ear, but obviously that is a ridiculous option. Maybe I'll see if the newer Koss models are more durable. I certainly won't be buying another pair of Sony headphones."
2,Was satisfied but not anymore,"I bought these headphones in May and at first I was happy. They retract well and fit over the ears well. As many have said, though, the cord is too short (by about a foot or so). But the main problem is that now, about 5 months from purchase, the sound spurts in and out of the left side. Since I bought them 5 months ago, the 90-day limited warranty will do nothing for me. Thanks a lot Sony. Potential customers beware!"
2,"Small and comfortable, but weak.","I am not an audiophile by any means. I picked these up to listen to streaming music in my office, hoping to replace my older Koss KSC75 headphones. The MDR-Q68LQs are small, lightweight and comfortable. I have no complaints with the actual physical construction of the headphones. Unfortunately the minute I put them on everything sounded flat. Considering I'm listening to streaming internet radio, it's going to take a lot to make such a low quality stream sound comparatively bad.Everything is extremely muted, the bass being the worst off. Just to see if I was mistaken I plugged in my old pair. I had to crank up the volume on the MDR-Q68LQs just to get them loud enough to compare to my Koss KSC75s.I'm still in the market for a suitable replacement for my aging headphones."
4,almost,"its good for what it is, the most portable headphones. still for the next design, id suggest a mic for smartphones, and maybe some leather padding and a longer and stronger cable."
3,sony,"I like them for the price I really only use them when I fly and the the way they fold up is great, on the bad side they are very flimsy so I know they wont last long; You win some you lose some."
5,"Complete, accurate and well-written.","The author accomplished the goal of presenting this broad and many-faceted subject in a thorough and comprehensive manner. Beginning from the fundamentals of ODE theory to the most sophisticated methods for solving important PDE's of mathematical physics, this series of three volumes comprises all what a modern analyst must know about the topic and much more.The contents of volume 1 are: Basic theory of ODE; Laplace and wave equations; Fourier analysis, distributions, and constant-coefficient linear PDE; Sobolev spaces; linear elliptic equations; linear evolution equations. Appendices: Outline of functional analysis; manifolds, vector bundles, and Lie groups.Originally intended for graduate students and working mathematicians, most of the material is suitable for advanced undergraduate courses. Includes excercises for each section and extensive references."
5,quick,"It came to me almost the next day, and works fast and smooth. It also helped me tune with precision."
2,This is not a durable product,"This iron is such a waste. I have had it for about a year and it worked fine. All of a sudden, the on switch stopped working. In order to iron, you have to shake the iron, wait for the light to come on, hold the on switch, hope that it will heat up and iron while holding the switch. That is way too much work in order to iron It has an automatic turn off, but it hardly works. It doesn't have a steam button, either. Just a spray button which you have to push several times. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!"
2,Look elseware,"I bought a similar steam express iron 18 months ago. It worked great until three months ago---then the auto-shutoff feature started malfunctioning. With so many negative reviews on this site, B&D should really do something about this issue. My next iron (purchased at Target today!) is a Panasonic N52. I hope to have better luck with it."
2,Don't Buy It!,"The name, Black & Decker, is a well-respected name, but this product does not live up to the standard. I used this iron for a few weeks then it started turning off at will. When this happens, the water is dumped out all over your clothes. When it steams, it's very good. I tried plugging & unplugging and waiting the 1-2 minutes for it to warm up but had no luck. This has got to be a defect. I'm contacting Black & Decker."
1,irons good - doesn't hold up,I purchased 1 and then B & D replaced it with another (shorted out). Irons good but both of them went out.
2,disappointed,"This SteamXpress iron works well, but one of the primary features I purchased it for is also the cause of its demise. The iron features a storage base to accommodate wrapping the cord. While this feature is handy and keeps the cord out of the way, the reinforced portion of the cord where it connects to the iron was not sturdy enough thus a short in the wire is the result of wrapping the cord around the base."
1,Shortage In Iron,"Like most of the other reviewers, I also purchased this iron. It irons clothes perfectly -- does a really good job of removing wrinkles. However, I am now experiencing the same problem with the iron; it cuts on and off at will. It behaves like a spoil baby or toddler that will only turn on if I hold it in my hand and then as soon as I put it down it cuts off.If you are considering purchasing an iron look elsewhere, the lifetime of this iron seems to be about a year or less."
1,Only if it worked,"The first time I bought the iron, it shorted within a week. It would auto shut-off every minute. I called Black & Decker customer support and they asked me to return it for a replacement. I was ok with the replacement but it started behaving just the same (auto shut-off) within two weeks. I called them again, and they replaced it again. The sequence of calling and returning continued for a while (I had five irons replaced!). The fifth one did work for over one and half years. But last night, it shorted out again. Had a tough time deciding what to wear this morning to work! I am definitely not buying a Black & Decker iron again."
3,Worked for a Decade,"My mother gave me a Black & Decker SteamXPress 680 as a gift over 10 years ago. The balance is ideal, the weight incedibly light, and the settings are consistent with the readings. I have put it through the ringer - abusing it like none other, including dropping it numerous times. I have used hard water and scented linen water for steaming, and it still didn't become gunked up or rusty. With the plate's non-stick coating, I never had problems with starch build-up. It finally started to have problems as it approached year 11 of use: the automatic shutoff has become entirely too touchy, shutting off the second you turn the iron horizontal and place it on the clothes. There is an audible ""click"" when it switches off. If you continue to hold the iron horizontally after it shuts off, the iron cools relatively quickly and it begins to leak. A rather unfortunate end to what has become a beloved old friend. I do not look forward to finding a suitable replacement."
1,Won't stay on,I was looking for the user's manual when I found these reviews. Same thing as all the others. The iron won't stay on now. The only reason it has worked for about 6 years is that I didn't use it often. Only in the last six months have we used it frequently. So it's worth about six months of use
1,It stops working after a couple years!!!,"I have had the very same problem that others listed. After a few years of use, the on switch just refuses to stay in the on position. What horrible quality!!!"
2,Won't buy Black &amp; Decker again,"I had the same problem as others did. After about 2 years, the iron won't stay on in the upright (veritical) position. It turns off. It stays on in the horizontal position, while ironing, as long as the cord doesn't jiggle. As soon as you set it down to move clothing, it clicks and shuts off. The steam was good on the iron.....but I will NOT buy another Black &amp; Decker iron again !!!"
5,Sensual,"One Christmas, a few years ago, my daughter decided to color coordinate my gift. I had recently mentioned to her that I liked how the colors brown and rose looked together and that I wanted to wear more of that blend. So she decided all of my little gifts would each be something of a brown or rose color. She found the purse sized bottle of Voluspa Cocoa Tamarind at one of her favorite shops on Newbury St in Boston, the little satin pouch a perfect match of brown and rose. I was thrilled with my gifts that year, not only because she had put so much thought into it, but I so fell in love with that perfume! When I ran out of it, I couldn't find it anywhere so I looked online and have been buying it through Amazon ever since.The scent itself is a wonderful, sensual earthy fragrance that is simple enough for every day use and seductive enough for a night on the town. In a word - delicious!Thank you Weebee!GWBoston"
2,"Stuff you already know...""","This was required reading for a nursing class. I diligently plugged through the Chapters but there was not a lot of ""valuable"" new information. It provides some history of nursing and related figures but most of the guidelines are common sense. Unless you have to buy it, save your $$$; however, I will say the authors of this book have put out some GREAT mnemonic flash cards for a variety of nursing topics (meds esp) which I LOVE and use regularly so def. check those out!"
2,waste of money,I only bought this book because it was required for school and if I would have looked at it ahead of time I wouldn't have wasted my money. 95% of the information in this book is common sense. If your a nursing student don't waste time on this book.
4,Never really used it,"I bought this book for a class that it was required for, but we never really used it. What I did read in the book seemed like really good information. The book was in wonderful shape."
3,nursing student book...,"This book was required for my first year in the nursing program. The instructors skimmed through it and like any textbook, it was boring reading. The history of nursing was fairly interesting in the beginning but I never saw the content on my NCLEX-PN board nor the class lecture exams. If you are buying it just to read, have fun with that! If you think it will help you move up in the nursing program, good luck with that!"
2,Nursing Today: Transition & Trends,"This book is required reading. So far, I'm disappointed. The author's time management suggestions rely heavily on delegation, the pitfall of all other time management seminars I've attended. While some of them have merit, it author doesn't take into account that money is an issue when it comes to hiring out tasks, or that dry cleaning or grocery delivery isn't an option in rural areas, even if money weren't an object. However, I'm only a few chapters in. Perhaps it will get better."
1,A Catered Catastrophe,"Cardboard, boring characters who do nothing but bicker constantly about nothing. Plot? Not in this book. Save your money. Buy something else, anything else. I think this is the first book in decades that I'll have given up on before finishing it!"
3,Fair to middling,"I picked this up because I'm a sucker for Christmas books, particulary mysteries. And I liked the catering angle. Overall, it was a decent book, but the Christmas angle was definitely beside the point. It could have easily have been set at any time of year, as the murder itself had nothing to do with Christmas.I also found it very confusing -- Apparently, this is the third book in the series, but there was virtually no backstory provided on any of the main characters. As a result, it took me several chapters to get everyone sorted out.Another element that bothered me was the fact that every suspect seemed to be in on knowledge that ""everyone knows about"" EXCEPT our sleuths. That was really confusing. If the food biz is such a small world, wouldn't they know what was going on, too?Anyway, a quick read, and fun. But I probably won't pick up another one from the series anytime soon."
2,Skip it,"This 'mystery' is drab, slow moving, and all-around irritating. The main characters are hardly likeable and the plotline is quite unbelievable. Once I got far enough into the book to realize it is not going to pick up or become any more entertaining, I felt trapped into skimming the rest of it just to find out 'whodunnit.' Pass on this series!"
1,Too Much Bickering,"I had high hopes for this book. I love Christmas murder mysteries and had not read the first two books in this series.The constant bickering turned me off immediately. I could not continue.I know the author meant for it to be funny, but it was so incessant that I actually ended up returning the book for credit with Amazon.The series has a nice premise, but the characters were too poorly drawn to keep me interested."
5,Fun read,"I enjoyed A Catered Christmas very much. I would like to read more of Isis Campbell's work and will be watching for it to be released on Kindle.It was written with a constantly changing Point of View so that you know how everyone is interacting and how they feel about each other. It sounds like it would be very confusing, but it was actually very easy to follow, and added quite a bit to the whole story.Lots of twists and turns. Excellent read. If you like cozies, I believe you will like this book. I'm looking forward to more from Isis Crawford."
2,Basically Boring!,"I had to read this book for school, which always makes reading it more difficult because I knew I would have to write about it. The story of Antony and Cleopatra is a tragic one and better then fiction but Dryden makes it uninteresting and in blank verse which makes the writing dull and prolonged. In fact, I would've stopped reading half way through if I wasn't required to read the whole thing. Trust me, there are better ""classic books"" out there! Dont pick this one!"
5,Jump Start Your Marriage,"This video is an excellent vehicle for learning about the mechanics of relationships, both those that work and those that don't (or at least is not working some of the time). It's based on years of research with a wide range of couples. I recommend regularly. Watch it together. Take about what you both are doing well and what you think YOU could do better. A terrific investment of an hour of your life! Good luck. This book is also terrific if you have the time to read more.The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work: A Practical Guide from the Country's Foremost Relationship Expert"
3,Didn't really work for me,"Despite all the positive reviews, unfortunately I was underwhelmed by this DVD. Yes, Gottman has done years of research. No doubt it's valuable science. But something about this video didn't work for me. Maybe it just was expecting more given all the accolades his books have gotten. I suppose it was just an overview of his theory which he covers in more depth in the book. I found a lot of the advice to be common sense.If you're looking for an easy-to-watch marriage tips DVD, then I recommend this. But if you want something more in depth, then you might want to consider the full book or one of the followingGetting the Love You Want: A Guide for Couples, 20th Anniversary Edition(for understanding our unconscious needs in a relationship) and/orThe Couple's Survival Workbook: What You Can Do To Reconnect With Your Partner and Make Your Marriage Work(if your marriage is really struggling)."
4,"Good enough, but.....","I bought this coupled with the newer Dolls bio, ""Trash! The Complete New York Dolls"", and found ""Too Much Too Soon"" is more personal than ""Trash..."". It's prob'ly because the author Nina Antonia is a Johnny Thunders fanatic. Being personal can be good in a way that it is very deteiled about a small but funny episode like JT puked in the airport in front of the press in France, but can be bad to be too emotional about the band, which makes the whole book invalidate. Chlonologically, this book covers members' childhood until Jerry Nolan's death, while ""Trash...."" covers until 2004 reunion and beyond. I enjoyed reading it, but I prob'ly have to give ""Trash...."" more credit since it covers longer period, and Jerry Nolan and Arthur Kane more than this book does."
5,Fantastic!,This is a fantastic book! I love it. It has all the information you need to start using video in the classroom. Dan Greenwood also provides his website with a lot of information to download and use in the classroom. Great book!
5,What a great cymbal!!,"To all drummers out there: This cymbal needs to be yours. Great balance, sound, and attack.The perfect sound, right on the money. Makes me wanna go play mine now!"
2,Too many errors - who edited this book???,"There are too many long, drawn out references to the banking industry, stocks, and how the financial world operates for this to be a fast-paced novel. Speed reading ... I don't think so.Getting back to why I am writing this review, there are numerous errors in the book, i.e., a word left out that completes a sentence, references to his lover when it should have been her lover; in one chapter Kym is talking to an opium addict then in the very next paragraph she is walking down the street in a old woman's outfit getting ready to go into the opium den. There is no transition here ... it just doesn't make sense.I really feel like noting all the pages with errors and sending them to the author so this book can be corrected if it is reprinted.I am an avid reader, fiction and non-fiction, and usually don't complain about the books but I felt I really needed to in this instance."
1,Not able to sync contacts.,The cable did contact the phone and computer but it is not able to access phone book...
1,Horrible,"The ad they had shown was for a nextel usb cable but when I recevied it, it was the wrong cable! I've tried to get in touch with them mulitple times and no one returns my emails. So in conclusion I WILL NEVER order from this company again. If I wanted to waste money I could just burn it."
2,Not what I thought it was,I thought it was a cord that u can transfer ringtones and other stuff but it just some program that will upgrade the phone and that didnt even work it kept saying error.
1,Does not fit the i836,The plug that connects to the phone is much larger than the original Motorola product and does not make contact because of the poor fit.
3,Eforcity USB Cable,"Cable was shipped timely and received. The software CD a copy not what was shown in the picture, which I don't mind, but is was not the software. It was ""instructions"" on how to download the drivers to your computer. It is not easy to follow and I have not been able to use my USB Cord. I am fairly savvy in computers and this instructional CD is not helpful."
3,Good in a pinch,"My iron decided to break just as I was about to iron a shirt that was to be worn to attend a wedding...what to do?! Grabbed this steamer that's been sitting in our laundry room just waiting to be used. The shirt would have looked better had it been ironed, but this steamer did get out the most obvious wrinkles and left the shirt presentable. Word of warning though, follow the instructions! If you keep pressing on the steam button to get more steam so that you can try and work faster, the steamer will spit on your garment."
2,Dual volt use ?,"Being a travel steamer iron, it must be suitable to use with 110 V and 220 V. in certain countries. This apect is not mentioned by the manufacturer specs, nor the review by author, and a customer."
5,Midwest Puppy play pen helps keep puppys off the cold floor and keeps them from running in there own mess,"Midwest Puppy play pen everything was fine with the cage part but the pans had top edge broken, but was still able to use them"
2,Defective,This pen arrived with a panel that had been installed upside down. In general it doesn't seem to be the same quality as the Precision Puppy Pen- I own one of those as well.I will update with how the return goes.
4,Safety beam sensors worked well,"Resolved the problem of not able to close the garage door by remote, in a few minutes. Old sensor quit working and had to hold the wall switch until the door closes. The new one helped to avoid the issue. If you knew how to wire them without relying much on the two pages material on 'how to do it by yourself', you can do it in a few minutes. The two pages material is not up to my expectations as it was not the original but from a copier that produces all the pictures in black!.The one star is missing only for the poor reference notes. If the manufacturer can take care of the marketing issue, it can help to get all five stars. Thanks."
4,Genie Garage door sensor,Great Price and shipping. I was in a bind to get my garage door fixed and this part did the trick!!
5,Another Satisfied Customer,"Lightning strike took out my garage door system. On the insurance claim the technician quoted these same replacement lights on the parts list at $44.00. I bought them for $24.00 from Amazon, took the old ones off, wired these in, and the garage door was working again!"
1,both were were bad,I received two only ordered one both were bad I spent two hours on the phone with the help department of Genie with no success finally went to Lows and bought a new one and repaired the system. Tried to reach the seller but no replay. Very disappointed
2,If you need the mounting hardware and / or wires do not buy,The product description is inaccurate (ONLY the sensors are included).My system was about 14yrs old and used a different style sensor that uses a totally different mounting system for the newer sensors.The good news the old and new sensors are compatible. I only bothered swapping out the defective sensor.I was able to craft a mount that would not be easy for most to do.
2,Genie Garage Door Safety Beam Sensors,"I received the product within a few days. I was very unhappy that only the sensors themselves came. I was led to believe that it was a full installation kit including the sensors, brackets and wire. The buyer is misled to believe this. The sensors did work but I still have yet to purchase the brackets and wire to properly install the safety beam sensors."
1,Not a Kit as in the description,"Unlike other reviewers, I did not receive wire, brackets, or anything else besides two sensors. The sensors were the same as the pictures. There are two screws on the back of each sensor for wires. What a waste of 5 bucks shipping when I return it. Should've went with a kit that offered prime shipping."
2,pruduct not as discribed,It says it comes with wire and brackets which it didn't. Luckily I was able to use what was there. The eyes worked fine. I blame Amazon for not reviewing the adds. It says kit not eyes only.
5,"Fast service, works as advertised",Can't beat the price and I see no difference in performance compared to the orignal part. (Genie 35048R safety beam sensors)
3,BEWARE!,"BEWARE! It shows the kit (includes brackets and wire) but lists ""sensors only"" so go get sucked in if you need the whole kit. Read carefully."
2,False advertisement,"I will say that the items are fine and work well. However, the ad states that it is the kit meaning it will have the brackets, wires etc. This is not the case, there were only the 2 sensors. This would have been fine, but don't advertise a ""kit"" when all you have are the sensor. Other buyers may want the brackets and wires that are supposed to come with them."
1,Not what I expected,"Unfortunately this product did not include all the parts needed for installation, like the brackets, and this was not clear from the product description.,"
4,A Van Vogt Classic,"This book is a Van Vogt classic! It has all the action adventure, plot twists, and trippy stuff that one would expect from Van Vogt. The only point that keeps this from being 'five star' is that the plot sort of skips a bit at the end. Overall though, this is classic Van Vogt, right up there with Space Beagle and 'Null-A'"
5,I Love This Spelling Book,"As a homeschool Mom, I have never been happy with any of the spelling books I've used in the past. They were always too much. This book is just right -- the right words, the right amount of work, and the right content that holds my son's attention. I use ""The Well Trained Mind"" method and this works beautifully with it."
5,Great for homeschool spelling,"I am using this for my daughter (7, 2nd grade). Once we got used to the format, she was able to do most of the work independently (other than the pre- and post- tests). I cannot speak to the teacher's edition, because I don't have it, but we seem to have muddled through fine without it. We didn't use SW A, but we plan to continue with this series."
4,I think its a great book,"I think this book is great, I use this one and the level A book as well. I also use additional spelling resources but this book can stand on its own. I have my oldest son write down the pep talks to help him remember the rules, I haven't found anything else on the market that comes close for me for homeschoolers."
4,"Wonderful content, great reference source.","Gary Blake and Robert Bly do a great job of bringing the core of copywriting. I find this book more a reference than something I am going to read cover to cover. Great coverage of Direct Mail and writing for the web, all around very useful book in helping my customers become more profitable - plus improve my own sales and marketing materials.Only caveat, the paragraphs could use a bit more space between them and some other font for headlines would make it easier to read. Outside of that the content is superb!"
2,"Lather, Rinse, Repeat, & Repeat, & Repeat...","I don't normally leave book reviews, but I was forced into reading this for my journalism class and it was an utter waste of my time. If you know anything about writing and advertising - that is, if you have ever read a magazine or seen an ad on the side of a bus - you should already know the things that are written in this book. It is mostly all just common sense. And every single point made in the book was said at least 162 times over and over and over and over - and not even in a new and interesting way! It was so frustrating, my blood pressure rises just thinking about it. Do yourself a favor and avoid this book, get the cliff notes if you can - the points they make are relevant, just way too obvious, and they are SO OFTEN repeated that someone out there must have caught on and compacted the main points down to something with more readability to it.... Sorry for the negativity, but I hate when my time is wasted."
1,FUNNY YOU SHOULD PLACE WITH ROY WILLIAMS BOOK,"I DIDN'T ORDER THE BOOK AFTER READING THE REVIEWS AND THE TABLE OF CONTENTS AS I AM AN AVID READER OF ROY WILLIAMS WORKS. IF YOU READ HIS BOOKS HE MENTIONS ""A LITTLE BIT"" ABOUT HOW TO USE PRINT; HOWEVER, HIS PRIMARY FOCUS, IN MY OPINION, IS HOW TO USE THE POWER OF SOUND IN BROADCAST ADVERTISING. THE QUICKEST WAY INTO THE CUSTOMER'S MIND IS THROUGH THE EAR AND BROCA. I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD FIND THAT IN HOW TO WRITE BROCHURES, HEADLINES, ETC."
3,A decent square,"Most remixes, despite being mixed much, work here because the original material worked well, though at nine tracks with two double shots, few selections rise above the sound of fan pandering."
3,horse figurine,not very realistic if that's what your going for. The hooves are not anatomically correct. Next time I will go with Papo toys instead.
5,Ned Goold performs circa '99,"Bebop had tenuous links with avant-garde arts groups such as painters like Pollock, poets such as Ginsberg, and authors like Kerouac and Ellison. They had in common an attitude opposed to the dominant postwar culture and a belief in spontaneity within creative fields.More important to their artistic status is the ethos behind their artistic creations, rather than who the audence was or how the art was received. These groups were avant-garde on the basis of their purpose.Sweet Entropy!"
4,Fun Shirt,"Great shirt. The material is thick and the picture is cool. The sizing is right on. Huge fan of the Great Pyrenees and love to have shirts to show it off. After a while of washing the picture did melt off, unfortunately. Boo! Would still recommend buying but do not dry on high."
4,At Least Three Or Four Songs You Will Want,"The band is tight and there are a lot of very good songs in here.Some highlights are:Black Is Black with Raul Malo,Dave Alvin's California Sun in his deep bass voice,Two country classics:A tender, surf-tinged version of Skeeter Davis' The End Of The World by Leigh Nash, andExene Cervenka rocking the Bill Anderson / Porter Wagoner classic, I'll Go Down Swinging.Great for rockin' down the highway."
4,Looking for Raul Malo in all the right places,"I bought this album just to get Raul Malo's version of ""Black is Black."" As it turned out, I am enjoying the entire album. It's a bit ""off-center"" like only the British groups can be but the musicianship is obvious and delightful."
1,a boring and poorly told story of this amazing event,"I am so sorry that I bought this, sight unseen. It is very boring, very contrived, and very uninteresting. The beautiful story of Our Lady of Guadalupe is totally lost in the poorly developed modern day saga. Don't waste your money or time."
5,Perfect.,Very beautifull movie. Everyody should see to understand a part of the mystery of Christian Faith.
5,VIVID DETAILS,"Loved this book, could not put it down, felt like I was there. I want to keep reading ."
3,Great scent but,"It doesn't last. You spray it on and it smells great,10 minutes later,it's as if you never put it on."
4,Trout Stream Insects,"Good stuff to have in your vest as you walk along the stream, wondering what the trout are eating that day."
3,:):,umm this product was great the shipping was fast i messed up because i was looking for the original cards but i didnt read the description but that was my fault i will differently return to look in the store for older products
4,An enjoyable film!,"In the reduced list of the most relevant films of U.K. made in the late forties, this is one of the top ones. A meek detective story writer and a group of kids crack a gang of thieves. This was the same team who eventually made ""The lavender hill mob."""
5,WRITING ON WRITING,"THOUGHTS:At last! A sensible rational book on the graffiti sub-culture. This book presents established sociological schools of thought uniquely re-interpreted in a reader-friendly down to earth methodology. Should be compulsary reading for any student of Culture or Sociology, or indeed anyone with an interest in this controversial artform.I think it would be enlightening reading for those who continue to make political mileage about the deviance of graffiti , and force them to examine the roots and different branches of the sub-culture. I only wish I'd owned it at the beginning of my degree course but will be fully utilising it in my last year of essays. It is rare to read a book which balances academic strength with such clarity on the little studied role of female participants of sub-cultures."
2,Not the best Monin product,"Monin usually makes some great products. This is not one of them. My first experience with Monin was a bottle of their apricot syrup which I picked up at a gourmet market in NYC. It was bright, sweet and tasted like it was made from natural ingredients. I can't compare it to fresh apricot juice, but it made a nice soda.Their blood orange syrup does not meet the high bar they've set for other products. It tastes 100% artificial -- like it belongs in a Slurpee machine. It's tart, no doubt from the addition of copious amounts of citric acid. It has a very unnatural, neon orange color. I thought I might be able to use this to add a sour kick to some cocktails, but the dye here makes them look like something poured directly from a Mad Dog 20/20 bottle. Yikes.If you're someone who likes Kool Aid and Tang, you'll probably enjoy this. If you're more of an Orangina drinker, you may be able to tolerate this. If you prefer fresh orange juice, stay away."
2,Not the best Sweet Valley Twins book in the series,"This isn't one of the best Sweet Valley Twins books. After the first time I read this, I thought, ""Huh? What just happened?"" It just didn't make too much sense. I also don't understand why Jessica hid the money in the tennis racket. If she was just hiding it for one night, why couldn't she hide it in her desk or her drawer? I always thought it was a little more than a coincidence that the tennis racket, which had been there for weeks, just happened to be used that very morning. I like the Sweet Valley Twins books very much, but I do not recommend this one."
2,"Be warned, F-D is way over the hill","I don't think it is even worth it to coment on the musical contents here given that the main attraction, Fischer-Dieskau, is singing way past his prime. If you want to hear Mahler sung with a very dry baritone that has lost all its lyricism, here you go."
3,Spongebob Doll ok.,"My son loves Spongebob but he does not play with this that much. It stays on his bed. It is ok. Certainly better than the ""Rip pants"" doll. This one does not teach things that are inappropriate. Over all it is not a MUST have toy."
2,Not for me,"I read this book because of a positive review I saw for it under Ender's Game. But if you liked Ender's Game, you probably shouldn't read this one. It's nothing like it. The characters are suppose to be able to ""sing emotion"" which was completely beyond me. I didn't get it, I didn't enjoy it. But who knows, maybe others will."
2,Songmaster,The book is well written with all the usual plots and deep-character development characteristic of OSC.It also contains quite a handful of homosexual situations including an intercourse between two males.Personally it was a bit too graphic for me. And I believe it would be too much for younger audience that are usually finding themselves in OSC's books.
3,"entertaining story, difficult characters","The way people relate to each other in this book seems.. I don't know.. if not naive, then at least archaic. I couldn't really relate to any of the characters, or get into the story too much because they didn't seem like real people to me. Still, it entertained me enough."
5,More emotionally involving that Ender's Game,"I first read this book because I had read Ender's Game, and I was interested in other OSC books; by the time I had finished it, I came to care about Annsett as much as Ender. This is a book of raw emotional power, and succeeds in presenting a complete lifetime of struggle and triumph, without ever distracting from the SF/fantasy storyline"
4,Excellent story,"I would highly reccomend this novel to any fan of OSC. In his typically excellent style Card tells a fascinating, if somewhat sentimental, sci-fi story. I found it to be an altogether interesting story with some unexpected plot twists."
5,A landmark accomplishment for OSCard,"It has been several years since I have read this particular book, however its power and poignancy still stays with me. Ansset's journey from the innocence of a child through his trials and tribulations as an adult through his final days at the school are brought forth in such a way as to make him a part of who you are. A tragedy of epic proportions, yet with successes to finally, when all is said and done, leave you with happiness in your heart that you read the book and shared such a story, yet saddened to have finished it. Anyone who finishes this book without being affected in a fairly profound manner has no poetry.. no music in their soul."
4,Somewhat thin but enjoyable read,"In this book, Card keeps his theme of emotionally/physically abused genius kids who change the world. The main story is quite good, but the subplots (love affairs of various sorts, mainly) are not sufficiently interesting or integrated to the rest of the story. Card's exploration of free will and emotional and physical manipulation is illuminating, as always. Overall, a very good read, but up to the level of, say, ""Xenocide."""
2,A Disappointment,"I have loved many of Orson Scott Card's books, but I couldn't even finish this one. I was very disappointed, and I'm very surprised by the positive reviews I've read. Read the Ender's Game series or the Homecoming Saga if you are looking for a good book."
1,"If you love books about pedophilia and homosexual intercouse, you'll love this book.","This book has a recurring theme of pedophilia and homosexuality, which really turned me off. Without that I'd have given this book 5 stars. Orson Scott Card is a great author. It's sad that he chose to cheapen this book with such unnecessary content."
5,Stunning,"I had never read any Orson Scott Card before Songmaster, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Fortunatly, I wasn't the least bit disapointed.The characters in this story are delightful, completely unpredictable, and actually *interesting* (I find that so few Fantasy characters posess that certain trait!) My favorite was, perhaps Kyaren, because her purpose was a mystery until the plot unraveled.The writing style was fabulous as well. The novel was supposed to be about music, but ended up being just as lyrical by itself.The only fault I can think of, is that the ending seemed to change pace abruptly. I would have liked to see it expanded further, but perhaps, I would have enjoyed it less then. It's difficult to tell."
4,Tides and Seasons,"A beautiful collection of Celtic poems and prayers. They are written in everyday language, accessible, and relevant to our times. The prayers evoke a connection with the Divine Spirit irrespective of religious affiliation. I especially enjoyed selecting a particular one and meditating on it. Very rich!"
3,Intrigued but not excited,"I found the CD very interesting but would only recommend it to hard core fans of the Isley Brothers, who are interested in hearing their early unpolished work. 'The Early Years' shows flashes of their greatness, but it is not a great CD."
4,It arrived on time and my mom loved it,The product arrived on time and my mother loved it. It was hard getting a person that would ship to Puerto Rico but gratefully this product was able to be shipped.
1,not original,"This is one of my favorite Fragrance ever, been using it for years now.This is the first time i'm buying it online, and it was a bad idea. I thought buying it directly through and from Amazon, will be save me from getting a fake one, but the parfume i received was definitely not the Original. Smells like it for the few seconds and not even as strong as the original, and it reaaaaaaally lasts for minutes not hours. Too bad...Gotta go a grab the real one from Macys, exepensive but at least i know what i am getting."
1,no scent whatsoever,"I have ordered this product many times from Amazon, but this was the first from this seller (Amazon). It arrived looking perfect and wrapped. But once I sprayed it, it did not smell like Burberry or anything at all. It was a total fake and waste of money. I do not recommend purchasing this perfume from them at all."
1,Burberry does not authorize to sell on amazon,"This has been my signature scent for years, its what my family and friends know me for. I purchased it off amazon, with amazon as the supplier. The scent was weak. I emailed Burberry asking if they changed the formula and they asked me to send the bottle to them to test it. Needless to say, it's not the authorized version. It was a copy. They said they will NEVER sell Burberry fragrances on amazon, and the dealers have an agreement not to sell to unauthorized retailers that's pretty strictly enforced. So buyer beware. This is not an authentic product, and you can not return it because its considered a hazardous material. Do yourself a favor and purchase it at a department store and keep these unauthorized suppliers from profiting by selling fake perfumes."
1,FAKE,"This wasn't perfume... had faint smell of Burberry that immediately disappeared once applied. I've worn this perfume, purchased elsewhere, for years and have never had such a problem. I noticed immediately the color was off and was very disappointed in the lack of fragrance. Amazon was awesome and refunded me for the trouble. 5 stars for you, Amazon support team!"
5,Great perfume!,"I absolutely love this fragrance; I've had trouble finding scents that work with my body chemistry, and this one is a dream come true! It's on the spicy side and quite soft. Super price through Amazon, too!"
5,An amazing fragrance,"Timeless, the only perfume thats a must-have for me, that i replace every time it runs out. Most other burberry fragrances are great as well. But, of course, youll want to try it on your own skin at a dept store or something beforehand. But def buy it here; its much cheaper."
3,Light fragrance,My fiance does not like it as the fragrance does not last for more than 2 hours....smells good for the first 1 hour..
1,bad burberry,this perfume is soooooo awful its not longlasting i spray myself like 50 times before going out the door i cant wait for it to be finished
1,Heavy and sweet,This is too sweet smelling and kind of loud. I purchased this because at the time it was the fav. of a celebrity whom I liked. I guess everyone has different tastes. Will not purchase again or recommend.
2,Not pleased,"I looove the scent and my old Burberry Classic would stay on for hours like an EDP should. This particular one fades like a body splash, making me doubt its authenticity or freshness. I'm not sure what it depends on but now I'm stuck with a 3.3 oz bottle that I can't even wear because the smell is gone by the time I step outside."
1,Do Not Buy!!!,"I have been wearing this scent for many years, and this is not it. At first it smells terrible, then it dries down to no scent at all. Guess I have to repurchase from Nordstroms or Sephora, where I will get the real thing. Very disappointed; I thought I was safe buying directly from Amazon, I was wrong."
1,this is garbage,The bottle of Burberry I received from Amazon.com was so weak it didn't last 5 minutes on the skin. Save yourself the drama and buy it from a department store. What a terrible disappointment in quality control.
5,Love the scent,Love the scent- I've used this and their weekend scent for years. I always gets compliments when I wear it!
1,watered down,perfume seems watered down scent is very faint not happy with this productI did get it on time and packaging was perfect.
3,"Smells ok, maybe a little old for your taste, not returnable","First of, you'd better be sure you want it, cuz perfume & cologne are not return-able on amazon.I wanted to buy this for my girlfriend as a little gift for Mothers' Day, but it took a long time to be shipped, and I didn't get it until near end of May. By that time it was too late and I've already had to buy something else for her on Mothers' Day. The thing that pissed me off was I didn't know the thing could not be returned as there was no warning from amazon, so I for sure won't ever buy perfume from amazon again.When my girlfriend opened it, she wasn't so thrilled about the smell, as it was a little too old for her (she prefers fresh-smelling perfume) unlike what people reviewed about this product. I guess it will be sitting unused on the shelf for a long time."
1,VERY weak barely any fragrance,I've worn this fragrance for yrs & I've never experienced any with such little fragrance. Almost like it was watered down.
1,Fake product,"What I received was not real perfume. It does smell like vodka with a hint of fragrance, and in 5 minutes the smell is gone."
1,So bad.,"If I could give this 0 stars, I would. In short: it's water. Buy this perfume in person from a department store so you can actually smell it with your own nose before owning it and then finding out you can't return it to Amazon. This stuff ordinarily smells fantastic... what a disappointment."
5,Everything I expected,The order was exactly as expected. Unopened package. The scent is exactly the same as the store baught version. Love it!
4,Good,"Burberry By Burberry For Women, Eau De Parfum Spray 3.3-OuncesBurberry.Burberry By Burberry For Women, Eau De Parfum Spray 3.3-OuncesBurberry"
5,"OMG, couldn't beat the price",I bought this as a present for a gift exchange. The person picked this thinking knowing no one would get it since our spending cap was only at 25.00. She put it so her hubby would know to get it for her. I was able to get it at a steal. Best purchase ever. Came quickly too and in good packaging.
1,Ignorance & Prejudice,"This anti-Catholic screed is based on raw ignorance. The Catholic Church permits many other kinds of natural family planning than the rhythm method. The Pontifical Biblical commission never voted in favor of women's ordination. The anecdotal ""incidents"" cited by Manning are suspect. The alleged speakers (no documentation provided) all speak in Manning's distinctive voice.Please be forewarned: Joanna Manning is an ex-Catholic who is a member of Catholics for a Free Choice and other anti-Catholic orgranizations."
1,Deceit,"This is a strange book. This author claims that under John Paul II the Catholic church has deserted its traditional moral teaching. She claims that church once ordained women, once supported abortion, once said that sex outside marriage was ok. And she clearly hopes that some future pope will bring us back to this golden libertarian age.This is pure nonsense, of course: historical nonsense and doctrinal nonsense. One only wonders whether igonorance or malice has the upper hand in this angry anti-Catholic tract."
1,Just who is Catholic here?,"This work is a raw expression of hate: toward the Church, toward the gospel, toward John Paul II, toward natural law. The author uncritically takes the entire agenda of NOW (right down to abortion) and then rants that the Catholic Church is, well, Catholic."
1,Rage Theology,"Well, this is certainly an angry book.Ms. Manning is convinced that Pope John Paul II is a heretic. No proof here, of course. Only rage at the fact that this pope courageously defends the right to life and the rights of the family.The little anecodtes are more than doubtful.Anti-Catholic bile from an embittered ex-nun."
4,Accurate assessment of women's role in the Catholic Church,"Although harsh in content, I found what Joanna Manning had to say reflected my experiences within the Church. I have hope like the author, that in time the church will move forward in the direction that all of humanity will be accepted as one in Christ. Unfortunately, we are not there as of yet, and many women are still being harmed by some of the misogyny remaining in our church. More women need to speak up as Joanna Manning has done. I find her incredibly courageous in her outspoken manner. I loaned this book to a friend, and she could not put the book down."
1,Is Manning Catholic?,"The book offers up an unoriginal feminist critique of what the Catholic Church teaches. It is predictable from the first to last page.The oddest thing about the book is that the author claims that John Paul II doesn't understand Catholic teaching. She doesn't appear to realize that the teachings of John Paul II simply update the Church's longstanding (and unchangeable) position on ordination, contraception, and abortion. She seems to think that these positions are just this Pope's mysterious pet theory and that a puff of white smoke can change anything.One can only contrast the balanced, hopeful tone of John Paul II's Letter to Women with the bitter, angry tone of this entire book.Sad."
1,Confronting Anti-Catholicism,"Here we have yet another book from someone who claims to love the Church but whose hatred for what the Church teaches is unbounded.The author criticizes the Church on a predictable set of leftwing issues; abortion, birth control, ministry. But she clearly doesn't understand the reasons behind the teachings. She seems shocked that the Church isn't a local chapter of NOW. No sense of Scripture, tradition, liturgy, natural law as the rule of faith. The abusive treatment of John Paul II is disturbing.The book is painful to read because it is clear that it's the author's own self-hatred, not Catholic teaching, that fuels the bitter rhetoric."
1,Hell hath no fury,"After reading this anti-Catholic book, one must wonder if Ms. Manning dons a white hood and burns crosses on the weekend.The author offers a liberal-left cariciature of the Church's teaching on sexuality and procreation. She screams that it oppresses women, but she offers no indictment of how modern American culture oppresses women. Where is the indictiment of the abotion industry? Of the pronographer? Of woman-impoverishing divorce? Of the pharmaceutical giants plying impoverished women with demeaning devices men would never accept?Save your money and read some Mary Anne Glendon instead."
5,Beautiful & sad (sois belle et sois triste),"The movie adaptation of the novel is very well done - perhaps a bit glossy for such a sad tale, but what do you expect from a Bollywood production. The music, however, is superb. If you liked the movie you'll love this cd which evokes all the melancholy and joyful beauty contained within the tale of a woman's slow fall from love and grace. Or perhaps it is true that the grace prevails, even if the love does not.There are no bad tracks on this cd and we find ourselves listening to it over and over again. If you are a fan of Indian/Pakistani music in general (sitars soothing) then this collection of songs will satisfy."
4,Good breakfast recipes,This book is ok for diabetics. For me the breakfast recipes are better than the others. Overall it is well worth the price.
5,"Best Of Robert ""Soup"" Campbell-Memories-Part Two by Robert ""Soup"" Campbell","Hi,Before I order this album, I like to know if this not a CD-R formaat.I don't like those sample.Let me first know before I order.Thanks,R. Boston."
5,Great books,"This is just what my son wanted. He is just starting to read and loves ""spooky"" stuff. Watches the shows as well. This is what got him interested in the books."
3,An early draft of `Being and Time'.,"Perhaps, one of the first and least interesting of Heidegger's long phenomenology books from the 1920s. Most of what is contained within this text is worked out brilliantly in his masterwork `Being and Time, e.g., the ontological/ontic structures of temporality. Ironically, there is little exposition of `history' or the history of the `concept of time' in this work. I read this work during my thesis on Heidegger's thinking on spatiality. It contains some insights regarding this aspect of Heidegger's thought, but does not add much to `Being and Time.' I recommend this to serious and budding Heidegger scholars, but others with only a passing interest I would recommend `Being and Time' and `The Basic Problems Of Phenomenology' as much better choices."
5,"Pragmatic, focused, detailed","This book is a deep in-depth view of the function of Peoplesoft on an Oracle database. Not only does it cover the fundamentals of how Peoplesoft uses the database features, it also details almost every table in the system on a row by row basis. An in-depth resource which is sure to be invaluable to anyone using this software configuration."
1,oracle dba,"Sounds like this author is very confused personality.Being myself, 13 years in Oracle DBA field,This book is so badly written, everywhere there is a confusion.Definitely not recommend reading. But unfortunately there is NO other Peoplesoft book for oracle DBA.At least it will give some idea how peoplesoft Tools especially designer works."
1,Led Flashing Bone,This product is worthless. I purchased it because I wanted a safety light for my pet that I could turn off and on. The off and on switch does not work and the light turns on by itself. I have used two different units and they both had the same problem. I would recommend that no one buy this product.
1,product did not work.,Fist product arrived and bateries did not work. Second one arrived and betteries did not work. I am going to return it this time for a refund.
4,ms.,First one I received didn't work. They sent me another no questions asked.Happy with product and service.
1,A bad lamp for xmas,"My Dad got me this lamp for xmas. I put in my room, and one light doesn't work at all. It smells like plastic with the right bulbs. Dad said it is going back to Target. I wish I had picked another lamp for my wish list for xmas. This might start a fire."
1,Very hot,"I am actually returning this lamp. I just bought it only a week ago and it's only used a few hours a day. Not only did I notice one of the lights was already not working, when I went to switch it off I burnt my arm on the lower lamp. It gets very hot fast and there's nothing to protect you from burning yourself or your house down!"
1,Very Scary....,"I bought this lamp at the store for $12.99. As I put it together, I thought I had got a great bargain. I screwed in the light bulbs and turned it on, and I noticed this lamp put out about the same amount of light as the little banker's lamp I have on my desk. I thought I could get more light from the lamp if I tried a stronger wattage, but as I unscrewed a bulb (after only two minutes of being on) to put in another, it broke in the lamp! It went back in the box that night, broken light bulb bits and all."
2,There are many better lamps. But this one will do.,"The baffles (black plastic things on the lampshades) make the lamp less glaring-in-your-eyes if it's pointed kind of at you, but do yourself a favor and pop them all out before even turning it on. Otherwise, a nasty burnt plastic smell will fill your room as the baffles slowly melt and char. I did use 75-watt bulbs instead of the rated 60-watt max, but I can't see how 15 watts made the difference.If you remove the baffles, you won't have any smell.Apart from the baffle problem, it works pretty well and assembly was not a problem."
2,yahoo!!.. yuck,i really liked the look of this lamp and then i took it home and i was puttin it together with my mom and the poles were crooked and didnt fit in right. talk about bad manufacturing.
1,IT BROKE,I could have built a better lamp. What attracted me to it was the fact that it was a good height. But it is not one continuious pole and base instead it is put together in 3 parts and the middle part BROKE. so basically it is unusable.
2,poorly manufactured,"A cheap fix, but poorly made. Be prepared to receive what you paid for. Do not expect it to last long. All three lights broke/snapped off the pole within two years, upon adjusting them. But as I said, I good cheap fix."
2,OK,This lamp did smell like burning plastic all the time even with the proper light bulb watt. The lamp only lasted approx. 6 mths. (occassional use) before constantly burning out all of the lightbulbs instantly. Not a terrific buy for the money.
1,Is something burning?,"This lamp has stunk (stank?) from day one-it always smells like melted plastic, even though I replaced the normal bulbs with a lower wattage than the directions called for."
5,A most wonderful read!,"Reading Saraceno was a little like joining the author in a trip through the eye of a tornado. Issues, consequences and events whirled around the characters and carried me along in the storm. I loved it! The story is compelling, thoughtful, unusual and the prose is delicious. Marbrook's handling of language is that of a skilled sailor working the lines on his boat and bringing it to harbor safely.I've re-read the book twice and like it better each time."
1,Don't buy bad workplace advice!,"I used the advice in this book to deal with a bad boss and the toxic work environment that was created. In compliance with Amazon's review policy I won't reveal it here. In my case the end result is hostility, harassment, and retaliation. What Scott apparently forgets is that these ""bad bosses"" will regard ANY challenge (even those advocated in her book) as a personal threat and will use the assets at his disposal (i.e., company assets, discipline process) for retribution AGAINST the assertive employee. And since he IS the boss, he has the full backing of the company, regardless of legality, ethics, or motives. These tactics may work with rational, well adjusted supervisors in employee-focused companies, but in my experience pathological bosses are the rule and not the exception.Do yourself a favor. If you have a bad boss, find a better job and DON'T buy this book or use the advice contained therein."
5,Very Informative Book on How to Deal with a Bad Boss,"I found this book very helpful in suggesting strategies for dealing with a couple of bad bosses in my workplace. I applied the approach of talking things over with one and suggested ways we could improve the relationships and I could work more effectively, and it worked. In the other case, I suggested some changes in a memo, since my boss didn't like talking about things. And a friend of mine realized that it was better not to do anything at all, since her boss didn't like anyone to stand up to him so she didn't do that. The book helped me realize that one has to use different approaches with different kinds of bosses, and I enjoyed reading all the stories of different situations employees faced. A great book. I really liked it."
1,Dated,"Is this book really published in 2005? Because some sections seem really dated, especially those related to specific violations such as drug use or harassment. I can understand that the remedies for dealing with office bullies and psychopaths aren't always clear cut, but she could have and should have included specific legal advice when dealing with harassers or drug addicts. Based on some of the recent training I received , her advice in parts IV ('Out of Bounds') and V ('Ethical Challenges') seem dated or, even worse, wrong."
2,Disappointing,"Our family loves the Belly Button Song from the Sing Along with Putumayo CD, so we had high hopes for this disc. Unfortunately, the songs are plagued by a sameness that makes this hard to listen to. Grumpy is great, but the others tend to run together."
3,A couple GREAT songs,"I really loved the 'Grumpy' song when I heard it on TV, so I bought this CD as a gift for my nieces and nephews. I have gotten to listen to it and honestly I was expecting every song to be at the 'Grumpy' quality and sadly they aren't. There are probably 4 or 5 songs I would listen to over and over. The others are a little too grown up and they don't seem appealing to kids. I can't get enough of GRUMPY though. :)"
5,Can it be true?,"How many CDs by the same artist can be this good?I don't know but ""Grumpy"" is another. Diverse in musical style, witty, funny, poignant and true."
5,Got a fish and learned how to fish,"Before I buy a program book, I always to read the book to see if it meets my two basic requirements: one is writing style. It should be written in clear and plain English and well organized. The another is more, clear explanation of ""How it works"", not only just put all the codes and without or with only little bit explanation. Cristian Darie's books always are one of my top choices. I recommend that you read CHAPTER 8, The Shopping Basket and CHAPTER 11, Customer Details. It lists all methods, dig more detail and offer ""Do it yourself"". Finally, you Got a Fish and Learned How to Fish!!!"
4,LOVE IT!,"The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because one part was broken (which the seller described when I purchased it). Other than that, this is the best computer ever. And when I took it to school with me, others (who had purchased more expensive laptops) were going ga-ga over it.You can write on the outside of the cover when it is closed. You use a stylus pen which pops out of its own little compartment when you gently press down on it. You can detach the keyboard completely if you don't want to use it. There are so many different features that it is just amazing. Sometimes when I take it to class, I will go to the ""One Note"" program and click ""record"" and let it record the teacher speaking. I can even write notes on it. Both the voice and the written notes are typed right into a Word document for me.If you can still find one of these, I would definitely recommend buying it because it is so worth the money. I only paid $220.00 on amazon.com which was a steal deal."
5,Cousteau/Moreau,"The album is great, my main review is on the UK Amazon site. I'm writing here to try and get the download name of the group amended to their correct name.Cousteau are known as Moreau in the US, not at all sure where Amazon have got the name Carlos Moreau from.The good news for Cousteau fans is that Liam McKahey is about to launch a solo album in the UK, there is no release date yet but the wait is almost over."
1,Disappointing,"I can't add much to Mr. Ulrich's very on-target remarks besides my agreement. He has already mentioned the two most irksome things about the book, namely the lack of tone indicators, and the lack of correspondance between the Cantonese and the Mandarin text. Let me clarify this for those who haven't looked at the book. Each sentence is presented in both romanization and in Chinese characters. The trouble is that while the romanization is faithful to the language spoken on the tape, the Chinese characters seem to have been borrowed wholesale from (I'm guessing) the Mandarin version of their phrasebook, leaving only the loosest of semantic ties between the two. There is thus no question of using the characters to find out exactly what you are saying. It's as if the authors were actively hostile to the ambitious student."
4,"Pulls you in, hard to put down.",I feel the author did a very good job on developing a complex and interesting society. The way the characters interacted made me feel involved. I have been waitng and waiting for a sequel!
2,not for use with puck,"This goal is light and folds for easy storage, but the tubing is beginning to shatter after 3 shooting practice sessions with a puck. I do not think this goal was made for use with a puck. A ball would probably be alright.Also, the instructions do not include a picture of what the goal should look like after assembly. Print out the image from the web, you'll need it during assembly."
3,Nice net but a pain to put together,"I got this for my kids who are just getting into soccer and hockey so I was looking for a good net for a couple of sports. This is a great product for that. It is well priced, however, it is a nightmare to put together. The pieces are not marked and the directions are not very good. I do like the product, but if you buy it have some patience and time set aside to put it together."
3,More of a history book than a cookbook,"I bought this book because I was attracted to the many reviews and descriptions extolling the wonderful food and great retelling of the restaurant's illustrious history. The authors have done an excellent job of detailing the restaurant's founder and the institution's beginnings.However, I was most disappointed that more space was given to the history and not to the recipes. It was also indicated that the recipes are not the originals, but are re-creations of the originals.In fairness, the recipes are enticing and include some of the most tempting seafood recipes I have come across in one book.However, to get the most out of this book, I recommend that you should at least have been to Lundy's (or at least be familiar with the Sheepshead Bay area); and have plenty of fresh seafood (lobster, crab, and oysters) at your disposal in order to try the recipes. Without those, this book may be a disappointment, like it was for me."
4,Memorabilia,"This is a beautiful book that I purchased for my boss who has a tie to the Lundy family. My only disappointment was that I was sure I was purchasing it new and it came used with inscriptions and all. Book has lots of background and history. Would have liked it new...I certainly paid the ""new"" price."
4,Going back in time,"My Mother n Father went to this Reataurnt..They took me as a childMy husband n I took my son as a child,andhe loved it..I bought this book for him..He lovesthe shrimp cocktails they served..so the recipesare for him..Thanks Amazon for having this book.."
4,A great gift for my parents--NYC in the 40's,I enjoyed it but I wish it included an address of the restaurant and phone number so I could send my folks a gift certificate for an evening of nostalgia. Anyone know it?
5,I watched it warily...,"I started watching this film with a whole lot of doubt and skepticism. I am by no means radical in any way, and until recently was also anti-legalization. John Holowach is a new filmmaker with a lot to say, and he does it without condescension, and with plenty of wry humor and wit. Some parts of the film pissed me off, and others made me very sad. It wasn't a boring, typical documentary by any means, and I highly recommend you check it out, if only because it's the first serious look at the War on Drugs that doesn't cop out to either extreme of the argument."
4,"Solid Film, but room for improvement","Has a lot of good facts and information but the arrangement does seem a bit biased towards pro-cannabis. I would of liked to see more anti-cannabis quotes, videos, etc. to help balance and show the outrageous ""factor"" of why cannabis is illegal. Overall it was a good film but seemed a little bit dated to me and I prefer the newer ""The Union"" documentary. The film comes off as a student's argument for the consequences of a current U.S. policy. I would of liked to see the inclusion of medical/scientific studies surrounding Cannabis."
3,"High: The True Tale of American Marijuana by Keith Stroup, John Holowach","High: The True Tale of American Marijuana by Keith Stroup, John Holowach. This is a good video on the Subject. Biased, but almost everyone talking about this subject has some biases. Some good information on the Drug use and trade in America."
3,Too many coinciidences...,"This book is beautifully written, but I don't do well with magical realism and a lot of it IS magical realism. The elegance of the writing partially makes up for the weaknesses of the plot, but overall I came away dissatisfied. This is one of those books where the parts are greater than the whole. Individual sections are enchanting, but..."
3,In the Image: A Novel,"We read this book for our ""Jewish"" book club. And while we all found it interesting, we also found it to be a little too neat and quite frankly bizarre at the end. We all learned something about ourselves and loved the stories of the old country the most. It was worth the read, but defintely not a page turner!"
4,Wondrous First Novel!,"This is a beautiful book, and nearly impossible to explain. The book is about the life of a young suburban girl in America. The book is about the life of an elderly man whose family has gone through persecution in Europe and struggle in America. But most importantly, the book is about the way lives intertwine and overlap, sometimes without our even realizing it. I suppose that description sounds like it could apply to other books. But this book is truly special, culminating in a terrific ending. I would especially recommend it to anyone who loves rereading books and finding new things each time or is interested in a book which is a loving rendering of stories of immigrants.The main reason I am not going to give it five stars is because I believe even better things lie ahead in the future for this very young and very talented author."
4,Captivating!,"My husband and I shared our copy, and took turns reading this book. We had trouble deciding who was going to get to read it, because we both found it compelling. But it's more than a page-turner. Each chapter is rich with history and the kind of facts and details that makes you feel as if you're living the drama, not just reading about it. The ties between the characters are fascinating, and reveals how each of our lives has the potential to impact another. As a Jew, this book made me think about the value of ritual practice (or not), and how I define myself in terms of my culture and religion. My husband and I used the book as the basis for some wonderful discussions, and I recommended it to the book group at my synagogue. A winner!"
5,A Salute to the Salute,"Salute To Disney Arthur Feidler and the Boston Pops is a wonderful CD that features Disney classic songs in orchestral form. The arrangements are true to the originals and the song choice is heavy on the classic compositions of the Sherman brothers. Do not expect to find more recent material, as this recording was created over two decades ago. Still, it is thoroughly enjoyable to this Disney fan!"
3,Disappointingly thin volume,"This is more of a booklet than a book. It contains only eight models: two birds, a fish, two stars, a tetrahedron, a hat, and a robot. The birds are the basic crane and a basic swan. So that should give you an idea of the difficulty level.I probably wouldn't have bothered to buy this book if I had seen how few patterns it contains. But it's not a bad book. The instructions are clear and well illustrated. If you are just starting out with Origami and only want a few simple patterns this is not a bad place to start."
5,Read it NOW...Don't wait for a funeral to hear this message.,"The Christian life is filled with lessons, and H.B. Kelchner describes two of the least discussed topics of the Bible: the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment. You'll hardly hear any sermons on these topics anymore unless you hear them preached at a funeral.The topic of JUDGMENT is less than desirable for seeker-friendly services and yet the Bible is full of examples where even the apostles declared that we will ALL stand before the Judgment Seat of Christ...read the book and let it change your persective on this present life: it truly is as Kelchner describes a ""Better place than Heaven."""
1,You Get What you pay for,I saw the reviews for this product and figured I would buy it based on the good reviews. Needless to say it turned out to be a sixty dollar steam vac.The nozzles do not spray liquid most of the time and after only the second use the suction did not work. Do yourself a favor and spend the money to get a decent machine instead of a toy.
5,perfect for small home,"this unit is the perfect size for a small home. I have purchased 2 of them. One for my home and one for my son and it is the perfect size for our singlewide manufactured homes. I had tried a larger unit in my home and it seems I spent as much time tripping over it as I did using it. Easy to use, easy to clean amd does as good of a job as the larger rental unit I had used before."
1,Front sucker constantly getting clogged.,"OK, I'm not sure why previous review love this thing, unless they were cleaning clean carpets. My issue was in order to get a strong vacuum, the front sucker is very narrow. This unit tends to create wads of wet dust bunnies, which when they go through the narrow vent, get clogged. You have to use a knife to clean out the narrow vent in order for it to get it's vacuum back. And yes, I did vacuum before. But, maybe the pre vacuuming is the problem. The carpet I was cleaning was also semi thick."
4,"OK, For A Deep Cleaner With No Brush",I have had it aout 3 yars now and it OK. Sometimes I use The RUG DOCTER that do's much better. It has no brush. It do's NOT pick up much dirt. If you whould like a CLEAN carpet get a HOOVER or rent a RUG DOCTOR.
4,Generally pleased,"I used the machine for the first time last night. We have hardwood floors, but there is a white 5 x 7 area rug in the living room that we really needed to clean. I figured that getting this machine would probably cost no more than a single professional cleaning. The machine did remove an amazing, or maybe the right word is disgusting, amount of dirt from the rug. My only disappointment is that around the border of the rug there is a pattern with raised areas in the shape of leaves. The machine was not able to clean effectively down between those raised areas. I'm not sure what I will do about those spots, but if you are getting it to clean regular carpet then this limitation shouldn't pose a problem for you."
4,Good stuff,"I've had this machine for about 2 years and it serves its purpose. It cleans really well food spills, cat throwup, and other feline disasters. It does not clean makeup spills."
2,Disappointed,"It says ""Steamer"", there is NO steam. Very disappointing. Most of these stand up carpet cleaners that say ""steam"" do not steam. Also, it makes a high pitched noise."
1,"Don't buy this machine, you'll be sorry!!","I bought this machine to clean up after my arthritic incontinent antique dog, I should have my saved money instead. I bought this thing,whatever it is, it isn't a carpet cleaner, in January 2005, since then it has been in the shop twice for leaks, drips and non spraying. When it hasn't been in the shop it only sort of works, I do better with a wet rag and a wet/dry vac than this piece does on it's best day. If the repairman ever gets this thing to work again I think I'll donate it to a thrift store, if they'll take it that is!"
1,Don't waste your money,When I initially bought it worked great. Then after about three uses the brushes stopped scrubbing and none of the cleaning solution would come out. So I would have to our the cleaning solution and then scrub it myself and then the only thing the Bissell was good for was sucking the water and soap out of the rug and THAT'S IT!
1,There's water in my carpet!,"I was thrilled with the light weight of the cleaner, but quickly dismayed at the results. The tank emptied and the results in the retrieving tank was about 1/10 of what I had put onto the carpet. We are in day 3 of wet carpets. I have returned the machine and am hoping to find something else that picks up the water. I was also hoping the brushes would work for stains - but because of the weight of the machine, I think the top fibers are all that are getting ""combed"" by the brush. Don't waste your money, and if you do make sure it's returnable."
4,Lightweight Cleaner,"I got this machine because my son is just about allergic to everything and I didn't want to rent and/or lug out a monster machine. This Bissell does everything as advertised, is lightweight and compact enough to store in the closet easily. If you're looking for something that really deep cleans, this isn't it, but for a periodic once-over, it's fantastic!A statisfied customer"
1,Only One Song worth it,"I was VERY disapointed in this CD. I wish Shenna could take an artist like Jo Stafford and remake her. That would be something. Still her version of ""Someone to Watch Over Me."" is worth the price of the CD alone. The ONLY good track. Look for the Japanese import that has it called ""Greatest Hits."""
2,"In her hit/miss career, this one misses","Really just kind of boring stuff. Eternity is interesting, but not thrilling. The songs from About Last Night are so-so....You'll listen to this one once and then it'll collect dust on your cd rack."
3,Excellent effort by great vocalist,"Sheena Easton, always the victim of over-or-underproduced albums, finds the golden rule in this one. Unfortunately it was not released worldwide in 1987 (when it was recorded). Since it is rare for Sheena to achive this good a result (other similarly good efforts include No Strings and The Lover In Me), give it a try. When she has good producers and songwriters, she truly shines. Mariah and Celine should take notes."
5,Something Amazing!,"When you think of all the ""stars"" of Parker's age who are just marking time, or whose careers have gone down the drain ... and all the angry young men, now turned old conservatives, who can't find anything to kick against ... it's just amazing to put on this CD and hear someone who is still plugged in, still writes great songs, and can sing just like he used to. Of course, this release will count for nothing in today's world of plastic, processed music, but one can only hope enough people will hear it and buy it to keep GP going. This is probably one of the best records of his career. Just listen to ""Jacksonville"" to be completely convinced."
4,"Wow, etc.","My wife (who is not a big music fan) came into the room while I was playing this CD and asked ""Is this Bob Dylan?"" I smiled as GP sang ""Her cheap chipped black nails / pick the threads out of a suture / that was holding your life fast"", and said ""No, but Dylan probably wishes it was."""
2,Too Poorly Written,"To be sure, the aim of this book is interesting, but it's too poorly written. There are so many serious mistakes that I wonder why the students who took the course of these authors didn't point them out.For example, the latter half of Lemma 4.1.5 is wrong for it lacks (-i), and Theorem 7.3.3 is wrong for |K:F| is not equal to the number of automorphisms of K fixing F, but is equal to the number of injective isomorphisms form K to algebraic closure of F fixing F.I recommend you to read more reliable books."
3,Base works perfect,"I wanted something simple for my end tables because I have alot going on with the furniture fabrics. These work great. Metal to match the glass and metal round tables (Pier Uno), but organic too, in the shape. I don't care for the shades though...a bit cheap and light for my decor, so a stop over at LNT fixed that. Over all I am very happy with these. If I happen to run into the table with the vacumn, and they go flying - no problem-o. Sturdy, yet light and airy looking on the tables - great effect because I can't handle the heaviness of many lamps you see in furniture stores....with their huge, bulky end tables to go with them. *ick*"
4,Lovely Lamps,"I ordered two of these and am considering getting the floor lamp that matches.They are pretty, provide a nice amount of light and are simple but pretty.I'm pleased."
4,"for the price and convenience, good lamp","Having spent many hours looking for three-way bulb table lamps that would go into a home living room and or kitchen to provide good reading or ambiant lighting, but not wanting to spend big money through such as Pierre Duex or even Ballard that have my style, and which would fit into eclectic combo of french and american country, with traditional and antique furnishings I was feeling defeated at the price of lamps. When I found these on line I ordered. They just arrived. While a very close look and touch reveals they are not iron-based, from the normal point of view they have a natural almost rustic look that fits my need. I do think the instructions need to be clear that you pull the cord taut from the base when assembling.....it was a bit confusing to this person who is not all that handy....overall pleased."
2,A Disapointment,This lamp proved to be rather disappointing. I ended up not using it where I had originally planned. Although nothing was mentioned in the description I assumed it would take more than a 60 watt bulb but it does not. I would have preferred a 3 way bulb capacity.
4,Pretty and elegant,"The lamp is a little bigger than I thought, and the shade that came with it is a different color than the one that came with the matching floor lamp. Other than that, I am happy with it. It's a pretty, elegant-looking lamp. It's sturdy and doesn't seem like it's going to fall apart any time soon. I'm not blown away, but I am satisfied."
3,Lovely but some problems with assembly,The lamps are lovely and look great in my bedroom. The only problem I had with them is that the screw attaching the lamp shade on one of the two lamps was practically fused so it was incredibly difficult to assemble the lamp. It took me about half an hour and a good pair of pliers to get it off.
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED - NOT HAPPY,THE SOCKET ASSEMBLY & BASE LOOKED BLACK INSTEAD OF BRONZE. THERE WAS A LOT OF CORD BETWEEN THE BASE AND THE SOCKET ASSEMBLY AND IT WOULD NOT GO DOWN INTO THE BASE OR UP INTO THE SOCKET ASSEMBLY. I EXPECTED A LOT BETTER THAN THIS.STYLE # 9300 DPCI# 074-02-0356I BELIEVE THIS LINK IS CORRECTTextured Bronze-Finish Table Lamp
2,Not Fancy Close Up,These lamps looked good on a webb page but are kind of cheap-o looking up close. Once setup they are OK but if paid close attention to they look like shaped pipe than a bronze lamp.Unpacking is a real chore as some 3rd world person really went ape with the tape.The wire has to be pulled through and it's really tough to do without tearing or making bare places in the insulation.
4,come clean,"The shower head is good and what I find best is the flow of water is wide enough to hit the entire back with good pressure to get a relaxing, comfortable, thorough shower without acrobatics"
5,Dang!,"I've had this product for a week now and I am very impressed. It was easy to install and I was happy with the pressure. But then out of curiousity I did the water pressure trick as described by one of the reviewers... and wowzers!!!The pressure is super strong now, almost to the point of too strong. I have a stall shower so the shower head is like 8 inches from my face. Needless to say, it feels like I'm getting blasted by a hose whenever I wash my face. It doesn't really hurt, but for some people it may be too much pressure. And it rinses the shampoo out of my hair in 10 seconds, yes I counted this morning. So yes your shower time will be reduced, but mainly in the hair rinsing part.If you want a high pressured shower, then get this shower head and remove the flow restrictor. It'll have you saying, ""Daaaaannnnnggggg!"" (Or other words that aren't so rated G.)"
2,WARNING!!!!!,This product DOES NOT INCLUDE the arm and flange as shown in the photo.You will ONLY get the shower head. I repeat..................you will ONLY get the shower head.Go Fish for the rest of the product?
5,Made all the difference! Awesome shower head.,My husband and I purchased this shower head for our guest bathroom and I love it so much that I have been using my guest bathroom to shower in now. It is like standing under a waterfall. At the end of a long day I look forward to a nice shower more than ever before. Great product. No complaints.
3,Almost too much pressure,"Funny reading about all the various pressure comments. I was looking for a rain shower feel to replace one that I had previously... same diameter and number of spouts but this one looks great, but is almost too powerful for what I got used to. Because the streams are so narrow when they hit your body it feels more powerful than just rain. I'd get this if you're looking for a showerhead that is very strong to get the shampoo out and has ample pressure. For the feeling of rain I'd settle for something else. Looks great again!"
5,Simple and wonderful,"This is a simple showerhead that works exactly as hoped. It spreads the water out nicely and with rubber ring pulled out of the water flow restrictor it has more pressure than you would ever want. I really like how wide the water stream is, makes showers more enjoyable and actually makes it easier to shower quickly if that's what you're looking for. Best showerhead I've ever used!"
4,Wonderful!,"We live in an area where we need to conserve water, so we added an adjuster to the this and it works beautifully. We have been searching for years, for the perfect shower head and have now found it! -1 star only because it does not come with a water adjuster already attached."
5,great,"I will order some more for my kids baths. Simple assembly, better than expected. Better than most other products. Thanks"
5,Nice Big Shower,"I'm probably using more water, but this thing completely covers shoulder to shoulder, and efficiently rinses shampoo from hair. Love it."
2,Really Poor pressure unless you remove the limiter,"The way this shower head comes (has a limiter in it) has really crappy pressure (so bad you can't get the conditioner out of your hair). If you are not handy with tools, the limiter is very hard to remove. Even after we removed it, I still don't think it's great, just ok b/c the spray is too broad. I would recommend looking for something with better pressure."
2,Pressure not great,"I disagree with the other reviews about the pressure. It is NOT good. I specifically bought this showerhead to replace my other one due to inadequate pressure, and I feel like this one is even worse. The broad stream is nice, but the flow restricter needs to be removed somehow."
3,A little disappointed,"I spent a lot of time researching showerheads before I bought this one. First off, it's not metal, which is what I was specifically looking for. It's plastic! (At least the outer part is.) They should really be more clear about that in the description. I would have returned it but had already purchased a different one that I didn't like that wasn't returnable, and was sick of looking, so I kept it. The pressure is also weaker than I would like - I think I'll try to remove the low-flow regulator as other reviewers here have suggested. Overall it's not terrible, but not great either."
2,Had higher hopes,"Overall, I was disappointed by this book. The reason I bought it was the layout--it seemed clear and concise and a good review to refresh on the Italian I already know. I do find it full of good summary tables, vocabulary lists and verbs. But there are so many typos and errors! Really, there are mistakes in the verb conjugations and in the answers in the appendix. Unforgivable."
1,Some Fun But Many Errors,"Thank goodness I was just reviewing my knowledge of basic Italian! This book contains many interesting sidebars and fun crossword puzzles as well as interesting contemporary social and historical information but there are so many grammar errors (typos and poor, if any, editing) that I must caution any beginner against using it."
2,After 12 month it gone dead,"This battery is not as good as the read CANONafter one year it do not want to work. after full charge and little shot it die out very quickly.The real one is much more reliable than Lenmar I experienced them both, thrust me."
3,Slow,I am an avid Leo Waterman fan. I like his attitude. Having said that I kept wondering what happened in this book. I truly had to persevere to finish it. It was like those repeat trips to the dentist for dental work. Leo was all over the place in this book and characters were odder than normal. Maybe I just didn't get the story of the big steer and a barbecue.
3,Slow Burn,"It was a little slow and confusing in the first two chapters. It was still a good read, but I had already figured out who did the dirty deed. I hate that!! It's the first time with GM Fords Leo Waterman series. Oh well. On to the next book by GM Ford."
4,interresting character and team,Saving a big bull from being the main course at a Bar-B-Que..hilarious.....love the Waterman character...unlike other books I have read recently this guy is humble and interesting...great read.
2,Mystery Stories,"I lfind that this book has too much description and not enough action. I've read other Leo Waterman mysteries that I've liked, but not this one."
5,Enjoyable,G.M. Ford is an excellent writer. I now have read every one of the books and cannot wait for another. His story lines always draw me in.
2,The Author's Worst Book,"Author Ford had me as a devoted fan and I read all of his other books with admiration and envy. But this book just had a lousey, contrived plot and way too much talk with too little action. The book had its amusing moments to be sure, but those are (or should be) sidelights in this genre. The plot and characters have to have some life and meaning; but not in this novel. No one is perfect every time out, though I was beginning to believe that this author was. He convinced me to the contrary. Read all his other books; skip this one."
3,A disappointment!,"I started on this book with a great deal of anticipation. At the end, I was sorely disappointed. Ford seems to have lost the zest and zing that marked the 3 earlier Leo Waterman books - in ""Slow Burn"" I got the impression that he was just going through the motions. The highly improbable conclusion was hurriedly put through in the last few pages - it was though Ford was trying to wrap the book come what may. I hope the next instalment in the Leo Waterman saga will revert to Ford's previously high standards. A little more of the Seattle atmosphere wouldn't come amiss as too would a more detailed explanation of the Waterman-Duvall relationship - now that they have done the deed and moved in together."
2,Too unbelievable for me,"I really enjoyed some of the other Waterman novels, but this one was just too unbelievable. The premise of the book of the rivalry between the two competing steak houses and what they had supposedly done in the past to each other was way beyond any willing suspension of disbelief on my part. This is more a comic novel than a mystery and that is not a genre I care for."
3,A quick read,I was looking for escapism and found it with this book. A private eye with a sense of humor. A mystery that doesn't give everything away.
1,Held my interest. Found the characters intriguing but sometimes got confused about who was who,I enjoyed the book but was having trouble keeping track of all the charactersInteresting turns of the plot. I would recommend this author to others.
4,Swell,"It's the usual collection of Leo and his nearly functional pals, but I like them every time. Ford chugs along nicely with a good sense of place and dialog.0"
3,Not the best Leo Waterman,This is not the best Leo Waterman Mystery and I have read 2 others.There are too many characters and the plot is too complicated.
3,Switch intermittant after two years,"Not enough light. After two years, the switch became intermittant. Sometimes there would be full brightness. Other times I had to bang on it to get full brightness. The best use is close up work. When I put corn out for the deer at five in the morning, it is not realy enough light. I know where my deer stand is. In unfamiliar ground, I would be worried about tripping over vines and roots using this."
5,PETZL TIKKA HEADLAMP,This is a great tool for doing anything in the dark or in low light conditions. I am an electrician and much of what we do is in the dark. The LED light is bright without the glare and the adjustable tilt of the fixture makes it perfect for zeroing in on what you are doing. Battery life is long as well which makes this tool dependable for hours.
4,Great for my night work.,"I told my husband I needed some kind of hands-free light for my work. I have to lock and unlock a building and three padlocked gates after dark. I would have prefered some kind of pendant, but my husband got me this. I have to admit it very adquately allows me to see my keys and the locks and makes my job easier. In the beginning the batteries didn't want to stay in, so that was a problem, the light kept popping apart. For some reason, it's stopped doing that now, so it is no longer a problem. Perhaps the spring that helps hold the batteries in place was too strong in the beginning, but after some use, it relaxed and now works great."
4,Good all round light.,"This light is cheap yet fits all the requirements of a basic headlamp. It's bright, mostly easy to use and adjustable. Two downsides are its switch which is not so easy to use and while the position is adjustable it's not as adjustable as I would like. The position doesn't allow it to shine directly down in front of your feet."
5,A great product.,"i got a similar model for my dad last christmas and he just loves having his hand free when doing hard jobs like fixing the car, and many other uses."
5,Rugged and bright,"I originally bought this for fishing a couple of years ago, but I've used it far more for remodeling and repair jobs. It fits very nicely below a ball cap, the batteries seem to last for at least six hours of use at the max setting, and it has withstood being bounced around in toolbags without damage. With fresh batteries, it provides enough light on the subject to almost eliminate the need for worklights. It is especially handy for PITA jobs like changing out a garbage disposal, where there's barely enough space for you, let alone a hot and clumsy 110V lamp"
2,Jittery light,"This is a much lighter replacement to my previous headlamp, but I am disappointed. The light flickers and changes its brightness constantly. I don't know if it's caused by a loose battery connection, but it is annoying. Also, the switch is more difficult to use than the easy push-button one I had before."
4,"Great headlamp, reasonable price.","Easy to use, great handsfee lighting. My kids and husband love it. From stacking wood at night to reading in the dark. Only downside is that it goes through batteries quickly."
3,Average Product,"This would be an excellent product if it were not for some obviously weak manufacturing. The three leds are very bright...when they're getting juice from the batteries. It seems that the switch easily goes faulty causing intermittent connections. This leads to flickering as well as ""brown outs"" from the lamp.After I've used it for a while I'll probably bust it open to see where the faults are really.But, if you have the patience to fiddle with the switch to get full power to the leds, then go right ahead and get this...otherwise you might raise your blood pressure out of frustration."
2,jiggle jiggle,"I use this to deliver mail in the dark(much more often than I used to).When you get the thing to turn on,it's nice and bright.The problem is that the case keeps popping open,ever-so-slightly. This causes the lights to not turn on or to flicker,so you spend too much time jiggling the darn thing, trying to keep the case closed.If the case were not so prissy,I'd give it 5 stars,but it's a pain to be carrying mail with both hands and having to continually adjust the %$*# case."
1,Item Broke after 2nd time using it.,"I purchased this for my wife who loved it the first time she used it but then the 2nd time around, the cord broke apart from the egg and it is unfixable. And of course the company WILL NOT give a refund or send another one to me.I suggest that NO ONE order anything from this company. They will not treat you with respect even though it's customer's like me that keep them working. So thank's Eskimo Wholesale for NOTHING!!"
1,LOUD!,"This thing is so loud and it doesn't look exactly like the picture. I could have gotten over that, but it's so insanely loud. :\ Very disappointing."
3,"Okay, but soaks up battery","This was a good vibrator for a beginer, but not for m. It doesn't quite achieve what I want. Also, it soaks up a TON of batery juice. I mean, I'm replacing the batteries almost every two weeks, just to make the thing vibrate fast enough to feel good."
2,Not what the picture shows!,"I ordered the item above that is black and purple, and looks like a nice shiny plastic. When I received it (came right on time) it was this ugly clearish gray plastic. Looks and feels cheap. The egg part does have three different speeds, but is a bit bigger then I thought it would be. It is kind of loud if you do not hold the cord correctly, so I would definitely not use anywhere not private. It still does what it says, but it is not the product shown above. Just a similar knock off looking version."
2,Not bad but didn't last long,"I had the product for about a month and loved it. It wasn't used that much and one day, about a month in, I went to get and and it wouldn't turn on. I changed the batteries and it still didn't work. Idk what happened to it, it just died"
3,can be better,This vibrator is ok...I've had better. The intensity levels are not as powerful as other bullets I've come across.
4,Freakn Amazing!,"At first I wasn't going to buy this product because of all the customer reviews, but I figured I couldn't go wrong with my first sex toy. I LOVE IT! Your clitoris becomes stimulated within the first five minutes of use. Yes, it is a cheap little object but it gets the job done. I had almost three orgasms in only fifteen minutes of use. I would recommend this toy to any horny babe out there. It is a great supplement. By the way, please buy batteries before it arrives."
2,Didnt last long,I know vibrators only last so long buT this onE only lasted one use. I tried changing the batteries and everything it wouldn't work. I'm very disappointed. My fist vibrator I ever used was the classic bullet (by back to basics) and it lasted several uses! I decided to buy that one again and would recommend it to others looking for a better vibrator!
3,"Well, Well , Well,",I thought this book was interesting but it was too vague. It includes interesting information on why things are done and the mentality of the computer hacker rather than a how to book. It also includes good information that I never knew.It also includes ideas on how to find out more. I would suggest getting this book if you have enough money and want to have a more broad view of hacking.
4,Pretty good for the price,"The trays are nice. The wood is beautiful and they are semi-sturdy, about what you might expect for $40 trays. I do notice that once the tops get wet, as they do when you have to wipe them off, they discolor a bit - some of the pitting in the wood collects spots. I don't mind it and you would not notice unless it was pointed out to you. Overall, very satisfied."
5,Excellent value,"The TV Tray Set is not only an excellent value, but the tables and racks are very sturdy, made of solid wood. They are attractive enough for use in most, except for the most formal, situations. Of course, if the light-colored wood doesn't work with your decor, then maybe it won't work, but compared to the usual price for this product, it would even be worth staining them to match if you desire. It's hard to imagine they can make this product for the price they sell it for. Definitely a find!!"
3,Folding TV Tray Set,"Materials are good, but tray is a bit small and when set up is a bit high, compared to our old 20 yr. old set."
1,These are pure Chinese junk.,"It's hard to believe the old fashioned plastic TV trays that snapped into aluminum legs are more expensive to produce than these modern God-awful wooden teeter-tottering cheap end-table ""TV trays"", but evidently that is the case because you can't find the old kind any more. These new wooden trays are top heavy, way too small, and don't feature a lip to keep stuff on the table. These are TV trays in name only. If all you ever do is eat a bowl of cereal on the couch, these will work fine. You can't find the old TV trays anymore. They are now ""vintage"" or ""retro."" Apparently the Chinese have no idea what constitutes a real TV tray."
5,One of our greatest wedding gifts!,We received these trays as a wedding gift and they are one of the most used items in our house. The rack to hold the trays makes it very handy to store them. The trays are also very sturdy so they can be used for end tables when you are just starting out and lack furniture. They clean up nice and have a nice finish. I would highly suggest purchasing them for yourself or buying them as a gift.
1,Poor Craftsmanship,"I ordered this item as a gift and was embarrassed when one tray broke during assembly. The wood used was poor quality and full of knots, which caused the breakage and an overall unattractive appearance. Buyer beware."
4,Great construction,Love the tables. They were easy to put together and are solid. Only problems were some marring of the wood and some filled in areas that don't look great. But if you are looking for some TV trays that can get beat up and it won't matter these are the ones. Good value for the $$.
3,"Nice construction, but low-quality materials","I ordered a set of these tray tables as a gift, and was quite happy with how sturdy and useful they were. However, two of the tables were made of wood with very large knots that had simply been filled with wood glue and sanded down before being lacquered or whatever. Another was smeared with streaks of glue. I was a bit ashamed to be giving this flawed gift, but returning them would have been a huge hassel: The box weighed like 35 pounds and the nearest Target store is hours from where I live. (Even then, in the past I haven't been able to return items ordered online to Target stores, anyway.)You might want to go to the store and check out the actual merchandise you're buying, rather than ordering online."
2,Dogs didn't care for it,It is a bit too heavy for my dogs and I had trouble getting it to hold food and treats.
4,Ball For Bigger Dogs,My Dogs are 20 - 25 lbs. This ball would be great for a lab or German Shepard but was too big for my smaller dogs to play with. They nose it around once in awhile but for the most part they do not play with it and I feel it has more to do with the size than the ball.
2,Will Not Last More than Minutes for Heavyduty Chewers,"I have a 6-year old cattle dog who loves toys and chasing and chewing them to shreds. I've been trying to find toys that can last more than a week or two with him.This ball unfortunately did not withstand his chewing. Within about 15 minutes he was already able to chew off significant bits and pieces of the ball. Even worse, he ate the pieces so I immediately confiscated the ball. The slatted design in the rubber makes it even easier for strong jaws to grab hold and break off the bits.He did enjoy chewing it but if your dog is a strong chewer who regularly tears up toys, this purchase may likely be money down the drain for you too.The product does seems well made with high quality material, so if your dog doesn't view his life purpose as breaking down objects with his jaws of life, this would probably still be a good toy for tossing and light chewing."
1,Buy the Kong version. This is garbage.,"Get the kong brand toy that looks similar to this one. It will hold up against aggressive chewers, this one won't. Our puppy ripped it apart in minutes."
1,It was torn apart in 5 minutes,I searched the internet for a toy for laboradors that was tough. I admit that alot of the toys did not look tough to me. But this one did. It lasted five minutes. I was extremely disappointed.
1,Yep. It's definitely blue. And extremely shoddy.,"This item is very poorly made and sized, even by the poor standards of children's Halloween costumes. Setting aside the atrocious build quality and bizarre dimensions (why are the legs so long? why is the neck hole so huge? a thirty inch belt for a four year old?) let's cut straight to the deceptive image used all over the web for this outfit.This costume contains no gloves, just the wrist bands. I have no idea how they managed to get the ""boot""s to look decent in the picture. They are nothing more than insubstantial flaps. The color, as others have suggested is royal blue (like classic Batman). In no way and under no light could it appear as it does in the image pictured.Completely phony and misleading.That aside, the fit is so bizarre that our four-year-old won't be able to wear it without major modifications. I'd recommending buying something else so you are not stuck with the same issues."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This is a very low-quality costume, and we were VERY disappointed with it. Everywhere it is sewn there are hanging loose threads, the seams on the mask were not aligned/sewn correctly (therefore it does not sit on your head the right way, one of the ears folds down, and one side is much longer than the other), they used WHITE thread to sew on the chest applique which makes the loose un-knotted threads REALLY obvious against a royal blue & yellow background, the edge of the cape looks horrible (really sloppy machine stitching, and of course, a billion loose threads hanging everywhere), the belt is really thin and cheap felt, and on and on and on. Keep in mind, I only noted the HUGE problems with it. I would definitely recommend NOT wasting your money on this costume; in reality it looks nothing like the one depicted in the photo. Get something else!"
4,Great Costume,Totally awesome costume! Very original. Great craftsmanship! Costume is fairly form fitting so make sure that you buy a larger size if you are going to layer your child's clothing. Cannot wear a coat under the costume.
1,NOT what I expected,"The original Bat girl is purple, as is the picture of this product. The costume that I recieved is Blue, royal blue.The Medium is supposed to fit a size 6, according to the description. It fits about an 8-10.Overall not what I wanted."
1,poor quality,sizes are not as they say - too big - yet the cape is more for a 2 yr old - i ordered this for my 6 yr old daughter. boot coverings were of poor quality as were the arm bands. many strings hanging from various places/seems on the costume. mask was a joke. way too much money for this item.
3,"Great Costume, but strange sizing","This costume was full of all the right stuff, and quite fun, however, the sizing is off. Size small was too small for my 8 yr old petite daughter, and the medium could fit me! I did quite a few alterations and in the end it fit. I would recomend this, but keep in mind that you may have to be handy."
3,Fun,My daughter loved this. Had to stitch a few spots after a party but otherwise good quality. Def recommend for your little crime fighter.
3,not necessary,Used this to prepare for 2009 boards. Does not add much to board review book from ACCP and much more cumbersome. Good book to go to sleep to though...
4,Great!,"Out of the many Crystals cd's, this is one of the best! It has their classic ""Then He Kissed Me"" on it which is awesome. I think it's a great buy!"
1,Beware,"The track ""I Put a Spell on You"" on this CD is NOT the radio version. The rest of the CD is unremarkable and is going to the thrift store."
5,great bag,"This bag works much better than a heavy bag. The heavy bag will sway back and forth and you have to stabilize it whereas this stays in place for the most part.It is sturdy and the striking surface is made of a sturdy foam material as opposed to the heavy bag which has something else that settles to the bottom of the bag.The instructional DVD did not come with a cover but it was instructional to me as a novice on how to throw punches, combinations and kicks and also how to use the wavemaster.I would recommend this over a heavy bag."
3,All items not in box,I received my Century Super X Wavemaster Stand Heavy Bag but the bag gloves and workout DVD were not included. I looked everywhere but they just were not there. As far as the bag.... I love it!!! Just wish I had all that I paid for.
2,"Good, but, not great.","I bought this product a while ago, and while it is a good bag, the base is what holds my biggest gripe. With only a 270lb capacity, punching is rather loud, as the base lifts and slams back down. The dvd as others have said, not the greatest, nor are the gloves. But aside from the noise, dvd and the gloves, it's a decent buy if you're just using it for fitness."
3,Who would put up with a shrew like Cameron?,"I couldn't agree more with some of the comments about the main character Cameron. She is the most self-centered, spoiled character I have ever read. She never even attempts to listen to any one else's opinions and thoughts. Though I suppose if she did, there wouldn't have been this second novel. I can't for the life of me figure out how Jackson would find anything she did even remotely appealing. Too bad this wasn't a book about Taye, it would have been so much more appealing."
3,A little long for such a trite book.,"I couldn't decide if this was a book which reminded me of Gone With the Wind or not. There is the same selfish but likeable woman character and the mysterious but heroic man she is in love with all centered around her desperation to return to her southern home after the Civil War. Yet, the main characters did not inspire me to feel sorry for them because they didn't have the same kind of hardship that the other characters had to face. So, although I enjoyed the book and thought the subplots were interesting and well-written I cannot give this book more than 3 stars."
3,A Painful Read,"I am a fan of Rosemary Rogers. However, Cameron has got to be the most self centered, bratty character, she has ever created. I couldn't stand her and plodded through the first novel. I misplaced this novel and was in no big hurry to find it. A better heroine would have been Taye. Let Taye be the main character and Cameron be in the periphery. All the drama really centered on Taye anyway in both books. I don't demand to like everything about my heroines. However, I never really got to appreciate anything about Cameron. I did not see her suffering like her poor sister. There is nothing heroic about Cameron except providing jobs for workers. Taye is the real heroine. If there is another book about this family, let it be about Taye and Falcon."
3,A nice paperback overview,"If you can find a copy of this book, it's a short but sweet biography which concentrates on Gene Kelly's film career. Since it is part of the Pyramid Illustrated History of the Movies series, that is to be expected.You'll find plenty of black and white photographs and reviews of Kelly's films. The book was published in 1976 so it understandably ends well before Mr. Kelly's death. For a more in-depth look, I'd suggest either Clive Hirshhorn's biography ""Gene Kelly"" or Tony Thomas's ""The Films of Gene Kelly."" Considering that there are only a few books about Mr. Kelly that have been published, this is well worth picking up if you're a fan."
4,Tough set up but easy to use,"The setup instructions is extremely poorly prepared. There are many parts without specific step by step instructions which will take a while to figure out. Once you get past installation, the product is fairly easy to use (after getting use to). The easy detachable feature plus ability to tilt the unit on your handlebar is great."
3,resets after 999.99 KM or miles,"I wanted to keep this product because Topeak has AWESOME customer service. But after seeing that it resets after 999.99 miles/km I decided to send it back.Too bad, they make good bike products."
3,Topeak Panoram V12 mini review,"Item arrived fairly quickly and arrived as described. Working and used it several times. It is small (given the mini description), so I can't complain about that although I'm wishing I had something larger. It's so small it is somewhat difficult to read some of the display. All in all it is a good little wireless cyclometer and for the price is hard to beat."
2,Ehhh. Not too happy,"The piece looks and mounts awesome. It's tiny, about as big as the top of the neck. It's too bad my total distance keeps resetting itself. The whole purpose of getting this thing is so that I would have a odometer and could tell how many total miles my bike has ridden. So my plan was thwarted. Next, thing goes through batteries every 30 miles. So I'm looking at about an extra $2.10 every other day. I would not buy another one of this model. Too bad cause the thing is so little. I hope you have better luck than I did."
3,Love the concept,Great functions. Agree it is a bit challenging to setup but ends up fine. Dissapointed in the accuracy - seems to skip a lot on speed readings even thought the battery is new and the sensors are clearing per specs. Ended up replacing it with another unit.
2,Am I missing something?,"Seems like the reviews are pretty positive here. Did I get a different product???It was VERY confusing to install. The directions are in a billion (ok, maybe 8) languages on a giant, 2-sided piece of fold-out paper, and it jumps around all over the paper- English step 1 in the top left, English step 2 somewhere in the middle back, etc.Also, and more importantly, it's VERY cheap. The handle holder for the computer broke after 2 uses. The myriad of little pieces never seemed to be a perfect fit.I'd say- if you're experienced at putting these things on bikes, have enough patience to sift through the directions and make sense of them immediately, and want a good price deal, go for it. If any of the above are not true, pass on it."
1,Beware Old unit,I have given this lowest rating because it is not clear that on line that this will not work with the new Rokenbok system. This only works with older technology and should not be purchased unless you already have the old controller. I wish I had seen something on this before I purchased. Now I am stuck with a vehicle that is not usable with the new system. The site is deciving because they show purchasing with the Sweeper and a remote controller. The remote controller will not work with this unit. I am unhappy with this purchase from Amazon. I can not return because box has sticker that says no return if opened.
2,Too Old and Too Expensive,"This was a great book in its day. Unfortunately, Dr. Hurwitz has passed away since this edition was published, so who knows if it will be updated. I hate to give it only two stars, but in 2001 this early 90s book is too old an too expensive.Bernard Cohen's Pediatric Dermatology is easier to read/use and is mor current (1999) and has better pictures. I strongly recommend it over this book."
4,Davis Redford Triad - 'Blue Cloud' (Holy Mountain),"Band's third actual CD release. Best described as 'experimental space rock'. Not a bad effort to listen to late at night. Tunes here I liked the most were ""Loop 03"", the sixteen-minute epic ""Mellowed For Over 80 Million Years"" (possibly the disc's best track - hands down), ""Clear Path To The Future"" and the title cut ""Blue Cloud"". I know I should go to the label site and see what other titles they have. Just might appeal to fans of Steven Wray Lobdell, Faust and Six Organs Of Admittance."
4,Fair enough,"I bought this as a present for my husband, and even thought I didn't like the gray stripes on the frame, I think they look pretty nice. My husband has round face structure and this sunglasses look great on him, besides, I must say the weight its perfect, ultra light... for the price they are good enough, I just would prefr them in black...."
4,Almost a let-down.,"I purchased From Mars to Sirius when it first came out and was blown away. It still hasn't left my disc changer. I purchased The Link hoping for more of the same, but I didn't quite get it. They're still Gojira, but this release sounds a little more... crisp. If fMtS is a boulder rolling down a hillside at your face, The Link is a small, jagged rock screaming from David's sling... at your face. Each sound is definite. On fMtS, the vocals were layered (I'm assuming) to make them thick and rumbling. On The Link, they're a single track (again, assuming) to make them sharp and peircing. The instruments come across the same way. Great album, but it's not fMtS... which is good."
4,Pretty good. Definitely worth the watch.,"Well, this is definitely an impressive video, and it's still a quality cartoon today. This was a great series in the late 70's, and it'd be cool if it came back on TV, but in the meantime, we can watch it on videos like this one. This is very good entertainment, and you'll likely watch it more than once. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars was an annoying promotion thing before the show with Space Ghost as a talk show host.... but once you get to the show, it's a good video."
