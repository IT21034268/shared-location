1,Punk? Not really.,"Ok, first off, this is possibly the worst album that MxPx has ever recorded. Punk is not puck anymore. New Found Glory, Blink 182, Good Charlotte, and other bands, who claim to be punk, turn out to be very middle of the road, pop-ish sounding. I really liked MxPx on their earlier stuff. It was more raw. It was less commercialized. It was the closest thing to punk that MxPx ever got. I feel like I wasted the money I spent for the CD. I don't want anyone to think that I'm ""dissing"" MxPx. I love 'em. I wish they would have spent more time and made something with more quality. Not this."
3,Okay now for the actual review...,"Alright after listening to this, I must say that I'm very dissappointed. I mean I was hoping that they'd evolve their sound on the renaisance, but sadly they actually sold out this time. They sound exactly like the band that imitate them, ala Good Charlotte, Blink 182, and Green Day. I mean they gave up their trademark sound. They are no longer punk, they've now eveolved into a pop-rock band. This is, in my oppinion, their worst CD. Musically they play find, but it's now as technical as their other stuff. Tracks Rating:1.) Before 1/52.) Play it Loud 4/53.) Well Adjusted 5/54.) It's Alright 5/55.) Brokenhearted 2/56.) First Day of the Rest of our Lives 2/57.) Quit Your Life 5/58.) Everything Sux (When You're Gone) 2/59.) More Everything 2/510.) Kings of Hollywood 3/511.) The Capitol 2/512.) On the Outs 5/513.) Don't Walk Away 1/514.) You Make Me, Me 2/515.) You're Not Alone 2/516.) After 1/5"
5,Never fails to amaze me!,"Mxpx has done such a rad job on this new album. It really shows what talent they have and passion for their music. I think its so rad how they always relate the songs to their lives. Ive been such a big fan of theirs for a long time and you can really hear how much they have grown in this new album. Its rad to see how they love to change up their sound and not afraid to try new things mixing it with old school sounding mxpx (heh)(pokinatcha,sgwb,teenage pol.etc..)and not forgetting to show us they havent forgotten how to rock out. The new cd has so many rad songs that are fun to just rock out to! so pick up the new cd you wont regret it!!!!!!!!!!"
5,GREATNESS,"GREATNESS... thats this cd in one word. this cd is awsome, its hasn't left my cd player since i bought it and every single track is worthy to be called great. ACT now and get your copy"
2,The black sheep,"This cd isnt good at all.It sounds almost as if they tried to sell out but failed miserably.I think that even they realize that it wasnt a very good cd.If you listen to their newest release ""Panic"" you'll realize that they had to take a step back and take a second look at things.If this cd didn't exist then I could say that MxPx is flawless."
2,Is it Good Or is It Good Charlet,"I'v been with mxpx sice the begging. If you like the old days when they were real indepent PUnk then this CD is realy not for you. If you like Good Charlet then but the album and have fun.(yuck)I personly did not enjoy it much but it does have it's moments and i am happy that i purchased the CD. It is more like the ""Ever Passing Moment"". In all it was not the best CD they have produced. They did do a lot of special effects and very good mixing that i did enjoy. But the CD is less punck and More Popy."
5,best mxpx cd yet,"to sum it up for you without making this review too long, before everything and after is the best mxpx cd yet. you wont be disappointed, mxpx have really matured, mxpx is a great band with fun to listen to music about all different topics ranging from past girl friends to their faith in god, they've been around for over 10 years now, but keep getting better and better. over all, i think before everything and after is a great cd, and i would recommend it, theres not a bad song on it."
2,Sandwich maker?,"I was hoping this book would have some new recipes that I could use with my sandwich maker. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. If you like to use a variety of fillings and don't mind mixing obscure foods together, then this book is for you. I was looking for recipes that used ingredients that you may already have."
2,Depends on what you want it for,"We wanted some Aussie style songs to play at a BBQ. Almost all of the songs are more serious than I wanted for the party, but the few fun lighthearted songs were nice. We used only 5 or so of the 40 songs on this CD. I would not purchase this CD for that kind of party again, but it does have some very nice songs.Try a John Williamson album for more kid friendly Aussie style songs."
4,"Good price, works great, easy to put together,...","I bought this to fill a temporary need and aside from appearance chose it for the price and free shipping. It is very nice looking, gives off good light and was easy to put together. It only took about 5 mins from start to finish to take out of the box, put together and plug in.The only thing missing is the dimmer but if your light switch to a dimmer switch; you won't even care."
4,Not too bad...,Honestly - I was hoping for something a little heavier - similar to another brand I get - but these thinner shirts are actually prettywell suited for the hotter weather where I live and they really do not shrink *much* in the first few washes.I will probably buy more of them.
5,THEY NO TITLE,THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORET GAME. BUT I HAVE IT FOR GAMECUBE. BUT I KNOW IT IS COOL BECAUSE I PLAYED IT. I LOVE THIS MARIO GOLF GAME
4,Totally addicting!,"I picked this up yesterday afternoon while on my way to work. I had some downtime at work and decided to give it a go for a few minutes. Well needless to say a few minutes turned into 2 hours! The story mode can be a little slow and tedious, however it's great to be able to customize your character. There are alot of great options to play and the graphics are pretty cool. If you have some experience playing Mario Golf for GameCube, you can move up on levels in this game pretty quickly. It's ALOT of fun and definately worthe the investment. I recommend this as one of the best golf game for GB Advance."
4,Different,"This game has been a lot of fun for me. It reminds me a lot of the old Hotshots games with the added bonus of tweakin your own golfer out. Another thing I like is the fact that you can unlock a whole lot more features by connecting to Toadstool Tourney on the Gamecube and you can play your character on that. Gain more bonus stuff on Mario Golf TT for Mario Golf AT like additional Golfers like Luigi, Waluigi, and Wario. Also Can get the rest of the Star Holes for the courses. Overall the game is fun and probably will be more fun with Mario Golf TT"
4,Cool Game,Not the best game in the world but its a great golf game all together. I like this much more than any Tiger Woods style golf game b/c it poses a little more than a challege. Worth a try.
4,Excitement around every corner,"I'm an 11 year old how knows hardly anything about golf. This was the very first game I got for my Game boy and I love it! I stayed up untill 2 in the morning playing it!!! The first time you play, you get to choose between two characters ; a boy named Neil or a girl named Ella. Don't worry , you can change their namesto whatever you like! You belong to the Mario Club.You go to one of the four golf clubs, which are Mario , Dunes , Palms and Links and you can enter their tourney. You can do doubles with Neil or Ella , or singles , which is by yourself . If you get 1st , 2nd , or 3rd place , you get a trophey to keep in your room and you also get to enter another club's torney. After you win the Links you can choose to go to Peache's Castle and play the Mushroom course. This game goes on for a while , but it is one I'd highly recomend."
5,Punk-Blues Pinnacle,"Gun Club manages to melt punk rage, blues-drenched despair and schizophrenic psychobilly on their unforgettable, fantastic debut. Drived by Jeffrey Lee Pierce sneaky, eerie voodoo-howls, the wailing, bleak, storming up tempo guitar of Ward Dotson and the fierce manic beat of Rob Ritter-Terry Graham rhythm section, the band delivered their songs - haunting tales of sex, terror, damnation, violence & desperate love - with harsh, passionate abandon. Pierce's career was short and tragic, but he had the firepower to lead this fantastic combo through the recording of an album of timelessly roughshod and unruly psycho-punk-blues, perhaps the first - and easily the best - of its kind. ""Fire of Love"" is bona-fide rock'n'roll bliss, an album that defies time idyosincrasies and music ephemeral fashions."
5,Originality that doesn't suck,"Jeffrey Lee Pierce is amazing. This album is the one to buy...some may prefer 'Miami', but I believe this is the Gun Club at their best.Their sound is unique but can be compared to early Violent Femmes, but more heroin and blues. Yeah punk rock/heroin/blues that's what I would try to describe it as (not label it). In my humble or bad opinion, every song is a winner; ""...I will fu** you til you die, bury you and kiss this town goodbye uh hey hey"".... They just don't write them like that anymore!Great songs, all of them, but I have been remembering and singing in my head(like a nut job)'Jack on Fire', 'She's Like Heroin To Me', For The Love of Ivy', 'Ghost on the Highway', and 'Fire Spirit'.If you are interested in the Gun Club for what ever reason, then you are, in my opinion, on the right path. Buy Fire of Love it is a solid choice, your parents will love you more, and chicks/dudes will dig you.Trivia- Vince Neil of Mutley Crud swiped his look from Jeffrey Lee Pierce."
1,"Beware, beware!!!!",There is a big problem with this disc. It plays perfectly on the Bose CD player but if you play it from your computer or IPod there is heavy static and distortion. I returned the disc and received a replacement but the replacement disc has the exact same problem. Amazon's return and replacement policies and execution were excellent by the way. I'll be returning the replacement and checking out Amazon marketplace for this disc. This was the first time I have returned a product to Amazon.
3,"Good, but odd selection","A good collection, but why O'Neill's Desire Under the Elms rather than one of the big three (Iceman, Moon, Long Day's)? Why All My Sons by Miller rather than Death or Crucible? Why Glaspell's Verge at all, when Inge and Rice, much better playwrights, are left out entirely?"
4,Book for a class,I had to buy this book for a class. I liked how much was compiled into one book. The intros about the authors and commentary on their works were a nice touch.
4,great bag,"This bag is great to keep just the necessities and it will hold all your stuff (water, wallet, cell phone & keys) plus your babies. The material is crunchy and noisy but does not make noise while walking only when reaching in and getting something."
3,Nice but could of been better!,"Pantoja, although endowed with a gifted voice, she is singing in a ""safe zone."" The last 4 albums sound very similar and generic. Pantoja necesita cambiar autores si quiere grabar disco de primera calidad como: Marinero de Luces, Desde Andalucia y De Nadie."
2,note smaller than should be Rain shield,"The tent has a very nice enclosure space for up to three people and possibly a cot. The ventilation is very up to date with large vents on all sides.--But when I put the Rain Shield on it did not cover the ventsor windows enough and would permit rain to drip/run into the tents inner area, which makes this tent unsuitable for all weather conditions."
1,BEWARE WHEN ORDERING THIS ITEM,I placed an order for this item the 1st week in May 2007 and I was told the item would not ship until 6/25/2007. Today 6/22/2007 I receive an email from Amazon telling me that the item is still on back order and will now have an estimated ship date in mid August 2007. Another 6 weeks?Total estimated shipping time is now greater than 3 months???If I had known that the item would not ship for 3+ months I would not have ordered it since this is an item that WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT AVAILABLE. Please BEWARE if you purchase this item now because you will be placed in line behind all of the other suckers (myself included) who are still waiting 3+ months for theirs to ship... so your new order will probably take 6 months to ship.
2,"Bad instructions, bad install",Beware if your light box has the screws left to right because this thing was made to only work if the box has the screw holes up and down. You can unscrew the base of the light and turn it around but then the visible screws aren't in desirable position.Instructions aren't needed for most people but if you happen to need it then they aren't written very well.
5,From THE WASHINGTON POST:,"""Quite simply, there is not a better writer of fiction now at work in the United States.... In A WOMAN OF MEANS...the reader is transported into a place so faithfully similar to the real world, yet so imbued with a knowledge of it that none of us can hope to possess, that one is left breathless with admiration.&quot"
5,Review by Robert Penn Warren,"""No description of mere mortals or events of A WOMAN OF MEANS can indicate the particular kind of excitement it possesses--the excitement of being constantly on the verge of deep perceptions and deep interpretations.&quot"
1,This product is useless and a waste of money,I applied this product to some backpacks; it took 2 cans just to do 1 backpack. My coverage and saturation were perfect and I let the product cure for 3 days instead of 2 just to be safe. I had a friend over and wanted to show off my backpacks and I took my bottle of water and poured a little on the backpack and it soaked right in. Needless to say I was embarrassed because I had bragged that the packs had this product on them to repel water. Look for another brand; don't waste your time with this one.
5,Cheap waterproofing,"Not sure what everyone is doing to make this stuff not work. I owned a Jeep and used to spray this stuff on my cloth seats in case of rain. Without this spray the seats would soak up the water literally like a sponge and be wet for days. With this stuff sprayed on, the water would actually pool up on my seats for hours until I could splash it all off with my hands. Then I'd give the seat a quick wipe with a towel or my shirt sleeve and I could drive home with a dry butt.If this stuff can waterproof a cloth car seat, something must be going wrong for the other users who rated it poorly."
4,Deck Umbrella,I used two cans to waterproof my deck umbrella. It is now water resistant not waterproof. It will keep my table and guest's dry in a light rain but not during a heavy downpour which is fine as we would not want to stay out in a downpour anyway.
5,Super Product,Ibought this product for my boat canvas because the other products contained little silicone this is the ultimate waterproofing product a must buy!
1,horrible,"This is possibly the worst thing I have ever smelled or tastedtastes nothing like grapes, only feetI strongly advise against purchasing"
1,House Across The Bay,"The video tape arrived promptly. I was disappointed that the sound quality was very poor,a very loud buzz continued throughout the film after the first 10 minutes or so. I realize tape quality degrades overtime."
5,Mother's home cooking,"I acknowledge the Madman's points: most of the recipes in this book do not conform to today's dietary standards. But bear in mind that this book was first written over 70 years ago. That's when my mother got her copy. She still has it with the cover's half-torn off and pages stuck in loose and scribbled on. This was a Pennsylvania Dutch housewife's book of recipes for Pennsylvania Dutch housewives. They weren't worried about waistlines or BMI numbers. They needed to feed their families who worked in the fields or guests over for a holiday feast.I also agree that the strength is the desert section, but that is the specialty of the PA Dutch. My brother, sister, and I would spend winter days with mother making cookies from the recipes and I even took a turn at making the cream puff recipe once for a church social. They turned out great!Not only is this a wonderful recipe book, but to me, it is a family treasure."
4,Full of recipes!,"Lots of recipes. Being from central Pennsylvania a found a few I knew well, others were missing. Since it's all about where you've eaten this food and who is making it, it's really hard to cover everything but this does it well."
3,"different title, not quite the same book","Buyer beware: this is exactly the same book (except for title) as ""Weird and Wonderful Words"", which is listed here as being by Simon Winchester but in fact is also by Erin McKean. It's an enjoyable book, but you wouldn't want to buy it twice thinking you were getting a sequel.=========================================CORRECTION:My apologies to the beleaguered author - a more careful re-examination of the introduction does indeed disclose that this is a combination of the two previous books, and I'm sure it does include the additional new words. When I first opened it up, all the entries I looked at were repeats, so I jumped to a hasty conclusion.I do think, though, that online buyers need an advisory on this, as some others might otherwise make the same mistake I did, of thinking that this one is a third book ""totally"" different from the first two."
5,It's a keeper,"Whether a result of divine intervention or merely coincidence, the statistics from before and after the 1962 court decision speak for themselves. This book opened my eyes to data from before my birth that helped put things in perspective. I liked it. It was easy to read and understand. It's one I'll keep in my library and I'm sure you'll want to as well. Read the book and make your own decision. Too many people use these reviews as thier own personal soapboxes."
5,I love your music sparkle you is my dog,Sparkle you is a nice Black women &you Do no take no stuff from no man & I love that because some women take Alot stuff off mens
3,hard to describe,"this is a really bad movie but with lots of blood and gore and unintentional laughs. the narrative makes sense and some of the characters make you want to root for them by the end... even though the script/director did precious little to bring the principle characters to life.if Don't Go In The Woods Alone was from a first time director, i could easily understand and overlook the film's shortcomings. however, that is not the case. i haven't seen James Bryan's previous films, but i've heard they are good. so what happened here? i honestly don't know.if you like rough, backwoods exploitation, then it's worth seeing once or twice, but this is not a great film.D"
2,Terrible...so bad it's good!,"I gave this two stars because it is so bad it's actually good. The film is about four campers--who are the WORST actors in the world, and the girls look like guys--who are camping the woods. This freaky killer who looks like a crazy ogre is stalking and killing man y other campers in the Woods, who are all terrible actors themselves, with no significance whatsoever. Some start the scene with killing scenes. I think it's a horror comedy, cuz some of this stuff is hysterical! If you can find this is a movie store, I beg of you to pick it up and watch it! Your life will never be the same!"
1,"Poor effort, and it shows","Around this time--1981--many horror films were being set in the wilderness, featuring a group of backpackers whose fate ultimately is met via the hands of a deranged killer. Here, the premise is slightly different in that the ""deranged killer"" is actually a deranged ""wildman"", no less. Aside from that, not much is different. Though what brings the film down, as a whole, would have to be the almost nonexistent acting, paper-thin storyline (which is pretty bad considering most films of the sort have similar storylines), and the horrendous soundtrack, which sounds as if it were composed in a laundromat, atop a washing or drying machine. Though it remains a small favorite among the fans of the cheaper, cliche, nearly-forgotten slasher flicks of the 1980s, I can, unfortunately, only recommend the film for those who want to be shocked--for the wrong reasons."
2,Don't Go in the Woods,"DON'T GO IN THE WOODS is a bottom-rung ""Slasher in the woods"" entry that follows in the same tradition as JUST BEFORE DAWN and DELIVERANCE. A group of four pre-packaged victims head in to the woods on a camping trip, only to be killed off by a crazed mountain man in a timely fashion. The highly-untrained acting and directing are apparent in every moment of the film, and the story structure is almost non-existent. Only the weakest Slasher movie stereotypes and conventions shine through here, but for everything it lacks in quality, it more than makes up for in bloody killings. Severed limbs, missing heads, and gallons of blood are strewn across the screen, making it far more violent than many of the mid- to late-80's Slashers. Although DON'T GO IN THE WOODS is a terrible film by all accounts, the hardcore Slasher fans will find enough cheesy dialog and brutal deaths to make it worth the watch.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
1,All I can saw is wow,"I had heard about this movie for years and was excited to find it on dvd. All I can say is wow. This is one weird movie, the acting is awful and I found myself fast forwarding through the movie looking for anything scary or gruesome."
4,good slasher flick,this isn't an american movie. This movie was dubbed. I think it's a European movie. Better than most non-sequel slasher flicks in the early 80's. This movie was comedic and yet disturbing to watch even though it was heavily edited. This movie has great atmosphere and excellent cinematographry.
2,Not nearly good enough to buy,"Even though this book is inexpensive, I wouldn't recommend purchasing it. The job ideas are not inspiring, and not really up to date either. It barely skims the surface of what someone can do with an English major and/or writing experience, and never steps outside of the basic areas that you've probably already thought of yourself. It also doesn't give you a single idea as to how to break into any of the few jobs it mentions, if you happen to be looking for that kind of advice as well. Purchase something a little weightier and a little more expensive, it'll be worth it. This isn't."
2,Disappointed,"Sorry, but a book about women and television that doesn't have extensive sections devoted to soap operas cannot claim to be an encyclopedia. Very disappointed."
4,No Plain Brown Wrapper here!,"This book arrived in a clear plastic bag with the title visible. Lovemaps: Sexual/Erotic Health and Pathology, Paraphilia, and Gender Transposition... So if you care about anybody seeing what you're receiving, beware."
3,There are many other books at least as good for old car buffs.,"Pencil drawings and limited number, some interesting info and I don't mind adding this to my collection, but I would recommend looking at other books as being more helpful."
2,Blueberry Summer not for Today's Teens/Preteens,"For the first 160 pages or so the heroine mostly obsesses about her hairdo, weight, clothes, pesky younger brother, and two older boys, but then there is a dramatic event that makes intriguing reading for the last 30 pages or so, with a surprise ending, although if readers had been paying attention to this boring story, they would have not been surprised. This book was first published by Whittlesy House in 1956. Almost a half-century later, this book will seem somewhat quaint to today's young people.I read this book to find out why it was a favorite of another (deceased) author whose biography I am working on. I still can't figure out why."
4,Very entertaining!!!!!,"Like the title says, this game is very entertaining.It has easy controls with different gameplay.You find yourself saying ,Ill do just one more chapter, but you want to keep playing.IF you like RPG'S,This is A good one with tactics you must also use.A last detail is you put in your birthdate,name and time.This is A good , All around game.I would highly suggest this game."
4,fun but hard,ok this is a awsome game. you start out with one person and get people on the way. don`t let anyone die at the starting. but people will die sometime or another. i had twelve people on one level and the next five. i sugest you keep archers guarded because they are hard to come by. think about everything that can happen before moving and attacking. it gets harder and harder every level. dodge anyone with something poisond. to get charicters talk with evil people and go into towns. each chariter has a wepon and all wepons have a better. each lord may not die. if a lord dies you have to restart the level.
4,Awesome and Sweet,When I first got this game it was great the tactics for this game is good.And you really have to use your brain and think because enemies will kill your best sometimes.Some parts of this game are really hard to play.What makes this really hard is the guys you play with if they die then its game over don't worry you can start again though.All I've got to say for this game is it's great and not a waste of 30 bucks.This is the hardest game I've played next to another one of mine.THIS IS THE TOP TEN RPG GAMES OUT IN THE MARKET BUY IT!!!!!
5,"FIRE EMBLEM, THE BEST GBA GAME","Here is what I think of it.Graphics: 9/10 Battle graphics are great but when you look on the whole map you say, Which guy is that over there about to be slaughtered??? Each type has there own little picture with no differences. Everything else is perfect.Story: 10/10 A great story. Its not the typical, I wanna be the best thing.Gameplay: 10/10 When it comes to gameplay this game is perfect, perfect but hard. When one of your characters dies they are dead, no extra lives thing, and you can't trick the game by turning it off as they die. The game just shows you the same death scene again. Other than that there are tons of characters, I started to play thinking that I had all the characters but then I restarted and found a load more.Sound: 8/10 A bit repetitive, Ok though.Characters: 10/10 You get to like them after a while and you hate when they die.This game is great so GET IT!!!"
2,Saved games reset - *sigh*,"A fun strategy game overall, but has a major flaw - I can't stand any game that does not let you save anytime you want. I know this game allows you to save at anytime, but the game auto saves for you at the last turn, so that when you die you cannot revert to where you originally saved. I know the designers of Fire Emblem did this so to make the game more challenging or ""realistic"", so that players can't ""cheat"" by playing from that save point over and over again, but it actually makes the game more annoying and frustrating. If you character dies, by lets say a way to powerful and out of balanced mini boss attacking you and killing you with one shot, you have to start the whole stupid level over again.Otherwise, this game would have received 5 stars - trust me, you'll get frustrated and annoyed the 100th time you main character dies, and you are forced to play the level over again."
5,The Tatical RPG ive ever played,"I am quite fussy about the rpg's i play, but this beats them all. I've played Golden Sun (both), Castlevainnia 3, and Tatics Ogre:Knight of Lodis, which were all great and i thought they were the best. But this beats them all. The more balance between magic and physical damage is better, and it is just all around better. GET THIS GAME, YOU WOn't regret it. My Lord, it was good. if your looking for other games, the ones i mentioned were also awesome."
4,"if you dont like strategy , dont buy it","this game is the coolest of all. the first chapters are like an introduction but the chapters from 28 to the final are the a$$$$ of the game . if you lose a character do the reset trick : hold L and R buttons then press A and B at the same time. if you enter an arena and you will fight and oponent who is more powerful than you use the reset trick so you dont lose , if you will fight someone in the arena with a silver weapon ex :silver sword , silver axe , silver lance etc. dont fight him you will lose if it is a myrmidon.bye"
5,AWESOME GAME,Fire Emblem is the best game I have ever played on my GBA.STORYLINE: 5/5 Best around for a strategy gameMUSIC: 3/5 Better than I expectedGRAPHICS: 5/5 How can you get console-like graphics on a GBA? PLAY FIRE EMBLEM!CHARACTERS: 4/5 If only you could choose who joins you nextOVERALL: 5/5This is a must buy for players of the Advance Wars and other strategy RPGs
5,Intelligent Design,"Made by Intellegent Systems Who made Advance Wars. The series started in Japan in 1990 and became pretty popular. This game is the first in the series Storywise. The story is excellent and can change if you decide to play it over. The choices you make in the game will decide many factors including characters you get later in the game and even the ending. This is a stratagy/RPG game so if you only have half a brain, dont play it. The game is hard and frustrating, yet addictive and fun. If you like fantisy games you will love this. The music is well composed. The graphics are good but not excellent. And the story is one of the best ones. I would like to see the originals translated into english for a future release or as a download for the Nintendo Revolution.4.5/5.0"
1,Shouldn't be rated E,"I purchased this ?E? rated game for my son, and was surprised at the graphically violent nature of the introduction listed in the manual, as follows: ??All that was lost when mankind disrupted this balance with a sudden attack, a brutal slaughter that bathed the land in blood. Each fought for domination in a savage war that shook the foundations of nature itself.?I hardly consider the vivid imagery of this passage to be appropriate for all ages. Either the rating system is not suitably designed or this one slipped through the cracks."
5,"Cool, but tough","This game is sweet. That's really all I can say, Great story, great music, extremly tough, but you really like the charecters. Anyone who dissagrees, well they aren't mentally mature enoguh to enjoy it."
5,An interesting strategy game with a storyline.,"This was one of the first games I every played on a GBA. I enjoyed this game first and foremost for its characters and the way that they interacted (and all the support convos). I am also an RPG and strategy game fan, so this also contributed to my enjoyment of this game. However, if you are not a big fan of turn-based games, and do not want to start a chapter over many times, then you may have difficulty liking this game. One of my gripes with this game is that I was always afraid to buy items for fear of not having enough money for the next shop. And the fact that some of the characters didn't seem all that useful (although, I could just have bad luck with the leveling up). All in all, I do suggest that you give this game a try."
3,smaller than expected,"I got this for our big horses and cannot use it. It fits our smaller horses (up to 16H well). Quality is good, too bad they don't come in XXXL!"
1,A few basic writing courses wouldn't go astray,"I must admit I picked this up wanting a bit of lighthearted pulp for the airplane. So I wasn't expecting too much. But it appears I overestimated the quality of Ms. Bleasdale's writing. Creating a believable character does not mean relaying every thought in her head (and then repeating them again and again and again throughout the book). Rather than telling us ""She thought this, she thought that"" this book would have benefited more by letting the characters interact in a believable fashion and letting us learn to know them that way. Throwing the entire backstory at us in the first 20 pages was a big mistake - those pages should have been taken out in editing the first draft. We, the readers, like to work some stuff out for ourselves. Show rather than tell.Additionally 3 out of 4 sentences started with ""She did, She looked, She was, She could."" That's dull and annoying. Finally sentences can be longer than four words. Yes, they can."
1,the spirit of the lord is here,i would like to review it But i can't i never heard the cd. i thought i can here on here. if i can please mail me back the info and i'll do a better review. i would love to here it so i can see if i like the album
4,good for all fans,"Although it's not as detailed as I wish it was, this is still a fine book that gives enough insight on the music and the life of Neil Young to make me enjoy it. There are good stories told in here and the book contains a song-by-song analysis of everything Neil did from Buffalo Springfield up until Looking Forward by Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. It covers a lot of material and if you're looking for a good Neil Young book, get this."
3,Mediocre,"Unfortunately now that Neil has apparently scuttled the authorized bio supposedly due this year (he's actually being sued by the author!)we have to make due with plodding efforts like this which is obviosly compiled from other sources and contains no first hand info from Neil and maybe none from people who actually know Neil. The book is well researched though and the writing is passable, which is better than a lot of rock bios"
1,Do no buy if you plan to siphon gas from car,I should have read the one bad review first. Come to find out that THESE DO NOT FIT IN A GASOLINE CAR as the are just a hair too large; they were obviously designed this way. I had bought two of these and now cannot use them for the intended use. Now I have to find others. The reason I am giving 1 star only because it was not advertised that it would not fit. Please add this comment to the description so others are not misled.
5,Great Item to have around the house,"These siphons were designed to siphon gasoline from a gas container (as a 5 gal or 1 gal gasoline container) into a lawn mower, vehicle, etc.They are not designed to be used to siphon gas from a vehicle to a container.When used properly these siphons are the the A-1 item to have around the house."
3,Hopkins FloTool 10801 Shaker Siphon with 6' Anti-Static Tubing by Hopkins,Great idea.Mine works fair on smaller gas cans.Works good on large gas cans.One end was not secured well and had to fix it.
4,It's magic,"Great little tool and it works like magic. The only problem is that you need room to ""shake"" the end so it isn't so great in tight squeezes like siphoning gas from narrow generator gas tanks. Works great for other liquids in regular gas cans or tanks."
1,Should have read reviews - does not fit into car gas tank,Good thing this item was cheap cause now it is useless to me. I bought it to siphon gas from my car to a gas can for use in my generator during the recent gas shortage/hurricane sandy event.The description of the item should have stated:THIS SIPHON WILL NOT WORK IN A CAR GAS TANK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Hose Kinks,This hose kinks very easily. The wall thickness is too thin. When your siphoning something and the hose lays over a edge it will bend and kink.
1,Useless,"First time I have been taken on an internet purchase. This, quite simply put, does not work but isn't worth the trouble or cost to send it back. Just hope others don't try it with the same expectations that I had. I bought it to transfer diesel fuel from a 5 gal can into my pickup but can't get it to siphon anything at all. It's poorly made and apparently not tested before delivering to a customer."
1,Doesn't Work,It doesn't work. I sat there shaking it like a fool for half an hour and got nothing but sweaty and really mad. If you look at all the positive feedback on here it sounds like words from a commercial. They are obviosuly product investors or something. This thing is worthless. The only positive feedback I have is that I only lost 9 bucks.
1,Haven't been able to make it work,"I bought this to use to drain a firepit that has not drain and fills with rain sometimes. But I couldn't seem to make it work. Then I tested it on a kiddie pool filled with water and got nowhere also. I may just cut the end off and use the tubing and do it the old-fashioned way, since I'm just working with water and not fuel."
1,shaker end,Put it into gas tank of my C3 scooter. end fell off into tank! Need advice how to get it out safely!!!!!!!!
1,doesn't work,"you can shake it or you can bake it, but it doesn't siphon. I could never get it to start even though the outlet was lower than the inlet."
4,Doesn't quite work in the gas tank,"I purchased this because I wanted to drain the gas tank easily, since the fuel pump was broken and it needed to be restored. Unfortuantely it just wouldn't start the suction.I ended up dropping the tank with all of its fuel. Turned out to be around 8 gallons. Then dumped it into a 5 gallon bucket, then siphoned into gas cans. It worked great out of the bucket and in to the gas can."
1,Not worth it!,"Disappointing performance. I bought it to siphon water contaminated gasoline from a built in tank in a small outboard boat. The mechanics are such that you need lots of verticle clearance to ""pump the tube vigorously."" Can't be done in a constricted curving fill pipe.It might be good for emptying a barrel or hot tub.Gave it away!"
2,"Not able to get it to prime via the ""pump""","I have tried about 6 times, shaken it more than 80 times each try, but cannot get it to prime enough fluid to be functional. I have used it on a malfunctioning bathroom toilet. I am simply trying to remove water from a toilet tank (clean water), & transfer it to the toilet bowl. Each time, I have had to resort to the old fashion method of using my mouth to prime the hose & get the water flowing. Big disappointment! It could be ""operator error,"" but I am very mechanically experienced; I have not been able to make this thing functional. Also, the hose leeches a strong plastic odor for WEEKS. I had to place it outside for a month, but the smell is still overwhelming when I place it in a small room for an hour."
3,a better mouse trap,the tubing could be a bit larger to make it faster.Used it to transfer fuel in the recovery area of Sandy
4,Shaker Siphon,"To my surprise it works - only need some ""try and error"".I am recommend it to you!Cheap but doing great job - I clean up my generator from gas."
2,metal tip won't fit into unleaded car gas tank!,The overly large metal tip of the siphon would NOT fit into an unleaded car or truck gas tanks; which makes it a poor choice for siphoning for most of the cars on the road today!
3,Plan on Buying Extra Tubing,"The brass siphoning mechanism works well, but a 6' tube just isn't long enough. The end of the tube has to be lower than the water level you're draining from, and the starting the siphon takes a few extra inches as well. I had to go to my local hardware store and buy an extension tube and coupler at a cost of about $8, so keep that in mind when you're deciding on whether to get this or something a little longer. I'm taking off a few stars because that extra expense hurt the overall value of the product."
1,Can only fit into a diesel tank.,I wasted my money on this because it is too wide to fit into the fuel filler neck on a vehicles' gas tank that is not a diesel.
2,I think I wasted my money,"I bought this to transfer gasoline out of my motorcyle to a gas can for fueling up my yard tools around the house - lawn mower, weed eater, blower etc.The problem is, you have to insert the ""shaker"" end into the gas tank and then shake the hose to get the fuel to flow. When I tried to do it, the metal lip of the gas tank started gouging into the hose, and scraped of pieces of it which then flaked off into my gas tank. Also the shaker end got caught in the tank and I had to spend several minutes manipulating the hose around to get it out.I suppose it would work well if you were transferring gasoline from a gas can to the actual yard tool - but why not just pour it in? At this point, I would be afraid to stick it in the tank of my S10, my other source for yard equipment gas, because it might end up stuck. I ended up taking the shaker part off and just used the hose to siphon the gas :("
1,Don't order this.,"It arrived dirty and even after I polished it, it looked cheap. I ended up giving it away and never wore it once."
2,Written by children....enough said,"This book is a horrid display of an attempt to copy other genres in literature. What story these days does not speak of fantasy fiction adventures. To start off, the plot in the story was horribly constructed while the character development goes nowhere. I finish the story not knowing who anyone is. I feel as if i were reading a horrible novel in 8th english class being taught by Mrs. Van. I will not be looking forward to any sort of sequel none the less recommened it to anyone of my colleagues. As far as the editing for this poor piece, one might advise the editor to have some knowledge of constructing a decent piece of literature. As a note to the authors of the book, I greatly recommend you stay in school and learn more about writing good literature."
1,"book is likely FICTION, author accused of fabricating story!","I would like to point out that this book postures itself as non-fiction, yet journalist investigations in Australia, where the author now resides, as well as by prominent women's organizations in Jordan, have discovered serious factual flaws in the text. These flaws suggest that the story is fabricated, and thus falls into the category of fiction, rather than non-fiction. The sensationalism inspired by the book at its release would not have taken place had the book been correctly categorized as fiction. I urge any potential reader to bear in mind that the content of this book is factually incorrect.The press addressed this issue during the last week of July, 2004. Amazon.com does not allow reviewers to put URL's within an Amazon.com review, so do a web search and find the articles for yourself."
5,culture shock,"Going through the reader reviews, my concern for the misunderstanding between the West and Middle East is disturbingly reinforced, and I'm shocked that many Arab readers have this ""she should have known"" response and protest their culture is being insulted, one that murders thousands of their own and deny themselves truly loving relationships that can only exist with freedom. I'm also feeling a little less concerned with the ""why they hate us"" question. It seems a lot like wondering why a rascist would hate Martin Luther King."
4,Honor Lost,"I think this book really explains how women in ""modern"" day Jordan are being treated. The book reads like a novel, and for a minute, you almost forgot that this REALLY happened and continues to happen every single day.I had heard of Honor Killings before but never really understood them. The fact that the US supports Jordan at all is horrible. We have taken a stand against human right problems in China, and other countries but not against so-called Honor Killings in the Middle East. How any father/brother can treat their family in this way is insane and very scary! I do not believe that anyone has the right to kill in the name of ""God""! And to think, that we even consider Jordan ""modern"" - after reading this book I think women all over the world need to take a stand against this type of treatment. I know I will."
1,Its a fake.,"The Sydney Morning Herald and Age newspapers in Australia have revealved this book - published in Australia as ""Forbidden Love"" - to be a literary hoax. It is not a ""real life story"" as claimed:From the above: Khouri's real name is Norma Majid Khouri Michael Al-Bagain Toliopoulos, and she only lived in Jordan until she was three years old. She has a US passport and lived from 1973 until 2000 in Chicago. She is married with two children, 13 and 11. She has four American siblings and a mother who are desperate to hear news from her."
1,fraudulent,"for all those who claim to be reading this book for a research project, please put it down. those who have done real work on this, like rana husseini, have been at the forefront of those decrying this fraudulent book. if you honestly care about the victims of so-called honor killings then at least do them the justice of searching for the truth. something that cannot be found here."
4,clash of modern and traditional,I had visited Jordan several times and had no clue of the issues brought forward in this book. Very interesting clash of modern and traditional value systems.
1,LIAR LIAR LIAR,"I lived in Amman, and I am familiar with every little detail of the area this so called author mentioned in her hoax. When I read the book, it was clear to me she was making the whole thing up. The place she worked did not exist. The streets and the places she mentioned are just that, fiction. It turns out she is a sought after criminal from Chicago. What compels people like her to write such a story, are simple: greed and hate.The story can be very moving to the naive who is not familiar with Jordan and the Middle East in general.This book is not worth the ink it is printed with. Don't waste you time."
1,"retitled or not, it's still a fake","As other reviewers have noted, this story has been exposed as fiction/propaganda:Khouri's real name is Norma Majid Khouri Michael Al-Bagain Toliopoulos, and she only lived in Jordan until she was three years old. She has a US passport and lived from 1973 until 2000 in Chicago. She is married with two children, 13 and 11. She has four American siblings and a mother who are desperate to hear news from her. But she has managed to conceal this double life from her publishers, her agent, lawyers in several continents, the Australian Department of Immigration and, until now, the public.Some of the other reviewers might want to take a look at a book called Orientalism by Edward W. Said.See also: Her life as a fake: bestseller's lies exposed.Literary Editor Malcolm Knox uncovers Australia's latest hoax author.Sydney Morning Heraldhttp://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/23/1090464854793.html?oneclick=true"
1,Poor Taste,"I forced myself through this book because I thought I was reading a true story about an important cause. I forgave what I thought was a poorly written book because I believed that the author was sharing an important story, even if she didn't know how to write it well. And then I found out that the author is a fake and grew up in Chicago. There is nothing wrong with researching a topic you have not experienced and sharing it with the world, but at least do the research well and write the truth. Don't try to glorify yourself with someone else's tragic story. Honor killings are a real problem that should be investigated and addressed, but Norma Khouri is just trying to profit off of other peoples tragedy. Do NOT read this book."
5,A Jordanian woman telling her story of friendship and love,"This book touched my heart. Norma Khouri chronicled her friendship in modern day Jordan. I believe it is a powerful book because it is informative and well written for all people, including teenagers. The best way to fight for human rights is to inform the masses and this book can. This is true honor, a woman honoring her friend."
4,A real eye-opener.,"This book not only made me sympathize with the plight of women throughout the world but it also made me appreciate being a woman in America. Though we still have many barriers to overcome in a male-dominated society, this book was a real eye-opener as to how woman are treated in countries that are driven by male dominance.Honor Lost has made me aware of a crime that I had no idea exists in modern times. Honor killings should be considered a felony and should be protested by free women over the would. I cannot imagine how difficult it must be for generations of women to be continually persecuted in the name of honor and religion. Khouri's explanation of the fear and humiliation young women of Jordan face under the thumb of the father brings the face of deception in this ""free"" country to light and brings the definition of freedom to question. How can we let this tragedy continue?"
5,Deeply Touched,"I found this book to be a compelling and touching story of love.The auther did a wonderful job in paying tribute to a friend, a sister, who dared to dream and follow it through knowing that it would cost her life.I was deeply saddened by the death that Dalia suffered at the hands of her own family.I believe that Norma has conveyed the story as it happens in ""Modern Day"" Jordan.And I congratulate her on accomplishing this work of literary art.This is a great way for her to speak out and make people aware of Honor Killings against woman in Jordan, especially since the woman in Jordan don't have the opportunity to stand up and defend themselves."
1,"Watch Documentary ""Honor Lie$"" first- skip this book","This book is complete farse. Born and raised in California, I lived in Jordan from 2004-2006 while serving in the Peace Corps. I read this book when it came out while I was in jordan and, while well written, is fiction. After seeing the documentary ""Honor Lie$"" (you can find it on youtube) I ordered the book ""murder in the name of Honor"" by Rana Husseini! Husseini is much more educated on the subject so if you want a book on this topic, pick that one up and SKIP the fiction in Honor Lost"
4,all my favorite fairy tails,"these are worth reading for all generations. Especially this new one being raised on video games , facebook and the internet"
3,"Seller is great, game is a disappointment","I want to send kudos to the seller. I got what I ordered and in an extremely timely manner. I wanted this game specifically to play the Coeur d'Alene course. I was sorely disappointed to find that the pc version of the game doesn't contain that particular course. I understand presenting variety, but I would be willing to bet all of the game console versions had that course. In some instances, it just doesn't pay to get out of bed in the morning."
1,BUGGY!!!!!,"First, let me start off by saying that I am no computer dummy. I have been around computers for over 20 years. It's safe to say that I know what I am doing. Secondly, I have a very high-end, very powerful gaming computer, on which I have played many large and complicated games. I have never had one freeze up on me, EVER! This game freezes up at least 75% of the time. I choose a game mode, and when I go to tee off, it freezes on the loading screen. It has nothing to do with my graphics card, because I am able to practice and I have managed to play a few amateur games. However, I am now stuck, because everything that involves making money that I try to do causes the game to freeze. TW 2004 NEVER did this on my computer, and I loved that game. This game is great, when I can play it, but EA really didn't work out the kinks on this. Shame on them."
3,Pretty much the same as 2004 version,"My first experience with Tiger Woods golf was the 2004 edition.After years of playing Links and getting bored with the series,I gave Tiger a shot.I loved having to work my way up to a pro,the courses that had to be conquered ( except the silly fantasy courses that are just plain unfair )and earning $$$ to buy new equipment.The new edition is more of the same ( even the same announcers with the same old comments )few new featues that I have not even got into yet.Maybe I'll come back and write a better review but I'll tell you guys I'd wait until its $20 cheaper or until they revamp the game in a couple years.I love this game and really enjoy it but I wondered why nobody had written a review.EA spots may be falling into the same rut Links did a couple of years ago.Here's a better idea ask Santa to leave one under the tree and save your bucks."
1,Website Design and Computer Golf Games,"I am a website designer in Austin, Texas and have a company named Austex Websites. I spend a lot of time in front of the computer designing websites, so when it's time to relax I really enjoy computer golf. My favorite game is Tiger Woods 2004. The 2004 version allows the player to start as an amateur and work all the way up to the PGA tour, with extremely realistic settings, courses and players. As a real golfer, it's the closest I can get to the real thing. The 2005 version is just the opposite - cram packed with asanine character golfers, and with no appreciable improvement on any of the game play features of 2004 - a real waste of money. Knowing something about SEO (search engine optimization) and it's relationship to website design, I wonder if this review will dissuade people from buying the game."
1,avoid this one,"just say no to this particular installment of the inexplicably long-running series. both barely literate and in no way erotic (which really should be a prerequisite for erotica). the problem isn't that it's too weird, or too kinky (if only that were true). the problem? most of the writing doesn't quite compare with the mellifluous prose found in your average high school email.Most Implausible and Laughable Premise Prize for this volume: while there were many contenders, ""The Plow Pose,"" by Zaedryn Meade, wins, hands down - the bad sex, worse prose, and purple unmentionables make it the clear victor. ugh."
4,"Actually 4 1/2...Not ""perfect"", but what is?","PB&J; is not only a great sandwich, but is an outstanding Swedish act that makes ABBA and Ace of Base look like third graders in a recorder band. The sad thing for most other alleged ""artists"" out there is that the bonus disc (which I would refer to as B sides) alone is better than 99+% of the tripe that is passed off for as ""music"" nowadays.Just bought this album a few days ago and can't get the catchy melodies on it out of my head. Time to explore this group's back catalog...."
1,boring,"The ""bonus"" of a ""Bonus Track"" should not be skipping it to go to the next song. I bought this for the hit with hopes for more good music, but it was clear that WRITERS BLOCK prevented them from putting more than 2 good songs on the album. Zzzzzzzzzz."
1,The Music Is Bad!,"There is only one song on this entire CD that is worth listening to. There is one that all is, is this funky sounds. This was a poor purchase for me."
3,A disappointment,"I had high hopes for this album based on the single, ""Young Folks"" and the fact that it was an Amazon top ten album for 2007. I am dissapointed that none of the other songs sound anything like it. I know that often happens to artists, who sell a lot of records on the strength of one or two standout singles.The bottom line for me is that albums like this explain the proliferation of Itunes and Amazon mp3 sales. I usually like listening to a whole, cohesive album - (there are often so many great songs that don't get released as singles, and how will you ever hear them without buying the album?)- but in this case, I wanted to put ""Young Folks"" on repeat, and I quickly bored from that."
2,A Weird Offering,"This CD offers proof that a collection of music can be simultaneously catchy, intriguing, and absolutely awful! I found ""Young Folks"" to be engaging when I first heard it played somewhere in public, and bought the entire CD based upon that impression. The disc was listenable for a week or so until I finally concluded that it was awkward almost to the extent that I wiped all traces of it from my music collection. (It shares that distinction with only one other CD, Mark Mothersbaugh's ""Insomnia,"" from the late 1980's)If the primary lyricist(s) were to partner with a more capable musical ensemble, the results might be more worthwhile. Maybe. (And stop that damned whistling. It's not innovative. It's not refreshing. It blows!)"
3,Not bad,"These guys are okay and this album is pretty good. I wonder why it takes the public so long to pick up on things. These guys have been around for a very long time so it just goes to show that perseverance pays off...all you need is that one ""hip"" review and you could be on your way. Their earlier releases aren't so hot...think generic, unmemorable power-pop. This is a good starting point."
4,Great new band!,"If you heard one of their songs on the radio and are debating whether it's worth buying the album......it's worth it. There are 4-5 very good songs on this one. Which isn't a bad ratio these days. Amsterdam, Chills, Young Folks and Paris 2004 among them."
1,Unlistenable Garbage,"This band is bad in a way that's hard to describe. In the indie world, there's no real premium on really good musical chops, so it's not fair to say that they're not really very good musicians -- though they aren't -- their problems are much deeper.Their songs are poorly formed, weakly presented, and seemingly without motive. It's not even like listening to a high-school band. It's like listening to a rehearsal by a band that hopes to be able to play for a middle school dance, if they can just figure out a cool name.This is a band with nothing to say that should learn not to say it."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"This music is the lowest common denominator of the indie-pop scene just like Nickelback is the lowest common denominator of the modern rock scene. Stupid keyboard effects, boyish processed vocals that barely qualify as singing, limp-wristed monotonous guitar strumming like Coldplay, drum parts limited to 2 or 3 second loops, minor key quasi-melodies. If you're generally ambivalent to creative use of rhythm, harmony and melody and only hear the bohemian chic in the timbres this album will be a valueable fashion statement to add to your wardrobe. Recent stylistically similar albums with more musical substance incluce Postastatic's Be Still Please and Math And Physics Club's Self-titled."
1,I seriously don't get it...,"I don't understand the praise this album is getting. I have no idea why ""young folks"" gets played so often on the radio. I can't stand that song. I got the album, not having heard even one bad thing about it, and I honestly do not hear anything redeeming with this group. People tell me that they get a nostalgic feeling while listening to this, but I don't see it. I've wanted to ask people ""what do you see in these guys? why do you like this?!?"" but I don't want to be rude. But seriously, why is this so popular?"
2,Very Spotty Album,"Heard a lot of the songs off this album on Pandora, thought I'd go for the whole thing. After listening to it all the way through I think I could have bought a few of the songs and left the rest.I'd encourage anyone considering this to use the song previews to their advantage."
4,very interesting book.,"This is a good book to read. It contain basic introduction to microwave integrated circuit such as Smith chart, S-parameter, impedance matching,passive components and detail about tranceiver building block such as mixers,amplifiers, low noise amplifier, oscillator, etc. I think their are some part of this book duplicate with recent textbook of the same author.This book do not contain any exercises and do not cover the architectures of transceiver. (e.g, the missing block between rf power amplifier and microstrip antenna or base station transmitter attenna)Eventhough, I don't finish reading this book. I recommend this book can be benifited by customer!"
5,Revealing and inspiring look at what it means to parent a disabled child,"I've just listened to Mary Beth and Megan on the Diane Rehm Show and was very moved by their openness in describing their sons with Fragile X and their life with them, how they parent these sons, searched for the best education and medical care for them, and how they have found meaning and joy in their sons, despite their severe disabilities. Their book is an inspiration to all parents with disabled children."
3,Bought For My Wife,"I did not read this, but my wife did. While she appreciated some of the sentiments expressed, she was less than enamored with the book as a whole.One of the ""problems"" with most - but certainly not all - books like this in my opinion is that in many cases they are written by parents who have far more access to academic and medical resources than the ""typical"" parents of a special needs child. The ""average"" special needs parent does not have the money, time, or education to write a book of this nature, nor do they have the financial ability to travel all over the country visiting with the top medical specialists in the field, or attending all the latest seminars and conferences. That is not a good or bad thing; it is just the way it is."
4,All-American Pin-up art,"Set in a scrapbook-type format, this book showcases pin-up art used to help G.I.'s show exactly what they were fighting for back during the World Wars.Plane Nose Art, Calenders and matchbook covers are some of the pieces showcased in this book. Everyone from Vargas to Elvgren's artworks are shown in a small sampling, that'll help entice you to look them up further.Great racy art (considering it's been decades since they were made) of an era long gone. These pieces are definitely a 'less-is-more' situation where what you don't see is sexier than what you do."
2,The introduction is the best part!,"The introduction to this book is an informative piece about various pin-up artists of the WWII era; however, most of the book was a scrapbook style work that left much to be desired. The main fault with the display of images was that there was no way to tell which artists created which images. Another drawback was how ""racy"" some of the images were. This significantly limits the appropraite audience for this book."
4,Ordered two CD's,"I must say I was pleased with the ease and extremely fair price of the CD's. They were delivered in a timely manner, but took longer than my last order. The only problem I have been having is that the plastic box gets cracked in shipping. Maybe they should use a CD cardboard box specifically made for shipping CD,s instead of a padded envelope."
3,Decent Remaster of great 60s guitar classics,"Magic Records of France has done a decent job remastering songs from their ""In Spain"" LP and various singles and EPs from around 1963. This disk and other Magic comps of the Spotnicks may currently be the best way to get ahold of their stuff. The import price is reasonable for the amount of music you get. Bonus tracks are quite a treat!The songs are great, both instrumentals (the best of the bunch) and vocal tracks as well.However, I feel Magic may have went overboard on the remaster process. The song files are highly compressed and it sounds almost too bright in spots. Yes this is the sound of the Spotnicks, but I find the Swedisc releases of the original albums on CD are a better way to go if you can find them.Other than that, this CD is a good deal if the Swedisc versions can't be found."
2,Seems dated,"My opinion may be a little biased, because my copy had no soundtrack and was covered in static from a really bad dupe (it's going back to Amazon tomorrow), but it seemed long on the people shots (circa 10 and 20 years ago) and short on scenery. I managed to hear a little bit of the narration taken from the Bunnell book, and there didn't seem to be any indication that ""Dr."" Bunnell's book, written decades after the fact during a boom in Yosemite's reputation, is considered to be somewhat bogus--but it's dramatic, so what the hey? For the unvarnished history of the valley (such as the fact that it was a mosquito-invested wall-to-wall swamp when it was discovered), I'd recommended picking up a few of the available books; for scenery, there's got to be something better than this."
4,A nice Teen-Parent help book.,"This was a real nice book that helped parents of teens understand what they like to do and where they like to ""hang out"" You should get this book because you and your teen will have guarenteed more wholesome time resulting in a better relationshop with your teen. Thank You.:)"
5,It worked for me.. Problem where do we get it now?,"For 3 years now my dog has been suffering with a skin condition (yeast/bacteria). I have went to at least 5 different vets and have tried many many different treatments and have used various kinds of shampoos. I used this twice a week for about 3 weeks and this seemed to be the only one that was FINALLY clearing up my dogs skin unfortunetly I didnt order enough, My dog weighs 145 pounds he is Newfoundland and very big so I used most of the shampoo after 2 baths. Since then I have tried finding this shampoo again and CANNOT find it anywhere. Does any one know where it can be found or when it will be available again... otherwise its back to the drawing board for me."
3,Acurite timer,"This is a good product, replaces a previous model sold under the label Galleon. The package is identical. Unfortunately, there are two differences in the product.First, the Acurite timer does NOT have an on-off switch. There is an indent in back where the on-off switch is located on the Galleon timer, but is it filled in with plastic. So, carrying the timer is not feasible.Second, the screen is of lower quality and can not be read unless one is almost directly in front of it and at the same level as the timer.Not sure why Galleon stopped making timers. Not sure why the replacement is made more cheaply. Too bad."
5,Just Buy It,"this game is probaly the best game out on gba. it has awsome graphics and has a very good story involved. i think this game is less confusing than advanced wars 1 or 2. if your lookin for a good rpg, get this game. i haven't played fire emblem because i still play this game all the time. this game has many of the same features as fire emblem just you come back to life unless you're on certain levels. this game should get 5 stars because of the graphics and all around game play."
4,Pretty good,I've been playing this game for about 2 months now and I still have 130 missions left because there's 300 missions in the game!Which is ok but REEAAALLLLLLLYYY LOOOOONNG.Also its a little hard managing all you charaters and sometimes you'll want more than 24 people on your team so you'll need to choose which jobs you want carefully. there's more than 35 out there. overall this game is pretty.
2,I couldn't get into this game,"I am a huge fan of the Final Fantasy series and I thoroughly enjoyed Final Fantasy Tactics for the PlayStation. This game, however, I didn't care for much. The sound and graphics were decent, but the playability was way down. In the original, you were able to rotate the camera angle to get a better view; that feature doesn't exist in this version (I suppose due to the restricted available memory). For some reason, game designers seem to think that more complicaated means more challenging. The whole 'law' system I think is a big downfall. You can make a game challenging without making complicated game mechanics."
3,It came in a manila envelope.,"It did NOT come in it's original box, just the game card. Of course, the game cartridge still was in tact as these things are fairly durable. Still, the manual was also absent.Regardless, the game play experience was not hindered by it's lack of proper packaging/information."
3,My review,"I guess to begin with I am a fan of the original Final Fantasy Tactics, thats why I picked up this game. Over all the game play was good , it has a great system to it and you can easily sit there for hours playing it, but the story line is so incredibly terrible that I'd have to say I would never have even continued playing it if I wasnt a fan of the original Final Fantasy Tactics. I really cannot emphasize how incredibly terrible the story line is, mabey if I were a 12 year old it would be alright. Either way other than the story its good to go, and pretty inexpencive as well. If you liked the first FF Tactics I'd suggest giving it a try."
5,My first Final Fantasy,I love this game I mean it's so hot. It's fairly challenging. In the beginning it's weird and somewhat difficult to understand in the beginning. But the game is fairly priced and fun and for people who know final fantasy you get healed between battles. This game is pretty good if I cursed there would be a lot of words positive ones describing this game.
4,Amazing,"If you like final fantasy, you won't want to miss this. The fights take 10-20 mins each, but you can save at any time. The manual is a bit vague... just remember to hit start during a battle to save and nullify laws.... bottom line, buy it, even if you don't know anything about final fantasy."
3,it should be a great game but...,"Alright, I admit it, I just can't find a single reason why this game isn't fun. The law system, it's great. The mission system...there are a little too many, but overall it's pretty good. the overall battle system sort of resembles Tactics Ogre and FF9 combined, and it's pretty good. The graphics are good, the story is pretty good, even though it moves quite slowly...there's just one flaw. I just don't have FUN playing the game. it's like a chore. Somehow, in all the good-great-ness, I'm not having fun, which is why I only gave it a 3-star rating. Maybe you'll have fun with this game...as for me, I'm sick of it."
4,An Amazing Game that can be extremley hard at times.,"I found this an amazing game. I don't own it, but was introduced to it by a friend. It is aewsome, but it can be really hard at times. I am serosiually thinking about buying it."
4,Final Fantasy - Tactics,I have a lot of fun with game. It is challenging but not frustrating. I can play this game and not get bored. I really like Final Fantasy - Tactics.
1,If this is what the FF series is all about...count me out,"I bought this as my first official Final Fantasy game...however, I was very disappointed. I mean the graphics and sound were excellent but all you do is battle! You can't even explore lands...you don't even get to actually control the character except to battle and to go places on this ""overview map"". I am a die hard RPG fan and let me say this game puts to shame the big hype everyone expected...and degrades the true meaning and reputation of the RPG world."
3,Final Fantasy Tactics is EXTREMELY boring!,"I had purchased this game only because I had remembered playing a Final Fantasy game on the Playstation years ago. I had never caught the name of the Playstaion game, so I had immeadiatley assumed that this was the one. I had played this game for six days and completed it. Its really boring, but I guess its something to do when you don't have anything else to play with."
1,THIS IS NO FFT !!!,I'm a true fan of FFT FOR PLAYSTATION! I baught FFTA believing that it would be more developed story wise and game play than FFT! I couldn't even play it for an hour! WHAT HAPPEN TO MY DEAR FFT!? Thats the last time I rush to a store for a game! BUY this game if you like kiddy games! I think I'll resale my!
5,"Great game, Great price",Great game for a great price! Even after shipping this game is still $10 cheaper than the retail price I see in stores. Go ahead and check out any GameStop or Electronics Bouttique or any other store that sells this game and I guarantee you won't find it cheaper. A+
4,Best gameboy game!,"This game is the best! I just got it last week and i'm addicted to it! It was almost impossible to get me off! If you want a great game, this is it! BUY FINAL FANTASY TACTICS ADVANCE!"
4,almost fun all the time...,"when i bought this game, i had high expectations, as my friends all owned it and recommended it to me strongly. and it was fun, extremely fun... for about two days. the strategy and job-based roleplaying was unique and exciting, and it was relatively easy to get a feel for the combat system. it kept me completely engrossed for hours. however, after the first twenty or so battles, the whole things starts to feel repetitive, and the missions become somewhat monotonous. this is not helped by the less than interesting storyline. i would recommend this game to anyone, but these are just my words of caution."
4,Cute Graphics...Addictive Gameplay,"Don't be mislead by the cute graphics. Remember Advance wars, how simple they were, yet the gameplay was unbelieveable. Same goes for this. The gameplay is great. The graphics, though 'cute' are pretty great, especially with the special effects like the magic and the summons. This game has got me addicted for hours trying to make an army of summoners, ninjas, alchemist and soo much. Everytime I see a random monster pop out, I chase it down and kill it for the AP Points. If you love strategy games and job classes, this is the game that will get you hooked for hours upon hours. Plus there is the linkup modes which will open up new missions and get you new weapons which you can't acheive during normal gameplay. GET IT NOW!"
2,Boring Game,"I was very disappointed with this game for several reasons. The biggest reason being that all you do is fight. If you like fight only in moderation, this game is not for you because it is all fighting. It takes forever to finish a battle, and it's hard to play and not fun when your characters are weak. I wasn't impressed with the storyline, and, as my first FF game, I expected much more from all the great things I've heard about FF. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think this game was worth the money."
5,"Mesmerizing,, soulful","One of the best i have ever heard! mesmerizing music, soulful lyrics, soothing rhythm. Wish there would be more like album."
5,I Bought it in 1977,"I first bought this album in 1977 amidst all the Marley mania and thought it was ( I now know it was ) head and shoulders above everything else on the market at the time, it was and still is Pete Kane"
4,Excellent when purchased from The Sprout House,"I purchased mine fro The Sprout House. Theirs came in a plastic jar (similar to a spice jar). I sprouted them in an Easy Sprouter. It really was easy. 100% of them sprouted and all very close (time-wise) together. I only give them 4 stars because 1 lb does not last long, and I personally did not find these nearly as tasty as seed sprouts.I would recommend that readers be very careful about the reviews they read because I don't believe the products are the same from different sellers. In a separate purchase, I was shockingly dissatisfied with a purchase from Buy Wholesale Cheap whose seeds came packaged in a ZipLoc bag which leaked seeds all over."
3,Not the best mix for me,"It seems like the three legumes all sprout and grow at different rates so the texture is a bit uneven. Also, the peas and garbanzos are such large seeds that they take a long time to use up their stored energy. You are either eating a lot of seed or you are eating overgrown sprouts. I'd stick to the lentils on their own or to the always classic mung."
3,Grow Organic seeds,"organic sprouting seedsI tried once to grow the Garbanzo, green pea, lentil mix, but was unsuccesful. The mixture started to get moldy after 2 days. It maybe due to the recent hot weather we have here. I think there should have been more detail instructions on how to avoid mold.- SAM"
3,"Mixed sprouts, mixed results","Overall a nice blend, but given the different sizes of the seeds, the sprouting ratio was a bit mixed. Taste was good, might prefer the seeds not in a blend, which is what I will try the next time I buy seeds. Used them with the sprout house and it worked well."
5,Gotta have it,"If you enjoy Good Gospel Music & buying a CD where every song is a blessing then I would strongly suggest ""Welcome to the City"". I have never Purchased a CD where I enjoyed Every Song until now. This Choir is truly anointed. God Bless."
2,Shockingly Garbage,"This Trainer collar works, but not well on our dog. Maybe its because we have a Mastiff. She barks right through it. I have turned it all the way up and it doesnt really bother her. If you have a big dog I would try something diffrent"
2,Don't waste your time,"I'm amazed that Hollywood hasn't already made a movie out of this. Its gratuitous violence is right up their alley. Sort of ""Clockwork Orange on Mars."" Except most of the violence takes place on Earth. The only saving grace, I thought until near the end, was the possibility that the anti-hero only had mistakenly thought that he raped and hung all those sorority girls or made that poor mother-of-two eat his handgun before pulling the trigger. At least he felt guilty about it. Then he choked a doctor to death for the doc's boarding pass, and I realized, yup, he probably did the other things, too. So why did I finish it? I think to find out how bad it could really be. Well, it didn't get any worse. There was that. The writing was okay, almost compelling. But, in the end, I realized that I had wasted my time and money. Nevertheless, I like much of Barnes's work, especiallyThe Sky So Big and Black. Buy it instead."
1,"""Mother of Storms"" it Ain't!","Disappointed doesn't even come close to my feelings about ""Kaleidoscope Century"" after having read it. Disgusted and horrified come closer. The book is fairly well-written with an interesting view of the future (which saved the book from a 1 rating). However, its main character is an unrepentant bad, amoral, and possiby evil human being. Barnes could have salvaged the book by having the protagonist recognize his mistakes and try to correct them when given a chance. Though it appears that that was where the book was heading, it wasn't.Sure, maybe it's just a personal opinion. But, I don't need to become immersed in the point of view of an amoral person and have that mind-set and his actions rattling around in my skull. Perhaps humanity is essentially bad or evil (which seems to be the implication). Though if it is, I don't want to be a participant via a book as the protagonist."
1,KaleiDULLscope Century,"I didn't care for this book. Lots of concepts are introduced which could have been explored in more detail and explained better by Barnes. Confusing, because of continual shifts from present to the past. Protagonist is an unlikeable and despicable character. He is a murderer, rapist and a pervert and has little remorse for his actions.This is the only book I have read by Barnes. I probably will not buy another written by him."
5,A masterpiece -- but a bummer,"This is a tour de force in every way; a consistent and sensible future-world, interesting action, and characters who hold your interest. But there's the problem (it's not a flaw, because Barnes did it on purpose). The characters are so damned repulsive that by the end of the book you feel unclean. Ugh. And it doesn't help that, in a wholly unadmirable way, it's at core a love story. It's truly a masterpiece in terms of craft, but it's not beach reading. At least, not if you want to enjoy the beach."
1,"depraved violence, no redeeming qualities","I hated this book. I have a large collection of F&SF, and after reading this book to the end -- hoping for it to get better all along -- I threw it away, because I would not want to inflict this on anyone else.I've enjoyed other books by this author, and enjoyed them, so it is Barnes's choices in anti-hero characterization and plotting that I can't stand in this book."
2,Too pricey for unimaginative book,"CONDUCTING THE REFERENCE INTERVIEW isn't a bad book, but it's basically 280-some pages on how not to be a jerk. There wouldn't be anything inherently wrong about this except the book was quite expensive. I sort of think my graduate school was a little short-sighted in requiring this. I could've learned just as much by reading a journal article."
3,Surprisingly good,"Well here's a first, a tribute album with songs performed entirely on guitar including the vocals. Wait, it's not as bland as you think.Lloyd does a remarkable job of getting the tone of Brian May's guitar just right, giving an accurate Queen ""feel"" to the tracks.You don't quite miss Mercury's singing as Lloyd also gets every vocal inflection from his guitar. This album is a perfect karaoke CD. It's pacing is perfect and you naturally sing along with the music.The only real negative is the use of drum machines. If you're going to do an album of songs entirely with instruments, use REAL ones. A real, heavy drum sound would've worked wonders for this album and I could've easily given it an extra star on that alone.This album could've easily gone bad fast but Lloyd put a lot of work into this, getting every note *just* right. Even Brian May was sceptical at first but changed his mind upon listening to it, calling the CD ""..a fine compliment indeed!"""
3,Too much aftertaste,"We eat mostly gluten free as one of my kids has a sensitivity to it. While I try to bake all the goods myself, these looked like a good thing to carry as a snack when we travel. My daughter didn't like the cookie part much. SHe kept trying to pick out just the chocolate chips.For myself, it was OK. Sometimes gluten free baked goods can have a grainy aftertaste and that was the case with these. The upshot was they make an excellent cookie crumb pie crust when you toss them in the food processor and grind them up."
4,Very Good Organic Gluten-Free Cookies,"I got sent a sample of these organic cookies from the manufacturer and really enjoyed them, so I signed up to get an ongoing monthly delivery of 6 boxes. The problem is, I eat them all within a week so I think I need a second delivery for two weeks later. :) The cookies are crumbly and taste a bit like Mexican Wedding cookies. One thing though, the cookies can come crumbled a bit at times from shipping and the size and amount of chocolate chunks vary greatly from one cookie to the next. I found that is okay though, because they are so tasty. I like dipping them in organic rice milk."
2,Save your $ - buy these in the store.,These cookies are pretty good for gluten free (but very high in calories). But do yourself a favor and don't buy them online. They arrived as a box of cookie crumble; every single cookie was broken.
4,gluten-free cookies,"I love these cookies. They are a great gluten-free treat. They are a smigeon dry, so you'll need to have some milk handy."
2,just ok - most broken,"Cookies a little too sweet for me. The cookes came delivered in unbroken boxes, but found most cookies inside were broken and just crumbs. I liked the chocolate chip ones better- they were not as broken as these pecan shortbread ones."
3,"cookies: shortbread, choc. pecan",its nice to have them individually wrapped. the taste is ok but a little chemical taste in the parts without chocolate chunks. each individual would have to try for themselves. they will keep easily due to individual wrapping.
2,disappointed by the condition,"I was thoroughly disappointed in the condition of the cookies after they arrived. I receieved the Chocolate Chunk,Choc. Chip and Pecan Choc. Chip. They arrived in two shipments and all were broken. Only a few of the Choc. Chip cookies survived.Hey Amazon, I think that the packing wasn't sufficient and it might have helped to mark the outer boxes ""fragile""."
1,Power of Marketing!,"The power of marketing behind Mrs. Souza is incredible! Her previous album, Brazilian Duos, was listed among the Best Jazz Albums of 2001 by New York Times - a critic, Mr. Ben Ratliff, had received an advance CD copy and included the album on his list, although the album only would be officially released in April 2002...Strange? Well, the next year the same Mr. Ratliff, in the same NY Times, included the same CD in his Best Jazz Albums of 2002 list...Then, ""Brazilian Duos"" got a Grammy nomination in March 2003...And now, in a few days, this horrible ""North and South"" CD will receive a Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Vocal Album...No more comments."
1,Simply disappointing,"It takes a lot to sing a classic song like Chega de Saudade and turn it into a lifeless, boring ballad. Chega has been one of Antonio Carlos Jobim's most successful and popular compositions. Her interpretation not only doesn't do justice to the song, but also is an insult to the memory of the great Brazilian composer who enriched our lives with such classics as Desafinado, One Note Samba and Insensatez, to name just a few."
1,Boring and very disappointing,"A very disappointing album, very boring arrangements. This singer cannot be compared to Astrud nor Flora. Luciana has no charm, she doesn't swings, the whole project is a disaster. The pretentious version of Chega de Saudade is ridiculous!"
4,Descriptive lives of Gnomes and Halflings,"I recommend this for anyone who wants to develop a character of these races. The book gives knowledge of who these characters can be portrayed as. I love it, and use it a lot in my campaigns. I recommend it for yours too."
5,Great product,Great product for the price. Great way to get my B vitamins every single day. A brand I trust too.
5,A LONG AWAITED PERSPECTIVE,"I have been seriously beading for three years,and i love the art. I'd tried using books on color from Designers outlook or quilters outlook,but as I started reading Ms Deeb's prespective on color in the realm of beading I knew I'd found what i'd been searching for. The explainations about the light as with the finishes of the beads and the effects that are achieved in designs ,will help me use the colors much more effective, because now I understand what I'm looking for when I'm choosing the colors in a project.Also, the tempo of the writing holds my attention. I hate to put it down. stephanie jordan,SRJ Designs"
4,Good information,"this book was a present for a friend, she says this is a nice book. She took some information to include on her projects."
2,not good,The book was not what I taught it was. I was really looking for a color wheel guide to beading. This book did not meet those requirements.
1,Sooooo disappointed!,"I am so disappointed. After hearing so many wonderful things about the Dyson, I broke down and bought a Dyson because my 1 year old has terrible asthma. Much to my dismay, it does not pick up pet hair on area rugs or persian rugs. When I put the Dyson on the ""carpet"" setting and vacuumed these certain areas, it made a horrible screaching sound that scared my son. When I put the it on the ""hard floor"" setting, there was no nose, but also no pet hair removal. Unfortunately, I will have to take it back :("
4,Right tool for the job...,"I have had my DC 14 for about 6 months now. As a middle-aged bachelor with few visitors to my home, cleaning my home ranks well below watching NFL football on the weekends. My home has a mix of berber carpet and hardwood floors. I have never spent this much money on any cleaning tool...My initial impressions were slight disappointment and reflected on the one and two star reviews I had read here. But, after six months, I can comfortable say this vacuum cleaner has become very intuitive and effective. Stairs, hardwood floors and dusty trim boards get the treatment easily.I would highly recommend this.The only improvement I would like to see is a little longer hose.UPDATE January 2013: I was surfing my other Amazon reviews. I still have this vacuum cleaner and it STILL works great. So happy with my purchase."
3,Good suction; terrible design for attachment use,"I just bought the Dyson DC14 and was so excited to use it. I, however, was quickly disappointed. First of all, it is heavy and hard to push/pull. And forget about using the extension with attachments! I thought i was going to pull a muscle trying to manuvuer that thing. It was horrible. I never could get used to it. It is a horrible design. I've thought about keeping it for the suction; just using it as a regular vacuum and buying the Digital slim for other use, but why should i have to buy two expensive vacuums to do what the one should do? Maybe that is what the Dyson engineers thought as well and purposefully designed it as such for that very reason."
4,"Great for carpets, so-so for hardwoods","Pros-lots of suction and as advertised, doesn't lose that suction-super long cord-great for cleaning carpets-good suction when running perpendicular to a wallCons-not great on hardwoods (can blow around pet hair)-wand is a little short and when using the vaccuum is a bit tippy-the base is too high to fit under most furniture"
3,Adequate,"The Dyson does in fact lose suction. The marketers are lying, which is a typical marketing ploy. That being said, is there really a great vacuum out in the market today? Help me out, as I have not found one."
1,"Low quality, poor performance on carpets","This upright has good suction but is not very good on carpets or anything else and is very chintzy build. This, along with the hideous design, makes me wonder why I ever bought a dyson. I'd love to find something that is designed to last a few years."
2,better buys out there,"My Kenmore upright whips the dyson on carpet. I vacuumed an area with the dyson, then went over the same area immediately with my Kenmore, and ended up with way more dirt in the cup. The Dyson's beater brush just doesn't seem to beat the carpet to remove the dirt like the Kenmore. I would modify the Dyson by strapping a heavy weight above the brush to push it into the carpet."
2,Never loses suction - because it doesn't have much from the start.,"My wife got one of these because of the hype but I'm the one who actually uses it. The thing has had terrible suction from the start. Yes, I have taken the thing apart and cleaned all the nooks and crannies.Also, the head unit is so tall it won't get under the cabinet bases in the kitchen. There is no foot lever to drop the handle back. You have to step on the head and pull it back.The hose wand gets stuck going back into the hose and the wand is unruly and tough to handle in tight quarters.I stopped using it and went back to my $75 Eureka."
1,Rug Beater / Rotator Cracked on mine too,"Taking it back tomorrow - had it less the 1 month and rotating beater started making load noise. Rotator was cracked / warped as described in other reviews. Used about 3 times just on small area rugs - so I would say it was lightly used. Based on the number of reviews with this issue, I will return it rather than replace and consider a different brand."
3,"Good suction, little pricey loud noise!","I had been debating getting a dyson for awhile. A special came up soI finally ordered. Total was $270.Pros, great suction, certainly picked up more then my old vacuum in a side by side test.Cons, kind of hard to get the attachments, and hose out. Also I bought this because we are in a rental home while having a home built. The carpet is older and thicker and the vacuum will make a loud noise because of the carpet length. I have read this is a common problem with this model. I have tried it at a neighbors with carpet that is not as thick and no noise.Overall a bit pricey. I say it works 25% better then my old vacuum and cost 5 times the price!"
1,It broke! Not worth it at any price....,"After a few uses, the beater bar started to make an incredibly loud sound which is supposed to mean the bar needs to be cleaned. Even after cleaning, we always have maybe five minutes of vacuuming until it makes that sound and shuts down again.... It works only if we use the bare floor setting without the beater bar.... Not worth it at any price...."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY - AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE,"I love innovation, and Dyson was all about improving on a mature, complacent market in vacuums. Our DC14 lasted for almost a year before the plastic parts began failing. Now its in the junk pile, a very expensive lesson in the high cost of poor execution. VERY upsetting to get burned like that, so thought I might save your dime. More recently I spoke to a cleaning woman about vacuum brands and recommendations -- she laughed when I mentioned Dyson (""only rich people waste money on those...""). Ouch.We've since gone through a Hoover. I am now purchasing a Miele S5 series. Let's hope it's my last."
2,"Nothing Special, bad racheting noise",There is nothing special about the cleaning performance. Was the same as our old Hoover Windtunnel. Product makes a terrible sounding racheting noise! Did some research and this is expected per manufacturer. It is terrible. Happens with any long carpeting or if you hit any furniture. Too expensive for this kind of performance.
1,Don't buy,"I am extremely disappointed in this product. Paid $400 about 3 years ago, and it has been a problem since day 1. The clutch assembly went bad and the roller assembly melted. Today got an estimate for repair for the latest problem and it was $250. I won't be repairing this piece of junk. I have a 45 year old Hoover that still cleans beautifully. Think twice before buying a Dyson."
4,"Dyson is great, but a little awkward","I love my dyson. It picks up everything wonderfully. My only complaint is with the telescope handle and hose. I fight with it all the time and pulled the vaccume over onto myself once, which was not pleasant."
1,Dyson d14,"Do not buy this vacuum! My friends and family call me ""Felix Unger""(yes, I'm 58 yr old guy ), because I am finicky about vacuuming , cleaning etc. My wife bought me this vacuum about a year ago, after I had used a Ricar for over 15 years, and a Hoover downstairs. I'd give my arm for the Ricar back, and the Hoover tops this piece of junk any day. After a frustrating year of bending over to swipe things into the direct path of the Dyson (cause it it ain't there, you won't pick it up) I just had to write to warn others. My God, it's edging capabilities are non-existent, and I find myself going over pieces of lint, crumbs, everything.... several times just to pick it up...By a $65 Hoover!"
1,A design nightmare,"After 6 months of use, I am looking to sell this piece of junk off on Craigslist. Here is why:1. Poor Maneuverability: the vacuum is large, heavy, and bulky2. Wand tool: it is grossly unwieldy and feels like you're wrestling with the vacuum when trying to use it3. Floor piece: it is simply built too high, so I can't vacuum under sofas and beds even on the edgesDespite its good suction and slick looking design, the utter lack of usability makes this Dyson a complete nightmare to use. Even if the machine wasn't on the more expensive end as far as vacuum cleaners go, I'd never buy another Dyson again."
5,Love this Vacuum,"I think it works great, it made my rug look so much better. IT works well on the hardwood. I didn't review it on a ten point scale or anything, but I think it is a great vacuum."
4,"Great Suction, but not quite perfect","I like this vacuum with only a couple of complaints. The suction is very good. It does a very good job with pet hair. It's great on carpet and bare floors. It is very well made and durable. I like the belt saving feature that ratchets if the beater brush gets locked on something. The cannister is easy to remove and dump. The downsides are: The on/off switch is located in a poor place, I am forever bumping it and turning the machine on and off when I don't intend to. The extension wand that stores in the handle is way to short, and you feel as if your on a short tether when trying to use it."
1,masking tape works better,Awful product. Doesn't even pick up loose dog hair or lint. Went back to Oreck.
1,Avoid - terrible product,"This is a terrible product. My wife and I bought this to replace an old Hoover we had. The Dyson seemed to work fine for the first few weeks, then it started making a terrible noise during use. It also takes a lot of adjusting to get it firmly on the floor, otherwise it doesn't work at all. It is also very cumbersome and awkward to use. The construction is a little cheap when you consider the price - it's made of somewhat flimsy plastic. We won't buy another Dyson."
3,owned one month,"I have had my dyson dc14 about one month now. It initially was difficult (removing the wand, etc) once you figured it out it was easy touse. I must complain that putting the wand back into position is difficult at times. It does not always want to go back in and you have to fool around with it. Often you hit the on/off switch which is close by and this is annoying. Also when you are emptying the bag or using the wand the attachments fall off the vacuum (poor design?). It initally seemed to clean really great. After about one month youhave to clean the intake valves which were full of dirt. Seems like a lot of maintenance which I did not need with my windtunnel. I will admit it is nice if you have hardwood floors as it seems to clean them well. However, for the money I don't think it is worth it.Does remove pet hair nicely from furniture and drapes."
1,One year later review.....lost suction big time!!,"Well I thought I would post my review now that I have been using it for a year. When you buy a vacuum of course they always work fine brand new which most of these reviews are. After one year of basic vacuuming, no dog or cat hair just around the house stuff the suction has been cut in almost half. The rollers have been cleaned, the canister etc...nothing helps. When I first got it I noticed it didnt really pick up fuzz balls or anything light that was really annoying, my hands were full of picking stuff up that the dyson wouldnt by the time I was done. The front is so high it doesnt go under my couch or bed, both of which are higher than normal. I am so dissappointed with the money I spent on this. I just retired it after only 12 months, it sits in the garage unused. I will never buy another dyson again. I couldnt wait to buy one only to be disappointed."
2,"OVERRATED, CLOGS FREQUENTLY","I don't know what the hype is. The machine is expensive, loud, heavy, and clogs frequently. We have to use the rotating brushes even on the hardwood floors, otherwise it isn't powerful enough to suck up dirt from the wood floors.It has been clogged so many times, and loses suction frequently. My panasonic canister sucks a lot better. I really wanted this machine to turn out to be as good as they claim. I think its an OK machine, but not worth the price or the hype."
1,not the greatest,"within a year of having this vacuum cleaner it needed repairs. It wasnt used often. It didn't really give a clean feeling when used on the hardwood floor. For the money and what they advertise i expected more. I think it may be worth to dish out a couple hundred dollars to get a nicer more expensive brand vacuum cleaner like sebo or Oreck. Its also a little high maintenance. the filters are kind of annoying to clean. Also when something gets stuck, it's not so easy to clean out. we are about to replace our dyson and we are not buying a dyson! my previous dirt devil worked just as well."
4,overall happy with the Dyson,I am quite happy with this Dyson. The only minor complaint I have is that the flexible extension is not as flexible as I would like especially when using it to reach under furniture. It does an excellent job of cleaning our rugs and hardwood floors.
3,"Beware the beater bar clutch, the weak link?","This is a decent vacuum when it works. Today the clutch went out for the second time in less than a year. When the clutch dies, the beater bar will not work. My DC14 is still under warranty, but I suggest that if you own one, you also have a 2nd vacuum cleaner for the times that it is in the shop."
2,I really dislike this vacuum,I have had this product for 3 years and still hate it. I routinely clean the filter and all the other stuff so that is not the problem. The Dyson does not pick up dirt worth a crap. If you are not holding the handle just right the suction is pathetic and even when doing it right I am not impressed. For $[...] I was really expecting something great and was completely dissapointed. I will never buy another dyson again.
5,Well Worth the Money,"I recently bought this vacuum at Costco. It is great! It manuevers very well, easy to push, feels lightweight as you push it. I agree with another reviewer, I don't know why you would need the ball model. It really does move well. It was very easy to assemble.- just a couple of snaps. The suction is great. I had a Hoover Wind Tunnel. I vacuumed with it the night before I got the DC14. I vacuumed the afternoon I got the Dyson (had to try it out!) Much to my horror, I ended up with about 3/4 a canister of dirt! Eew! I am a bit of an obsessive vacuumer - at least once or twice a day with my dog & 2 little ones. I couldn't believe that even with vacuuming as often as I do, I still picked up so much! YUCK! Great Vacuum. I would recommend it to anyone!"
4,happy with my purchase,"i got this may 2010 and have been very happy with my purchase. this is the best vacuum i've owned (which is only 3 total, so maybe thats not saying much). very good suction on this but i do have a couple gripes with this. one, i don't get why the crevice tool has a hole in the side of it. second, it seems like the wand doesn't get as good of suction as when running the floor part. i don't find emptying the canister a problem at all (though none in my house have allergy problems). it is amazing how much crap and hair and fuzz end up in the canister after vacuuming an area that was recently vacuumed. when we first got this we took turns using it in rooms that it hadn't been run in yet b/c it was so validating and cool to see how much crap got sucked up. i would purchase again."
3,Issue with this version but customer service good,"The clutch has broken twice within the first year. I believe it operates off of a separate motor? Customer service was very good in getting in fixed, once with a local repair place and once sending it back to the factory for repair. Since that time (last year or more,) it has performed well. Had I known then what I know now I would have purchased a different model that they sell. Since I'm writing this review so late after having purchased it I don't recall all the details but I believe there is a newer version that is more robust and has a single motor and so doesn't have the clutch breakage problems that this one has had."
2,Approach cautiously,"My vacuum was still under the 5 year warranty when the mini turbine head quit on me. I called Dyson directly, not to utilize my warranty but to BUY a replacement part. However, their service reps told me, on several different calls, that they had no record of me nor of my properly registered purchase, even while I sat at my computer looking at my online profile on their site with my purchase information. To blatantly lie to me was inexcusable.That being said, any vacuuming done with the hose part of the vacuum works quite well, although the mini turbine head is rather loud. The other part of the vacuum has never possessed much of any suction capability in its life, so the remainder of the vacuum is useless and therefore overpriced.This is my only Dyson purchase, and although initially I desired to purchase another, smaller style, after my experience with their fictitious warranty, I seriously doubt I shall do so again."
5,Dyson Wonder,"One of my first Dyson's, this Dyson has served the purpose.. and works beautifully!!(: Very pleased!! Great everything!! Easy to maintain!!((:"
2,"When you pay for a name, sometimes that is all you get!","My wife was bubbling over with joy when I relented and laid out big bucks for the Dyson DC-14. We got it home and she just couldn't compliment it enough. I on the other hand just finished vacuuming my office with it. It did an average job... But then I didn't pay 'average' money. I paid top shelf money.Mobility-average, speed-average, suction-slightly under average, construction average.Nothing about this says high quality other than the name. And I'm not sure about that.I followed the Dyson with the old Hoover and got all the stuff that the amazing Dyson left behind. Sad."
5,Great vacuum,"I should have bought this vacuum years ago. I have two inside dogs and have to vacuum daily. It's a breeze with this Dyson. It picks up like nothing I've had before, is very quiet and effortless to push around."
5,Best vacuum I have ever used.,"I was so tired of buying vacuum cleaners that would not clean my floors. Have finally found one that completely meets my expectations and then some. Wish I had made this purchase years ago. Believe me, it is worth the money!"
1,Beater Brush/ Rotator Cracked On Mine in Less Than 5 Minutes. TWICE!!!,"Read a lot of reviews and decided to take the plunge and spend the money on a DC 14. Went into Best Buy, and bought a ""demo/open box"" for $309. Returned home happy with my purchase and immediately started vacuuming. No Problems on the hard wood floors, I transitioned to the carpet and almost immediately heard a loud crackling sound from the brush housing. Looked and noticed it had cracked and warped at one side. Figuring this was the bad luck of a ""demo"", I returned to Best Buy, returned the ""demo"" and paid $399 for a new one. Returned home and returned to vacuuming. This one lasted all of 5 minutes before I heard the same dreadful crackling sound. Low and behold to my utter horror and dismay, the same piece had cracked once again! It is absolutely ridiculous that a vacuum at this price has such a pi## poor design.I would avoid this model like the plague."
3,Beware of the belt!,"I've enjoyed my Dyson for more than a year now. However, the belt broke recently, and this repair cannot be done on your own. It must be brought to a shop. Luckily, I'm still within the two-year warranty, so it was covered by Dyson. The repair shop told me that this is a common occurence with the Dysons and can be a somewhat costly repair. I noticed that they never talk about the durability of their belts in the product description."
1,Dyson's SUCKtion - lousy customer support,"I just got off the phone Dyson's customer service dept.--for the second time. I purchased my DC14 from Home Depot in 2008 (2 years ago). It came with a tag on it stating there was a 5 year Warranty. Recently one of the belts broke (of course the one inside that I can't get to). I called because I don't have the receipt and the first time I called them, they told me a Serial Number would suffice if I lost the receipt. The second time I called, I was told that the vacuum was made in 2006 according to the serial # and was no longer under warranty since in 2006 they only came with 2 Year Warranties (even though the tag on it said ""5 Year Warranty""). Basically I was told I was S-O-L and I would have to order parts and pay to have it fixed. Dyson needs to have better support if it's going to charge such outrageous prices for its products. I will NEVER by another Dyson product."
3,a little dissapointed,"I just recceived my DC 14. I expected very strong suction power. But I have to say, both my wife and I are quite dissapointed. It does not even pick up as much dirt as my previous $80 eurika bagless one. I did check that it was set for the carpet. I tried to find gear selection (high, medium, low, etc), but did not find any.Another annoying thing is: when you put it upright and turn it on, the suction power goes to the wand: You have to bend it to vacuum the carpet.Maybe I got a lemon one. But anyway, we are dissapointed with its suction power."
1,OVER-PRICED & OVER-RATED,"I hate this vacuum. I don't find that it really picks up or maintains suction better than any other vacuum. It's too light weight so when I detach the handle to use the hose feature I have to ""trap"" it between the chair and table so that it isn't constantly bumping into the back of my heels. The hose attachment is not well planned. The handle (that you'd use while upright) gets in the way when you are trying to reach into corners and the hose kinks, causing it to loose suction. It is very easy to empty the basket; which is the only good thing that I can say about it. I HATE HATE HATE THIS VACUUM!"
2,Pretty expensive for how long it lasts,"Bought a $550 Dyson three years ago, fair performance (though constant shocks when the beater brush engaged) since purchased but now the beater brush doesn't engage at all and is now useless at picking up anything. $550 for three years. I would have been cheaper to get a $79 cheapie every year, or even every six months.I can accept that we live in an era of disposability and cheapness so long as you're paying a cheap price. Dressing up a cheap product as something grand and charging half a grand for it and still be a piece of cheap plastic, well, fool me once, shame on me.....No more Dyson's for me......."
1,Terrible,"The light is about as bright as a bathroom nightlight...if that.Plus, it simply stopped working altogether after about a week.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1,Super Bright hype,"i bought this product to product my sisters new car. The lights arrived intact and working but, when they say Super bright. Yeah Right!. These lights couldn't light up a bathroom. Do not buy this product if you plan on using it for security. I eneded up just going to Home Depot spent the extra $20 and got lights that did the job."
1,Poor Item for retail sale,Product in Use in NJ. Save your money. This product is of no use to any consumer. It lasted 2 weeks and that was it.
4,Maxsa solar light,"Works well, has never failed or needed any service. The only issue is it is not as bright as I would like but it is sufficient by my front door"
4,perfect product,This product works perfectly.i did not expect it to last so long.it is still working as of the review date.
4,"Gredler Sums It Up, Minimizes Boredom","I was impressed with this book, Learning and Instruction: Theory Into Practice. I have just started my grad. degree in education, and used it for my first class. I found it to have rather concise and informative summaries of key educational theorists. The book, while structured chronologically, flows together nicely and shows how these theories build upon and interweave with one another. I am ordinarily not too thrilled, like many, about picking up a textbook; but I found this to be one of the better options. My only criticism is that it is pricy for such a small size."
3,Just read the Summaries,Each chapter has numerous summaries throughout and again at the end of each chapter. The material seems to repaet itself over and over. Read each summary and move on.
5,Moog is all I'll buy,"Moog parts are great. You can see the difference in quality between this and the OEM product. I think Moog also has a cheaper version...go with this one instead. The rubber on this is thick, and the overall quality of the parts are top notch."
2,nice controller but,"It has already malfunctioned. It seems they are making these too cheap, they just don't last long at all. It is definitely for small hands but I won't buy it again because of it being so cheaply made."
2,Reality check please..,"Somewhere near the front of the book, Mr. Neuman proudly discusses how he keeps his own marriage safe and sanctified by never doing more with a woman he encounters or works with than shaking her hand (and he avoids that if possible). No conversation, no friendship, no comradery. I thought his advice to do no more than shake the hands of your opposite-sex coworkers to be very unrealistic, with much of the rest of the advice. If the only way to ""save"" your marriage is to avoid 50% of the population & workforce, you and your marriage are WEAK!"
2,Get out your magnifying lens,"I have a passion for Niagara Falls; this passion took me to purchasing this book....it captures probably all the fine art imaginable about Niagara. The problem is one of volume. To print the art with a decent size, it would have been too large of a book and too expensive. Hence, they have taken to shrinking a lot of it. Alas, you have the art, but a lot of it is hard to see. Still, a worthwhile purchase for SERIOUS NFalls fans; if you prefer photos SKIP this book!"
3,hmmm...,"Listen to this CD, and you will instantly be entranced by Neighbourhood, Female of the Species, and You and Me vs. the World. These songs are indelibly catchy, and Scott's singing, weird as it is, does the job. Unfortunately, while it's obvious that there's loads of talent here, a lot of the songs are just plain boring. Some of them improve with repeated listenings, some do not. Lovechild of the Queen, Major Pager, and Kill Me are fairly irredemable. Still, the good songs are great, and make this well worth buying."
2,A handful of good singles...,"""Neighbourhood"" is a catchy song (very danceable), very vivid, but you definitely wouldn't want to live in a place like this! And you won't want to stay submerged in this album for too long. I am sure there are those who will disagree with me, and that is the power of personal opinion. We all have them. I just cannot get into this album. Apart from ""Neighbourhood"", the lush and charming ""Female of the Species"" (which has been treated to some overplay because of its inclusion on one of the Austin Powers' film soundtracks), and ""You and Me versus the World"" this album offers a lot of tired sameness and droning electronic parts. Personally I cannot listen to the whole album in one sitting because it grates on the nerves after a time."
4,Reviewed by author David Lucero,"As a person who appreciates and studies history, I have always been enthralled by the plot to kill Hitler. I've seen most documentaries of the July 20th Plot and was excited that David L. Wolper, a historian himself, produced this movie. I found it far better than the 2008 Valkyrie movie with Tom Cruise. I like Cruise, but found him ill-fitted for the role of Stauffenberg. I think Thomas Kretschmann would've done a better job (he played Major Ramer). This movie centered around how they devised the plan and was detailed in politically and historically correct views. The added necessary drama to keep the flow moving and I wish they would've shown how the plot unfolded, like what steps they used to take control of Berlin after the bomb went off in the Wolf's Lair. Still, it was far better than the recent film. You won't be disappointed. Brad Davis did an excellent job."
2,Lame and no sense of drama,David Wolper's full length TV feature revisted the subject of his Emmy winning Appointment with Destiny episode on the July plot but the result was far inferior to the original. Lots of historical inaccuracies and no drama. The viewer is not engaged with the characters. Definately movie of the week stuff.
4,Thrilling International Tale,A thrilling international tale filled with intriguing insights. Former journalist Carolyn Kvajic manages to bring a sensational story to life.
4,superkind is super kind!,"Superkind - a swiss band which did it! Originally from St. Gallen, Switzerland, they we're discovered bei the german record Company BMG Ariola in 1996. Their music is full of big electronic beats, loops, harmonies and even violins and noise, completed with german lyrics. So their sound is really worth to listen to, and not just because of the sexy female singer named Tau. Try it, you'll love it!"
1,Does not support a USB keyboard or a USB mouse,Imagine my surprise when I bought one of these and then found out that it won't support a USB keyboard or a USB mouse.If you read very carefully you might figure this out .
5,virgin salmon oil,"My opinion of this product is good. It doesn't seem to have a fishy aftertaste and I feel good after taking it, just one per day. Since the research also indicates this is a good product, I would recommend it. I'd say the secret is just one a day."
3,Hugo Boss watch Review,"The watch has ok quality, it appears the suggested price is over inflated, but the sale price(under $100.00) is reasonable. The watch is supposed to be water proof but the dye in the leather band runs when wet and colors your wrist black. once again not a bad deal at the reduced sale price."
4,cool and sophisticated,"I bought this watch a month back and iam very pleased with the overall product. Its beauty lies in its simplicity.great buy,the only flip side is its a little small(the dial is small).In short the watch is sexy and sleek."
3,basic power splitter to add 2 SATA devices to old Molex power connector,I bought it for stock and haven't used it except to test it. Functioned fine in the test. O K
5,Very handy cable !,"After buying a new pc, my old hard drive had the old power connection, so it would not fit. I bought this cable, and it works perfectly in the new pc !"
4,It Works,I have never used this type of adapter but my new pc requires another power point for additional drives.I was concerned more about my power supply than the adapter but since I was asked - works fine.
4,good product,the item worked exactly as i hoped.i needed this product to fix a new computer. this helpedthe wires were well made. i did nothave any difficulties getting it to work
4,Doe in rut,"I DOUBT this counts for much....but I stuck this bottle around my 3 Dobermans and they were crawling all over each other to get at it...snotting and drooling. Then I stuck it near my cats nose...and SHE made that growl face that big tigers make, tongue hanging out like they are about to sneeze. Then Later that week I dropped a few drops on each boot heel and went out scouting for deer in a public hunting area. Within An hour, 2 small 6 point bucks showed up and were sniffing around. But I also had some scrape drip scents going and they did drift toward those. Strange my dogs and cat acted this way....and the deer did show up but not certain it wasnt the scrape drips. But what is certain it does make some animals act real nosy so as far as it goes. well Im not shooting my dogs or cat....but it may work for coyotes as well as deer. I will indeed purchase more and use it in a group of scents."
2,"Good video, poor disc quality","These Families of the World videos are great, educational tools. However, they use poor materials and are overpriced. For only 2, 30 min. segments, $30 is ridiculous! New, professionally made movies are not that expensive! Taking advantage of educators like this is beyond belief. I own several of these and the material used to make them is very low grade. For this price you would expect better quality DVDs. My copy of Puerto Rico families was only played 2x. When I went to clean the disk it cracked down the middle. I looked at the back and the disk quality is that of a burned disk copy, not the professional grade you expect from a DVD purchase."
1,an ok game for kids under the age of ?,well ill be honest this game really is a very BAD game it is terible in fact GRAPHICS: 3 GAMEPLAY: 1 ALL AROUND CRAPINESS:10 this game is soooooooo sad that id say id rather makeout with that gay teletubbie than buy no even watch this game being played buy my 5 year old cousin. and i swear he would lose to that one pokeman that cant even attack that cocoon pokeman. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU DO YOU WILL BE BURNING IT 5 MINUTES AFTER YOU BUY IT.
1,Too cute n' cudly,"This game has no gore or violence or blood. This game is programming kid's minds to believe in misticaly evil creatures like 'jigglypuff'! The Asian's do know how to make great entertainment software, but this is know exception. I advise not to buy it ."
4,Poke Battle!!!!!!!!!!,This awesome. Even though it hasn't come out itwill be awesome. The pokemon com from GOLD SILVER RUBY AND SAPPHIRE.
4,Not untill March 8 2004,This will not release untill March 8 2004 acording to 8 web sites so we have to wait longer then we are surrposed to.
4,pokemon colleseum the best,Pokemon colleseum is the funest pokemon game on the planet. You go around catching shadow pokemon and purifying them and after you get them purifed then you raise there level. After you beat the story mode you can trade the pokemon that you catch in story mode to pokemon ruby. So if you have a gamecube and like pokemongames then get it it is a must for any pokemon fans. Two words GET [IT!!!!!.]
4,Great graphics and great Pokemon,"This game has some really nice graphics. The idea for the storyline is using dark Pokemon makes the game interesting. However, there is waaaaaayy too much battling and not enough adventure, just when you think you might actually be getting somewhere up pops another battle."
4,This game rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the best game ever.But before the rest of my review let's get one thing clear there are only 386 pokemon.Now then this game is awesome with the ability to snag and purify.This game is a must have for newcomers and pokemon veterans alike.Oh and before you go crazy about being able to catch all 386 pokemon don't because you can only catch 44 pokemon within the game I repeat within the game (except for when they evolve and Espeon and Umbreon who are the two you start with)the only way you could catch the rest of them is to trade between the other pokemon gameboy/gameboy color/gameboy advance games but you in the basement of the pokemoncenter in Phenac city.But you can only do that after you beat the game.If you want more tips just ask in your next review.
3,It's a pretty good game,"The game is pretty fun and decent, but it's kinda short and lame. Plus you have to use a gameboy to play 2-4 players. That's really dumb. Pokemon Colesseum is alright, but rent it first before buying it. Personally you should get Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness."
4,Finally,"Finally, they're coming out with a new stadium game. I've played pokemon stadium 1 and 2, and always wanted one for gamecube, and here it is. This one has all 391 pokemon, and you can compete in 2 on 2 battles. There is an RPG mode where you are a thief, and you go around capturing other trainers pokemon. then you can send these pokemon to the GBA and use them in Ruby and Sapphirre. That is the only non-cheating way to get old pokemon in to R/S. If you want to Know more, go to www.serebii.net(something like that)"
2,Pokemon Colosseum,Game is good but read the fine print - if you want to play more than one player you have to buy game boys and a gamepak. Bogus!!!
4,THE BEST GAME @THE MARKET!!!!,"Hi im here to review this game.The bonus disc is awsome i loved it,but is nothing compared to the real game.i can not wait to get it has everthing rpg,download pokemon from gba games.it is cool irecomand buying this game for any rpg or pokemon lover"
2,Buyer Beware,"While Colisseum's single player element is mildly entertaining, it's the multiplayer battle mode that has really disappointed me.Not only do you need the Colisseum game, but ALL human opponents will need to own a Game Boy Advance, a copy of Ruby or Sapphire with a saved game on it, and a link cable. There is no other way to play multiplayer.I can't believe the greed Nintendo is showing by forcing their customers to purchase all this unecessary hardware. A stand-alone multiplayer mode such as the one in Stadium for the N64 should've been included. I like GBA connectivity as an *option*, but not when it's forced down the consumers' throat. This is a spit in the face of their customer base, IMHO."
3,Things they forget to tell you...,"My boys were absolutely estatic over receiving this game at Christmas time, until they tried to play against each other.Please note that while the game does allow for multiple players to battle, it will NOT allow for them all to use the GameCube controller to do so. They only way to have more than one player in battle is to have a separate GameBoy Advance or SP, the required cable to hook these handhelds to the Cube, and one of the matching handheld games, Green, Ruby, Saphire, etc...Not much fun out of the box if you have one eager wanna be player waiting anxiously for their turn to play."
4,My favorite,I like this game because I like snagging other people's Pokemon. I like doing battles on Mount Battle. I like going on adventures in different places. It is my favorite game because it's fun doing the tasks in it.
4,I love this game,I like this game because of the pokemon and there powers. Another thing is the adventure and action.
3,IT'S ALL RIGHT,"This game isn't a big deal. For those pokemon fans out there i gotta tell you this is a little dissapointing. First of all the game is short. Also it has annoying challenges that were ment to be for gameboy only.Forexample, the thing with the trainers that you have to beat over and over until you reach the boss is more annoying in 3d than in gameboy. Also you can't catch wild pokemon only snagg pokemon from trainers. Maybe its just me but I sudgest you rent it first."
4,Best pokemon game you'll ever play!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Pokemon colosseum is a really good game. it really has evolved from that boring and yet easy pokemon stadium. there is a really cool story behind it! team snagem is creating shadow pokemon(their hearts are closed) they attack humans and go into this thing called rage mode.(hint) shadow pokemon are easy to purify by battling with them and calling their name if they go into rage mode.BUY THIS GAME!!!!(...)
4,DA BOMB,"This game is the best! I bought it thinking it is just another Pokemon Stadium with a fancy name but man I was wrong! This game has the best graphics! I got this game 5 days after I got my Gamecube and it is the first game I got, but it is the best! You are Wes, the hero and then you meet Anca, your sidekick. You mainly steal Pokemon from the bad guys, but it is alot of fun cause you have to battle with alot of Pokemon and purify all your Shadow Pokemon. There is alot more but I ain't telling you anything else! You have to figure it out yourself! GET THIS GAME!!!!!"
4,THE BEST POKEMON GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I give this game 5 stars beacuse all of my research points to this game is going to be the pokemon game of the centry. I pre-ordered the game HAHAHA!!! I hope the people who read this review reads my next review!!!later,pokemon lover"
4,THE BEST POKEMON GAME EVER!!!,I KNOW THIS GAME WILL BE GREAT.WITH THE ABILTY TO SNATCHIT MAKES IT MORE COOL AND YOU CAN UPLOAD POKEMON FROMRUBY AND SAPPHIRE AND DOWNLOAD FROM POKEMON COLLESEUM.IF YOUR BUYING YUGIOH WORLD CHAMPIONCHIP 2004 STOP!!!IT REALLY SUCKS INSTEAD RESERVE THIS I KNOW YOU WON'TREGRET IT.AND ONE MORE THING IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO GETDEOXY IN SAPPHIRE PLEASE WRITE IT ON YOUR NEXT REVIEW FORPOKEMON SAPPHIRE!!!
4,It looks great,Pokemon colosseum will be really cool i mean pokemon from ruby and sapphier its going to be so COOL! the best 3D pokemon game ever! mudkip rules!
4,Uh...What Happened To 'Gotta Catch Them All'?,"Griffinslayer: This Game is good. It has good music and the Pokemon were looking real... a little. But the only thing that's bad is you can't trade your team to the GameCube until you finished the game. I mean who's going to trade once you finshed the game? Well 1 good thing is that you can get your old Joto pals (except Lugia) to your gameboy advance and rasie them with your team but I still wanted them to improve the old 3D Pokemon (meaning if you play pokemon Stadium #'s 1 & 2, Houndoom, Pikachu,etc will look exacly the same no improvement). And to finsh it off, Salamence looks hot, Absol looks cool, and Banette looks scary 0-0. Not really important but I thought I mentioned that ^-^- GriffinSlayer"
1,not a good game,I bought this because i dont have a game boy and the old pokemon is so much better than the sinnoh trash and when i played it i found it just pressing buttons and if i could i would give it less than 1 star
5,Sweeet,"It is about time that a 3-D RPG came out for Pokemon. I have been waiting for this a long time. It seems like it will be a great game of everyone, old trainers and new. The only thing i find wrong with the game when reading the reviews and previews is that you cant catch Pokemon the old way. Hey im an old trainer and i like the old way of things. But it sounds like a great game and i already bought my copy."
1,Not Very Good At All....,"This game is not what I had expected. For one, the graphics suck, and to complete Pokemon Leaf Green/ Fire Red pokedex, you have to beat this game, which isnt an easy takt to be done. All in all, i dont reccomend this game."
2,Definitely not the best pokemon game,"This game kinda sucks because you don't really have a choice of what pokemon to catch. And when you do, you have to get there heart gage down(which takes forever) and then purify it. Yeah, the graphics are cool, but the storyline is weak. Don't waste too much money on this game. I would mark this off my Christmas or birthday list."
4,Not as good as I thought it would be....,"This game is so gay. I loved the old pokemon games, but this one just doesnt cut it. I had to go to buy a memory card just to play head to head on it. The story mode is dumb too. Who wants to start off with Espeon or Umbreon. They do that because their so weak until after level 36. Trust me on this, do not waste $50.00 on this. You would be better off just waiting until the price goes down because this game is not worth that much moola."
1,EWWWWWW! TERRIBLE!,"Ouch. Hopin 4 a good game. Good graphics. Fun. Yea Right. Like i got that. Terrible game play. Boring, hard to catch pokemon. Why would anybod want this game. The multi player is the worst. No 2 player w/o gameboy. Worst part is u got 2 use the pokemon to get all its moves. Don't buyit.If ur a die-hard pokemon fan, RENT FIRST. This game is a [...]. RENT FIRST. Beleive me. IM SAVING U MONEY!!!!!!40 BUCKS THAT U COULD USE 2 BUY SUMTHING BETTER. DO NOT BUY UNLESS U RENT IT AND LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! IM ONLY TRYING 2 SAVE U MONEY> HEAR ME OUT!![...]"
5,Colosseum Rocks!,"Colosseum is a great game. I haven't played any other Pokemon games but I do know that colosseum is the best. You do go through story mode pretty quickly, but it is very fun and exciting. It is a setback that you have to connect your and your friend's GBA to battle together. But in story mode you can purify some of the best shadow Pokemon to use in your Colosseum and Mt. Battle challenges. You must play it and get far to really enjoy it but it is worth it. It is a great game."
4,I don't know.....,"Well...I don't have the gamecube or the pokemon colosseum, but I go to my friends house to play this game every day...I must say, the attacks look cheaper then ever. Sure the graphics are great, good music, but you're character never talks!!! xD All the attacks are mixed up and stuff, so If you're a pokemon fan, don't buy this game. (lol) I would not reccomend this game to any game freaks or nintendo fans."
5,You Can Catch the Old Pokemon in this!,"When you attatch your gba to your gamecube, pokemon r/s is supposed to unlock an adventure mode that allows you to catch the oldies."
4,Hate it,I Hate this game! It sucks horribly! you cant play and battle your friends just by the contollers on the gamecube u have to go and buy a link and a gameboy advance and a game in order to battle your friends....it's just asking for more money and i wish i never bought it!
2,Better than sleeping pills,"In a word, Slow. Very slow. Especially the second half of the book. The excitement is missing. No real drama our tension. In fact, it may not even be as good as his effort with Rubicon, which was very slow, but st least had a modicum of tension and suspense (even though we knew the outcome.)"
3,A different kind of relationship story,"Majestic secret expands over 3 generations. Marjorie gives birth to Majestic. they live in a rural town in New York. At the tender age of 14, a bored Majestic meets a photographer, a white man and runs away to follow him to New Jersey. There she falls for his son Elgin, becomes pregnant and to that union comes Destiny. Majestic dies in childbirth and her mother Majorie comes and raises Destiny as her own. Through the book, we watch Destiny grow up. fall in love with someone from her mother's past, finds her father and other family members. Their lives intertwine and mingle as they move across country. If I tell you more, then I will give away the story so, I suggest you pick up a copy and discover Majestic secret for yourself."
3,"Not As Good As ""The Prey""","I read this author's second trilogy about a year ago and was so disturbed by it that I swore I'd never ready anything else by her. Out of desperation, I bought the Prison Break trilogy last month and enjoyed it much more, so decided to give this one a try.This installment wasn't nearly as good as ""The Prey,"" and I found myself not getting nearly as drawn into this one. The author is a good writer and a good storyteller, but it seems that she goes a bit too far and makes her books too dark and depressing for me to truly love them."
2,Not A Fan,"Normally I love a romatic thriller/mystery, however, I found that this book was too graphic and abrasive in the crimes. This is the first book I have read by this author and my dislike of the book could have something to do with the killer's absessive mutation of women. Spoiler: Rape and incest never turn me on to a book. The lack of humor to compensate for the violent depressing tone made me want to pick up a comedy just to get feeling good again. Reading this author, you can see her writing has a talented flair and gripping story, but I will not be buying another of her books. Maybe the others are different but I enjoy a little smile with my story. Just for reference of what I do like so you know my tastes: Lisa Jackson, Nora Roberts, James Petterson, Lisa Kleypas, Judith Mcnaught and some Jen Cruise."
3,It makes me feel happy inside,This is a great book. You will feel happy inside when you read it. Plus it's really good too.
5,Best Cryptic Book ever!,"I LOVE cryptic crossword puzzles, and this is the best book of them all! They don't come out too frequently here (as they do in the UK where they originated), and I am so glad I xeroxed the pages so I can do the puzzles in this book again and again! I have bought other cryptic books but this is by far the best! There are puzzles here by different enigmatists, and none are too difficult or too easy yet I find them challenging. Cryptics seem to be quite difficult when you are new to them, but don't give up--and you too will be hooked for life!"
5,Sweet as can be,"These valentines are made with heavier paper suitable for their ""punch-out"" format. I plan to use them as little add-ons in correspondence to my adult friends until they are gone. Then I plan to order another of these valentine books to enjoy during the next valentine holiday. They are a pleasant return to what was fun about grade school. A joyful visit to the child's heart in us all."
5,This was a Hit!,"Our 4 year old knew just which person was to receive each Valentine. This was such a refreshing change from the store puchases, and it is a great activity."
4,Retro Valentines - classic!,We were tired of the same old valentines so we bought these classic valentines. My 5th grader loved them! Lots of cut-outs and inserts that were interesting and sweet.
3,Cute Valentines Awful envelopes,"The valentines are cute, but I did not think the envelopes would survive mailing. I ended up using small envelopes I had to mail valentines to my grandchildren. It was very easy to punch out the valentines. The left over valentines I plan to let my grandchildren have the fun of punching out the valentines to give to friends in their Pre-K class.Vintage Valentines (Press Out Book)"
5,Just like when you were a kid!,"I used these to go on the tables for my wedding reception back last year in February. All the guests loved them and since we were an older couple, our friends that were our age, remembered them.....just like we did.It gave a really nice touch to the tables & guests were encouraged to take them home as an additional keepsake."
2,Many not very appropriate for children,"From the cover, I expected child friendly valentines; however, what I got --- many are too suggestive and not appropriate for little kids to give each other in general friendship."
3,Half are amazing,"I needed Valentine's for a just turned 3 year old preschool class (some of the kids are still 2) as a way of introducing them to Valentine's Day. So each kid would receive one card. There are 11 kids in class which is good bc only 11 cards were really big and vibrant enough to catch their attention. 5 of the cars came with extra pieces that were adorable but not suitable for this age group. But they were perfect for the 4 teachers in the class. The remaining 6 or so cards were small and folded. Ok, but nothing to be wowed over. Finally the last 4 or 5 cards were small and didnt fold. Not worth giving to a 3 year old in my opinion. I did make extra copies of the envelopes to have enough. They were easy to make and held together well with glue stick. I cant wait for the kids to open them, teachers too, but just know that there are WOW cards and then just ok cards. Definitely easy to punch out and put together, except the one with the big heart."
4,Excellent book for beginners in non-profit PR,I use this book to teach a beginning workshop in public relations for non-profit organizations as part of a continuing education program at a local community college. The book is an excellent resource for individuals who are not familar with public relations. It takes the reader through all of the things that he or she will need to do to effectively promote his or her organization.
2,very large pearls,"the earrings were pretty, but the pearl was much larger than shown. And, the pearl looked shiny and painted. I returned them."
4,"Lovely, but large","I bought these for my bridesmaids to wear for my wedding. At first I was displeased at the oversized pearls, however, the girls loved them and since they wore no jewelry on their necks the size turned out to be perfect. They all looked stunning!"
2,not great,"These are too big for a person my size to wear comfortably. I got the earings hoping to cut the stud off and wear them on a necklace, but they are still too big. Besides the size the color is a bit dull... about what you can expect for $30 pearls. I had them on my wishlist forever, right after I bought them at full price they went on sale :("
4,Sail with Columbus,"The voyage of Christopher Columbus, written as a journal by a ship's boy. Pedro was hired to ride with Columbus, not because he was a seaman, but because he could read and write. Details of the voyage are given from a boy's point of view, making them more interesting for 3rd-5th graders. The journal style gives a great feel for the adventures and discomforts of the voyage, and keeps a feeling of immediacy in this historical record."
2,Overall not worth buying,These dvd's are okay for beginners who really do not know anything about Salsa but for advanced dancers are a waste of money.At only 35 minutes per dvd they are not good value for money.The techniques these teachers perform in the first two dvd's are really bad. I have been reviewing Salsa dvd's & videos for over 12 years now & these two teachers are among the worst I have seen.This series is not recommended
5,Excellent set,This couple have come along fast to the top of salsa dancing.I have really learned something from each video that they have and i can't wait for what they have next in store for us.I believe they will do an even better job and will bring the passion of salsa everywhere they go.
5,Melodic Brutality,"Amazing blend of hardcore, grind, and metalcore with a flow of melodicy. DMIR really knows what their doing for their debut album. ""Shes tugging on my heart strings"" is one of the most brutal songs ive ever heard."
5,Super cute!,Cute little Cthulhu that every geek should own! Very durable material too. The wings actually have little wires in it so you can bend them out slightly. Great item to have on your desk or out on the DND table.
5,Great geek gift,"As my husband is a Lovecraft fan, I decided to buy him this plush for his birthday. The toy looks quite well-made, and is absolutely adorable. It's nicely squishable, and currently sits on his desk. This company did a good job on the plush."
5,Roman religion explained,Mary Beard does everything well in connection with her obvious passion for Roman History and this book is no exception. She and her colleagues have produced a book full of learning and insights into the beliefs and practices of so long ago
3,Needs English Subtitles,"Before you buy this DVD make certain about subtitles if you, like me, need English subs. The songs are really great but lack of subtitles diminishes the overall quality of the film for me."
4,Wide Ranging Work on the Power of the Subconscious,"I've read several of Dr. Murphy's books and it is clear that he was one of the great authorities on the power of the subconscious mind. My personal favorite is ""Telepsychics,"" but this book is a nice introduction to the benefits of controlling your own thought patterns. In today's society, everyone has ample opportunity to consider themselves victimized in some way. If you are tired of these types of defeatist thought patterns, read this book to learn a new way. Although the author utilizes many Biblical references, this is not a book that is exclusively for Christians. This philosophy is extremely inclusive. My only complaint is that some of the material is naturally a bit dated, since the book was originally published 40 years ago."
4,Good Material,"I like Murphy's message. Good mixture of anecdotes and discussion of subconscious cause and effect. His other book ""Power of your subconscious mind"" is my favorite however. Glad I got both for more solid reinforcement."
4,Miracle of Mind Dynamics,"An excellent book. Easy to read, and with very good subject matter that CAN make a difference to your life.I'm not saying you will believe everything that Murphy says -- but he gets you thinking. His perspective is interesting, a despite the time that Murphy's book has been around, it is like a ""breath of fresh air"".A better word might be renewal. Well worth a read."
5,This book has it all,"This is the best of Joesph Murphy's books that I've read so far.He tells you all you need to know about having the right attitude to life and how to heal yourself and others of every disesase and overcome every problem. Whatever you think is impressed on your subconscious mind - if you think positively, good things happen to you, if you think negative thoughts, you get ill or things go badly. It's that simple. It's always the nature of your thinking that determines the quality of your life. You're in charge!Murphy recounts innumerable examples of people healed and helped, and provides affirmative prayers for use in various situations.I particularly appreciate the summary provided at the end of each chapter.This book has it all, and I firmly recommend it to everyone open to change and the power of positive thought."
3,it's okay...,"But the author is way too enamoured with the still-living presidents' offspring he interviewed for the book and writes glowingly about them and their fathers, regardless of facts. He also inserts his own opinion too often, something that drives me crazy, but that is just a personal pet peeve of mine.The most interesting parts of the book are the stories of the earlier adminstrations and the children born to those presidents. The latter chapters are boring as are most of the modern-day presidents' offspring."
2,Semi-educational and an inch deep,"I'm reading this book, published in 2003, in late 2008 only because it's a 2009 selection for my book club. What a shame that is, because what a silly book this is.It's semi-educational, meaning that I trust the author got the names of the Presidents' children correct. But it's about an inch deep, meaning that the author's commitment to his thesis (the US Presidency is an immutably destructive force blunting the development of all but a few Presidential children) is too strong to be blunted by any facts that don't support it.The author, an active apologist for compassionate conservatism, the Bushes, and Amway, has fashioned a book that reads like this:1. Here's my theory.2. Here are the facts I've selected to support my theory.3. See how the facts I've selected prove my theory.Sheesh."
3,Interesting details,"Interesting details for purposes of camparison for those who have done other reading about the presidents and their families and a sort of quick informational format for those who have not. There is not a whole lot of deep-thinking required, and the book does provide entertainment and information."
1,Not good,"I was very eager to read this book because the subject is of particular interest to me. However, the book is either badly written or badly edited, or both, and the egregious errors of fact and language made it impossible for me to read."
2,Too many 'W's.,"The premise of this book was good. Wead did a nice job examining the presidential children throughout the years. He is correct in how many fall into common catagories. The problem I have with this book is the numerous references to George W. Bush and how he avoided this trap, or overcame this situation. The fact that Wead works for ""W"" becomes very apparent. In Wead's mind George W. Bush is the next best thing to sliced bread and can do no wrong. I have read other books on first families, and the stories are much more compeling when the author remains a 3rd party. I would give this book 6 or 7 stars if Wead had been able to stay non-partisan. Despite this problem, the book is interesting to read and I would recommended it too others, with a warning to be prepared for GWB worship."
1,strangely disappointed,I found this strangely dull. I wish I had liked it - I wanted to. I didn't find any relevance whatsoever to these lives and didn't think the profiles were well-organized - actually willy-nilly. I also thought it was confusing in its conclusions - there were too many conclusions!
3,Picture Needs Improving,"I've read all the reviews to date and no one - I mean no one - has mentioned the washed out quality of the film in a few places. I remember this movie as being vivid in its colors, but the DVD looks somewhat faded in comparison. This cries for a remastered DVD or Blueray, but seeing as this one probably isn't a big seller, you can rely on that happening as much as you can count on the filming of Aloha, Bobby and Rose II: Drift in the Valley starring Zac Efron. By the way, seeing Edward James Olmos as such a young Turk in Aloha is almost worth the price of the DVD."
1,"Absolute, rock-bottom worst movie I've ever seen","This is such a stinker Mystery Science 3000 wouldn't show it. So awful that the only reason for it to be remembered is because of its awfulness; a pointless, poorly-acted, nihilistic, dumb, senseless, plotless, clueless, phony, joke of a picture.2007 UPDATE TO MY 2003 review. One other thing: Bobby got what was coming to him!"
3,A film that grows on you...,"It's not the car chase film I thought it was going to be, but rather a road film that morphs into a twisted love story - cinematic dysfunction at its' 70's best. Plot is somewhat satisfying, but the acting is well done and sincere. Hull and Le Mat are a good match, but don't expect the same dynamic as in ""American Graffiti."" Tim McIntire gives the storyline the punch in the arm it needs...Try to rent before you buy...if you can find it. A must for Le Mat fans, but some may be disappointed in the brief showcasing of Le Mat's 68 Camaro...too nice a car and too little screen time. Definitely a film that grows on you after several viewings - a real drive-in classic."
4,Classic!,"I loved this 70's ""sappy"" love story since the first time I saw it many years ago. The acting itself is not very good, but if you love cars (especially the late 60's Muscle cars), you'll appreciate this ""bad-boy-on-the-run"" movie..."
2,Be Careful,"This is a ""Young Reader"" Book. Upon closer inspection, I see that the description on the website of the book say's it is only 32 pages, and only about a 1/4 of an inch thick. The text is also very large. This is for your 5th and 6th grade reading level. It is my own fault that I bought this book. I thought it was going to be much larger and a more in depth look at Steve Jobs. This is by no means a $15.00 book. Perhaps a $5.00 book would be more appropriate. This is definitly a 'Kids' Book."
1,poor quality,"not sure if I did anything wrong but the strings broke as I was tuning guitar. Overall, not satisfied with my purchase."
1,Overrated!,"This is an absolutely terrible dvd. While I think Irina very graceful and a great dancer, she lacks any ability as a teacher. Most instructional DVD's show you a move, at least once or twice, break it down, and then show the move slowly and then half speed, tempo and double time. Irina does absolutely NO instruction! She shows the move as she is doing it...with voice over I might add. Then the tempo picks up. I have had at least 4 or 5 beginning belly dance classes, so while I am NO expert, I know the basic moves. I found this very difficult to follow and keep up with. I wish I could return it. You could learn more on FitTV Shimmy. I am going to ask my belly dance teacher for a recommendation because clearly these reviews didn't help! Maggie"
3,Not for beginners,"Got this for Christmas. I've been taking dance for about 5 years now and this is definitely not a video for beginners. The steps are not broken down well and you only see each move about two or three times before she ""speeds it up"". I'm going to enjoy learning some new things, but I would be frustrated and probably ditch it if I were a beginner. I would have liked her to teach/speak on the video instead of in voice-over. If you're familiar with tribal or traditional bellydance style, you'll probably enjoy. Just watching her dance is a treat, as she is such a beautiful and fluid dancer. She really softens tribal style."
3,Not bad says I ...,"I picked this one at random from the horror films shelf at the local dive video store and was pleasantly surprised. I didn't even know that Patty Duke Astin and William Shatner were in it until I started to watch it, and to tell you the truth I don't know what it was doing in the horror section. This is technically a drama.Worth dipping into if you can find it at a video rental place somewhere, but not really suitable to own."
2,VERY DISSAPPOINTED,Expected a much more offering of different potatoe recipes. I was very disappointed for the price. Lacking a lot of recipes and casserole dish's.
5,great book,great gift for daughter in law...she loves it ...she loves any thing made with potatoes.lots of information about taters.
2,Search elsewhere,"I've used these speakers for a couple years now. Sound quality is decent at low volumes, but they just can't fill even a small room with music. They also developed a bad connection somewhere, so I have to adjust the volume knob just so so that I get sound out of both speakers. They are really nice looking, though.If you're buying these for a dorm room, or need some nice looking speakers for basic computer sound and nothing more, you could do worse than these 2200s. If you want to play enjoy music from your computer - spend a little more on some speakers with a little more juice."
2,I wanted to like them...,"These speakers have a great form factor and look great. The sound is alright, about what you'd expect for the price point. However, I've been having the same problem with the right speaker (the one with the knobs). When I go to adjust the volume there's a large amount of static suddenly, and one or both speakers will cut out unexpectedly or lose most volume. Messing around some more (sometimes for like a minute) will usually get the volume and sound in both speakers back where it should be, but that's still somewhat ridiculous."
3,Not bad...,"I really needed to replace my old Gateway speakers, and these were the only ones with a sub woofer-out line, which was a huge plus. There just isn't anything out there that has sub-out capability unless you spend $. I don't know when I ordered these, maybe couple months ago, no I dea what the warranty is, but the left speaker just died. I'm right back where I started. I think I'll try and find a used pair of gateway speakers on ebay instead. Rrrrr."
4,creative 2200 speakers,esthetics and sound quality are good for value. Minimal opportunities to expand including subwoofer connection.
3,Meh,Pros:-Small form factor-Stylish two-toned design-Easy to setupCons:-Sound quality is decent at best-Left speaker started buzzing
2,I've had better,I thought that these speakers would be worth the money. Believe me I get better performance out of cheaper ones. When I first got these they sounded great. The bass levels were perfect. It was the perfect pair of speakers for my desktop. Then after awhile the power/volume button started to short out. Whenever I needed to adjust the volume or turn in on/off I'd hear a static sound coming through. Then one day the left speaker just shut off. So I checked them with my mp3 player. Same problem. So if you want to spend money on something that'll last don't get these get the cheaper ones by creative. Those little 2 watt speakers are perfect.
3,6 month Maximum Life - Don't bother,"My speakers broke down within 6 months. The problem is that Creative skimped on the quality of the volume knob, so after a few months the knob will become static-y and lose the ability to control the volume. They even started buzzing loudly on their own even when i wasn't at my computer. They really are useless now and I got myself a more traditional pair of creative speakers that work fine. The sound is otherwise fine, but whats the point if you can't control the volume???"
1,Not reliable,"I bought these about a year ago. They sounded good for the size - however the price/performance is not stellar as some other reviewers will have you believe. I thought they were still worth it for a decent pair of good looking speakers.However these have issues with reliability - I had the same issue as another reviewer where changing the volume produced static noise from the right speaker. After that the left speaker produces buzzing all the time, so I can't really use these anymore. It has been less than a year since I bought them and they haven't been used very heavily or with high volume either - not worth the price."
4,great book,"The book is excellent.The quality of the print could be a little better.However, I do realize that a lot of text is squeezed into the book,if the print were larger the book would be very large.If it were any darker it would bleed through to the other side.It is certainly very readable as it is.It is paperback and I just got it so I do not know how it will hold up."
2,The Training of the Twelve,"I do not remember ordering this book If I did it was not for my own use, but that of my husband."
2,Not as good as 1st edition with Jurgen Grunn as co-author,"The first edition had better photographs, less obedience information, more on the Yorkshire Terrier, less general information - (which does not apply to Toy dogs usually). In the first edition - which had Jurgen Grunn as co-author, there was a photograph on page 29 which shows the difference between a very young puppy and its dam.This has been extremely useful to show buyers who sometimes wonder, seeing an 8 week-old puppy, if that is a pure-bred Yorkie since it so very different from its parents."
5,Helpful- a good guide!,"This is a really helpful, interesting book about Yorkies, and dogs in general! This is a great book is you're getting you're first dog, or first Yorkshire Terrier! It covers all the basics, and if you're thinking about getting dog this is a great book. Although some things like training would require aditional information, this book is a clear, easy to read guide to owning a dog, more specifically a Yorkie. I have refered back to this book many times in my first year with my dog!"
4,Grannie,"The Athena Anna Sleigh Toddler bed in white is an attractive and sturdy bed. It does fit a standard crib mattress and sheets. From reading the item description before ordering, I expected the bottom to be a solid piece of wood. The bottom is made of slats. The instructions for putting the bed together are not well written. The construction required two adults and considerable time. The finished product is satisfactory."
3,NOT AS PICTURED,"I bought this particular toddler bed based on the fact that the picture of the product didn't have an additional leg in the middle of the bed. I know I would stub my toe a million times on a bed that had one. Sadly, when the bed arrived, it has an additional leg in the middle! WHY DOES IT NOT LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE!!!! I feel ripped off."
1,Nigerian Mathematicians Called Oyibo a 419 Mathematician,"Crank Dot Net gave Oyibo its highest rating - a five star or ""CRANKIEST."" Crank Dot Net is the authority on ""cranks, crackpots, kooks and loons on the net.""The National Mathematical Centre, Abuja, Nigeria denounced Oyibo as a FRAUD. [This Day (Nigeria) - December 27, 2004, allafrica dot com]"
4,"Well, I liked it.","'Doubt!!' revolves around 15-year-old, Ai Maekawa, and her quest to become beautiful. After an embarrassing experience in middle school, she severs ties with her old life, and is accepted into a high school where know one knows of her or her past. During the break between middle and high school she focuses on becoming beautiful for her high school debut. When she arrives, she gets exactly what she wished for.I don't quite understand why so many people are upset with this manga. Sure, the whole premise seems a bit superficial, but I don't believe `Doubt!!"" is really meant to be taken too seriously. It's so much fun to read! I love the characters and there are moments where it's really cute and hilarious. I'm definitely enjoying it so far."
4,German Task Force SFOR/KFOR miniatures,"good quality miniatures. Note: painting them right out of the box is impossible since the oils on them make it tough for paint to stick to them. Wash them in the sink with luke warm water and some dish soap. Other than that great for any D20, board game, or hobby enthusiast."
3,a guide to owning a newf,"It was quite a good book, even though it was short. (only 64pages).If you already own a newf, i wouldn't suggest you buying it, because you know it all already, but if you're getting one soon or thinking about getting one, it's a good book, because it has all you need to know about newfs, briefly."
4,Enjoyable,"Enjoyed the book. It has many twists and turns. The plot was rather predictable,but an easy read after all."
5,An enjoyable read!,"You will want to curl up on the couch with this book. Romantic, charming and full of characters you'll want to learn more about every chapter."
4,Worth the Read,There are moments where the author seems a little overwhelmed in attempting to communicate points in the story and other moments where she is spot-on. Overall an enjoyable story and worth reading.
3,Good but a bit slow.,This was a nice read. I loved the story line but felt it stalled a bit at times. Still...a nice read.
3,Good old honest life.....,"What i nice book to read , full of little lessons . Most relaxing and easy to read.Loved it!"
4,Wonderful book,"This was a great book. I do not often read the christian romance books, but I was glad I took the time to read this one. It was so well written and put together. The characters were so well developed and time period flowed so smooth that I could picture it all in my mind. It is not oftern that an author can develop as many characters as were in this book and keep them all interesting, but this arthor managed to do just that. I enjoyed this book very much."
5,Awe,"Such a sweet story! Yes its long , but well worth the time. I thoroughly enjoyed this story and its faith references, reminding me to be humble yet also in action so that i may grow in gods love."
4,Widow of Larkspur Inn,Very good book. Has a little bit of everything withoug going overboard.When I can't wait to get back to my Kindle to read a book then I know it is really good.
3,widow of larkspur inn,"A bit like an old fashioned Victorian novelette,light entertainment. All too good to be true and ofcourse a happy ending, certainly no twists and turns in this ""plot"". A good book to put you to sleep."
5,Great book,This is the only book I have read in the series. I would love to read the rest of the series. This book was a great book that kept me up reading it because I just had to find out what happened next! But this was a good book.
4,"Good Story, Bad Ending","I enjoyed this book very much. The charming characters commanded attention from the very beginning. My only real criticisms are (1) some of the minor details seemed wrong for the period (e.g. notebook paper in 1869?) and, (2) the widow went to bed one night deciding to love the guy, and the next morning woke up and accepted his marriage proposal. It was too abrupt and unbelievable. The story ended almost immediately after the proposal. Yes, I know the story is continued in the next book, but this one felt chopped off a little prematurely."
4,"Widow of Larkspur Inn, The","I really had a good time reading ""TheWidow of Larkspur Inn "". It was thoroughly enjoyable, and I will read more books from this author."
2,Don't waste your time,"I really enjoyed Ms. Blackwell's writing style. But the book drags on and on, with nothing interesting happening. The writer gives almost an hour-by-hour accounting of the lives of the people involved, but it went on so long that I just couldn't care. It was also almost completely historically inaccurate, which made it hard to enjoy as well. This book should be labelled as Christian fiction, it was an overwhelming aspect of the story, and got more so as the book went on. I would perhaps try more from this author, but only if it was free."
4,Excellent!,I truly enjoyed this free book on my kindle! I will definitely pay to read the rest of the series....
4,Widow of Larkspur Inn,"This book was quite good .I enjoy the scripture verses,and I am looking forward to reading the next one in the series."
3,Okay read,"Didn't really capture my attention right away. I'm still reading it, but there is no urgency to finishing the novel whatsoever. As a free down load, it wasn't that bad @ all."
4,Loved it,I really liked this book. A good story with a good message to read and learn about. Would recommend to others.
5,Julia,The strength and determination this woman has is absolutely incredible! I wish to have her strength some day! God Bless.
2,Not my kind of book too romantic,Would appeal to a reader of romance.I prefere more action.just thought it was too low key to the nornal books I read
5,Sigh…,A beautifully illustrated example of the difference between a relationship based on infatuation and one of choosing to love someone. I really enjoyed this novel.
4,A Comforting Read,"This is a pleasant book to curl up and read on a gloomy day. The writing flows nicely, the characters are likeable, and the growth of the main character, Julia, is well-done. I have no objections to depictions of faith in fiction, but the author tended to be a touch too preachy in too many places, which diminished my rating of this otherwise quietly romantic piece."
3,"Not a 5 star, but enjoyable enough","Despite the religious preaching which I admit became too much, the book was overall fairly enjoyable. It was totally predictable so no surprise endings, but the characters were likable enough. When the main character finds out on her husband's death that he has gambled away their money and she is forced to move to a rundown inn, I actually applauded her ability to overcome diversity. What mother wouldn't do the same in order to support her children? I loved the shortcomings of her boarders and the friendships that are formed from living in close proximity to one another. While it may not be historically factual as others have pointed out, this is fiction and should be enjoyed as such."
3,Overall very good,"While I must admit this book was not a captivating page turner, it was overall very good. My only disappointment was that it took several hundred pages for me to get really involved in the storyline. I am glad that I stuck with it because it turned out to be very enjoyable. This is the first book I have read by this author and she has sparked my interest enough that I will probably read the rest of this series."
4,I enjoyed this book,"It was well written, a good plot line, the characters were well handled. A good, clean read for entertainment. I will look for more of this author."
5,Widow of Lakespur Inn,"Enjoyed the simplicity of the story, and the faith in our Lord that was shown to make all things possible."
5,Thoroughly enjoyable read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful read. While it's not Pride and Prejudice by any means, I loved the well developed characters and the glimpse into the daily lives of this period."
4,Presently surprised,"I don't normally read Christian fiction, but this one pleasantly surprised me. It's a very well written, pleasant book. I look forward to reading more in this series."
5,Felt like I was there,"I love how the author has taken a woman in a horrible situation and given her hope through her faith. Her descriptions of the village and characters makes you feel like your walking through it with her. A good, wholesome, positive read."
4,Good Christian romance,I was pleasantly supprised by this book! It was a very good read. I liked the Christian basis but it wasn't over the top either. I will probably read this again....and I couldn't beat the price....FREE!
4,the widow of larkspur inn,"Very good read, enjoyed it, can't wait to read the next one. The descriptions were very good, and story very gripping."
5,Loved it!,I am thinking about reading it again and then want to read the rest of the series! I didn't want it to end!!
3,Widow of Larkspur Inn,I liked the story but felt it was to slow moving. I enjoy reading stories from the 19th century and romances.
5,The first of four...will certainly read them all!,Loved this book. It puts you back in Old England and makes you wish you had really been there. And there is an integrity that is often missing in modern novels.
4,Enjoyable Read,"I did enjoy reading this book. It was a relaxing story, but not too simple.A good Christian romance. I would highly recommend it."
4,Great read,"It kept you entertained and well on one's seat. The Characters were charming, easy a ;) d fast read. Now on to read the other ones!!"
5,Wonderful romance,"When Julia Hollis' husband dies, she is distraught to learn he left them penniless except for Larkspur Inn in Gresham Green. She must take her three children and move from London to Gresham Green immediately, becuase there is no money for them to live on. With a loan from her former butler, she manages to fix up the inn and decides to take in lodgers who will live there instead of overnight guests. How she manages to fit into the small village of Gresham Green, stregthen her faith and guide her children as well is a wonderful story. I would recommend this book to any romantic book lover."
3,Slow-moving but good,"This book had it's funny moments and enjoyable moments. It moves very slow and the love stories are very rushed. Overall, it's a good read for a lazy winter day."
4,Nice read,"Enjoyable story, but very predictable ending. Nice to have things come out right in the end though. For free fiction it was very good."
4,enjoyable,Only started this book because my last name is the same as the town. Was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Very good read.
4,Widow of Larkspur Inn,"Even though the plot was rather predictable, the historial details were very interesting and the inspirational passages were well done."
2,Terrible ending,I loved the story. I had a hard time putting it down. But the ending was terrible. It just ended.
2,Historically inaccurate and way too Evangelical,"This book was free for Kindle. I'm glad it was free because I will probably not be purchasing any other books by this author. A total fail on 2 counts; clumsy Christianity and bad historical research.I just don't understand why she wanted to place the setting for this series in England. Her ""research"" on 1870s England seems limited to watching ""Little House"" on TV and (perhaps) glancing at a map of England. Anachronisms abound. I did read to the end, but just to laugh at the blatant inaccuracies.If the author had set this book in 1870s USA, I might have given it 3 stars. It might have made 4 stars had the evangelizing been less clumsy. The story is also very predictable.I gave this book the second star because the author is quite good at characterization and it was reasonably well written with relatively few errors in grammar. I was being generous."
3,Decent read,"An ok read, but too slow for me. I enjoyed the subplots more than the main characters story. I struggled to finish it."
5,lorinmexico,Excellent book. Drew me in to the lives of the characters. Already read the sequel and are going to buy the 3rd now.
3,Good Flow,Story flowed well. I love period stories so this was a nice treat. Have to admit that religion is very prominent throughout but adds to the strength of the story.
3,Faith based novel,"The writing is good, but the childish type of Christian faith interposed is wearing. God is not mentioned when ill befalls the widow, but is praised for all good things that occur. I am uncertain I can finish the decently good story as the fairy tale of a God who has no power over evil but deserves all credit for good seems to increasingly be the real story proposed. I really wish that these authors or Amazon would simply label this type book as faith based so that those of us who wish to avoid these or find these novels could easily do so"
4,good read,"This book was very good, it kept you wanting to know what would happen next. The characters in the story were interesting and different. A good read."
3,Like Gothics?,Not a deep book but it is entertaining.I used to read Gothics and that is what this reminded me of.
5,:o),Loved it and can't wait to read the other two books!Searching now for the other two books to download.
4,Larkspur Inn,This is a sweet Christian based story which was very refreshing. I enjoyed being able to relax and know all would come out peacefully in the end.
4,Nice Christian Romance,"I downloaded this for free and found it to be a pleasant easy read and the Christian lessons a nice reminder of my faith. The characters were believable and Lawana drew me into the story. Although predictable, I nevertheless had a hard time putting it down. A great read for me at Christmas!"
4,"Lovely, Uplifting!","If you love to read uplifting, historical, christian books this is the one for you. The thing that I really liked was that it was not preachy. Just enough faith scenes that it kept me reading. I gave it 4 stars because it was some what predictable."
4,Easy Read,"I enjoyed this escape very much. I started reading it Saturday morning and completed it Sunsday afternoon. Filled with romance, faith, betrayal and love..from beginning to end. A sweet book to read on a rainy weekend."
4,Peaceful reading,I did enjoy this book. It illustrates how your own attitude can affect your life. You can be happy if you choose to be. Also demonstrates that depression can affect anyone but doesn't mean you can never find happiness. Lots of positives!
4,Widow,"This was a surprisingly good read!All the characters in the book worked well towards a very nice ending.I loved all the evolving relationships, even the ones the children formed and how that was integrated in the story!I don't normally read these ""clean"" romances, but this one was definitely in a different league.Pick this book up, you will love it!"
5,Good fiction,"This is a good, clean work of fiction. I liked all of the detail descriptions of people and places. Made me feel likeI was right in the story."
5,The Widown of Larkspur Inn,"I enjoyed this book very much. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good, wholesome story. The characters were very interesting and I just wanted to keep reading until the end. Looking forward to more."
1,Dull,"This book has got to be among the most dull and uninteresting books written. Nothing engaged me and in the end, I abandoned the book and dis not finish it."
5,GOOD BOOK,"I found this to be a delightful read and plan to soon start the next book in the series. It is interesting to read the reviews of others. Although this may not have been totally historically accurate, I seldom find much anymore that is, from novels to news commentators. Myself, I was into the story line from the first chapter and never getting bored with it! There are many times when I felt a break between paragraphs would have been helpful since it does jump from one person or place without indication. Also, it introduction of another character and his family midway though was unexpected and from that point on it was predictable how it would end but the getting there was . . . . fun. Also the gospel message was presented in a simple yet applicable way. A GOOD BOOK."
5,widow of larkspur inn,"This story is so good. It is about a coddled, wealthy, woman overcoming obstacles and standing on her own two feet with the help of God and friends. I love it."
4,Good book,"Easy reading Christian love story. A feel good story about overcoming adversity, lost love, and finding trust and faith in others."
2,Widow of Larkspur Inn,"Good Read, fast and with the right stuff, Romance, Faith, mystery and the dynamics of family and friend relationships, I would read this author again."
4,"Widow of Larkspur Inn , by The by LaWana Blackwell",I enjoyed this book very much. The way the main character prayed for guidance with each decision reminds you God is only a prayer away.
4,"lovely story, well developed and easy read","I truly enjoyed this book. It is well written and weaves a spell about the life in a small village many eons ago. Hard work, hard times and good people show what the rewards for living a simple life can be. I am so glad the story showed us what is really important in life. Good book to take to bed and rest easy with."
3,widow review,The book was long winded and didn't hold my interest for long. The ending really disappointed me. It was fast and had no feeling involved. However it did manage to have some good lessons to be learned.
2,Simple.,Simple story…spiritual undertones was a pleasant surprise though.However I think lovers of the historical romance genre will enjoy it.
3,Relaxing read.,"A easy relaxing read for an afternoon of pleasure! Gives some valued thought provoking issues without heavy ""preaching"". Thanks to Amazon for the book."
5,Widow of Larkspur Inn,"Enjoyed reading this book! The story starts with a sad beginning, but grows into a very happy ending. I can't wait to read the 2nd in this series."
2,Another good book ruined by sermonizing,"Julia married young into wealth to a successful London doctor; however 15 years and 3 children later, she is widowed and discovers her husband had a secret gambling habit leaving her with no means. However, she vows to care for her children and put her/their life back together. To do this, she relocates to the country, refurbishes a 200-year old inn and takes in boarders to make money. But, the auther ruins this book with the constant and frequent preaching and sermonizing."
2,good but not very good,"Love books taking place in the 17 and 1800's. This book is a nice read but just too much religion, reading of the bible and converting to the church. Liked the story but almost every paragraph lends towards God, the Church and Jesus..I don't have a problem with any of these subjects, but this book just heaped this on the reader at every turn. I pushed through, but would not recommend this book to any of my reader friends. Glad I didn't spend much money on this one..."
3,kay olson,"A good read;, but not one I would read again. Common theme and predicable ending. Was anxious to finish so I could go on to another book."
2,Boring,"I really tried to read this book. And it's rare that I dont finish a book. But- I just couldn't get into it. I stopped about two thirds into it. It was just too boring!The writing was ok, The characters were undeveloped, and the story was a bit cheesy. It was very predictable and situations were unrealistic.There is a ""hero"" or ""love intrest"" who isn't even introduced until more than halfway through the book. And it comes from nowhere. You're plodding along in the story and suddenly it switches to a whole new viewpoint- a new person. It's extremely confusing. After about a chapter of this new person, it's very clear exactly where this story will go. There will be no surprises.If you like books that are slow, low on romance, with a lot of preaching, than this is a good choice."
3,Quick read,"I enjoyed this book as a choice for light reading. If you are looking for in depth, full characters, this not for you. But if you like sweet story lines, tidy outcomes, and Jesus loves you themes, check it out.I will probably continue the series just to see what happens next."
2,Good but...,Although this is a good book. There are times when the characters get confusing. And although the writing is good I have read better. In conclusion this book is worth reading one time; but only when you have no other book.
3,"Inspiring, if nothing else.","While it wasn't a ""page turner"" that I couldn't put down, it was a very good book that I wanted to finish. The characters are well developed and the storyline drove me to my own Bible."
2,do yourself a favor...,"I say stay away from this game.It was 20 dollars wasted.Only good thing i could say about it is its graphics. Ok, you have that one.but seriously. the plot is extremely cliche. i remember one part of the game where it actually TELLS you.The big deal about this game is the multiplayer. I heard it's great when you have friends to play with, but no one I know owns this game.to be honest...i found this game difficult too. and im talking about playing with yourself. by the second stage i quit because it became frustrating. not really, but it became boring and uninteresting."
2,I would have finished it if the controls were better...,"From what I played, I did enjoy it. The one thing that got me so frustrated was the controls, which is why I never finished the game. I'm glad that they have improved that for the DS sequel (Ring of Fates). My hope for this game is that they make a Wii version and reformat the control system (like Nintendo has done for Pikmin). Or if they made a DS version of this game too, I would be happy with that!"
4,"Cool idea, but there is a serious lack of story","I think this was a mildly fun game. The idea of playing with 4 people sounded great at first, espeshilly w/ 2 brothers, until I found that one of them must carry the bucket, put it down, pick it up, put it down. The casting spells togeather looked fun too, but it was easier and more effective doing them separate. The music was great, different, but great. However, there was almost no story, which ultimatly led me to think that square was going crazy because all the final fantasy games are known for their story telling. Like a re-birth of square and its writors. Thus, it was a mildy fun game, playing by yourself that is, just have an open mind when you play, and dont compare it to some of squares other work."
3,This game is ok.,"Ok when i got this game i was pretty excited. i had heard a lot of good things about final fantasy games. it wasnt all i thought it would be though. i personally dont like the fighting system and the magic is very limited and its annoying to try to cast a spell bcause you have to hold down a button, wait for the blue ring to appear then move the ring to where you want the spell to hit. the graphics are good though and you ride a caravan across four different sections of the world map trying to recover myrrh which holds off a deadly disease, miasma threatening the life of towns everywhere. a variety of things can happen along your journey. you can meet people from other tribes and you also keep track of a diary. i would advise your money for a better game."
1,Don't buy it!,"This is a bad game and when i say bad I mean It Sucks! This game has really bad graphics compared to all the other Final Fantasies and terrible gameplay. I was expecting something really big when I heard it was coming back to Nintendo but I was wrong! The best part about this game is creating your character at the begining. That is about all this game has to offer. You mine as well play the Super Nintendo FF! And if you have already bought it... I feel very sorry.. and for those of You who were thinking about buying it, I hope I have saved you."
1,not a well developed game,"I was looking forward to finally having a Final Fantasy game on my Gamecube, but I was very disappointed in this game. About the only good thing is the graphics. The game itself gets repetitive, all you do is carry a bucket around year after year through the same level. Soon it'll feel like your not getting anywhere in the game. I didn't even bother finishing the game, I gave up in the middle and moved on. Another thing is that the way the charecters move in the cutscenes are like the way the charecter in Zelda for the N64 move. I don't even understand why Nintendo even decided to have a Final Fantasy game like this. they should have compared this to all the other Final Fantasy. So I think you should save your money and buy something worth buying."
1,This game made me hate Final fantasy until I had played others...,"Seriously please do not buy this game. It's literally terrible. My ex bf loved it and he was stupid and mindless, however EVERYONE ELSE hated this game. Its boring, easy and pointless. Also to have multiple players you have to have multiple game boy advances and wires. So I had to go half and half to buy game boy advances to get my 3 friends to play with me.I hated Final Fantasy assuming they were all like this until I played 9 then 7 and LOVED those, they had a story...there is no story at all to this game it's just stupid little battles here and there and you have to carry a chalice. I don't think there is an end you play ""years"" and fill said chalice then restart all levels again for next year.This is only good if your a kid and ever played a video game before."
5,Great Game Even After Years,"I bought this game because I remembered when I was younger playing this originally on my friends game cube every weekend with our GBA's. It had a great concept; it had awesome maps, and great dungeons. After all these years, it still does. FFACC had great visuals back when it was released and on the Wii it still is a beautiful graphics a great buy and I recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and well made game for your Wii or your old game cube."
1,Save the money for something else!!!!,"This game is LAME!!! It should be called Final Fantasy: the Crystal Losers Chronicles. all the final fantasy fans, expected a big game, and because Square Enix begins again making games for Nintendo, got all of the Final Fantasy Fans excited. The game is totally lame, has a serious lack of story!!! Seriously!!!!! You get to pick the name of your town, your character, gender, etc, and then, your on your own, you meet other caravans(but nothing big) and you fight monsters,(SPOILERS)and when you fight the Final Boss, you discover that it's all based on memories,(END OF SPOILERS)and the end is a big piece of crap!The multiplayer version, it's the same, but you can play with your friends, and it's almost impossible to play, cause every player needs a nintendo advance, to play, and to do the spells is very hard!!I just hope that the sequel isn't as lame as this one!!"
3,The Magical Bucket! What is Square thinking?,"My first thoughts when I heard Square-enix was making a FF game for Cube? I thought awesome!! More Final Fantasy! Then I started seeing some pictures. ""Wow Nintendo was succesful in Nintendofying another great game"" (kids saving the world, are you kidding me!) But I still said that I would give the game a chance. Next I find out that the battle system will be in real time!!! That is not Final Fantasy. So now I say this. What is going on in Square's head? Why don't they just chop off the Final Fantasy name and make the game Crystal Chronicles.This still may be a decent game but in respect to Final Fantasy it will be an abysmal game"
2,bait and switch,"Yay, finally a ff game for the GCN. I've been waiting a long time. But wait a minute, whats that you say. A bucket! You carry around a bucket the whole game and you have to stay in the buckets magical ring or you lose health. Oh, did i mention its not even turn-based. In other words this is gauntlet with the name final fantasy tattooed on it. Don't get me wrong, I love Gauntlet, but when i want a FF game, i want a final fantasy game.This is all speculation, who knows the game might still be cool(praying with all my heart). Also, to play multiplayer you need four gba's and four link cables. That is fantastically gay.Give us a real GCN FF game please Square, or maybe kingdom hearts(yeah right)."
5,A new style of Final Fantasy!,"Finally! A game that you can walk around killing enemies. Unlike the other final fantasy games for PS2,you don't stand there waiting to get killed. In this game you can run around casting spells and attacking people with your weapon.Also unlike the other PS2 FF games, you can choose a variety of charactors. There are four races that you can choose from (clavat, lilties, yukes, selkie). a clavat is ok in everything. A Lilty is good in speed. A Yuke is good in charging up focus attacks(a charged up attack that is 3x's the original attack).A lilty is good in speed but if you don't want a charater that lacks the speed of charging up spells and focus attacks,DO NOT PICK THIS CHARACTER!! A Selkie is long-ranged in his/her focus attack.The ememies can look cool yet messed up. They usually attack you in twos or threes.This Game is awesome. If you want a violent adventure game, get this!"
3,Disappointing for Final Fantasy Fans,"Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles was an extremely anticipated game for all of us Final Fantasy fans. The game however is nothing like anything we've ever seen before. Unfotunately thats not a good thing. The new gameplay, unlike the amazing battle system of final fantasy XII, is boring, difficult to use, and unproductive. The story is boring and extremely repetitive. You chase all over the world chasing after crystals and meeting some extremely cheesy characters along the way. If I were you I would rent the game (You could probably beat it in a day) and never play it again."
2,"Wow, what a horrible game","Though you might think this game it a fun, turn-based strategy, it's not. It would be fun if it was longer and you didn't replay levels on the main quest. Though you easily get bored in the first few levels and vow never to play again. And all the people who wanted to preorder it..."
4,say it with me ... awesome,"This game rocks i'm telling you if you have a game cube there are 3 games you must have super smash bros. melle, pokemon colleseum ( ...) , and ff crystal chronichles. even though the camera sucks and if you or pet isn't carrying a bucket you lose life and you have to carry it wich really sucks when your fighting a boss but overall this game is awesome."
3,Fun but needy game,"Finally a good co-op story mode RPG game! Enjoyable gameplay, but a very clunky experience.Its the only game I've ever played that requires not only a gamecube and disc, but 2 GAMEBOY ADVANCES, 2 special cables AND a LAPTOP to play so you know what the hundreds of poorly labeled in-game items are for!!"
4,dont worry,at first i didnt think i was going to get what i wanted but i decided to give them a chance anyway. now that i know that im going to get what im paying for im sure ill be making more purchases with amazon.com. so if your not sure about the delivery but youre sure the item is what you want go for it and give amazon.com a chance.
5,smooth sound,My hat goes off to Deon for this one! The smooth sound will make any non-jazz lover convert.
1,Junk,"Came with cracked handle, worked ok for 10 minutes, then developed a nasty air leak. Took it apart and was amazed it lasted that long! Metal filings and cheap, cheap, cheap O-rings. Obviously a bad knock off of the bostich design."
1,I bought two...,"I bought two of the Grizzly H5977 flooring staplers and unfortunately one of them lasted only two weeks before it started leaking air and soon after the other actually broke apart at the base. Believe it or not, it did work for a couple of weeks after the front of the base broke off before it too, succumbed to seal failure and developed an air leak. In other words do not let the price fool you, pay the higher price for a stapler that will work longer."
1,Poor stapler,"This stapler worked well for about 500 sq. ft. and then it went down hill from there. The base plate broke like the reveiwer before me and the seal started leaking and eventually would not cycle. This all happened before I installed 1000 sq. ft. I know it's tempting to buy this tool if you're only installing a couple of rooms but don't do it, save yourself the frustration and rent or buy another brand. I bought the Bostitch and haven't had any problems now for several thousand feet. I'm a home builder that installs my own floors and the guys that do this for a living earn their money. Don't make the job any harder than it has to be, buy or rent a quality tool for this job."
2,ok,"The first floor stapler the driver pin sheared after about 400 ft2 of hard maple, rendering it useless. Grizzly offered to either ship my a new part to repair it, or charge me for a new unit and then refund me my money when I sent the broken unit back. I went with the latter. The 2nd unit finished the job (about 1000 ft2 or miscellaneous hard wood flooring and Grizzly did refund me my money even though it took me about 8 months to get around to shipping the broken unit back. I'd say if you are strapped for cash and have a limited amount of flooring to put down, the Grizzly is okay. The unit never jammed on me and misfired about as often as a nice Bostich unit I borrowed while waiting for the replacement Grizzly. The hammer is definitely cheap, but it does the job. I am a quality tool guy and swallowed my pride a little to buy this unit since I knew I wouldn't be using it that much. I'm still chocking on it a little."
5,grizzley h5977,"package delivered promptly, product seem to be of good quality (especially for the price!) I have only tested but it worked flawlessley."
4,Interesting book but didn't rock my world,"As someone who feels that too much superstition and religion has been wrapped around the simple truths of Buddhism, I was intrigued by the title of this book. In my case the author was preaching to the choir, but this would probably be a good read for someone who feels like they're on the right road but perhaps headed in not quite the right direction."
4,Buddhism depends on understanding,"Of the Four Noble Truths, I think the second applies to several of the negative reviews: The second truth is that suffering is caused by craving and aversion. We will suffer if we expect other people to conform to our expectations, if we want others to be like us. As for the book, the Buddha himself asked his followers to test his teachings rather than accept his words blindly. Buddhism depends on understanding, not faith or belief."
4,"start on the path, then read this book","I perhaps made the mistake of reading this book on Buddhism first, before any others. It resonated with me but I had difficuty grasping the complexity of the arguments without a more basic grounding in Buddhism. (For that I recommend any of the Tricyle's introductory books, John Snelling's 'Elements of Buddhism', and Jack Kornfield'd 'A Path with Heart'). I returned to book again with a more seasoned and educated mind and found it to be provocative and relevant to thinking afresh for oneself on the Buddhist Path. Batchelor reduces Buddhist principles to their essentials, sweeps away the accretions of 2,000 years of cultural dogma that have muddied the path, and shows a way for the contemporary Westernized Buddhist to proceed. And, whether on not you agree with him, if you appreciate good writing, this it is beautifully written book."
4,Comfortable with Uncertainty,I found this book appropriate for starting to learn with the discomfort of change in terms of ideas and practice to learn the attitudes recommended.
5,Buddhism Without Beliefs,"Absolutely right on the mark. Way overdue, especially for the American Buddhist community. A must read for every serious path follower. Thank you Stephen."
5,Buddhism for 21st Century,"Stephen is spearheading an important movement to re-awaken us to the essential core teachings of the Buddha, which is about awakening to our own true nature and see how we creat inner violence and outer violence through blind attachment to opinions, beliefs and dogma. This is exactly what the Buddha wanted us to do. To read more about mindfulness meditation and the process of awakening presented in this new non-domatic approach, I also recommend 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation' available through Amazon."
3,"Not really all that good, unfortunately.","Batchelor takes the teeth out of Buddhism, and contributes to an unfortunate trend of trivializing eastern spirituality. It's the perfect book for the '90's, fashionable, non-threatening, and just not all that good. I would not argue that awakening is not a good thing. I would argue that awakening is not independent of some sort of theology. This is, I admit, my own personal bias, but it bothers me to see someone take a religion (yes, it's not a philosophy, it's a religion) and co-opt the parts that are convenient while ignoring or explaining away the parts that are difficult for westerners (like reincarnation).Some people may benefit from this book as a stepping stone to something more profound, which gives it some value.Then again, it could be that I just don't get it."
1,Not a good read if you're looking to learn about Buddism,"I read this book several years ago while trying to get a grasp on Buddism. The book seemed confusing and when I finished reading it, my knowledge of Buddism was not expanded."
1,Lacking insight,Buddhism without karma or rebirth is like a car with no engine and no wheels...it's not going anywhere. The author kept calling for creative ideas to keep buddhism relevant in the contemporary world but brought very little to the table himself. I kept thinking perhaps he was saving his inspiring thoughts for the last chapter but this never happened. The material is dry and overwritten and in my opinion the author is at a dead end.
2,Buddhism on its head,"'Buddhism Without Beliefs' represents, some would argue, a radical existential view of Buddhism: There is no true reality--only my experience. If we accept this, Batchelor calls on us to dump rebirth and karma, since we have no experience of them, so that we are faced with an ""existential, therapeutic and liberating agnosticism."" But this is only playing with words. Batchelor is really marketing a radical acceptance of one's ignorance and suffering which, in effect, turns Buddhism on its head."
1,Beliefs Without Buddhism,"A better title would be Beliefs Without Buddhism. In the West, especially the USA, many ""Buddhist"" have adopted ""Buddhism"" to be free of their traditional religions, not because of the message of Buddha. Even worse, when they have not experienced their own Enlightenment, they make unenlightenment their dogma. I have studied extensively with Zen Masters in the West and East, those in the West have the system and verbage, but not the Heart of Insight (except Cleary!). This book does a great disservice to Buddhism, missing the essentials. Anyother book is better."
1,Confused,"I think the author is confused about what Buddhism is. I think if this book was just written as a personal experience without religion connotations it would be good. But it had little to do with Buddhism. I would not recommend this for beginners, a better book is 'A Buddhism Primer - An Introduction to Buddhism', a great book if you are looking for facts."
2,Not for me,I had recently become interested in Buddhism and consider myself agnostic so I thought this book would be right up my alley. Unfortunately I wasn't inspired by it at all.
5,Liberation by any other name,"I don't know who the other reviewer is from Lexington, although, important as he is, I suppose I should. I do know that we have little in common other than our Central Kentucky location. That Stephen Batchelor deconstructs Buddhist religiosity to arrive at its therapeutic core I find infinitely liberating. I am not persuaded by ""sola scriptura,"" whether invoked by the illustrious ""Dr. of Buddhology"" or the Christian fundamentalists who dominate the religious (and political) landscape here in the Bluegrass.What, finally, is more important? Deference to the Tripitaka or releasing oneself and others from suffering?And shouldn't a ""Dr."" of anything know how to spell?"
4,A useful approach to Buddhism for westerners,"I enjoyed this book very much. There is a lot of good stuff written about Buddhism for westerners these days, and there is a lot of tripe too. The latter is often characterized by romantic and flowery misrepresentations of ""enlightenment"" as a state of bliss and profound cosmic consciousness. The authors of these books pay lip service to the central Buddhist idea of no-self, but in the end the idea is to build up a new and improved ego. Batchelor's book is characteristic of a more hard-headed and ""take your medicine and deal with it"" sort of Buddhism, not unlike that of Charlotte Beck. I particularly like the way he attacked the misuse of the concept of karma - i.e., as just another religious ""behave yourself and you'll get a nice cookie when you die"" salve for the ego. Most Buddhist writers dance around the topic of emptiness - Batchelor really gets into it and builds a useful approach to life around it. Recommended!"
4,Does Buddha Have Buddha Nature?,"Stephen Batchelor makes a strong case for agnostic Buddhism. According to Batchelor, the Buddha himself probably would not recognize his modern-day acolytes. Batchelor's research turns back the clock to Buddha's own time, and finds a documented case of a man subjecting himself to psycho-analysis. ""What are the causes of human suffering, and how can I avoid them?"" These kinds of questions bear little resemblance to the mysticism we associate today with Buddhism. Nontheless they are timeless and profound. And Buddha's answers are, as Batchelor suggests, something we can all apply to our own lives, regardless of our various mystical adherences.As this and many of the reviews here suggest, this book is a great read. Now, if only Jesus had kept a diary..."
5,finally someone makes sense,"after having read too many books that are either dogmatic and pedantic, assuming you'll agree with precepts on blind faith(e.g., thich nat hanh, llama goeshe), too practice-oriented, that never explain the logic behind the practice (e.g., jon kabat zinn), too metaphysical, bordering on poetic but incomprehensible (both suzukis), it was soooooo refreshing for someone to actually discuss their thoughts on WHY and HOW the dharma makes a benevolent difference.if you're a critical thinker, this may be one of the ONLY books that makes a beautiful way of thinking and being make sense to you. you may already understand a lot of the tenets, but it should help crystallize your thinking and make it more coherent."
4,Ignore the Dogmatists And Check Out This Book,If you look through the bad reviews you will see that most of the naysayers trumpet their vast Buddhism libraries. They also refer to the author as being incompetent despite the fact that he was an ordained monk of Tibetan Buddhism for twenty years before he left the order to go on his own path. Could it be that faced with the reality that Buddhism does not depend upon zealous adhearence to invented orthodoxy and vain accumulation of obscure texts and knowledge these naysayers are trying desperately to cling to the trappings of their false piety?
1,Are the other reviewers members of his family?,"I enjoy books on Buddhism, but this one is a clear disappointment. He seems like a Westerner who has been exposed to some basic tenets of Buddhism but is anything but a wise master. I kept waiting for it to get better, it never did."
1,Buddhism by an Angry Materialist,"Its not that this slim book is neither scholarly nor articulate.It is the problem that Bachelor himself clearly lacks any insight, depth, compassion or meditative experience. He is a ""talking head"" blithely listening to his own intellectual drone, while basically denigrating and scoffing at those who do have experiential knowledge of the tenets of Buddhism. The beauty of Buddhism is that it is a practicing religion. If you want proof of its ideas, including life beyond the body, that can absolutely be verified through direct perception of the mind..but NOT through listening to the mind's chatter of discursive thought. Note that Bachelor was NOT published by any reputable Buddhist publishers such as Wisdom Books or Snow Lion, but by a imprint of a major commercial publishing house that is purely profit-oriented. Maybe he will believe in Karma when he experiences the fruition of misleading and fooling the gullible."
1,Negative 5 star,"Batchelor appears to me as one who's rather confused about what Buddhism is.Many westerners find this book appealing. I could see why: much of what the author says affirms their preconcieved notions--not what the Buddha recommended in the Kalama Sutta.I wish I could rate it ""negative 5 star""."
4,This group should have been more famous,"This album made me want to dance in the '80's, and it still does. It's absolutely exhuberent, and the melodies are fun. Great girlgroup reggae pop. I highly recommend it for anyone who likes to dance, but hates the souless pop and soul they've been shoving down our throats for the past 30 years.Try it!Why on earth didn't they do a second album?"
4,the cpu doesnt cheat,"what are u talking about if anything the cpu is too easy i beat this game in less than a week its so simple, u just either suck at racing games or cant figure out how press A. mario kart double dash is a great game to me, the only fault is it could of been more difficult because after u get gold on everything the only fun is racing ur friends but dont get me wronng that never does get old"
3,Great Kid's Game,"My 11 y.o. daughter received this game in a Gamecube Bundle for Christmas. I see her playing this game more than any other. $49 is pricey for this game and I doubt I would have purchased it separately---glad it was included!5 stars for fun: many levels and options, three ways to play3 stars overall: too expensive, good family game but I thinkteens and older my find it a bit childish"
5,Mario Kart of Fun,"This game is great! Lots of fun for the whole family. It allows us to spend time together laughing and enjoying quality time as a family. In a world of technology breaking down communication and interpersonal relationships, this technology creates an environment of togetherness. We look forward to playing it several times each week."
5,fun game for all,"Like practically all Mario games, this one's jam-packed with fun! (""Most"" because ""Paper Mario"" sucks!)"
5,Another Hit by Nintendo,"This game rocks! It is a little different from Super Mario Kart for SNES and Mario Kart 64 in that there are two characters per kart, but there inlies the fun! Twice the question blocks, more strategy (as far as when to release your items vs when to hold on to them) and added features like having a second player controll one of the characters (allowing your back character to punch other karts). New courses are a lot of fun and CGI charactes are an exciting challenge in the 150cc races.Update, Sep 2012: This game rocks! My wife and I still are not tired of playing it! We even wiped the memory so we could play through it again :) We love Mario Kart racing and always can't wait for the next game to be released :)"
5,Double Dash of Excitement,"Although no one can give this game an honest review, as it is not out yet...I think it is quite obvious what the results will be: A definite 5 star sequel. Everyone loves playing Mario Kart games whether they choose to admit it or not, so naturally... this game will be one of Gamecubes top sellers if not the top-most. And, although X-box and PS2 have their high points, few things can compete with a good Mario Kart game, especially when it has 128 bit graphics, twice the amount of players, better karts, and options to fly, drive, or go by boat. Every gamecube owner should by this game at any cost."
2,Not what I was expecting,"Mario Kart: Double Dash has 3 main problems:The steering is very very tough to control. You practicly have to jam down on the control stick to get the cart to turn.You cannot pause during a race. That's very bad when you have to go somewhere during a race-- it makes you either miss the race or be late for where you are going.The ""Double Dash"" part has no effect on the game at all. It doesn't matter if your character is in the front or back of the cart, you still have to control both characters.Overall, very very disappointed in this Nintendo game."
4,A game which trades single play for multiplay,"Pros: Able to ""Double Dash"" (Using two items in one box and using two characters). Wide selection of character and great for muliplaying. Big kart selection and a good racer overall.Cons: It lacks things to do in the single player.Get this if you need a racer and wouldnt mind trading single play for multiplay."
4,Reminiscent of ''Mario Kart 64'',I'm a fan of ''Mario Kart 64'' and this game tops it off nicely. Bowser's casle is a good remake of a great course. Rainbow road is a lot better than the original and isn't as long and the new courses are very fun also. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because some of the characters look kinda plasticy (cough cough wario & waluigi).
4,Cool game,The grandkids love it and continue playing it. The game was in great condition as described. Will be ordering some more games soon.
5,love mario kart then buy this,love mario kart then buy thislove mario kart then buy thislove mario kart then buy thislove mario kart then buy this.
3,More Mario Kart fun!,"Mario Kart: Double Dash is an enjoyable continuation in the Mario Kart series. New racecourses and fun multiplayer games make this a great addition to the series! I was a little dissapointed that some stages can only be used in multiplayer mode, but there are still a lot of options for single player that provide hours of fun. Thanks!"
3,I don't like racing games.,"So maybe I'm the wrong person to be doing a review. But they are all basically the same and while Double Dash looks pretty it does little to further the genre.The graphics are, quite simply, gorgeous. Mario Kart Double Dash shows what the Gamecube is capable of with brilliant colors, wonderful landscapes and vivid race courses. The sound isn't up to much though. Sound effects are kind of generic and the music is hardly a standout.Pretty much, if racing games are for you then Mario Kart Double Dash is essential if you have a Gamecube. I couldn't care less about this genre so I can gladly never play again, no matter how stunning it looks."
3,Mario Kart..............finished!,"I own this game, and I must say; Mario Kart-Double Dash is short.So short, it took me 3 hours to beat. It's beater to rent, or you could sell it if you buy it. Choose Mario and Luigi-for example- and race through all the courses (50cc, 100cc, 150cc)which would take about 1 hour. Then special cup will appear. Race through it and you've won the game! Note: there are hidden bonuses throughout the game."
3,dosen't match up to snes and 64,"while this game is fun, its not nearly the classic snes or 64 mario kart games. but thats just kinda how the gamecube is. snes invented the game in glorious 2D, 16-bit graphics, with classic characters, simple controls and unlimited replay value. then N64 moved the game into 3D, and 64-bit graphics, but most importantly upgrading multyplayer to 4player. then gamecude came out with better graphics, but the games wern't as good. classic titles like super mario kart, star fox, and super mario64 became mario kart double dash(2 player karts?), star fox(an action/adventure game with dinosours? what happend to the great space shoot 'em up?) and super mario sunshine(classic goomba stomping coin-collecting becomes stopping polution?). if you want to have s 2 players per car battle, try halo for the xbox. nothing like two warthogs fighting when both the chain guns are blazing"
3,great and dissapointing at the same time!,"I finished 100% of this game and I gotta to say these things. It is the fastest mario kart game so far, but the contrulls feel weird at first, then you get used to it. It lacks the items that made mario 64 great and fun. It lacks the long bannana, purple shell (replaced by blue shell in MKDD) , golden mushroom and the triple shells are special items for only the koopas and they don't roll around you! But it still lacks alittle speed. It has some of the worst level designs like Baby park. It has a great rainbow road and tricky obsicles. Petey is the worst driver since the day of Billy Hatcher's release. Don't use PETEY!!! The grapichs are clean, shiny and weak. The Parade cart is the best cart in Mario kart double dash. Mario kart DS is goning to be way better than MKDD and MK64. overal it loses to the great mario kart 64!"
2,Archaic,"If you think Madden doesn't change, play this game. The one player competes with DOA for the title of most shallow. Where the hell is create-a-kart, a FULL career or something to give you something new to do. In terms of multiplayer, SO MUCH wasted potential. Where are the bots and level designs? Get diddy kong racing on the 64, trust me."
3,Double Trouble,"I couldn't agree more with potato_mike's comment about this game. It is a short game and would have lasted SO much longer if it was online.But that said, I do think the graphic's are brilliant. The whole two characters on one kart is a bit gimmicky (more then Eternal Darkness's sanity meter) but it's still a nice feature and you do get a sense of chaos.Nintendo have been making A LOT of short games lately. Luigi's Mansion, Pikmin, Sunshine, Zelda. Only Metroid Prime seems like a decent length and even that's a bit too short for my liking.I was really hoping Double Dash was going to be an online game. It would be the longest lasting game Nintendo's ever made. Oh well, hopefully they will learn from their mistakes.It's still a great game though. I love Mario and his lovely moustache!"
3,Mario Kart - a step back,"When i first heard about this game i was soooo excited about it. I love the n64 Kart and super circuit so i knew this game was gonna be good. Unfortunetly i was disappointed. The music is just not as good and the levels just aren't as good. Everything looks nice and the two person kart idea is nice, but one player gets old fast. Even battle mode just isnt as good. One good thing about the game is multiplayer race if you have access to 2 or more people who will play with you anytime then this is a buy. If you dont then its not even a rental"
2,Painfully terrible,"I've attempted on so many occasions to play this game and to force myself to like it. I CANNOT. The fun factor just isn't there for me. I sit there driving around bored the whole time. And then there's the music...WTF is with the ""music"" in this game!? Not only is it not good, it's actually BAD. It's downright annoying and painful like someone just randomly strung a bunch of notes together and called it a day. I honestly can't get over how terrible it is. There's also so much crap in the peripherals of the screen that you can barely see half the course! I wish they'd give you the option to turn that stuff OFF. The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is because some of the levels have nice graphics. But who cares! Anyone want to buy a used Double Dash game?"
3,Not Addicting,"This is a great game for about a month! Once you are stuck on something and no friends, then it gets boring. If you have lots of brothers and sisters, then buy this game(if they like it). If you're single, then rent it."
4,THIS GAME IS AWSOME!!!!!!!!!,This game is one of the best GCN games ever made. Never have i had so much fun playing a game since i played The Legend of Zelda: The Windwaker or Super Smash Bros. Melee. This is a must have game for any one and everyone who has a gamecube.The grafics are some of the best I've ever seen and the gameplay is awsome. It is the best party game. I play it all the time with my friends. You will not get bored playing this game.
4,Mario Kart is back for Gamecube!!!!!!!,"I do not know where to start. Well, this game is awesome and gameplay: A+ charecters: mario luigi walugi donkey kong and much more. 2 charecters per kart and on the go!graphics A+ Graphics and levels are Awesome.So buy this game no matter how many bad rewivs you read.Looking for a good racing game? Buy mario kart double dash!!!! This game is a must Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Best Racing Game Ever,"This game is very long and Hard. You will never get bored of it. You also get to unlock many characters, stages, and cars. To make a long Story, short you will be happy if you buy this game. Bye it for your kids or kids ask for it, they or you will be happy."
5,REALLY FUN,I GOT THIS GAME 3 YEARS AGO AND IT IS FUN. THIS GAME LETS YOU HAVE TWOCHARECTERS IN A KART AT ONCE. THE GAME HAS ABOUT 21 PEOPLE TO CHOSE FROM.I LIKE TO PICK FROM BABY MARIO AND BABY LUIGI.IT IS REALLY FUN
5,It's Mario Kart! How could it not be fun?!,"I have always been a big fan of mario kart so what can i say other than it is a great fun game. Not only that, if you have enought controlers then its fun for four people. Great fun! What more is there to say?"
5,Great fun!,"This has become my seven year old son's and my favorite game to play together, and all the kids in the neighborhood enjoy it, too. The races are cool and battle mode is even cooler. If I keep practicing, one of these days I might even win a race or a battle against him!"
5,One of my favorites,I don't play a whole lot of games but this one is one of my favorites. When Mario Kart came out a few friends and I stayed up pretty late over Thanksgiving weekend playing this game. It has been a year now and we're still not tired of it. We still haven't gotten the gold cup in all races either. Recommend for a group of friends who don't mind getting knocked around by red shells and exploding bombs. Not recommended if you have neighbors who like to sleep at 2 a.m. :-)
1,terrible,"ok, i wanted to like this game. i almost liked it for about 1 minute, and then it got sooooo boring. i was ready to return it after 5 minutes. PLEASE dont get this game if you dont like boredom."
1,Wrong game shipped,"I cannot submit a review since the seller sent the wrong game. Although I returned wrong game in plenty of time for ordered game to be put under Christmas tree, it did not happen. Took quite a few emails to get refund and wasn't refunded the return postage as promised. This caused me to order books from overstock.com rather than Amazon.com for birthday present."
4,AWESOME game to play on the Nintendo GameCube,"Mario Kart Double Dash is going to be a REALLY TOTAL AWESOME game to play***THIS IS A MUST HAVE GAME TO GET AND PLAY(GREAT GAME)***I give it 5 Stars ""Highly Recommended"" REALLY TOTAL WORTH IT TO BUY AND PLAY this game on the NINTENDO GAMECUBE"
1,Bad,Dont even rent Mario Kart: Double Dash. It is really boring. All the Mario Karts are the same. Im sick of Mario. He should die already. Dont buy it.
4,Double the FFUUNN!,"Reviewer:AdrielThis game is the most fun racing game!This beats the other MK games,new karts,characters,stages and lots of unlockables.Graphics:4/5Audio:4/5 a nice cartoon style audioGameplay:5/5 Soooooooo x 1,000,000 fun!replayability:play it over and over and over and over and over!Fustration:1/5BUY THIS!"
4,"It's Alright, worth the money","Overall, this game was pretty good, but the camera angles were really awful though. But, still the controls were easy to learn and the gameplay was good enough. I'd recommend this to people who have time on their hands (since it gets tiring) and it's good for any age."
4,Best Racing Game,Get this game if you want a racing game and you like Mario games! This is a very fun game that is better than the old Mario Kart for N64. There are a lot of different levels to race on.
4,Dear God,"This game is awesome beyond words. I was a little worried about battle, but its just as fun as the last ones for n64 and SNES. This game is a must have. Get it right now. Seriously, right now."
4,Great game but not worth the money,"We have this game and it is fun but it is not worth almost 50.00 i think it should be 15.00 the graphics are great and it has cool multi player modes but after awhile the same racing tracks get boring and the multi player games get old, overall this is a great game but if i were you I'd wait for the price to go down!"
1,Non-Readable Disc,Package came on time but the game cannot be read by my gamecube. There is a minor scratch on the disc and I'm assuming this is the issue. Pretty angry about this...
4,Mario Kart Rocks the House!!!,I think mario kart double dash is the best game in the world!I love the graphics and the characters! It feels like I'm driving a go-kart.
1,A Huge Disappointment,"Being a huge fan of the Super Nintendo and N64 versions I was sure to reserve a copy of this game when it came out.However, I soon discovered that while the tracks, graphics, and extras are great, the controls and driving engine are TERRIBLE.Racers familiar to the N64 version will feel like they are driving a school bus on ice when playing this game. The system of power sliding is completely ruined.Definitely rent this game first, and if you must buy it, at least do yourself a favor and play the N64 version so that you know what you're missing."
4,Pretty good racing game,"This is a pretty good racing game, controlling two characters in one kart is a really great idea! But, I wish there was a ""quick race"" option, that way I could just do a single race if I wished and didn't have to do Time Trail or Grand Prix. Still fun, just wish it had that one option. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,Great service,"I bought this game so me and my brother can face off time-to-time. when i got it, i put it in my Wii and it did not work. so i emailed the seller about it and he gave me a full refund."
4,Definitely worth buying,This book is great. It is a fun way for children to learn the Phonics and Rhyming concept. My daughter pulls this book out often -- and she feels such a sense of accomplishment when she gets it right.
2,slide show function useless,"I bought my DV-CP702 DVD Chnager about two years ago at suggestion of Best Buy salesman. Works well for DVD video but I have just tried to run a jpeg photo slide show and each picture is scanned line by line, Taking baout 30 seconds per picture. It's useless for jpeg slide shows that are claimed in the manual. A very inexpensive DVD player does a better job with this so I question quality control. I'll be very careful with my next Onkyo purchase."
4,hello,i will like to have more information about visual basic...i will like to have your program in my computer
2,Doesn't fit correctly,At first I thought this skin was perfect. After using for a few hours it tends to slip up about an eighth of an inch. This makes 1/8 inch of the screen covered and the control wheel is kinda hard to press play.In order to lock the controls I have to push the skin down awkwardly.I should have returned it when I had the chance.
2,"Good Quality, Extra Cost for Logo","These gloves are good quality, but no different than the ones you find at any discount department store for a fraction of the cost. The only difference is that the discount store gloves do not have the Mud logo on them, the material, build method and quality are virtually identical.So if I could, I'd rate these a 4/5 for quality and a 1/5 for value."
5,Nice product. Great colors.,These bands keep my hair out of my face and do a good job handling the sweat. And they come in a great assortment of colors. I'll be back for more because for some reason I can't find something as simple as a sweatband at any of my local sports supply stores.
1,it's only 1,I bought this because I thought it comes in a pack of 6. I only received 1. $3 plus $7 shipping is not worth it!
2,Uncomfortable feelings...,My kids weren't very interested in this toy. I thought it was cute at first but the shape of the microphone leaves the adults feeling very uncomfortable to touch it due to its shape. Do you see what I mean? Zoom on in!
5,Moon dreaming!!,"Nice Steering wheel cover! I thought it was going to be plastic, but instead it's a cloth like material.....Which is even better!Gives the steering wheel a whole different feel. It does take 2 STRONG people to put it on."
4,Alan Arkin 'owns' the Flagg Purdy reputation,"Quite a number of years ago, I think it was a Christmas special by Hallmark, we saw ""A Matter Of Principle"" starring Alan Arkin. What a movie. We loved it so much we bought several copies and gave some away to those we know would like it as a gift. After a while it became more than just a gift. We realized just what a 'teaching tool' the movie was... showing folks NOT to behave like Flagg, just on 'principle'.... and some folks really need to learn that lesson. This latest movie, while not quite as good as the first, is still well worth watching and projects the 'Flagg Purdy' character out there even further. Neither of these movies got much, if any, commentary (good or bad) or review. I think you'll like this one just fine."
3,Raising Flagg,"Ok flic... BUT, it is NOT a continuation of ""A Matter of Principal"". Family is different and characters are different. It could have been a much better movie if it had been done as a sequel."
3,minor but enjoyable comedy,"""Raising Flagg"" is a laid back, innocuous indie comedy about a cantankerous, attention-seeking old codger (delightfully played by Alan Arkin) and his run-ins with various members of his family and community.Preferring the appreciative chuckle to the full-throated guffaw, writer/director Neil Miller gently ribs his small town folk without once resorting to condescension or caricature to get the laugh. Arkin is nicely complemented by a cast of familiar and not-so-familiar faces (Austen Pendleton and Richard Kine being probably the most recognizable of the lot), while the Pacific Northwest setting provides a scenic backdrop for all the shenanigans."
2,This product isn't what I expected. The lubricant ...,"This product isn't what I expected. The lubricant does what it's meant to do, but it's messy. I don't think I'd purchase it. I was very disappointed. I feel that other similar products I know of are better. The price of this product is comparable to those, but the others would go much further."
2,stinky not slippery,i bought this with high hopes but it was complete disappointment. We kept having to reapply because it turned into a sticky glue feeling mess. I think we will stick with our astro glide!!
4,This product worked well. It provided extra lubrication ...,This product worked well. It provided extra lubrication without feeling greasy. It was easy to wash off.
4,This personal lubricant has no odor and is ...,This personal lubricant has no odor and is top notch in keeping me lubricated in times when I may need some help! It's water-based and long lasting. This was a great product to try. I like it better than another brand I've used because it doesn't have that greasy feeling. I'll definitely recommend this product to my friends and family!
1,A Big Waste of Money,"This video was very dissapointing. I was expecting a fairly high quality lesson from a fairly intelligent teacher. Boy was I wrong. Its filmed with a camcorder in some stoners garage. Hardly worth the twenty bucks I paid for it. One of the most annoying things is that he never tells you the names of songs so half the time you don't know what you're playing. And, it only teaches you short little licks that arent really too useful. I can't imagine anybody saying: ""Hey, I can play five seconds of a seven minute song! Cool!"" This guy isn't even a great guitarist. Many of the things he plays are innacurate, uses slides when none are used, and his timing is terrible. He's also a bad teacher. Personally, seeing someone play something, then seeing him play it again only closer and slower(again with bad timing)doesn't really teach me anything. Anyway, I think that you get the idea that this video is a piece of crap. So whatever you do, DON'T BUY THIS!!!"
1,It's terrible,"This tape is very low quality and has many notational errors. Curtis Mitchell shows you only a few licks of many different songs, leaving the player lost in learning the rest of the songs. Maybe if the viewer burnt a few 'bad ones', they could understand where Curtis is coming from. (I couldn't) Buy this video as a last resort to learning to plan Floydian music."
1,This is the worst video i have ever seen.,Curtis Mitchel speaks better that he can play. He shows only a few licks from the vast collection of Floyd songs and the licks that he shows are also not played like the original. They are played with the worst variation that Curt could probably think of. I am a beginer player with 5 years of playing strictly by ear and without technique or music theory and even i can copy Floyd songs better than what Curt plays in the video.
3,Hardly worth the money.,"This video does not do David Gilmour or Syd Barrett justice. While this video might show you some tricks you never knew, it does also contain many, many, MANY errors. I felt as though it did not help my technique at all."
1,It makes a good frisbee,"This one of the worst guitar style DVD's Have have ever bought.If you want to watch a thresher hack-up some floyd, then this is for you.If you want a really good DVD by the series from Lick Library, Jamie Humphries will get you through those tough string bends."
4,Good Value for the Money,"Some reviewers want a $10,000 education in a music tape...this is not it. But what's the value of the many, many hours you save to get the basics? The sound you make is up to you...this tape gets you started. I liked it, and I recommend it. My kids (8 & 9) liked it...I think they got a lot from it...probably because it simplifies a difficult subject."
4,Transition Complete,"At last John Foxx, with Louis Gordon makes the transistion between metal machine music and traditional music. Having flirted with the use of feedback, with Ultravox! with their final Lp ""Systems Of Romance"" Foxx matches, neigh surpases previous releases with the industrial ""The Noise"" the beatlesesque ""Shifting City"" and the breezy, ""An ocean we can Breathe"" All excellent and certainly worth the money, you'll not buy a better CD of this genre."
1,Worst Soccer Game Ever,"This game is terrible. The difference in difficulties is way too drastic, you either win 16-0 or every game is 0-0. Also when on offense you cannot manuver through tackles, either you avoid the defense or you don't score. If you like to look at pretty stadiums then buy this game if you want a good game go for Winning Elevin 6 or 7."
1,sucks,"this game sucks. it's so unrealistic. there are specific locations on the field and you know that 9 out of 10 times you are going to score from these locations. also after a member of your team passes the ball he stops for like a second; so if it was a bad pass and your opponent intercepts the ball, you cannot use that guy to get the ball back from him. there are so many small things like this that are so annoying. another example: you cannot go near the goalie when he is kicking the ball. And also the announcer's words are exactly the same as it was in FIFA 2003 which was terrible. I just wish that they really work on FIFA2005 and I really would like to see a FIFA Street game. That would be awesome."
2,Fifa 2003 was more of an improvement than Fifa 2004,"EA Sports completely ruined the Fifa series, apart from adding the new online gaming choice, it still doesn't change the fact that EA bringing out this shameful follow up to the previous greats can be congratulated. Overall, fifa 2004 has lost a total of 4.5 points from 10, but Fifa 2003 has lost just 1 point from 10.Graphics: 10Sound: 9Gameplay: 3.5Rosters: 5Improvment: 4Overall: 6.5So once again, this was a terrible comeback from EA. It was the worst in the Fifa series, the championship throphys are fake, there are no liscenced real tournaments, the career mode doesn't even give you a point after flawless playing and the rosters are not up to date and most of the top names from last years greatest Fifa edition are missing.This game sucked, so i recommend that you get Fifa 2003 instead of 2004."
1,not real soccer,"I dont like fifa very much because isn`t like a real soccer game, i like more winning eleven 7 or winning eleven 8 (japane version) winning eleven is best than fifa i alot of aspects expept in graphics"
2,Pretty Bad :-(,"Bad, bad, bad. Not worth the money. It seems that each edition of FIFA is worse than its predecessor. EA Sports should focus on game-play and graphics rather than on graphics alone. In FIFA 2004 the players are sluggish, the passes slow, and the off-the-ball command is horrible. On top of that, the online version of the game doesn't work properly. All together, I'd say that the release of FIFA 2004 was a big disappointment, which is very sad."
1,lets make it clear this game suxx,"Absolutely no gameplay and its also unrealistic. U cant even see the goalscoringleague. nobody would have bought this game if they hadnt have the licenz (real players, Match dresses). Buy Pro Evolution soccer 3 instead that is a real Footballgame"
2,EA FIFA 2004?!?,"FIFA has always had a more arcade like game-play to it. It's just with fifa 2003 that it's been trying to play more like real soccer. That said, I cant help but notice that FIFA looks like they're scrambling to catch up to Konomi's european WINNING ELEVEN series now that they finally made it available here in the USA. Unfortunatly, even though FIFA has all the nice flash, Winning Eleven 6 still has the substance! Now that Winning Eleven 7 is due out this month, and at a 10$ price difference, I see DOOM written all over the FIFA series!!!!"
4,they did a good job,this is a great game everybody thinks its a bad game but do not listen to them the graphics are great this is my favorate fifa! they have mast national teams the only thing i was mad about was that they did not have holland. overall its a great game!
3,"Yea Yea, one correction","Hey Jeff from Miami florida who wrote some review on FIFA 2004, one correction. This is not FIFA 2004 for PC were reviewing here, so i don know why youre talking about some Dell computer with so and so Ghz."
5,Calling all Soccer Fanatics,"... I've played soccer since I was 4 so understandably I know the game. FIFA, unlike other soccer systems, incorporates runs, give-and-goes, but mainly provides the best playability I've ever seen.It's VERY realistic from the chants to the camera angle. For the kids that like the action, hesitate to buy because the view is such that you can see a lot of the field. It enables you to get the full vision, and is quite an improvement over 2003.For those that have the online hook up this game will be a forerunner into a new age of soccer gaming. Grab the game and the online adapter, this game will be incredible."
4,Complete Rubbish,"Wish people would try games before writing reviews. This is an utter waste of 40 quid. So its got the licences but what about gameplay? The controls are so unresponsive I thought the cmputer was playing itself. Unforgiveable slow down at critical moments, replays that often show no ball (or players). It crashed twice within ten minutes. A career mode that lasts only 5 years. Eh?. Most British teams have been going for 50 - 100 yrs. And I can still beat Brazil 7-0 in the first half when I'm playing as Scotland. Is one star the minimum I can give?"
3,just above the bar...,"I waited, and waited for this game, I finallycollapsed and dropped 50$ American for it. Andthe conclusion... let down! Fifa 2003 was alright,it could have used sometweaking, but this game islike a complete step backwards. The game play isslow and the controls take some time to get used to.The tournament mode has no world cup,or iunternational cup;and the graphics are almost worst that in 2003.The 2003 graphics were pretty dope, but in this versiondudes with dreads just get long hair, that looks like onewaxy peice, and most players have the same face, andthe camera options arent as good as 2003.The game isnt horrible, but save your hard earned cashand buy winning 11."
4,Pretty Good!!!,"OK, i'm not one to jump on any bandwagon but I have to agree with alot of people in saying that KONOMI'S Winning Eleven series just beats out EA SPORTS and has the better footbol (or Futbol, that is) game. Thats not to say that Fifa should be easily passed by. I found the game actually pretty good and realistic to the game. The new controls are a little confusing and sometimes dont work in my opinion. Graphics are great as usual, and so is the sound. But Winning Eleven 6 just has the edge though with exciting quick matches, great on-the-pitch gameplay and endless options. Fifa 2004 is good but Winning Eleven comes out on top still."
4,Much improved.,"Since the last Fifa game, EA has improved the most important aspect which was the game play. The new controls to enable players off the ball to move and make runs add so much to the game. As a single player you can play like you were in a multi-player environment.Other points of improvement are the the realistic graphic details and the goal celebrations add so much realism to the game.As many other reviewers I use to own Winning Eleven, although Fifa 2004 has almost all the teams and players that I read about then can play them on the screen adds another dimension of realism to the game.Enjoy the game it is worth playing until the next version comes out."
4,Quality,Fifa 2004 is a game that is out of limit. It has all it is an incredible game. Believe me it is a great inversion.
1,Total Disappointment,"The gameplay is not what I anticipated. Especially with three of some of my favorite players in the world on the cover and with Madden '04 being better than Madden '03, i expected something better than at least any Fifa game before '03. I mean EA Sports could've came out with soccer game more fun to play. I guess I'll stick to '03 which is more user friendly."
1,"It deserve a 0.. a total dissapoint, Buy Winning Eleven 7!!!","What they produce it's not soccer!!!, I bought fifa 2004 just for the online play, (another disappointment the online gameplay) but just like others fifa's games, a complete dissapoint. It's seems like your game it's a merge of soccer and NFL, NOT soccer at all. Everyone who played real soccer... at least once in it's life, could tell you that fifa series it's not soccer, or it's what EA team think soccer it's.. or should be, but not way of play. Fifa have good grafics, but you don't feel the emotion of the soccer seen graphics, soccer it's passion, not graphics and tactics of NFL games. I won't purchase any fifa game ever!. See what Winning eleven 6 or 7 does, or Word tour soccer 2005 does whith the gameplay."
1,"Another year, another lame FIFA","and another attempt by EA to take our money wowing us with eye candy while trying to slip by us the fact that this is essentially the same garbage as last year. Off the ball control is unusable and a joke, there is no difference neither among players nor among teams, as you can take on Real Madrid with Yeovil and dominate, for example. Avoid and buy Winning Eleven 7 instead. It's coming out shortly and will blow this garbage out of the water."
1,Crap,"FIFA 2004 is garbage. I have played all fifa series since 97 and this is by far the worst. Who cares about graphics, chants, and real players if the game barely works. Garbage AI, terrible game play and crappy upgrades. People who like this game have never played Winning Eleven and probably dont really watch football. Dont buy this game it is a waste of money and time."
4,WHAT THE HELL ARE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT !!!,"I DO NOT KNOW WHY THIS GAME IS GETTING SO MUCH BAD REVIEWS BECAUSE FIFA IS ONLY GETTING BETTER AND BETTER, SURE I MISS THE CREATION CENTRE BECAUSE MY COUNTRY IS NOT IN THE GAME, ...I GOT PLENTY OF FRIENDS TO PLAY AGAINST IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD IT'S MORE FUN THIS WAY, DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY THIS GAME IS REALLY FUN AND HAS LOTS OF NEW FEATURES."
5,We are so very blessed...,"This game must be a gift from the heavens above. It is by far the best FIFA yet from the best sports game label (EA Sports.) With so many teams and leagues to choose from, itll never loose the gameplay. Managing your team from every aspect of the game is my favorite part of the game, but whats not to like. This futbol game is 10 times better than Winning Eleven 6, unless you like having way less teams and unrealistic gameplay. This game is a MUST for every soccer fan. This game brings you the closest you will ever be to ""Bending Like Beckham."" Peace."
1,save your money!!!,it did not work as discussed and to place people on hold you have push certain keys *# i think and that was very uncomfortable for clients...
5,Amarillo in August: An Author's Life on the Road,"Purchased Amarillo in August at the Border Book Festival in Mesilla, sat down that evening to read and finished it. That tells you everything. By page 8, I was thinking ""quirky, gutsy, and funny--with the emphasis on gutsy."""
2,I did not care for it at all; my least favorite of Krentz's,I did not like this story at all. It was a little too weird. The main male character was just a bit too much on the strange side.
1,Skip This One,"Jayne Ann Krentz has been one of my favorite romance writers for a while now - I read ""Flash"" and ""Eye of the Beholder"" over and over. ""Deep Waters"" was a big disappointment: Elias Winters was downright unbelievable, Charity Truitt seems like a poor replica of a character from one of Krentz's better novels, and the story was uninteresting - like me, you'll probably figure out ""who dunnit"" before anything gets done!"
4,No complaints,"I found this book to be very satisfying. It worked for me. One of the things I like about Krentz is that her characters are older and wiser. This story has humor and wit and wisdom. The characters have self-doubt and really seem to question what they want to do with the rest of their lives. Deep Waters is a feel good book that makes you think about your own life. Most romance thrillers do not relate to my life in any way. This book is not only entertaining, it is involving. The murder mystery plot is not nearly as important as the personal struggle Charity and Elias experience in trying to find peace and balance in their lives. It is not surprising that they find it together in the end, they take their time and build a mature relationship with layers (and good sex). Isn't that what romance is all about?"
2,"Slow at first,but fiery later on. Don't put it down",Charity and Elias are better for each other than they know. Maybe they're just in deep denial. Otis is funny too.
3,Briefly . . .,"I love Jayne Ann Krentz's novels, but this one was boring. There were a few amusing lines, however, a much better version of this book is her Midnight Jewels. Instead of Charity, you have Mercy running a book store. Instead of Elias, you have Croft who has cultivated his own martial arts technic. There are fewer characters but the action and the story fly faster and with far greater appeal."
5,"An ageless masterpiece, this is where it all was started!","If VODOU ADJAE by Boukman Eksperyans sound familiar now, it's only because hundreds of Haitain recordings that followed it were (and still are) trying to copy its style. Very few artist have occupied and captured the Haitain cultural consciousness like these artist have. Like rap's Public Enemy (""It Takes A Nation Of Millions""), Boogie Down Production (""Criminal Minded"" ""By All Means Necessary""), reggae's Bob Marley (singing about the life and the struggles of his peoples) and R&B legend Marvin Gaye, Boukman Eksperyans have change Haitain music forever. VODOU ADJAE is a flawless masterpiece that distills the myriad experiences of our (not just Hatains) daily lives into a collective unconsciousness of 50 minutes of aural perfection. Without any doubt, this classic is one bright creation that will continue to shine long after the other albums of its time fade."
4,A clear military/political history of the First World War,"This is a clear, readable textbook that covers the background of the war, wartime developments on all fronts, and the aftermath of the war. The focus is almost entirely on Europe; there is one chapter on the war outside Europe, but little attention otherwise to the involvement of non-Europeans (primarily via colonial empires) in the war effort. The focus is political and military, with occasional discussion of economic matters. There is little social and no cultural history--for those topics, look elsewhere. The maps are clear (though I would prefer more of them), and there are some photos--though for the price of this book, I would have expected more illustrations. It has a list of recommended reading and takes account of a good deal of recent research. The writing isn't gripping--it is a textbook, after all--but it's clear. Section headings help readers keep track of major trends."
2,"same games, different titles",Most of the games are the exact same thing only different titles and themese are used. It is difficult to do many of the activities with numerous children.
4,201 Games for Elem. P.E.,I had first checked this book out from our library. After going through it I deceided to order a copy for myself. I found that it provided a nice varitey of games. Some of the games lent themselves to being modified to fit my needs. Most of them I will use just they way they are. I'm looking forward to trying them out.
2,"I used to buy only these for years, but then...","but then I saw a consumer reports ad in my mail that wanted me to buy the magazine. It included their review of facial tissue.They said that the strongest tissue they came upon was Puffs Plus.On nasal ettiquite:I am a honker. Being as such I always had to fold these Kleenex in half so that they didn't blow a hole through them.I decided to try the stronger puffs and they really are. I don't need to fold them and they don't blow through. That said they are also more expensive than this product. I now buy both. I put Puffs Plus on my side of the bed for me, and the Kleenex throughout the house for everyone else.*****Final Thoughts*****Kleenex is a less expensive product if you go through a lot of facial tissue. Puffs Plus is stronger if you need that sort of thing."
4,"These tissues had that extra smoothness, which I ...","These tissues had that extra smoothness, which I can feel on my skin. The two-ply is good, because it prevents them from tearing while using. The better choice of all tissues."
4,Entertaining,"I thought Boystown was entertaining, got several laughs. Alot of memerable lines especially in the party scene. Made me think of Sordid lives, low budget but entertaining. The landscaper can do my yard anytime he wants!"
4,"Ok, I am interested, to a point....","A new Gay show. After QAF, I needed something to fill the void...This episode caught my attention. But the episode is a little raw and needs to be ""spiked"" up a little. I was slightly disappointed. The characters were briefly introduced and the story line was limited. I gave it 4 stars because even though this episode is raw, I feel it has potential. In my opinion, they have my attention with the plot. But the story line is a little weak. I think they need to introduce the characters more.Will I get more episodes, most likely. Even though this first episode was weak, I would like to find out what happens....Its not for the QAF fans though. This show is different. Definitely a work in progress."
3,Really cute sandal but.....,"....the rubber flowers poked some pretty mean holes in the top of my feet! I bought these sandals several months ago and hadn't worn them until going on a cruise last month. At first they felt fine; very comfortable and lightweight. But after the first day I noticed marks on the top of my feet which I just thought were little bruises from the rubbing of the flower tips. Later the next day, the tops of me feet were a little sensitive. That's when I noticed that the flowers had worn holes on my feet. I had read in a previous review (on a different website)that someone else had the same problem but after I received them and saw that they were just rubber flowers, didn't think that they would be a problem.They really are cute sandals so I will probably have to make some adjustments to the rubber flowers before I wear them again."
3,Red Food Color,"We bought this to use as hummingbird sugar color. It might be great in Christmas cookies, but not for hummingbird food. It stained everything, and was very difficult to remove the stain. So, our fault for using it the wrong way."
2,Six months and no more energy,I think that Rainbow Light is a quality company however after taking this product for 6 months I can honestly say I have not one iota more energy and in fact if I do not take it I feel the same!
3,No difference....,"I honestly think that the quality of a Men's Multi can best be summed up with the answer to a simple question. Do I feel any better? Yes or No? My answer is No. I can tell it is working by my urine stream being very dark yellow (excess is being passed from the kidneys). However, do I feel more energetic? No. Do I feel better mentally? No. Are they working? Who knows. We all die in the end. I figure they are better than nothing at all and take them."
2,Not Strong enough...,"I been looking for some good vitamins that can provide me with a good amount of energy. Before these, I tried mega men from GNC and also Ultimate Man from theVitamin shop. Since Amazon sells almost everything I decided to shop online and try these based on the reviews here. Sorry to have to knock the rating down on these but, been using these for a couple of months, and I have never felt more tired....I sleep 7 hrs a night if Im lucky, wake up early to head to college by 7:20 AM- stay there from 7-12PM- At 12 I play basketball from 12-1:40, then back to a final class for the day that ends at 2:30. I get home around 3PM, and by 8-:9 Im already feeling ""TIRED"" I also start feeling less then one hundred percent by midday(ie sort of groggy).Don't know what it is, but the ones I took before these were the new Vitamin SHop Mens Gold vitamins and they didn't make me feel this tired.This is not a technical write up but just a general heads up for those very active."
4,Rainbow Light Just 1 - Once Naturals Mens One Energy,"This is the third bottle of Rainbow Light I am using and for the most part, I have been satisfied. Unfortunately, another product was recently recommended by a friend that has proven itself to be even better. After 4 days of use, my energy level was up and over all, I truly felt renewed vigor over and above how I felt with Rainbow Light. Sorry to have to report this, because I truly believe Rainbow Light is an excellent product.The new product is Intra Max made by Drucker Labs of Texas. This liquid, all natural tonic, is green and tastes a lot like Mango, one of my favorite flavors, so it is very enjoyable to take."
5,Exactly what I thougt it would be,I have purchased this product elsewhere for a lot more money. I was very happy to see that this was the same product.
3,Not a bad multi - not as good as Alive!,"Rainbow Light has a great philosophy for their supplements. There is an advisory board that has both medical doctors and master herbalists on it. Rainbow light will not put any ingredient in their supplements unless the entire advisory board agrees that it needs to be added. Any time you have a combination of Naturalistic and Allopathic approaches to supplements, you have a recipe for success.that being said, I feel that Nature's Way Alive! Men's Multi seems to work a little better for my body. All I can say is try it and see what you think, but give it 2-3 weeks of taking every day before you decide if it's worth it or not."
1,Research Selenium:,"""People who took as little as 200 mcg of selenium per day for more than 7 years had a significantly higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.""Source: [...]Follow us: @UMMC on Twitter | MedCenter on Facebook"
5,Purchased for hubby,"I was searching for a Vegan supplement for myself, and purchased Rainbow Light Men's One ""Just 1 Once"" Food-Based Multivitamin for my husband. These are food based, no preservatives or dyes, natural E instead of synthetic (which is hard to locate), and has the VeganGuard sign, so I'm happy to avoid animal products as well. He loves this vitamin and reports more energy than with other brands we used to purchase at the store. Will re-order again."
3,Nothing special,"I'm about to finish the first bottle. I did not feel any changes (more energy, etc) once I started taking them. I noticed that the color of the last few pills in the bottle is darker, maybe because of the exposure to air everytime the bottle is opened. I think I will try a different brand next time."
5,Definately beats those One-A-Day vitamins.,"After trying to put up with the locally available drug store One-A-Day vitamins I must say these vitamins are a god-send! One-A-Day vitamins would cause me to feel dizzy and slightly hurt my stomach while making me nauseated all day long. It would not matter if I ate a big meal before taking it or otherwise I would always have this difficulties. These vitamins however are true to their claims, they can indeed in my case anyways be taken with or without food and definitely ensure get you the nutrients you need in your daily diet."
4,First vitamin - quite satisfied,"I don't take vitamins on a regular basis, nor have I in the past, so I can't compare these vitamins to other products.I felt strange the first few days I took them, but since then, I have had a bit more energy throughout the day, and feel less 'run down'."
4,Great vitamins,"Not much else I can say. I will note that they are supposed to be gentle on your stomach, but i get sick if I don't take it with food. That might just be my sensitive stomach and not the pills fault. Not a big deal since I usually take it at night after dinner. I do appreciate the all natural aspect of the pills. The price on amazon is fantastic (as it almost always is)."
2,Disappointed,I wish I had purchased a small bottle instead of 150. I hate the smell . . . trying to figure out a way to get them ingested each day without smelling them. Purchased them because they are not suppose to upset your stomach . . . not true . . . I can count on an upset stomach about half the time. Will not get them again once they are finished. And I am sure no one wants to hear about the yellow urine!
3,HORRIBLE smell and taste- beware if you're sensitive,It's too soon to speak to whether or not this product is doing me any good_ but i can warn you that it smells bad and tastes worse. it's on the large size as well_ it's about as long as 2 aspirin tablets in length and almost as thick as 2 aspirin tablets stacked and a little bit wider than an aspirin. if you're delicate/sensitive to scent and taste you might want to stay away from this brand- i also ordered their 'Rejuvenage 40+' multivitamin and it also smells bad and taste worse- so i'm guessing everything this brand makes will smell bad and taste worse- and if it doesn't say 'mini' or 'small' in regards to size- it's probably gonna be a large pill to swallow. their 'rejuvenage' was even bigger than this pill- this pill would have fit inside the 'rejuvenage' pill.
2,They don't give me energy,"I think these vitamins are really doing their job, because (and sorry if this is TMI) when I urinate after taking these vitamins, the urine is a bright neon yellow, which means that your body has been able to absorb nutrients. The only letdown is that these vitamins do NOT give me energy like they say they do.UPDATE: I don't know if the formula has changed or what, but with the most recent bottle I bought, each time I take these vitamins I feel EXHAUSTED within about an hour. These vitamins never did give my energy like it claims, but for them to make me exhausted now is just ridiculous. I've tried just taking them at bedtime, but even then I feel groggy in the morning. I hate to throw out the remaining vitamins but each time I take them I'm wiped out and I've had enough. I will not be buying them again. And if you think it's ""all in my head"", read some of the other 1 and 2 star reviews that say the same thing."
3,Good Product - except for the smell,"The vitamins have great ratings and I guess they are good (too soon to feel any difference). My only complaint is the smell. I know a lot of the better vitamins have an odor, but this one seems exceptionally strong."
2,Made me nausea,Most vitamins and meds don't mess up my stomach. The only way this didn't mess up my stomach was if I was completely full. A glass of milk or a small breakfast wasn't ever enough. I was disappointed since I thought this brand was geared toward being easy on your stomach. Their prenatal vitamins were good but not these.
4,All natural and mostly complete,"Overall, I like this vitamin. I like it being natural and it has a host of ingredients a lot of others leave out. Like mentioned elsewhere though, don't take it on an empty stomach. I've learned to take it after eating my breakfast. It also doesn't taste very good and is a big pill, but that's all right. It's a small price to pay for a 100% natural product."
1,Kidney Stones,"I have had kidney stones in the past, but haven't had any in over a year. After using this product, I have had a small one, a big one, and I am currently working on another that doesn't want to come out. This multi vitamin is the only thing that I have changed in my diet. If you have ever had kidney stones, you should stay away from this product."
5,Feel a lot better on this vitamin,I had been taking a Centrum multivitamin for what seems like forever. I never really knew if it was working or not. I can honestly say I feel a lot better taking this vitamin.
4,"One of the few multi's with natural, not synthetic, E","It's getting harder to find a multi with d-alpha instead of dl-alpha.This one has d-alpha, not the synthetic E."
4,One a day,Love the one a day vitamin. I saw they have an organic version which I am thinking about trying next. I don't like taking a bunch of pills and feel a mild boost of energy and clarity when I take these in the morning. Been taking them for years and will keep doing so as long as nothing better comes along.
2,doesn't dissolve,"This vitamin looks really great on paper, but when I got it home, it didn't seem to stack up. I tried the dissolve test mentioned in another review. After a full hour in vinegar at ~100 deg F, the pill was not fully dissolved. It seems like I'll need to take 2 a day to get the full benefit of this pill. I have emailed Rainbow Light about it. I will update my review if they do anything to remedy the dissolving problems."
3,This is for men,"Awesome product. Though it says to take 3 pills a day that is really not needed. One pill a day is good enough to keep your diet balanced. So if you are on a diet and you are missing a bunch of other nutrition values then this is the right stuff for you. This is for men, not women! There is a different type of product for women."
2,Made my husband throw up...,"Twice. That's how we know it's them. Could be from the heat during transport since they are whole food vitamins. If so, we always pay more now to get probiotics and vitamins that have been kept cold during transit. Gave it two stars for their attempt at whole food vitamin and that I don't know if heat had to do with the situation. I believe we ordered them twice, though, and he always complained about an upset stomach before the episode."
5,FanFreakingTastic,Has everything you want in an all-natural multivitamin- but ALSO more! It even had the mood booster 5HTP which is a major plus.I will definitely be a regular buyer (:
2,Hard to Follow,"I was very disappointed with this film. I had watched it immediately after coming back from a wonderful trip to New Orleans and was desiring something that would remind me of New Orleans. The acting in this movie was mediocre. What really made this movie not very enjoyable was the fact that the storyline was very hard to follow. Most murder mysteries are supposed to have their share of twists and turns, however this movie went way beyond that to the point of complete confusion. I gave this movie a 2 star rating because at least the New Orleans backdrop and the Cajun Zydeco music was nice."
5,EXCEPTIONALLY APPEALING,"The Big Easy is a romantic and humorous melodrama.The players (a family of cops) are involved in mostly petty police corruption, the district attorney (Helen Barkin) investigates as fresh murders are being credited to rival gang turf battles. As the murders get closer and closer, the suspense leads to an action packed climax and some surprises.This film is set in New Orleans in the Cajun tradition and definitely worth the price."
1,MPAA - Give us a break!,"This is a favorite midnight movie for my 30something generation. Problem is, this is only half the film it ought to be. There is an alternate version (which you might be able to track down if you have relatives living in Greece) which is a WHOLE LOT BETTER.Dennis Quaid and Ellen Barkin have a relationship that you care about, several odd continuity glitches suddenly make sense (once you realise what they had to cut out).DVD was made for putting movies that got hacked apart back together. Even if the missing parts just get offered as 'EXTRA MISSING SEQUENCES', they ought to be there - especially for Zone One."
4,"""Just relax, darlin'. This is the Big Easy. Folks have a certain way o' doin' things down here.""","""The Big Easy"" (1987) directed by Jim McBride is a very sexy thriller/neo noir -southern style. I always wanted to visit New Orleans and The Big Easy, ""where they do things differently"" and its Cajun music are the stars of the movie. Two hot and talented actors (Dennis Quaid at his sexiest) as Det. Remy McSwain, of New Orleans Homicide and criminally underrated Ellen Barkin (Ann Osborne, a beautiful attorney from the D.A.'s office investigating corruption charges against Remy) are incredibly believable in their erotic scenes that make the film deservingly famous. Ned Beatty, John Goodman, and Grace Zabriskie are the part of the first-rate cast in this very decent even if predictable Crime / Action / Thriller / Mystery /Romance"
3,easy movie,"While not a classic or a great movie, you will enjoy this one. The casting is good and Quaid and Barkin make a believable couple and the plot works for them. And although there are many cop movies this one pops out due to the good atmosphere and the couple's chemistry."
3,A little Nostalgia,"My girlfriend thought highly of this film. So for Christmas, I got it for her.The story is kind of hokey, and the acting is a little subpar, but being a fan of the city of New Orleans... I couldn't help but be anamored of the way they use the city and the fantastic coordination of the soundtrack... enhancing the overall feeling of things.Dennis Quaid has been better, but he's fun to watch, as a young detective who comes face-to-face with the true meaning of graft and corruption.I like the overall feeling of the film. I love the town and the state of Louisiana... how every day seems like a party and the simplicity of the hours.Maybe the film wasn't great... but it is a great reminder of the days I spent in Louisiana last year and how much I want to go back!!!ArkangelTraven8@hotmail.com"
3,O.K.,"An o.k. movie that suffers a bit from being a bit too ""1980's"". Plot gets a bit muddled.Rental only."
3,IT WAS OKAY...BUT,"I'm not really a great fan of Dennis Quade, but his performance was pretty good in this movie, the story was suspensive and still well done..."
4,Holds up over time,"I watched this movie years ago and wanted a good movie to relax with. The Big Easy was as good as I remembered it to be. Dennis Quaid was in his prime and was very sexy. He and Ellen Barkin had very steamy scenes together. The plot was convincing and the supporting actors (Ned Beatty, John Goodman) did their usual wonderful job."
3,This film needs a Director's Cut DVD version,"There is one version of this film which puts near-contemporary 'Body Heat' to shame for plotting, action and the amazing sensual rapport between the two main players.Sadly, this DVD version has about ten minutes of cuts, compared to the full version.There really is no excuse for this; since one of the main selling points of the DVD format has been that it includes material excised from (some) theatrical and video release versions.We did it for 'Blade Runner'; we can do it here.The campaign starts now."
4,Not Quite So Big As I Remember,"I used to have this on VHS and adored it- it's a terrific film, with an unbeatable combination of twisty plot, stars that have incredible chemistry, and spicy music.... and yet when I watch it on DVD I find five minutes of the ending has just disappeared into the great old void at the editing room.Does anyone know why this part has been cut? It doesn't seem to make much sense, as without it, the conclusion of the film is very abrupt and disjointed... it's amazing the difference that one tiny little scene makes!Don't give up your VHS copy just yet- not until those editors find that damn five minutes and put 'em back in where they belong!"
5,Laissez bon temps roulez!,"You are immediately drawn into the undercurrent of what makes N'Awlins tick as you pop this movie into your VCR. From the instant they appear on screen together, Quaid and Barkin are on fire. This crime caper definitely has ""lagniappe"" . . . a little something extra for everyone! Not only action, there's the hot romance and humor. Ned Beatty takes a fine part in this film as well. Quaid, as Remy, has ruined me for everything else he's done since. I look for Remy every time I return to the Big Easy!"
3,Good Story but the Surround Sound effects don't hold up,Liked the story and the acting was good. Video quality was of couse perfect with DVD but the normally expected surround sound effects and stereo just didn't hold up. Almost mono with most sound coming from the center speaker. Suggest this movie for content but it's no Top Gun or Twister for audiofiles.
2,Unhappy with purchase; The Big Easy dvd,I bought The Big Easy dvd. It was new and when I tried to play it (tried on three separate dvd units) I could not get rid of the sub-titles. The sub-titles made it unwatchable. I tried to change the settings but nothing got rid of the subtitles.
3,Great soundtrack wasted!,"Since it had been quite a few years since viewing The Big Easy, I could not remember the story to well. What I could remember though was what a great cajun soundtrack this movie has. When I purchased this DVD I did not pay attention to the soundtrack presentation since I was looking forward to the movie. When arriving home I inspected the box further to notice the movie was presented in mono. The Big Easy was released in 1986 not 1936! How Trimark could not release this movie in at least a pro logic format is beyond me. The story is still a good one. It is just to bad the best aspect of the movie is wasted. BT"
3,A must see,"You have to see this movie if you like Dennis Quaid. I do have to say that being from New Orleans the way he talk is a little too much, but I can't help but love Dennis in this movie."
5,Good,"Great present for my dad who just liked one song, but got it all. Hope others find this review helpful."
4,Classic oldie.,"My favorite Dennis Quaid character! He is a charmer, but there is a dark side to the story. Very enjoyable to watch, keeps you guessing who the good guys might be."
4,Boring at First.,The Knights of the silver dragon goto val sage's to explore all the fun ofknife twirlers mermaid shows and muchmore Untill They have A fortune tellerread there palms then they travelback down into the dungons ofDoom and find out secrets And more!It was really boring at first butonce you get to about thetwelveth chapter it gets A lot better.
5,great,"im related to the lees on the maternal side,I have read a great many books on the lees.this little known inexpensive bookturns out to be one of the better ones.buy it.I bought this on amazon."
5,The Lees Of Virginia: Seven Generations of an American Family,The Lees genealogy is very good and their history is outstanding. I was very happy to receive this book for my personal library collection. Others who like history should read this book. And those who have Lees in their genealogy should also read this book. Thank You.Karen Kay Ullom
2,Not a very well researched source,"I was quite disappointed in this book when it arrived. It states that Richard the Immigrant had a son William, aka Col. William C. Lee, that never married. Not true. He married Alice Felton in 1675 in Manchester, Hillsborough, New Hampshire, and had four children. 1) Richard Lee born abt. 1677 at Surry Co., VA. 2) Mary Lee 3) William Lee 4) John Lee. Our family comes from Richard Lee, son of Col. William C. Lee and Alice Felton. This information comes from multiple sources with slightly differing data, so it is not from all a single source, and easy to obtain. Alice died in 1675, and is possibly the daughter of Thomas Felton. I had hoped the history of the Lees of Virginia in this book is researched better than this, but maybe not. I probably will not trust it entirely. I certainly hope the rest of the history of the Lees is accurate in this book.Other sources state two other wives for William C. Lee as Ann and Mary. No children listed with those."
2,Thought provoking but too speculative,"This book may well be valuable to those with a keen interest in Julian of Norwich - provided it is not the first, or the only, work on the topic which they consult. All that is known certainly of Julian's life is that contained in her books, and Kenneth Leech, perhaps in an attempt to relate her work to the 20th century conditions, is rather too speculative. (Perhaps, once upon a time, it seemed important for some to believe Julian had been a Benedictine nun - but is it so important, now, that she had to have been a married lady? The fact is that we do not know even her true name.)Best not to place this on the shelf of anyone with an interest in Julian, unless it is one of at least five works."
4,I thought it was good!,"This DVD shows you most of Sweet Home Alabama and portions of other songs. Curt focuses on the harder-to-figure out stuff in most cases (Check his Van Halen DVD).I don't think these DVDs promise complete songs, but techniques instead. Basic chord progression can be found on the web at free tab sites. Also, for the money, he gives a fair amount of info regarding technique, sounds, equipment, and licks. These CDs complement other sources and are for more intermediate players. I own several, have found them useful, and would recommend them, while keeping the above information in mind. Rock On!"
4,Just what I needed!! LOL,I had been swimming all summer and was having a terrible time with the water going up my nose and down my throat. I wore this and that stopped. I may not get to use it much more this summer but it will be used on a daily basis next year. (The ONLY reason it did not get a 5***** is because it did not have the little case to pack it away.) I have Primary Progressive MS and the swimming is awesome. Fast shipping! THAK YOU!!!
1,GREAT SHOW - HORRIBLE MARKETING,I love this show. It is clever and very adult - a great addition to the DC family.BUT! I am NOT going to pay $34 total for all three sets just to have Season One!!!!!Seriously people?? Hold out and wait for better packaging and don't buy into this extortion.
4,Did the job,"This bag is big! It fit my snap n' go without any problems. It's a bit bulky, but I was able to fold it up and put it in the basket on my stroller. I went on a round trip, non stop flight with no problems. I did take the strap off and store it in the side pocket as recommended by other reviews. No issues yet"
4,Huge and Relatively Sturdy,"I've used this when we fly to put my daughters stroller in. I have been able to put a BOB stroller in (taking off the front wheel) as well as additional baby supplies like a bumbo chair, diapers etc and still had plenty of room inside. It could be made a of a little thicker material to make it more sturdy, but overall we have been happy with it."
4,Fits ZOOPER Waltz,"Huge bag, lots of room and then some! However when wrestling with it at the gate check that extra room made it much easier to quickly get the stroller in/out! The material is very thin and we had some poked holes in it by the end of the trip due to the gate checking. It served its purpose which of course was to protect our stroller.BTW: we used a stroller for our toddler to and from the gate. We kept this bag folded up under the diaper bag in our stoller and whipped it out as needed. We used a personal hand cart (with bungies) to roll our carseat to and from the plane (along with a few of our carry on bags!). NEVER check your carseat at the gate/anywhere. You don't know what happens to it and how the integrity of the seat may or may not get comprimised... (Besides if you are going to lug it all the way to your destination why wouldn't you just use it?)"
4,Great Option for BOB Stroller,"I purchased this bag to gatecheck my BOB stroller. It fit perfectly in the bottom storage compartment of the BOB. My husband and I were able to place the BOB stroller in the bag in under 5 minutes. Also, we only had to remove the front wheel for the stroller to fit in the bag. I can imagine that it might be difficult for one person to fold the stroller and place it in the bag while also dealing with a child.It survived a direct roundtrip flight from IAH to RDU and protected the stroller perfectly. There are no signs of wear or tear on the bag. I will definitely use it again on any future flight travels."
4,Bulky but does the job.,"This is a HUGE, heavy duty, black stroller travel bag which does the job it's meant to do; however, with a baby in tow it requires two persons to properly place the stroller inside the bag and close the zipper. There's room around the stroller to add other items if you don't mind the items coming into contact with dirty stroller wheels. I'd recommend this only for full size strollers and not for umbrella-type strollers; you can probably easily fit two umbrella-type strollers inside this very large bag. It offers very good protection for the stroller and cuts down on the possibility of contamination."
4,Worked well,"Once we figured how to get it all to fit, we were able to get our snap n go stroller, infant carrier/car seat and the car seat base. It would be nice if it had a little more structure but worked well."
2,"Ok for the price, but....",This bag did not last one leg of a trip from CA to HI though it got my expensive stroller there in one piece (so I guess it did its job). There are tears and rips which I have tried to patch but more come each time I use. Thank god it did not cost me as much as the stroller in it but it wasn't free either - hence 2 stars.
4,Big Bag,"This bag fits our Keyfit carseat and our Chicco umbrella stroller, which is nice because you don't have to pay for it when you check it! Wish the bag was padded but it is good otherwise."
4,"A little tight, but works pretty good.","I bought this because our brand new car has a light colored interior, and I didn't want the junk from the street getting all over it after we used our stroller. It's essentially a canvas bag with a zipper on top, which means that the sides don't stand up on their own. Also, our Graco stroller is a bit tight in it, and it takes some work to get in in the bag. All in all, though, it gets the job done."
4,Does what it is supposed to do,"+-We ordered this bag to use with our Britax B Agile on our first family flight to Atlanta. The bag provided plenty of space for the stroller and even a few blankets :)The stroller survived unscathed, and the bag held up nicely on both flightsMy only wish is that it folded up better, but that is a minor issue. Bag does what is says it will do."
1,A hole after one flight,Very disappointed with this bag! I got this for my 10 month old's stroller for a family trip to FL. On the very first flight down there was already a hole in the bottom o the bag. I'm hoping I can get my money back... What a waste!
2,Not for air travel,"I got this for use to hold the stroller on the airplane. The zipper was messed up when I opened the package. The other zipper still worked, so no worries. We packed the stroller in it and checked it. One round trip flight and the bag had a hole in the back of it. I do not recommend it for airline travel."
2,Not Good on a Full Flight!,"This bag seemed like the perfect solution to protecting or Graco Quattro Single, but it failed the durability test. We took a packed flight to Hawaii from Chicago (10hr flight) and when we arrived our stroller and bag had a 5 inch cut in them. The stroller was clean though. They said because it was a full flight and lots of luggage the friction of the luggage moving against the bad is probably what happened. I would not reccommend this bag if you plan on traveling on a long packed flight."
2,Too small,This bag barely fit our Chicco Cortina stroller. Each time it had to be muscled in and the zipper barely closed after much pushing and pulling.
5,Great For Travel,"We got this for our cruise and it worked great. It was very easy to carry and load onto the train, bus, and car when it was needed. The material is very think and easy to wipe off if it gets dirty."
5,OhMyWoW,"This bag is much bigger than expected, I don't wear shoes in my house so of course a stroller used outside is no exception. This bag will store my Graco literider perfectly, and then some. Even my mother inlaw (who hates everything) loved this bag."
4,"nice protection, a little bulky","good protection offered to the stroller, it especially didn't get dirty. it's just a little bulky however."
2,ok but not great,Our graco duoglider just barely fit into this bag with no room to spare. It worked for what we needed but the bag had small rips after the first leg of our trip and the zipper is pretty cheaply made and broke on the second leg- probably because it was strained by the stroller barely fitting. The rips can be easily patched and the zipper fixed but for $25 I feel like it should have made it through at least one whole trip intact...
5,Great Suspense Read,"Megan's Island has many suspenseful elements going for it all throughout the book. Megan & her brother, Sandy, wonder why the family has to move so often. Why does Mom seem worried and frightened at times? What really happened to the father they never knew? Why does Mom suddenly pack them up right before summer vacation forcing them to miss the last days of school?When Sandy and Megan arrive at their grandfather's cabin on the lake, there are other puzzling mysteries to solve, as well as summer fun to look forward to. The read is introduced to several great characters who offer a lot to the story, as well as to some very shady suspicious characters. All is not what it seems at the lake.Read this great story if you are a fan of mystery. You will not be disapointed. Megan's Island won the very prestigous Edgar Allan Poe Award for children's mystery. The award was totally deserved. Mr Roberts has a way of leaving each chapter with a cliffhanger. I could not put the book down."
5,The best.,"I wouldnt even know where to begin with this record. The fact that this is out of print blows my mind. I have my cd (with a backup copy) but everyone should have this. Recorded on NYE 78/79 in Washington DC, Danny is at his prime. Buddy Emmons playing peddal steel is phenomenal. Their version of ""Song of India"" will always be my all time favorite live piece of music. Seek this one out, people!"
2,"Good lord, this sucks","When I rented Disney's Hide and Sneak, I wasn't expecting much. However, I did not expect it to suck this much.The first problem you will probably notice is how boring the gameplay is. There are a few puzzles that a braindead person could beat, and there are stealth parts that nobody can lose at.The only good thing I can say about this game is that the graphics and sound is OK."
5,"as always, excellent acting",We just cannot get enough of Midsomer Muders. Truly the best detective show on television. I would recommend this program to anyone that enjoys good television.
4,This continues the series with little variation.,"Great series, but getting a bit tired of John Nettles and I am anxious for the newer series with his replacement."
5,Midsomer enjoyment,Like always the midsomer murder mysteries is out standing. BUT! The price for two discs and only 4 cases was a bit on the expensive side. I have the first year and you received a lot more discs and cases. It seems that the longer the series goes on the least you receive. The prices need to be cut back!
5,Another great in the series.,"If you've seen the previous episodes, this is a wonderful addition and continuation. The Brits can really make quality entertainment, and still do."
4,"Set 18, Midsomer Murders","Received the item (Set 18, Midsomer Murders) on time and in good condition. However, for only three episodes, I thought it was a little pricey. For the money, I would have been happier if there were four or five episodes."
4,LONG LIVE MIDSOMER,"Set 18 of Midsomer is pretty good overall,the end is near for are star John Nettles,he will move on to other things in the future,but right now he still has cases to solve.My favorite one in this set is The Creeper a rich family has a lot of complications as in maybe someone is not the father of his children,also a masked person is breaking into houses for unknown reasons,and they break into Barnaby's house too,murder and mystery abound in this episode.The Great and the Good has a teaher somehow involved in a murder or two with some strange things going on,mystery fans will figure it out fast.Small Mercies has a tiny town in the middle of a big town and a murder which will baffle you,Barnaby and Jones soon figure out the tiny town murder,Midsomer comes through again so enjoy."
5,More British Mysteries,We love the Midsomer Murders mysteries. We ar hoping to one day have the complete set. This one brings one step closer.
3,lavender lotion,smells good..love the way it does not dry up..but i wish the lotion was thicker more like creme..i wish it was a warmer lotion..its a bit too cold to rub on ur hands before applying on ur clients back..
1,expired products being sent out.,"This review also has to do with the company ""Plus samples"". I have ordered this product 2x within the last year and the 1st time was near expiration, the 2nd time, the product had already been expired before reaching my healthcare center. Although they said it was an issue with soothing touch, I believe any company being a distributor should look at the expiration dates prior to sending them off to buyers. I will not use amazon or plus samples in the future for this product."
5,Great CD,"People will say that this isnt punk rock, and while it may not be, who cares? Everyone has different musical taste, and just because you dont like it doesnt mean other people cant. Whatever Blink-182 is (music genre-wise), I love all of their music. Now on to the review. Great song-writing, Great instruments, Great vocals (Tom can get kind of annoying after a while...). Overall great CD: Stand out tracks: Pathetic, Dammit, Waggy, Untitled, Apple Shampoo, Emo, Josie, and A New Hope."
5,IT is really good,"This is a better album/cd than their new one, ENAMa OF THE STATE. ON this cd they sound good, punkish, there new cd sounds like junk, its just for TRL MTV< its not them normal selves, but on this album there great."
5,The older the better,"I bought Enema of the state first after hearing it at my friends house. I loved it. Very fast, Blink-182 became my favorite band. I then bought The Mark, Tom & Travis show, and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket. I was afraid to buy Dude Ranch becuase they were younger and i thought they would just sound like a garage band. I listend to the CD and its the totally opposite. Its great. Its the real stuff. The next one on my list is Cheshire Cat. I totally recommend this CD for any one who likes Blink-182 or good Punk music."
5,"WOOHOO ,WOOHOO ,I TELL YOU !!!!!!!","For anyone who likes punk rock groups like ""Green Day"" this CD can not be missed.It's packed with great songs and dosen't have all of those ""bad songs"" all other CDs have.My favorites in order are: 1.Apple Shampoo 2.Josie 3.Pathetic 4.A New Hope and 5.Dammit. Those songs are certainly the ones to listen to first."
5,Extremely motivational CD for singles!!!,"I absolutely love this CD!!! I wished I'd bought it BEFORE going to see the guys!!! They were awesome live!!! The album is a mixture of thrashy, powerful sounds which comes together in a series of completely heart-pounding tracks!!! Good one guys!!!"
4,"Great punk CD , lots of catchy tunes","Im not much of a punk fan but I did like this CD. Every song has a catchy tune. Theres only one reason that this did not get 5 stars. Alot of the songs sound too much alike. Some good tracks are Dammit, Josie, Pathetic and Apple Shampoo. If you like bands like Sugar Ray or Offspring you will probably enjoy this CD."
5,Brilliant,"This Cd is brilliant. All the songs rule and they actually mean something. Too bad Scott left, he really ruled on the drums. Check out Cheshire Cat as well, and look for their new album in the spring of 99."
5,This is Blink's best CD....,"I know I sound like everybody else but I listened to blink back in the chesire cat days. But I kinda think it's funny when new blink fans say, ""My favorite blink record is chesire cat."" that way they sound cool and try to look like a hardcore fan. Everyone wanted to hate this record because it was played on MTV and they ""Sold Out."" No one really recognized it as their best record. No matter what people say about them...they are very good musicians. Their lyrics, though, could use a little more work. Some are good but some just don't make any sense. You should pick up this record even if it's ""not cool"" to like a band that sold old."
3,"OK, but not the greatest.","Blink 182's previous CD before Enema of the State was OK, but not nearly as good. Some of the songs are good, like ""Pathetic,"" ""Damnit,"" ""Apple Shampoo,"" and ""Dick Lips,"" but still, the CD consentrates on sex jokes and toilet humor too much. When I listen to music, I want to hear good lyrics, not songs about guys masturbating in their rooms. However, if you find this kind of stuff funny, I suggest this CD to you. For those who don't like toilet humor, don't buy it!"
3,Not Bad...,"Well I had high hopes for this CD. But when I got it it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Blink does have funny lyrics and catch tunes. My fav's are ""Dammit"" and ""Enthused""."
2,not good,"I bought blink 182's enema of the state and i liked it, i also liked other punk bands such as Greenday and the Offspring. I thought this would be a good cd. When i got it i was very disapointed. The songs just dont sound musical. The way they picked the chords its more noise than music. The lead singer's voice is kind of annoying too. The only song i like is Damnit (growing up). Don't spend your money on this.. it will give you a headache."
5,Love it,"!Heather's Teenage Son!I got this and Cheshire Cat because I wanted to hear some old Blink-182. I was pleasently suprised by this album. It's much more dirty than Enema of the State, TOYPJ, and their self-titled album, which made it quite funny at times. Quote from the song Waggy: ""I guess I'll jack off in my room until then."" Plus there is a really funny sketch inbetween two songs with a dog drinking out of the toilet Mark had just peed in...I was rolling! My favorite songs on this album were Pathetic, A New Hope, Boring(short, yes but it's cool), and Josie. Immature lyrics and raspy voices will allow you to have alot of fun listening to this album. BUY IT!"
1,Suprisingly Bad,"I like punk, so when i got this for a mere 4 dollors i figured it would be worth it. The only advantage the blink-182 has is that they are mainstream and easy to find. But there are good punk bands that are easy to find too. Take MxPx NOFX for example. But to go back to a normal subject... blink-182 is simply obnoxious, you can stand it the first listen or two, but after that you just want to puke. Avoid this and all blink 182 stuff, i suggest... Suicide Machines, Propagandhi, Digger or MxPx. Buy them, no blink-182!"
1,Bad Music,"Punk I can respect: Sex Pistols, Dead Kennedys, maybe even Living End or something new. But this one is really, really simple, mindless and bad. maybe that's why people like it. But the fact is I don't. So ONE STAR (pity I couldn't give it a zero star). Lucky it's my brothers CD. I would feel quite bad if I were to find that it was mine."
5,GREAT!,I just got this Cd.I only knew 2 song then I read the lyrics and listened to the song and it ruled!
5,Best Punk band around!!!!!!!!!!1,This is probably the best Cd I have ever bought. After hearing Dammit for the first time I decided to buy Dude Ranch. I instantly fell in love with it. It has some great beats and some of the songs have the funniest lyrics. This is one of the few Cds that I can put on and not skip any songs cause there all great songs. I would recommend this band to anyone. Well worth the money!!!!!!!!!!1
5,ever been dumped? well this is the cd for you!,"i was dumped and listend to the entire cd skipping josie and degenreate and josie, aftrer every song i listened to degenerate, the funniest song in the world and josie made me cry"
1,Disappointed........................,"I wasn't going to do a review on Dude Ranch, because I don't like giving bad reviews. Truthfully, this CD is TERRIBLE. I have owned Dude Ranch since day one and I was very disappointed with it and it collects alot of dust. BUT, I have since purchased Enema of the State and completely LOVED it. They have grown as artists...definitely! I am a re-newed fan for Blink and am completely IMPRESSED with Enema of the State, but I DON'T suggest Dude Ranch AT ALL!"
1,"Pathetic baby ""punk""","obviosly Blink 182 thinks punk is just a fast beat. Go up to the lead singer of this sad, sad band and ask him what liberterian socialism is, and see him look in confusion. Sure, what a punk"
1,ugghhh no,this is not punk. this is lil girl music. they were on MtV with that stupid song DAMMIT! and now they are still on mtv. for all of you who think this cd is punk...please define punk.
4,It's dope,"Blink 182 Dude Ranch is on of there older Cd but it is just as good as there new Cd. Voyear,Dammit and Waggy are there best songs on the Cd. there cd sound a lot a like."
3,I Liked Enema Of The State Better,"I liked this cd. It was pretty good. It's a little heavier then Enema Of The State and less disgusting. I'd buy it if you like metal or punk but not if you think it's like Enema Of The State. Enema Of The State is softer and is more pop influenced. This one is good and heavy but I think I like Enema Of The State better. The best songs are Dammit, Josie, and Untitled but most of the tracks are good."
2,Standard skaterock.,"There isn't anything particularly wrong with this music, but I have a problem with people labeling this sort of stuff as ""punk"". Blink have no message, and with all their guitar wankery they end up sounding like a cheeseball Van Halen cover band trying to play pop punk. Blink really aren't much different from most other newschool bands, so anyone who hates this band for ""selling out"", yet listens to Lagwagon and MxPx, is an idiot. Check it out if you're into super-happy-go-lucky newschool skaterock."
2,Too Radio Friendly For Me,"This album is just to poppy in a radio friendly way for me to enjoy it. Also the popular, radio songs are actually some of the best ones on the album. Compared to ""Dammit"" many songs on this album can't live up to it's popularity and style."
3,"Pretty good punk band, the drummer is a little bland","Pretty Good band, but the drummer is pretty bad."
4,Dude Ranch keeps it moving,"For anybody that owned Cheshire Cat way back in the summer of 1995, Blink 182's latest offering doesn't disappoint. God, it's hard naming stand-out tracks amidst all the good stuff; Apple Shampoo, Josie, Dicklips, and Waggy (previously available on the MOM disc) all show off Blink's penchant for blindingly fast tempos and a blend of teen earnestness and goofball humor.By all means, this should be a staple of any So-Cal pop punk diet."
5,BBBBBBBBBLLLLLLLLIIIIIIINNNNNNKKKKKKK1111111888888822222!!!!,"My name is Mike Heil from Brunswick OH. and I think Blink182's CD ""Dude Ranch"" kicks some ASS.My favorite song is ""Dammit""."
1,Where's the warning label?,Should have a warning label: Contains adolescent musicianship and lyrics. Do not use if over 18.
5,WHOA!!!,"Possibly one of the greatest full-length albums to just sit back and chill to. I really enjoyed this album at its fullest. Favorite tracks include Enthused, Josie, and Waggy. I listen to this CD and I start to feel good about anything. The simplicity of the songs and catchy choruses really make this album one of my personal favorites."
3,Good If You Like This Sort Of Music,"I like punk, and I like the Blinksters.... but this CD isn't all that I hoped it would be. Unlike Enema of the State, this has very raw, not-so-melodic songs. I like the more happy songs they put out. They are really good at putting out those catchy bubble gum tunes. The only gems on this CD I find are Josie and Dammit, thier two big singles. Othewise, it's kind of a harsh CD to listen to. Well, for me anyways. If you like the more dry, hard punk... then this CD is perfect for you. It just ain't really my bag."
3,Yes even a...,"hipster like me with such undeniably good taste owns a Blink 182 album. Now before you pounce upon me and call me whatever you want let me tell you why. I think this album is actually quite okay. Now this is coming from somebody who despises all of their other releases. I find this album almost at a level of Green Day's pop punk which is also decent. This album is before the idiots were trying to inject idiotic humor into their music. Simply put there are quite a few pop punk gems in here such as Dammit and Josie. This album does not tread any new water or do I find myself having to listening to it all that often is simply is about 3 chord, catchy, stupid stupid songs that even probably an amateur musician could play."
5,So Many Good Songs So Little Time!!!!!!!!!,"All the songs on this CD are great, everyone of them just kick butt. It's the type of Cd you can listen to over and over again and never get tried of it."
5,This CD is f*cking awesome!!!,I love this CD. ONe of the best CD's/SOngs I have ever listen to. Buy it! Rent it! Steal it if you have too!!! Excellent songs that just make you feel on top. Great beats too.
4,It was an o-kay cd other than the swear words,"Most of the songs were cool. I liked ""Dammit"" and ""Josie"". They're the most popular songs from Blink 182. The cd was good but I didn't like the swearing."
5,"The best blink-182 album, no doubts about it","Like one of the other guys said, combine Cheshire Cat's talent with Enema's maturity as songwriters... and you have Dude Ranch. Not only that, the band's playing ability are at top form here, with plenty of catchy riffs, a solo here and there, great lyrics, raunchiness with the guitar, a totally PUNK atmosphere, and of course, it was the pre-sellout blink-182. And did I mention ""Dammit"" is probably their best song ever outside of ""Carousel""? BUY IT!"
4,howdy Dudes,"This cd in my opinion started the blink 182 stardom. And in Dude Ranch it's a very nice start. The components are all here catchy lyrics, and tunes. Except there is one thing missing: variety. When I first listened to the album called Dude Ranch I found myself thinking these songs sound the same. As I listened more and more I was able to find distiction between the tracks, but still thought it wasn't as creative as Enema of the State. Don't get me wrong there are still good songs to be found such as track 11 Josie, #3 Dammit, and #13 Degenerate. As for all the other tracks the're mediocre punk rock songs. As I said the playing is good, but drums isn't as good because of the reason that Scott who is the drummer in this album was later replaced by Travis who in my opinion is better. But all in all Dude Ranch should please, after a while."
4,GOOD PUNK POP!!!,"I'm not a big fan of BLINK, but this one and the one with the cat in the cover are good punk pop albuns....It's almost EMO, but with some genuine fun lyrics and a even more fun posture....the lyrics are many times incredibly silly and naive, but most of what Blink did is incredibly silly and naive...Anyway, this one brings me sweet memories from the early 90's, where music was still alive and even the girls were punk...."
5,blink's best,"i'm a big blink 182 fan, and before i got dude ranch i thought that enema of the state was their best. then i got this cd and i know i was wrong. this cd has some of the best songs, and these tracks stood out from the rest: first of all, there was pathetic, which is basically Mark with Tom in the backround. then there's Voyeur, which is just Tom but it doesn't really sound like him. Then there's one of their best, which is Dammit. I have no idea why it is called that, although another name for it is "" Growing Up"" so i think that the name Dammit is better. then there's boring, one of their lesser known songs.After that is [Click] lips, which has a few misspellings ( click lips and rich lips are some examples) then enthused, which has a great intro, and the same goes for untitled. then, finally, there's josie, their best song ever, and then after that there's two of my favorites, degenerate and lemmings. all in all, this is blink 182's best."
5,blinks best!,"this is one of blinks best. this cd is the old school punk cd i didnt expect from them. this is before travis,you know the old drummer scott.i dont know why, but im starting to think scott is a better drummer than travis. people call me crazy for that but thats the truth.travis is a amazing drummer but scott, i dont know i just, i dont know like this feeling that he is. he wouldnt run around naked so thats one thing. this is a awesome album, buy it!!!!!"
2,"More ""punks"" than punk","Blink 182 seems to have all the ingredients to make an excellent album (or at least a darn good bunch of songs). They've got the chops (their playing is always competent, and occasionally impressive), they show a rare glmpse at good songwriting, and they can bring it all together (as they show quite well on ""Dammit""). But they don't do it enough - too many of the songs run together in the generic ""I'm not OK""/""you're not OK""/""he's not OK""/""the world's not OK"" mode written from a teen angst point of view, which can get just as boring as the Backstreet Boys ""you know I love you, girl"" mode. I wouldn't bother reviewing this except songs like ""Dammit"" make it clear that they can do it so much better. This one's best suited for 14-year-old pre-punks of all ages."
5,This is the best cd of all time.,"I absolutely love this cd. i've been listening to it regularly for 3 years and i love it even more than when i started. from the shreeking start of pathetic to the to the teenage anthem of i'm sorry, dude ranch is blink's best cd. even though blink didn't have travis, the music still kicks ass with scott. tom wrote his best guitar riffs on this cd and cheshire cat. if you still aren't convinced this is a great cd, it has dammit on it, that's reason enough."
5,blink at their best,"Blink's best cd. it sounds gruff, yet melodic. Better quality than their earlier stuff, but not as clean as Enema. It's the perfect mix. I don't know what else to say besides this is my favourite album, and I think everyone should hear it."
3,Good but not Great,"Well this cd is a good cd but I think their other stuff is alot better. U can tell that they got better over the years of experience and doing live shows. They are cool but they are kind poppy and not really punk, to me punk is NOFX or Bad Religion. But for a poppy punk group this cd is cool. Kinda emo in its own way but really cool to hang out to."
5,Great cd!!!,This cd is great I like all the songs on it! If you like Punk Rock you sure don't want to pass this one up! Get this cd!
3,It's Alright...,"I bought their new cd ""Enema of the State"" and it was AWSOME, so I figured that their others would be too. I went out and bought ""Dude Ranch"" yesterday and was a little disappointed in it. Dude Ranch is ALRIGHT, but the best song on it is ""dammit"" and you can get that one on the soundtrack to ""Can't Hardly Wait"" and get other good songs on it too."
3,A FAIR CD,"This is not the best blink-182, the best blink-182 is enema of the state. This cd is alright, but my favorite one is enema of the state, ALL THE WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,please someone tell me this is a joke,"There is no way a band like this can actually have a fanbase and millions of copycats... the notion that a human being's taste in music could be so diluted as to praise ""dude ranch"" as one of the greatest albums ever makes me ill. This is paint by numbers buoyant teenage pop music with guitars.When I go on a discourse about how 'blink 182' are an abomination the argument associated with dude ranch is ""well it was before they were popular"". HA. popular or not, ""dude ranch"" is the same diluted boy band + instruments who put out ""the rock show"" and ""all the small things"". stop fooling yourselves, kiddies. their musical basis is rehashing the same melody and ear piercing vocal hook over and over again at different tempo and with different wordsthis album is lame, and this bands moronic fans are lame"
2,Loses authenticity.,"Dude Ranch by Blink 182 was a cd I liked about ten years ago but listening to it now, this type of music is childish and pointless. Dammit and Josie are the best songs on the album, the rest are filler and lame. The lyrics was this band's downfall, the harmonies are not there either. Great for its time but ultimately this cd gets thrown out after the novelty wears off."
2,it's good - but it aint that good,I bought this having heard friends rave about it but since 'enemy of the state' was released it has stayed on the shelf. This album doesn't really compare.
3,Get the Vintage version,Get the Vintage version of Kit Fisto at Star Wars 2011 Vintage Collection Action Figure #29 Kit Fisto. It's a vast improvement over this figure.
3,"Great Show, Terrible DVD",I have to say that this show is hilarious. I have watched just about every episode and the show has steadily gotten better since it premeired. If I had one complaint its these terrible DVD sets. Both Season 1 parts 1 and 2 have only had 4 episodes each. Its the same with this DVD set. Just 4 episodes. For 13.49. Not a very good deal at all. Its disappointing that such a good show has gotten such disappionting DVD releases.
5,Bathtime fun!!!,"My son loves to play with this net and the fish while in the tub. He uses the net to catch any bath toys that will fit in it. The three fish that come with the net are brightly colored and have bumps and texture. My son likes to chew on them like teethers in the bath. The fish are numbered and have the same number of holes in the bottom of the belly to strain water, but the number two and three fish only have one stream of water coming out despite having more holes. Overall, it's a fun little toy. My son often carries the net out of the bath with him and holds onto it until he goes to bed."
2,paint easily comes off this toy,"Normally I am 100% satisfied with all the Sassy toys I have purchased, but this one I am not happy with. I found after several months of play, the paint on the fish has come off. As babies put everything in their mouth, the paint peel can be very problematic. I ended up throwing the fish away. The paint on the butt of the net has faded slightly, but has not literally peeled off as has happened with the fish."
4,Second Edition,The book is a good history of the St. Croix River that is now the St. Croix National Scenic Riverway. The book was originally written in 1964/5 and this version is only updated in the introduction so the history ends before Congress passed the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.Dunn does give a thorough history of the river prior to 1965. The book is a good read especially if you are from the Minnesota Wisconsin area.
4,About the full rank assumption of D12 and D21,The easiest way to ignore those assumptions is turn to LMI-based H-infinity formulation. The full rank assumption can also be satisfied by purposely pulling out some signals from the augmentation plant...
2,"Previously Unreleased, probably for legitimate reasons","Though the musicianship is facile, this album doesn't have the same power to wrap around the brain stem that his other solo albums have. This album just doesn't have the tentacles. Still, it is a valid historical document with an all-star cast. But did A. More really want it released?"
3,Bad quality,"This is the first product I ordered from sprouthouse. I used Kitchen crop sprouter to make sprouts. But somehow more than 50% of seeds doesn't germinate. Specifically I think all the alfalfa seeds are getting wasted from this mix. Initially I thought may be I am doing some thing wrong. But when I tried the plain alfalfa seeds which I got as sample pack with the sprouter, they germinated fine and I got the good yield. Later on I tried the Raddish mix from the sprout house and they seem to be doing fine. But this mix no matter what I do, i.e., watering more number of times, keeping in dark place etc didn't help. I guess either I got the seeds from a bad batch or they are too old stock. I tried to see weather I can contact them from my orders, but could not figure it out. I am giving 3 stars thinking the pack I got from a bad batch. I didn't bother try to return as I used up half of the pack during this tryouts."
5,"Seeds, seeds and more seeds",This was my first time sprouting and it was a great experience. My seeds were starting to sprout within 24 hours and mostly all sprouted by the second day. Quite a tasty mix too! I enjoy a salad with just sprouts more than a lettuce salad.
3,Sprouting seeds,"This mix was OK and the price is reasonable, but there are a lot of unusable seeds in the bag that do not sprout - I'd say about 25%."
1,"Failed to Grow, Ridiculous Lack of Instructions","Having just successfully grown two kinds of seeds, using the same technique, these immediately mildewed. They came with no instructions, except to look on the Web. On his site it said instructions are expensive, and would be posted in a few days. I.e., there are no instructions for this mix as far as I could see. I have news for you Todd, in the last company I worked with we provided BOTH written instructions with the product and a Web site. Instructions are for a customer's convenience, not yours, Todd, and are not omitted so that you can save a few cents."
3,What sprouts is good,"This is a good mix, and sprouts well, except half the smaller seeds - not sure whether it is clover or alfalfa, don't sprout. If all of them had sprouted this would have been five stars!I sprout using a glass jar or stainless steel vessel, and a tea strainer to change the water. Initially, I thought that I was getting white fungus, and threw out a few batches. Later, I realized one of the seeds (broccoli or radish), has fuzzy hair in the sprout which looks like white fungus unless you inspect it closely.I got the mix because the seeds are not available in smaller quantities, and I did not want to buy 4 pounds worth of seeds. But given the fact that there are too many blanks in a mix, I think I will try ordering just two individual seeds next time."
3,Good but half of the seeds won't germinate,"These are good seeds in a sense that the final sprout tastes really good. However, half of the seeds won't germinate every time I make sprouts (and I make sprouts every day). I have used both a mason jar and a sprouter and have the same experience in both, therefore, I am not doing anything wrong. Given that the sees are organic and not engineers, some seeds not germinating is normal but I think 50% is a little bit low of a yield."
4,Broccoli mix sprout seeds,"Good sprouting yield and great price. Sprouts are a little bitter, don't know if it is the broccoli part that is causing the sprouts to be bitter."
2,Ouch - very ouch...,"I tell you what folks - I love Godzilla and Specterman as much as the next guy, but this is just brutal. There's no real good guy, everyone is just varying degrees of evil. We have the battlesuit pilot; a drunken, chilly and abusive bastard. The mechanic, who's not a bad guy, but is constantly being wailed on by the aforementioned pilot. And of course, the monsters - an alien substance causes normal people to mutate into odd creatures, including a 50-foot chicken. Yes, he said CHICKEN! With no really likeable characters, and special effects that would make the crew of Dr. Who groan, this was mostly a waste of time and money."
2,Make sure Workbook Edition Matches the text Edition,"I ordered both books through Amazon. I searched for the text, and ensured it was the correct edition. There was an option provided by Amazon to add the workbook, which I also wanted. However, the workbook was for the previous version of the text, and I wasn't paying attention for the differences. At the time of this review Amazon did not offer the current version of the workbook, but other sellers had it available. As far as I can tell this won't be a mjor obstacle in doing the work as long as your instructor doesn't insist on having the correct edition assignments."
5,Good buy for speaking Spanish!,This book is a life-saver when speaking with a Latino and you do not know Spanish.
4,Not bad,"Actually, I'd probably give this 3.5 stars. While you're taking the ride of reading ""Fortune's Daughter"" it is great, but the end leaves something to be desired. It did not satisfy me as much as I thought it would. Lila and Rae are great characters, although Rae's devotion to her boyfriend is pretty sickening. I guess I would reccomend reading this, but if I had to rate all of the Hoffman books I have read, this would be at the bottom. Practical Magic and The River King are about a zillion times better, they are probably Hoffman's masterpieces. If you do read this book and are disappointed, you should still read other books by Hoffman, because this is not the greatest represtentation. But I'm not giving it enough credit- it's not a bad read, and I do suggest that anyone who likes Hoffman should read it."
4,Fortune's Daughter,"Alice Hoffman just happens to be my favorite author. I've read all of her books and anxiously await whatever's new to come out. Fortune's Daughter was no exception. In this novel, she created characters that you could really get a picture of. All of them, from Jessup and Rae, to Lila, Lila's parents, Lila's husband Richard and his parents, they were all so imperfect. I like that in Hoffman's stories. No one is perfect, they all have flaws and insecurities and that makes the story so much more believeable. What I like about Hoffman so much is that she makes the ordinary interesting and somehow, even if what's she's describing is fantasy-like or unreal, she has a way of making you believe it could actually happen. Nothing is ever way out. I highly recommend this book. As a mother, it made me think twice about my relationship with my own son and what's important to me."
2,Story just stops,"This book was interesting enough to finish reading, but it just left you hanging. There is no ending. It is as if she was tired of writing the book and just stopped at some point."
2,Mystical,"Fortunes Daughter is about Rae, a young, unmarried girl who is awaiting the birth of her child and Lila, a fortune-teller with no interest in the future who lost her child when she was a young, unmarried girl.Rae and Lilas lives, fates and futures intertwine as each tries to make peace with the past and become a better person for the future.Not knowing the what the book was really about, Lilas fortune telling, visions, nightmares, spirituality stuff was different then what I would normally read. I didn't like how Lila was so emotionally torchered all her life and never fully found peace.Without spoiling the storyline, I can say that as an Adoptive Mom I REALLY didn't like how one element of the book was treated. At all.All in all, it was an OKAY read. I read it in a weekend and like all of Hoffmans other books, she pulls you in with her ability to turn everyday events into enchanting words."
2,The Decline Of Shelley Winters,"In the second half of her career Shelley Winters seemed determined to make everyone forget what a fine actress she once was (A Double Life, A Place In The Sun, Night Of The Hunter, Diary Of Anne Frank, Alfie, to name a few of her memorable films). Her post-Poseidon Adventure filmography is a list of forgettable films with forgettable performances, and Poor Pretty Eddie is no exception. Leslie Uggams finds herself stranded in a southern redneck town (are there any other kinds of southern towns in movies?), with a population whose collective IQ barely gets into three-digit territory (are there any other kinds of redneck populations in movies?). She is being held prisoner by a country singer/Elvis wanna-be, and is subject to repeated rapes by her captor and repeated humiliation by the townsfolk. If this is your cup of tea, then by all means go for it, but otherwise just avoid it."
2,breakage,"just finished my last kimono off from a 12-pack and lo and behold, it broke. nothing fancy done, just some straight missionary and afterwards i find the condom broken and wrapped around my base like a c-ring. nice. i should have expected this from something that has such a ""grippy"" feeling lubricant. water-based is right, it feels like water and has about the same lubricating principles. to top it off it does smell very rubbery.i'll stick to me tried and true durex ultra thin and ribbed condoms. plus, they come in a nice shade of red :)"
4,It was a pleasure to Test Drive this ...,It was a pleasure to Test Drive this product. Both my partner and I were please by its enhanced sensitivity. Will recommend it to my close friends.
3,Blondie - Union City Blue,"Blondie's ode to the working class, UNION CITY BLUE (from the movie of the same name), gets plenty of house mixes on this single. And while all of them are entertaining, the continual 4-to-the-floor kick drum gets a little old, especially since the mid-90's club sound just doesn't hold up over the years. But come to think of it, neither did the union movement in the United States..."
3,engineering feats,More detail on the state of the US space effort still amazes me that so much knowledge was created so long ago
4,We must help each other,"I don't think that ""Divided we fall"" was such a good choice of translation of this movie's name. I personally come from Slovakia, the neighboring country to the Czech Republic, and we understand each other languages - and as my title says, the true meaning is ""We must help each other"". And that's what is the movie about - about people, their will to help each other, the strenght and weakness of the human character. The DVD is already out in Europe and what I can say is that the movie hasn't lost any of it's charm with the transfer to the DVD. However, as for Europe usual, the DVD had just little to no extras, because of all the different languages they have to pack on the DVD. We will see, if the US-version is better. Of course, you will be able to check it, just look a little bit higher on your screen, there you'll find it ... As I said, we must help each other. Didn't I help you now?"
5,Divided We Fall,"Marvelous-I have never seen anything like this on the Holocaust. Human, warm, funny---wonderful presentation of people caught in this larger than life series of events."
4,What a tangled web,"WHAT: WWII German occupation of Czechoslovakia; middle aged childless couple attempt to conceal Jewish man in their apartment; to avoid suspicion they pretend to be Nazi sympathizersWHY: Excellent performances from cast, but especially from husband Josef and former colleague Horst who is now his Nazi superior; tension and black comedy abound; wonderful irony, not too heavy handed; not as forced as ""Life Is Beautiful""; ending is best part of a very good movie"
3,lamp shade surprise,"When I ordered this Mickey Mouse lamp, the lamp I chose had a different lampshade than the one I ordered. I really wanted the shade that had Mickey circling the bottom edge of the shade.However I didn't want to fool with all the trouble and expense to send it back.In the future I may hesitate to order from Amazon."
4,"For readers who like to think ""what if""?","A very enjoyable read. Having read other works of Koestler, I am amazed at the broad range he covers in his writing. In this book, Koestler deals with how and why coincidences happen, from psychology to subatomic physics. You'll be surprised..."
1,Disappointed,"Ordered the collector's edition and found that were written notations throughout the book, on the back cover. Not what was advertised. I will never do business with this company again."
5,A must read,Astonishing book which leaves you with passion to read more about this subject. This is a serious discussion about the things we all feel but still do not know how to describe them in a structured scientific way. The book also gives a good scrutiny to the discourse which purposely ignores the parts of the universe which are not directly accessible to the human five major senses. The book suggests some theoretical frameworks that should be elaborated further with scientific courage. To stress the seriousness of the subject and of the author - Koestler had put his money where his mouth is bequeathing most of his estate to Parapsychological research.
2,Incorrect and confused conclusions!,"This book is based solely on the speculations of the author, that obviously has little or none scientific research to back him up. ""How does nature know how the statistic quota for an occurrency has been filled?"" Koestler asks himself, not understanding the fact that the statistic distributions designed to calculate probability follows certain patterns in nature - not the other way around. Closest at hand for Koestler was to label these occurrencies as paranormal - as guided by a higher power. Arthur Koestler loved science, but science did not love him back."
3,For Consideration,This is a nice bundle an must have for the vintage effect freak !This is NOT a book about the mods from Analog Mike ! It's just a nice collection of the most famous pedals.
1,Is not the Cheryl Ladd movie!!!!!,"Ok 1 star is because is not what i thinking will be!! Yes on you information about the video you wrote that this is a movie with Cheryl Ladd, but is not!!! This is an intimate portrait of the lovely and adorable Grace Kelly, (fot the documentary 5 stars), but is not what i would like to have!!!!!I'm so idsappointed with Amazon for this!!!Alberto Ugazio"
5,Very effective knife!,"These RADA knives are just excellent, so far. Hope they hold up, I've only had mine for a month or two. This particular one (bagel) just goes right into a bagel or other breads, perceptibly better than your average bread knife. Sharp as heck, they all are, and I think maybe another reason they're so good is that the metal has a mirror polish, which I think might make them slipperier in the material. I'd like to see them sell a stronger ""safety sleeve"" for the knife drawer. Be careful.The handle is a bit short for my big hand but I'm used to it. And the handle is metal, so please use dry hands only.Dishwashers always shorten the sharp-life of cutlery. Although these are not expensive, use soap and water, hand rinse and dry quickly."
4,It has been a while since I've used ...,"It has been a while since I've used Kleenex brand tissue, and I don't know why I switched before. I've been using the off-brand tissues just to save money, but I was just reminded how the Kleenex brand is worth every penny. It was soft like a tissue should be -- and not once did I suffer any soreness associated with off-brand tissues. I liked it so much that I'd take some to work so I wouldn't have to use the off brand we have there either. I normally don't do things like that, but I had to since I was suffering with this terrible flu this season."
3,"I love Kleenex, but it is much more expensive here...","These Kleenex are great...Big box, hold together, but they are much more expensive online than at the store - about twice as much for the exact same product. I love having them shipped right to my door, but not for that much!"
2,Easily Smudged,"These earrings, though pretty, are very easily smudged. For something intended to be worn against the skin, this is a BIG NO, NO. When you first put the earrings on (after washing) they are sparkly and pretty. However, about an hour later, after bobbing against one's skin (particularly those of us with oily skin, I suspect) they look like a completely different pair of earrings. The oily smudges on them change the look from sparkly crystal, to cheap plastic. For a decoration (not worn on the body), the material is great, however as an earing, I wouldn't recommend them."
5,Great Earrings,"These earrings are great. They are very high quality and shine a lot. They are very light and comfortable to wear. These earrings will take on the color of whatever you are wearing. I suggest you also get the pendant, it is a great pair."
3,pretty but small,pretty but small these were very hard to get on and or off maybe a teenager would be able to wear these i couldn't
3,"Pretty, but not clear and a little cheap looking.","At first glance I thought these are pretty earrings (they do sparkle and shine), but is states ""clear"" so that's what I thought I was getting. Once I put them on they look as if some part of it is painted (yellow no less), which makes them look a little cheap. Also the part that goes in your ear is curved which makes it very difficult to put them on. Sorry but I don't think I will be buying any more."
5,Highly recommend these earrings!,"While I was unsure, thinking these would be a bit too dainty and not show up with my long hair, I was very pleasantly surprised when I opened up the package (which, by the way, arrived very promptly). The picture is accurate, but truly doesn't do them justice. They are a good size (although not huge), very good quality and SPARKLY! I would recommend these for anyone from aged 13 to 90, and at this price, why not?? Another bonus - they go with absolutely everything!"
5,Swarovski Cube Crystal & Sterling Silver Earrings,"These are beautiful earrings. The Swarovski crystal just sparkles. I bought them as a present for my daughter, and she loves them."
2,Ending Confusing,"The ending was confusing. Also, don't expect a very hot sexual scene with Heather Graham.This one is more of a warning against drug use.Or this is a warning to young ladies about what kind of obstacles they can face if they want to head out to Hollywood and be famous.I would skip buying this one, unless you are a huge Heather Graham fan. Or, it would be a good movie to show, IF you have a girlfriend or daughter heading to Hollywood."
2,"Even As A Free Rental, 2 Stars","From the completely bogus pick up line on a beach in LA to begin this movie, I should have realized it was going to be a waste of time to watch. This movie goes no were fast, particularly with the character development, which is best described as poor at best."
2,don't like this type of movie,I have never liked the type of movie that keeps flashing back and forth through time frames and/or reality. Too convoluted for my tastes.
1,Very poor!,"I have a lot of dvds. I have gotten some dvds based on average or better reviews such as this one has one Amazon. If they are real marginal, I give them away for a gag gift, but I threw this one away after watching most of it in ""fast forward"" mode. I know there are many people who live like this, but why publicize it? Some ""no mind"" who watches it may want to model their life after it because they think it is cool."
2,THE EMPERIOR IS NOT WEARING ANY CLOTHES AND THIS FILM IS NOT THAT GOOD! 2 1/2 STARS!,"I know I'm going to get some heavy flack for this review, but I have to be honest.....this film is not that good! I love little independent films like this, but I have seen many that are far better dealing with similar situations. The characters seemed cookie cutter to me and for a film as short as this I found myself looking at my watch....not a good sign. I am really surprised at the high praises on this site as I just didn't feel that involved. It's not a really bad film, but lower your expectations. While the acting is first rate the film is just OK and that's about it."
2,"""You're not MY manager""","Ok I ""get"" the movie and what it was about and the twist and all, but I still think it could've been executed in a better way. Love Heather Graham and it was nice to see Jake and Linda, but I gotta be honest and say that I was a lot bored with most of the film. Sorry I can't quite put my finger on it as to what I think would've made the film better for me, but I can say this...if you're a Heather Graham fan then you should check it out.Does it suck that my favorite part of the movie is when the boyfriend tells the diner manager, ""...You're not MY manager...."", haha ohhh man that killed me!"
1,"I get it, I just didn't like it",I understand what the filmmakers were trying to do with the non linear technique. It just didn't work. I wished I would have read some reviews from film critics first. I wouldn't have watched this if I had known how much I'd dislike this movie. Not for me!
3,So So junkie film,Heather Graham plays a burnt out druggie pretty well in this film but the film just lacks substance. Its still worth a watch though.
4,Give it time,"Not a perfect game, too many jiggles in the animations, no Conseco Fieldhouse, strange whooshing cut away on replays, but some nice additons too, the pro hop, etc."
2,Update Live 2003!,"This game sucks. The only ways to score ar dunks and 3 pointers.Its like going waaayy back to ""double dribble"" (1st nentendo b-ball game) or something. If you look at the player ratings, everyone is sorry. Including the all-stars. Baron Davis is more dangerous than Shaq, for example. The gameplay is slow and stiff. And you can't spin or cross-over easily. The only thing easy about this game is throwing bad passes, because they complicated that too. You will either spend hours updating the game or not want to play it. Graphics are the only plus."
2,Live still cannot match the 2k games,"I rented both of the different basketball games within a week of each other. The ESPN (2k) was by far a better all around game. Live lacks any sort of defensive presence. Scoring is way to easy. They attempted to create a 1 on 1 mode, but espn's is a street mode which you can do anything from 1on1 to 5on5. They finally included a dynasty mode, but no owner mode like in madden. I did not even try to clear room on my memory card to have a team when I bought the game. Espn is still the best. The 24/7 mode keeps the game interesting. It allows you to not only improve a player, but also have fun making yourself a better player. Don't waste your money, rent both first and make a comparison."
2,NBA Live 2004,"You people have to dumb to think this game is good. It is unrealistic, and that feeestyle controller makes crossovers that you would never see in a NBA game. You can go to the whole with no trouble and score with a little push on the analog stick. NBA 2K3 was clearly a better game than NBA Live 2003. NBA 2K3 is a realistic game with better gameplay and calls. You can control everything. Trust me ESPN NBA Basketball a.k.a. NBA 2K4 will be cuttin NBA Live 2004 to the fullest."
4,WHAT A GAME. IT GETS NO BETTER THAN THIS,"NBA LIVE 2004 IS GOING TO BE THE BEST GAME EVER. THIS IS EA SPORTS BEST YEAR EVER. FIRST U CAN PLAY ONLINE. NEXT THE JERSEYS ACTUALLY MOVE. THIRD IF YOUR CREATED PLAYER HAVE BRAIDS HIS HEAR WILL MOVE. FOURTH U CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE SWEAT. FIFTH U WILL SEE BLOOD ON A HARD FILE TO THE NOSE, LIP, OR WHATEVER. SIXTH WHEN YOUR USING THE POINT GUARD AND GARNETT IS AT FORWARD AND YOUR NOT BY HIM, WHEN GARNETT TRIES TO GO TO THE HOLE NO NEED TO SWITCH, SOMEONE WILL BE ALERTED AND WILL GET THERE QUICKER. SEVENTH DONT EXPECT TO HAVE 25 BLOCKS IN A GAME BECAUSE BLOCKING IS MUCH HARDER AND REALER. LAST ITS THE BEST EA SPORTS GAME THIS YEAR. ALSO DONT GET IT FOR XBOX BECAUSE U WONT EVEN SEE THEIR REAL FACE. XBOX SUCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!."
4,a qreat qame 4 NBA Live,"This is a great game off the bat. i luv NBA Live games, i jus didnt get it in 2001, 2002, 2003, but 2004 rocks, especially da soundtrack. it g0t da video of ""right thurr"" in NBA Live remix, all u just need 2 do is wait at da opening screen after it says ""pick your favorite team."" iz really cool, and u could make ur own players jus like da previous ones. i dunt hav ESPN NBA Basketball, or like sum people call NBA 2K4. but i think that both oof them would b pretty go0d games, but i need 2 qet NBA 2k4 first 2 make sure."
3,My Review,"I recently played NBA Live 2004, and i was not impressed at all.To me it is not near as good as the previous year. You can buy it and see for yourself but, i am just saying to me it was an upset! This years game is more like the previous years NBA 2K3. Overall it is about a 3 star game to me."
4,IT'S THE BEST SPORTS GAME HANDS DOWN!!!!!!!,NBA Live 2004 is the best game on the market. I love all EA games they really do there homework when its come to improving from year to year. I will always be a fan!!!
1,worst game ever,"i hope the the football department at easports makes 3 times as much money as the basketball department. this game is horrible. i don't think i've ever seen so many glitches, especially at key moments in the game. the worst was when they were down by 4 and made one of my other guys foul the shooter who still managed to make the shot, which counted. then instead of shooting free throws, they get the ball back and score again to send it into OT. the computer will go backcourt or out of bounds and not get called for it. then like others have said, players will defy physics and stop in mid-air on their way to a dunk just so a defensive player can come from behind and block them. i use to buy nba live on an annual basis but will be switchin my choice for the 2005 version."
1,not very good,"This game is very unrealistic, and just plain bad. I would take a wide open 3 with Tracy McGrady, and miss1 like every time. I also don't think that shoot, and dunk/lay up need to bee two different button's, it's very stupid. The free style control was good last year but here it stinks! you don't know what move you gonna do because you can't do a crossover or spin with square,X,triangle,or circle so it is hard to fake out defender's. Overall this just ins't a very good game though the graphics are good"
1,don't buy it,"i haven't played this game but i know from experience (i have 2003) that this probably sucks. let me take a guess and say that yao ming and lebron james aren't even in the game. as far as the dynasty mode goes, you realize that the averages per 48 minutes are completly out of whack, such as when i played tyson chandler for 40 minutes a game and he still had only 6.0 rebounds a game when simulating(the same average for when he played 19 minutes a game). he should be averaging at least 10.5. the rookies provide stats that are less than encouraging, nen had 9 points and 5 boards per game in 38 minutes!!! also, where are the foreign players to be found in the rookie draft (they make up practically half of the first round). for the gameplay, the only exciting teams would be sacramento and dallas, yet the knicks offensive scheme is strictly run-and-gun."
2,nba live fell way off,"nba live fell way off the charts with this game here, its not even close to 2003, if i would have known it sucked this bad i would not have bought it, dont waste your money, maybe next year they will make a hotter game, dam and i love the legacy of nba live since the days of sega genesis man, dam this really hurts. lol. words of advice go back to the camera angles from 2003 please get more dunks. better post plays, i must say i like the announcers marv and mike, i loved the jump shots from 2003 go back to that please. im out i could write about this game all day, ps thanx for putting vince on the cover. let me guess lebron next year."
3,"ESPN NBA Basketball is still king, but Live is improving","First of all, don't listen to the fellow who said Live has ""always been better,"" because until last year, Live was a horrifically awful game. Last year it improved, and this year it improved even more. It still has arcadey and glitchy problems however. ESPN is the way to go, but as I said Live is improving."
1,EA Makes No Deference For Basketball,This game is about the same thing as last year. Nba 2004 is nothing but a waste of money the gameplay is wack the freestyle dribble is the same as 2003 series. If you really what a basketball game get ESPN nba ect. 2K4
4,Game returned,"This game was a duplicate for my grandsons and was returned, using one of your return labels in late Dec. or early Jan. Thus far I have received no credit for my return and need to discuss this with someone. All I can find is more web sites about returns but no way to send an inquiry about my return. Can youhelp me? I wish to communicate with a PERSON. Thanks.Carolyn T. Foley"
4,Authentic-sounding chanties,"If you want to know how sea chanties originally sounded on the decks and under them back in the 18th and 19th centuries, this is an album for you. It can be a time-consuming process to sort through the load of sea chanty albums out there that when you're trying to find the traditional sound. Therefore, if you like the sound of this album I also recommend the following albums, composed by various performers including some on this album: Blow the Man Down; Sailors' Songs & Sea Shanties; Shanties & Songs of the Sea. These albums have a great mix of emotion in them, from rip-roarin' drinking songs to inspirational working songs to melancholy tunes about ships that were swallowed up by the sea. Round Cape Horn generally has a more relaxed (and sometimes more sombre) tone with a couple exceptions."
3,spreader,"Bigger than I expected, I was looking for smaller version with wood handle. but it does the job. might not recommend."
5,Makes you wants a 4th SSX game...,"This game is absolutely flawless. I was never a fan of snow boarding until I picked up this game. The graphics are good, the controls are simple and natural to the controller, and the music is awesome (higher ground-chili peppers, N.E.R.D., etc.). I bought this game to play on my Ps3. Yes Ps3. The game is that addictive."
4,Yet another good review,"With all the other good reviews about this game who needs another. But I just felt like writing this one. First the game this off da chain but not that much better. First if you master Tony Hawk then the only thing to worry about this the racing which I consider a flaw. To think I do all the ramp stuff first and when a race comes up I think ""Oh God no."" Next is the longivity which is often a game's weakness. If the challege does not keep you playing the fun will. So what is the problem it enough levels especially for RPG fans who love long games. I would have given it 5 stars but for the would have to be perfect and it is not but it does come close."
4,Tricky Just Got Trickier,"I bought this game today for my Nintendo Gamecube and its trippin.i mean, i haven't played it yet, but we ARE talking about the king of all snowboarding games! tricky is the crown gem of my video game library, but that might be about to change due to the great new addition to the SSX family. i remember the first time i played Elise, my score then was around 350 on garibaldi. my score now with elise on garibaldi? 600,000! yup, im constantly improving and can't wait to get the feel of this great new game. a total must buy."
2,Not as good as you think,"If your buying this game because you've played the first two, you are making a bad move. I feel this game is not a good game. I didn't ike this game. I feel that this game trys to do to much and the tricks arent as good. This game is not nearly as good as the first two. I loved the first two, SSX tricky and SSX. This game is not very good. I hope you will read this and beleive it"
5,SSX: Super Snowboarding to the Xtreme,"Wow... that's all that I have to say about this game, its amazing. I bought the PlaySatation Magazine for the month of October, and the demo is on it. I played it, and it was amazing. Sure, it does have some control issues, but they're minor, and unimportant. This game is amazing, though. The musical score is also impressive, including songs from Finger 11, Jane's Addiction, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. This game will sell perfectly judging by the last two games from the SSX franchise. I can't wait for this game to come out, ...That's all of my input... if you don't believe me on the greatness of this game then you really are a bad gamer."
4,Out Of Stock/Not Able To Get Product,"A great game. So much so that because our old one was scratched, I ordered a new one from Amazon. After 2 months of delays, I'm told Amazon can't get the item, so it shouldn't be listed on Amazon still if they can't get the game! I did find it elswhere online and order it."
4,This game is awesome!,"This game is an awesome FAMILY game! We love it, from the youngest to the oldest! Our two year old ""plays,"" and loves to watch the characters snowboard down the mountain. Our five year old can't do all of the tricks, but she has fun just surviving a run. Our nine year old LOVES this game, as do her dad and I! It's a lot of fun for the whole family. The graphics are excellent, the tricks are awesome, and the challenges never end; it's a great sequel to SSX Tricky (the second version). Highly addictive, and totally in a great way!"
4,SSX 3,"SSX 3 is the perfect snow boarding game out there. The series is better than every other snow boarding series out there,too. With that said it does lack a few things. Its kinda hard in the beggining to do tricks..but you will get used to it. But overall once you figure verything out its not so fun playing it. The 2 player is great and online play is cool too but it sucks playing alone... Here is the overview of the gameGraphics-Really good. Improved from last time.Easiness-Gets a little tough at timesFun-ness-Its great 2 player and online but it sucks one player"
3,SSX3,"Over all keep hold of the first two ssx style and tricks. They did modify the areas where you snowboard and mad it more of a free range so you can go through the mountain just looking for all the short cut as well as collect items to unlock things. Music was ok, and the game play was very fun, and fast paces, but still could work on it. Loved all the different gear you can put on your player, that is a great improvement in the SSX game."
5,Awesome,"this game is great!!!!!!!!! get it now. have no doubts. if you know how to play SSX/SSX Tricky, you'll have no problem with SSX 3. great graphics, new riders, blood-pumpin courses,this would sure sound like a great game to me. and to you parents...THIS GAME IS SOOOOO GREAT YOU'LL PROBABLY BE SNEAKING A COUPLE GAMES BEHIND YOUR KID'S BACK!!"
4,fun at first,"I am not saying that this game is bad but it gets sorta boring after a while. I rented it for a weekend then its started getting boring. I was about to buy this game but I wanted to rent it first. Then I realized that it was ok.The game is very short, there are only three peaks. There is a lodge that you start off in ""Conquer the Mountain"" where you can change hairstyles or change or buy clothes, and buy boards. Thats pretty neat. The stages are just wild! Thats what I like of SSX games. This one is a lot better than the previous ones.Definetely rent this game if you can. I am not telling you to not buy it but I recommend you not to.Have fun with the game!"
4,SSX3 is cool if u know what i'm sain' cool cold snow hehe,This game is pretty fun the tracks are so cool to ride on.There's new modes and the graphics rock ass.I like this game and if u like SSX Tricky ull like this.
3,O.K i guess,this game was so fun at the beggining when your doing all of the peaks. but once you go around for the 2nd time you have to race down the whole peak in 11 minsits impossible even when my stats are maxed outdefinetly rent and rent twice so you dont just get the easy part
2,Lots of Mistakes,"There is some decent info in here but like many chess books written before PCs rose to prominence, there are just so many calculation mistakes that it becomes distracting. I would have a hard time recommending this book unless someone takes it upon themselves to update it and publish a new edition."
5,One Of The Best Ever Columbo Episodes,"Excellent episode, Columbo takes on Leonard Nimoy. This episode is about a brilliant surgeon who goes bad. As usual with Columbo episodes this one has superb writing and excellent acting."
3,Second time's a charm,"I was a fairly decent Lego engineer as a child, but it still took me about 20 minutes of attempted assembly before I realized that the first rack I received had flawed frame pieces - the slots where the horizontal pieces are placed were completely mis-aligned - the two vertical frame pieces should be identical. I shipped the rack back, and was able to assemble the replacement rack. Some of the bolt holes weren't big enough, so I had to drill them out a smidge. Also, the upper two holes are placed such that it takes a few minutes to turn the bolts with the provided tool (hex key) due to tight spaces. Assembly note: 1. place all bolts to finger tight, 2. position the frame so that it is symmetrical, and 3. tighten down - otherwise, you may end of with the Leaning Tower of Vino. But hey, the thing works, and I needed this smaller size to fit on the shelf under my mobile bamboo island."
4,decent rack,"I really like the style and material, though not the most well constructed. It tilts a little so its offkilter. Not bad for the price though"
4,Satisfied,"The rack is pretty much exactly what you would expect. It was easy to put together, and is well made. It is a perfect rack for someone who only keeps a few bottles of wine at a time."
3,Pyramid PB1617X 2000 Watt 4 Channel Bridgeable Mosfet Amplifier,I had the same complaint about the 4000 watt amp I bought. It overheats and shuts off alot. No information regarding the invidual controls. You have to guess what they do. The price was right.
1,Screwed by Pyramid Arctic,"I purchased a Pyramid Arctic Series PB1617X four channel amplifier on September 10, 2010, On December 3, 2010, This amplifier shut off in the middle of playing music. No fuse burned out, nor did the amplifier, it just stopped working. At present, I'm hoping for a replacement unit. At best, this unit lasted two months. I'm planning to contact the manufacturer. But I'm not sure they stand behind there products. Reginald Winkler."
4,Great anthology of underrepresented music,"This is a wonderful collection of contemporary Native music from the Americas. What I found most exciting was the diverse representation on the CD. The album includes music from all around the Americas, including Andean, Amazon, Apache, and Inuit. The artists that really stood out to me were Tudjaat from Canada and Regional Vermelho E Branco of Brazil. The album is full of enjoyable songs that in one way or another beautifully preserve and celebrate Native American cultures."
2,Will Putumayo return to Native American music?,"When Putumayo launched its odyssey series,its first couple of tries weren't the best.I give them the benefit of the doubt.They were newcomers to world music,and one of the first world music labels.This album has some highlights-Jaramar has a haunting song about the mystical turtle,Marlui Miranda has talent,Tudjaat is enchanting,and Andrew Vasquez,Bill Miller&Burning; Sky meld Native American traditions with contemporary folk.The rest is quite repetitive (the same problem I had with ""Cairo to Casablanca:A North African Odyssey"")I'm surprised this album is still in print.While Putumayo still explores Latin American&Brazilian; music,it's too bad it hasn't gone back to Native American music in the interim.Perhaps some time in the future.I hope they go back to this genre;there's plenty to listen to!It's not just Carlos Nakai."
4,still reading,"I am still reading this book, because I underline every other sentence. It is filled with excellent information. At times, it is a lot to digest in a sitting. I feel that it is one I will keep for years to come and continue to look back on as a reference. Great book to read in a group."
5,An important read for Christians,"This is an important book for Christians because so many of us have been brainwashed by the leaders of the religious right, who will have us believe that it is our Christian duty to vote Republican. I always thought it ironic that President Bush saw a need to coin a new phrase and call himself a ""compassionate"" conservative, whereas for a liberal this term would be redundant. (Alas, it was just another Bush lie.) Thanks Mr. Wallis for letting brainwashed Christians know that it really is okay for them to vote Democrat."
2,Polite Homphobia,"This author may indeed be well meaning, but nonetheless, like most religious rightwingers, his true colors are revealed when he discusses gay marriage. Gays don't have the right to marriage, the author says matter-of-factly, implying that gays are less worthy than good God-fearing souls like himself. He also says that gay civil rights are not nearly as important as other people's civil rights, implying that, again, gays are less worthy than others.All in all, not the most hateful book by a religious writer, but nonetheless quite hostile towards gay Americans. Why is it that no one who claims to love his fellow humans due to his religious beliefs can actually do so?"
3,Right but redundant,"Dr. Wallis is generally right when it comes to issues of faith and politics (at least from my religious and political point-of-view.) But after about 80 pages of pointing out how the right forgets God's compasson and the left forgets God, I was bored with the book. Perhaps he delves into more in-depth matters the last 75% of the book but I had Richard Neibuhr and Gustavo Guiterrez calling me to better writing and deeper understanding. David JAhnke"
3,"Much needed, but a little repetitive","This is a much needed book in the discourse on American Politics and Christianity. Wallace articulates why morality and ethics should not just be defined by the Christian Right, and he argues (well, in my opinion) that you can be a strong Democrat and a Christian.When you read the introduction, you pretty much get what the book is about. It's worth the read though!Check out the book discussion at: chalupafriend.blogspot.com"
2,Waste of Time,"While mildly thought provoking, this book is a waste of time. You could get a better idea of what this guy was trying to convey by reading the beatitudes from Jesus' Sermon on the Mount.Instead of outlining what the author thinks God's politics would be, he constantly harps on the errors of the two major political parties. The author does not offer any viable solutions.I cannot recommend this book to anyone.To get a better idea of God's politics, open your Bible and put God's words to action."
4,WAKE UP,"I liked Jim Wallis' book because he outlined what few progressives have in the wake of the defeats in the last two elections. He insists throughout his book that progessives come up with an alternative plan and not just be naysayers. He does a excellant job of relating the frustration of the the religious right who feel alienated by thr liberal left. By far the most important part of his book is his attemptto start to lay out a plan of action to counter the right-wing's plan instead of just complaining,step up and do."
1,Too good to be true,"I was excited about the premise of this book, hoping that by reading it, I would be exposed to an intelligent way of reconciling biblical truth with the political environment (not sure there is a way, after looking at the interaction between Jesus and Pilate or the Apostle Paul and Felix). I appreciated the observations that the right had co-opted God; that is so true. My expectations were a bit disappointed, however, when the author's sympathies seem to play in support of pro-gay, pro-choice, and anti-capital punishment agendas, not positions that Scripture endorses. Wallis gives everything a prescriptive harmony, but does it by marginalizing the Bible. It is political peace without substance, holiness, or justice, therefore the politics of this book do not end up being God's."
2,"Great title, insufficent follow through","I have followed many of Wallis'writings and generally found his conclusions about the state of the nation to be in close accord with my own. However after reading this book and trying to ignore the many replications (the book seems to have been largely a compilation of various talks and articles published elsewhere and hurriedly thrown together) I find little logic and discernment in its entirety. I am still left with the question: ""How can I discern God's politics?"" If the book had been less wordy and more analytical, and with a less lofty title and by-line, I would have appreciated it more. It seems more like a diatribe against the present administration (valid in my view) than a new way of looking at politics."
2,C. E. Lawrence,"Do not be misled by the title of this book. It is not, as I expected it to be, a scholarly treatment in Christian Appologetics addressing the manner in which God would have politics work, according to Biblical teachings, in our nation and the world. Instead, this book monotonously espouses a so-called ""progressive"" approach to infusing politics with ultra liberal attitudes toward morality, throughout an agonizingly long and redundant diatribe against George W. Bush and those holding a true Biblical Worldview. This ""progressive"" attitude has no basis in Biblically based Christian theology. If Mr. Wallis is an Evangelist, at all, he is clearly not a Christian Evangelist. If you are a liberal, and particularly if you are an avid Bush-basher, you will like the book. For those truly seeking to know how God would have us conduct politics, however, don't waste your time or money on this book."
1,Why it's all George Bush's fault,"If you hate George Bush, you'll love the book. It you love George Bush, you'll hate it. If you're in the middle and looking for an objective viewpoint, this isn't the book for you. He doesn't seem to let facts get in the way of his conclusions."
2,Why Religion Has No Place In Politics,"...or political decisions. Political decisions should be made on the relative merits of our society's needs. The best question for any politician should be, ""What is best for the greater good?"" The question should not be, ""What is best for the greater good, considering my religious convictions."" This book, like the vast majority of American politics, subscribes to the answers of the tenents of the former question, rather than the latter. The death of secular politics is writ large in this pathetic surrender to the Right. The more I read, the more I understand why GW is president."
1,His non-solution to the pre-Iraqi invasion by Bush,"Wallis discusses again and again in detail stressing the terrible deeds performed by Saddam Hussein while the latter was head of Iraq. Fine and this is good but he proposes (while using other quotes) no real solution. He talks about using a UN protectorate forcing more sanctions on Saddam's Iraq rather than conquering it by military force. This never could have worked! In former Saddam aid Georges Sada's own book (available on amazon) he discusses how Saddam was collecting a superpowerful superfortune through smuggling Iraqi oil outta neighboring Iran. Iran would have been no help in the UN sanctioning Iraq heavier. Syria probbaly wouldn't either. Invasion was the only way to get Saddam out, as Bush did in 2003. Point is moot now anyway."
1,Pronoun problem,"I was so looking forward to reading this book. Could not take it after the first chapter. Was expecting a great unbiased intellectual discourse...was I ever disappointed. The pronouns changed from ""I"" to ""we""...who is ""we"" and were did ""they"" come from? Who are you speaking for? Now I get it. No offence, this isn't God's Politics, it's Jim Wallis's politics."
4,author,"Good advice,all this requires any person to surrender to a higher source prior to a major change to take place."
1,One Sided,I bought this book because I thought I could gain some insight. This is just left leaning BS.
3,Two hundred pages too long,"This book has a noble goal -- Unite right and left with prophetic insight. Unfortunately it lacks compassion for either side. It is long on retoric and short on facts. The same old tired unexamined slogans are recited without thoughtful reflection. Is it possible that ""Taxbreaks for the rich"" might advance the cause of the poor? How will reciting this slogan unite us? Considering the possibility that the War in Iraq is a mistake; how can we create a more just world? Reciting the mantrum ""Bush Lied"" will not bring peace. I continue to search for how to create peace in my heart, my church, my city, my country, the world. This book did not provide a meaningful answer."
3,"A good corrective, but.....","Wallis's book is a good corrective for both the excesses of the secular political left and the errors of the Christian right. The book establishes fair-minded ground that should be covered by any Christian engagement with political issues. However, Wallis himself frequently falls for entrenched positions of the left, which seems to be his natural political home. For example, he labels the war in Iraq ""illegal"" without noting that applying his criteria would render other U.S. military actions ""illegal"" as well. The 1999 air war against Serbia was also ""illegal"" according to Wallis's currently convenient standards (Serbia did not pose a threat to the U.S., it had not attacked the U.S., nor was U.S. military action against Serbia authorized by the U.N. Security Council). Wallis here falls victim to the hypocrisy and short-sightedness of the American political left."
2,God's Politics,"I found this book a bit of a weak rehash of theological principles held by the author. It focuses on a pragmatic theology and contains old correspondence to back up his thesis...which, in light of Lakoff and others, skims many issues. In short I think this book was glued together in light of the 2004 election results and the popularity of post-election analysis."
1,The motto for the book is quite deceiving: Not What You Think,I was very disappointed with this book. I got it on my campus for 2 dollars on a book sale and I really would not recommend it for a Republican because the author is obviously biased and thinks that Democrats have it all right. It just made me really angry as a Republican. He's also a Bush-hater which upsets me tremendously.
1,God is not political!,"Actually i found this book to be a comedy. God's politics? Both the left and the right are trying so hard to see read into the Bible what the meaning of pollitics is. God has let us earthlings have all kinds of governments but they have all failed because of lies, corruption, greed and everything in between. Jim Wallis writing about what God would do or his and many other interputations are all wrong.It has taken me years to understand the Bible and I still haven't mastered it because it's a book that you'll always find something that you didn't know before. Our government is way to corrupt to even think that they understand what GOD wants. If they only read in several accounts where Jesus says ""My kingdom is not of this world."" There is only ONE form of government and that is the Kingdom of GOD. Putting GOD's good name (Jehovah) in this book is wrong and has false believes.If you really want to know about government,,,,,read the Bible."
1,Just more liberal propaganda,"This book presents itself as an unbiased Christian view of American politics and I was really looking forward to reading it but I was disappointed to find that there is nothing unbiased about it. It is just another leftist, anti-American screed that masquerades as Christian thought."
3,I didn't agree with some of Mr. Wallis' premises,"I read this because I belong to a book group in my church. It was good to see some alternative viewpoints to the ""religious right"", but it seemed that the author assumed readers would agree with his views.It was worth reading, but I can't recommend it wholeheartedly."
5,THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!,"This book is a must read for all Christian and nonChristian people, especially moms who want to raise moral kids. Finally, a person who inspires everyone to listen to their gut about middle of the road wisdom. Great read and motivation for all of us. Share your insight with everyone after you read it and recommend the book as much as possible. God's Politics rocks and enlightens the soul.For Moral Moms with kids ages 2 to 11, I also recommend Mommy-CEO, by Jodie Lynn"
5,Hope for America's Christians,"Jim Wallis has done it yet again. In God's Politics, Jim breaks down the problems with not only the gross misinterpretation of Christian Ethic by the Religious Right and the Republican party, but also notes the severe lack of concern for religious discourse by the Democratic Party. By taking a fair and balanced look at both parties, Wallis suggests several things that must be done in order to see a new political discussion form. I highly suggest this book for anyone looking for a *true* connection of religion and politics."
5,Eye-Opener,"Jim Wallis and his Sojourner crew is making a huge impact on American politics. I had been disillusioned with the typical right-wing Christian rhetoric and that just lead me into political apathy. Wallis' book really opened my eyes about everything from taking care of the poor, the War in Iraq, homosexuality, and many other issues. Everyone who is tired of the typical right-wing rhetoric should read this book."
2,God's politics-----a man's bias,"This is the most one-sided, leftist reflection of current events masquerading as religions thought I have ever read in my life. There is some real helpful insight in these pages. But, it is so obscured by partisan rhetoric, that even a thoughtful individual would have great difficulty reading it. My Sunday School class has been struggling to discuss the chapters. Even the liberals are turned-off by the slant. His use of scripture is generally good, but the bias gets in the way of almost every point."
4,very good introduction to god ... and ... politics,The book was very cleverly written by a bright man who layed out the facts for the republican party. I love the book and certainly think it a good refrence for whats been happening this past year and with the election and all. I found it very insightful. well done. well done
5,Best Book this Year by ANY author,"Do not get thrown by the title. READ THIS BOOK if you want to understand what is going on in this country. I am one of those folks who go to church every Sunday and could not figure out what happened in 2004 when Jesus suddenly walked on Wall Street. It is the best book on politics and society I have read in a decade. Buy it, read it and then give it to a friend."
2,Timely Subject - Secular response,"While the underlying theme of Wallis' book is timely (that is, religion and politics should be discussed together), the author is entirely disingenuous throughout the book. It's full of false generalizations which reveal his liberal view of the role of politics. Chalk Wallis up to another person who mistakes ""Freedom of Religion"" to ""Freedom from Religion."""
1,Jim Wallis is just another liberal who doesn't get it,"I had high hopes when I picked this up that maybe he would encourage Democrats to embrace Christian ideals. I was quickly disappinted and eventually disgusted but kept reading out of morbid fascination at an ideology continuing to drive obliviously and self-righteously off a cliff. The author's premise is basically that by using buzzwords and claiming Jesus stands for their values Democrats can trick Christians into voting for them.The problem is that Christianity is not a collection of buzzwords or a bunch of kids rocking back and forth chanting and memorizing the Bible all day. Christianity has a millenium-long tradition of rationalism and reasoned debate about morality. Christians don't vote Republican because they think ""that's what Christ would want,"" they vote Republican because it's the rational, moral thing to do."
2,Confusing and sometimes even contradictory,"Jim Wallis seems well-meaning, but his book is so full of contradictions that you can't follow his logic. It also seems like he's doing his best to please the Democratic Party in order to carve our a place for himself in their ranks. He claims to be a ""Christian"" but his confusing position on abortion makes me wonder. He writes that Christians should not vote on just a single issue like abortion. So what we don't vote on the one issue of murder? I could see his point if we were talking about taxes or highway building, but not murder. I wonder if during the Civil Rights movement, all those people who voted solely on the issue of Civil Rights were also misguided?"
1,How Boring,"You know if God was really kind he would not have allowed this book to be published. Jim Wallis has most of Christianity wrong and his biting tone is hard to believe. I object to the book because it does not represent what Christ taught and it is mean spirited toward believers who don't have a liberal slant. When I say liberal, I mean really liberal. Save your money and your time!"
2,Repetitious,"Unless you have had your head buried in the sand for the last 5 years this will not be new. If you want a re statement of ""values"" questions raised in the popular media, don't look for clarity here. Did anyone edit this book, organize it or eliminate redundancy? Speeches seem to have been written down in a stream of consciousness manner and piled in a book that rambles from election 2004 going backward to the turn of the millennium. For clarity begin by reading his 50 predictions for the new millennium located at the very end of the book because the rest was very disappointing."
2,Not nonpartisan,"Wallis pitches his book as an attempt to show that Christians can be Democrats or Republicans, or whatever presumably. Here, he is correct. He also pitches his argument as being nonpartisan. Here, he is mistaken; it doesn't take too long to figure out his idea of nonpartisan is liberal Democrat."
1,for uncritical leftists only,"Wallis uncritically accepts all Democratic party lines. Tax cuts are for the rich, poverty is growing, the Third world is poor because the US is mean to it, Al Qaeda can be stopped by police investigations, the UN is the most moral agent, etc. The book is extravagantly repetitive. Perhaps his publisher required him to only have one idea in each chapter and forgot to tell him it shouldn't always be the same idea. The only function of this book is to comfort left wing Christians. He assumes all conservatives are motivated by greed, racism and lust for war -- ignoring the richly developed world of conservative thought as can be seen in Commentary magazine or First Things."
3,Love it but too much magnesium for just 500mg of calcium,"I really like this food based calcium but had not noticed that it has a ton of magnesium. It works for anyone not needing more than 500mg of calcium a day (three pills) but if you need to take 1,500mg, you'll be taking ways too much magnesium (3,000 mg/day) and you will probably spend your days in the toilet. I had to change back to Rainbow light regular calcium which does not have enough magnesium per serving, so back again to adding separate magnesium pills."
2,Upset my stomach,"These upset my stomach for some reason. It didn't seem to matter whether I took them with food or not. This might be TMI, but it gave me stools like water every time I took one. Your results might differ, but if you get an upset stomach while taking this, you might want to see if this is the cause. I do however love Rainbow Light's Women's Multivitamin. It's the only multivitamin I've tried that doesn't upset my stomach."
5,love it,"I love this product. It cleared up my baby's acne and it never came back. It is a nice quick way to clean my baby's face and neck in the morning, before bed and any time she spits up. At first I did not like the scent but I do now it is not so perfumey like it was when I first smelled it or maybe it is the way it reacts with her skin..."
5,Eliminates the stinkies!!!,"I received several Mustela products as a shower gift and loved them all, but the one that I have referred to friends over and over again is the PhysioBebe No-Rinse Cleansing Fluid. I switched from breast milk to formula pretty early (was doing half and half from birth, then totally formula at 4 months), so I got an early intro to just how smelly formula poops are! Now that my son is on ""real"" food, the frequency, amount, and smell have increased, so every time I change him, I clean him up with wipes first, then follow with the Fluid (I only need 1 squirt), and I have literally put my nose ""down there"" and found ZERO trace of the stinkies! I'm buying a case when my second baby is born in January!"
4,Good product - not what I needed,"This product does what it says it will do. It cleans really well.I bought it based on reviews that it will help with baby acne. It didn't for mine - good old breastmilk to the rescue again!It does a good job of cleaning - I did end up using it in his diaper area and it definitely got off additional nastiness after I couldn't see anything anymore with a regular wipe.However, as my son's skin isn't sensitive, I'll just stick with breastmilk for his face and a mild soap/water mixture to clean his rear end. That's what I used on my daughter to help keep rashes at bay, and it'll be fine for him, as well, if he needs it."
5,Amazing - works on cradle cap and baby acne,"I was highly skeptical of this product - something that's no-rinse on an infant's delicate skin sounds too good to be true. Well, I'm so very happy to be proven wrong. This stuff, used on a cotton pad, has cleared up everything on my three-month old twins from cradle cap (bad case) to baby acne (had been ongoing for weeks until one application) to my own mystery rash (who knows, but it's gone now!). My twins now have gorgeous, healthy skin, and I absolutely attribute it to Mustela."
3,Great at cleaning but strong smell,"This cleans my baby really well and leaves his skin soft. I love it for diaper changes. I use 1 squirt on a cotton ball and it is enough for all but the messiest changes. I also keep some in a mini-spray bottle in my diaper bag, and it is great when we are away from home to clean any kind of baby mess. It removes spit up, all poo traces, and even aquaphor if I used too much, and never irritates my baby's skin.However, the fragrance is overpowering and my baby cries if I use it on his face/neck folds after breastfeeding. The smell becomes very nice about a half hour after applying after it wears off a bit, but straight from the bottle is quite strong. I wish there were an unscented version of this."
5,I use this everyday,This is a great product. I use this this to wash my baby's face every morning. It smells great and is very gentle. (I wet a washcloth with hot water and then pump 3-4 pumps of this cleansing solution.) I only use Mustela products on my baby's skin.
2,Stinky Stinky Stinky!,I cannot stand how much this thing smells. I don't know how this can possibly be a no rinse clenser. Why would anyone want to have this kind of smell linger on the delicate infant skin? I use it on my baby but I always wash it off with a wet washcloth afterwards so I can remove that strong chemical smell. It's like putting a Chanel #5 on a seven year old. Horrible.
4,Geschichte mal anders,"Auch wenn ich das Buch nicht zu Ende gelesen habe, diese sind trotzdem sehr schön geschriebene Erzählungen. Zweig nimmt vierzehn historischen Meilensteine und verwandelt sie in aufregenden Abenteuer."
1,Warning: Do not buy Platano Records Edition,"The Platano Records edition (2005) of Piel Sin Alma is a Macrovision ""protected"" CD that will not play in a PC or a Mac/iPod, which is how I listen to music, or even some car stereos. Raulin Rodriguez is great, but be sure to get the EMI (not Platano Records) edition this CD. -- DJ Arnoldo"
3,"The best of its time, but oudated now","This book is a valuable window into the early origami scene-- enthusiasts will find works from pioneers in the field such as Fred Rohm, Neal Elias, Ligia Montoya, and even a couple early models from the elusive Philip Shen. At the time, it was one of the best origami books ever written.But origami grew up quickly; those looking for an introduction to the subject would do better with a more modern approach, like those by Megumi Biddle, Michael LaFosse, or John Montroll. Some of these models still meet modern standards-- and that is a wonder, given that they are almost 50 years old-- but most will seem awkward and oversimplified. This was origami when it was still learning to crawl; but these days, most of us can walk and a few have started to run."
5,Best Game With Most Replayability,"I Just looked up some information on this game, and so far I'm blown away.I just hope that this game is as good as Nightfire. The single-player mode was awesome, but the multi-player is where it's at. I suggest to any PS2 fan out there who likes to play games with their friends, to buy Nightfire or the new Everything or Nothing 007 games and buy a multi-tap. I bought Nightfire 6 months ago, and my friends and I still get together and play it every week. I have never played a game more than Nightfire. The World is Not Enough on N64 was a hell of a game on multi-player as well. I'm sure Everything or Nothing will out do all the 007 games before, and I can't wait! My final comment is: If your lookingto have a good time with your friends, 007 multi-player is the way to go. I am a huge Bond fan, the movies are amazing as well, and if you know the characters off the movies, the games are even more fun!"
4,007,"0007 Everything or Nothing uses an original story and an all-star cast of Pierce Brosnan, William Dafoe, Shannon Elizabeth, Richard Kiel, Heidi Klum, Mya, Misaki Ito, John Cleese, and Judi Dench as ""M"". You get to play the role of James Bond as you take on the bad guys. The game is fun and challenging at times, but there are few glitches that can become annoying."
4,THE BEST GAME EVER !,"This is probaly the best game I ever saw. It is awsome! The graphics are great and also the gameplay. The game has a wide varaity of veichles like motorcycles, tanks, helicopters and The Aston Martin. You must buy this game, if you don't to bad for you. So out of 1 threw ten I would give this game a ten."
5,Best--Bond Game--Ever!,"This game by far beats out every other 007 game on every console (for single-player). I only said it was good on single-player because the multiplayer mode is very disappointing. The arena, which you have to unlock, is very hard to see who you are and what you're doing. That's the problem with third-person games: the multiplayer mode is shown from a bird's-eye-view from far up. Other Bond games, like Nightfire, are played in first-person, so it's easy to see. There's also a co-op mode, which is just pretty dumb. Anyway, the single-player is great. The graphics are really realistic, real actors (Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench, John Cleese) do the voices for characters. The gameplay isn't too easy, yet it's not too hard. Overall, I give this game two tumbs up."
1,"Very, very disappointed","Most of the reviews I've read here are from people who don't own this game. I just went out and bought it. I am a very loyal bond fan, but this game is just not fun. I could only play it for about 30 minutes before I got disgusted. The gameplay is terrible. You are basically on auto aim the whole time. The 3rd person camera views are not as intuitive as you would like. Often you can see the person you would like to shoot, but the system locks onto someone else. The gameplay is nowhere near as good as SOCOM (another 3rd person shooter). Not sure what the big hype is over this hand-to-hand combat mode either. Now Bond gets to punch people. Strongly recommend you rent this and see if you like it more than I do."
2,Everything or Nothing?,"If you like high action games, that require allot of thinking and skill. This might not be the game for. But if you enjoy a simple game with decent and story line, a game that anyone can beat then this is a game for you. The fighting skills and moves are not that great, you can't jump over even the smallest walls, the action level is not that good. The fighting is awful. But if you want a classic bond game. this is it."
4,I HATE JAMES BOND!!!! Is there another videogame with a PERFECT gameplay as this one!!!???,"PLEASE, PLEASE!! Somebody tell me!!!!!!There must be another action videogame with the same fun factor as this one!!!Maybe I would like more this game if it was Lara Croft's Tomb Raider or Batman instead of James Bond! MAN I HATE THIS CHARACTER!! I also hate his desing, his attitude, his dialoge, his settings, his inventions and worst of all PIERCE BROSNAN!!! THE WORST JAMES BOND EVER!!!!!!!!This videogame may be the COOLEST AND FUNNIEST EVER MADE!!! But James Bond suck's (the new James Bonds) SOMEBODY TELL ME! PLEASE!!! IS THERE ANOTHER VIDEOGAME WITH THE SAME FUN FACTOR AS THIS ONE????!!!Adios."
2,THE MULTIPLAYER IS TERRIBLE!!!!!,"I buy Bond games mostly for the multiplayer because it is the most fun. When I played this Bond, it was in 3rd Person. That means there is one screen and it's from a birds eye view. The missions are fun for about five minutes, but after that they gat old. Only buy this game if you don't care about multiplayer."
5,I Like It,"If you want a fun, action-packed shooting game, get 007 Everything or Nothing. It is probably the best James Bond video game yet. Level 3 is really challenging. The best part about it is that it is not manual firing like Nightfire, it's automatic if you hold L1 down. I really like it!"
1,THE WORST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"EA Games is awful at making games. They put nice graphics in it, but after that, its probobly the worst storyline, worst gameplay, and worst overall game experience.It's okay to rent, but you can beat this in about 2 hours on easy, and my friend beat it on 00 agent in about half an hour. Really bad game."
4,007 James Bond Everything Or Nothing,"I thought this game would be amazing from youtube videos. I got it three days ago and overall it's a great game, but it could be better if it were first person. This game is third person. This is the only reason I rated this game four out of five stars. The one great advantage to this game is that it has lock on aiming for precise head shots and head shots with the pp7 in this game will kill with one shot. I played the game for two days, then got bored because already beat it. I would recommend this game."
5,james bond everything or nothing,james bond was the best game ever it had the best graphics music and multiplayer
4,cool game,this a great game. alot of quick fun to play. Graphics are excellent and very appealling just to watch. Interaction with the game is very entertaining. Highly reccomend this game. One draw back is that when you want to save a level it has to many steps to go thru.
5,"My name is Bond, James Bond","I bought this game 1 day after it was released, and IM LOVIN IT im a big fan of the Bond movies and in this game i really felt as if i was Bond, I mean this is the best bond game ever and the best action game! I mean, REALLY good actors put their voices in the game Pierce Brosnan, Shannon Elizabeth, Willem Dafoe, Heidi Klum, Mya, John Cleese...This game was meant to have their voices !! It has incledible 007 stunts, characters, over 30 missions,I would call it a masterpiece! BUY IT!!AND FEEL LIKE BOND!!"
4,A Blast,When I played this game years ago I enjoyed it from beginning to end. I still remember how much fun I had on this one game. Excellent
5,Hey,Hey the old james Bond games I have played and there so! cool. But the new James Bond game I can't wait untel it comes out!James Bond rocks!!
1,Cruel Hoax,"That this has anything to do with the previous, excellent and hugely popular 007 games is a cruel hoax and the makers should be ashamed. Why take something that is good and screw it up? Strange. Totally different and beyond bad. Booooo!"
2,This game is terrible,I hated this game. It was terrible. I loved nightfire because me my bro and my cuz would play 3 v. 6 and we would kill the albots. IN this game you can only play vs 1-2 albots. The guns stink and the game is very very boring. THe story mode is very stupid and the levels aren't put together well. The graphics are ok and playing this online is terrible. Overall this game is terrible.
4,math and art,This is a cool book. I tutor middle school students in math and have used this to help them think outside the box. Math can be used to describe everything around us. This book has beautiful color photos of unique calculus graphs.The kids are amazed by the beauty of these designs.
5,Book Nitty-Gritty Regarding the Hardback Edition,"An impressive book from Phaidon. Large format, square hardcover with a sewn binding, bound in nubby cloth with an inset color image. Clear plastic dustjacket.4.5 pounds. 335 pp with over 150 illustrations, most of them large, almost all of them in color. Texts by four authors, interview, statements by the artist. 12 pp of footnotes, a 26 p Chronology, 6 p Bibliography, list of Mangold works, index.A comprehensive, beautiful book!"
2,Much repetition,"Very historical, but difficult to follow due to repeated events and the time period covered. It jumped timeperiods and countries. The historical names of the people involved seemed factual, but their time in historymade their involvement difficult to follow."
2,Sexy Shoe,"Got the metallic bronze in these shoes, they looked exceptional at first but after a few wears i noticed that the heel tips were coming off, and the shoe was becoming discoloured. I bought them at full price so i was quite disappointed."
2,"Worth a skim, but only for the entertainment value of a fad","After skimming through the content, I would say that this book (and its web site) are good things for Ashley and her groupies to keep busy with. But honestly, I have a hard time seeing how she is doing anything of eternal value. As it is, this is a passing fad where we've chosen to celebrate a teen who can put a commercialized web site together instead of recognizing the students in our world who are making lasting impacts through overseas and local service projects in their communities. If Ashley gets the spotlight simply because Sprite.com is a sponsor, I have to wonder what we are really encouraging - a meaningless chase after the wind? Or perhaps the better question is what are we discouraging? Give me a teen who's making a selfless impact instead so they might feel encouraged to keep on keeping on. Ashley Power, meanwhile, can have Levis Jeans."
4,Soon to be a favorite around the fraternity,"A collection of songs that sneaks up on you like a good beer-buzz from a English stout. A great CD to break out at the climax of a party and start singing along to. It's a chain reaction, the more people sing along to it, the more other people want to learn the songs and pretty soon the whole party is singing the songs, especially, Mary May."
3,It's okay,I wasn't blown away. It is more little snipets of information than actual tips you can use. I recommend buying his Golf My Way book and skipping this one.
5,Helping aid for digestion,"Whenever I take this with food I seems to feel lighter and have better bowel movements.I don't experience any negative side effects just positive one from a good enzyme supplement.I recommend this product and that you take it just as soon as you start eating.After a week of use you will notice a difference:Better bowel movements, less bloating, less gas, more energy due to improved energy absorption."
5,Really works!!,"I have IBS and have always had problems with diarreah and trapped intestinal gas that was so painful. I started taking this with every meal, even if it's a glass of milk and I feel SO much better. I would highly recommend this to anyone suffering from stomach problems or IBS. I have suffered for so long and finally found some relief."
5,Helpful for ulcerative colitis,"My husband has been using a certain brand of enzymes for ulcerative colitis for a long time. He had tried other brands, but they didn't work. He discovered that the manufacturer of the ones he was using would no longer make them, so he went in search of a new product. This brand has worked for him, and he rarely has to take prescription drugs and does not have outbreaks of his disease."
4,Seems to do the trick,Seems to do the trick of helping to digest my food about 98% of the time. But I have a rotten diet and probably should change it up!
2,Not pleaed with this product,I bought these based on other reviews and it was really not a good buy. The amount of enzyme activity is not enough to do anything. 60 LU of lipase is nothing compared to one that costs a little bit more with 5000 LU. Its a pity we cant see the back of the label with all the ingredients before purchase. I would not buy again.
5,Great product for those of us with digestion issues,I decided to try this one when I noticed that it was being purchased at a ratio higher than 2 to 1 versus the one I was using. So far no regrets!!
5,Works Great!,I have been using this product for over 3 years for indigestion..I take one capsule before each meal......and it really works. Buying from Amazon saves me so much money. I am very happy with this product.
2,Not great digestive enzymes,"These are very weak as digestive enzymes, in my case almost worthless. They may, however, have some function as more systemic enzymes, since they seem to increase my energy just a little, if I take at least 7 capsules each day. More than seven does not seem to bring better results."
5,Amazing,Its great! Ordering again. Pair this with freshly squeezed lemon juice in the morning and your system will be regular! Its amazing! Lose weight and dont feel bloated or yucky at all!!! Im 5'1 1/2 inch and wad 132... now and i have my cheat days have been sick so eatting more carbs and crap than normal and I'm down to 126 in about 2 weeks.. plus i also changed from egg whites to eggwhiteinternational (their bottled eggs are amazing).... amazing!!! I would be down morw if i ate better!!!
5,Rainbow Light digestive enzymes,"Rainbow Light is one of the best enzyme products I have tried, they seem to be true to their claim of what the product actually contains in each capsule. I've paid much more for others that were not as consistent and effective as the Rainbow Light. Price is very good for this product also, I would recommend to anyone wanting a good digestive enzyme for daily use."
2,Did not work as well as others,"I have IBS-D and I usually use the Twinlab Super Enzyme capsules for that. However, the bottle of 200 that I buy was not available with Prime as they had been so I decided to try the Rainbow Light capsules. I can't say that they don't work at all because the IBS-D symptoms did not return full force, but they did not work as well as I would have liked. As soon as the Twinlab capsules were available with Prime again, I ordered those and did not finish the bottle of Rainbow Light. Everyone is different and these might work well for someone who only suffers from some slight digestive troubles, but for my problem, I needed something better. One thing I will say for them is that when you open the bottle, the minty scent is a lot better than that of the Twinlab!"
2,Did not work for me,It is a real hassle to remember to take these with every meal and did not seem to help any so not worth the effort for me.
3,Lip Sync?,"I saw this live in Toronto and absolutely loved it! However, this DVD makes it look like he was lip syncing... I was standing far back in the crowd, so who knows, maybe he actually was... Every shot of him singing was either angled so you couldn't see his lips, or he had the mic positioned so that you couldn't tell, or was wearing a mask, or wasn't on stage... I really hope they didn't pull a Britney Spears!The sound and video quality are amazing. However, it doesn't look like a live concert, just a group on stage with their music playing in the background."
3,"Promising, but doesn't meet potential","I was REALLY looking forward to this book, but found it a slight disappointment. I did enjoy the book, but found it somewhat unsatisfying. On several occasions I felt confused about what had happened. In one particular case, Hoare is attacked and somehow subdued, and I have no clue how it happened! A passing remark by one of the villains later alluded to how the hero was subdued, but his comment didn't make sense to me. The period stuff is decent, though not as in-depth as I expected it to be. If you want sailing adventure, I'd go for ""The Revolution at Sea"" series instead."
5,A great slicer!,I can't believe that I live in grapefruit country and didn't have a knife to cut one with. It is easy-handling and does a great job.
1,Crap,This book was a load of crap. I will be shocked if the content of this book does anything for anyone.
5,Signature Gigi,"Purchased the download version from Amazon.com. Wasn't sure I was going to like it, slightly different from his usual compilations, but on the 2nd listen, it's obvious - signature Gigi D'agostino with all his touches. The guy is brilliant. If you're a Gigi fan, you will love this too. Good stuff.2012 - Still love this album. Pure genius."
3,Turn of the screw...,I found this to be a rather boring classic. I just couldn't really get interested in it enough to not be confused. I didn't even understand what happened in the end. I stayed confused for most of the book. I started over several times but still couldn't keep up with who was speaking who they were speaking about. So I can't recommend this book. Sorry.
2,Not worth the hype,"This is the second Henry James book I have read (the 1st being Washington Square) and in both cases, I have not been very impressed. Henry James had great ideas for stories, but he really did not execute them well. Now, I really like literature from this time period, but James stifles his narrative with so much unnecessary language that one gets lost and the suspense of the story falls flat.I did not find this story in the least chilling and was often frustrated with James' style. Others might find James a good read, but not I."
4,DON'T READ IT BEFORE YOU GO TO BED!!,"JAMES' CLEVERLY CREATED NOVEL SET IN AN OLD COUNTRY HOUSE ALLOWS THE UNIMAGINABLE TO HAPPEN. HIS SENTENCE CONSTRUCTION AND LACK OF CONCLUSION TO THE NOVEL VICTORIOUSLY FULFILLS JAMES' AIMS, TO ASK QUESTIONS.THE ""VISIONS"" OF THE GOVERNESS AND THE ""INNOCENCE"" OF THE CHILDREN ARE PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE BY A STRANGE, MYSTERIOUS DISCOURSE.FULL OF INTRIGUE AND QUESTIONS, THIS IS A NOVEL DEFINITELY NOT TO BE READ ON YOUR OWN IN BED.DON'T BE PUT OFF BY JAMES' LONG WINDED SENTENCES, THEY ALL PLAY A PART IN THE PUZZLING HAPPENINGS TO THE GOVERNESS...DID SHE DO IT?"
2,Why is this a classic?,"I'm being genrous with two stars, because it's a classic, but I really had to struggle through this turgid text. It's short (my copy runs at 104 pages), but it took me nearly a year to read it. I kept putting it aside, reading other books in between.I agree with those who say that NOTHING HAPPENS, and that the text is so WORDY and CONVULUTED. I too had to reread sentences several times to figure out what the governess was trying to say.I don't mind old books, and I can accept that in previous centures customs, attitudes, and phrasing differed. That might still allow for a great story. But this is STILL a boring convuluted book.Mary Shelly's FRANKENSTEIN was written nearly a century before TOTS, yet FRANKENSTEIN reads well, is interesting, and says important things about life and philosophy even if the views of people 200 years ago are not our own. So just because TOTS was first published in 1898 is no excuse for its dull convuluted telling."
4,As Chilling as Anything,"The psychological terror that ""The Turn of the Screw"" creates for a reader is unmatched by almost everything I have ever read. The story unfolds so slowly -- yet, paradoxically, also very quickly -- that the feelings of dread just grow."
5,The art of suspense.,"Forget all you have heard about suspense: until you readthe creepy and breathless story of little Miles, his sisterFlora and their governess living in an old country housewhere also lived the silent presences of dead Peter Quintand Miss Jessel, be sure you know nothing about that.You will find evil and innocence together in a way neverimagined before. And you will find out how hard it issometimes to tell what is real and what comes fromimagination."
3,"""Challenging her own irregularity...""","That governess - is she just a love-struck melodramatic whack-job or is she genuine in her visions and concerns for her wards? James' language is over-labored and spends to much efforts getting nowhere at times - and to no great effect. Shakespeare is less complicated and more colorful. The color is often stripped out of the writing - and painted back in with a lighter wash. It moves the story forward - but often requires a step back here and there to clear things up. There is honest fear built up through the course of the tale - and I certainly felt that ""waiting for the next shoe to drop"" sense - but nothing that would keep me up at night."
3,Not what I thought,"Great for the beginner. Had found a description of the content elsewhere and was interested in the Setup of the Bass and Amp to get a good tone. Didn't get what I wanted out of the video for that.If you're someone who's just picking up the bass and need to familiarize yourself with the notes on the neck, good practice habits, etc. This will help some."
4,Simplifies a complex language!,"Turkish is one of the most confusing languages for English speakers to learn in terms of grammar and vocabulary. Teach Yourself Turkish really does a good job of simplifying the grammar and vocab and really makes it accessible to English speakers.I found this course very helpful for my recent 5 week trip to Turkey. I was able to get my basic needs met and understand most of what was said to me. Don't expect to sit back, listen to the tapes and become fluent, however. You should really spend about 30 minutes a day at it and a week on each chapter.The only problem I had with the course was that the tapes were too short. Also, there were no oral drills on them. With more taped dialogues and oral drills this course would easily hit 5 stars!"
5,An awesome account of the sport and business of the NFL,"Since the Colts left Baltimore in 1984 I had pretty much forgotten about football. I had paid little attention to the trials the city had gone through to obtain a replacement for the Colts, and even less attention to any other city's NFL problems. Until I read this book.By the time Baltimore convinced Cleveland Brown's owner Art Modell to abandon the city he had made into a football dynasty in favor of a more lucrative deal, they had already spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build the Orioles a new stadium. The author details a highly entertaining story of how it all happened, complete with backroom details and public embarassments.Jon Morgan does a magnificent job of relating seemingly unrelated events. He somehow ties together team owner's greed, urban decay, baseball football rivalry, Baltimore's loss, Baltimore's theft, fan loyalty and stadium economics into a fascinating well-told tale. And best of all - it's all true!"
2,1998. . .a tough year for some ashrams. . .,"I read this book and found it to be a good general guide for Eastern spiritual experiences, which are great, for the most part.My concern is that the author visited Swami Shyam the same year that Melissa Baer was rumored to have been murdered by that ashram. . and Anne Craig and many others came out that they had been raped or otherwise sexually conquered by this guru.My book: Himalayan Hoedown. . .offers an alternative insiders account of this particularly ashram. . .which gives too much power to a guru. . a point that many should be aware of, given the recent sweatlodge deaths.These are realities that no factual book on Easter religious followings should ignore."
2,Disappointingly narrow viewpoint,"This book would be excellent for people seeking ashrams. However, there is nothing about major temples, festivals, or other local observations. There is a little bit of information about local pilgrimage sites but it is laughably inadequate."
2,If only there were an alternative econ career book...,"The ""Great Jobs..."" series (offerings range from accounting to theatre) all suffer from a rather fundamental flaw: None of their authors posses the skills of which they're purporting to be qualified to give advice on. Camenson knows nothing about economics. If someone is writing career books for a living, chances are that they are among the worst people to be getting career advice from (unless you want to write career books). What's worse, the vast bulk of this book does not even pertain to economics. Instead it offers examples of sloppy cover letters and ""methods of self assessment"" that have been simply rehashed from the other books of this series. In essence, there is only one book in the ""Great Jobs..."" series; it has just been fitted with a different cover for each undergraduate major in hopes to appeal to the broadest audience. Great idea - Bad book."
4,Beans have different sprouting speeds,"I like this mix a lot, it's tasty and quick to sprout - it takes about 2-3 days. However, one variety of beans is slower to sprout than the rest, so I have to keep it longer to give all beans a chance to sprout, which makes the first sprouters a little too long for my taste. Still, I'd rather use this mix than sprout all varieties separately."
2,Seeds don't all sprout at once :-(,"I've purchased from the Sprout House before and they have great seeds. The good = almost all the seeds sprouted. The not so good = the adzuki beans took longer to be ready than the others, so they were 'overdone'. For me, this makes the mix unusable. I'm surprised the Sprout House packaged these seeds together.For a better mix, order the Peasant Mix from the Sprout People. It's less $$ per pound, too."
3,Not worth the $$$$,At $50.00+ for this book - it is not worth it. It is an Ok book for undergraduate starting off learning to write about music. My recommendation is to find something else; publishers do not understand that the costs of textbooks are keeping students from getting them. Shame on you publishers!!!
2,The Terror starring Boris Karloff,The movie itself is a classic. The only problem is the dvd portion sticks. The disc surface has bubbles. I bought one close to a year ago from J&R Music and the dvd had the exact bubbles on the surface and sticking. It's not your fault but the company's fault for producing and inspecting what it distributes. I will return it.
3,Blu-ray Edition,"If it weren't for Peter Bogdonovich's ""Targets"", I probably never would have given ""The Terror"" a second look, so in a way it's at best a footnote in my movie collection. Having said that, seeing a young Jack Nicholson in a low-budget Roger Corman production sure helps the novelty.Your classic 'boy gets lost, boy finds girl, boy follows girl to the mysterious castle, wackiness ensues' type deal, apparently using much of the cast and sets from Corman's ""The Raven"". (I suppose I need to see THAT now too.)This is my fourth ""HD Cinema Classics"" release and probably my last. A soft transfer extensively DNR'd, this is their worst looking yet. Image quality is extremely uneven though various scenes. Really poorly done."
1,not a food,"I could not be more dissappointed. These are NOT chocolate, nor do they have any taste at all. They should be soft but are crunchy, hard and dry with NO flavor. Like eating plastic. Just awful, don't buy!"
5,This book is a must for Bonefishing !,"This is an essential book for any person interested in Bonefish. It explains habitat, techniques and fishing areas clearly. Mr. Brown has a love of the sport and this clearly shows through in the text and photos. Highly Recommended !"
3,Needs more updating,"Great information, especially on ambushing tactics and stats with feeding behaviour.Very bad linking of pictures to text, due to oldfashioned buildup of document. This should really be revised. Nowadays you can easily place the info or name of a fly right next to a picture of it, now I have to go back and forth through the book to link picture & description......Overall I am not disappointed."
5,Just as described,This was shipped very fast and was just as described. We have been giving this to our dogs for a back condition and we feel that it really helps.
3,Curaflex 2,Been using these for my 11 year old dog for at least 4 years. He is also on Rimadyl and combined with Curaflex 2 he seems to do really well. They just give him that extra comfort for his arthritic joints.
2,Another Classic takes a beating!,"I recently imported this game and WAS planning on buying the English version, if and when it comes out. A word of WARNING: The Japanese and EURO versions have taken out the music 'A whole NEW WORLD' and 'A FRIEND LIKE ME' and Replaced it with new tunes. This may, or may not be the reason it's taking so long to come out. THere are some new stages that are short, but fun. Still once again the video game makers of today have somewhat ruined a classic from the SNES days. It's still better then the horrible Sega version though."
5,loved horse dinnerware,I bought this dinnerware for my daughter who loves horses. She was very pleased. Will be glad to order again.
1,Broken,"Ordered two sets of these, When they arrived most of the items were broken. IDK if it was caused buy the delivery service, the lack of protective packaging or the truck that the box looked like it had been run over by. Out of the two sets was able to make up enough good pieces to make one complete set minus a bowl. Would have sent them both back had it not been for Christmas. Refund was prompt and fast."
4,EXCELLENT GIFT,"The River's Edge Dinnerware Set featuring horses was a gift to family members. They are 'horsey' people and were thrilled to receive it. I'll have to say, I was amazed that it was delivered in excellent condition - no breakage, etc. The sizes of the pieces were way above average. We were pleased to give this set as a special gift."
5,no comment,"I purchased this item on Aug 10 and was informed it's been shipped on Aug 11. Today is Sep 9, I still not get it yet no matter how hard I kept calling Amzaon and sending inquiry to the seller. Is there somebody can help with?"
2,Too Much Kong.,"Well, This is an interesting deal here. Most score soundtracks are music only. However I was taken aback by the fact that this has the spoken dialog all through the Cd which makes it come across more like an audio book than a soundtrack album. Wierd. It's as if whoever mastered this just copied it from the video of the movie. That said, the sound quality is excellent. Interesting but wait for the bargain bin sale."
5,To Be Forewarned Is To Be Forearmed!,"If a special blessing is bestowed upon those who read the Bible Book of Revelation, how much more to those who study God's final Word to mankind. This Expositional Commentary is so full of detailed, eye-opening truth, it is impossible to do it justice by a review...you will have to read it for yourself!!!"
5,Revelation,This was delivered in excellent time and in very good condition. It is a great help in teaching the book of Revelation. I recommend it highly to anyone interested in trying to understand this often thought of as unreadable book in the Bible.
4,Christmas Gift,"This seemed like a good reference book, since the recipient had another book by the same author. Haven't had any feedback about it, but it's probably a well researched book to add to anyone's library."
5,"Well, I did not get sick, nor did he....","After a good friend returned from a tour in Iraq, he told me about a ""sterilizing pen"" that he had used while overseas. I have to admit that I was rather skeptical being a pump carrying/Iodine using type hiker, but I decided to give the thing a try (swayed by the info that other military folks in my friends unit did get sick, and the information on the Steri-Pen website as to the frequency of illness with the methods of purification I was using).Since its purchase I have utilized the Steri-Pen on two multi day hiking trips, and have felt fine the whole time. Admittedly, I did not drink from any questionable sources, nor did anyone else in my party get sick using other methods. But with the weight being so little and the level of removal claimed by the maker being so high, I felt that this was a great purchase for someone into lightweight packing.I will amend this entry if I do get sick in the future......"
3,Good for world travel but not so much for US backcountry,"Pros: Its a nice lightweight alternative to a filter, kills viruses along with everything else, perfect for sterilizing a glass of tapwater in 3rd world countries instead of buying bottled water.Cons: can be tempermental if not operated correctly, batteries are expensive, fragile UV bulb, you have to filter the larger particles out of the water before you can sterilize, limitation on what type of containers you can use.I ended up returning mine because its easier to use a katyadyn filter. I would buy it again, however, if I were traveling to underdeveloped countries."
3,Meh.,"Get the one that uses rechargeable AA batteries if you go anywhere off the beaten path (eg. Third World countries) at all. You can't find the CR123A batteries this one uses outside of major cities there, and sometimes not even then."
1,Not reliable,"I've giving it a single star for being unreliable.I got this thing and tried it out a couple times and it seemed to work. Then I took it on a weeklong backpack trip and it failed from day one because it ran the rechargeable batteries down after less than 5 uses. I should have brought Iodine tabs as a backup.Also, the LED lights used to indicate readiness are very difficult to see in sunlight, and the message system needlessly confusing. A sound-based system would be much better. Finally, the info about lights out to be printed on the case so that losing the instructions doesn't render the unit totally useless."
3,Steripen Adventurer,"SteriPEN Adventurer Handheld Water PurifierThe 1st device I received was faulty. Both the company and Amazon were very responsive to my requests for a replacement. The device appears to be quite fragile, not what I would expect in a device which is to be used for trekking."
3,Works as advertised but is hard on batteries !,"Great idea. Works well and is not hard to use. Be careful of the battery life, especially if you take a long trip. The solar charger works but seems to take a ling time to charge. I use it traveling... even for motel use."
1,batteries,I have had this watch for about six years now. The batteries died just after the 3-year warranty expired. You cannot just get a local jeweler to replace the battery. The battery runs $ 40+ and needs to go back to Seiko to have it done. I had a local jeweler change the battery rather than ship it. The second hand moved in 5 second increments and the perpetual calendar is gone...there is no calendar. The second battery just died again this weekend. Not going to throw any more good money after bad.
5,I like it.,This is really a very good watch. Shiny and elegant. Goes well with both casual and formal clothes. It's definitely a good buy.
2,Watch not working,"I do not know what the problem was, but this watch did not work when I received it. I was very much disappointed. I had no difficulty in returning the product and getting a full refund. Good customer service, but the product just was not working."
5,Great Game,"This game is the real deal. It's a must have for college basketball fans. It's graphics are great and I like that you can do a season, create a team, and much more. You can also play a mascot game or make a school into a national powerhouse. You can also create and edit players, and pick from all 326 teams. This game is great."
4,Great game but slow loading,"This is a great game. This time you can be the coach of your favorite college. Also if you edit the players name, it will show it on the back of their jerseys. Dynasty mode is great but recruiting and other off-season tasks are slow. This time you can export a draft class to NBA Live 2004. The controls are the same as they are on NBA Live. The only thing I didn't like about this game is when you edit a person and get done the game takes you back to edit player and you have to find the team and the next person again. Dynasty mode is the best because you can be the coach for your favorite college. I am in my second year with North Carolina and my team won the national title my first year. Our overall record was 36-2. A fun game if you have nothing else to do. It is a great game but NBA Live 2004 is a little better."
4,Nothings better,this game is simply amazing R2 freestyle mode is incredable. graphics are super and gameplay is awesome. If u like college basketball this game is for u. I give this a A+ grade
4,Pretty good,"Don't get me wrong, this game is good. The crowds are awesome, the graphics are fair, and the gameplay is great, but once again EA puts no effort into its college hoops game. They say you can make a team, but in reality, you cant. Theres about 6 logos, whick suck, and your uniforms aren't even the same colors as your primary colors. The create a team is a joke. If you get this game, you have to play the mascot games. They are hysterical. Besides that, the game has way too many teams, like 320! It takes you forever and then some to find your team. When it comes to gameplay its great. Its just like the college game. The press works, and you actually have to work to make shots. Unlike NBA Live where you just pump fake twice, drive and dunk. The crowds are incredible, they make the game. Dick Vitale can get a little annoying though. Overall not a bad game. If you like college hoops you should get it."
4,this game blows,"This NCAA game blows major apples. The game isnt good because you dont have the alaska tournament shootout or the preseason NIT or the post-season NITtournament. You only have the Maui invitational and the NCAA tounament. Plus your ratings fall each game. I was playing with UCI and i beat maryland, wisconsin,georgia tech and kentucky and i still wasnt ranked. i was 21-0 and i still wasnt ranked. You creators at EA Sports need to fix up this game for a better one next year. You need to put all the Conference tounaments and every other tournament at the right gym. Also you need to make all the gyms the way they are in real life. NCAA March Madness SUCKS. Create a better one next year."
2,Still waiting for a Great College Basketball Title,"Although this year's March Madness is a step up from last year's version (it now includes many more teams, like mid-major Creighton, etc., and it fixed some of the tournament issues), I'm still sorely disappointed by gameplay and features.Gameplay is relatively intuitive, and the ability to juke and set plays are decent, yet the game lacks imagination and creativity in its setup.Problems with the menu are particularly troubling -- you must load your ""favorite team"" each time you play, as well as your saved dynasties and settings. Recruiting is a tiring task, which is disappointing since I truly enjoy this feature in EA's football series.The game is a bit buggy, with the announcers calling out the wrong team's name (I was up by 40+ pts, and had scored 12 straight unanswered points, but Dick Vitale said my opponent was ""on fire"".) :-)I would not recommend a purchase -- either buy it used, rent it, or wait until next year."
4,pretty good game,this a pretty good game because the grapics are pretty good the gameplay is alright and Dick Vitale keeps the commentary livly.It is pretty hard to score because some of the times you get charging foul if you try to do a lay up or a dunk. I will give this four stars because of this reason.
2,Overrated game!! Don't buy this game!,"First of all, if anybody on here claims this game is amazing is automatically an idiot. Second of all, NCAA College Basketball 2k4 makes this game look silly. The first thing I noticed is that this games graphics are subpar and the 3 dimensional aspect of the arenas are terrible. I also noticed a choppiness among the gameplay when a lot seems to be going on. I am not sure how the XBOX version handles this but the PS2 version sucks. The Dynasty mode is the only bonus going for the game but the actual gameplay which is what really counts is terrible and very arcadish and isn't certainly worth any of your hard earned money."
4,"for ""full of chese"" man","um hello to have to stop selecting your fav. team just save your settings. and there must be something wrong with your system, cause i (and my friend he has the ps2 and i have the X-Box version) have never had trouble loading or saving. so in conclusion i have to say that you are FULL OF CHESE!!!!!!! lol jk #:)"
4,wow,this is the best game ever this is a 10000000000 star game. Other reviews rip this game they are the dumbest people in the world. If you buy another game instead you are stupid too.
5,Equal to the Story of the Bounty and it's passengers mutiny,"This is the fabulous story of the Wager, a ship wrecked at Tierra Del Fuego after failing to survive the rough trip around Cape Horn. Barely had the survivors scrambled ashore before trouble began. Fueled by a large number of soldiers on board, the large amount of alcohol (this was the store ship in a large fleet trying to circumnavigate the world), there were troubles and factions galore.This is just a great read. Byron in the title refers to the Poet Byron's grandfather, so obviously they survived!"
1,Agree. Con. Way too expensive,Please go to any store nearby and be surprised to find this product for a third of the price offered. You will have to pay as much as buying two of these packs at a local store if you want to return them. :) . so good luck
3,handy,these are good but for someone like me that will use these in not even 2 hours for a really bad day. other times just a couple of minutes. that is how much i sneeze if you sneeze a lot you will waste a lot of money with having to keep buying more and more.
1,Pathetic Price,Are you kidding me. $7.19 for 8 pocket tissue? I ordered it by mistake. I wanted to return it but it didn't come with a free return.
5,take them everywhere!,"I always have some in my glove box, purse, backpack and anytime I leave the house. You never know when you'll need to wipe up a spill or blow your nose and have nothing handy to do it with. Kleenex brand is always so soft, even to the most irritated nose."
4,A pretty satisfying sequel,"As good a game as the original Mega Man Zero was, this sequel improves upon it in every way. The most welcome change is that Zero is now given ""lives"" to complete a level compared to only one try per area in the original. This is good, because Capcom didn't let up on the difficulty. This game is HARD, and although it didn't keep me from playing and enjoying it, it probably wouldn't be appropriate for younger players. Personally, I thought the old Mega Man/Mega Man X games were too easy and like the added challenge. The Cyber Elves, which help Zero out in various ways, are there in case things get too difficult.Zero's new weapon, a chain rod which Zero can use to reel in items and enemies and swing from obstacles, adds a fun new element, but using it successfully can be frustrating.Fun for old-school Mega Man fans and action lovers, but make sure you can take the heat."
4,great challenging game,"The zero series is a fantastic megaman spinoff. And zero 2 was my introduction to the series. Its a tough game but I like the fact that it sort of adapts to the players level of skill without a difficulty option, the better you do the more challenging the bosses become. Its got some awesome soundtracks and the visuals are beautiful for a gba title. The gameplay is fun though it'll take a little time to get used to the chain rod but zero moves pretty smoothly otherwise. Id reccomend it to anyone"
4,Very Cool,"This 2nd game is very cool, yet difficult. In the beginning, you MUST train your weapons to get stronger, and if you pass the game, you must once again train your weapons. But overall, the game is very cool."
4,MMZ2 is great can't wait till MMZ3 comes out,The game is more difficult than the 1st but it give a lot more info on whats been happening in the world of mega man and I know there has to be a part three since at the end someone was talking about Omega X retruning and it seems that the Dark Elf and Zero know each other so more info will come when MMZ3 comes out hopefully
2,Mega Man Zero 2,Cool music and okay graphics do not hide the fact that gameplay is poor and there are multiple bosses per stage. The controls are also poor and the gameplay itself is repetitive and frustrating. I would not expect the average audience (Or me) to ever get past the first level.
4,SO..............FRUSTERATING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ok, this game has nice graphics, and cool music,but if you dont like hard games, you might not want to buy.The concept is good,the gameplay is good,and control is normal.Ya youll be slashing, or shooting,and think its the best game,like I did,once you get to the scorpion boss thing,ohhh boy,Yuo go through so much and hurt your thumb,youll stop for awhile.The game is ok, but not great."
5,I read these books back in the 80's,I read several of these books back in the early 80's and I found the ones like this one that I never read so I'm catching up on how it all started. Always enjoyed the books
3,Super Reader,"A cop that has gone a little off the rails ends up killing a perp. He gets severely shafted and executed for it. Only not quite, this is used as a cover to train a secret agent, basically, in all sorts of things, including superhuman karate, and point him at the 'bad guys'.The first of whom are a well established bunch of mafioso.Hero as vigilante who kills with his bare hands, in other words."
4,destroyer,cool read would like to read more in the series. was hoping to see more of chuin but will have to wait tilli read more books
4,It was awesome,"I bought it because I was a fan of the movie, but the book is even better. I look forward to reading the whole series!"
3,Its a beginning,"Created the Destroyer is a good read. It lacks the charactor that the later books bring, but it still has all the elements. I think you'd have to read the Destroyer 1 just to see the roots."
4,The Destroyer #1,I liked this book because it was fast-paced and on the edge of extreme. I liked the analog 70's setting. It's good vs. evil where even the good seem evil. I look forward to more of this series.
4,Created The Destroyer,Very unrealistic but a fun read. I hung into the story to the very end. This was my introduction to the Remo series.
3,Not worth the hefty price,It was a good read but the price vs the meat didn't seem worth it. I read Asimovs Foundation series for less and enjoyed it just as much. You can finish this book in less than a few hours and for $15 it didn't seem worth the investment.
4,Ahhh. A new series!,"Loved the Remo Williams movie, and was looking for a new series to sink my teeth into. The book is well written, with just enough background info to make you want more. I will definitely be reading more."
4,"Created, the destroyer",I had seen the movie years ago and was looking forward to another movie that never came. The book series will have to suffice.
5,funny,"read this one about 30 years ago for the first time,its still entertaining and fun to read. will read all the other ones too"
3,Left hanging...,"While I did enjoy the book, I felt like I was left hanging and confused. The whole second half of book was built around an assassin going after someone who turns out not to be real, a woman that he got involved with but nothing to let me know what happened with her, and a character from earlier in book shows up again only to have it implied that he was to be killed. The book just kinda stopped telling the story in a way that had me asking a lot of ""what about..."""
3,Not for me,To much like graphic novel. Not enough development and too superficial. I would not recommend this to anyone over fifteen
4,Fun read,"First read these when they were originally published. Nostalgic. The later books were more enjoyable as the relationship between Remo and Chiun developed. Also, the authors used more humor as the series developed."
3,created the destroyer,It was a little hard to keep the characters straight in the beginning. It was a little darker than I expected but once I got into the plot it was a fun read.
2,"Created, The Destroyer","Thought the book was slow. Everything seemed so predictable. Plot never did develop. ShoulDers, Would not very believable. Would not recommend."
2,Bad formating,I got this book for free but formating is get on my nerve. There is no text justify and it's pain for eyes.Well it's free but I'll don't buy over book's in series from Gere Donovan Press (1.0 edition). May be later then they correct this error.
5,Draws you right in,"Unwinds page after page with plenty of surprises to keep you fascinated right to the last page. No dull spots. A bit fantastical, but good escape literature to keep you entertained."
3,Not a bad read,Pretty good reading but slow on a plot. Demo has a knack of following his ideals in funny ways and should stay on the same plot through the entire story. I'll see what #2 brings.
3,"Actually, start with #3 in the series first.","This novel was Sapir and Murphy's first stab at fiction, and it shows in the roughness of the character development. However, they had a wealth of good ideas to mine, and the writing skills were definitely in evidence. This, and #2, are the ones you should read after about ten others, if you have the time and patience to collect and read them serially.Overall, essential for a collector and a decent read, but the series doesn't really get rolling until #3."
3,Good but a little short.,"This is a good novella for anyone who likes action books and was a fan of the movie Remo Williams, The Adventure Begins. This is one case where the movie outshined the source material. I know this is the first book of a large series, but I expected more. You don't really learn too much about the Shinanju training or about Chiun. I did like the plot of him going after the mob as opposed to the government contracter in the movie. The interraction between Remo and Chiun was better in the movie. The biggest off put is the price. $13 and change plus shipping is a lot to pay for a book that does not break 200 pages. Hey E-reads, bundle 3 together for that price or drop the price to 5 or 6 dollars. That would make the purchase worth it. Anyways, I have the next two in the series and hope they get better. I still reccomend this book, but get it used or when they drop the price."
3,A little disappointed,Expected more information on actually working and setting up a church library. Very small book for more money - so expected more.
3,"Jazzy, but not what I expect from Saint Germain","I have come to expect Saint Germain to be a nice blend of Jazz, soul, and techno. This CD is heavy on the jazz, but that's about it. If I want jazz I know how to spell Coltrane."
1,Garbage,"No good, protection light came on in a week.Have to pay to return.Cost more to return.Don't buy,Waste of money.Time it take's to fix and money might as well purchase new."
1,ready for a freak show?,"As a geography teacher I have shown many Globe Trekker videos to my 7th grade classes. The videos on other regions have been well produced and provided a decent balance into the peoples of the world.Globe Trekker really sold out on their depiction of India. This series is divided into regions and while some of the content is accurate too much of it is focused on the weird and exotic India that does not accurately show the true India. Unless of course 1.2 billion people are solely rat worshipers and drug addicts. So, disappointed was I in this series that I threw the DVD in the trash and no proceed with caution before buying a Global Trekker video.For a better buy see Discovery Atlas India."
3,A slog in the jungle,"Like most reviewers agree, this is an excellent story in the first person. Herr's dense writing is like the slog of the grunts through the jungle. Not always easy to digest, it is a story for the ages. If you want to really feel the truth about war, here it is."
3,"stylish work, but too anonymous for a huge fan","Didn't work for me. Sad since the sentimental (mis)education/odyssey of a young canadian jew could have worked wonders for an old fan of THE voice like me.Why ?Because the flow of consciouness style of the novel isn't my favorite (some quotes were brilliant - hell, its HIM - but in general I found it too heavy).Also because how autobiographical the book is isn't answered and since he's always been mysterious about the origin of his work in songs or his life, I guess I was - foolishly - looking for answers, that unfortunately cannot be found in here and IT IS a big deal for an avid fan like me.If only his memoires could be published someday to answer some of the questions I had. But I'm afraid he'll eternally be too busy seducing us with his shy charm and poetry for that. And maybe it'll be for the best, as usual."
5,One of the better spinoffs...,"This is one of the better spinoff albums of all time. What I like about this album is Griff does not try to do to much, as he is more of a poet than a rapper, which shows on ""Real African People Parts 1 and 2"" and ""The Interview"" and of course the title track is banging!"
1,The drawer lock doesn't work,They sat on this order for a week before sending it out. Then when it finally arrived it was broken from the start. The key does not lock the drawers or unlock them. It has no effect on the drawers at all.
4,gerat new italian music,"This is the music the young italian listen no mandolins here but great fresh songs! my favorites are un giorno migliore, qualcosa di grande and se ci sarai A must have!!!"
3,A surprise ending,"I have listened to this CD several times and read all the reviews (to date). I have to admit I was kind-of shocked at some of the choices that Sir George Martin picked for a farewell-tribute-to-the-Beatles CD. I think that Sir George took some risks with this CD. Some payed off and some didn't. But the one track that grabbed me the most, and from reading the other reviews here certainly seems the most disliked, is the title track ""In My Life"". It is an equisite gem. The reading by Sean Connery is so poetic that it completely redefined the song for me. Martin's orchestration is perfect for the song and I get goose bumps every time I hear it. To me, that song is the perfect ending to a long and illustrious career."
5,Wonderful Collection Of Beatle Tributes,I enjoyed both the performances and the quality of the recordings. The selection of songs was excellent and the artist selection was unique.
3,"Sing more, Jim!!!","I don't wait much from such albums. So why did I buy it? Because I noticed that Phil Collins and Jim Carrey exist over there. To be honest, Collins didn't excite me a lot but Jim... I simply wanted to hear how does he sing...It is 4:30PM now when I am writing this review from my office and there is 3 long long hours until I come home and share my emotions with my wife and friends. I listened Jim's performance about 10 times by now and even during the first listening I've even had a vision of 'Jim ""performing"" this song live in his great manner'! I appreciate Jim's role in the movie business but what would it be a band if Jim carried the lead vocal in it!!!The album is poor (I wouldn't rate it with even two stars), but Jim's performance is Fan-tas-tic!!! Go on, Jim! 5 stars are Yours, but there was too little of You here... ;-)P.S. Come Together by Robin Williams & Bobby McFerrin is also brilliant!"
1,"Seinfeld said it best: ""...who are these people!?!?""","Why in the world would Sir George Martin make THIS his fond farewell?? Jim Carey? Goldie Hawn, Robin Williams.... why??? Save your money and buy the real deal 'cuz this set of BEATle tunes have really been BEAT this time around... sorry George... ya know, I really wanted to like it to!"
1,What a disappointment.,I couldn't wait for this CD to arrive. It was just like receiving a large gift wrapped box with nothing in it.
5,Incredible!!!,"This CD is phenomenal. Such a great different look at some classic songs. The best by far, however, is Sean Connery's rendition of ""In My Life."" While I've always loved that song, and it's never the same as the original, I nearly cried the first time I heard it, and every time since."
4,The Video Tells The Story,One has to watch the video to get a true appreciation of what Sir George was trying to accomplish and the performances that he attempted to elicit from his eclectic band of performers.
3,Is John Happy About This?,"A question that music scholars will debate is would the Beatles have been as successful as they were without George Martin? Would George Martin have achieved the fame he did without the Beatles? Food for thought. This project is first and foremost a George Martin production with NO input from the surviving Beatles. I am truly curious why they were not included for a few tracks. This is a first rate professional work, very nicely arranged and recorded. It is an eclectic mix of artists doing for the most part tasteful arty arrangements of classic Beatle tunes. DON'T expect this to sound anything like the Beatles, do expect some interesting and at times odd renditions."
1,Even the BLUE MEANIES couldn't stomach this one...,"William Shatner meet Connery, Sean Connery.........Robin Williams & Bobby McFerrin (don't bother Coming, especially Together, you egomanics), Goldie Hawn (Torch Song Shrill-ogy), Celine Dion (Running your hands through what hair, the man's bald), Jim Carrey (oh untimely dretch!), Billy Connelly (send out the clown), Sean Connery (You Only Sing Once...thankfully)Phil Collins is passable on skins, and Jeff Beck guitar gently weeping are OK.On the good side, this CD is 10 times better than ""Trout Mask Replica by Captain Beefheart. So we have that going for us."
1,A Future Rhino Records Novelty Release,"Years from now, we will laugh at this. I'm gettting an early start. Sean Connery's rendention of ""In My Life"" ranks right up there with William Shatner's ""reading"" of Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds. The rest of the CD ranges from the boring to the frankly bizarre.It's sadly poignant that a man who, in many ways, was the epitome of excellent pop musical taste, fell over the ledge at the end. And in the end, George ... the kitsch you take isn't equal to the music you helped make. A goofy and embarrassing farewell."
3,In my life by Sean Connery,"That was the only reason I purchased the CD - was to get the ""song"" In my life by Sean."
3,"a few nuggets, a few more bombs","This album is worth buying for a few tracks, namely Jeff Beck's incredible interpretation of A Day in the Life, Jim Carrey's surprisingly good and hilarious version of I am the Walrus (he could front a rock band, no sweat, on personality alone), Robin Williams and Bobby McFerrin's Come Together (if George can make Robin sound decent singing, he can make anyone sound good!), and Vanessa Mae's beautiful take on Because. Goldie Hawn cracks us up w/ her lounge version of Hard Day's Night, as well. However, the rest is either mediocre or mostly fodder (Celine Dion, Phil Collins, Sean Connery--doing spoken word for In My Life! Ouch!). Buy it cheap if you can. Showcases George's amazing production talents, using a plethora of seasoned backup musicians to recreate the Beatles moods relatively well."
3,Definitely a mixed bag,"The best songs on this cd are ""Here, There"" by Celine Dion, ""Because"" on violin, ""Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight,"" John Williams' ""Here Comes the Sun"" on classical guitar & even Jim Carrey's loopy ""I am the Walrus."" The very worst? Goldie Hawn whispering her boring way thru ""Hard Day's Night"" & Billy Connolly screaming ""For the Benefit of Mr. Kite."" Very Golden Throatish! At least the orchestrations are very good for all selections. This is a curiosity piece, get it only if you're a huge Beatles fan."
3,"some gems, some laughs, some bombs","George Martin's production skills are more than evident on this final effort, though his judgement in choosing participants is questionable. Jim Carrey's version of Walrus is absolutely hilarious and does justice to the song (I think based on this effort alone, he could front his own rock group--he's got the character, no doubt). Jeff Beck's version of A Day in the Life is fantastic, Vanessa Mae's Because is beautiful, and even Robin Williams' collaboration with Bobby McFerrin on Come Together is palatable. But there are too many throwaways, including Celine Dion (ugh), Phil Collins, and a laughable spoken-word of In My Life by Sean Connery. In short, get it cheap and it's worth the few nuggets."
3,In my life,"Deliverance was fast and ok. The item (CD) is sealed as promissed, BUT the seal-material doesn't fit excactly to the CD-cover. I don't know if it has been opened and what condition the CD and inlay has, because it is a gift for a friend (he hasn't got it yet.)."
2,Overpriced and came broken!,"well.. for 140 dollars plus 20 dollars shipping fees I expected a good product and at least decent packing! Instead product arrived with several scratches, cracks and 2 broken parts! I contacted the seller and showed them some photos but customer service refused to exchange or refund saying it's between me and the carrier!Although Item is very fragile, it was packed loose and carelessly in a light box without even putting a fragile label on the package!Regarding the item itself it surely looks beautiful but very fragile and craftsmanship is totally not worth the price! I regret buying from Oriental Furniture and will never consider their cheap products or poor customer service again."

2,I expected more,"While the book itself is of course in perfect shape, I had thought it would be more comprehensive and would also carry complete documents. Instead it is a selection of fragments. Obviously I misunderstood what it was about. The author does state in the foreword that it is intended for readers not specialised in the area, but I was looking for something more like a ""white book""...To sum up, while I can say nothing ""against"" the book, which might well be worth a reading for beginners, I would not recommend it to those in search of much specific detail."
3,Eh,"Had to read this for a Graduate Women's Studies class. Felt that the author could have used more diversity in the women writers she chose to focus on, perhaps some fiction as well, and more informed bios of the writers."
4,Outstanding Book,"This book might better be called ""Shilling on Deflation"" -it rivals the mega best-seller ""Bogle on Mutual Funds."" You might buy it just for the incredible historical charts and facts which are unavailable elsewhere.One thing it lacks, however, is a concise argument why we would encounter mild deflation without being on the gold standard - which historically has caused mild deflation for decades in the 1800's and early 20th century. I do not see how the U.S. consumer is going to suddenly turn into a japanese-like saving machine, on Alan Greenspan's watch, unless Greenspan screws up very badly.Nevertheless, this is the guy who published in 1983, ""Is inflation ending? Are you ready?"" - ignore him at your own peril! His investment and saving strategies also justify the purchase price of the book."
3,Deflation never happened.,Deflation never happened. Maybe it was all the money the Fed pumped into the economy for problems that never happened like the Y2K or Millennium bug. Then we got the housing and real estate bubbleflation followed by a panic and more money pumping. With so much officious meddling how can you forecast anything? I guess we'll just have to keep on flying by the seat of the pants.
2,Watch for Manufacture defects,"I have ordered and received two faucets from Mico and both had chrome defects. Just make sure to check your product when you get it, because Mico does not check before then send it."
5,the joyful surprise of discovery,"If you read, as I do, in order to discover new universes and how people behave within them, then you will revel in this book."
2,A Mills & Boon's story set on a Tea-Estate,"All you people who gave this book 4 stars and more...and likened it to ""The God of Small Things""......obviously haven't read much quality literature.I found this book quite readable.I didn't hate it..but I certainly wouldn't put in in the same category as 'The God of Small Things"". It started off quite well, but dwindled into nothing more than soap-opera set in the tropics.Unlike 'The God of Small Things""...or even ""Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard""...the characters in this story had no depth...and were quite wooden.Nothing but a mere romance novel...set in an usual setting."
5,Perfect Size Box for Your Car,The Kleenex Juniors are hard to find in local stores. Ford vehicles have a space designed to hold a tissue box and the only one that fits is the Kleenex Juniors. I was happy to finally find a source for this size box.
2,overpriced,I was glad to find these tissues in a box the right size for my car. I expected a multipack of tissue for this price. As described it is ONE box of 65 tissues. This makes each tiny tissue over 10 cents each! Next time I'll read more carefully.
4,Very good,This book has a lot of very good information on trailing. Definitely would recommend it to all hunters. The are so many real life tracking stories that it gets repetitive after a while. After reading this you will certainly try harder not to wound a deer and will not give up the trail.
5,"staying centered, living as an authentic person, being part of your community","I wrote it so of course I think it's great; but in reality it is not so much a ""self-help"" book but a trail guide for how we might learn to be who we really are and learn to live with human dignity in community"
2,DISSAPOINTMENT,"This game was a big disapointment. It was almost exactly the same as medal of honor frontline. The only difference was the levels, which were even more boring then frontline's levels. The storyline is so stupid that I skiped the in game movies. If EA wants to make a good and different war game than I suggest they make a war game about either the revolutionary war or the civil war. Theres too many games about world war 2 or about ""special forces"" games. These games have died out years ago, and there still making them!"
