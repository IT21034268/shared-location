5,Book shares a personal approach,"Now I Sea is a wonderful journey through some very interesting experiences of the author. She provides extensive insight into her growth as a Christian with a personal relationship with God. This is a great book for anyone wishing to stregthen and deepen their own spiritual relationship.While I enjoyed the author's light-hearted chapters and career/life advice, I found the chapter on her experiences on the beaches of Normandy to be the most compelling. In this time of terrorism and war, the caring images of Christ that she describes are particularly comforting; I think this chapter speaks both to those who have lost someone through war or violence, as well as to those who have lost someone through more ordinary means.Whether you love the sea, or, like me, prefer the mountains, this book is a refreshingly personal approach to faith in life."
4,Great at-home workout,"This DVD is a great 40 minute band workout for someone who practices intermediate to advanced pilates. Moira is very clear on what to do and what muscles you should be working and feeling it in. It is a great tool to have when I am away from home and my gym. The only thing I would do differently, it make it a little longer!"
2,This workout is not 42 minutes - it's 23 minutes,"The one reviewer that said this is a great 42 minute workout obviously never watched it! It's only 23 minutes. I would never have bought it if that's all it was. I did find it challenging, tho."
3,Nothing new,A little disappointed in this workout. It really isn't intense unless you are new to exercise. Should have done a little more research on the product.
4,The last five days of a dictator's life.,"After reading this book, I realized how a cornered rat feels when he knows there in no way out.The book details the end of World War II in Italy and the lastdays in the life of Benito Mussolini. At first it reports howMussolini was surrounded by hundreds of faithful, including German soldiers detailed to protect him. He runs here, then there in hopes of retaining a little more power. In the end heis caught by the Communist partisans who execute him, rather thanhave him talk to the Allied governments.At least Mussolini faced his situation in the end with bravery.The book provides a negative view of the the Communist partisanwho executed him and other Italian fascists, and the people of Milan who displayed his corpse and others."
2,An anticlimax,The pen of Robin Cook has always kept me riveted until the very end of each and every novel except this one. The expectation of the medical action beginning from the start of the novel was sadly lacking in this one. There was too much preamble and emotional jargon that took away from the essence. Also the title does accurately describe what the story was reaaly about which was HTSR. The ending was an extreme disappointment. A true end was not clearly stated and I felt as though there wasn't completion. I love the artistry of Robin Cook and I hope that his future novels will not go down this same road.
1,SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT!!,"I was so disappointed in this novel!! Like so many other readers: I, too was waiting for Cook's latest to appear. Now I am so sorry that I wasted my time and money. I should have consulted the other reader's comments and I would never have bought this book."
2,unbelievable plot,I have been a fan of Robin Cook and waiting since last Oct for this book to come out. The plot is not believable. Cook mixes a mob link plus the Shroud of Turin to yield a plot that just never gets off the ground. We wait through the entire book for the results of the operation which should be the focus of the book. The operation occurs and the book ends almost immediately. It just does not work.
1,Life is too short to waste on bad books,"I have read most of Cook's books, and this is the worst. After I read over 100 uninteresting pages, I checked the reviews here and found many similar negative opinions; so I quit reading it. I think it's time to dust off your stethoscope Robin.Thanks for the online reviews folks, Amazon.com"
1,3 stooges,"This book is extraordinarily bad. The main characters bicker endlessly, when they are not rolling their eyes at each other. It is apparent early on that Dr. Cook needs plot filler so he goes off in any feasible direction to fill his word quota. Eventually it is entertaining because it is so funny. Basically the plot proceeds due to the ineptitude of all characters, especially the main ones, and while I am supposed to be reading a ""serious medical thriller"" I am laughing at the antics of characters who cannot do anything right. All ends appropriately just out of the three stooges. Somehow the seriously little lecture at the end (""faction"") tops things off perfectly."
3,Hard to describe,"How do you describe a book about therapeutic cell therapy that also includes the Mafia, the Vatican, the Shroud of Turin, U.S. political shenanigans, off-shore medical facilities and a boatload of other disparate elements. One thing that always surprises me about Cook's books is that well-educated people act in the most stupid and lawbreaking manners. This book is one of the most convoluted of Cook's efforts and I often found myself thinking it was just stupid. Still, the plot did not stop long enough to make it completely unbearable. Still, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. There are simply too many better books available to waste time on this one."
3,Not his best work,It is completely unrealistic to use an off-shore clinic for secrecy and then tell them that the DNA being used came from the Shroud of Turin. When no one asked. How long would that secret be kept? From that point on it was obvious it would fall apart.
4,Not Too Bad,"I read all of Robin Cook's novels. I really like them. He has a talent for suspense and almost believable procedures, cures etc. I found this novel to be ok. I've enjoyed some of his others better. They were more suspenseful than this one. But this one seems more based in reality and therefore was a little more technical and I think truer to life. And I don't know about you all, but my life is not suspenseful so I forgive this novel for not being such. But it does deal with some real issues.I could relate to the research and the benefits and the risks. All of it I could identify with. To me, the ending was the best. How strange it was to be laughing in a room alone and gasping too. The end for me was worth it.A-"
3,another cook winner,"An atypical plot akin to Da Vinci code winds through this relatively simple storyline that while it may not keep you guessing, is certainly interesting to follow. A refreshing take on the stem cell controversy."
1,Judge for Yourself,"Seizure, by Robin Cook.Judge this book for yourself. Here are a few of his descriptive phrases.""Eyes like two bullet holes in a dirty, white blanket,"" ""liquid-onyx eyes,"" ""black metallic eyes"" and, best of all, ""blue orbs.""""Mink-like hair,"" ""raven-haired lady,""""hair frazzled like a clump of steel wool.""""The saw-toothed spires of the Manhattan skyline"" and the ""prosaic window air conditioners blemished its facade.""""A contented belch rumbled from the pit of Daniel's stomach to emerge between his puffed-up cheeks.""""Their circadian cycles were awry."" (Jet lag to you and me.)""Officious haberdashers had always put him off with their condescending manner as if they were paragons of good taste."" (Does this put you off?)"
3,Seized by Seizure!,"Robin Cook has done it again. He kept me up way too late and had me wondering about the correct pronunciation, if not meaning, of medical terms. There was even a timely medical ethics theme. I'm not sure he did what he set out to do however. The further I read the more convinced I was that he intended it to be a black comedy. But after finishing the novel and reading his notes, it seems he was deadly serious. In any event I loved it and can't wait for someone to put it on the screen. I even have a fantasy cast in mind, including Leslie Neilson and perhaps John Travolta. If you liked Pulp Fiction you'll love Seizure. Read it now, then wait for the movie. I'm sure it will come soon!"
1,Seizure was DOA!!,"As a real fan of Dr. Cook's novels I was delighted to see ""Seizure"" released. However, from the very beginning this book was a real letdown.The two lead characters were total losers, the male, Dr. Daniel Lowell was a self described ""egotistical jerk"" and his main squeeze, a 20 year younger ""raven-haired beauty"" wasn't much more sympathetic. As a reader, if I can't sympathize and identify w/the main characters, or even like them, why do I care about what happens to them? And in this book, I didn't. Made for some pretty dull reading as you can imagine.I struggled thru the entire book, hoping all the way that it would get better, but it doesn't. Won't spoil the ending for you, but it wasn't worth the read.If you want to check out Dr. Cook, try some of his older novels like Coma or Sphinx. At least in those you can stomach the main participants."
2,Robin Cook Casserole,"Remember when Robin Cook wrote tense medical thrillers? Books that combined medicine with interesting characters that you actually cared about as a reader, and could almost identify with?That's not this book.Instead, take the mobsters from ""Blindsight"", the megalomania of ""Godplayer"", the Wingate Clinic from ""Shock"", the human cerebral experimentation of ""Brain"", the FDA procedural flouting of ""Acceptable Risk"", and a tiny pinch of the archaeology of ""Sphinx"", and you'll have ""Seizure"", a story that seems like a hodgepodge of Cook's other novels thrown into a blender and half-baked to a distinctly unsatisfactory conclusion."
2,What has happened to Robin Cook?,"Although this book is a slight improvement over Cook's dismal previous book (""Shock""), that's not saying much. ""Seizure"" starts promisingly, but quickly deteriorates into a series of contrived, dreary chase scenes. Cook also embarrasses himself by including the Shroud of Turin as a plot element; this serves no apparent purpose beyond padding the novel with a lengthy detour to Italy. The story ends abruptly, with all the loose ends tied up in an amateurish final chapter. Perhaps Cook's fame has made him immune to editorial interference; if he had written like this early in his career, we would never have heard of him. For well-written medical fiction, try Michael Palmer instead."
2,Not one sympathetic character!,"I listened to the audio version of this book. It was read well enough, but to stay engaged with a story, I need at least one character to care about. It doesn't have to be Mr/Ms Pure-and-Perfect, but I have to respect or sympathize with that person in some way. This book had no such characters, and the sudden ending that other reviewers complained about was, for me, the only acceptable way to get away from all those horrid people! With one other exception, I have really enjoyed Cook's work. I hope he was just having an off-novel."
3,OK Read....But Far from Cook's Best,"I have read almost all of Robin Cook's medical thrillers and have enjoyed all of them. They are typically easy to read, have interesting plots, and good character development. However, I found Seizure to be a big disappointment. The plot was almost ""too convuluted"" to even be plausible. Also, I read Cook's books for the story, suspense, and science...NOT painful detail. The amount of detail in this novel is excruciating. WOW. At some points, I felt like I was reading a textbook. Also, I found the end atrocious. It was too unbelievable and contrived--too easy. You'll see what I mean when you read it. If you've never read one of Cook's books, I suggest starting with another."
1,Skip this one - did Robin Cook even write it?,"Hiss-boo! This one is the worst Cook ever.There are NO likeable characters = no one to care about, they all stink. Everyone is just plain stupid too - they make one mistake after another, few of them plausable.The whole shroud of Turin plot angle is just plain BOGUS! I guess the author wanted to write off a trip to Europe/Turin as ""research"" since this adds nothing to the book.There are lots of problems with this book, please skip it and find something better to read."
1,No stars,"This book was so boring; I could not make myself read it. It was on my desk for 6 weeks, I would read a sentence and leave it there. Finally, I just skimmed trough pages.No plot, no characters, no action, to excitement, no suspense, medically incorrect, technically unbelievable - total waste."
2,Not at all impressed.,"This was my very first Robin Cook novel. After hearing about how great his books were for years, I decided to finally give him a try. Perhaps this was not the book to start with because I thought it was very weak.The book is around 400 pages long, but nothing really happens of any substance until like the last 30 pages and even then it's not too exciting. Lots of filler material between the beginning and end. Let's not get started on the cliched mob angle. Cook used every Italian mob cliche known to man to the point that I laughed at it.The storyline had potential. It dealt with controversial research methods and religion, but it was executed in a very weak fashion. Thumbs down."
2,Started out good but ended abruptly,I enjoyed most of this book and it was much like other Cook novels but was very dissapointed by the ending. It just stops.
1,WHERE IS THE SEQUEL,"I used to read a Robin Cook book in one sitting, this one took forever. Too technical, too much of his own agenda, and an ending that was unbelievably quick. No loose ends tied up.This book has got to have a sequel, but I wish if a book is going to be a two parter, that I be warned in advance."
3,another good thriller,"Wow, after reading some of the other reviews i feel like i must have been reading a different story. i liked this book. it was typical robin cook. all his books have ""issues"" to be explored and this one is no exception. i think he brings an awareness to his novels that others do not. it was a fast paced story. it was not his best effort but he definitely had you thinking by the end of the book and i think that is his intention. the characters are well developed and you can feel a range of emotions toward them. i would recommend this book to anyone. keep writing robin."
1,No Longer Up To Par,"I have always enjoyed Robin Cook's medical thrillers in the past. Now Robin seems to have become too political in his writings, and he forgot to add the thrill. If I want to read someone's political stand, I will just look at my newspaper. Since I do not agree with his stand, I will no longer read his books."
2,Disappointing,"I think all the ingredients for a great book were here, but somehow they just didn't come together. The idea of therapeutic cloning, egotistical doctors and politicians, and the Shroud of Turin never really took off. And by the way, the dust cover tells the whole story. You're almost done with the book before you ever see the word seizure. I'm still a fan, but I'm glad I got it at the library instead of paying full price."
2,Waste of time,"I knew I was in trouble when Spencer Wingate and other characters from Cook's previous book ""Shock"" showed up in this story. I used to really like Cook's work (Coma, Vector, Toxin), but I don't know what has happened in recent years. This book is about 400 pages of preamble and then what one would think is a pretty important part of the story, when Butler actually gets the implant, is glossed over in about twenty pages. What was the point? The ending was ridiculous, although not entirely unexpected. The whole mafia angle added no value to the plot whatsoever. And the dialogue....I don't know where this man lives, but people just don't talk like this! Not even super intelligent people! This is the same issue I had with Shock and he is at it again. I don't recall his previous novels reading this way. To me it is the single most annoying thing about the whole book and one more like this one and I am done with Cook for good."
2,Just pure awful.,"Robin Cook usually includes a lot of medical, technical information but this was way over the top and that alone made me almost nod off.The senator was a greedy, immoral, manipulative jerk who demonstrated the truly horrid part of political power. The male lead was completely unlikable. He was totally self-centered, had no capacity for love and was every bit as greedy and power hungry as the senator. Did I mention those were his good traits? His lover/partner who was supposed to be so brilliant put up with him treating her like garbage. And what was with the whole Mafia thing?Fortunately for me I'd gotten about 1/3 of the way through the book and seeing only boredom ahead for me decided to ""skim-read"" the rest of it because I would have been very upset if I'd wasted all that time on it. Oh, and the ending was completely unsatisfying and just plain stupid. Save your money on this one!Why, oh why didn't I read the reviews on this before I bought it?"
1,It almost gave me one,"Robin Cook's thrillers used to pace the genre, worthy of praise like ""heart-pounding"" and ""pulse-racing""...but this book was so wooden, it was dead on arrival. I don't know why the dialogue was so poorly written (the characters never used contractions, and frequently made ridiculous exclamations, like 'my heavens!'), the plot incredibly slow to take shape and the twists telegraphed chapters in advance. Finally, the rapid climax is so unexpected, it feels like half the book is missing and Cook had to get the title to his publisher.Frankly, this was a parody of a good Robin Cook work...the ethics he promises to examine are explored mostly in the afterword. If you want to read this book, just take two minutes and look at the flap jacket--that's the entire story, right there. Just terrible."
1,A big disappointment,"I'm a reader who likes to whiz through a good book and not have to think much about what I'm reading. I used to be able to do that with Robin Cook novels, and I LOVED them. I am in the medical field and absolutely adored Dr. Cook's early works. His recent novels, though, seem to be harder to follow, and not as focused on the actual medical thriller genre that I love so much. I yearn for something like Coma, Harmful Intent, Outbreak, etc. Earlier Cook works would have me up til the wee hours, sometimes finishing his book in a matter of 1-2 days. I couldn't even get past the first 3 chapters of this one. Big disappointment."
1,BORING!!,"This book is boring!! Don't bother...Also WAY too preachy about medical ethics and Dr. Cook's personal beliefs. I kept reading and hoping but the book never delivers. Too many attempts at an interesting story; the congressman, the researchers, the Italian family -that just don't hold together. Read Cook's MUCH MUCH earlier works (e.g. COMA) if you want a good medical thriller. Or try Michael Palmer's work!"
3,Another formula plot from the previously brilliant Dr. Cook,"Please, Robin Cook, in your apparent effort to raise awareness about stem cell research (with which I happen to agree), you have potentially misrepresented temporal lobe epilepsy as some kind of grotesque, aggressive, Frankensteinian disease which it is NOT. TLE is almost never violent, and is highly treatable with common anticonvulsants. I think you may have done more to scare people from epilepsy than to tweak their interests about stem cells.I used to be glued to your earlier books, but the predictablity has increased and your newer books are almost tedious. Please, also, stop being so condescending about explaining every little nuance of technology.Susan Daly Schneider, MD, MLS"
2,I could not finish this book,"Having picked up this book and started with great expectations after his recent book Shock, I made a big fool of myself by believing that something exciting will throw up soon. But even after crossing 300 pages I could not make out what was going on and ran out of patience. This book reads more like an account of some tourists than a medical thriller. No more Robin Cook books please."
3,Seizure,Good book...a bit slow going but interesting concept in stem cell therapy. I like that Cook really makes you think while you are reading.
4,"Tricky to put up, but looks great!",I got this border to match the Sea Life set I purchased for our baby's room. My husband and mom put it up and needed wall paper paste to get it to stick...was not really pre-pasted...don't even bother trying to put it up without using additional paste. Baby turns one year old tomorrow and it still looks great!
4,Adorable border,"My husband and I hung the border together, which I would definitely recommend. It took quite some time for the border to stick to the wall. We had to keep rubbing the border for about 20 minutes for each strip. We would have it given a 5 if it didn't take so much work to adhere the scallops on the edges. Otherwise, it is a very cute border that really brightens the room!"
1,Glue doesn't hold....,"We fell in love with the sea life theme and purchased several items. The wall border has very poor quality glue. We've never had a problem hanging border before, but the glue on this product is terrible. Yes, we read and followed the directions very carefully! If you purchase this border, use wallpaper glue instead of wetting the border."
5,Found out size,I just absolutely love the whole line of this product. We are not finding out the gender of our baby and my husband and I are scuba divers. We thought this would be perfect for our nursery. I too was wondering how long the border is. I called my local store and found out it is 10 yards (30 feet) long. Hope this helps some of you.
4,"Sea Life - Curtains, switchplate & nightlight","I wasn't able to find this set on any other websites either. I called KidsLine Inc directly at (310)660-0110. There is a matching switchplate & nightlight but they won't be in stores until this November'05. There are also matching curtains which are not listed anywhere in the store or on the website - but they have to be special ordered directly from babies r us. They come 2 panels in a package with tie-backs and are 84"" long by 54"" wide for approx $45.99 per set. Delivery time is 5 to 7 weeks."
4,Hard to put up,"I do love the border, but the directions could be better on how to put it up. You really have to soak it, and then hold it forever before it fully sticks. Once it's up, however, it's up and looks great!"
5,Compelling,"Very interesting, powerfull and graphic portrayal of the ongoing conflicts and tragedies in Africa. Quite educational about the different factions and interests. Story moves rapidly, no flat spots. Great work."
5,Fantastic,this movie gave me an addicting personality.i read the first manga then heard about the movie and watched it. I laughed I cried then laughed some more.i ordered the 2nd one on sunday and cant wait to recieve it today!!!I would recommend this movie to anyone.even if you dont like foreign films...my mother hates them but she is getting more and more into them..her current obsession..Moon child. Also another good movie!!ENJOYYYY!
3,Light-hearted fun with a side of Tokyo Cool,"To read the synopsis, and from watching the first 5 minutes or so, you might be put off this film by how trivial it appears. And, well, it IS a trivial movie. Not much happens and you know how things will end in the end but that's part of its charm. It doesn't take itself too seriously and at its heart is a very sweet tale of friendship between two quite different young women. Basically, the 3 star rating is for people who, like me, are interested in Japan and the Japanese music scene. In the same way that a lover of Japan would have had a greater appreciation for Lost in Translation than the average cinema goer. Personally, I'm ordering the sequel, aptly titled Nana 2, but if Japanese culture (particularly J-rock) doesn't do it for you, you'd be best looking elsewhere."
3,not like the anime,didnt like the movie its not like the series. music is so different then the series. story line is almost the same to the anime but you have to read the subtitle if u want to in english
4,Enchanting,"This book (and its sequels) are some of the best guilty pleasures I've ever had. They are good, enchanting children's novels that stay good into your teens (as I can say, seeing as I've reread them this year and I'm 15). I've loved these books for years, and I'd recommend them to any little girl."
4,a girl who loves her father very much has to part with him,This book was such a great book! I loved it. I am looking forward to reading the sequal to the book. The book made me laugh in part and then in some parts it made me sad. I think anybody would like this book.
4,MOLL'S HEART,this book can be varry tuchy to some people.and some parts willmake you laugho or make you sad. It's an emotinoal story to reed
5,"Great Looking, Affordable Frame",Very classy and perfect for hanging up a photo or any other small document in style. I used it to frame an animation cell from The Lion King and it looks sweet.
3,nice to have but poor quality,"It's great to be able to have these episodes, but they are pretty poor in quality. Shame shame on TV Guide for putting their good name on this.I'd love to see the Ellery Queen series with Jim Hutton released!"
2,Banacek,"My husband and were looking forward to seeing this series.The first show was SO boring, we finally just quit watching it.Actually, we haven't gotten around to watching anymore. I guess we were afraid of a repeat.Maybe that was just once, I hope!"
5,Banacek- The First Season,"I like the murder mysteries from this era. Columbo, McMillan & Wife, etc. Just entertainment. I don't have to worry what the grandkids will see or hear. No gore, bad language or too much skin showing. This is a great set."
5,Puts your mind to work in solving the mysteries.,"These shows are excellent brain teasers. At the end of each episode, Banacek takes you back to certain clues that he saids helped him in solving the mystery of the missing items. I found this show very interesting and you shouldn't walk away from the tv without put it on pause or you will miss an important clue in solving the mystery. If you are a Columbo or Poirot fan. This set is in your taste. The dvd color quality is excellent. I anticipate the next season."
1,DVD quality poor,"5 stars for banacek, deduct 4 for the dvd quality.the dvd opens with the usual anti-copying sob story, then when you getto episode #3 (disk 1), it is full of dvd rot. Another couple of viewings andbanacek will make a nice coaster."
5,Good Dvd,Good dvd to watch when you really do not know what you want to watch other than reruns of the season of shows you normally watch. It will bring back memories if you are as old as I am. Remembreing who was there watching it with you. Its a good find and enjoyable!!!!!!
4,Exotic tale,"I really have enjoyed this series. It is an easy, cozy up to a fire with a warm blanket story. I love the historical background, the exotic descriptions and the mystical references. The descriptions of sacred ritual interwoven into the story are very filling for me.I would highly recommend book 1 - Harem Sister, before reading this one, they really do go together. Michele does a good job of retelling importent parts of the story so that if you don't read it, it's o.k. but it would be a much better reading experience if you had read #1 first."
3,Not bad,"The bracelet is made of nice materials and is well made. It's a little stiff due to the surgical steel middle band, but otherwise great.Notice that the metal bars on the three stands slide - so if you get them caught on something or move them they will slide up and down the bracelet which causes some shaving of the rubber strands."
2,Looks Nice - Not Very Durable,"I got one of these bracelets for my boyfriend. He loved the look and feel of it, but immediately after trying it on, the center cable came out of the end holder. Ended up returning it. Seller did make the return process very easy, so that was a big plus. Maybe mine was just defective, but I wasn't going to risk it again - ended up getting a different product."
3,Sylish bracelet!,"The silver steel and black rubber look good together and match well with any outift. But, the clasp is a little hard to undo and lock on."
2,very dissatisfied,This bracelet is not very durable it broke after my husband wore it twice. I had to send it back and get a refund. I would'nt recommend this for anyone.
2,Not Worth the Money,This bracelet did not fit well at all... it didn't help that the bracelet was warped. The clasp was very difficult to use as well. I have purchased other items from Sabrina before and have been very happy but this one is going back.
5,Great Catch!,"At first, I thought this bracelet doesn't fit in my big wrist but I was wrong. Great catch in a worth price. It took 3 days (Standard Shipping) and I have the item. Simple, Durable and stylish bracelet. Thank you and I loved it."
4,Great Tunes! These songs get stuck in your head...and that's a good thing!,Each song on here is unique and melodic. The lead singer has a great voice. Lyrics are written with great thought and soul.
3,Technological advances quickly surpassed capabilities,"I was very happy with this receiver until BD and HDMI technology hit the stage. The sound produced by this receiver is very, very good, but there are no HDMI inputs so I'm stuck using optical or analog out. I'm in the market now for a new receiver because this one is simply outdated.If you don't mind the lack of HDMI inputs, this receiver is a fantastic buy."
4,vainless beauty,"I really liked this book because the character, Allie, a very beautiful model, isn't concerned with war-scarred Rafe's looks. She shows that love can conquer anything, even a reluctant lover. :)"
3,Disappointment,"Because it doesn't come complete. You have to buy sour cream. The finished product tastes wonderful, though."
4,Good Book,"It was a good book had to read it for my English 102 class, but not something I would have read on my own, the writing style of Cormac McCarthy is ok."
4,Good price,I got what I paid for.I got what I paid forI got what I paid forI got what I paid forI got what I paid for.
4,"Cute book, Flushing sound is a little weird",My son likes the book; it's cute. But the flushing sound isn't necessary and sounds a little like a turkey's gobble.
2,Just the facts...,"This is a pretty nuts and bolts approach to preparing an NIH grant and reads much like the pages on the NIH websites. It has nicely brought together a lot of the detailed information (different types of grants, different application deadlines, etc) that is on the NIH websites and into a somewhat more user friendly format. But do not think about buying this book to help you actually WRITE a grant. This is for novices who don't know a K01 from a P01. If looking for help in preparing the best possible grant, I suggest the books by Ogden or Yang."
1,Seriously Outdated Due to Changes at NIH,"While we have long recommended this book to our classes, it has NOT been updated to reflect the radical changes NIH has made to its reviewing criteria, acceptable proposal length, and even the section names and purposes. (This is true for most books on grant writing you'll find here; anything with a copyright date before 2009 is guaranteed to be useless, and 2009 books are very iffy.)"
2,Too heavy and poor scraper placement,"This is a nice premium snow brush with soft bristles that wont scratch your car paint. Unfortunately, it is noticeably heavier that your standard brush and your arm will feel it if there is a lot of snow on your car. The worst feature is the scraper located next to the brush head. When using the brush the pointed edges of the scraper will often make contact with your car and leave scratches on your paint."
5,Excellent snow brush,This brush/scraper is the best. It made snow removal off the top of the SUV a breeze! Another great Oxo product.
1,You know by the introduction where this book is headed,A book that is dedicated to a trinitarian god and then quotes a spurious verse should not be taken seriously.Obviously the author is dishonest or has not done any indepth research.
2,What was Guillou thinking?,"In my ongoing search for recordings of Reubke's Piano Sonata I ran accross Jean Guillou's CD. His performance of the Piano Sonata seemed rather sloppy. Rhythms did not line up and difficult passages were glossed over. I could hardly follow along with the score as he had no rhythmic integrity. The Organ Sonata was marginally better. Fortunately it lacked the improvised Guillou-style cadenza he seems to feel necessary in certain performances (i.e. 1st movement, Widor 6). I can't recommend this CD for those interested in redeemble performances of Reubke's masterpieces."
2,Made of Fail,"The sword and scabbard in the picture have little in common with what I received. The scabbard is red with decorative pieces along the sides. I wouldn't mind so much if said pieces were not falling out. The part of the hilt that points out along the base of the blade is bent out of shape away from the blade. The gold colored pieces in the hilt are not fully inserted on one side, and bent in at the edges at the other. Usable as decor, but not so pretty close up.Do not recommend."
2,it doth fail,"I purchased mine some time ago but recognized the product immediately as it is known as my joke dagger. The scabbard is plastic and cracked in half so it is now a top piece and a bottom piece, the gold inserts are askew and the blade is completely dull and prone to rust. The chains on the scabbard fell off almost immediately and the hilt rattles. I love it, but it is completely non-threatening."
2,Poor craftmanship,The casted handle doesn't match and it loose without a means to tighten. Thumping the blade causing bad vibrating noise.
1,Nothing like the previous Stereo Sushi cds,"I adore Stereo Sushi... I have all the previous cds (except for vol. 8). I can't stress enough how different this one is to the ones before. It's a completely different genre of music! If you are thinking of buying this because you like the others, you will be highly disappointed. I can't believe they are even calling this 'Stereo Sushi'."
4,Good utility clogs,"I've had a pair of these before, and they are perfect little slip-ins for light visits to the garden, taking the dogs outside, or going to get the paper. They are not sufficient for heavy duty gardening such as tilling or spading (proper work shoes are a must there) but for a visit to get a few fresh veggies or to do light work around the house, these are great."
3,OK Clogs,"These clogs are exactly what you pay for, which is about 15 bucks worth. They are not really designed for long term comfort but they do get the job done. At first my feet didn't feel like they belonged in them but over the last couple of weeks I have gotten use to them. I will use these clogs on occasion but I will look for better and more comfortable clogs for long term use. I do like the fact that you can scrub these clogs down and disinffect them for health care use."
2,Highly overpriced,"Although it looks quite nice from a distance, it is really very cheap and poorly made. If it was priced around 15/20 dollars, it would be reasonable. We purchased one a couple of years ago, and I am now shopping for another (different one) as it did not last. The first to go was the clock. It stopped working after only several MONTHS (and, yes, we tried new batteries). After less than a year, the plastic cover fell out. And next, of course, the paper that is glued onto the base with the numbers on it inevitably curled up and peeled off. As far as accuracy goes, it wasn't too bad in the beginning. I had to adjust it frequetnly, but as time went on it became more and more inaccurate - reading at least 20-30 degrees off at all times. Please don't waste your money."
1,Hunk of Junk,"The first one of these I order, the clock mechanism didn't work. Got a replacement sent. This one didn't work either. Save yourself a lot of trouble on returns by avoiding this piece of junk."
2,Cheap,"This item is made from cheap, thin plastic and has a very loud tick. From a distance the appearance is acceptable, and the lightness will make it easy to hang up securely. For what you get, it is overpriced."
3,Only one problem with these adorable puppets.,"My 2 year old granddaughter loved these puppets from the beginning. They are well made and represent a family which makes for great pretend play. I rotated with her from being the mommy, daddy, sister, and brother. But, there is one BIG flaw with these puppets. I could not, and either could she, get your hand in so that you can operate the arms and mouth. For some reason, they made the lining too small and you can't push your hand all the way in to the arms and hands and you can't even get close to the mouth which is made to open and close.That being said, she still enjoyed them but I think for what they cost (or for that matter, regardless of what they cost, you should be able to operate them the way they were meant to work."
5,A smash hit for the birthday girl,"We purchased this puppet set for our neghbor's 4th birthday. She loves them...when she can get them away from her older cousins! Well-made, easy to use with little (or large) hands,and limited only by her imagination."
4,Family Puppets great except the man,The family puppets were great. The daddy puppet however did not have a neck hole big enough to get a child's hand in it! The other three were fine.
4,a grandson's gift,My grandson likes to make up plays with puppets so I got him these. One of them was difficult to get the hand in place so as to control the arms so could have been put together better but he played with them anyway
2,the title of the book is misleading,"I have always wanted a guide for writing online. Unfortunately the closest I have come up with is usability's guru: Jacob Nielsen.Thinking of this book as ""copywriting online guide"" I thought I have found my solution. Unfortunately, I realized soon that this book is more about marketing online that about writing for the web. It will help you sell, but its only chapter ""writing for the Internet"" is not the ultimate guide of writing online."
3,Subject matter written time after time,"I'd recommend this to novice internet entreprenuers looking for advice, but this likely won't be the end-all text goldmine you're hoping for.If you're one who reads as many online business and marketing books as possible, this information presents nothing new or innovative. It *may* pose an interesting read while at your local bookstore, but not necessarily something worth keeping on your home/office shelf."
3,"Too many copywriting rules, not enough tech.","This book was very similar to Bly's previous books which went through the basic tenets of copywriting. He does a great job of transferring the ""writing to sell"" principles to web pages in this book, but I wish he would have touched more on the technical aspects. Many writers are looking to learn how to approach writing for Flash or any new web language of the day... and we need something that brings us into that territory. With this book, it was close but no cigar."
4,An enjoyable and educational read.,A lot of this information was already known as I've been writing on the web for years. but I learned some new twists and will be a better writer on my websites because of this book.
2,Not up to Bob Bly's normal standards,"I like Bob Bly's easy-to-read style. And he usually offers great tips and sage advice. In fact, every now and again, I'll pull out my copy of ""The Copywriter's Handbook"" for reference or ideas. It's a must read for any writer just starting out. But I struggled through this book until I eventually had to stop reading about three-quarters of the way through. It seemed to lack his normal flow. And he relied heavily on other ""experts"" for advice (which now are probably quite dated). I got the impression that Bly was trying to capitalize on a hot market without fully knowing the subject matter. It wasn't terrible--you will find some good tidbits in it--but it's far from his best work."
2,What?!,"If you read the preface to decide if you should purchase a book, be sure to read this book's. Read between the lines and you will decipher that the author understands he is not the foremost expert on Franklin. Nor does he intend this book to be a reference for history majors. He also says that he tries to use the quotes from the volumes of letters written by Franklin as the basis for this book. What?! Then why did I read this book? That's my fault.However, I will say that the author delivers on his promise. He clumsily intertwines the quotes. Adds his own inconsistent opinions based on his lack of expert knowledge. And says he respects Franklin, but I'm not sure if he really knows.I couldn't wait to finish this book."
2,Benjamin Franklin,"It is unsettling to find in the first few pages of Benjamin Franklin by Edmund S. Morgan that its noted author refers to the Gulf Stream as being a ""western flow of current that slowed down ships traveling eastward"". How much confidence can I place in the factual content of the rest of the book?"
1,Maybe the worst biography I've read.,"Skipping over trivial events such as Franklin's actual birth and death, this book gleans over the seminal events of Franklin's time, and Franklin's lfe. I understand this is a SHORT biography, but I am confused why the author obsesses w/ ""Franklin the British Imperialist"", while ignoring ""Franklin the Legend"". I got the point about Franklin seeing himself as a good English subject after the first 20 pages. Oh, and as for all of those memorable quotes that have been attributed to Franklin? Not a one in this book. Lastly, who edited this book? There were more typos then I've ever seen in a book of this length. Skip it folks."
1,A medicine for insomnia,"This book is terrible. You'll be asleep within 10 minutes of opening it, regardless of what page. Look elsewhere if you're interested in Franklin."
4,A must read for Ben!,Edmund Morgan presents a very different approach to analyzing Ben Franklin's life. He does not go day by day or even year by year but instead looks at the overall legacy. While I think this is an interesting way to look at Franklin's life it is not as useful as Benjamin Franklin: An American Life by Walter Isaacson. It is still possible to learn a lot about his cultural legacy and intellectual legacy. I did learn things about Ben Franklin that I had not from other biographies because this does stick to the large picture. This book does cover the essentials as others have noted but I think it also sets a new and exciting trend for biographies. To get the place of a person in history it is worth looking at how they fit in to larger events as opposed to just their life. Morgan's writing is very engaging and this is a valuable addition to the literature on Benjamin Franklin.
4,Solid introduction to Franklin,"This is the third book I've read by Morgan and the typical qualities we've come to expect are here: compression without superficiality, academic rigor with lucidity, and a good nose for the telling anecdote."
4,Amazing look at Wipeout overseas,I'm so glad this season included a look at Wipeout in other countries. Very very funny episode and an amazing look into the differences between the US and Australia.
5,Great,This box is perfect to have all the basic ipod accesories at once. I have the 60 mb video ipod and all the accesories works perfect.
4,Video On,"If you haven't bought any Ipod accessories and you want them, then this is a good deal for $100.Seperately:1. Doc:$402. AC Adapter:$403. Remote:$304. USB connector cable:$205. AV splitter cable:30 - It's kinda short(If you want to play video though just make sure that you turn on the video out setting!)"
2,Not worth reading,"Usually a book is redeemable if it has one of two positives: a good plot (even if the writing isn't great) or fantastic writing (even if the plot isn't great). This book had neither. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters, and the so-called hilarity consisted of two jokes (an old woman having sex and spam email) that were dragged out the entire way through the novel. Plus, you can predict everything that's going to happen with every character from page 10.Usually I pass all of my books along to friends when I'm finished, but this one went straight into the trashcan by the pool. I'm a fan of so-called beach reads but in this case, you'd be better off making a sand castle."
3,Just alright....,"The book seemed just a little too long, especially when you knew what was coming. Sue Margolis' Spin Cycle and Apcalipstick was much better and moved along quicker. Breakfast st Stephanie's had good humor but I just got bored by page 200."
4,Margolis writes another winner!,"Breakfast at Stephanie's is a delight from start to finish. If you're looking for a light, predictable jaunt through one woman's struggle with family, love and career- this is the book! It's another Margolis classic, she really knows how to build likeable characters and keep dialogue interesting. You'll love this british chick-lit novel."
5,Perfect,"I barely had to wait for this to arrive. Needless to say, I received it very quickley. It has all the stuff I wanted, and it is perfect."
2,Not that great,"Not particularly funny or titillating, just most unlikable characters and a weak plot. Pity that."
4,Rant,"I liked the anime so therefore I liked the dvd set. Thankfully they weren't some grainy quality. Overall, it's a good buy."
5,Loved it!,This anime put a smile on my face and I had lots of fun watching it. This anime is a keeper.
1,not all that,"I bought this for my son. He has had nothing but trouble with it. I really dont know much about the guns, however, I have taken it to a dealer. He has worked on the gun a couple of times. It still leaks air. We have changed orings, bottles, re-read the instructions but still having problems. The gun is a very nice looking and balanced well. However, I fell like we bought a paint job. I would not recommend this gun. But like I said I know little about the different brands, so maybe we just got a lemon."
3,Good product but I've been unable to use.,"I purchased this product for under sink storage in my kitchen. However, when it came I saw it needed to be screwed into the bottom of the cabinet to use. If I had known this previously I would not have purchased the product. I live in an apartment, so I can't really be putting holes in cabinets. But, I did keep the product because I would like to have it for when I purchase a home."
3,Handy pullout,Putting this thing together was ok . it fit well and made my mom and me so happy. two shelves with ample clearance for tall things.
4,Very pleased,"Assembles fairly easy. Arrived earlier than expected. A little wider than expected - wife measured wrong, but still a great product. Will order from this seller again."
2,The size is too big for any of our cabinet undersink and we have a regular size undersink cabinet,"I ended not using it but because I threw away the boxes already I couldn't return it. There is no problem with the product, except that it is too big for any of our undersink. I would recommend this to anyone but please check the size before buying!!"
4,Last Will & Testament details,"Well written, well presented, a very interesting reference or curio bookWills; a dead giveaway,Wills A Dead GiveawayWills. A Dead Giveaway"
4,Polly Wants a Wardrobe!,"I can't say how many Polly Pockets my 5 year-old daughter has. I think they multiply when I'm not looking. Certainly I find little parts of her wardrobe everywhere in the house and car and vacuum cleaner. But Oh how a little girl can love this collection. And so, this mom, like many others, grins and bears it.I think this particular collection is not only a good buy but a very good idea because half of the fun for little girls is changing the costumes, having adventures, and then changing them again.With this purchase you get 12 outfits and a few pairs of shoes and boots. The case, as pointed out, is not worth all that much. AND the packaging... grrr...don't get me started. This thing could have been blasted out of a cannon to Mars and the little outfits would still be in place; each in their little bubble. Arrggh. Have scissors and a box knife ready.Five Stars. A good purchase for the Doll who needs clothes for all seasons."
3,"Well it's ok,","Hi well to start I got this for Easter one year and I was real excited I couldn't wait to open it. I did and the clothes are cute and so is the doll but does she have on a swimsuit for underwear? And it's a little boring cause there's not a lot of stuff to do but dress her. (Which is half the fun but still,) Well gotta go hope this was helpful Brooke."
5,an10 yr. old,I luv this toy!Plus she has alot of fasions!I highly recommend you buying this!.-amanda
5,A Convenient Way to Keep Your Favorite Tea In Stock,"My wife loves Lipton Lemon Herbal Tea, but can't always find it in local stores. Amazon's subscription service is a great way to ensure her supply doesn't run out, and it's less expensive than retail!"
5,The very best lemon tea!,"This lemon-flavored herbal tea surpasses all similar teas of other brands, and I tried them all. From obscure, expensive boutique teas to grocery store teas. I am so afraid that Lipton will stop making it. My favorite products always have a habit of being discontinued, for some reason. We used to be able to get it in any grocery store, but gradually the tea became harder to find, and currently, it's only available on line. This tea is full-bodied, fragrant, light, lemony, but not ""herby, or grassy or with hay overtones"". I drink it day and night, summer and winter, hot or cold, with no additional sweeteners. It's perfect the way it is."
2,Not what I expected,"I thought this was one I had gotten oversees, but this was not it. Its too heavy and not light and clear. Did not like this product."
2,"First disc fine, second disc had problems playing","The title says it well. Despite a sealed copy, plus a sealed replacement copy from an Amazon seller, fine performance for the first disc that played in both regular and portable CD players, but the second disk, 80 minutes long, had skips and failed to complete play. NAXOS engineering/pressing probably at fault."
4,My son loves the octopus too,"My 2 month old son gets big smile on his face every time the octopus passes over head. And the other animals get smiles too just not as big as for the octopus.I'd have given this mobile 5 stars if I didn't have to keep winding it. If they ever make a battery powered one that I can leave on for a while, that will get my 5 star rating!"
3,Just Not Long Enough,"My daughter absolutely loves this mobile, especially the octopus that spins while the moblie goes around. She could watch it for hours! The only thing I don't like about it is that it just doesn't play long enough. I feel like I spend more time winding it up than watching my daughter enjoy it."
5,pretty mobile,My baby loves watching this mobile go round. It really is very cute. It only goes around for a couple of minutes though. And you can't get the motion without the sound.
5,a sensitive soundtrack,"This CD is a journey on board to the world of sounds conquered by the Portuguese in the golden age of sailing times to the so desired way to India.The CD Os Lusíadas is a result of the soundtrack created for the theatre play 'The Lusiadas', produced by Ruth Escobar in 2000 in So Paulo. It is the first Portuguese version of this great epic with music by Magda Pucci that, with her group Mawaca did a wonderful job with the poetry of Cames.[...]"
4,the crow: stairway to heaven,"I'm not always a big fan of gothic type shows or books, but I really enjoyed this series and was disappointed to find out that it only lasted one season. I admit, I do not remeber when I first stated watching, but I got hooked right away and could not wait to see the next episode! one day, they played a marathon on tv and I got snacks and just curled up and watched for hours. so glad it's on dvd! (plus, it doesn't hurt when the actor is good looking as well as very talented)"
5,Finally!,"Unlike most, I have never seen any of The Crow movies. I know they were good and someday I will. With that said, I LOVED this series. The story lines and especially the music was great. In a time of Hercules, Xena, and other adventures, this was a great escape into another world. I thought it was well done and can't wait to buy it!"
5,The Crow: Stairway To Heaven,I love this show. I was sorry to see it cancelled. I lobbied the company to bring it out on DVD and I was really happy to see it come out.
2,Such a shame...,"This really upsets me, I have such high hopes for all of The Crow movies. I am a huge obsessed fan. I own all of the movies, have shirts, hoodies, posters, comics, necklaces, wallets, and even own the ORIGINAL CROW comforter which in this day and age is RARE. I agree, the Crow movies DID get worse as they came out. However I actually DID enjoy City Of Angels. Wicked Prayer however... worst 5$ ever spent (lol). I do however think that the sound tracks for all of the movies are really good. I've seen some of this, and although I like him better as 'The Crow' than the last two guys from the last two movies. But, the acting however is very bad. Very cheesy. But since I am such a huge obsessed fan, I probably will be adding this to my collection just because. (LOL)."
3,I'd like to give it more.,"Jan and her husband are fine people and Jan writes some lovely songs. This album is very good for an amature project and I hope one day it could be re-recorded in a professional studio just to improve some of the production values. Go on christian record companies, give this woman a break. The songs themselves can inspire the listener so don't be put off by my 3 stars."
4,Wonderful book!,I loved this book! It really gave lots of in depth information on Hollywood haunted places. It was alot of fun and captivating to read!
2,Looks Great - Less Filling,"I bought this book at the LA County Library Gift Shop a year ago. It looks great, and offers some interesting 'ghostly' tales about Lon Chaney, Bela Lugosi, Ozzie Nelson and others, but I wasn't as satisfied or convinced as I had hoped to be. It gave me the same sort of feeling I get when watching one of the E! Channels ""Hollywood Mysteries & Scandals"" shows -- a lot of supposition, second and third hand ghost sightings (there are a few first hand, OK)and I was left with that Ripley's Believe it or Not feeling. Maybe I wanted apparitions to fly out of the pages and fly around the room -- I don't know. But it didn't do it for me. Nice effort, though. Boo."
4,Interesting with great photos,"Although the book could be longer, it is definitely interesting and worth adding to either your Hollywood or paranormal collection. I was also pleasantly surprised by how well written it is. Finally, the book design is good, and the photos are excellent."
5,Fabulous Reading-----Very Informative-couldn't put it down!,"Wonderfully told, believable information and highly entertaining! Really well done, easy reading-the photos are beautiful and bring the reader a huge sense of nostalgia.I am looking forward to more from this talented author!"
5,Good Halloween Read...,"This book has been out for a while... Its recently been updated... Too bad most of these locations are not available to visit... I can only imagine Ozzy Nelson haunting his old house, and grabbing on the women there...Wow! Read this if you love old ghost stories with our favorite old stars in them!"
2,Ghosts of Hollywood,"Haunted Hollywood has been discussed and presented on cable network, E! And various other channels such as History Channel, A&E, Entertainment Tonight, Unsolved Mysteries and other entertainment news programs. There are many websites, which gives the reader plenty of information. This book contains limited information and falls short of satisfying real ghost enthusiasts. The author could have expanded to include more haunted stories and perhaps more details. The reader could invest his/her money on something else and read from websites."
5,Khyber Knights,"The day I picked up this magnificent book I was transported to a world talked about my Parents and Grandparents, the NWFP. Many a tales were told over the years, some believable and some not. Asadullah Khan's epic journey through Pakistan and his experiences are recorded for posterity. Like Homer's Odyssey and The Iliad, the Khyber Knights is truly a superb achievement. Asadullah Khan a ""man of twists and turns"" meets all the challenges thrown at him in the land that is seldom understood by the West is indeed a mammoth achievement. A convert to Islam, and above all a keen horseman, Asadullah Khan has written the book in such a way that all senses become alive and one is actually ""living the experience"". I would recommend this book to anyone, whether he or she be an equestrian or otherwise, a book that has to be read not just once but many times over! ""Saddle up now, here's to your luck, great days from this day on!"""
4,Khyber Knights - a learning adventure,"My family had spent time in Pakistan and since September 11th I have had many unanswered questions about Pakistan and Afghanistan.This story, Khyber Knights, has given me a great glimpse of this wild country - a place of mysterious people, danger and yet at the same time, kindly and generous people and peace-loving religions.And all this from the back of a horse! What magnificent horses!I look forward to reading more of CuChullaine O'Reilly's stories."
5,Incredible Adventure,"Here is a book that makes us all aware of how far the every day boundaries of adventure can be stretched. I own a company called Unicorn Trails that provides horse riding holidays. We deal in making peoples dreams and adventures a reality in a small way. With this book CuChullaine O'Reilly has not only taken these boundaries and made them appear irrelevant, but he has done so in such an eloquent and insightful way that armchair travellers feel as if they have been there and experienced it themselves. Highly recommended reading whether you are ever going to sit on a horse or not."
2,Mediocre at best,"Camberwell Beauty is a fairly ordinary chick-lit novel with few redeeming values. I found the story to be fragmented and difficult at best- I felt that the author was more interested in bashing the ugly daughter of the main character rather than creating a coherent plot. I found it difficult to follow.It's not at all amusing, and the jokes are cliched and mainstream. This book's fine if you've got plenty of time on your hands and are a devotee of the genre, but otherwise, stay away."
5,This is great.,I have a Jeep Wrangler and this is great for long trips and camping. Holds a nice load and holds up to weather.
5,Immense production talent coupled with the voice of an angel.,"I have heard plenty of great vocals accross many genres, but this woman has a voice of rapture. I love her voice above that of any other I have ever heard. The music is beautiful and deep and I cannot get enough of it. I am a fan of Artemis for life and would feel honored to meet this unbelievably talented woman and her group. This is the kind of music that should be at the top of the Bilboards not this flavor of the month talentless and rather tasteless excuse for music that often ends up on top. No offense to Lady Gaga, but she can't touch Artemis. There is really nothing else I can say about this album that the other reviewers haven't said. I just had to comment on how much I love her music. So, all the best to you Artemis, you have scored another adoring fan!"
5,Dream Journey,"I discovered Artemis through the Magnatune website and was immediately drawn in by the first track. The album is cohesive, a non-stop dreamy trip hop through sound and time. Unlike some ""trance"" music, this album has a lot of body and substance. You can envision it as a soundtrack to some really good animated Japanese manga, or maybe a gritty foreign film. It is both ethereal and gripping. The singer at times reminds me of Bjork, in a really accessible way.This is music to seduce to, a soundtrack for martinis and curling tendrils of smoke, sophisticated and smooth. Put this one on the next time you need background music that won't overwhelm while still setting a fabulous mood.Frankly at this price it's worth giving the album a try, whether you're a seasoned Trance/Mood fan or this is your first journey into the ether."
3,NOT BIG-BONED,"I like jewelry, but I practically never wear it. Men with big, sinewey hands with large knuckles and serpentine veins can wear jewelry pretty easily, and it looks good on them. I can't. My hands have tapering fingers, and my wrists are unobtrusive. Not small, mine are musician's or surgeon's hands, perhaps. So, anything I wear has to be subtle in design and modest in scale. MINIMALIST JEWELRY. (The Seventies are gone, if not forgotten.)This is the only bangle I've bought and worn in thirty or more years. It looks absolutely great, and balances against either a leather strap watch or one with a bracelet. Very light, but doesn't look it. The shape prevents it from spinning on one's wrist as one types, or eats or uses one's hands. Silent. Doesn't get tangled up in anything. There's a very discreet hinge and fastening device.This is something that might appeal to and be suitable for a MOMA kind of guy."
2,bad visual art,the poems were great but the pictures are rather distractingand have nothing to do with love what-so-ever
5,Quick readings,We are using this at our Self Storage facility to verify temperature and humidity settings in our Climate Control Storage. The readings are quick and accurate and allow us to control costs while meeting the needs of our tenants.
1,Here's why I do NOT recommend this item:,"1. There are seams in the corners which are VERY difficult to clean.2. After using this pan only 5 times, it discolored.I'm sorry I bought this particular brand/design in 3 sizes. :("
2,Not so great,"The corners have seams which trap food easily. It is VERY difficult to clean--I have to use toothpicks to get the corners clean. In addition the pan stains easily and no amount of scrubbing can eliminate the stains. Would NOT recommend. There are surely better pans out there. The only impressive thing about this pan is its hefty weight. Other than that, don't bother with it."

1,"Such Potential, Such Disappointment","Anticipated reading a good book that would provide greater insights into the beliefs of the people generically referred to as Celtic. Instead, I discovered a book that offered no real new insights into the life of the Celts. Rather, I found a book that mixed a personal pilgrimage with rudimentary insights. Scholarly, the book left this reader longing for something far more than that contained within the covers of the book. For those readers who desire a ""romantic"" view of the Celtic people, the book may prove rewarding. However, if one earnestly desires to learn more about the practices and lives of the Celts, I would recommend turning to a different author. (Oliver Davies' work is among the best!)"
4,Music to lie down and die to,"When one finds an ensemble of musicians who have chosen a time and a place to honour, or replicate, or interpret with skillful passion, take note and investigate for yourself what distant scenery could inspire artists so.Joan The Mad deserves such respect. I hardly review or rate albums, but this particular one deserves a notation. The album begins on a sordid note that is the doorway to an ancient place of exotic sounds blended with classical givens. The Moors have made their mark on this Iberian album that gives a sense of ancient Arabian masters feasting with their Spanish hosts.Pause to open this doorway and enter a forgotten time and listen to music classical in genre, yet forever a stranger to the ears."
5,very interestig,"muy interesanta, bueno para instruir a los que más lo necesitan, y los que no, también."
3,Damaged CD cover,"The music is fine and playable, but the front of the plastic CD case had a big crack in it."
5,A String of Pearls fit for a Select Few,"It is a travesty that anyone could claim to find this masterpiece ""boring."" Proust's novel belongs in that select pantheon of books that truly deserved to be called Classics. A finer study of human nature (amongst other things) one will not find anywhere."
4,It does what needs to be done,"What can you say about a hangar unless it doesn't work? It does it's job, it's not flashy, or color coordinated, but it holds up skirts double hung (I hang 2 from each set of clips, one on each side). It doesn't seem to be bending at all, and fits perfectly in my closet. I'm content with my purchase."
4,Not bad,"Not as nice as the ones I got at Bed Bath & Beyond, but they're not as expensive, either. Upon arrival, a few of the rubber caps on the ends of the wire bits were missing, but since those shouldn't come into contact with clothing, I'm not worried about it. They seem sturdy, even if not as much as my others. I'd buy them again, in fact, since I seem to have far more pants & skirts than I'd originally thought, I may have to buy more!"
5,Love em,I bought a few of these to try and organize my closet and give me more room. The hangers did everything I thought they would. I saved a lot of horizontal closet hanging space letting me see everything easier. These hangers are great. I only wish I would have found them sooner.
1,Flimsy and hard to use.,"The rubber/silicone caps on the ends of the metal tiers fall right off if bumped, exposing rather sharp unpolished edges. Three fell off just while removing the plastic wrap from the packaging. They seem a bit too large for the diameter of the metal rods, and unable to stay attached as a result.When adjusting the positions of the clips, they do not slide smoothly. Even worse, one clip fell apart the second I pinched the top to open it--the metal spring flew up into my face.Similar products I have purchased elsewhere (and almost identical in materials and appearance) were made to a higher standard, and have held up for years. These are falling apart straight out of the wrapper.Won't purchase this brand again."
1,Worst packaging I have ever seen,"The hangers seem ok, a bit thinner than I expected. They are loosely attached to the center rod so they move around quite a bit which is not ideal.The thing that has me writing this review is the packaging in which I received the item. It was sealed between two sheets of bubble wrap. It took me over an hour with a pair of scissors and brute strength to wrestle this hanger out of the package. The plastic bubble wrap was sealed to itself, like a vacuum pack, such that every piece of the hanger had to be individually peeled out of the very strong plastic.Unacceptable!"
3,Might help a little.,"This is the second type of hanger I've purchased to save closet space. They work as advertised, but they really don't save much space, unless you work at it a little. The space is taken up by clothes, so stacking them on a multiple hanger doesn't do much. However, if you alternate sides and manage to get some items higher or lower than others, you can save a bit of space. It would be easier to buy a bigger house with a bigger closet. :)"
2,Not very sturdy,"This 6 tier blouse hanger is not very sturdy. Each end of the hanger is welded to the center, rather than being one full length of metal. I had the 6 tier hanger on a doorknob prior to putting it in the closet, and my husband banged into it when going through the doorway, which broke off one side of one of the tiers. Then, somehow, another side of one of the tiers broke.So, I would not recommend this, unless you take the greatest care to not let it get banged into."
1,Didn't like...,"I think I didn't like these pant racks because I could never figure out how to use them. They're made of some pretty thick stainless steel, but honesly, getting more than a couple pairs of pants on one of these things is a chore.."
1,disappointed,Ordered the six tier received a 4 tier. took long to get here lousy product and service...
4,"Okay, could be cheaper","This is a good product and saved me lots of space in my closet, it's just too bad I found it afterwards at Dollar General for $3.00."
4,Great way to get organized,"I like the way the individual sections lock. I used them on my husband's jeans. He is 6'3"" so the jeans are long. Did a real nice job. Plan to get a couple more."
5,More closet space,I bought this for my mother- in law who has moved to assisted living and had very little closet space. It was easy to use and has given her much more space.
2,"Ok, but not all it's cracked up to be.","This isn't the easiest item to use. It's fairly durable, but it is difficult to use the arms to balance out your pants. If you put too much on the top or bottom it swings out and becomes difficult to put your pants on the arms. It does save space though and can carry a lot of weight."
3,Misleading presentation,"This is not a review of HUNTER QUARTERMAIN'S STORY, so please don't take the three stars too seriously. It should be said, though, that what is presented in this book as ""Zikali the Wizard,"" a short story and, evidently, a rarity, is just a passage from the novel CHILD OF STORM. Haining is to be censured for not making this clear. He even lists ""Zikali"" as one of not quite twenty items in the Quatermain Saga, between CHILD OF STORM and ""A Tale of Three Lions."" This would be like taking the chapter ""Riddles in the Dark"" from Tolkien's THE HOBBIT and implying it is a rare short story about Bilbo."
3,Not what was pictured,"I haven't installed this yet, so I can't say how well it works. However, anyone ordering this should be aware that it is NOT as pictured in the product photos. There are only half of the parts shown in the package you receive. Evidently, the photo must show 2 complete kits. Still seems like a good value, but somewhat disappointing."
4,An unusual 20th century opera in an ancient Greek setting,"Peggy Glanville-Hicks has provided a rather unusual opera based on the myth of Nausicaa and Ulysses. This is a live recording of the premier which took place at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus of Athens in 1961. The sound is very good. Teresa Stratas is exceptional. John Modenos, George Moutsios and Mihalis Heliotis are also first-rate. The Athens State Orchestra is mediocre.N. A. Peppas"
5,The seller is the senior author himself.,"In case you are like me and searched for this title on Amazon only to find that only used copies were available from a Marketplace seller ""rphiggins,"" you might want to know that the senior author of this text is also the seller. Seems obvious to you perhaps, but it wasn't to me.The delivery and processing of my order was fast and efficient. The text is exactly what I needed."
4,3 parts spooky and 1 part corny,"This CD has a great vibe with a big reverb, distant, jazzy creepy harmonies, easy-to-listen-to, early 60s atmosphere. There aren't any paint peelingly great lost pop songs, but it's a very pleasant listen that I will play again.Their greatest tune ""Hey Mama, You've Been On My Mind"" does not appear here (Dream Babes Volume 5), but if you dig that tune, this is worth exploring. Don't expect anything quite that heavenly, though."
5,High-quality heartache.,"I was going to write somethin flowery about this album to get you to buy it, but I really can't do it justice. It's a beautiful record full of moments that toe the line between steely and sentimental. Singer James Diers has an undeniable skill for blending pie-eyed observations and cliches in with dark witticisms to create lyrics that seem simultaneously innocent and wicked. While a true appreciation for the lyrics may be something that seeps in gradually, Dave King's ridiculous talent and creativity at the drums will be the immediate grab of this album. As always, the best pop and rock drummers are the jazz ones. His work behind the kit elevates this album above so many others. I can't really come up with a band to compare these guys to; I'll just say that if you like good hooks, great lyrics, and appreciate fantastic drumwork, buy this album."
2,Good in General,"During a substitute orientation class we used the substitute handbook for grades K - 12. I decided to buy the handbook for my own reference. Since I was going to substitute for high school only, I decided to buy the 9 - 12 version. Unfortunately the book was almost identical to the K- 12 version. As an example it suggested using puppets. I can't see using puppets with seniors. Having said that, there are general topics that are beneficial for preparing to be a substitute teacher."
1,Not the Crazy 8's,"This band is from Kansas City, not the old school ska guys from the norhtwest the Crazy 8's!"
1,This is NOT the Crazy 8's You're Looking For,"You want ""Law and Order, 20th Anniversary Release"" by the REAL jazz / reggae / pop / R&B; Kings: The Crazy 8's from Oregon.I don't really mean to disrespect THIS band (of the 'Brush Creek Blvd' CD), but it's just not my kind of music AND it's a BIG let-down if you're expecting the nuclear-powered funkin' energy of the ORIGINAL Crazy 8's."
3,The development of indoor air quality,"It is unusual for the authors of a book to warn prospective readers of their book, but my colleague Rick Diamond and I feel we must let potential readers know that this book, which lists us as authors, is a reprint of a report we did for the Electric Power Research Institute in 1984, and was republished last year without our knowledge. The publisher, University Press of the Pacific, states that they look for reports in the public domain that address timely subjects and offer them for sale to the public. While the information in the book is a useful summary of residential indoor air quality, it only covers the field up to 1984-a serious drawback for anyone looking for current information. So we suggest that unless you are interested in the historical aspects of this subject, you should consult more recent books.David Grimsrud"
5,Strategic Reads for the Year Ahead,"Interior Design Handbook of Professional Practice. Edited by Cindy Coleman; Published by McGraw-Hill and Interior Design Magazine. This book presents sensible new information and is indispensable to the libraries of all design firms. You'll especially enjoy the chapters on ""Growing A Profession,"" Intelligent Interiors"" and ""Information Technology."" This is more than a reference book-it's an inspriation."
2,Disappointed!,I thought I ordered the trolli brand but it ended up being from some organic company.... I was a little upset about that.... If you want to be sure your getting trolli gummy bears order directly from the company
2,Incontinence Briefs,I have not been able to wear them yet. They are too small for me. Even at the XLG size. I will be returning them.
2,sizes not normal,"the sizes were off, could not get them past knees. I ordered 2 sizes bigger than normal;i was not happy"
4,Excellent classical guitar work.,Anthony Glise performs beautifully and the selections from Brescianello are rendered beautifully on guitar. Only complaints: this cd is out of print and so commands a very high price. Also the recording quality is decent but not top notch.
2,"Not good for 1.25""","Not sure what went wrong, but this had incomplete and confusing instructions. I can normally figure things out, but even the bolts/nuts were all the wrong size. It was a 2"" unit with supposedly a couple of items that would make it a 1.25."" I didn't have time to goof around with it. As a 2"", I'm guessing it would be just fine."
3,"Works fine with some ""modifications""","Unlike the previous reviewer, my kit did come with all of the parts needed to work with a 1-1/4 inch receiver. Unfortunately, the width of the hitch bar was ~ 1.28 inches making it a little bit too big to fit in a 1.25 inch hole. After about a half hour with an angle grinder and a belt sander it now seems to fit fine (I wasn't going to send it back since it is so heavy and would be costly to return). With this ""modification"" it seems to fit fine."
2,What you see is not what you shall get.,"The one in the picture looks metal with a black rim. Should have read the description. This is why the drum seems like such a steal as I was thinking. It's the synthetic pvc type material with the rim being the same material with the same design, not black as in the picture. The Sound is o.k. however does not have the projection I thought it would have, and the coating makes it rather slick to hold. More of of kids toy if you ask me. So they are trying to take advantage of us when the drum is not what you see, shame on them for having a lousy product and trying to get rid of it as something better. Thats the name of the game for online shopping sometimes. However it is still so worth it. I'm looking into the Mother of Rhythm drums and Schalloch lines as I type here. Hopefully I'll have a nicer product this time. Hope you all find what your looking for. Never let the music die !!!"
3,rubber doll gets used a lot,Here is another good solid single from LOA. Rubber Doll is a pretty decent song to begine with. With a good number of good remixes(although a couple are a little to long)this is a must have for any LOA fan.
2,"Good ideas, but don't get the Kindle version","Pretty good book with some not-so-common sense about how to interact with people. As a non-salesperson being put in a salesperson role, I found Non-Manipulative Selling gave me ""permission"" to be a good guy, and just help people out. Something I could definitely get behind!Unfortunately the Kindle edition has unreadable graphics, and the charts were never inserted. Only a note ""GARY insert chart here"".Decent book, but you might get more out of the paper version."
2,badder than bad,"Im a Michelle Bauer fan and know she's got a lot of nasty's in his career.But Michelle Bauer & Horror-legend PAUL NASHY...How can I be wrong with this Item?REALLY WRONG!The Story of this movie is not so bad,but it looks like more than an D-PICTURE like an B-PICTURE!The werewolf-transformation of Paul Nashy is the worst in his career.And the playing of MichelleBauer isn't the best...Nothing for Horror-fans,maybe a look for trash-fans."
3,Where's the politics of water?,"Barich can write colorfully about California, no doubt about that, but he errs in including too much minutinae and not enough about California's most important issue: water. The politics of water must be central to ANY discussion of California. Southern California would not exist as we know it today without Northern California water. The movers and shakers in the water game are crucial for any understanding of 20th century California. Barich misses the boat, so to speak."
2,This is what is wrong with opera,"Lizzie Borden is a prime example of why I am not a big fan of opera; i use it as an example only because it is in English, so the flaws are not glossed over by the language difference. Lizzie Borden is essentially a play to which the composer added atonal underscoring. The entire score is one long recitative, with nary a coherent tone row. If a five year old made random stabs at a piece of sheet music and then put each word of the play to the approximate notes, you'd get this as a final product. There is no musical development, no emotional undertow, not even a poetic book; nothing which is the stuff of great opera (e.g. the works of Verdi, Puccini, etc.) If the performers were singing a capella you would think they were making it up as they went along. It is a symbol of the prime flaw in opera - especially modern, American opera (anything by Virgil Thompson is basically the same way.) It is grating and taxing to the ear."
1,The real truth?,"Real opera ceased to exist after Butterfly premiered. This isn't an opera; it's, at best, an oratorio. And even Porgy and Bess (and JC Superstar, and Tommy) isn't really an opera; it's a musical. Just because you call it an opera doesn't make it one."
5,Fruvous Rex!,"This is easily my favorite Fruvous album. Fantastic versions of great songs, including King of Spain done as a U2 song. Brilliant! Maybe not a good introductory album, but a MUST for any fan!"
4,live,"Moxy is a very fun band indeed. They are crowd pleasers, although this was one of the largest collection of homely young folks I've ever seen at a concert, folks more dungeon and dragons than a TMBG crowd. Just as long as it is dark and the music is pumping, who cares about the kids?"
5,Great job!,I must say this cd doesn't get annoying! Moxy Fruvous has such a wide variety of music that it doesn't bother you. It's very humorous and makes you want to tap your foot. I think this is an amazing cd!
2,How about something new boys!,"If you like the live shows, then this is a nice souvenir. However, it's just a live version of Bargainville with a few other tracks thrown in. Bargainville is what now, 5 years old and 3 albums ago?! Perhaps it's time to stop touring, spend a little time in studio, and reach the potential so many fans believe they have. Buy Bargainville and let's hope for something fresh in 1999. This one is 'been there, done that.'"
5,Raw History,"We all know the usual war stories, but this ""behind the scenes"" look informs us of what drives madman such as Hilter and his elite SS. A must have for anyone who believes that past history is important to the future. The movie was well done and actual footage is not as grainy as most history movies. This movie showed on the Military and Discovery channel, but was unavailable from their website. A very chilling and accurate account of Hilter's rise to power and subsequent decisions made during the war that were based on occult, mystic beliefs and astrology. It also shows the influence and power that Hilter's top military cronies had on Hilter. I highly recommend this movie."
5,Finest sound...,"As a fan of brass music, especially at Christmas, I've acquired cds by the Philadelphia, Canadian, Phillip Jones, Prince of Wales, and London Brass ensembles, all of which I enjoy. However, the Solid Brass album is in a class by itself sonically, revealing great detail in the instruments and a highly realistic sense of the space in which they're being played. The arrangements are excellent as well. A must for audiophiles who enjoy traditional Christmas music."
1,Seriously defective disk,"I'm afraid I can't recommend this disk, nor can I say what the music is like on this. Clearly, the CD is out of print, but you should exercise caution with this disk--as well as other CDs from the CRI imprint. I have purchased three copies (two new, one used) and all three will not play on any CD player or computer that I have tried. Given that I have similar problems with a second CRI recording, I believe the cause is a poorly mastered disk, although manufacturing problems or other difficulties may be at fault. Every copy of this disk I have tried has failed to play back on the last two tracks.It's a pity, given that Mr. Shapey's music is generally quite good and deserves better than this."
2,"Oh well, anyone can have a bad day","I've been exploring the music of Ralph Shapey in recent months. Until this recording, I'd been listening to chamber music and had generally been quite impressed. This CD of music for orchestra and voice with large ensembles was a considerable disappointment. It's hard to see how the composer of the marvelous violin music (recently recorded by Miranda CucksonMusic By Ralph Shapey) could be the same as the composer of this indulgent mess. All of the worst attributes of music of the 60's and 70's are on display here--chaotic jazz riffs, non-existent 'ritual' ceremonies, non-synchrony of events. The level of expression appears to be directly related to the loudness of the orchestra. The effect rapidly becomes tiresome and ever so dated. Quality of performance isn't an issue--some of the finest performers of the day were in front of the microphones. But it just wasn't worth the effort."
3,"Colorful, but...","This is a very colorful performance using a variety of stops. His articulation is sometimes delightfully surprising. His tempi are appropriate with one exception noted below.He skips repeats for some variations, which cost him a star. Others may not mind, but for me, this is a deal-breaker.At times he seems to play more quickly than he can handle, which cost him a star. For most variations, he maintains a consistent rhythmic pulse, but he seems to stutter while playing e.g. variations 5 and 14 at break-neck speeds.The only other performance I've heard on the organ isElena Barshai's, which I prefer to this one. While she is not as colorful in terms of timbre, I find her playing to be much more masterful. Also, she plays the repeats."
1,crackpot material,"This is crackpot material.Assis's theory, which assumes that time is absolute, violates a vast number of high-precision tests of special relativity.It is also inconsistent with cosmological expansion, and therefore requires the ""tired light"" hypothesis to hold. But tired light has been conclusively disproved in a number of different ways; for one example, see Blondin et al., ""Time Dilation in Type Ia Supernova Spectra at High Redshift,"" ApJ 682 (2008) 724."
5,My daughter loves it!,"I gave this to my daughter as a present and she absolutely loves it. She wasn't a baker but now she is. According to her, cakes bake evenly; heat gets distributed evenly. She and her husband can't thank me enough. It's money very well spent."
2,Bakeware by calphalon,Very surprised by this brand. I'm normally not back into the store to replace a Calphalon for many years. I am not happy with this gift set. Burns easily after a few uses.
4,Works like i expected it too..,"This is a good little fix for gamers on older mobos. Im on an old eMachines tower. Got this with the ""Better Together"" option with an x1600Pro 512mb. I had to replace my x1600 256mb when the fan crapped out and literaly flew off the gpu. So far its keeping my new gpu about 3 degrees cooler. Nice stream of air flows out of this thing.Only issue is that my expansion slots are below my agp slot. So this blower actually rests below my gpu.Its a cheap little cooling fan. But for people with major heat issues this might not be your best option."
3,not all that but ok,"don't be fooled by it's name, it's does not blow air out like a hair dryer, but it is usefull,i did not use it in a pci slot, instead i istalled it on the front of the PC on top of my hdds (did requier some modification to the PC case), works good and not too noisy!)"
4,Nice easy location,"This works to directly cool another card plugged in right next to it.It is a trifle loud but works really well.This fan does collect dust, VERY easily and quickly.Overall I love the fact I don't have to go hunting down some out of the way place to install this and that it does as advertised."
2,"Loud, then louder, and failed in under a year.","Worked ok when we first installed it, solid air flow, although rather loud. It did help the video card temp with about a 10 degree reduction. But the noise kept getting worse until it was really annoying especially on startup. It didn't get clogged with dust as I keep the machine and fans blown out; it was just the bearing wearing out. Purchased in Sep, 2010, totally dead in May 2011. Typical cheap crap. I'll be buying a more expensive one to replace it... hope the next one lasts longer."
2,good performance short lifetime,"I bought this product in December 2007 and it was working great, I used it for my video card, but after six months of use, it started to make a big noise due to dust accumulation, and the rpms reduced notably. It stopped working after seven months of use. I have a vantec PCI fan in other PC, and have been working for over two years and no problems.Tried to clean this fan, but it come in a sealed case, so it is not possible. Really did not like this product. Really short lifetime."
5,Worked great for 6 years,"This is the 2nd time I have bought this product, as the first I had purchased finally went out after almost 6 years of non-stop running. For only 10-15 bucks, it was still quite a deal and lasted a good long time in a slightly dusty environment(even with ill-regular/monthly cleanings)."
3,"Somewhat noisy, but works.","Installation is a breeze (pun intended). Remove a free expansion slot, and install it. Mine is beneath my Video Card so it pulls hot air from it and takes it outside case.It lowered my video card temps from at idle by 2 C. Lowered load temps while playing games by 4 C.It is on the noisy side thats why just 3 stars. I have 2x 80mm fans plus a 92mm CPU fan and this fan is easily the loudest. Not unbearable but noticable. I only use it in when expecting system to be under a load for extended period of time.The price was right for 10 bucks with free shipping, so for me even with the added noise, it was worth it."
3,Dell Inspiron 531 Desktop Needs Alernate Power Supply for This,"Bought this for my 2007 Dell Inspiron 531 Desktop. Unfortunately it DOES NOT HAVE MOLEX CONNECTORS. Not anywhere. However, you can buy a better Power Supply with all the right plugs, or get a 7 Pin Sata to Molex connector if you don't want to spend the $$. If you want to do anything extra with a Dell plan on purchasing a new Power Supply!"
3,"meh, its alright","its cheap, moves a decent amount of air,but no matter what slot i place it in,doesnt seem to change temps more than 1 deg C"
3,Average fan.,"It isn't the best fan out there, it won't give you a noticeable gain either. If you for some reason need a degree or two drop in temps, then this would be ideal, otherwise go with case fans."
5,"amazing performance, easy installation, not too pricey","This thing works insane, in my case it moves an impressive amount of warm air away from my GPU, easy to set up and hide cables. I recommend for any full tower enthusiast."
1,It didn't work,It seemed like it would be perfect for what i wanted. However it didn't work right out of the package. It made a quarter spin then died. It would not move again after that.
1,CANN YOOU HEEARR ME???,"Unless you have a psu with dedicated ""FAN ONLY"" molex connections so as to control this fan's speed OR an external fan speed controller it will sound like an old Eureka vacum cleaner! Many online have posted this fan did not last that long...it runs @ very HIGH rpm w/o some type of speed control, which will reduce its lifespan. I have this fan mounted next to a HIS iSilence5 Radeon HD 6670 graphics card (EGGcellent deal on it) using a Zalman fan speed controller. On low speed setting it is quiet moving fair amount of air and my peak graphics card temp under a heavy 3-d graphical load has been 37C*Pros:1- Works great mounted next to a passively cooled HIS iSilence5 graphics card (fan is perfect lenght)Cons:1- W/O fan speed control it will be LOUD and burn out quick2- Like to see a 3 pin connector3- Should include mounting screwI gave it one star, since w/o speed control it is LOUD and I had to fabricate a 3 pin connection to use this fan with Zalman fan speed controller."
5,"Great product, Great Price",I bought this product with fear for the price and the picture shows. But I received a quality product. I would recommend to any friend.
4,Great exhaust fan,"I installed this not right under my card, but one slot below that since it gives the air some time to leave the GPU and enter the Antec fan. I'm not getting the best cooling right now since my front case fan isn't up to par, so make sure that is in order before expecting to see huge results. Realistically, I only see about 2 degrees difference @ idle, have not tried under a load yet, I'll update when I get a better front case fan."
1,Is it a jet flying over my house?,Nope its my PC turning on. This thing is LOUD. I purchased this to get a little more air movement in my home theater PC which it does a fine job at. However I can hear my PC running from upstairs which makes it a really poor option for HTPC. This item needs to have some form of speed controller built in.
2,"Noisy, but efficient.","It blows air, and quite a bit of it... but the plastic housing that holds the fan disconnects from the PCI slot cover very easily, and actually starts to vibrate and make a lot of noise within a couple of weeks. Wouldn't buy again honestly."
2,Cheaply made and poorly designed.,"This was poorly designed and manufactured. It felt like it would fall apart in my hands.I give it 3 stars because it functioned as well as it would (with the design they chose). However I deducted 1 star for how fragile it is.Installed it on a new system build just for fun under an ASUS 560 card. It didn't even drop my idle temp by 1C.This may help if you have a GPU with no fan attached, but don't bother if you have a card that is halfway decent."
4,satisfecho con mi producto,"estoy muy contento con la compra de mi producto, al principio tenia la duda de que si era mas un lujo que una utilidad, pero en realidad si es un elemento util."
2,Uh....*cough*,I was looking at this and i was like...WOW this looks very promising.It doesnt work...I Don't know how to get it to work..but it just doesnt push any air threw. I thought when you stuck your hand up to the fan it would suck your hand in...But literally it sucks no air... it pushed ALOt of air out of the vent....but its cold air actually generated from the fan>.<
4,Works good.,"I put this under my GTS 250 1gb video card. I notice that it pulls alot of hot air out of my case and that gives me a sense of peace while my pc is in use. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because if its design. Perhaps it could be more sleek, or not as clunky looking. It does feel a bit cheap but it works really well. For the price i paid for it, it was worth the buy. It keeps my whole case free of excess hot air."
3,Pushes air at the cost of noise,"Hook this up to a fan controller because you will not want to run this for very long with the amount of noise it makes.Moves a decent amount of air, which is a bit deceptive for its size.Product can be flipped upside depending on where you want this to go in your case (some cases have open slots at the top, not just PCI slots)."
2,Looking for quiet fan... NOT!!!!,"I bought this fan to cool my videocard! It works decent, it lower my videocard temperature for near 8 Celsius at full load but the problem is the NOISE!!! Is perfectly the same as the Dustbuster you got at home. If you need some fan and don't have any other space to put it than one of the rear slots on your case, you should bought it with this switch Molex 4 Pin On/Off Power Switch 12V DC, that way you can turn it on when you need cooling flow like in videogames, BluRay movies, Photoshop, Autocad, etc.But if you are looking for a quiet fan!!! Let me tell you this is NOT the place!"
3,good case fan,does a nice job of pulling the heat of a RAID contoller card I am using that creates a lot of heat and has no fan on its heat sink. Immediately when i turned my system on you could feel the heat coming out the rear of the fan and its not that loud. Over all a nice addition to your PC if your needed to move some heat out of the case
2,Noisy Blower,"After about 3 weeks of operation, the fan clicks and buzzes like crazy. Looking for a better option."
2,It works,It works but... It does not move as much air as I thought it would. I wish every type of fan included CFM's in their information. It is usable and does what it should but I do not use it anymore...
1,"Finally, one that works","Most slot fans aren't ""worth a bucket of warm pi**""This one is. I ungraded my video card to a GeForce GTX470. That sucker puts out some serious heat and my HP Pavillion case had no room for another case fan. Enter the Antec slot fan. Its quiet (quiet enough) and does cool down my system.11/2011 Update: Downgraded by review. Fan grew increasingly noisy and died recently. Had to yank it out and put in a new one, same brand. Guess what? Started making noise after two weeks. Returned it and won't try another."
3,Not something you need in the case.,"Bought it on a whim, quite a powerful unit, but did not receive the unit advertised, kinda a bummer. Sucks hot air from the case and shoots it out the back, small fan, makes it lacking."
4,Not to bad for the price,Well took my fans 4 all togather so they blow into the case and stuck Antec Cyclone Blower towards the bottom of the case to draw out the air. It droped my my temps 6 to 8 degrees doing so.
5,Fixed all my computer hanging problems!,"Given the hot Los Angeles weather recently, my computer was heating up at well over 60C and my passive sink GPU was going over 67C! I had freezing problems, the computer would have trouble starting up after sleeping and sometimes it wouldn't even start Windows. After installing this fan right below my GPU it was like a miracle. I checked SpeedFan and my system maintained max 55C after leaving it on hot weather for 2 hours and my GPU maintains at 53C. All my freezing, hanging, restart problems went away. It was like night and day! Thanks Antec!"
4,Missouri Complete,"I have quite a collection of regional geologies. This volume is, by far, the best organized and complete one I've seen. If you have any interest in the geology of Missouri or the mid-continent area, I'd strongly recommend it."
2,Not very good,"My edition of the book was published under the name ""Parakeets,"" but it was originally titled ""Australian Shell Parrakeets.""The information in the book is pretty good, with an unusual amount of space devoted to the history of parakeets and the way in which the different color patterns are perceived by true parakeet aficianados. But there is also plenty of information on the care and feeding of your bird.However, I can't recommend the book because some of the information has become outdated, and also the layout throughout the book is poorly done. There is a feeling of inconsistency that is furthered by the juxtaposition of color photos with black and white, and oddly typeset blocks of text.If you're getting a parakeet for the first time, I would get a more mainstream beginner's book."
2,Not made well,"I have the entire Paper Dolls set and love most of it. I was very disapointed in the mobile. It is not made well, and does not fit our crib. We had to rig it to stay in place. It only seems to fit the ""traditional"" cribs. Ours is one of the sleigh style that converts to a toddler bed. For the price, it needs a lot of work."
1,Does not fit all cribs,"Very cheap flimsy construction.Badly designed.Only fits a limited amount of cribs, unfortunately not ours.Tune plays for 20 seconds max before needing to be re-wound.Not something you'd expect from an item costing $39.99"
5,Not for the meek,"Okay, so you probably saw the Hellsing TV series (I own it myself, and it's good), so you'll possible expect that the OVA series is just as good. I've got news for you... it's BETTER than the TV series. The OVA is clearly faithful to Kohta Hirano's manga, to the depictions of the characters (they really amped-up Seras Victoria, making her more agressive, and there's a little more detail about Paladin Alexander Anderson), to the humor, which was missing from the TV series.A word of warning: The OVA series is more violent and bloodier than the TV series, which makes this not a family-type anime. Make sure the kids are in bed before seeing this... if you have any kids, that is."
3,Not as good as the orinal TV series.,"This OVA tries to follow the manga, but just ends up looking extremely cheesy. Almost everything is overacted, and does not look believable at all. I wish they made it more serious like the first TV series. For the most part, the story feels really compressed, and compared to the original series, they just show all the action, but none of the psychological drama. As always, the manga is much better, so if you haven't read it yet, do so."
4,Trying to be grand..,"is not the same as being grand. The first Anime, made for TV, had great music, characters and artwork. The only failure was the plot - as the manga was not near the completion the anime had to go out and make its own ending.Now the manga is almost complete and this anime plans to follow the plot. But the artwork sometimes seems wooden, the music is no where near as good and some lines are just not needed. Why would Sir Hellsing call Arucard a ""count""? Why hit us over the head with that fact? If you are a fan you know who Arucard is and if you are not, well, thanks a lot for giving it away!At 50 minutes a DVD there will have to be 9 or 10 DVDs just to cover the basic plot. No extras but some trailers. Sad. Not worth the money. Buy used."
5,Psalm of Darkness,"With smoother animation, more action and the original English voice cast, Hellsing Ultimate Vol. 1 is worth buying, particularly if you enjoyed the first anime series. The OVA is far superior to the original series in every possible way (I like the new soundtrack though others don't) so if you're even remotely interested in the world of Hellsing then I can highly recommend this DVD."
4,A worthy follow-up,"HEllsing Ultimate gives the author Kouta Hirano another chance to unleash Hellsing upon the public, and it works. The animation quality is amazing, but the blood is kinda strange looking. The music is ok, but i prefer the music from the origional, and all the same voice actors are here japanese and english (except for the japanese Anderson.) You could only hope for more at 45 minuits, but the price is worth the figure, box, content, and extra features you get."
4,just the right size,This is just what I was looking for. It's a little bulky for my cabinets but I like the way it looks on the table.
3,"Actually, it works just fine in Vista","It works just fine in Vista, contrary to what I read here and in other places on the Internet. Installing the drive under Vista wasn't as straightforward as it might have been though. Here's how I did it: plug the Creative VF-0040 Webcam Instant into your PC. Vista will ask you to search the Internet for drivers -- let it do this. It'll search for a while and finally end up asking you to put the driver CD in the drive. Do this too. After that, you should get a message saying that the driver was successfully installed.I've tested it in the Creative WebCam Center application and in Skype -- worked fine in both places.I can't say much else about the WebCam because I did all of this for a friend, but it hopefully clears up the misconception that it does not work under Vista."
4,A great read for civil war buffs and military historians alike.,"I wholeheartedly recommend this book, not only for its historical value, but also because it entertains and educates the reader on the daily trials and tribulations of a member of the American military. Glazier's account of his enlistment and later commissioning serve to provide the modern military scholar with a meaningful narrative of expectation, experience, and finally, reflection. As a military officer, I would definitely recommend this book to any current, past or future service members."
4,A Song of David: Music to my heart,"I own and enjoy several other CDs of Sephardic music, but this one is my favorite. The melodies are poignant, lively and celebratory. I don't speak Spanish, but to listen and suddenly hear familiar Hebrew phrases and words emerge makes me feel connected to the Jewish communities that flourished in Spain a thousand years ago.My only complaint is that the lyrics as sung don't always match with the lyrics as printed. Syllables and letters seem to be missing from the printed version."
5,"Progressive-tech, wonderful!","Ben Watt has seriously changed his sound from the Lazy Dog Days. His current sound is like mellow, emotive, techno. This is no jumper, it takes a while to get going and never is that slammin', but is fantastic in an equal manner. I just recently saw Ben at the club and his set was similar to this mix. It's funny, on the CD, his sound is mellow; at the club, people were going nuts and dancing like crazy! Get this CD if you enjoy house/techno saturated with melody."
2,Redundant,I enjoyed Ben Watts Buzzin Fly I & II but not this one so much. It sounds too similar throughout. I just went to iTunes and downloaded the one track that I really liked. IMO 'Long Shadows' pretty much sums up the entire vibe of the CD.
1,Buyer Beware!,"This TV looks good on paper, but watch out if you have a problem! Ours developed severe problems after a few hours- two large sections of the screen were broken. Of course, no company or product is always 100% perfect, but our attempt to get this repaired or replaced has been immensely frustrating. They're telling me it will be at least a month before we'll have the TV back fixed, and after nearly a half-dozen calls to customer support, they want us to go through a week-long process of bureaucratic paperwork just to get the case escalated. This is now how Panasonic should treat customers that have just spent $2,000+ on one of their products."
5,A great TV,"I am so happy with my TV because the picture is the best without HD, and when you add HD you will not believe how good it looks"
4,Excellent!,Waited 2 yrs. to find the right HD TV. Excellent product. No problems Great picture No pip but who needs one. worth the money
1,Beware Panasonic,I bought a Panasonic plasma 2 years ago and it died for no reason. It will now cost $2000 for the board just to fix it. The TV repairman said he has never seen such a high cost for a replacement board. Multiple different board tried without luck. Still waiting.
1,Squandered potential,"As I have more important things to do like re-arranging my belly lint collection, I shall keep this one short. This opened with some decent zombie carnage then it quickly went all downhill. What we have is a convoluted mess of 3 tales that take place during the zombie apocalypse. In the final analysis the zombies play a minor role, thus leaving one to grapple with these stupid sub plots, two of which arguably don't even belong in the film. Although not the worst ""Z"" flick out there, it still wallows in a cesspool of mediocrity. Of interest only for the keep case art and those glorious opening scenes of zombie carnage, which were ""splat"" on."
2,Pretty Pathethic Zombie Movie,The best part about this DVD is the cover art. After reading some reviews where people talked the movie up it's B grade at its best. Looks like it was shot using a handy cam and very B grade acting. No new takes on anything.Basically involves a few interwoven stories of groups of people hiding and trying to survive with a zombie epidemic.A couple of scenes worth watching for the slice and dice but a big let down story wise. Personally I'd rent it - you wouldn't watch it more than once.
1,Cover art good and nothing else.,"I read the reviews so I expected garbage and that's what I got. Hollywood Video was closing and I got it cheap, but even a couple dollars is too much. Don't let the cover art fool you-REALLY! The movie really is as crappy as everyone else says. No plot point was resolved satisfactorily. Why they tried to bring vampires into this, well, in capable hands that might have actually been interesting to mix the genres... but NOT here. We've got zombies, vampires, and the antichrist (who's a young black boy) in this movie, everything except entertainment. In some low budget films there might even be some redeeming nudity, but again, NOT here. I don't mind low budget, but this was just awful."
1,Not Half as Good as the DVD Cover Art,"I like independent and low-budget movies. But they don't have to be boring, and this low-budget, independent movie, despite some early promise, was boring. It just didn't go anywhere. I'm giving it one star for the ""dance with the dead"" scene, but it's not worth watching just for that. This is one zombie you're better off avoiding."
1,And the point of this was?????,"I understand that some directors out there will take risk and put out some stuff in attemtps to be original. But original is not always good. And if someone claims this film is good because of originalty alone then i just gotta say that person is very shallow. This movie is three very bad stories and nothing more than that. i careless about great special effects, because Avatar ain't all that.. But anyways, this one is weak all around. No real zombie killing, the vampire s*** is stupid. This movie is just terrible. I'ma go wathc the original Day of the Dead for a great zombie flick."
1,Majorly Boring!,"I enjoy Zombie movies, but the best thing about this one is the DVD cover. This wasn't a low-budget movie, this was a no-budget movie! Almost the entire film takes place in two different houses, with occassional peeks out the window at zombies shuffling around. This film was a HUGE dissapointment; I ended up fast forwarding through the last two thirds of it hoping to find something enjoyable, but alas my efforts were wasted on this film. When it was over I threw it in the trash, regretting the fact that I spent $14.99 on this no-budget boredom."
5,Unbelievable value- this is a good deal for these two packages,"I did not actually know that this was available and had bought Photo Shop Elements and Premier Elements separately. With this available you save at least 50 bucks off the top.And, these are actually pretty integrated with each other. I have been doing photo editing for a while but never did video editing before. I found a lot of commonalities in the interface between the two, and you can send photos to Premier Elements with one menu item click, and put slideshows on DVD from Photo Shop Elements using Premier's DVD menus. So, a lot of back and forth that make this more than just two products thrown in the box. It is obvious that they built these together.Definitely a good value but more than that, this is almost like one product, not two, because there is one nice unified look."
4,The new Photoshop Elements 4.0,"The new version of Elements (4.0) does almost anything most normal people will want to do to photos. It is still replete with Photoshop's well known user hostility but, with patience, is a valuable tool to have. I do not like the requirement at the outset to decide what you will eventually do with the photo, but that is just an annoyance."
3,Not good for lots of clips,"I came back from vacation with hundreds of small mpg clips from Sony HDD camcorder, each averages about 40 seconds. PE2.0 crashes while loading about 100 clips. Called Support, they admited PE2 not able to handle this type of job and advised to get MPEG editor (more money, sigh). In addition I found:- very slow to load and rendering- Export funtion of MPG2 clips results in jerky mpg2 output"
1,"Beware, Premier 2.0 may require you to buy new hardware","Beware if you don't have a ""Intel Pentium 4, M, D, or Extreme Edition, or AMD Opteron or Athlon 64 processor(SSE2 support required)"" you won't be able to install Adobe Premiere 2.0 This point is not exactly obvious unless you read down into the middle of the system requirements. This is the first time that I've been upset by an Adobe product, and I haven't even been able to use it."
5,Great Organization!,"This product is wonderful for sorting your photos! You can assign multiple catagories to each photo for easy sorting. Very user friendly, lots of drag and drop features. Great editing built right in. You can create wonderful slide shows with music and captions. This is the best I have seen and used."
5,Best I've Found,I have used several other programs for DVD video and slideshow productions and this is the best of the bunch. It is dependable and preforms when asked. The many preset features with the effects tools makes this a easy program to use and enhance your production.
4,Premire Elements uses a lot of resources,"I purchased the package primarily to edit videos of youth football and figured why not get Photoship Elements while I was at it. I can easily burn video with the MyDVD software that came with the computer, but editing clips was difficult or impossible. My thoughts on Premire Elements is that 1) It can do a lot of stuff and has serious editing capabilities, you can cut and move clips around at will and overlay sound as you like, etc. 2) I did not find it particularly user friendly to learn at first and things that were easy on MyDVD are difficult to figure out, but once you figure it out it is not too bad 3) it uses a lot of computer resouces. For short clips it will do fine, but for clips of over 30 minutes it can take several hours to process/transcribe/burn the DVD. I have a gig of memory and an AMD 3500+ chip. It also uses more hard drive space than MyDVD."

5,Always reliable,I have several pieces of Chantal cookware because it offers even distribution of heat and easy clean-up. This piece is no different.
4,Easy to follow recipes = delicious low cal/low fat choices,"The author is an excellent chef at the Lake Austin Spa and Resort. In his cookbook, he details low fat/low cal recipes he has created and served to the patrons of the resort. He stresses the use of the freshest ingredients (having an extensive kitchen garden at the spa) to enhance the flavor of the dishes.

Includes tips on how to cut calorie and fat by, for example, making your own baked tortilla chips (super easy and tasty).Recipes have nutritional content on each. Take home message stressed to spa-goers at Lake Austin Spa and Resort is...portion size, portion size, portion size!"
1,Rubbish piece of kitchen equipment,This Chef'n Hightailer shrimp peeler and deveiner DOES NOT WORK!It tears the shrimp up and does not devein very well. I do not recommend it. I have sent mine back for a full refund after using it once.
1,A Waste of Money!,"I purchased this thinking it would ease the burden of skinning shrimp, however, it takes longer to use this then using your fingers. Don't waste your money on this."
3,"Yes, I like my Human Rare Please!","3 1/2 Stars = Very GoodGoofy semi spoof, semi serious offshoot of films like ""28 Days Later,"" with plenty of "" Re-animator"" overtones.A scientist invents a ""Rage"" virus that turn humans in to blood thirsty mutated Zombie like creatures. Not only does it work wonders of mass meaty mutilation from it's human infected, but infects giant vultures who (somewhat hilariously) swoop down from the sky & attack an RV filled with twenty something's. What ensues is a funny fearful fight for survival, as they become infected their self's, one by one.For you blood thirsty gory gore hounds out there, this is your main course of red rare meat by the piled plateful, quivering, shivering, glossy globs of gluttony gore . For the rest of you, just sit back & be bemused, & amused by the whole bloody spectacle!""Rage"" 2007[...]"
2,Not So Angry After ALL!!!,What can I say about this but what a disapointment. I fit where not for all the grusome effects and splatter this film would have received one star. I wont go into the plot because for one thing it was terrible not mention the acting was just as bad. I was not expecting top notch from this B-Movie but come on give something better than this. Like I said if where not for all the effects this movie would had been a total failure. I bought into the hype. Not that I was expecting top line from this movie but give me something to work with. I can only say if you want just gross effects and nothing else than this is what you will get.
5,"Pardon Me, My Brain's Exposed!...","If you are a fan of the more splattery film experience, then THE RAGE is the perfect pick! Filled w/ nearly non-stop gooshy action, including flesh-devouring, mutant maniacs! Axes, hammers, and screwdrivers stuck in various craniums! Mad science! Flocks of hideous, puppet / CGI turkey vultures! And a raving, raging Reggie Bannister (PHANTASM)! A secret serum turns normal, law abiding citizens into slobbering, gore-crazed insaniacs! This one's right up there w/ RE-ANIMATOR, UNDEAD, DEAD ALIVE, and other sloshing classics! Enjoy..."
1,Pathetic,"It's quite a challenge to describe just how bad this film is. And I don't mean bad in a good way, but bad as in dire, dismal, hopeless and pathetic. I see from other reviews that some people really do like it. Fair enough, each to their own and all that, but everything about this film leaves me bored. Very weak 'story', desperate acting, gormless script, unconvincing gore. I had no interest in the characters and would have happily seen them all nuked after 30 minutes of this dross. Sorry fans, but I think with a bit of effort, planning and a budget of 25 you could do better yourselves."
2,"2.5, not too impressed","Gore is a VERY important factor in making a zombie movie, don't get me wrong, but it's not the only thing that makes the movie. This movie kinda sucked. I was expecting much better and it kind of fell flat. The acting wasn't too good, the plot was stupid, and those birds, WTH??? FAKE as ever! They kind of reminded me of the vulture Eon from that Rudolph's Shiny New Year Special. LOL, claymation at it's best. I guess it had potential but lacked in the ability to go anywhere with it. Again, it delivered on the gore, but that's about it. BOOOOOO!"
2,Another typical low-budget slasher film.,"I'm generally not too fond of movies like this anyway. I only rented it because I wanted to see the music of Midnight Syndicate put to a movie. So, I'm pleased to have the soundtrack, but I can pass on this movie."
2,Erin Brown's worst performance,"Not professionally acted, but the effects were great. The Rage is a very gory film, almost as Gory as the Hostel films. All in all Erin Brown finally made a film, that she didn't have to get naked in."
4,A truly humane and generous view of the Palestine/Israel struggle,"This book was written by a Palestinian whose family initially were expelled from their home in 1948. It shows great generousity and humanity: the writer is not embittered but rather is willing to share the country, which he names ""Canaan"" after the ancient inhabitants of Palestine, thus by-passing the contentious terms of Palestine or Israel.When I read it, I felt this was precisely my own dream. I am a former Israeli (Jewish) citizen and would highly recommend this book to readers unfamiliar with the history of Zionism who would like to learn more about the bare facts.Equally I would highly recommend it to Zionists who are not completely brainwashed and are willing at least to listen to different views.The book should also be part of 6th form students' curriculum or at least available in any college library."
1,Unscientific Nonsense,"Qumsiyeh is a biologist by training. He is supposedly an expert in genetics. Nevertheless, in this book he promotes the theory that Jews of European descent are not related to other Jews, but are descended from converts of the Khazar tribe. True experts have investigated this theory from every possible angle, and found, for example, that European and Middle Eastern Jews have a common genetic origin, especially on the male side, and that Yiddish (the language spoken by European Jews in the past) shows no sign of Turkic (Khazar) influence. If you can't trust Qumsiyeh on an issue supposedly within his expertise when it conflicts with his political agenda, what can you trust?"
2,Unfortunately the cure did not work for me,"I've been an acne sufferer since I was 13 years old, and have been on every antibiotic, tried every topical medication in combination with those antibiotics, and have been on 3 courses of Accutane in the last 8 years. My acne has never been extremely severe...but it has been quite resistant to most treatments. I was really excited when I bought this book and read the reviews, it sounded like it might really be the cure I'd been searching for all these years. The plan was a lot of work, especially at night with the ice packs, but I was willing to try anything. I followed the plan exactly as stated for 6 full weeks with little to no improvement. That was my experience."
5,EXCELLENT,"At first, I tried all the suggested products on the same day... bad decision... very harsh! HOWEVER, after my skin, which became irritated calmed down, I took a different approach. The book suggests doing things a little different order if the Benzoyl Peroxide was too rough.Results: Fabulous! Try adding each product slowly. The book is excellent resource on acne, explaining explicit steps in how acne occurs and why the regimen works. Over the counter products, easy steps and beautiful results. Thanks, Dr. Dubrow!"
2,"Interesting information, but it didn't work for me","I found the information in this book enlightening, so I went out and bought the required products (vitamin A, alpha lipoic acid, vitamin c ester, oral and topical) and embarked on a low glycemic diet. I used the products for about two weeks and broke out with what amounted to probably 20 small zits around my nose and mouth. As soon as I stopped with the products and went back to my usual benzoyl peroxide regimen my skin cleared back up nicely.To be fair, I think it is hard to follow the routine he recommends and finding the right products is both difficult and expensive, so perhaps I did not do everything exactly right, or get just the right products, but I did not expect my skin to get worse."
4,antioxidant moisturizer,"First I will say I am a 26 year old woman, I've been on DrDubrows acne cure programme for 8 weeks, and while my acne has lessened it hasn't completely gone yet.After a long, exhaustive search I found an antioxidant moisturizer that contains tocotrienol, vitamin c ester and alpha lipoic acid. Nutribiotics make an oil-free hydrating facial mist that contain all these ingredients (plus others), it is relatively inexpensive, can be purchased through amazon, and can be shipped worldwide."
2,"High hopes, but Acne Cure didn't live up to them","After 15 years, I stopped taking birth control and my face revolted in constant acne breakouts. I tried 'the cure' and after just a few days my face did start to clear up. But it was short lived. Now, after 6 weeks on the program my acne is back full force. After a high hopes and a good start, I'm really disappointed."
3,Only one day - but no more picking,"The first time I've EVER read something about acne that could get me to stop picking, squeezing and popping my zits. I used to feel like I had an addiction to squeezing. I couldn't stop picking no matter what! It would be the first thing I'd do in the morning and when i got home from work and before I'd go to bed....really sick and not good for preventing scarring. This book explains in detail what acne is, how it's formed and what exactly is happening when you pick at them and how the disease and bacteria is spread by that process. Even if the regimen doesn't work (which I'll post about later after I've completed it), I will NEVER pop or squeeze another zit...It's like when they show pictures of dirty lungs and people quit smoking. Keeping my fingers crossed that this regimen works!"
2,"Not a ""Cure"" for Acne","This book has a very good topical treatment for Acne. But the root cause of the condition is internal. I tried this books protocol for 3 months with limited success. I followed it meticulously. But I finally cured my acne with dietary change and lots of cleansing now months after giving up on this book and trying a different approach. I am now 100% acne free and no longer use topical treatment. If I had an occasional pimple however, I would follow the protocol listed in this book because I have never seen a more effective topical protocol. The website I found that got me on the right track was [...] if you want to check it out. It helped me completely. Good luck to all!"
5,"Finally, a progam that makes sense","No wonder I've had little long term success in treating my acne with just a product like OXY. It's all about attacking ALL the sources of acne as Dubrow explains in easy to understand language. The synergy of his program makes perfect sense. I was wondering why I hadn't read about such a program before. Then I realized that Dubrow is a board certified plastic surgeon, and not a dermatologist. If he were, he certainly wouldn't want to cut off his pimples to spite his face."
1,Didn't work for me,"Book promises -the end- of acne problems, even severe acne cases, I followed carefully and did not work for me.The ""solution of acne problems"" proposed by this book are three basic procedures which are:Salicilic acid based soap, Glycolic acid, and Benzoil peroxide products. And some tips -like use ice on affected areas- to avoid pimples inflamationall this in the first and second chaptersThe rest of the book is dedicated on how to keep a healty skin(using minerals like zinc, antioxidants, and other things we know)My advice is: save your time and your money"
1,Not great methods,"The best book for Acne that one should get is ""Clear Skin"" by Dan Kern. That will clear up your face using simple techniques. it has been working for me, and it will work for you. Don't bother with expensive proactiv, just try the methods in ""Clear Skin"" and you will save a lot of money. Thanks again to Dan, for his methods. I hope that more people know about this"
2,buyer beware!,"Don't get false hope people! This is not a cure! All this book talks about is Salicylic Acid, Benzoyl Peroxide, Cold Compresses, Retin A, etc STUFF WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT!"
2,Daniel O'Donnell : My Story,"Daniel O'Donnell : My StoryThis book was bought as a gift. Soft back and was supposed to be new. The cover was bent, and the pages were turning yellow. It also had a black slash on the top of the pages, like you see in the bargin book bin. I have a long history with Amazon and this is the second Daniel O'Donnell product I have purchaced that has been way under par."
2,Agree with Spence The Elder,I'm just supporting what was already well stated by Spence The Elder.I'm glad I only borrowed this title from the library and didn't purchase it.
2,Didn't last long,These bulbs were advertised to last 5000 hours. Two of the three burned out within 9 months or an estimated 2000 hours.
1,amazon purchase,"Poor quality, expensive for the product, blurry pages, many not legible, dissappointed; the photo copies could have been better if more time was taken."
4,Weber3351001,"In today's economy, I don't believe it is necessary nor wise topay the suggested retail price. Any and all gas grills, with thetechnology we have today, should stay well below 400.00. That isthe only reason it was not given a 5 star. People expect to purchase a new grill every 5 years even if that means purchasing protection from the outside elements to cover."
3,Crime of Magnitude - Mediocre rendition,"Eighty years later, Mark Lemberger is out to vindicate his paternal grandfather, thought by some to have assaulted and killed his 7 year old daughter, Annie Lemberger, who would have been the author's aunt. The book is thoroughly researched and the reproduction of contemporaneous newspaper coverage throughout the text is interesting. Possibly to avoid allegations of familial bias, Mark goes on and on and on. I got bogged down and put it down."
3,On your hands...,Hmmm.......I've had a Leatherman for almost 10 years now. I bought this to give as a present. I decided to NOT give it as a present. Simply because of the fact that the black paint comes off onto your hands.Plus the general quality of the Knife seemed lower to me.
3,Ok,I dunno. I thought Leatherman was supposed to make good products. It is difficult to open and I've pinched myself. Might just donate it to a homeless person.
4,Getting Started with RFID,"""It was a great book! It explains what goes into an RFID printer to make it ready for today's carton-labelling mandates. It creates appreciation for the technology and it really helps to jumpstart your compliance team. The general RFID 101 information was very useful in educating other people within my Company."""
3,a good LF and HF testing tool recomendation,"For those who need faster ""diving"" in RFID technology I would recommend to take a look at DataBrokers TagTracker (databrokers.net). Their new version of the software works with LF and HF transponders and uses Hibernate to store scanned data in a database. It comes with PIRF-Lite (Java written API) which allows the user to make new transponder layouts and interact with the RFID reader differently than it is shown in TagTracker. TagTracker itself is enough to collect RFID data from different locations (RFID readers) and store it in a common database. Like a data pump. All you need is to create your own interface to query the database using your preferred languages/tools , etc."
5,Simon Soars,"I've been a fan of Jon Simon's music for 3 years or so, own 6-7 of his CDs. Love the Judaica. But Soar? Holey-moley, this is something else. Phenomenal. If you love Pat Metheny, definitely check out Simon's new CD. My two favorite cuts are ""With the Wind"" and ""Soar"", but ""City Groove"" is mighty sweet, too.Treat yourself right. Buy this CD!"
5,More then what you pay for...,"The 1-star review from ""BarB"" below, should not apply. They clearly didn't read about what they were buying. These tiles are exactly what is advertised and for the price, they work extremely well. I'm about a month in to them and the floor looks outstanding. Easy installation, easy to cut, completely satisfied.I can't emphasize the price enough. You easily get much more than what you pay for so for that, I'd give them a good rating. As for the wear, time will tell. I'm looking for a 1-2 year fix so I can't imagine I'll be disappointed."
1,item not as pictured,From the picture one would assume a 12 inch tile with 3 inch squares. NOT THE CASE. It is like the other checkerboards with 6 inch squares. This is misleading. I am not happy.
3,Everything and the Kitchen Sink,"Bent's Programmed to Love is a leisurely sound collage, equal parts Air, Roni Size / Reprazent, and any manic DJ/Remixer you care to mention. The duo of Simon Mills and Neil Tolliday are of the everything-and-the-kitchen-sink school, and for most of Programmed to Love, this works in their favor. The kitschy opening samba ""Exercise"" moves from its loungecore origins to the dreamy ""Private Road Laughing Gear"". ""Cylons in Love"" marries Kraftwerk to Dido. ""Swollen"" is Air fronted by the Cocteau Twins. Etc. The songs are all too long by minutes (what is it with these ambient dance bands?), but good company nonetheless. ..."
5,Extraordinary,"This CD and its companion CD of Brahms piano music, is, flat out, the finest collection of these utterly remarkable works. The piano music of Brahms possesses incredible subtlty and nuance and no performer brings these out as beautifully and poetically as does Kubalek. If you love this music THIS is THE CD to buy."
3,every body needs a friend,I think the author did a good job at describing what a friend is for.The story is good for little kids because it may teach them that they need to share or when you when you need something done no one will help you. I think the pitchures book are colorful and cheerful.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!,"1) The Visor doesn't even fit in the cradle.2) It isn't even a full cradle. There's no ""back support,"" so even if you could get it to fit, it would fall over and fall out.3) My computer didn't even recognize it as a USB device."
4,A sensible anthology,"A collection of eulogies, as the title implies, along with some letters and writings on death and grief. It is a curious fact that, as shown here, the most unlikely people can be eloquent in the face of death. Many of the eulogies here quoted are beautiful and moving not for the sake of the dead but for the power of the language used to carry them back to the hearers' and readers' memories. Especially noteworthy are Atatürk's memorial to soldiers ~ both Allies and Central Powers ~ who died at Gallipoli in W.W.I, Richard Selzer on his mother, Neru on Ghandi ~ more than can be listed. Not at all the morbid book one might think this would be; it is, in fact, more a celebration of the possibilities of life than a mourning about death."
1,WRONG ITEM SHIPPED,"Consumers please be warned, you don't get what you ordered on this picture, I ordered what is shown on the picture and all I received was the top part of the image, which is not what I wanted, they are not detailed in describing what will be shipped, therefore, you are lead to believe you will get the entire top cover, top and back. I called AutoPartsWay, and they told me that the item purchased is not specified properly by Amazon on the website, and I needed to tell Amazon that I needed both items, however, based on the picture Amazon posted, I am being shown that I will receive the top and the back part, when I called AutoPartsWay, they did not have the back piece nor did they know what it was and where I can get it.....this is truly frustruating, as I have been lead to believe I'm getting the full cover and did not. This order is being returned for a full refund......RMD"
2,Construction Marketing,"Basically, I feel cheated. I advise others desiring detailed information on construction industry marketing not to waste your money. Unless you are a complete novice you will not gain any useful insite from the book."
2,Earth the New Frontier - Not worth the read,"The first part of the book was good in the typical ""doomer"" fashion. But the rest of the book was all chase scenes between the bad guys and the good guys. I stuck it out to the end hoping to read about the survivors and maybe a description of their new life at their destination, but it was a real letdown with just a short page of the end of the journey."
5,I liked this book,"When my boyfriend first gave me this book to read on the airplane, I didn't want to read it because it wasn't my genre, but I just have to have something to read when I fly so I read it.I have to say, this book really surprised me. The villains were scary, I cheered for the heroes, and I felt bad for the ones who didn't make it. The story transfixed me so much that when I got to the motel room I had to finish the book before I went out sight-seeing."
3,"Earth, the New Frontier","I really enjoyed the story overall. It has a little too much bad language to be read by children but if adults will read it with a ""bleep"" on the offending words, I think they will enjoy it. The plot is quite plausible."
3,It wasn't bad,"I liked it. Rough editing, typos, definately a first book, but still I liked it. The people, the scenery, the pace. I'd read a trilogy if it were longer."
4,Pretty good,"I liked this book and thought it was pretty good. The writing was a little rough in the opening scenes, but the characters developed and the action kept my attention. There wasn't anything wrong with this book that some professional editing couldn't have fixed."
1,Not as described!,"The ""mounting rod"" as shown in the product description and image is NOT included. 2 sets of 4 separate mounting ""buttons"" and 1 set of 4 ""protective pads"" are provided, but there is no way to attach the 2 sides together... the ""rod"" which runs between the condensor fins is not in the package at all!This makes it impossible to actually mount anything!I double-checked the product model number (1989) and even asked for a replacement shipment... the same incomplete item arrived. It is useless without going out and purchasing a separate connecting piece to complete the mount... which is supposed to be part of the unit, and appears from the image to be an integral part of one side of the connecting rod.Waste of money."
5,i need more stars to rate this music!!!,This is my tnird cd that i buy from pedros music..and i will gping to get the whole collection....real and excellent music...thank pedro!!!!!
4,A beautiful snap shot,"I've been a fan of Pedro since I first heard him on Pat Metheny's album ""First Circle.""His voice was a stirring texture that complemented Metheny's composition. I was dispointed at his departure from the group, but change is inevitable and change is good.This CD by Aznar is a beautiful snap shot of where he was musically in 1998. Despite it's dated sound,it still has the magic. Aznar makes no apologies and refused to remaster this jem. Because of that it holds the essence of a fond memory of a time gone by. The compositions are rich in textures yet sparse in their presentation like a well planned meal; each course has a certain flavor, each tune has it's personality. Each tune unfolds as you linger through each track.I must admit I had higher expectations. Despite what I had hoped for, I was thoroughly enchanted by it. It's definitely one for your collection."
4,Great book!,My daughters are 7 and 8 and they love this book. It was a great story and something to keep in our home for a long time.
5,A great book for young kids!,"When I was little, this was one of my favorite books. I loved the way the one grain of rice would turn into over ten billion! Every kid from 1st-4th grade will love this! Its fun to read and a great math lesson! Hope you enjoy this sweet book!"
5,One grain of rice = many valuable lessons for students,"One Grain of RIce is not only a book of math, it is also a folktale. It shows how rice can grow from one grain, to two grains,to four grains, to 8 grains to 16 grains and all the way up to a whole barn full of grain.It also tells of how people were treated by the leaders of the country in which they lived. A very valuable lesson."
5,Tops in my Book,"This is one of those books you just can't put down once you start reading it. It takes you on a wonderful journey, gives very practical business advice, and just plain makes you feel good. Mr. Peterman has my highest admiration as a business person and a human being. You go Cowboy! We are all rooting for ya!"
5,He Pulled the Trigger and Rode the Bullett,"I knew it, I knew it, I knew it. My friends all assumed that Peterman Rides Again would be filled with chest-thumping bravado and blame-shifting excuses about why his company stumbled and fell. But I believed better of John.I was right.In the book, Peterman gives us a fascinating and unvarnished play-by-play of how ""one thing led to another.""You'll smile. You'll laugh. You'll shake your head in amazement and say, ""That sounds like something that I would have done."" My prediction is that you'll read it cover-to-cover in a single sitting. And when you finally lay it down, you'll feel encouraged and empowered and believe more deeply than ever that ""anything is possible.""Buy yourself a copy of this book and meet an upbeat and funny new friend.We haven't heard the last from John Peterman. Not by a long shot."
3,A little disappointing,"I was a customer of J. Peterman since 1990. His catalog was unique and very appealing, with very well done drawings and descriptions of items that were not available elsewhere. Silver plated cups from a railroad dining car grace my cabinet, and I still wear a very well made ""Kentucky"" jacket. The glove leather wallet is a treasure. J. Peterman's story is well written, but is lacking in his family history. There is only a very brief mention of his wife and daughter, even tho he had several children. The book is mostly about his travels around the world to buy objects for his store. There is a touch of (John) DeLorean in Peterman, while he travels around cancelling orders from his suppliers when things went bad, and his high placed executives are making plans to open Peterman stores around the country. His ""gentlemen rancher"" image does come across very well, and I admire Peterman for his high quality taste without being snobbish."
4,"Oddly fascinating, like Zen and the Art of Selling Dreams","Peterman always had an oddly likeable and sweet touch as a salesman, and it's more so in his book. For those who don't know the story of the rise and fall of J. Peterman Company, it was far more interesting than any silly stuff on ""Seinfeld."" Well written, interesting, and touching. One wants to sit down over a fine bottle of wine and just pick this man's brain and sense of humor and irony, which never fails him."
1,"Could Have Been, But Isn't","Like everyone who enjoyed the Peterman catalog, I thought it would be interesting to read about how it started and why it went broke.It wasn't."
2,Did somebody say pretentious?,...As nauseating and self-congratulatory as the catalogs used to be - only not as well written.
2,Melody is nearly inaudible,"Sure, this is nice, restful music and the harpist never falters. But if you would like to hear the lovely tunes, look elsewhere because the chordal accompaniment overwhelms the tinkly, distant melody lines. (And I'm listening on speakers with a too-forward treble range.) A performer, especially one going to the trouble of making a recording, should be aware of balance. Also a good audio engineer should assist with this matter.The recording is harp alone. Working with a sweet, gentle melody instrument would be another approach to the problem."
5,Superlative,"This is truly beautiful music on harps having more character than the modern concert harp. The melodies are attractive, with good counterpoint figures. Recorded sound is first-rate, without mush or harshness, although low-frequency noises from the recording venue may intrude during quiet passages if your equipment goes low with authority. I have bought several of these CD's - when I play them for friends and family, they ask me for the CD as a gift!"
4,The Enchanted Isles,beautiful harp music that I enjoy so much - she is very talented. CD arrived in perfect condition and very quickly.
3,One song is worth it,"The song ""Brian Boru's March"" makes this CD worth it, but other than that one song,the CD is very boring."
5,Andrographis,"Arrived on time in good shape: good price. Part of my ""cold cure"" that works very well."
3,"Excellent information, but...","This book gave some real and excellent information about the literal abundance of crap that is manufactured into our food. Unfortunately, after reading it, you are left wondering: What is left to eat if I avoid all of the foods that he talks about?Unlike the first reviewer, I was actually pleased that he didn't talk about trans fats, as that is a very obvious and well publicized ingredient in most foods. I wanted to know what was in my food that no one would talk about, and Allen Smith goes into great detail about ALL of these other things, including artificial colors, flavors, MSG, genetically modified foods, fortified foods and more. You'll be amazed at the number of chemicals that are routinely put into many foods, but you'll also be overwhelmed at the thought of elimininating so many of the foods that you currently eat. It just isn't possible. Good for information, but unrealistic for real life (except for those who need this info for health problems)."
3,"Good introduction, but little else","The Penguin Epics selection of Dante is rather ungenerous--a little over half of Inferno is reproduced here in the subpar but entertaining Sayers translation.This book includes the most famous sections of Inferno, which is only the first of the three canticles of Dante's Divine Comedy. How and why these sections were selected must remain a mystery, as there is no foreword or introduction to explain the selection process, only a brief note that will tell you nothing more than I have written here.There are no notes, which may pose a problem to anyone unfamiliar with Dante or the mythological and historical figures to which he repeatedly refers. If you are looking for a highly readable and complete edition of The Inferno, check out the Mark Musa and Anthony Esolen translations.Recommended as rainy day reading for anyone who already likes Dante."
1,RCA DRC 80 40N DVD Recorder,I spent considerable time installing this unit in my system..After several frustrating hours..trying to unlock the disc slot I discovered that the unit would not open.. Sent the unit back using the very efficient return system prpovidedby Amazon. Did NOT replace the unit
1,THIS IS A JUNK!!!,"I don't know if I only got a really bad apple, but this one is a JUNK!!! Amazon rips me off with this crap big time!! 30-day warranty is not enough for refurbished products for electronics. Sure, this junk operates OK during the 1st couple of weeks although showing some signs of hidden defects. But after the 30 day warranty lapsed, everything went berserk. I won't be surprised it this junk will explode one of this days!!! You wont buy this product even for a penny!!"
2,Worked great for a while,It cut and ran very nicely for a couple of sharpenings worth of work. But by then it had stretched so much that it no longer fit the bar on my Husqvarna 455 Rancher. Very disappointing because it cut well.
5,Any Hot Tuna Fan Would Love This!,"WOW! Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady tear it up on this! I love this video, not only for the classic songs performed on it, but also that it is at the legendary Fillmore. What an appropriate venue for these former Jefferson Airplane members! Jorma will mesmerize you with his intricate-yet-acessable playing, and Jack's relentless bass is sure to inspire any bass player! It inspires me even though I'm NOT a bass player! It almost makes me want to learn to play bass, just because Jack is SO amazing throughout! The same thing could be said about Jorma and his playing, however! Their rapport shines throughout this entire performance.If you like your Tuna hot, it doesn't get much hotter than this!"
3,"good, BUT","What happened to the BASS ? Jack's Bass should be jumpin, I barely notice it, even turning the bass boost on stereo. I have the old VHS version, was hoping if they put out a DVD they'd remix. nope.( and finish the last song instead of fadeout. 'course I don't know what's left of the original tapes, if anything.)"
5,from THE NATION magazine,"In Carroll's masterpiece, Sleeping in Flame, what begins as a brooding,witty and bittersweet novel--think Paul Auster or Haruki Murakami--about a film actor and his desire for the beautiful and androgynous Maris York, has,by its end, traversed a world of shamans and sea monsters in an astonishingreworking of the Grimm tale ""Rumpelstiltskin."""
4,Sleeping in Flame-good contemporary fantasy,"Was pleasantly surprized by this author, having read this I went scouting for more.He's a bit like Tim Powers, writing of the strange or the weird.So, if you are a fan of things that go on behind or below or where ever - I recommend him.p.s. - If this novel gets you interested try ""The Wooden Sea"" as your next Jonathan Carroll treat.Of the 4 books from Mr Caroll I've read it's my top pick."
5,Read this book again and again....,"The first time I was introduced to this book was by an English professor of mine in college. Ususual for most college level classes, the book list for the semester consisted of only three novels: Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Wuthering Heights, and this book. Read these novels together, they make for such an alluring and profound literary trio."
1,Programmers beware.,The program is full of holes and traps for the programmer. The new method of including the report in VB programs uses a lot of overhead and slows a VB program down if the number of reports is more then 4 or 5. Some necessary dependacy files are not included and it will not easly load onto computers not using the internet (a great many business computers). Crystal Software includes a 60 days support package that is not at all enough. Just visit the Crystal developer web site to view some of the problems. Save your money and use your older versions until they get it right.
1,died after 30 minutes,"My boss got me this item to record meetings, and while I was learning how to use it I discovered the following: Backlit display is almost impossible to see, it takes 15 seconds for it to tell you how much memory is left, there is no carry pouch as advertised on the box, the battery that came with it was dead, the loose USB plug cover will surely fall off soon, the neck strap is stiff and inflexible, the directions suffer greatly from translation, while I was recording the unit powered itself off never to come on again. Lived 30 minutes."
3,Get Over It Very Soon!!!,"The single released from Kate DeAraugo's first album ""A Place I've Never Been"" is a nice slow and pop sounding ballad. As the winner of Australian Idol, she is guaranteed a good start in the music industry, however the song ""Maybe Tonight"" went to no.1, it is a song that can only be listened to a few times, until it becomes almost too much to bear. It is a good first song, however, there are others on the cd that are much better and should have been a release single to begin her career. Although, kate DeAraugo has a good voice and i do not anticipate her to be the next ""fallen"" idol, as the fomer idol cAsey Donovan has been dubbed. A good cd, but gets old very quickly."
2,Typical Idol Fodder.,Number 1 here in Australia at the moment (not surprising). Not a bad pop / ballad song. Kates voice is pleasant enough to listen too but it just sounds like music by numbers. I realise being an Idol single thats what we are going to get but it lacks emoition and becomes rather tedeous after a couple of listens. Hopefully her full length CD will be a bit more exicting but with her CD only containing 10 tracks I doubt that it will be.
5,Linenspa 1200 Thread Count Sheets,The quality of the sheets is exceptional at a very reasonable price. The order was processed promptly and the service by the vendor was excellent. I highly recommend this product.
1,Too Many Mistakes for a Test Prep!!!,"I have only gotten through the first 2 logical reasoning practice tests (13 questions each) and have found 3 serious printing and explanation errors. It has become increasingly difficult to have faith in this book which is 'allegedly' going to help me achieve better results on what I consider THE MOST IMPORTANT TEST I WILL TAKE CONCERNING MY FUTURE--something I do not take lightly. When the validity of Kaplan's expertise in test preparation is so blatantly off track within the first 70 pages of this extensive book, I stongly recommend Princeton--that is where I am heading right now. Where are the editors? They should be ashamed."
4,"Richie,As Good As Ever","Richie,sounds as good as ever on his latest cd. The title says it all, Love songs! Quite a few of these will be considered for Wedding songs of Love! Great writing and vocals!"
5,very pleasantly surprised!,"Being a huge Buffalo Springfield fan, but a lukewarm richey furay fan,boy was i surprised! this is absolutely the best thing he has ever done. the remake of kind woman in superb!. if you like country rock with update sense, this is a can't miss cd. great hooks, great guest musicians, this cd has it all."
2,Appalling Misfire From A Great Organist,"When I first heard this I nicknamed it 'the vampire's Christmas'. Everything from the lowering drawing of the performer on the cover to the choice of materiel for the improvisations is misjudged . I had picked it up in a post-holiday sale bin. (Exactly where it belongs.)Guillou is one of the world's great organists, but that doesn't guarantee good taste or good sense.It represents one of the very few misfires for both performer and for the Dorian label.I can't imagine why anybody would want to listen to it for anything other than Guillou's improvisatory skills and extraordinary technique.Not the Christmas CD to curl up with with your family !Dorian (circa 1988) wins back some points for the excellent sound recording."
4,Spong technique looks at historical audience.,"By looking at the historical and literary purpose of the Gospels rather than forcing it into a Greco-Roman historical context, Spong sheds some insight into the spiritual and political, rather than historical, thrust of Christian Testament."
2,not a convincing discussion,"author obviously had done his research, however the claim to a a bishop who had experienced christianity first hand should be revised. the challenge of his belief could easily be defeated by any christian theologian. comments on biblical context were usually based on the author's mere assumptions.this book will definitely appeal to those looking for religious opinions that aren't biased towards atheism or christianity. however, the content is more skewed towards christian controversies."
1,THIS SUCKS!!!,The fact that this band exists is a travesty! There are talented musicians out there and this band didn't find any of them! Simply put... I've heard more melodic sounds from a deaf raccoon that was set on fire while being swung by the tail! How does a band like this exist? Too bad there isn't a negative star rating!! To call this crap music is an injustice!!!!
2,Dated and poor workmanship,"Ok, it's a pouch. The clear plastic window is fairly large especially if you have the new Razor2 with it's 2 inch outer screen. I also like the link that secures it to your belt if you're wearing jeans or something casual. I ordered a few other cases on e-bay the same day and my favorite was only 5 bucks and I like it much more than this pouch. Also the stitching on the Body Glove was just thrown together making it mis-shapen. Not worth the price. Wish I'd kept the box to return it."
1,Not a good fit for LG enV...,"This review only applies to the LG enV, and perhaps any phones of comparable size...I bought this because Verizon's website specifically had it listed as an accessory for my LG enV phone (got it from amazon for $10 less than Verizon). What a waste of $15. The phone doesn't quite fit inside the case, a little of it hangs just outside it. And the see-thru window is more for the smaller flip phones - only a portion of the enV's display is visible.If you have a smaller flip phone, such as the standard Motorola, Samsung, etc, maybe this will work fine for you. But if you have the slightly larger enV, don't waste your money."
4,Good Finger Paint Paper,"I bought this paper when it was on sale for just over $5, I'm not sue I would pay regular price for it because $17 seems like a lot for 50 sheets, but it is good, durable paper that is nice & sturdy for art projects!"
5,Finger Paint Paper,"A very generous pad of quality finger paint paper for a small price. The paper is usable on both sides and the size is great for a young artist. I only gave a 2 for duability, because finger paint paper is simply not a durable product by design. If abused, it will tear. If heated with a match, it will burn. Even a 2-year-old can destroy an entire pad in less then fifteen minutes. That said, if you put your grandchild's masterpiece in a frame for display, my bet is it will last longer then you will. This is a well made product suited to its purpose and priced nicely. My 4-year-old granddaughter did discover that it is not suitable for use with crayons, colored pencils, or markers. It is, however, excellent for finger paints."
3,"Great price, great size, a little hard to tear out without ripping the paper","I bought this to go along with the Crayola squeezable fingerpaints. There is a lot of paper, good texture, but it is a little difficult to rip out pieces without tearing the top part of the paper jagged. Kids probably won't mind that, but my OCD tendencies were bothered."
3,Finger Paint Paper,"This paper is great for painting because the paint doesn't soak through onto the next page or whatever's underneath. The only thing I don't like is that when you fold the page over to get to the next one, it automatically rips so you have to tear the sheet off. Which is great if you have paint on the page but if you just draw on it with crayons or anything you still need to tear it off. So, great for finger painting but that's all you can use this paper for."
2,It's Cute for A gift,"I ordered this paper to give to my daughter for her first birthday along with some crayons. Honestly, its a cute gift idea, but the quality of the paper is either equal to or slightly less than the paper I buy for my printer. I won't repurchase.The only way that I can see it being of greater quality is if you are comparing it to the grey-ish colored thin paper drawing pads."
2,"Pages are thin, not durable enough for much paint","The way I have always done fingerpainting is to pour a little glob of paint in the middle, smear it around and then trace lines, shapes, etc. in the paint. However, as soon as my child started smearing her little glob around, the paper buckled and had so many waves in it, it hindered her painting. If I didn't mind paper buckling, I wouldn't have specifically purchased ""fingerpaint paper."" It does have a glossy finish (why it has it on both sides is a mystery), so I gave it two stars for that.I am really surprised that some reviewers commented on the strength and durability of this paper. Maybe they used it with a medium other than paint."
2,Buy a Different One,"I wasn't very pleased with the quality of this paper.Whether we used hands or paintbrushes, the paper got ridiculously soppy wet and started tearing and ripping when I untaped it from the table. When I put it out to dry in the sun, it was so wet that it stuck to the table after it had dried. I like to keep the pictures, and it just won't be possible with this kind of paper. True it is double-sided, but I couldn't use the otherside because of how thin and cheap the paper is. The paint shows through.If it's just for the experience of fingerpainting, this would have been moderately acceptable. It is not so unusable that I'd throw it out, but when it runs out I will certainly not buy this company's again."
5,nice paper!,"Very nice, big, strong paper. We use it for finger paints, paint, markers, everything pretty much!"
5,Love this Company,"I bought their easel, easel paper, their paint set, stamp set eraser, everything I have bought fromt his company has been greatly priced and great quality. I was skeptical at first cause of the cheap pricing but I adore their products, very much worth it!! If you plan on going for their easel, yes a 14 month old can use it on its lowest setting."
2,No a good book,"This book is not a good book. If you want to learn MS access, stay away from this one. With more than 1000 pages without organization. The author better is a fiction writer than a technical writer."
3,Lots of Data But Little Information,"I have to agree with the majority who post about this book that the book is an impressive bricolage of data about all aspects of the application. Certainly having some computer background helped me to understand some technically dense ideas about the various characteristics of Access 2000, but the problem is if you're not a database/computer science person, this book doesn't have enough meaningful examples or interpretation to help you learn. This book is NOT for someone who wants to learn how to develop an Access 2000 Database, and more like a good overview for someone who already is an established database hewer. (Which I suppose is fair since the book posits itself as advanced...)"
2,You get what you paid for,"This book's one of the cheapest ones out there, but it's not worth it. There's too much jargon with not enough explanation. I didn't know ADO vs. DAO and reading the definitions only made things clear as mud.This book is definitely not meant for beginners, yet it doesn't offer any advanced tips to help productivity. I like Alison Balter's Mastering Microsoft Access 2000 Development much better for its clarity and excellent examples."
3,Not for Beginners,"This book is full of information. Unfortunately, if you are a beginner it is a little overwhelming. I was looking for quick step by step instructions on creating an Access DB. This book tries to make you an expert before getting to that point. This book would be a great reference after you've already mastered the basics with a simpler book."
1,Very disappointing,"I'm generally a fan of the Special Edition volumes. They are usually well written and edited, though the indices are usually mediocre. Mr. Jennings' book is, however, a disappointment. The knowledge is certainly there. Unfortunately most of it can be found in the Microsoft Access 2000 Help file. If this volume were better organized and indexed than the Microsoft help file, that would be a benefit of small not inconsiderable importance. Unfortunately, the organization of this book strikes me as worse than the MS Access help file.Important topics are reduced to cryptic index entries - if they are to be found at all. Inter-related information on topics are widely and often illogically separated. Examples are often very sparse and, ultimately, unenlightening.Overall, this volume is a disappointment. The information may very well be contained somewhere in the book, but you can find it faster in other tomes on the subject, in the MS Access help file or the MS KnowledgeBase.Jerry"
2,not a good reference book,"I purchased this book hoping to use it as a reference. There are many interdependencies between chapters. As a result, I am unable to jump to different topics without having to go back to some other chapter to create the tables needed for the new topic. It seems the only way to learn with this book is by reading from cover to cover, in order...1200+ pages! There must be an easier way, so I will return the book tomorrow and try another one."
5,Excellent,This is one of the best chair videos that I have ever seen. Its wonderful for everyone and really helps a lot.
2,Don't like,I have an older sit and be fit for general health. This one for fibro is basically the same. All she adds is a regular size ball. I wish I didn't waste the money on this one. I am serious ill with fibro and found this dvd to be too easy and too short.
5,Great product,"It is difficult to find a 6 count muffin pan. Was elated to find this one at Amazon. If you haven't used Calphalon products, you are losing out. It's the only product I use in the kitchen."
4,As expected,"Quality I expected from Calphalon. Haven't used them yet, but I'm sure I will be soon, with the holidays coming up!"
2,Not much beyond what's in cruise ship brochures,"Pages 1-134 contain rapidly outdated information--best got off the web on what cruise lines go where.Larry Ludmer then fails to deliver on his promise (p152, Cruising the Med) to indicate the location of each port and give some information on getting there. Two examples: Larry please tell us how equipped with a Eurail pass, one gets1) from the Venice train station to the cruise terminal,2) from Livorno cruise terminal to Florence??"
2,"Yeah, uh, tell her to shut up.","The opening track, a clever spoof involving the abuse of a televangelist, was very promising, but it is not a sign of the vocally marred material to come. If this is a techno CD, let her and the Sneaker Pimps have the genre, and I'll move on to greener instrumental pastures. Oddly enough, I don't mind the Sneaker Pimps at all. This disc just irked me."
4,CSI: Miami; Florida Getaway,I found this novel a quick read. It was easy to understand and the characters were true to the TV story line. I have always watched the TV show and this is my first novel related to the show. I would be interested in reading other novels by the same author related to CSI: Miami. Would recommmend this book highly.
4,A Good Start to My CSI: MIAMI Experience,"This was my first CSI: MIAMI serialized novel, and I thoroughly enjoyed it! I have to say that Max Allan Collins, the author who writes the majority of all CSI titles, seems to have a better understanding of Horatio Caine than of Gil Grissom. The character descriptions were much better than some of those I've read in the regular CSI novels.FLORIDA GETAWAY has a case that starts in Las Vegas with the regular CSI team and then spreads to Miami and Horatio's team. It's a well-developed case and a pretty darn good plot. Definitely recommended for CSI and CSI: MIAMI fans!"
4,myserious,"The book CSI Miami, Florida Getaway, is a thrilling murder mystery. When a murder escapes Las Vegas and then finds him self buried in the Miami Beach dead, you know the story is going to be exciting. Max Allan Collins made this story to capture the adventures side of his readers. When you find your self in the Miami heat, remember the book you never wanted to let go of."
2,misguided listing,"This particular order I have written to the seller that I am particular about getting the bottle with brow cap (wooden texture) not a silver cap. And the quality of both differ. The picture shows in all their promotions a bottle with a brown cap. This seller irrespective of my chosing sent the one with a silver cap which is either a duplicate or lesser quality. I have written to them again and expressed my concern and they have not bothered to send me a reply either. I hope and pray that these sellers change their mentality of just make money and enforce anything they have upon us aganist our will, I have kept it and not othered to asked for a refund because this is only one time deal. Never again."
2,"Whoa, strong woodsy and a bit much","I am open to woodsy colognes but this cologne I have heard was good but a ""old"" smell. I didn't let it deter me to try it out. When I got it, I was told I tried one spray, I didn't like it at all. Then I was told it smells like a mix of a hamster cage and kitty litter. I still didn't like the smell even after it wore off, to woodsy with some bite of something I didn't like.. I asked a female in her sixties to smell it.... The look of disgust of what is that smell on her face, sealed the deal for me. Everyone including myself didn't think this was very good.Well for those who wrote positive reviews, I respect your reviews but this is not for me and many others who I asked for their opinion."
1,They break quickly,"I bought one about a month and a half ago. They worked great at first, but one day I went to turn it on and the switch just would not flip up."
5,100%,i have a 4x4 pickup needed a heavy duty switch with cover looking cool works great i did over night shipping ( which can take a lil longer some times do to ur location) (myns rural oregon) it was here the next evening heavy duty looks sweet works great 100 percent worth it!!!!
5,How can we speak of star ratings- Jean Guilou is the best.,"I am sorry that more music lovers are unaware of Mr. Guillou, for he is on of the greatest living musicians and composers today. Just listen to the samples of Vivaldi and you will discover what I'm speaking of, but any Dorian work is evidence of this statment. Many organ lovers know of E. Power Biggs and Virgil Fox, but they were standard performers, period.Jean makes music on the organ that has never been heard before; a true artist for the ages."
1,It didn't help me at all.,"Netopia tech support, a friend of mine, and I myself spent a total of 6 hours trying to make this work in a system where a competitor's analog telephone adapter worked with no problem, but we never succeeded. The unit will be returned to Amazon for a refund. Quite honestly, I'm disgusted with Netopia."
2,Gem Trails of Arizona,"I have the 2001 edition.The directions are very poor. The mileages are off, a lot of the time. There are several new roads out there and with no GPS locations it is kinda hit or miss which road to take. Especially when he shows a ""Y"" and now it's a 3 way or 4 way intersection.I have also been to several of the locations, when I can find them and there is nothing there."
3,Needs better maps and/or GPS coordinates,"This review is based on visiting only 4 of the sites covered in the book. For three of the four sites, I found the hand drawn maps in the book rather confusing. Based on my limited experience, it appears that most AZ roads outside of medium to large population centers are rough, may be unmarked and, if marked, often have names/numbers that may not match the book, the gazetteer, or USGS topo maps. Furthermore, some of these collecting sites are old mine workings that are not readily visible due to overgrowth. In any case, GPS coordinates would take some of the confusion out of the location descriptions. Better maps would help also. However, we did eventually find what was advertised and this certainly is a helpful guide and worth the money spent."
3,sorely in need of another revision,"We tried half a dozen or more of the recommended trails and had success with only one! Arizona has been developing fast and many roads were closed, gone, blocked or built over. We did enjoy our one successful day (although I wish he had noted that it would take hours to cross the unpaved dirt roads...), but lost several vacation days to paths which no longer existed :(We ultimately decided to ditch the book so that we could enjoy more of our vacation and give up the ""wild goose"" chases.I'd recommend this only for people who live in arizona and have abundant time on their hands. expect to experience more disappointments and failures than successes, and you will not be disappointed."
3,An almost guide!,"We have several of these guide books for different states, and while they get you to the general area you are looking, you just don't seem to find the exact spot he was talking about. The mileage is off, so we aren't sure if it is us or him. He does a great job of writing the books, we just wish that we could get the directions figured out better. And I know that it is not just us. Many rockhounds we have talked to have said the same thing about the mileage, it didn't work out and you had to guess. All in all, we will still buy these books and hope to hit a jackpot!!!"
5,great book,"Gem trails has come along way, this new book is great. Great directions, easy to understand, am very pleased with the book"
3,"Strange stuff, but there is some talent here...","Generally speaking, a weird group of songs written by a homicidal maniac. Got interested in this material after hearing the Guns N' Roses take on ""Look at Your Game, Girl"". Feels odd to admit it, but it is a very good song. ""Arkansas"" is pretty good too. Manson appears to actually have had some songwriting talent, and a pleasant voice. Some other songs are pretty good, some not too good at all. One track appears to be accapella singing/chanting by female members of the ""family"", and is exceedingly creepy. Made DAMN SURE that my money DIDNT go to Manson before I bought it. The royalties go to a fund for the family of one of the male victims in the Tate murders (Frykowski); so no harm done there. An interesting buy; some musical talent here, but I place it next to other ""oddities"" on my shelf such as Wild Man Fischer, etc. (Of course, he never killed anybody, but the point is this CD is sort of a kitsch item)."
2,Not the same as original bag,The bags are not the same bags as the original bags that came with the vacuum. They seem of lesser quality.
1,Bad product,"This was a waste of my money. Very disappointed. This product is not the real thing. It didn't fit my vacuum cleaner. It was an immitation, but a very cheap one, in which the cardboard square that is supposed to attach to the vacuum cleaner was smaller and would not secure in place, therefore not fit for its purpose."
3,Now made in China!,"Re-ordered these bags as they WERE made in Ohio, then the new batch came. Not ordering from here again that's for sure!"
3,order review,"The product is fine however, I thought shipping was free which it turned out not the case. Disappointed about that"
4,Good bags - affordable and well made,"I've seen a lot of people knock replacement bags for one reason or another. Poor fitment, poor filtering, etc. These work well - it fit nicely and seemed to feel like it was made well. I can't swear it filters better than any other bag, and I know that 3rd party bags can be quite a bit less, but it's not a huge amount of money - and for all the vacuuming I do (one dog plus one cat = daily vacuuming) I'd like to think the bag is not shooting out a lot of dust - I'd buy these again."
3,Raising confident boys 100 tips for parents and teachers,This book is a good reference guide. A good quick read.
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. The author continually tells the reader to be kind and gentle with children, and then recommends ""alternatives to spanking"" that are simply other types of punishments: time out, removal of privileges, and the like. She simply doesn't get it that children are human beings who behave as well as they are treated, and who will behave well when treated with love and respect. Would the author respond well if her partner tried to control her in these ways? There are many better choices - see the book titles listed at The Natural Child Project and La Leche League websites."
5,This is worth your time and $'s !!,"I've bought a lot of ""raise your child to be"" books, but this one is one that I continue to refer back to. It is very insightful and VERY well layed out which makes it a pleasure to read (half the battle).This book comes into play when your son turns around 18 mos. old, but you'll use it until he is probably in his teens. I pick it up often and read through areas that are important to me at that time and feel like the tips they give you to communicate really do work.I've definitely gotten my money out of this book and I'd recommend this highly."
2,Not helpful,"I didn't see anything that shouldn't have been obvious to any parent. I would not recommend at all. Very, very basic."
2,suzie1967,I purchased this book after reading the great reviews. I am extremely disappointed. This book is simply a laundry list of anything that a parent/teacher could possibly do to give children better self-esteem. Each tip is dedicated two pages. It wasn't what I thought it would be and would not be easy to refer back to any particular item.
2,Too shallow to help much,"I found this book to be incredibly shallow, with only the most superficial advice that wouldn't really help much.The author packs 100 short tips into the book -- a sentence or two each -- and they have such little substance or explanation to them that I didn't find them helpful. Here are a few:""Managed choice means either/or decisions. Put limits on the choices.""""Avoid doing all the judging so that your son won't become dependent on your opinion and lose faith in his own.""""Encourage imaginative play and dressing up.""Really? Come on. There isn't much here that is specific to boys, and most of these tips have been covered ad nauseam in just about every other child-rearing book out there."
1,Vague nonsense for the gullible,"Using strings of the keywords that seem to charm the seeker, ""Master"" Charles (recently promoted from his former name ""Brother Charles"" - how far can he go?) fills his book with vague claims and more vague promises.The fact the so many of these books are for sale ""used"" (and no doubt unread) may be a warning.Watch the parking meeters"
1,Danger,"My sister sent me this book after hearing that I was going to my local church. She said that Charles had the ""secret"" of life - listening to clicks and clacks on a tape created by Charles to harmonize my brain. I find that MC got ""it"" and now lives in the hills with disciples, and teaches his reformated gnosticism to those tired of Shirley MacLaine, but not yet ready for Father O'Brien. I see the problem, but found this book very hazy and unfocused. Perhaps those better schooled in the new-age, the undefined words will make sense: unity of all things, the potential that lies inside of you, and so on. It reads like that Saturday Night Live guy wrote it. Enough incense-like words, and some undergraduates at odds with their parents will buy into it.I see danger."
1,Do not order from this seller,"I ordered this watch ""used"". The seller stated that it was slightly scratched and needed a good polishing. That much is true. However he failed to mention that the watch needed $800 in repairs. The watch doesnt even work!! Now I have to send it back to Breitling for a complete overhaul. Don't order from this seller!"
3,works but poorly,"This is the second unit I have purchased. The first unit worked right out of the box but had poor sensitivity. The transmitter had to be placed directly on the bells in order for it to work, after a few months it stopped working all together.The second unit has the same sensitivity problem, but is working for now."
5,TREMENDOUS band and album,"Hayehudim started as an Israeli underground band and quickly gained a cult following due to intense live performances. At the forefront of this band are vocalists Tom Petrover and Orit Sachaf - who are married. Both are exceptionaly powerfull singers possessing a good range. The rest of the band are are top local session musicians - although most of this lineup changed years later. Tom writes the lyrics and music.This album is one of the best rock albums to come out of Israel or anywhere in this world. Accessible songs that flow from one to the other, alternating and dual vocals, classy lead guitars, pianos and awesome singing that spoke of addiction, love, religion and death made this album truly unforgettable.Eight years after its release this album has stood the test of time and has lost none of its power. Although some listeners will not understand the hebrew lyrics, they will relate to the mood and energy of the album.A must have in any collection."
5,Israel Rocks!,"Wow, what can I say?I love this CD! I have had this gem for about 6 months now and think they are one of the best bands I have heard in a while. This group is an Israeli rock band. They rock!"
2,Harsh light,"Note that this is not a frosted or satin bulb, hence, the light is pretty harsh, not the gentle light usually associated with full-spectrum bulbs."
5,MAGICAL FAIRY TALES ALL ROLLED UP IN ONE,THERE WERE PARTS IN THE STORY THAT WERE SO ENLIGHTENING I HAD TO GO BACK AND READ AGAIN ESPECIALLY THE EXPLANATION OF WHAT WITCHCRAFT REALLY IS...I WILL TREASURE THIS STORY AND CANT WAIT TO READ IT TO MY SON.........I SHALL NEVER LOOK FOR THE FAE DANCE
3,A Bear Was His Wet Nurse,"Lump was born ugly and with no talent for magic. But we was adopted by a witch, educated by a chained demon, critiqued by the witch's cat and nursed by a she-bear. Toward's story's end Lump, now rich, has a chance to be kind to that now ancient, chained bear but ignores her plight in his lust for a ditzy king's daughter whom he loads with gold.There was another she-bear mentioned early on Nol, who befriended Lump when he was three and playing with neighboring young bears. Nol licked Lump's scratched face, marveled at his un-bearish tears and warned him not to cross a stream to invade a bee hive. She does not reappear. Pity. Lump might have turned himself around sooner than he eventually does."
5,I really liked this book,I rented this book from the library and it is a really good book. I like how they touched upon other fairy tales. It was a good read and hard to put down - I needed to know what will happen next...Will Lump change and be a better person - will he find love - will he forgive his mother - will he forgive himself.
3,For Serious Climbers Only,"This is a well researched and extremely detailed volume designed for the serious hiker in the Sandia Mountains. I actually bought it for the map of the area, which was noted by the seller as ""included"" (and it was). Unfortunately, the material is a little out of date despite the 1993 third revision. A number of the trails and some of the roads have altered over the years, so actual experience may be at variance to that detailed in the book. Still, it is probably the most authoritative work on this subject available today."
3,not what you think,"10 pieces that really are only 6 pieces (comforter, bed skirt, 2 shams, 2 curtain panels). They count the all in one piece panel as 3 pieces each (panel, valance, and liner). It's cheap but really not worth much more."
3,Chemistry of Fragrances,"I purchased the book as a beginner perfumer hoping it would give me a backround in aroma chemicals used in perfumery. As I don't have a background in chemistry I found the book, especially the first chapters pretty hard going as it explains more the chemical structures of common aroma chemicals and how they are derived, as opposed to their creative uses in modern perfumery. It is still worth reading if you have begun perfumery as a hobby and has useful information on how many ingredients are produced and an inside view on modern production methods. It hasn't really hit the spot for me and I will be back online hunting for another book to purchase."
4,Coolest deck lights,These lights mount flush in deck and wire up easily. The remote does not work that good but maybe the battery is weak. The diameter of the lights are about an inch and they are hardly noticed in the daytime. They look awesome at night. We have the blue ones. These really add class to our new deck.
4,"great lights, shabby wiring","I loved the LED Deck lights. We got the blue ones. Very small, but puts off alot of light for the size. Fits flush with the deck and you can hardly tell they are there during the day. Installation was a pain because the connectors included with the set didn't work. My husband had to hard wire every light in himself. Thank goodness he is an elecrician. Overall, I love the lights and the small hassle was worth it."
5,Blue LED Deck Lights,"These are pretty cool lights. Easy install and with them being LED I am hoping that there are no burnouts for many years. Have not seen these installed anywhere else and when compared to solar caps for deck posts, they are far more inexpensive and look really cool at night. I installed them right against the 4x4 vinyl post covers and the light shines up the post adding to the unique look. These are more of an accent light and a perimeter identification type light than a light used for overall illumination. Great for ambience lighting."
1,The light kit does not working,"I got this light set, it is open box, looks like some one returned from store. It doesn't work at all. Return requested."
4,My nephew loved it,We bought this for my 2 yr old nephews birthday. He is horse crazy and loved it! Very pretty piec of work and sturdy.
1,JUNK,Do not waste your money. It will not hold a cane or stay on the wheelchair!!!!!!! Total ripoff. I gave one star because I could not give minus stars
2,Not much help,"I bought this book because I am trying to research psychiatric hospitals. I honestly didn't find it to be helpful. I was looking for examples of daily activities and routines in the hospitals. Instead, the author uses a lot of broad statements to cover aspects of just about any asylum. He mainly discusses the feelings and attitudes of the inmates and their caretakers. The book reads like a textbook. I can't say I really learned anything."
1,Unbelievable waste of time,"The tilt mechanism would not hold up a 16 lb. 20 inch LCD, even though it says it supports up to 30 lbs. The bolt that is supposed to be locked in the factory was failing. Called the company and they sent a replacement mechanism, which was scratched and used. That too failed. I tried to explain this to the woman on the phone but she was very rude, not helpful and very defensive. She tried to tell be I wasn't tightening it properly. I told her I could tork on it for five hours and it wouldn't help because it was the factory bolt that was failing. I can't understand how a company like this can have such crude support and products. It's a pretty simple concept and I didn't expect it to drag on for three weeks."
5,vm3b mount,received it in 3 working days real good price going to use it on my boat was like advertised
4,pocket hole screws,These screws came quickly and as advertised. I have since found them for a lower price at a different location.
2,Not Bronze colored,"These were supposed to be BRONZE colored screws, but where shiny chrome. I would not have bought them had I known. Don't know why Kreg changed their color of these pockethole screws. It's not like you want to highlight them. The description of these screws needs to be updated to reflect what they really are."
5,"Indeed, the promotional materials seem specious","for Babbitt's music is, of all things, not pretty, or at least not 'merely pretty.' They act as though Babbitt has turned to writing lullabies in his dotage. In fact he hasn't. He's doing what he's always been doing-- writing compelling, exotic, occasionally perverse, but always intriguing works that at their best engage the listener's sense of wonder at the vast possibilities of the musical universe. In Goldray Babbitt has found a wonderfully sensitive interpreter who makes Babbitt's music sound richer, more detailed and more capacious than it ever has."
4,"Great music, great CD; where are the liner notes?","I love the recording I already had of the NY Kammermusiker (A Baroque Celebration), and was thrilled to find this other CD.I am very happy with the music, but ... but ... this is apparently a re-release of this disc, and the copy (brand-new!) that I got has liner notes that are virtually useless. It only lists 24 of the 40 tracks, and the inside of the liner is absolutely blank. I'm particularly disappointed because of the comment by Christian Ellithorpe in his December 6, 2002 review - ""There are also very interesting notes with explanations about the dances & short bios on the many composers on this disc. ""So, is this an economy measure by Dorian, or did I just get a bum copy?Listening but not reading, - Susan"
1,received used part,"This ACdelco D1922A was purchased on the assumption the part was new @ $114. Corrosion on the bottom and depression marks on the connector seal indicated the ICM was used. The part works but for how long? Stocklift LLC maintains they do not sell used parts. They obviously don't know their inventory. To be fair, had I noticed this before my 30 day expiration, the part would have been replaced. For that I give them 1 star."
5,acdelco ignition Control Module Assembly,mine went bad after 20 years got a new gm quality part at a fraction of the dealer price here at amazon
5,Solved bonneville dies,This and coil pack solved my issue with the car suddenly dieing at highway speed and also solved my tach from jumping around.
5,Check It Out,"Read this book for the broad spectrum of grants, prizes, etc., but be sure to also check out West Point, the best kept secret as a FULL scholarship college, by reading ""West Point: Character Leadership Education"" by Norman Thomas Remick, available right here on Amazon.com along with ""Peterson's Scholarships..."""
1,Unsatisfactory,This is such a bad album. The sound quality is disappointing and the singing is very flawed. Shouldn't have been released in the first place!
3,What makes this woman tick,"i was fascinated by what drove this seemingly normal american female to become the prototypical feminist, years ahead of her time. She was on the cutting edge of the american female awakening during the sufferage movement. This book would make a great Psychology report for the college student looking for a topic. She did some very non-typical things for a woman of her era and that is what the book is about. The 'why' is not told but left for the reader to analyze. There were some key people that changed/forged the course of her life. (mom, dad, college roommate, first boss, Englishman living in Africa, Greek in Africa, chinaman, hypnotist, married English intelligence officer)"
3,To many blank spots,"I enjoyed the first book ""A DREAM APART"", but this one ""A DREAM EMBRACED"" left me with many questions. There was also information that I really did not want to know if there will not be additonal books. I had a hard time understanding what happened during one of the battles in the book. If there is a book 3, when will it be released and will it be the last."
1,What?,"It is interesting that Allington would refer to lessons from exemplary first-grade classrooms. I heard him speak and the man said ""9 out of 10 first grade teachers are useless."" This man was so offensive and disrespectful. It is apparent that his work comes from a place of deep bitterness, not a real desire to help teachers, help students. He is more concerned with being heard as to his own bitter opinions. I do not suggest any educator read his work. Surely there are many superior educators that have published and deserve your time...NOT Allington. Try Keene, Miller, Harvey, Daniels,....anyone but this man."
3,The comic is alive!,"Skipper is a comiic book fanatic he's got every one but he never reads them. The only one he has to read is the Masked Mutant. In the latest episode it shows The Masked Mutant's headquarters for the first time ever,cool. The next day Skipper finds The Masked Mutant's headquarters and just has to go in soon Skipper relizes that The Masked Mutant's alive and is out for the kill...."
3,I think that this book should be read by everyone.,"I read the book called The Attack of the Masked Mutant. I want people to pay attention to the book because there are a lot of good and scary parts in the book. One my favorite parts in the book was when the main character, Skipper, saw the Masked Mutant headquarters one day, and the day it was gone. What happened was he had invisible cloth over it so the good guys wouldn't get him. The part I didn't like was when one of the good guys killed the Masked Mutant. It was one of the most scary parts in the whole book. So I think everyone should read Goosebumps: Attack of the Masked Mutant by R.L. Stine."
4,A good book with a lot of thrills,This is a excellent goosebumps book. The book is about a boy with a lot of school problems because he reads comic books all the time. After school one day he finds a building that looks just like the headquarters of his favorite comic book villian. He decides to go in and... you'll have to read the book!
5,I loved this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I loved this book, especially when the Masked Mutant turned into a snake."
5,kids books,"These books are helping my grandson learn the enjoyment of reading. He was having a hard time, but these books hold his attention and he really looks forward to getting a new one in the series."
2,One of the better GOOSEBUMPS,This book was good for a Goosebump book but was too unrealistic and didn't come up to par with realistic literature.
1,one word: PATHETIC,I cannot BELIEVE that this book is rated as horror. I would put it down as comedy or something like that. I'll admit that it was creative but it was a pathetic attempt at 'horror'.
3,Don't use UPS!!!!!!!,"One the case that the trombone comes in is durable UPS Shove somthing very heavy into it and cracked the case!It said fragile in big red letters on the box! UPS CAN'T READ! The Horn was still in good shape.Horn should be cleaned first before you put it together! Mine was full of some kind of lint. Other than that it has perfect tone. Good beginner trombone :] ""UP DATE"" UPS NOW STEALS FROM CUSTOMERS"""
1,Trombone did not work,"This was the worse purchase I ever made. The mouthpiece did not even fit the trombone. When I contacted the company, they refused to take any action and wanted me to send pictures of their mistake. The local music shop could not repair it or find a mouthpiece that would fit."
4,love it but still not abel to wear it.,"so i'm a girl and wanted an armor ring, i fell in love with the bird's skull and wanted it!i knew it'd had to be resized for my tiny fingers but i still went ahead and ordered it, it did say ""adjustable"" after all.it's beautiful beyond words! but not as adjustable as i would like. i took it to a jeweler to try to get it fixed but since it's pewter, jeweler wants nothing to do with it and says it'll get ruined if he messes with it....soooooi'm in need of a new jeweler so that i can finally wear it. :(("
2,bird skull finger armour ring review,"The shiping was great it didn't take long, but the rings quality left much to be desired. the hinges are weak both the first one on the right side and the last one broke... you could see that there wasn't much material holding it together in the first place... but the rest of the hinges held."
4,Jersey Devil tales make for a devilishly good read.,"This book will tell you just about everything there is to know about the history of The Jersey (or Leeds) Devil and its countless sightings in and around the Garden State. The biggest compliment I can give is that I did not want the book to end, I wanted to know more about this folklore legend and its various sightings over the last two hundred or so years. Good thing there is a sequel, I'll be buying it."
4,"Sinister, devilish, fun","There are few that don't know the story of Mrs. Leed's little baby that was born a devil. Or I should say that there are few that don't a version of the story. There are as many different versions of the tale as there are people in Jersey. Some say that she had so many children, she wished her last one was a devil, and her wish came true. Some say that something scared the poor woman so much that she gave birth to a monster.This is a book that examines all aspect of the legend with pictures, carvings, and articles that date back to the first mentions of the demonic beast in the 1800's. It offers many articles, sketches, and photos that are unique to this volume.Perhaps my only complaint is that it's a bit thin. I would have liked more.But still it's a great addition to your library whether you're from Jersey, like Mythology, or history."
3,Good Little Book on Jersey Devil,"I thought this book was a short and sweet overview on the Jersey Devil. It explores the various different opinions on the Jersey Devil and the origin, etc. I didn't find it scary or very thrilling but more of a historical account of the legend."
2,Let Hair Metal Die,"Well what can I say I picked this cd up at wizard world, the band was there blasting some of the songs of their cd through surrounding envirement the funny thing is it sounded better when I was there, probably because of the crowded envirement of the time, and I really didnt care if their was any quality music playing, but key note the cd sucks. don't take my word for it however unless you are like me and hate hair metal which is what the band is unless thy evolve and change, but until then they are a modern indie hair metal band, but if you love hair metal well this cd may or may not be your cup of tea. I cant realy judge the genre because I hate it all, except for guns and roses which kick ass."
1,shipped wrong product,they substituted another design of a giant dragonfly. i did not like it. they said the sun and moon design no longer exists.very unhappy as this just created more work for me.
1,substitution problem,"Same problem with other reviews. I received a different design sun/moon combo than what was ordered. The substitution was harder to read and smaller in size. The company substitutes whatever clock it pleases for the model number 02327A1. In addition, I have to pay for the return shipping for an item I did not order."
2,Sun & Moon Clock,"Was disappointed in the quality of this clock. Thought the price was too high after actually seeing this clock. We did return it. Also we planned to place it up high on a wall on our patio. When we tried it, you could hardly see the numbers to tell the time. I would not recommend this product.This is the only item that I've ever returned to Amazon - & I've been a loyal Amazon customer for quite sometime now.Sorry - but this isn't a great buy."
2,Not the essence of clarity.,"The author makes the following comment: ""....literature on hedging in futures marets is not the essence of clarity."" I hope he was including himself. If you don't have a pretty good foundation in Futures you don't need to start w/ this book. I don't know why writers can't start with the basics and work up to the complex nuances. I was very disapointed."
3,Horslips - Unfortunate Cup Of Tea - Outlet/Homespun records,"Horslips - Unfortunate Cup Of Tea - Outlet/Homespun recordsTracks are:- If That's What You Want (That's What You Get)- Ring-A-Rosey- Flirting in the Shadows- Self Defence- High Volume Love- The Unfortunate Cup of Tea- Turn Your Face to the Wall- The Snakes' Farewell to the Emerald Isle- Everything Will Be AlrightThis is the original and out of print older remaster of this album on CD. A nice collectible piece for the Horslips fan that has everything, but for a first time fan I recommend picking up the newer remaster on Demon records which was released under direct supervision by the band after they reacquired their back catalog."
5,A superb book on modifications to Newton's Laws,"Based on the astronomical evidence, this book reformulates Newton's Laws to account for deviations from inverse square-law behavior at cosmological distances. The author explains gravitational redshifts by adding a cosmic (velocity) drag term as well as an inertial induction term (similar to that of Faraday induction for electromagnetics) as possible modifications to Newton's Law. The book is rich in equations, including a detailed and straightforward analysis of their meaning. Prof. Ghosh has done a superb job in generalizing Newton's inverse-square law."
5,Great CD,"This is the trombone player that you often hear with Sonny Rollins. Clifton Anderson decided to release his own album with members of the Sonny Rollins band like bassist, Bob Cranshaw. He brought in Kenny Garrett, alto Saxophone, for one song, and the whole CD is great and a good first album for maybe one of the great jazz trombonists of tomorrow."
3,Mediocre,"I love Bal-Sagoth, but this cd is really a big cluster of noise. Some may really like that.......but Ienjoy their earlier efforts, in which I can enjoy the tempo changes. It's ok imo."
3,It's Busy,"I like this album. I've listened to it twice now and I know something is there, but it's so thick I haven't found it yet. If you want to challenge yourself with this type of black fantasy metal go for it, if you're looking for something more accessible maybe start with Atlantis Ascendant."
4,Spicy lima beans purchased from Amazon,"The beans are a bit salty but very good if you have good teeth. I did have a problem in that they were over a month beyond the pull date. I knew they would be stale before we could finish them. I called and was told that food items can't be returned. However, at my request, my money was refunded so I believe this to be an honest company to deal with."
1,Shallow treatment,"If you think an American Patriot is someone who blows up buildings then this is the book for you HOWEVER...If you believe that a real patriot is someone who believes in the Constitutional, personal liberty as afforded by our founding fathers and one who strongly dislikes the socialist/fascist direction America is quickly sinking into...you won't want to buy this book.You will have to dig deeper to get to the real issues of real patriots."
3,On the front lines,"This book is a compelling look at the Yom Kippur War of 1973. It is at its best when it shares the stories of soldiers fighting at the front and when it relays the thoughts of the Egyptian military commander. One gets a feeling for the brutality of combat, as well as the chaos and relentlessness of it all.As it gets further from the action, it gets weaker - Golda Meir and Anwar Sadat never move to the forefront of the story. The U.S. airlift isn't mentioned at all, nor the U.S.-Soviet brinksmanship that threatened to make this a world war. In my mind, the book lacks context because of these omissions."
5,A second holocaust barely averted,"Overwhelmed by a massive surprise attack, the Israeli armed forces were nearly decimated within 72 hours. How did the Israelis reverse their bad fortune? How did this happen to begin with? In this narrative, Mr. Blum presents us with the perspective of individuals, major and minor, on both sides of the conflict.One must ponder what the result could have been, had the Israeli people failed in their darkest hour. Israel's enemies have stated very frequently and openly about the genocide to follow, if they ever succeed in their goal. Israel, a thriving free nation on the very precipice, can not afford to make such errors in judgement again."
1,"If you are an historian, spend your money someplace else","Blum's book seems accurate as far as it goes, and might be enjoyable for someone who knew nothing of the Yom Kippur War. However, for any casual student (let alone a serious one) of military history in general, or the Arab-Israeli wars in particular, the book is as useful for in-depth understanding as ""Johnny Tremain"" was for the American Revolution.There are much better personal accounts of the heroism involved (""The Heights of Courage""). And, though the spy story is interesting, Blum omits entirely the mid-war US re-arming of Israel, and the desperate and deadly backdrop of concurrent US-USSR diplomacy. The superpower confrontation shaped the whole conduct of the war; making no mention of it in his reonstruction of top-level Israeli wartime strategic discussions is ludicrous."
2,The Untold Story About the Eve of Destruction,"What this book does well is highlight some of the military strategy in the Yom Kippur War in easy to understand terms.But it is not a good book for learning about what actually happened in the war, wartime diplimatic manuevers, or how or why the war ended. The book skips these topics. If you want to learn about those things, you will have to read another book."
1,Hardware crash three weeks from new!,"Three weeks after I bought the darn thing it crashed. I only installed Microsoft Office software. I'm working away on a project when bam! The Blue Screen of Death appears to inform me that Windows XP had to quit. Then a totally dark screen.Then the system starts back up, with a box offering to send an error report to Microsoft. I click it. Microsoft thinks for a minute then writes back: hardware failure. Either the memory, the power supply or the motherboard is defective. They're not sure which, but it's serious. The computer is obviously working for the moment, but unreliable.Now I'm stuck. I can replace the computer, but Microsoft won't let me load their software a second time. I'll have to shell out $hundreds again for software I just purchased.My opinion: I'm sorry I took a chance on this cheap computer. As someone once said, ""The anguish of low quality endures long after the thrill of low price is gone."""
3,Weird,"Xmas gift for our daughter (3 1/2). She finished it in two days. Basically you just move room to room clicking on things, and each room has a piece of the spell that you ""find"". There aren't really any puzzles to solve. I agree with the other reviewer about the tedious audio introduction, and they call the witch ""stupid"", which we try to avoid around here. I gave 3 stars because she isn't bored with it yet, but I'm sure it will be in the CD pile on the floor soon."
3,This is great.... when you get it,"I purchased this for my husband who loves his Toyota truck. He loved it and read the magazine cover to cover. He hardly ever reads anything cover to cover! I used it as a Christmas list because he found things in it that he wanted to add to his truck but didn't want to spend the money on. Here is the reason I only gave it 3 stars... We didn't receive all of our issues. I contacted Amazon and they were very helpful. After contacting them, we received one of the missing magazines. We only received 4 magazines total. I have ordered it again because the hubby loved it so much. I will have to make sure I contact Amazon or the magazine as soon as we notice we didn't get one of them.Here is the break down...1. The magazine itself is great and lots of information.2. The magazine has great ideas for purchases and upgrades to your truck3. Not getting all of your magazines kinds of sucks."
5,Best Toyota magazine,"I have been a subscriber to this magazine almost since it first came out.Since I am a Toyota enthusiast, this one is all Toyota, so I know I am going to get my fill of Toyota related articles.Also for the past year or so they are now including expedition/overlanding trip report articles sent in from subscribers.Very cool to see Toyotas being used in other countries for trips.I highly recommend this magazine."
4,Big Screen Cleaner,"Seems to work pretty well. Just used it on my 52"" Sony two days ago and it really cleaned it up."
3,DVD and Music,"I think that this is a good DVD, but I like the paper music version instead of the on screen music and techniques."
3,great¡,"the product does what it said, however does not run in mac¡¡¡¡ big problem, they should warning about that IT IS ONLY FOR PC."
3,Interesting work,"This work is a kind of modern music, and shows us a kind of ideal of communism. Each piece of the work originated from songs from previous Soviet. Schanzer, the composer, arranged them for quratet & a percussion. We can feel social realism in this work. The last piece 'Internationale' is my favorite one.But..I can tell you.. plz do not compare this work with Shostakovich's or Prokofiev's..you know. They are qualified and the best communist composers. :)Relax and just enjoy this one, and then you will be interested in this music."
2,not what is expected,The documentary was very boring and not what you expect. It looks very amaturish and has the tone of a home video. I do not recommended it. It is not worth the price.
3,Good for the price,"it was cheap, so its good for the price , its not the best if your looking for something good"
5,very sexy,"have been listening to this album for 15 years and I still love it. Sexy, fun, and great to dance to."
5,Lords of Acid's seminal work,"Lust is representative of the Lords of Acids best Club/Dance music offerings. The lyrics are explicit and the beats, while repetitive, are catchy and you just can't help dancing to them. The CD includes club hits ""I Must Increase My Bust"" and ""Rough Sex"". The song ""Most Wonderful Girl"" is also featured in Sliver (the movie with Sharon Stone and Billy Baldwin). If you buy one Lords of Acid CD (and that is likely), let it be this one because the subsequent offerings have all been subpar."
3,I like Lust.,"I've owned their Voodoo-U album and many singles for years, yet never got Lust. Based on all the rave reviews I got it. I found it to be good, but not quite the classic some fans do. Half the album is nearly indistinguishable, and the stronger songs I don't think are strong enough. I'm happy to now own ""The Most Wonderful Girl"" and ""I Must Increase My Bust"", but the rest doesn't blow me away.I'd have to say I like Voodoo-U more. Also if I was really wanting a techno album heavy on sex, I'd first go with Thrill Kill Kult's Sexplosion disc. It trades the agression for a disco and ""groovy"" mood. Still this is good, I'm just not in lust with it like others are. They do have a Greatest Tits collection too."
3,It's worth the buy for the songs that are good,"I'm not a huge fan of LoA for what they did to Lady Galore, in having her sing all their songs and giving her no credit. That said, this album has some great tracks and some dated, boring ones.Take Control: boringRough Sex: excellentLet's get high: decentThe most wonderful girl: excellentI Sit on Acid: excellent, but the remix (the first of the two, I mean) is even betterSpacy Bitch: goodPump My Body to the Top: goodMixed Emotions: boringLessons in Love: boring and stupid (seriously, who hasn't thought of doing the stuff she names?)Hey Ho!: boringI must increase my bust: excellentI sit on Acid remix: EXCELLENT; better than original and worth the price of this CDThe Wet Dream: goodParis France: goodI sit on Acid 96 remix: not as good as the other remix, but worth the listen."
3,Dance Hall Noise,"If you don't know what to expect, here's the deal on LoA: .... Their music is mostly heavy electronic with thumping bass and wild female vocals. There's explicit lyrics in most of their tunes. -- but at least they're a little more poetic than your average [group]. All in all they go down quite well. This is a dance CD but I'd pick my tracks carefully before playing this at a party.If you know what to expect: This CD has a lot of wonky, over the top euro dance noise to it -- think MC Hammer and early 90's dance/house. I liked it less than the two other Lords of Acid albums I have (Our Little Secret and Expand your Head). But I still listen to it and enjoy it. The Rough Sex track is excellent though."
2,"Fast Service, DVD Content was lousy.",Customer service was very fast. I would buy from this seller again. The DVD Content however..Not very good. I'd save my money on this one. But the seller got it to me fast.
5,Awesome Choreography!,"This is the best dance cardio workout I have ever done. The choreography is complex and he teaches it really quickly, but he repeats it enough that I got it after just one workout (but it doesn't repeat so much that it gets boring!). There is apparently a bonus section where he breaks the moves down more slowly. This DVD reminded me of real dance studio type classes, not an aerobics class at a gym. I was working my tail off but I was having so much fun- this DVD is a must for anyone who ever wanted to be an NBA dancer!!"
1,Worst exercise DVD I've ever seen,"If you are a beginner like I am, this is NOT for you. I found this very hard to follow, got very frustrated after a few attempts and gave up! He does make a good point at the beginning...its not really recommended to do the steps on carpet."
2,I wish the instructor took this more seriously,"I'm sorry, but this instructor is just to ""giggly"" for me. He introduces the other two participants and then the giggling starts. It's very distracting for me to see a fitness professional acting this way. I'm not saying he does not cue well or the music is bad, I just can't take him seriously."
5,Distant Voices Still Lives,"Davies' masterpiece of childhood memory, evoked often as disjointed scenes and frozen tableau - much the way memory actually functions. He is describing a life in Liverpool, very like his own, before the Beatles, before rock n roll. This is a dirty working class milieu where the chief threat is a violent father, the chief solace a loving mother and the principle entertainment family and friends having a sing-along in the pub. There is no money to spend, and precious little sign of a better tomorrow: and yet this family contrives to hang together and to make a new generation of children welcome. Sombre and yet uplifting."
3,Metal Gods 2.0,"Marshall Law were a local band, that me & my friends kinda adopted, & would follow around Birmingham, Coventry & I think we saw them in Milton Keynes.They were heavily influenced by Judas Priest circa ""Ram it Down"" which was probably not the best Priest period, but we like them.Now this is the probably the first time I've listened to this album in over twenty years, & the production is very Eighties, especially the drums & Vocals.It a nice enough debut, but didn't really capture quality of the songs live.I lost touch with the band after this record, but I notice they carried on releasing albums, so I might check out some of their catalogue."
3,It was o.k and fun to watch.,"It was o.k. I remember it from my youthful days and compared to what is on today, it is pretty mild."
1,Crummy Crummy! It stinks.,"What a mess. This thing was marked as a custom OE fit to my 1984 Toyota 4WD Pickup. It is not custom anything. The thing simply will not sit properly against the door panel, leaving a gap almost 1/4 inch between the mirror frame and the door panel. Stinks."
4,ocean blue simulated opal earrings - lots of compliments!,"These earrings are very pretty for what you pay. I've received many compliments on them especially when I've worn them outside in sunshine - they really sparkle and show their colors vividly in bright sunlight. They look nice with blue, turquoise, pink, white or black clothing."
1,Don't Buy!,Don't let the picture fool ya. I got these earrings in and they looked nothing like as the picture showed. I wasn't too happy about that. I do not recommend buying these earrings.
4,Great lights but one went bad.,"These lights are really very good. I have two sets and they are great for creating patterns around planters on decks. I have mine hooked up to an electronic timer so the lights come on and go off every night without having to use the remote. One problem I have is that one of the LED assemblies wasn't properly sealed so water got in. Now it will not light up and trying to get support from Philips has so far been fruitless. I certainly don't want to spend $100 on another set just to get one replacement LED assembly. Here's hoping Philips will come through.Oops--I meant to update this review a looooong time ago! Phillips did come through and sent me a replacement--however, it wasn't easy getting a hold of the right person.Lights are awesome: Everyone who sees them has a ""wow"" comment about them."
1,Not Impressed,"I thought this may be a great book as I have always been interested in the mining community culture, having grown up in West Virginia the heart of coal country. I was not able to finish this book as a result of the overdeveloped chararcter profiles which took pages to get through and the loong drawn out intro chapters. So unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, I never got to the part about the mine disaster. Maybe I've averted a disaster...."
5,Amazon needs to get their story straight.,"First of all, in the editorial review - product description above, Tom Howard NEVER had a cocaine addiction - He NEVER took cocaine.Please take that line out - it is completely untrue.As for this album, it's too bad it is unavailable because it is great. Songs like Shine Your Light, Strong Love, & Danger in Loving Youare great. Hard to believe it's almost 30 years old.Rest in Peace Tom. You will be missed."
5,Excellent Music!,"I bought this CD after browsing around on Amazon late one night. I recognized a couple of the tunes and was hoping to find something different to add to my growing collection of Early Music. And while I did not fully know what to expect, this has become a favorite I reach for every few days. There are many obscure instruments and older sounds on this record. And the woman singing soprano (Custer LaRue) has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard.The CD is a nice mix of instrumentals and vocal pieces. And the sounds take you back to another time. The musicians really nailed the Early Music vibe with this recording.There are detailed liner notes (in several languages) that give you information about the tunes. And there are many good photos of the musicians and the instruments used on the recording.Anyone that is already into or wanting to get into the older sounds will love this CD. Highly recommend!"
5,Refreshingly Ancient Music,The Baltimore Consort performs the music of early Scotland with a crisp and light hand. The various compositions on this CD sound astonishingly contemporary given their medieval and renaissance origins. This an immensly enjoyable collection.
1,"Agreed, poorly researched and twisted scripture","The author will bash about how bipolar, ADHD, Schizophrenia, Bipolar and other disorders do not exist without any backup evidence that those don't exist. He just makes one quote from a times magazine article saying ADHD doesn't exist and tells you to read a line in the scripture to go 'discipline' yourself. If you believe this, then by all means throw away all medications that is supposed to relieve you of your daily bipolar depression and get you through your day. Good luck and becareful. I'm sure God created medicine on earth for such purpose. She treats Christianity as if Jesus is the 'Cosmetic Psychologist' where He is the answering to all of our daily emotions and Psychological problems. That's not what He came down to earth for folks.http://bipolar.about.com/od/religion/a/christian_views.htmlPlease do not be deceived by some of her false preachings of scripture and lack of research in this book."
1,Misinformed; poorly researched!,"One of the basic points of this text sets the stage for an ""opinion piece"" presented as a factual or clinical text. The authors base this text on the experience of one [professional] and her [...] husband. The text claims that Psychologically based Counselors proceed by their ""gut"" and not by any protocol. It goes on to state that there are zero protocols for decision making in therapy. Any respectable student or practioner of psychology can tell you differently. There are a multitude of software programs that ""automatically"" set-up diagnosis and treatment protocols based on testing results and bio-psych-social information. The authors go on to stamp Gods name on their opinions as many ""religious"" people do. This is a poorly researched and poorly written text that may mislead many Christians wanting to ""help or be helped."""
1,This book is bunk,"There is nothing of value to be found in this book. No science, no reason, no truths. Just one person's opinions on how to best keep people who need help from getting it. The bible never says not to use medication or seek help from a therapist. Why would God want you to remain so depressed you can't get out of bed on Sunday to go to church or so manic you can't control your impulses when you could actually solve these problems with the help of medical professionals? There are no lasting answers to your problems in this book. The placebo of prayer wears off quickly and all you're left with is bunk."
4,Satisfactory,It is as described and and received in time. It also fits to the car as advertised. I am satisfied.
4,A Lovely Addition to your Child's life,I learnt this song when I was a child and when I could share this with my kids - it was a joy. The illustrations are sweet & give the child something to search for on each page. The music is great & helps you learn the song yourself - so you can sing the song as a family.
4,teddy bear picnic,great book --sweet story and wonderful art --BUT was hoping for the cassette ---jerry garcia was to sing on it ---tape not sent ( be very sure that when ordering that the tape is included) ---to be fair the seller was VERY gracious and helpful
1,Dissapointed,"I bought this for my niece for Christmas. I had it shipped to my mom's house. When I got there, a couple days before Christmas, I was truly disappointed in the product. What I received was a small cardboard book. The picture looks like a large book and claims to come with a tape that has Jerry Garcia and David Grissman doing a song. No tape. No mention of Jerry or Dave on the book. Poor product, poor description, poor presentation of product on the Amazon page. Now I must find something for my niece last minute to go with tiny book."
4,Lovely book,"Having taken my granddaughter to a ""teddy bear picnic"" earlier this summer, I had wanted to get a book with the words so I could teach her the song. Lovely illustrations."
3,Good to Fair,"I owned this unit for several years. In the past two years it has not always kept proper time, and I would have to set it by hand. It also did not always sync with the atomic signal to receive the right time. At times it has been very tempermental in its functioning. Just recently it began a beeping noise. I contacted the company, and they tried to help, but to no avail. I finally had to replace it with a Model 00754W2 that is much cheaper and, so far, seems to function better than this model."
2,Mediocre,"The atomic clock has only worked once in a great while. It won't update anymore and it's annoying to look at this thing and always see the wrong time.Don't lose the manual since there does not appear to be any info on how to program this thing online.Outside temperature works ok if you can find a north facing location near to where the unit will be. Also, you cannot place the unit where there is any heat absorbing material (asphalt etc.) nearby as this will result in inflated temps."
2,"Disappointed, returned","I was looking for a wireless weather station with Atomic Clock and the description and picture was exactly like the one I was replacing that I have had for several years and really liked. When it arrived it did not have the Atomic clock feature and was not the station pictured therefore, I returned it. I was very disappointed!!!!"
4,Chaney instrument Wireless Weather Station and Clock,Chaney instrument Wireless Weather Station and Clock. Don't have any real feedback as this was a gift. No complaints from recipient. Just have to assume it's working satisfactory
3,Not sure if it's accurate,"When I received it, I put the outside transmitter next to the inside receiver. The transmitter was sending a temperature reading that was at least 2 degrees different than what the inside unit was showing. Left them side by side for a couple of days and the two never showed the same temperature."
3,Worth checking out.,"Some of the songs sound the same, and quality isn't the greatest. But worth the price. Take a chance, it doesn't suck."
3,Decent But Not Great,"This 50 minute performance (plus a long, boring, introduction that should have been on the cutting room floor) was recorded on videotape before a live audience. Picture quality could be better, and suffers from what seems to be a poor transfer to DVD. The sound quality is just OK, and the sound balance is poor -- the piano is muffled and always hard to hear, and the balance between the horns isn't as good as it should have been. On the positive side, production values are reasonably good - the camera work is OK and stays focused on the musicians without excessive movement.My impression of the band -- Freddie Hubbard, Wayne Shorter, Curtis Fuller, Cedar Walton, Reggie Workman, and Art -- is that, for the most part, these players hadn't yet matured enough to be interesting soloists. Shorter is the exception, and two of his compositions, new at the time, are featured. If this was the only available video by these artists, I might be more enthusiastic. Thankfully it is not."
4,Guidelines,"This book was a little hard for me to understand at first. Perhaps I need to understand the ""social media"" better. I would recomment this as a possible road to the future of the church along with ""Christianity after Religion""."
2,Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2001,"This game is a let down from the start. Your choices are limited to only three golf courses and six professional golfers. The only worse golf game than this was Tiger Woods for the N64 platform. The graphics are the only plus for this game and the credit for that should probably be given to Sony. The gameplay is much more advanced than Tiger 99 for PS1, that could be due to the lack of information that is given to the golfer on the lie of the ball or the grossly exagerated grid of the green. I wish I had never bought this game and I would trade it in if I were to get more than $25 from the local store. Save some money and buy either Links or Microsoft Golf for your PC."
2,NOT WORTH THE HYPE,I have been playing EA GOLF since the SEGA GENISIS. EA SPORTS has forgotten that graphics are nice but quickly get old. Game play is what makes a game as fun again and again. Here is a list of the problems. 1. you should have the option of using the buttons instead of the analog stick 2. not enough courses to choose from 3. in general using the analog joysticks doesn't work 4. for whatever reason you chunk pitch shots unless right on the green 5. it won't show you the grid of the green when you are chipping
3,Not a bad start...,"Ever since the introduction of the Playstation to the world of video gaming, I've been searching for a console golf game that would rival the fun and satisfaction I had playing PGA Golf II and III for the old Sega Genesis. Sad to say I've been greatly disappointed thus far.Tiger Woods golf for the PS2 is pretty solid. This was my first foray into the 'Tiger Woods' series of golf and I have to say I was somewhat surprised. I enjoyed the new swing meter (you use the analog stick to control the meter) and the graphics are very good. However, I felt like the accuracy of the shots (i.e. distance relative to club selection and weather situations) was somewhat questionable. I was also very disappointed in the fact that there are so few courses and players to select from.In all, this was an enjoyable game, but not as enjoyable as, say Links 2000 for the PC. Hopefully EA will rectify these problems for 2002."
2,Lacking...,"What a shame! I had high hopes for PGA 2001. Unfortunately, EA spent a lot of time (and money) motion capturing Tiger and not enough time re-creating courses. Surely, something with the potential that the PS2 has could have handled more than 3 courses, at the very least give me some variety. TPC at Sawgrass anyone? I really did like the use of the analog sticks to swing, that's one of the nice aspects of this game. However, I expected a lot more depth from the company that released Madden 2001, no season, no stats, no MONEY? It's ironic that the much-maligned ""Swing Away Golf"" has more detail & depth than a PGA licensed product. Rent it, or buy mine when I take it to the used video game store."
4,Pretty good game,"The best golf game i ever played. Graphics were good. There just wasn't anyone else for me to play against that made it a challenge. 3 courses and a bunch of different modes kept me busy for a while. My biggest complaint is noise. Not enough. Unless there's someone else in the room talking, it can get errily quiet. The only other thing was i thought it was to easy to control ball flight, and it didn't present much of a challenge. Still worth the money though. Might want to rent it first."
3,"The release was rushed, and features suffered","If I had it to do all over again, I probably wouldn't buy this game. Play is cumbersome using the analog sticks, and the players often chunk a shot several times a round for no reason (yeah, like these guys would do that). There's only 3 courses, all from the Monterey peninsula - good courses, but variety would be better - maybe throw in a desert course or a TPC. PGA Tour and Tournament modes are nothing like a real PGA event, and as far as I can tell there is no ""season"" with money standings, etc. A Ryder Cup points competition would be cool, but that isn't there either. Also, why not let me create my own player like I can do in Madden? Graphics are good, but player motion is way better in the PC version. Putting is a challenge, which is good. EA Sports usually puts out winners, but this isn't one of their better efforts."
3,Incomplete but still good,"For as long as it took for this game to come out I thought it would be more complete. What I mean is the game isnt as full as I expected. The new swing is alright to use and it is a challenge but I wish they would have included an option to use the old 3 click swing meter. And also I cant believe they only included 3 courses. The courses are fun and a challenge but for [the cost] I would think they would have atleast included 5 courses. Also you cant keep individule stats you can keep records but not your stats. The graphics are excellent and the game is a real challenge and lots of fun. Another thing the game is missing is a driving range, putting green and chip shots for practice. EA Sports could have done alot better considering how long it took to get this game to market. But that ok next year is coming maybe they can do better then."
1,not strong,"this game doesnt compare to the the pc golf games. the graphics are nice but the game play is awful. Be able to control the ball flight once in the air with a draw or fade is so cheesy. Also their is no choice for courses(which i am sure they will release later to sucker you in to spending more money). Also there are only 4 or 5 golfers th choose from. the worst is that its keeps no stats on avg drive distance. putts per green, Moniey won etc. If you want a good golf game get links 2001 for the pc"
1,They can definitly do better,"3 courses...thats all. Not enough options for OTHER golfers. I played the Tiger Pga for PS1, and I like that one. But this one was just not enough for me. The fact that I was REQUIRED to use the analog didnt appeal to me. I prefer to use the X button to hit the ball. The graphics were great, but in the end I was very disappointed."
5,Great Game,This game is graphically great. The 3 courses is the only bad spot in this game. The three courses they do have are 3 of the funnest courses and they never get boring. The selection of golfers is good. The game's graphics are the best part. Tiger looks so realistic. This is great game. For the real first golf game it is spectacular
4,A new love for the slowest game in sports,"As an owner of the last Tiger Woods on PS, my love first began then. Late nights turning to early mornings with a gang of friends who don't know how to go home at a decent hour. Tiger Woods PGA Tour is causing the same affect as the last. 6 friends gathering after work for a game of golf and they don't leave to go home until 3 or 4 a.m. This game has it all as far I'm concern when it comes to golf for a video game. None of us has ever picked up a club before but got madd skills when it comes to Tiger Woods PGA Tour. Graphics are much better and I love how this version makes you think more about what clubs to choose, chips verses punches and pitches, grass shots verses green shots. This is a must have for any golf head or those who wants to get a better understanding of golf.oNe"
5,An affordable general guide to the history of the MG,"Although Mr. Heilig doesn't get much into what to look for when purchasing an MG,( I would have liked more information on what problems or benefits to look for on certain years and models) he does give a clearly written history of the MG, and for those who are considering buying one, this is as good as any place to start. I brought my first MGB over a month ago, and found a picture of my same year and color on page 61. That most of the pictures are in color was a great incentive to purchase the book, and it was affordable too."
4,Bryson City Seasons,"Very good! Really good for older readers who can appreciate the memories/stories of a young doctor ,husband, and father practicing in the N. C. Mountians. I recommend this book---as well as the first one---Bryson City Tales"
2,Well-Compiled But Shallow Biography,"This is a very well-compiled but shallow biography about a great compiler who was himself shallow because he was too blocked from going deep within. Grosskurth gets all the facts of Havelock Ellis's life in order but fails synthesize them, and thus cannot grasp his essence. My feeling is that she misses the point so badly, and can't connect the dots of information she shares about Havelock Ellis, because she hasn't connected the dots in her own life. And if she'd done so in herself I can't imagine she would have had much interest in devoting YEARS of her life attemping to sort out this Havelock Ellis character, who, sadly, is not the world's most interesting or important creature."
5,Truely revealing,"This is the best resource for a study on the ""Jezebel Spirit"" that I have ever come across. You will be suprised at how the pieces fit, when you begin to study on this subject."
4,kateland,"I have been spirted away to a far off place. Im somewhere deep in bushland, and standing beside a very large wide creek, That has running blue water and white water. The flowing water is just sparkling. I can see a waterfall in the distance, and hear the sweet sounds of birds. This is truely a wonderful sight. This is total isolation. Its just ME and NATURE. I feel very relaxed and happy. And i never want to leave this magical place. But i know that i can return again, whenever i wish. For total relaxtion, VISIT THE CREEK."
4,Easy Take-a-long,I am enjoying my 'non-tech' auto bridge. It meets my needs perfectly at a price I can afford. I don't even need batteries. I can take it with me easily and practice my bridge skills. I am new at bridge and the enclosed booklet helps me learn new things and confirms the things I've learned in each hand. It's easy to use and helpful.
5,Stunning,"Not only a very entertaining film, but a realistic view of WW2 from the Allie new Zealands point of viewSuper acting, especially Paul Newman and Jean Simmons!an insight into the futility of war."
3,Acceptable,"It sometimes jams. Is easy to get dirty, hard and a bit delicate to clean. Container is under it, so it means you need at least 1/4 of it to work easily, and still it sometimes does blotches on your work, which is completely unacceptable."
4,The Truth About Teratogens,"This book is a terrifying and fascinating thriller that weaves a seductive mystery about the history about one of the best known teratogens: Thalidomide. This book explores one of the first incidents that prompted the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, a program which seeks to identify anomaly inducing substances. It also outlines events that prompted the FDA to be considerably more discerning about the level of testing that goes into approving these drugs. 'Dark Remedy' brings a drug with a dark past back into the limelight as a drug with vast potential to change lives for the better. Well written and easy to read this book avoids medical jargon making it a perfect chioce for the layperson seeking to educate themselves about this tragedy. Although these children suffered, two things redeem the situation"
3,Didn't live up to my expectations,"Dark Remedy is definitely not all it's cracked up to be. I agree that it's a disturbing and informative book chronicling the ""life"" of thalidomide but I have to admit that I found it pretty boring. Maybe I'm just too young to understand the tragedy that resulted from the use of thalidomide. The truth is that I had never even heard of thalidomide until I read this book. I guess I can't truly grasp the impact that this drug had on the world and that may have contributed to the confusion I experienced while reading Dark Remedy. The only parts of the book that I found interesting were the experiences of the children who were born with phocomelia. That is what I was looking for when I first decided to read this book. I guess I should have looked elsewhere."
5,Colorful Cooking!,I bought this because I loved the color. What I was not expecting how easy it is to use and clean. I use it to bake my chicken and veggies. It is not that heavy so my older mother-in-love can use it. I put it right in the dishwashier. It cleans very well. My husband uses it to serve hot wings. Wonderful shape and super easy to store.
3,Great book with second-rate printing,"The book is a pleasure to read, and I recommend it to anyone who is learning analysis. However, this version is xeroxed from a used copy of the 1969 corrected printing. For the most part it is attractive enough and it is almost always clear enough to read, but there are a few pages with xeroxed pen marks or page-edge lines, a few where the text is slightly distorted, and worst of all a few that are actually difficult to read because of how badly they were copied. I recommend it only if you can get it very cheap."
2,Don't trust the company.,"The same company put out a paperpack edition of this book that is also for sale on Amazon, and it is horrible. It was photocopied, badly, from an obviously used copy. They don't let you preview either one, and after having bought the other one I see the reason. Unless you have seen a hard copy of this exact printing to verify that it isn't a sham, do not buy this book.However, I do like the book. Hopefully a legitimate reprinting will come out.(I would appreciate comments and corrections from someone who has this printing.)"
2,Not what I wanted,"i should have read the description more clearly...this is partially vocal, not all instrumental. Nothimg wrong with the CD, but I only like instrumental."
3,Off Limits,"This is a Bob Hope movie that features a bit part by Charles Bronson. THat's why I bought the movie. This movie had a rather grainy appearance when I watched it and I actually found a better copy somewhere else. So pay attention to the film company that produced the tape. Some do a better job than others. I do believe that this film is out of print and unless you record the movie from TCM or other similar classic movie channel, you'll have to settle for VHS."
5,Art at its best!!,Absolutely wonderful music! I recommend this recording highly! The most moving works represented were provided by Philadelphia composer Robert Maggio and New Yorker Lee Hoiby.
4,El Espíritu del Renacimiento,"Sir John Smith's Almain, pieza con la cual comienza el disco nos resume la idea básica del Renacimiento tanto en Inglaterra como en el resto de Europa. En dicha composición (como en el resto) se encuentran los razgos más característicos: repetición y parafraseo de los motivos en diferentes intesidades y compases. ¡Bienvenidos!"
3,Not Beginer Signing,I am a beginer at sign and did not know the diference between ASL and Signed English. This book has simple Illistrations that are fun and chalanging. I purchesed it to learn to sign nursry rhymes for my 18mo. son. I quit using this book because I was unable to remember the signs very well. Now I am using video to learn the signs first. My son enjoys the pictures and I will learn the signs then the rhymes later. A good book but not for beginers.
3,mystery,"Someone who has this book, please list the nursery rhymes that are included in it. I don't know why editor's book reviews for books with multible contents don't list the titles included."
3,Gay pride taken to absurdity,"A compilation with no purpose, pasted together (tastefully) from slices of other great CRI releases. Is this supposed to have educational value? Shock value? Wouldn't you rather hear Cowell paired with, say, an openly hetero Charles Ives? Or a complete epic Partch work? Or an entire CD of Cage's Sonatas & Interludes? None of these composers made being gay central to their musical identities. I doubt if they would have done so even in the present era. What next? The Greatest Throbbing Hits of Tchaikovsky? The secret gay composer, artist or poet was no secret to his patrons, friends & most dedicated fans. He even enjoyed certain advantages,At least the ""lesbian"" series showcases lesser known women composers who would never have gotten past the hunky bouncer at a Virgil Thomson tea party in 1950."
4,Definitely not your mama's Atkins,"You know, I really don't like Pigface. However, this album was in the used section of the local CD emporium, and because I recognized the names of Atkins and Ogilvy, and decided to give it a trial spin in the store. Amazing! Who would have thought that such diverse, complex tunes could come from these people? This stuff is dangerously contagious. It fits like a puzzle piece into my collection of exotic electronic, right along with FSOL, NIN, and Coil. I honestly think that this album's page should have links to it from more places in Amazon than it does, because it deserves the recognition. Also, the album cover needs to be shown on its page, because it's cool and if it wasn't for that I'd have never even picked it up (yeah, so I'm shallow). I reckon that people who don't even know it exists would seriously dig it. I know I do."
3,Would have been a great second CD in a Skinny Puppy 2 CD set,"Bedside Toxicology is the outtakes to the Process, whether anyone wants to admit it or not. The creative differences that cEvin Key cited after the Process are in full force here but the album as a whole is kind of weak. Too many filler songs. If you are a fan of SP you will want to own it to complete your collection."
4,Damn fine album,"It lacks the depth and layering of skinny puppy, and some of the tracks are a bit weak, but overall a very good album. The last half of the album is probably the weaker part, which is a bit of a downer since it diminishes your desire to listen to the album as a whole.So, I'd give it 4.2 stars. Oh yah, and the decision to open with Scarecrow is pure genius."
3,ohGr's side project!,Not much to talk about this album. some songs have the skinny puppy flaver...some dont!!! if you ask me i think it dont have enough energy.
5,Amazing,"This is an absolutely brilliant collection of live radio performances from 1942 when a very young but already masterful Frank Sinatra was singing with Tommy Dorsey's band. None of this was meant to survive past the night it was performed. Fortunately for us, these fragments got recorded, the fragile disks preserved and now, nearly 70 years later, we are treated to one of the finest examples of early Sinatra existing. Of course, those acetate disks have a lot of pop and hiss, but the engineers have done a great job at reducing that. As for the silverware and chatter in the background complained about by an earlier reviewer: that was actually part of the background at the time. These shows were recorded live at various venues where people were eating and drinking and those sounds add wonderfully to the atmosphere. I love this disk and play it over and over. Buy it while you can!"
3,"Well, really three and a half stars!","I have read all of Sue Margolis' books, and while I enjoyed this one, it just wasn't as engaging as her other novels.In this book we find our heroine Cynthia Fishbein attending therapy because she just isn't able to stand up for herself. Along the way, we meet her two best friends, Hugh and Harmony, we meet her many colorful work colleagues (as well as a frisky, foul-mouthed myna bird) and her loving family. Interspaced between this, she falls in love has a crisis at work, then a crisis with her new love, then another crisis at work, and then....all is well.Many people, myself included, want a happy ending with a romance novel, but I must say I just had a hard time getting into this book. However, the characters were engaging, and I laughed out loud more than once.Give this book a go-round, but look at Margolis' other books as well, especially Apocolipstick. Very funny!"
3,Not Sinful,"It took me about half of this book to even get into the characters. Cyn, the main character, is a weak pleasing girl that is always getting walked on. She finally finds her backbone (by accident) and then the story takes off a bit. She takes over another girls personality to run an ad campaign and finds a boy in therapy class that she loves (and isn't suppose to date). Slightly entertaining but not what I was expecting."
3,Meh- Ok for a library pick,"So this book seemed like fun and since I had gotten it on a clearance rack it wasn't a big deal. Some of the characters (ok all of them) were crazy and over the top but I read for escape not to meet up with characters that I encounter in real life. It was silly, fluffy and the characters self indulgent but keep in perspective the genre in which the book is written it is not high literary prose but that doesn't make it bad. If you are looking for a fun book and don't mind detaching from reality give it a shot."
1,Disappointed,"According to the intro at the back cover, it sounded really interesting. I thought it would be really funny and with excitment. However, to my disappointment, I could hardly believe I finished the whole book. I was about to give up after the second chapter. I have never read a book this boring. The storyline in the book is very fragile. Talking about someone stole her identity was just a slightly touch. The main story lies on her strugle with the wedding of her younger brother. There were too many unnecessary subplots and it made you go insane. You really do not see why and how these subplots fit into the book or how it made a difference in Cyn (the main character) who just stole someone's identity. I think this book is really a crap. Don't be fooled...."
4,Bite-sized info for parents,"I was happy to see these new selections from Gryphon House because they take MaryAnn Kohl's books and break them down into bite-sized pieces. While some projects may be familiar to teachers, it is wonderful to have someone like MaryAnn Kohl put them all together, add a little twist, add her own innovations, and give them to us in book form. You may think that it's easy to think up 100's of project ideas until you give it a try... but then you'll want this book so you won't have to! I've seen MaryAnn teach in workshops and she is wonderful. This comes across in her projects. She truly loves kids and wants them to be creative!"
4,The 4 dogs love them,They are a good buy my dog love them there are a lot of small pic they give 4 pic extra
4,Good ears for the price,"I bought these cow ears for my 10-month-old labrador retriever. They are a lower-calorie and lower-fat alternative when compared with pig's ears. My dog loves them! Some of them are larger than others, and they are not huge, but the majority of them are good-sized. They may not be as big as the ones I get at the pet store, but I pay 50% to 100% more for those than I did for these. I think that for the price, they were excellent."
2,"My 6 year old liked this, Guess I should work on her taste","If you have read the books, and (although not quite Potter-class) they are quite good, this movie should be a let down. Mis-cast, dumbed-down and full of plot holes, I thought ""well, so much for a promising franchise."" Now I hear they are making another. I hope it is better."
3,Introducing...,"""Percy Jackson..."" is a fantasy movie directed at middle school and high school age students. Percy, a modern day high schooler, has to adjust to being the half-divine son of a god at the same time he is accused of stealing an important artifact. Without the artifact, the ancient Greek gods will return and will begin a war. (Based on the series of books by Rick Riordon).This featurette introduces you to the making of the movie. A decent intro to the movie, but not essential and not a lot different from other ""The making of..."" films."
2,I wanted more,"I love Tye Tribbett & GA. They did a wonderful job on Victory. Not sure about much of the material on here, but you did bless me with I Still Have Joy. Can't wait for the next cd, wish this cd had more on it that worked with the vein of Victory."
3,NOT THAT GOOD,"WASSUP YALL. THIS ALBUM IS NOT THAT GOOD. IT'S ALRIGHT. THE ONLY GOOD SONGS ARE ""VICTORY"", ""BLESS THE LORD"", ""SINKING"", ""STILL HAVE JOY"" AND ""EVERYTHING"". THAT IS IT. AND MAYBE ""NO OTHER CHOICE"". I WAS EXCITED WHEN I BOUGHT THIS CD CAUSE I HEARD THAT IT WAS GOOD BUT IT IS NOT. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. I DONT LIKE THE ROCK SONG. THE WHOLE CD DIDNT FLOW RIGHT. TYE U COULD HAVE DONE BETTER."
3,Disappointed,"The last album is the best of the two. Now you have some cuts up there that's alright, but it aint like the first one. Dont get me wrong The musicians do tha thang, but for people to wait as long as we did, it could have been more fire that what it was."
4,Add this CD to your collection,"I can't believe what the review below me says... the devil is a liar lol j/k, but seriously this is a good cd. I love the songs ""I Want It All Back"" ""Victory Check"" and ""Victory"" to dance and really sing and get into, but then there is songs like ""Sinking"" where the lyrics really make you think and minister to you if you pay attention. I also believe "" Look Up"" should have been a full song and not an interlude... i felt like I was being teased lol. "" Everything will be alright"" is also a great song to listen to for someone who is going through or having one of those days when things just seem to be going wrong. Oh yea also ""Seated At The Right Hand of God"" grew on me... once you actually listen to the lyrics of that song there is no way you can't rejoice when thinking about Jesus. This cd is great and if you don't have it I would definitely buy it."
2,Way Overrated,"Out of this whole CD, I could only pick about 3 songs that I liked. This CD is very disappointing and some of the songs were down right annoying. The best songs on here are Everything Part I, II/ Bow Before The King and Victory. Past those songs, there is not much because I can't bear to listen to the rest. Those two songs get 1 star each."
3,Good,"This Album is not as good as his old album life; but still a good album. The album is not great and not bad at all but it was just good.I was hoping for a little bit more on the album. I read articles on how they had mary mary perform and other big events that happened in the actual recording but was left out of the album. I was just wanting more from this album. The Gems on the album are Always win, Victory and Everything."
3,Defintely not what I expected,"This album is defintely not what they advertise. The album has a tradional choir feel to it. The ony song that has a ""neo"" feel to it is the interlude ""Look Up"" (which shoulda been a whole song. I expected a high energy next level type of sound. When you see and hear what he's done in his performances (i downloaded this song called ""I walk by faith"" its very different; i expected something like that. But none the less this album has a full choir sound with tradional music. It was a total let down from what I expected, but if your into that sound this is the album for you."
3,NOT THE BEST,I HAVE GOT BETTER CD OF TYE TRIBBETT AND I DO NOT THINK THIS WAS HIS BEST I AM NOT ALL THAT PLEASE WITH THE CD.
2,What happened?,"I, like other reviewers, was really disappointed with this album from Tye Tribbett. I thought it came up short compared to his CD Life. I would fast forward through each song hoping that the next one would be better. With the exception of maybe two songs, it never got better. This was definitely not what I expected from Tye and G.A."
4,Great for studying digestion and nutrition,"This game will help bring home how the digestive system works and how the food you eat affects you. It also has some great activities and experiments to try at home (like eating with chopsticks, napkin folding, drinking upside down, counting peas...).The graphics are pleasing and we didn't run into any programming errors. The game design is simplistic but the kids love it and were able to complete it without aid from us.The age range says 6 and older however kids older than 8 or 9 will not find this game dynamic enough and will become easily put out."
1,Disappointed,"The narrator in this CD has a British/cockney accent and speaks quite fast. It was difficult for me to understand so it never made it under the tree. For example, the word ""uvula"" is pronouced ""uvuler"". Other than that, it's difficult to use, and is not as educational as I thought it would be. It's more like a game, and a frustrating one, because some of the links to click on lead to the same ""action"", song, or description, which gets quite tedious. I was reluctant to click on a page more than once and there are numerous ""buttons"" on each page. The art is interesting for an adult, but too busy for children."
5,Charming collection,"This is a collections of less known, but beautiful pieces of Czech piano classics. If you are interested in Czech music or if you like piano miniatures you'll love it. However, this is magnificient performance with deep understanding of musical speech of Dvorak, Janacek, Fibich, Dussek and others... Antonin Kubalek at his artistic peak shows to everyody, that he is the leader in Czech piano interpretation."
3,Good Resource: Needs Update,"This is good resource for those planning to teach a communications workshop; however, it was written in 1995 prior to the proliferation of email and other communication, such as IM and mobile phones. With that being said, the rules of communication have not changed, but the tools for communicating have changed a lot since the mid-1990s. While I have taught semester long communication courses, I have never taught a one-day workshop, so this will come in handy as I develop a training session for one-day classes."
4,Interesting collection of Techno-Rave music,"The totality of this 2 CD set is that it is good. Some really good songs on it, but most of them are sounding kind of old at the time of writing this. Despite the fact that the listing says Lords of Acid only a couple of songs are by them. The CDs in this set would sound best in a club setting with the volume set to overkill. It's what it is designed for. I don't reccomend this if you play your music at low volumes, but if you don't have a lot of Techno-Industrial or Rave music this would be a good buy to add to your collection. Worth the Money."
3,A few good tracks but...,This CD could have had some faster tunes on it. There are very few rave tracks on it. It's more of a trance CD then dance or rave. I wasn't real impressed.
3,OK,"I guess I should have liked this book better because I did pass the test with it, or maybe it was all the material I looked at. I found that the real test differs quite a bit from this.The questions in this book seem to be very easy compared to the real test. I expected to do better BECAUSE I used this book but not in the bilingual section. My real saver was Math which I already knew, Social Studies, and Science. (For which I had taken the classes)Not that excited about this book."
1,Principals of Color,The book Principals of Color has not yet arrived at the given address in Brazil. It is impossible to review this book at this time.
5,A++++++,"If you only own one JBT CD, this is the one to have. This was the era when the band was at its musical peak and before it went into a poppier direction."
5,How did this get by me?,"Friends of mine and I have been bellyaching about this material not getting reissued. Well, it did get reissued while we were looking for it all on parent labels.These nonpareil presentations of three of Mennin's masterworks have been praised to the skies again and again, so my pipsqueaking isn't worth listening to. But the disk is, and I'm relieved that when my LPs go, I can fall back on this CD waiting in the wings in my collection. It doesn't concede very much to the LPs in sound and it perpetuates the memory of a compelling composer that we lost way too early.Add Hanson's Mercury reading of the 5th Symphony to these and you truly have a treasure chest for yourself on just two disks."
1,poor design,"I purchased a tee ball set like this to play with my son. The cross design of the base ended up wobbly, and worse it would even stand upright at all after a short period of time. He was very sad."
1,Worst Tee ball set EVER!! Its not made to hit the tee!,"What kind of tee ball set falls apart everytime you hit it?? Didn't the manufacturers think about the fact that little kids without good coordination might occassionally hit the tee instead of the ball??It didn't just fall apart in less than 10 minutes of play, it broke into pieces! By far the worst purchase I've made!"
4,quite brilliant,"I read this book 2.5 years ago, but just decided to pick it up again for a re-read. I loved the development of fictional countries and language. I also looked the footnotes on the bottom of the pages for further information to the story. In regards to the invented language, there were times when I had to go to the back of the book for the Efica - English translation and there was none. The times I could figure the translation out on my own it was included in the translation dictionary. Oh well. Ovreall, it was a fun read."
2,Certainly not Carey's best,"Oscar and Lucinda is one of my all-time favourite books. When I picked up this one, I expected a similar style of writing. Maybe it's because the world Carey has created here is too detached from my own familiarity that I could not fully relate to the characters. I must admit, however, that Carey's writing does make the reader feel. I had an eery feeling towards the protagonist throughout, but could never sympathize with him. I see in the reviews from others that perhaps this book is best left to Australians who understand something of where Carey is coming from. Usually, I would say that good writing and a good story can cross any cultural boundaries, but maybe this book IS best left to the Aussies. (Even though it's probably arguable that Canada's relationship to the American cultural ""superpower"" is/isn't similar to Australia's relationship to the US.)"
5,thr heptones-leroy sissles-a lost to fame softer secretive bob marley,"the heptones- thee heptone of the heptones was Leroy Sibbles-not so out front as Bob Marley,the Maytals, but softer,more intimate also he crapped out on his band famous because deeper music more moonlit than sunlit of commercialism.Check out what he said"
5,Very useful,"This tool is simple and effective. I have only used it on a few pieces, but it makes clean, easy pocket holes. It only takes a min to set the drill stop to the right depth then you are set. I do not make enough pocket holes to justify the much more expensive kits so this one was perfect for me."
5,"Useful product, good service","This was the same product I'd seen before at Home Depot, so no surprises there. But at Home Depot, it was part of a much more expensive kit. Shipment was quick & well packaged. Well done!"
5,Works like a champ,Inexpensive and simple to use. I made a farm house table and you can't see a single screw thanks to this little guy.
5,A life saver!,"Much easier than trying to line up biscuts, this little tool saved me hours on my built-ins. I highly reccommend this item and using it with a corded drill for anything 3/4"" and over. I used my cordless and had no problems but I think the power of a general consumer cordless drill may not be enough to make a clean hole. I definitly reccommend this liitle jig and bit or move up to the bigger one."
1,Didn't Get It!,"Very disappointed! I ordered this product ""used"" from a seller and just got an email that said it's unavailable and that the amount I paid is being refunded. Very disappointing."
5,Great mix of comics and behind the scenes footage!,I rented this video as I am a huge Sebastian Maniscalco fan. It was filmed as a sort of behind the scenes movie combined with comedy show footage. It gave me a great respect for what a comedian does night after night. Plus it was good to see a few other actors who were also helping these comedians get their start. I found it very entertaining! A must see for any comedy fan!
5,I really liked the movie.,"I recorded this on FIOS one day. I must say I liked it. It was really funny. It kind of shows you comedy from the part of the comedians who are performing it. You kind of get to see Vince Vaughn the actor, while also seeing him for who he really is. For this I thought the movie was fun. I have never heard of any of the comedians in the movie. So it was great to find some new people to make me laugh. It had a real behind the scenes feel. I allways like behind the scenes stuff. I will be buying this for sure. A lot of haters out there. Thus is the life of a comedian. Sucks that I want to be a comedian."
2,"A documentry, not a comedy show","When you look at the cover, and the title, and the description of this DVD, you think you are going to be getting a few comedians doing there show... but instead, there is not enough footage of the show, and more a documentary on the tour that should be a behind the scenes, or life on the road kind of documentary as a bonus feature on a disc of a proper full length comedy show.It seems like this is more Vince Vaughn trying to help a few friends get recognized, and show he is a good Samaritan. But, there is a time and place for those kind of things, you don't really want to see emotional things when you sit down and expect to be entertained with laughter, or who they meet on the road etc...The thing is watchable, there is some good laughs, but it really seems like this should be a bonus feature, and the full show should have been the main feature."
3,BOO WHO?,"BOO is an independent, straight to DVD movie that shows its budget restrictions, but yet there are some scares in the movie and it maintains a pretty creepy atmosphere throughout. The movie is set in an abandoned hospital where five teenagers plan a night of spooky contrived horror. But as in all of these movies, the hospital is really haunted and it isn't long before members of the party are knocked off one by one.While the acting and effects aren't great, they are pretty good considering the budget; the plot has some weird turnarounds and not always probable, but in a horror film like this, a few jolts can make it enjoyable and BOO does have a few."
2,"Boo? More like ""Ha Ha""","Several days ago my roommates went out to rent us a movie to watch, and they brought back ""Boo"". Honestly, I laughed when they told me the title, and I hardly stopped for the rest of the film. The acting was horrible, the plot-line is laughable (and they seem to introduce plot lines then not really follow through with them in the end...), and the special effects, while gory and gross, are clearly done on a budget (not necessarily the worst thing ever, but still a minor deterrent). If you're looking for a ""scary"" movie that you enables you to laugh off all of the moments that make you jump, which there are quite a few of in this film (hense 2 stars instead of 1), then ""Boo"" is for you!"
1,BOO was boring for me,"I read the reviews-thinking it was so good I bought it. I cannot tell how disappointed I was in it. It bored me. I do not like excessive violence and don't even like sex in horror movies, but I do like creative imaginative ones. I found nothing creative or imaginative, and I failed to see what was so entertaining about it. What was so spooky about the abandoned hospital?? I didn't see it. I thought the whole plot and script was just plain drab. And yes I yawned a lot throughout the movie wishing it would get better, and it never did. Maybe for those who raved about the movie, they are easily entertained by whatever is put in front of them???? I don't get it. I thought the movie was DULL big time. Nothing scary.It had a lot of loud noises where there was a ""fright"" scene such as the appearance of a ghost, but never did frighten me. Not once. Just loud noise. I didn't think the acting was good. I was bored with it. Plain and simple. My honest opinion."
4,Pretty good ghost story,"The only things in the negative was that some of the acting wasn't that great, and the ending was a little forced. But, for a low budget film, they did an excellent job in making it creepy. The special effects were top notch. There are a few scares throughout that made me jump or squirm. This one is worth yout time and $$"
3,"Throw ""Sweet Insanity"", ""Madhouse"" and ""See No Evil"" into a blender and pour out ""Boo!""","For a straight-to-dvd, this is not a bad horror movie. It is somewhere between ""Sweet Insanity"", ""Madhouse"" and ""See No Evil"". The acting is pretty bad, but it doesn't detract too much from the story. There are some good special effects here and there, along with some genuine scary parts.The story takes too long to move along and gets confusing when it goes too many places at once. This is especially true towards the end. Trish Coren reminded me a little bit of Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde, which probably isn't the best thing for a horror movie. But, she's cute and with some acting lessons could go places. The same is not true of the rest of the cast. Even flawed, it's worth a rental."
4,Just another teen-coll,"Anytime there are highschool to college students in a horror film, I think you pretty much know what's going to happen. Once always decides to check out a spooky place, a couple splits up from the group to make out, one by one their friends start dying off. The Movie is pretty good, it has some very creepy scense, but you have to keep your eye on the movie. There are things that happen pretty quick in my opinion. it also has Days Of Lives Actress Rachel Melvin who plays Chelsea. This movie is probably what got her started. It's worth seeing."
1,The movie's like a ghost. I don't really believe in it.,"Well, alright, I believe in ghosts, but my stance on Boo remains the same. I was drawn in by the trailer initially, but then you really can't trust trailers nowadays, can you? You can't trust the entire film either. A spooky environment and people covered in blood don't make for a good horror film when the acting is laughable and the script seems to have been thrown together with haste and disregard for quality. If this had comedy deliberately in mind aside from horror, then it acheived its goal. But this is a very ineffectual movie. The term ""it's all been done before"" applies here threefold."
1,"Hey man, your dripping.","This movie was the worst I have ever seen. It made no sense what so ever. Boo! is actually about a dead pedophile who molseted a young girl, and killed her. SO the young girl and the pedophile's spirits haunt a mental hospital. The ghosts can take over bodies, but there is one bad side to this, they melt, and blow up. There is one classic scene where the idiot teens are trying to escape the hospital and one guy gets pissed, so we come to find out he is actually a ghost, he starts to melt, so another guy shoots him, and the dude blows up and covers a girl. (The girl that gets slimed screams the rest of the movie, which I couldn't stand.) DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS HORRID THING!!!"
2,A Sad Mess Filled With Missed Opportunities & Lots Of Potential,"I give this hack job the extra star for the fact that it had some very creepy visuals a handful of jumpy scares & a good idea for a story. How sad is it though when that kind of potential can't crutch the horrible outcome,wich resides in plot-hole central USA,home of the university of bad acting & laughable endings(UBALE). Oh man! Horror fans! ""BOO"" could have been an excellent new low-budget horror flick if it had a tighter script with a much better ending & included some half decent actors who actually had a grip on there character's. All & all what we are left with is an all over the place mess with some good visuals & scares. So many missed opportunities & so much potential lost. What a sad waste!"
3,Not very comfortable,"These are ok for short term wear, but they're not very comfortable. One size really means up to size 10. The lace is not stretchy."
4,"Serious, straight history","There are several rap/hip-hop history books out there, but very few that just give you the straight facts free from press-kit biographies or fan-magazine drivel. This is one of the few really good ones, covering the whole spectrum from the early 1970s block party DJs to the late 1990s mega-industry. Well-informed and informative."
4,This is truly a Power Series,"First of all, I love all of Leslie Sansone's videos and DVDs that I have in my possession. This Power Series that I recently received is excellent. The Power Mile is an energizing 15 minute workout. It is great if you want to get a good workout in a small amount of time. Walk and Jog takes you through a series of walking for three minutes and jogging for three minutes. Leslie knows how to do the transition between the two. Great high impact workout. There is also low impact on the DVD for people who do not want to go high. Walk and Kick is walking and kickboxing intervals. It is a moderate impact exercise and is good if you want to get a good workout, but not work as hard. Great series from Leslie Sansone."
2,It's okay,"This series is okay as an add on after a more intense workout. My main complaint is the low intensity. I thought that the walk jog would be a great one to work up a sweat but it really wasn't. I also thought the backround music was very difficult to hear and I personally need to hear that music-it's motivating for me. Leslie's voice however comes through very loud which may be why the music seems so low. The backrounds themselves are kind of cheesey, but I can live with that. I enjoy the express series much more than this one. It is more of an intense workout, large groups of enthusiastic people and you can hear the music, so you can ""walk to that beat"" as Leslie likes to say."
1,Not what I expected,"I've never tried any Sansone workouts before so I picked these up to give it them a try. The power mile was so low energy that I didn't even feel as though I was exercising. The walk/jog made me break a sweat, albeit a small one, and didn't really get my heartrate into an aerobic range. As stated before, the sets are cheesy and the music is low. Most of all, at the end of the walk/jog workout Sansone says that you've walked 2.5 miles. My pedometer measure just 1 mile - now my pedometer may be off some, but no way is it off by over 50%! I don't know think I'll be trying anymore of the WATP exercises."
4,Lightweight moisturizer,"This is one of the most natural and non-toxic belly rubs you can find. Has a light natural scent, goes on very smoothly and absorbs quickly...not at all greasy like most belly rubs. The 8 oz bottle goes very quickly!"
2,Smelly..,"I bought the oil and also the cream. The texture and the consistence of the products are really good, but the smell is strong and not pleasant."
5,Must Have!,"With our first pregnancy and being ever-so-mindful of the experience, one of my girlfriends recommended Earth Mama Angel Baby products. She uses them for her son (and family) as they use cloth diapers and have certain skin and food allergies.The body butter is just heavenly! I use it after the shower and as I climb into bed. The scent is so soft and subtle that it doesn't linger, but gives you a fresh moment. I haven't had any stretch marks or too tight of skin, but I think that's partially b/c I got in the habit of applying the body butter before my belly started growing.I even got my husband to use the body butter at the house b/c it truly moisturizes and doesn't have the ""girly"" frangrance. So his rough hands aren't so rough any more....which makes for a better back rub. =) I highly recommend EMAB products! You truly won't be disapppointed."
5,Love it!,I love this product. I wish there was a little more of it but I've been very pleased. It's rich and creamy and moisturizes all day.
4,Great lotion!,"This product has a very nice fragrance and doesn't leave you feeling super greasy after you use it. It will definitely kill any itch you have from your growing belly and will leave your skin felling nice and smooth. Don't buy it as a stretch mark prevention because it won't do that but it will keep your skin from drying and becoming irritated. Also I love the fact that its all natural, that's always an upside!"
3,Earth Mama Body Butter,I like this product. I just wish it was thicker because I feel like it is just like any other lotion.
3,"Nice lotion, but it goes fast!","I won't be buying this again, only because it is so expensive! But if the price were lower, I'd use it again -- it's a nice lotion with a subtle smell that didn't irritate my skin."
2,just ok,"I bought this product because I use the baby bottom balm and absolutely love it! It works great on diaper rash. I like the natural ingredients Earth Mama uses. However, this lotion is not really what I expected. It's not as rich and creamy as I hoped. And I'm not thrilled with the way it smells. I read the other reviews and thought they were being too picky. But, it really does smell like cheap, old lady lotion."
2,Sting like Bubble Gum.,I read reviews and some People said Smell like organic something. but I only can smell Cheap Bubble Gum.The lotions okay just don't like smell.
2,gross smell,"I got this product after being so annoyed with the smell of the Palmer's stretch mark cream. I wanted something with more natural ingredients as well. While it does have that, I expected the smell to be more pleasant. Although it is slightly better than the Palmer's smell, it still is gross to me. I guess just a personal preference."
5,My Daughter Loved it & Said Look Mom No Stretch marks again!,My Daughter used this and Burt's Bee's and made it through 2 pregnancies with no stretch marks! I did research before buying this and read other reviews and found out that this was the most natural and didn't have any unhealthy chemicals! She loved this as well as other Earth Mama Products!
2,Too bland for me,"I really get into Celtic design and don't find these stencils at all useful. They're too broad and undefined. I'm glad the other reviewers liked them more. I strongly recommend other Dover books for use with this or, even better, to make your own stencils:Celtic Designs for Artists and Craftspeople CD-ROM and Book (Dover Electronic Clip Art)Celtic Designs and Motifs (Dover Pictorial Archive)Twelve Celtic Bookmarks (Dover Bookmarks)Celtic Design Coloring Book (Dover Design Coloring Books)Celtic and Old Norse Designs (Dover Pictorial Archive)Celtic Charted Designs (Dover Embroidery, Needlepoint)Celtic Art: The Methods of Construction (Dover Art Instruction)Celtic and Old Norse Designs (Dover Pictorial Archive)Celtic Iron-on Transfer Patterns (Dover Iron-On Transfer Patterns)As you can see, Dover has other books to use Celtic designs in drawing, coloring, stitching, iron-on patchwork or sewing. And this is only a fraction of what they have."
3,Decorating time!,I got this cause I wanted to decorate an old denim jacket. The abstract stencils helped me get lots of ideas for the project.
3,ecomusica,"Nice chillout music...some are better than others. but if you like electronica, this is a pretty good one."
5,Chill Out de qualidade,"Raul nasceu em Porto Rico e estudou em Berklee. Sua música é composta de texturas viajantes e belas harmonias, configurando um album perfeito de lounge music. Qualidade total."
3,has some good stuff,If you want to hear BOA at its best buy Raunch and Roll. Easily one of the best hard rock bands of all time but they never were captured well on disc. This album has a few good tunes and Jim Dandy is still Jim Dandy.
1,"Great quality sound, but useless without WMP 10","Microsoft and it's attempt to enforce DRM by insisting that all music devices use MTP transfer protocol (meaning you must use Windows Media Player version 10, which also means you have XP, maybe Vista) have rendered what would undoubtedly have been a great little player practically useless. Don't think you can easily flash the firmware either. Samsung has bowed to M$ pressure and modified the firmware that used to be available on their global downloads so that you cannot simply grab one of those, flash and use as described by some other reviewers. If you have XP, and WMP 10 and don't mind using it to transfer your files instead of simply drag-and-drop, by all means buy this. Otherwise, look for that Plays for Sure logo, and run away from it!"
3,Overcomming Microsoft's Restriction On This Product,"Microsoft has forced Samsung to remove OGG playback and normal flash drive capability for this product from its United States server's firmware downloads. So, unless you happen to run Windows with Media Player 10+, you'll need to grab firmware from Australia in order to use this product. That aside, it's a nice player with great sound and easy access buttons... Yet another reason to back away from Microsoft."
5,WINDOWS 7 FOR DUMMIES BOOK +DVD BUNDLE,I BOUGHT THIS BUNDLE FOR MY HUSBAND & HE IS PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS. GREAT SERVICE & ON TIME .I RECOMMEND BUYING THROUGH AMAZON EVERY TIME. THANK YOU AMAZON . PATRICIA
2,ineffective,"I purchased this book with the expectation that it could give me simple instruction from simple questions. For example, I needed to know the procedure for uploading a photo from my desktop into a selling format on EBay. Couldn't do it until I called in the U.S. Marines. My grandaughter is a Lieutenant and she was able to do it. As far as I am concerned, I wasted my money. Unless of course you would give me a refund?"
5,Excellent,"For those that need a little help in learning W7, this is the book and dvd to have. A good leaning tool."
2,Windows 7 with dvd,The dvd is a waste of money. The letters are hard to read in the Microsoft windows. The book has the same problem. The printer should have used a darker color when they printed the Microsoft Windows or give every one a magnifying glass. On page 194 it said go to the control panel and click system and security and click the windows firewall icon. There is no system and security only system. The firewall icon is alone.
2,Very Disappointed,Previous books that I purchased by Andy Rathbone were excellent and detailed.In this book the pictures are extremely faint and the font is extremely small.Hard to see.System descriptions are minimal.Seems like important things are left out. EX: no explanation of Disk Cleanup or how to get there.I have not used the DVD yet so I can't comment on it.Overall..very disappointed.I'll look for another source the next time I need a computer info book.Amazon Shipping as usual just great !!!
3,windows 7 for dummies,"O.K. but no ""GLOSSARY"" .Index not very good(you must read the whole book to find out where things are) Not very good as a reference Guide.."
4,Wow,Problem with being a Mac person in a Windows world is we are forced at times to go to the dark side. Andy Rathbone had helped make it through the minefields but not without scars. Microsoft has rewarded Andy's patient with Windows 7. One can read the thrill in the pages of this book. No longer having to apologize there is eagerness in the explanations. Between the book and DVD Windows 7 will be fun to learn.
5,Good starter book and DVD.,I recommend this book and DVD for the average person who are looking for the first time at this. It is not highly technical but is very helpful to amatures.
3,review of windows 7 for dummies,this is a basic help book. However I think it is a god place for someone to start reading about Windows 7. I will purchase a more detailed book to learn more of the inner workings of windows 7
4,Windows 7 For Dummies,I found this book to be very helpful. It is especially helpful for someone that has not had very much experience using Windows 7.
5,Window's 7 for Dummies with DVD,I love the book and Dvd set not a bad buy at all I am glad I have the book that way if we run into a problem with how to work windows 7 I have the book to help Thanks alot I am glad I buoght it
2,Winows 7 For Dummies IS Really For Dummies,Don't waste your money on this book. There is hardly any new information in it to help you with Win7. Almost all of the information is for Win XP and Vista and there is little or none that applies to Win7. It probably tells you what you already know.
3,Into each life some Windows 7 must fall,"Into each life some Windows 7 must fall, but Win7 for Dummies sure helps overcome that trauma!. Just wish it had more info on dealing with Hot Mail and Word. Having this ""Dummies"" book is somewhat liker having an experienced friend at your elbow while you're getting somewhat used to Win7 and its associated applications. Just wish it had a more extensive (i.e. helpful) index."
3,Easy readng,this dummy should found the book handy: it explaied some of what I couldnt figure out in a ease to understand format
4,windows 7,Typical dummies book provides a hands on view of the ouirks of the O/S.six more words required. one two
4,Newbe,"My Mother gave be a laptop for christmas with windows 7 so Iam learning,it is helpfulbut I was also hopeing for a little more help on what all the different keys do"
3,It's okay,It's okay. Haven't learned a lot that I didn't already know. It'll be good to have this book as a reference.
4,Worked for me,Being that I have no formal training on computers and changing from Windows XP to 7 this book is really helpful. Sometimes I have to read it a couple times to follow but eventually I get it. Thanks for this book. And love the video coming with it.
4,Windows 7 for Dummies,"New computer for Christmas, and this book has been extremely helpful. We have not used internet before, have never had a digital camera until now, and are getting old. It's an easy reference. Easy to order from Amazon, shipped as they said it would be."
4,Pleased with Windows 7 for Dummies,I'm new to Windows 7 and found this book to be quite helpful. I would recommend it to folks new to Windows 7.
5,windows 7 book,boy has this book been extremely helpful to me i use it almost every day compared to the non existent operators manuals for the various programs i run on my new lap top it's like a bible to me previously have had to do alot of searching the web to get the basic information i've needed it arrived quickly and was in excellent condition
3,The index so inadequate...,"that I can't find what I'm looking for...so I end up calling my ISP for tech support anyway...only to find that the answer was in the book somewhere else, under some other heading. How about a glossary of terms? This book is written in a cutesy/hip/slacker style that detracts from the good information that is in there. I'm embarrassed to leave the book out where any guest may see it! BW."
5,Learning new things about Windows 7,So far I like what I've read. Has things to speed up my computer and many more things. Windows 7 for Dummies is very interesting.
1,This book stinks.,"I am sorry. I have just tried several tasks, none of which worked as explained in this book. The index is horrible -- virtually useless for finding anything on even the simplest topics. The illustrations are so small and blurry you can barely make them out.I don't know what else to recommend, but better to fiddle around yourself than trying to get anything done with this book -- which is what I have had to do. I would like to get my money back but I don't know if it is possible.Chris Brune"
3,Only dummies will buy this book.,"I must have been a dummy to buy this book. The only help it gave me was dealing with libraries, a new feature to Windows 7."
3,Dummies are for real dummies,"After years using Macs, I found this book was somewhat helpful, but probably not worth the price for me"
5,Duh...turns out I wasn't a big enough Dummy,"I know this book/DVD will come in handy at some point, but until then I haven't needed it. Good deal though."
5,Great informative book,I got this because my husband and I had both just got new computers with Windows7 preloaded. This set is fantastic. He took the disk with him for use with his laptop and I kept the book at home. I love that the 'Dummies' books are so clearly written. Learning our way around the new system was a breeze thanks to this book. I highly recommend it!
4,good usefull book,Very helpful in using this program. Disc really helps get going for an old guyjb you want too many words
5,A valuable reference and instruction.,"In upgrading from Windows XP to Windows 7, there were significant changes and upgrades. I was able to learn my way around quickly, and the DVD, which was included, was also very helpful."
1,Windows 7,This book did not have any information on windows remote assistanceit was of no use to me at all.sorry I would not recomend
3,It's okay.,"I guess I'm a bigger dummy than this was written for. I don't have the best luck finding answered, but there have been some things it is invaluable for."
3,Helpful,"It is ok but it is not what I expceted. I like more pictures and with black it is really harder to compare when you are on line. I knew when I ordered the book it was not in color, so just have me to blame. Still helpful."
2,Disappointed,"I guess I was really expecting much more from this book and then was let down. It really didn't add anything that I didn't already known by just turning on my machine. I went from Windows 2000Pro to Windows 7 and thought I needed the help this book would give me. I was wrong. Just by using my computer and hitting on the key points, I learned more than I got out of this book. It was a waste of my money."
2,The nightmare known as Windows 7,"I'm not really impressed with this publication. As for going through the motions of making an OS work, it's fine. I was hoping for a book/DVD that would help with problems/trouble shooting of the Winows7 OS. It failed miserably. And, believe me, this OS needs all the help it can get. It is very difficult for me to understand how MicroSoft found it in their hearts to release this version in it's present, no good, sorry, unusuable state (I guess money and greed still prevail in Redmond, WA). But, alas, I veer from the reason for this review...sorry 'bout that. As for the book/DVD bundle, it will not help you find and succsessly diagnose problem in Window7. It only tells you how to navigate through it. When you run into a problem, the book does not cover it. Don't waste your money on this one. If you need ""problem solving"" help, find something else."
1,Was sent the wrong book.,"Well, I ordered Windows 7 for Dummies but received Office 2010 for Dummies instead. When I called about it they said they would send me the correct book when I send them a copy of the invoice and mail the wrong book back to them. If this was my company, I would have immediately sent out the right book and sent a postage paid package to put the wrong book in so it wouldn't be so inconvienent for the customer. I order merchandise ""on-line"" because it comes right to my home. I have limited time to prepare and mail back the wrong book...that is why I use Amazon. This transaction was not convenient and I haven't had time to send the wrong book back yet. Linda Hotchkiss"
4,Helpful with basics,"This book is helpful with the basics. This version of Windows seems so very very different from other versions, it is not as intuitive to set up & maintain as previous versions, and this book is helpful in navigating your way thru. However, I have some very specific questions that the book either does not address at all, or gives only 1 or 2 sentances to and not enought detail.In short, if you are new to computers & windows, this book is a great starter. If you are advanced and need specific questions answered in greater detail, keep looking."
3,title something of a misnomer,"With a name like ""Raw Materials"", and an instrumentation of piano and alto sax, you might think the CD has the raw materials for songs, but it isn't formed into a whole. That's not the case. Vijay Ayer on piano has a full style - he plays a lot of notes, and Rudresh Manthappa is no minimalist either. Unfortunately, what it does miss is a certain amount of blues and swing. ""Fly Higher"" might have the most swing, many other songs have a lot of straight eighth notes. Although Vijay and Rudresh give the songs their all, after a while the technicality gets off-putting. In addition, there isn't enough variation from song to song. So, the CD can get a tiring. ""All The Names"" and ""Forgotten System"" are good songs, but their jarring, technical style starts to run together."
4,the bleeding edge...,"I'm just surprised not to see more superlatives thrown around in these reviews. Personal tastes vary widely, of course, and certainly most radio listeners would not even be so charitable as to label this as ""too wierd,"" but to my ears, this album is just amazing. The creativity in the relation between the evolving spoken word content and the shifting musical landscape is, well, extraterrestrial. I guess it's just a matter of how far out there you like it. But if you have experimental tastes and are interested in spoken word, this is a must."
3,Huh?. . .,"I have long been a fan of Saul Williams back since his slam days with Jessica Care Moore and his first book and everything, but I really don't like this record, I find it to be just very strange. And there's a difference between being a very deep and emotional, and brilliant artist, but this is downright weird, strange stuff starts to happen when you listen to this record. And don't get me wrong, I like the ""lyrics"" to all the ""songs"", he even took some stuff from his books and put it in, but to hear some of that set to music is almost wrong. Overall, there is a thin line between new, revolutionary and weird, Amethyst Rock Star just crossed that line and kept on going."
2,that one tune rocks,"That om nia american song - man, that slams, just blows a hole right thru your head. Worth buying the album if only to burn another genius tune to your one-hit wonders collection."
2,Dull,"Chantal somehow makes this batch of old standards sound, well,old. She sounds like she is going through the paces, with little new interpretation and even less inspiration. If you want a higher level of Canadian talent, consider Diana Krall."
2,Lathe Operation and Maintenance,"The book is fine for a true beginner, but hardly worth the money if you already have some lathe skills. I hoped the book would explain how to adjust bearings but any maintenance information was very basic and practically nonexistent."
4,Beautiful book,Very nicely done. This was a gift for a teenage girl who recently joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is the only one I found that could be adapted for teenagers.
2,Baptism memories: A Keepsake Journal and Scrapbook,"I was disappointed with this book. I expected a keepsake for an infant's baptism, but this book was more suitable for an eight year old who has taken classes and is just being baptised. There were few illustrations and bland coloring. There was also no special page to acknowledge Godparents. I returned it."
3,Spencer Jones is a Company man,"Go camera but, it is a toy and not for serious pictures. Kodak get real and add a flash, it wouldn't cost that much more. Mr. Jones's review is right out of the company handbook. Kodak's man comes on as a sales pitch, no one talks that way."
2,Mc3,"This is a so-so camera. evrything is great except for the fact that there is no flash, and the screen is not backlit"
1,The MC3 got bugs Don't buy it,"I bougth a MC3 on April, and discover that it got a 2-3mm black line on the LCD of the camera!!I ask the kodak why, but they said it's normal, there is a bug when they design but they think the mc3 can still function so they consider the black line as normal!!!I really very disappointed about the MC3!!Think before you buy!!!"
5,cool,this product is really awesome. the software is great. it makes it easy to mix videos and audio and it includes other great features.
2,one fatal flaw!!,"First of all, i love this device. Second, and most important, i agree totally with a previous reviewer: Ever since i installed the software, it has rendered my entire computer unstable and i get reset all the time. I can not even view the videos i recorded from this thing on my OWN COPUTER!! this is not good. The device is fun, but the software ruined my computer. i am not joking about this. Kodak needs to fix this serious quality control issue. mabye if i was a computer expert, i could repair the damage, but that should not be a prerequisite to buying a fun toy."
3,"Ok, But Not Great","OK, the Mc3 is a great toy for those of you that aren't serious photographers ok anything like that. It's MP3 playback is excellent on headphones, but the speaker doest't sound all that well. The picture quality is very good for this price range; I can blow the pictures up 8 or 9 times and it's quality would be clost to perfect. The drawbacke to it are that there is no flash, no backlight, and when you are taking videos, the microphone distorts the sound a bit. But, with best quality video, it's picture is great, and when transferring songs onto it, it is almost lightning speed if you use the cable that they give you. In all, I would recommend this product to anyone between the ages of 10-25."
3,Somewhat disappointing for Rhapsody.,"I would have given it 3.5/5 if I could.This seems to be the weakest album entry Rhapsody has had since Legendary Tales. While it does have some incredible songs on it (""Queen Of The Dark Horizons,"" comes to mind), it also has more than the usual number of tracks which feature ""the narrator"" prominantly. For those unfamiliar with Rhapsody, the narrator is a voice over of astoundingly-bad quality. I don't often use the phrase ""cheesy"" to describe things, but the narrator is extremely cheesy, enough to make you embarassed to listen to it. I've actually gotten into the habit of ripping the CD to wav format, editing out those parts, and reburning the CD. The lyrics may be cheesy too, but they seem to work better when sung than when read."
2,Cheeseball Metal at it's best (worst?),"I love the music but this is just too cheesy even for the me, & I enjoy the whole concept of fantasy metal (Blind Guardian's (""Nightfall in Middle Earth"" is one of my favorites). The band is obviously talented, but the only tolerable vocals were the ones in Italian. When they sang (or worse, spoke) in English I could understand how stupid the lyrics were. These guys should concentrate on instrumentals. They would be more enjoyable. Fantasy metal walks a fine line between the artfully fanciful & the absurd, & these guys pole-vaulted over it. I probably won't listen to this disc much, in spite of the great music. I certainly won't buy anything else by them."
4,Creepy and Funny at the Same Time,"Eddie, Winks, Cassie, and Scott were bored so they decided to go for a drive even though they don't have licences, just to make sure they would pass their drivers test. When Eddie was at the wheel he hit someone named Brandit Tinkers and killed him. Now they're getting messages and phone calls from him.Great book!! It's really scary and funny at the same time. You'll be really suprised at the end. It was the first R.L. Stine book i read that isn't GoosebumpsI rate this book 4 stars because it was a little draged on.-- Scottie S. age 10"
5,Hit and Run T.J.S,"This is a great book by RL Stine. It is about 4 friends named Eddi,Winks(which i short for his last name Winkelman),Cassie,and scott. One night they decided to take Scott's parents' car out driving and they hit a man. Neither one of them had their drivers licence so they just left. Couple of days later two of them had recieved letters from the dead courpse. Wasn't he?"
3,a very mediocre book,"It was really kind of stupid. It was very predictable. Just to make this review short, it wasn't his best."
1,The most predictable book I've ever read...,"I didn't even get past page 19...I KNEW what was going on, I even checked the ending just to make sure...Wow, maybe I read too much...R.L. Stine is good for a quick read and I do think younger kids would get scared...so his books are excellent for them...just don't try to pick one up if you're over 15. He is talented, though...:)"
3,Four friends make a mistake and are involved in a accident.,"This book was not nearly as good as I thought it would be. True, it did have a couple of points that made you want to turn on all the lights and lock all the doors, but, it was not all that creepy. For those of you that like this book, I recommend reading ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". It is basically the same idea, but there are major differences. Wanna know waht they are? Read the book. Anyway, back on topic, this is an okay book, but pretty much a quick read."
3,Just a Joke!,"It was okay, but not very scary.If you like mystery, you might like this.It's supposed to be scary, but it's not.It's basicly about fore friends that make a mistake and kill somone in an accident."
5,Book Review,Hi i'm writing about the book Hit and Run. This book is really good because it always leave you on the edge of your seat. I thought it was so good I could't put it down Ifinally did put it down I couldn't wait to pick it back up.
5,ONE OF THE BEST!,"Unbelievable show! I am still blown away by the magic and the vibrant world that has been created for our two main characters. This story will make you think twice about the world we live in; who is real, who is not, and how many people we have lost. If this wasn't enough a love triangle is thrown into the mix, just to shake things up. Who will our man choose will it be the girl next door or the girl that came out of nowhere? You will have to find the answer to this question by watching, sorry. Time and again you will be taken be surprise by what small sayings truly connect us to one another and how our actions affect each other. These are the most important of everything since most of us have been in these types of situations. The creators did a spectacular job in finding ways to make us care for these characters. Please pick this up if you enjoyed Fullmetal Alchemist you will enjoy this!"
3,Mediocre anime at its finest,"There is nothing in this series that is particularly memorable other than the main character herself, Shana, who is popular for not much else other than being adorable. The story line is pretty standard for anime; mysterious magic girl, meets mysterious magic guy, love triangle ensues, save the world, series end. Other than the main character the rest are pretty boring and not that well developed save a couple, one of whom is only developed directly in her relation to Shana. It's not executed particularly well but it's enough to keep anime fans entertained enough to sit through the series at least.Once again, it's not a bad series, just average."
5,"Shakugan No Shana, Best Anime Ever","I have seen at least 52 different kinds of anime, but nothing is compared to Shakugan No Shana. I love this anime and how Japanese voice actors played their roles were simply amazing. Shana is a cute and unbelievably strong. There is no other anime show like this. This anime show is by the same creators of Aria the Scarlet Ammo, and Hayate No Gotoku. If your a fan of those shows or even if your not this is the ultimate anime show above any anime shows. I love Shakaugan No Shana. :)"
4,"Great for the Price, and Kid Proof!!","If you don't mind putting it together yourself. I did it by myself in under an hour, and I am no Bob Villa. So, it was pretty simple. I do remember it being extremely heavy though, so watch your back.I love the fact that you can flip the seat and turn it into a coffee table when needed. I have an oddly shaped living room, so a coffee table would just be in the way. I Keep this up against the wall next to my couch for guests to sit on. When I am entertaining I pull it out into the center of the room to put my chips/Salsa & Margaritas on!!!I have had it for a couple of years now, and other than having to tighten the legs with the L wrench it came with a few times (it gets a little wobbly) it is very low maintenance. I have two rough & tumble boys and it is still going strong!! I love Multi-Purpose items!! All in all I give it 9 out of 10 only because I thought it was all black when I ordered it, but I still love it..."
1,Infrared Ice Cream,"This is wanna-be heavy poser metal. I once read a fantastic interview in THE GRIMOIRE was awesome! However, the music is simply WEAK! 1 star is to high in my book!"
5,"Fantastic eye product, wouldn't trade it for the world!!!","I recently found Glicare's Eye Gel on Amazon after a year of not using the product. I have been trying other skincare lines, and although they are great, the eye creams do not compare. I would find my eyes a little puffy in the morning, no matter how much sleep I got! And after turning 32, I am beginning to see what will turn into crow's feet, I immediately did a web search for it and found it again!!! It is an amazing eye gel which offers instant results (at least for me). I hope the company never discontinues it!!! I highly recommend it..."
1,Worst Tribute,"I bought this CD at a local book store just about an hour ago. I wasn't going to and wish I would have seen the reviews on here before buying it. I saw bands like VooDoo Glow Skulls and Guttermouth, so I figured it would have some sort of ska/punk sound too it. I didn't realize that the quality of it would sound so awful, not only did it sound like this CD was put together in 2 hours, it is a disgrace to the memebers of Sublime and Brad. I am a huge fan and would buy just about anything Sublime, so I was real disappointed in this CD. This is going straight in the trash, don't waste your 14 bucks on it, go down to the gas station and pick up a 12 pack."
1,Garbage,"If you don't like these bands you'll hate this album, even if you love sublime. Get LOOK AT ALL THE LOVE WE FOUND - A SUBLIME TRIBUTE. forever free is a joke. i can't believe these bands are using sublime to sell albums...its especially irritating when there is so much live and unreleased studio Sumblime out there that Universal owns the rights to and refuses to sell. We could have twenty new Sublime albums but instead we get one crappy cover album and one that's mediocre at best. In other words...if you buy this you WILL regret it. 'Nough said."
1,a joke.....i think,"This is an insult to bradley. The last tribute was descent, but this is a step to far."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I am a Sublime nut so I picked this CD up. I was so dissapointed I almost threw it in the trash. (and should have) This is a miserable attempt at gaining attention to a new music label by doing a tribute record of a band that they didn't even know that well. If you look at the tracklist you will realize that some of the songs are in fact covers of other artists as well, so these jerks aren't even covering authentic Brad Nowell written music.If you want to buy a sublime tribute CD,DON'T BUY THIS ONE.I recommend Look at all the Love we Found.Better artists covering real sublime songs."
2,Disappointed in the West,"I was excited to get this CD in the mail; however I was quite disappointed when I played it. It is CD+G so the lyrics show up on the TV screen but if you do not know the melody of the song, you will not be able to sing along. This CD plays a lot of the bass part of song and you have to know and create the melody to harmonize along to the music. I knew some of the chorus melodies but not all of the verses to the song---therefore, I was quite disappointed, especially since there is not a vocal strain of the songs to LEARN the melody to the song verses. Make sure you know all of the melodies to the songs if you plan to purchase this CD because you will have to harmonize to the recorded bass portion of the song. You've been warned!"
5,EXCELLENT,"The other review details the content of the book very well - the service performed by a decent young American for his country. The VENONA transcripts have shown thatSoviet penetration of government and media in the United States was, in that era, a real danger (at least 300 agents in the Federal government - including a Congressman and later justice of the New York state supreme court - and this known to be just a fraction of the full number).Don't buy the 1972 revision. It omits, unfortunately, the role played by Mrs. Philbrick, whom her husband describes as a most reluctant Communist!"
2,Bought it last year and it barely made it through the winter,"It was cheap - hence I bought it. But, I will have to buy a new one this winter I think as it ripped already. Not good quality, also didn't really fit my patio set either. But, I got what I paid for, I guess."
2,Came broken,I bought this for my husband for fathers day and when we opened the box it was broken. I went to a local store and bought one and I love it. Just dont order it online!
1,Size and Product Picture miss match,"I had a Romco oven that wore out. I went online and purchased a new one. I would have thought that the one I was buying was the same size as my old one because it showed a picture of the oven cooking 2 chickens. When I recieved the oven it is much smaller than the one pictured. It will hardly hold one small chicken, let alone two. I would not advise anyone to purchase this product."
5,Ronco Rotesserie,I received my Ronco in 5 days time that was promised. Am completely satisfied with it. Thank you.
1,not big enough,"online it looked like a much bigger roaster. but i dont see how u could get 2 chickens in the thing, unless they were very small birds."
1,"Garbage, Garbage, Garbage!",Ronco should be put out of business!!!! They should be a shamed of the Garbage and service that they sell!!!!
5,Showtime Compact Rotisserie,"I heard two girls at work discussing this rotisserie so I ordered it, and am so glad I did. I have cooked a whole chicken, pork chops, kabobs, hamburgers, pork roast and beef roast so far and have loved every one of them! The biggest shock was the beef round roast because they are lean and tend to be tough and I did not have high expectations of the outcome. I was wrong! It was the best round roast I have ever had in my life. Clean up is also a breeze. I highly recommend this product."
3,easy bake oven for adults,"Yes, the quality of this product did not live up to my expectations. However, I will admit that it does the job. I have cooked a whole chicken, cornish hens, and chicken wings in this machine. All have come out wonderful, in particular the chicken wings. In fact, I would say that I created the best tasting wings ever using this machine.Clean up was relatively easy when cooking cornish hens and a whole chicken, but more difficult with wings (because they are the fattiest part of the chicken, they tend to splatter). Another drawback would be the elastic food ties, which effect the taste of the chicken. Washing the ties with cold water seems to help a bit. My last disappointment with this machine is that no flavor injector was included. This is a pretty bare bones model, but thankfully I got it at a low price.It's worth paying a little more for a higher quality machine."
1,Non-stick Paint comes off the loading rods - Unhealthy & dangerous,"I bought the oven because it claims to provide a healthy alternative. But the reality is that nonstick material / black paint on the ""spit rods"" (gear wheels) comes off with time -- while sticking to the cooked food; This not only makes the food unhealthy but creates health risks. The nonstick coating has shown to be carcinogenic.The spit rods/ gear wheels should have been stainless steel."
3,Hard work after.,I cooked a pork roast. It's not too bad putting meat on prongs and into oven. The hardest is removing hot tender meat from the oven the trying to remove the meat off the prongs without squishing it to pieces. Meat comes out very tender and full of taste. Clean up is a snap..toss in dishwasher.
2,"Badly constructed spit rod assembly, breaks easily","The grill itself is pretty good, though I had only used it once, before the spit rod, which was very thinly welded on the gear wheel, broke, when slight pressure was applied. The construction of the spit rod assembly is very poor. The manual stated that the spit rods were attached to the wheel with screws but that was not true. Customer service is giving me a hard time to replace the part which I am sure they know is defective and as I clearly explained to them. They are trying to help in a half hearted way and I have to email or fax an invoice as well as pay a shipping fee for the broken part, hate it. Why would a company sell a defective product and then not promptly correct it, is beyond my understanding."
5,still learning,it does a magnificant job. i am still in the learning process regarding this item. i have no serious problems with the oven.
5,Sooo good!,"My father gave this product to my husband. Not because he didn't like, but because he likes sharing. I thought, wow, something else to clutter our kitchen. It can clutter all it wants! I have never eaten a roasted chicken that tastes so good! I love watching it cook. The smell is outstanding! I can stop it and let it brown in one spot. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The cleanup is nothing. No splattering. It's worth buying! Can't wait to try it on chicken wings."
5,Should have bought the bigger one,"Great product,works really well. My only problem is that I used the regular sized one for 15 years,and I'm more used to the larger one.As long as you don't want to cook over a 12 pound turkey,this one is great."
4,Love it!,"I love it and use it all the time. I use the basket for chicken pieces and skewers. The veggie steamer/roaster tray that sits on top makes perfect roasted potatoes and veggies. I have rotisseried chicken, turkey, even elk roasts. My only complaint (the reason I didn't give it 5 stars) is that I can't set it to come on before I get home. You can't plug it into a timer switch, because the dial timer ticks away without electricity. Also, the dial timer is not as accurate as a digital would be. But that doesn't stop me from using it often. I will have to use it out on the patio in the summer, because it heats up the kitchen, which I love on cold, cloudy winter days! All in all, it is worth every penny!"
1,customer service a joke,I purchased one of the pro rotisseries and paid over 200 for it and when I ordered a replacement part was lied to for 3 months before giving up not worth having if you cannot use it. Ron had a great idea but in the end he is just another pitch man. too bad.
1,Great -- piece of junk!,"Was fabulous for 1 chicken (best I ever had) and 3 small legs of lamb. Quit cold on the next use, in the middle of cooking a chicken. Adding at least $25 to the cost of cooking a chicken is a highly questionable value for money."
2,failed after 4 years use,stop playing CD. radio and cassette works though. Forget if they have warranty. Should have kept the receipt carefully.
3,sun necklace,pendant is good weight and thickness with sun design on both sides however one side the design is noticeable off center and slightly off on the other. also the design could be deeper in the pewter for better clarity
3,frays easily,"It's a super cute collar. But kitties scratch, and thus this collar frays like crazy. Bummer, because it looks so good on the old man. See my photo..."
2,Short lived,My daughter's cat tore this collar up in no time. Would not buy this again. Seems to me any pet collar would be made to last longer than a week or two.
2,Break-away gone,"I put this on my cat and it was gone in a day. I know it's a break away safety collar, but it would have been nice if it had hung in a little bit. My cats not much of a tree climber, but he is a fence scooter under and I think that's where he managed to break out of it."
2,Comes off easily,"I ordered two of these in different patterns and while the patterns were really cute, my cats had them off within minutes. They didn't slip them off, they were not staying clipped together. I put them back on multiple times but they kept getting them off so I eventually gave up. Although the breakaway collar is a great feature for safety, it breaks away far too easily on these collars. I ended up just chucking them and ordered different collars for my cats."
3,very pretty,"I love the color of this collar and the fish are very pretty. My cat has had this on for about three weeks and it is beginning to fray a bit. This is probably true of any collar that is made of fabric rather than leather so if you purchase, just be aware that it won't hold up as well as leather. I'd still buy it again because the clasp is great and easy to get on and off and the quality is good."
2,No sturdier than your average break-away cat collar,"I bought this for my cat who needs to wear a tag to activate our cat door. We had already lost 2 collars that I bought at PetCo and I had hoped that these would be better- still ""break-away"" but maybe not as easily? Not the case, it's 2 months later and my cat has lost both of these collars as well. They are cute, but expensive and no more durable than the $2 version at your local pet store."
5,Great collar,"Bought this for my Siamese, and boy does he look good !. Good collar fits great, and more important stays on when he is wrestling with his siblings."
3,Disappointed,"I bought two of these cat collars (one pirate, one goldfish) and was so pleased when they arrived--they were so cute! I put them on my two cats and they both looked very handsome. However, within only a week or two both collars were completely shredded, the cute designs obliterated with only a whole lot of long loose threads remaining, which I had to trim off to keep the cats from swallowing them. Yes, the cats scratched at the collars, but only sporadically--once or twice a day--which I think is well within the bounds of normal cat behavior. The product just did not hold up the way I think it should."
3,ok,"the clasp lets go a little too easy, better than most clasp ones though,, if your cat isnt activly trying to remove it it may work for ya,,, very cute"
5,awesome!,"I love this collor fits very well and adjustablecomfotable for the cat. this has a push in snap closure made of plastic holds well but will break awayif kitty gets into a situation, love the different styles they offer, many, would not hesitate to order again from this seller."
4,music history,The information was very helpful. We enjoyed reading the book and learned some good stuff about Handel. It was a good size and not too wordy.
3,Worth the wait!?,"...OK, about the album...This is definitly the 80's!If you're a BOA firsts albums lover, this one might not be the right one for you.It is much more heavy metal(ish), lots of synths-although some productions from the 80's contain a lot more.Thank God, no synth drums or guitars are used here.The songs are good, no awful ballads, the guitars really have that 80's heavy sound but on the whole some of the BOA spirit is kept alive.So, this might not be the first BOA's album you wanna buy-get yourself the first one, HIGH ON THE HOG or RAUNCH AND ROLL if you're not familiar with BOA; but it sure sounds better than Black Oak's RACE WITH THE DEVIL or I'D RATHER BE SAILING and without a doubt A MILLION TIMES BETTER than the horrible WILD BUNCH(what a disgrace to BOA and TOMMY BOLIN!!!!!!!).So yes, finally I'm glad I waited and didn't cancel my order..."
3,"Ingeniously crafty plot,with an predictable ending.","Bradley ingeniously sets up this plot. Managed to capture me in his web. Not using quotations to indicate when a character is talking, makes it a bit confusing. Tending to drag towards the end causes the ending to be predictable."
2,Beach Chair Read,"This may not be a literary masterpiece but as first effort one must recognize its relative strengths. I believe this is a perfect read for a lazy summer afternoon when you do not have to be attentive to every word and are relaxed and forgiving in criticism. Having your own toes in the sand may bring you deeper into the story.Because a potential shipwreck in a shifting sand dune (all clumsy metaphors aside) along with a mid 20th-century murder mystery makes for a great escape. Especially when that shipwreck may rewrite history. The tangle of unrequited love is just that and it does strain the reader to care. However, I enjoyed the overall plot and benefited from parts of the history - both Portuguese exploration and Australian commitments in WW2. And like I say, a solid beach read made even better if you sip a couple of gin and tonics along with it."
1,The worst book I have ever read.,"I read the reviews on the book's back cover and expected greatness. As the first review stated I indeed kept turning the pages -- but only to skip over the chapters that had little or no bearing on what the book was about. It was truly disppointing.The plot is predictable, and the lack of proper quotation punctuation makes it difficult to follow."
2,A disappointment.,"The characters seemed shallow, without depth given to some of their pasts. The plot droned on and on...with me pursuing only to find the ending, which was disappointing. The lack of quotation punctuation was annoying. It felt like a cheap show with gratuitous sex thrown in for appeal. If you like historic mystery try: City of Light instead."
2,Less a mystery than a soap opera,"Billed as a mystery-within-a-mystery, this book has a moderately interesting historical premise with some tantalizing bits from relatively ancient sources. The angst of academics pursuing a probably hopeless cause is overdone, I think. The unraveling of that tale is way too slow, little suspense actually builds, and the ending is a disappointment. The soap opera within a soap opera love story(-ies) just seemed pointless, a lame attempt at titillation, with an ambigous resolution. The gratuitous four-letter words were an annoyance."
5,Awesome Wookbook,This is a great workbook! It will help you discipline yourself to study a little everyday. The content is wonderful!
3,"Good, not great","I found this workbook to be incredibly eye-opening and applicable in some areas, and dull in others. Overall, it is a good book but I'm sure there are better ones out there!"
1,POOR,"I'm very dissapointed in what I recieved in the mail. Almost every page in the book was written in. On top of that, instead of sending me the book itself that I requested, they sent me the study guide to the book I wanted."
5,Ordering more for my dear ones.,"New insights to passages I've read and re-read, but not thought of in this light. I am truly enjoying, and am ordering for my dear daughters-in-law."
5,Max Lucado Experiencing the Heart of Jesus,"This is a beautiful book, a bit larger than I had anticipated. I feel I gota great deal on the book. It arrived quickly in good condition. The packingwas great and I am thrilled to have it in my library."
5,Immerses you in the word!,"This book is fabulous. I so appreciate it's ""workbook"" type style to get me reading the bible and seeing the reality and references to Jesus' love for us. Being able to take pencil to paper to not just read the bible, but process what is being said is so helpful for me. Max Lucados conversational style is thoughout the book as well giving perspective and wisdom in his very relateable fashion. I strongly recommend this book, for baby Christians on up to the very well versed. Thanks Max!"
4,Blessed,"This book brought me thru a really rough time. Getting to know & experience Jesus took me to a new level of Christianity that I needed. I have further yet to go. It helped me think, ponder & relook at what I thought I knew in another light. To believe & understand how much God really loved me would bring tears to my eyes. I really don't want this book to end!"
3,An unbiased historical review of Christianity,"Historically revealing and presented in an unbiased, non-confrontational style, this book takes a look at Christianity from a historical perspective. This book covers Christianity from its beginnings to the current age of Internet surfing. The author disects Christianity by focusing on geographical regions to start with and then chronologically within those regions. Although it covers the entire span of Christian history, I thought the author should have given the origins of Christianity much more attention. The other portion that I found somewhat lacking was the development of the various Protestant denominations. However, this book was well rounded in its approach overall and worth the time and effort to read. If you're looking for a book to discuss the general development of Christianity, this book will do nicely. If you are looking for a book to describe the differences between denominations and their roots, I suggest looking elsewhere."
3,textbook for a religion intro class,"had this textbook for a religion intro class, good book, very informative and enjoyable read"
5,"Christianity, A Global History",I bought a copy for a friend. It is a great book. The service from Amazon was excellent.
1,Strange sense of 'global',"Apparently, the 'global' aspect of this book means the spread of Western Christianity to Africa and Asia in the modern era. It almost completely overlooks Eastern Christianity and when it does refer to it, there are serious factual errors. One star is generous.I still have not found a good one-volume (or even two-volume) history of Christianity which is truly global. I continue to look. The best I've found thus far isA World History of Christianity(Adrian Hastings, ed.) -- definitely a much better choice than this book."
3,Really 3.5 stars,"3 stars to me means ""If you like this sort of thing, you'll like this one"".It fails to get 5 stars for the following reasons:- As Patrick Mower (Edmund) notes in the included interview, Patrick Magee's (Lear) performance is ""strange"" (but not really bad)- No subtitles (These help me to follow Shakespearian language)- The important and interesting role of Fool is underrepresented and not played wellThe positives:- Mower is pretty good as Edmund- Ronald Radd is really good as Gloucester- The interview with Mower is interesting for insights into the process of creating this production and the actors involved- As Mower notes in that interview, this is a ""clear reading""; It is pretty easy to understand what the characters are saying even if you don't speak Shakespearian English every day- I was truly moved by Lear, Gloucester, and Edmund at some points"
3,More Fun to Read It,"The only first rate thing about this production is the diction. It's really possible to understand most of the words most of the time. That is achieved, unfortunately, by fairly deep cuts in the text which needs to be spoken.The worst thing about it is the wretched portrayal of the Fool, whose lines are the most severely cut. Without his empathy for the Fool, the King seems merely a pathetic, vainglorious old fool himself.I have loved this play ever since I read it in junior high school, and I've never seen a production that satisfied me. I suppose I'm a tough audience. This film had one good result; it sent me back to the text to see what the director and actors had missed."
2,Terrible version,"The production of the play was terrible. The acting was even worse. I was going to show it to my students, but I can't show them that performance. It was pathetic. Also, there is no closed captioning. If you were thinking about getting this version, I highly recommend that you think again."
1,amazing and unbelievable,This production is so bad that no words could do justice in describing it. You would have to be godlike and have a masochistic streak a mile long to get through the entire production.
4,great replacement battery,"for my nikko drift car, it came with charge i was able to use it out of package. It works just as the original did. its a great replacement for the original nikko"
5,What It Feels Like To Get Punched In The Nose!,"Until I read this book, I hadn't realized I knew very little about boxing even though I had seen many fights and read bios of famous boxers. This was entirely different.Not only will you learn some basics about the sport, but the author is excellent at describing what it's like to spend torturous minutes in the ring. Whew, I used to think I'd like to give it a go. After reading this - no thanks!I appreciated the author's total honesty in here, which includes admitting her character flaws. Best of all, this a ""fast read,"" which means Lynn Snowden Picket wrote it well. Good stuff!"
5,They Even Rock Live!,"I couldn't be more impressed with Sixx:A.M.'s live performance, since that is often the proving ground of many bands. I have seen 4 other Motley concerts, so I should know that these guys aren't just a spin-off or some disgruntled band member trying to ""stick it"" to the rest of the band. The sound was great, and I am happy to say Thanks James, and all the band, for making my son's first concert a wonderful experience. Good luck on the rest of your tour, can't wait to hear more from you!"
4,Unexpected...,Good music...it's kind of like a diary on it's own. LOVE Life is Beautiful! Can't wait to read the book.
3,hmmmm,the cd is 'ok'... the songs sound all the same with differing lirics.if you find it used at a price that suits you...buy it.
2,"Has musical potential, but is lyrically cheesy","The album has potential musically, but man, the lyrics awful and I can't get past them. It's fine when music has an explicit story and message, but it could be conveyed in a much more interesting way. The lyrics here are like the daily news, but good music is more poetic. The Amazon review seems harsh, but dead-on."
3,Soundtrack to a book,"I really thought this CD would have been way different. I was expecting more rock but it seems like a lot of parts have someone talking in them. I understand this CD was a soundtrack to a book but who really does that nowadays? I mean, people do soundtracks to movies of course, but a book? It just seems really awkward to me and even though I really like the song Life Is Beautiful, the rest of the CD is just okay. In fact, the only reason I bought the CD was for that song but instead I just bought into a bunch of talking and a way for the person to make more bucks by advertising his book through a CD."
1,i cant believe people like this cd! about 3 tracks are good,"3 maybe 4 tracks are good, if you liked life is beatiful thats about the only song that sounds like that, most of the songs are slow and whining. dont buy!"
5,"Everybody Gets High, Everybody Gets Low",3 Cheers to Nikki Sixx for doing something outside of the box again! Nikki comes out of his closet with his skeletons and demons and shares an obviously devasting time in his life. Heroin Diaries Soundtrack is an inspirational and very gutsy work of art. It was written from the heart with no stereotypes or intentions of airplay. Kudos to Sixx for 1) Just sharing his life with his fans -- even the dark corners of it. 2) For his work with Running Wild in the Night giving hope to homeless kids. 3) For doing things that other rockstars don't -- Get Real & Be Honest!
5,Awesome,I saw Sixx AM at CrueFest and they were great. I immediately bought both the soundtrack and book by Nikki Sixx. Both are awesome! Their songs have so much meaning to them!
4,Welcome back Sixx!,"If your a Nikki Sixx fan then just get this already. Always takes too long to hear something new from someone in the band and this is worth the wait. I'll always prefer the Crue, but it's always good to hear new stuff from anyone in the band. Great album!"
3,it's alright,"It's alright, it nothing that hasn't been done before, except the wierd Sixx voice overs, it has a Tool New Radicals feel to it. has a sort of Nu Metal AFI feel also."
3,Bound for Broadway,"I'm a little disturbed. I think I want my Mommy?!The maddness of addiction and recovery in a song? As an entire album? You must be crazy?! Seriously, it allowed me to know a little bit more than I really wanted to know. It's Brilliantly painful to listen too because you know it's real. The listener is taken all the way through the Prelude, the Life Story, and the Epilogue of a life lived in chemical insanity. Musically, it's a little like the Trans-Siberian Orchestra on Super Dope meets ""Stand By Me"" on Street Junk in a cold dark alley and together they decided an album was necessary. It's nothing I've heard before, and that's a good thing! Musical Nightmares have a greater impact when they are original. The composing Musicians on this album have survived Sixx:A.M., let's pray they're alive for Sixx:30! Rock On and On!!!!!!!"
5,Along with the Book a story everyone should hear and read,"This cd along with the book Heroin Diaries tell an amazing tale of the rock star life style. A must have set for fans of Rock, sometimes a disturbing tale with a light at the end of the tunnel.. What a talented group of artist."
5,Much Better than Expceted,I had heard the single on Fuse and wanted to give it a try. This was way better than I ever expected. Nearly as good as Brides of Destruction but with more harmony. Definitely a buy.
4,Truth is stranger than fiction,"A period of WWII history we don't pay much attention to, the immediate aftermath of the fall of France in 1940 left the powerful French naval fleet at grave risk of falling under Nazi control. This book details what happened in what may well have been one of the decisive actions of WWII.The battle was fought between British and French naval units who only days before had fought side by side, and had a far reaching impact on the course of WWII.I only gave the book four stars because i was left feeling disappointed that the focus was too narrow. There is much more to the story than simply the naval battle at Mers el Kabir which i wish the author had gone into in more detail."
5,Works Great,Extremely effective in controlling dust. Easy to install. The environment in my shop is much cleaner and virtually dust free.
2,Disappointing for the Expense,"This attractively packaged and extremely expensive set contains the six previously released ""Inspector Morse"" collections plus a book full of episode-by-episode details. It should be a pleasure to own, watch, and read. However, the book is rife with egregious typographical errors and mistakes of fact (wrong air dates, for example) and contains almost no episode cast or other production information. It's full of detail on the show's Oxford locations, and if that's all you're interested in then you'll probably be satisfied. As for the DVDs themselves, on my 46"" 1080p tv most episodes look like they were shot off a bedsheet in someone's basement direct to a home DVD burner. Definitely NOT a bargain at $430. (Additionally, my set contained two badly mastered/damaged discs, causing me to return it for a refund.) Given this show's enduring popularity, I presume that eventually they'll remaster the original films for a new, improved DVD release. I'll wait."
1,"Avoid sharp practices (Morse is great, pricing is obscene)","I recently purchased a region free DVD player online for about $80 and purchased the Morse series at Amazon.uk for $93 incl. shipping (arrived in 5 days). The Brit version contains 33 fully remastered episodes. The multi region DVD player was a great investment, since I have enjoyed other great Brit programming Lewis, Sherlock Holmes, Poldark, Sharpe, Jewel in the Crown at bargain prices. Often the Brit versions are remastered and of much better quality than the third rate American licensed versions. Also, it's been alleged that PBS video chopped up the Lewis series, leaving 10 minutes off each episode. I refuse to purchase excellent British programming that is the victim of sharp practices on this side of the pond."
3,Morse needs close caption,"When I ordered "" Inspector Morse / Complete Collection )"" I knew that was a Zone 1 Edition, but I assumed it included subtitles in the principal languages spoken in Europe, but ... nothing. My first intention was to return the product, but I tried to see the first and I was ... ¡ delighted ! : the put on scene of "" Jericho's Death "" by Anthony Minghella was superb. So I decided to keep the collection and I' ve been enjoying it and improving my comprehension of spoken English. But I think that the minimum that one edition of this prize must include is close caption for ear- handicapped people."
1,Does not play on US equipment,These DVDs would not play on either my BlueRay DVR or my older DVD player. I believe that is because they have too much material on each disk. They did seem to play on my computer.
3,What Did He Say?,"Morse and Lewis are great and it is a genuine joy to have the complete Morse set and to be able to view the episodes in sequence. We have some difficulty understanding all of the dialog, however, and looked in vain for capioning, which does not exist. I got on-line and found that we are not alone in our frustration. We expected the capioning because our complete Lewis set has it, and I would not have spent as much as I did for the Morse had I known we would have to ask each other, ""What did he say?"" several times in each story."
1,Rip Off,"It's frankly insulting that the Region 2 complete series is widely available for about $100, while the Region 1 version is priced at $350. The production costs are surely virtually identical."
2,Drop Dead - Liar's Club,If you are looking for a Jordis Unga (of Rockstar fame)CD this is not the band that she belonged to.
2,doesn't stand up,"This product is cute as can be but the poles provided have no place to be put, meaning we can not get it to prop open. The directions tell you to put the poles in from the top but there is no opening to do this. Obviously defective."
1,Disapointing,"The director relies too much on shock, gore and camera tricks to create a sense of tension. However these effects as used in this move act as a distraction. The movies that are successful in creating a tension leave a lot to the imagination which is far scarier than fake blood poured all over the place. If this movie is in fact made by teen agers, koodos to them a very good effort. If however it is a professional production... yikes... not so good."
2,"Did not develop feeling like ""I Want to know what will happen next""","Did not develop feeling like ""I Want to know what will happen next""I just watched until the end just becauses I paid for $9.99.I do like Christian slater and he played good as ""collapsed cup""."
2,Only watched part of it,"Just watched maybe 1/2 of it and thought it waskind of a ""dud"". Some reviews were good though???Just didn't get into it at all."
4,playback,Good movie! Liked it alot! The story line was very good. Christian Slater played a creepy cop alittle to well. The ending was good. Definately a good buy!
4,a fresh new idea...really liked it !!!,i really enjoyed this movie...i watch a lot of horror movies & i thought this had a nice fresh appeal........a little slow in the beggining but it does pick up & it made for a solid good horror movie.....worth checking out !!!
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"Playback is a B-Horror film that in a sense is nothing more than a new take on the Amityville Horror. Instead of a demon possessing a house, the demon in this film, keeps his spirit alive on videotape, and when someone sees the tape, they become the next possessed killer. The story was entertaining but wasn't really anything new or extraordinary and the same can be said about the cast. The cast, led by The Covenant's Toby Hemingway, wasn't one of the most talented casts I've ever seen, but they may have been the best looking. There are some really good looking people in this film, and believe it or not, it helps to keep your attention. The film is a little dull and predictable at times, but there is always something nice to look at. This movie isn't original and won't shock or surprise you, but it may just entertain you for a couple hours and it will most certainly have your eyes glued to the screen."
4,playback,"Even though it was somewhat predictable, I still enjoyed the concept of the movie... geez, just imagine finding out you are the son of a crazy dude who turns out to be your father!! ICK!!! There was that suspense factor that kept me interested throughout the movie."
2,Terrible!,"This was the worst movie I've seen in a while... I only watched it because Christian Slater usually plays in good movies.Independent movie, a feel of low budget, poltergeist-like, but way worse. I wouldn't have wasted my money on it..."
3,Mehhh...,"Although a great story concept, unfortunately 'Playback' has all the predictable parts of a standard horror movie. (1) Open door to abandoned house and say ""hello, anyone here?"" (2) Fall down repeatedly while running from bad guy (3) Knowledgable guy who works at a video store and can add creepy details about a supposed legend... You get the point.There were no surprises and although the plot attempted to add a twist, it really wasn't that surprising. We did watch the whole thing, so apparently it wasn't completely horrible. It was worth the price we paid (free with our Prime membership). If you have nothing else to do, go ahead and watch it, but if you have better movies to watch, let this one be."
3,"Interesting Ideas, but not very scary","Playback is not a scary movie. It didn't build any tension and the jump-out scares didn't work. The acting was about average, and so was the music. The story is what stood out to me and basically saved this movie. It's not really like The Ring, although it does have some elements from it. The story is actually creative and has some decent twists at the end. The tape in Playback basically possess those who watch it and the tape goes back for generations in the family. The film is based around teenagers, but isn't like your average teenage slasher. The intro was violent and probably the best part of the film, by the way.If you have time to kill or are slightly interested in this movie, check it out on Amazon Prime or Netflix streaming (available on both as of 6/15/12). Don't expect anything too scary cause you may come out disappointed.The movie has gore, sexual references, nudity and some frightening scenes."
4,Gripping,"A gripping story. The narrative is so powerful, I could not sleep for two days after reading the book. The book is cruel without being macabre"
3,the Roman,I recieved the book in the time limit as advertised the book was and old library book with stamps form that libraryit was permanently bent but the contents are just fine it is used but worn
5,THE FANTASTIC ANCIENT ROME,"MIKA TAKES US TO A JOURNEY THROUGHT THE ANCIENT ROME IN THE FANTASTIC ADVENTURES OF MINUTO LAUSO MANILIANO A GREAT ANTI-HERO: GREEDY, STUPI AND LOVELY."
1,Unusable,"This is a collection of very rough outlines from Youth Specialties celebrities. However, it seems like it means to give them one more book with their names on it rather than to produce worthwhile curriculum for youth. I didn't find this helpful at all."
4,Good for practicing kata but not for cutting practice,"The sword is good and pretty well finished, the scabbard was not as I expected for its laquered finish was not as fine compared to the sword.The blade is ok for practicing kata but you shouldn't try to cut anything with it because the blade risks bending."
2,holy crap!,I have payed less for better. I mean look at the Hamon its wire brushed on. It seems Like your just paying more for the extras rather than quality.
5,Robinair vacuum pump,"The product is great and well built. I was a bit disappointed it was manufactured in China as Robinair products used to be made in the USA, but this is a sign of the times. The product was well packed and the delivery was quick. I appreciate the service I get from Amazon.com, not only from the quality of merchandise, but also the information on shipping & delivery.Thank you,Guy W. Archerd"
5,Moravec recordings of these works are still available.,"Sadly, this fabulous recording became unavailable when Dorian went out of business. The good news is that Ivan Moravec recorded both of these concertos for Supraphon, thanks to whom both recordings are still available (cat. nos. SU 3508 and SU 3865). And they include additional Schumann and Brahms: the Kinderszenen and the Second Concerto."
5,Hot Band,"New Millenium is the best Pierrot + percussion group on the planet. (A Pierrot Ensemble consists of clarinet, flute, violin, cello, piano.) On this disc their playing soars and much of the music on this disc is excellent, all of it eminently worthwhile. The piece by Festinger is a wonderful as is the Robert Morris work. While I'm not a fan of Feldman, I understand where he's coming from and this performance has to be the best performance of this work. Wuorinen's piece is, as I've come to expect, mind-blowing in the very best sense of that expression.When's the next New Millenium disc coming out?!!"
4,total body conditioning,"This guy really does bring alot of equipment to the video except the kitchen sink, however he's got some great moves, and variety. It's nice to work using all that equipment that fitness people collect and put together in one workout."
2,More sensationalism than science,"While the science in this review is mostly accurate, it has a silly focus. It tries to grab the audience with scary speculations about cosmic disasters. Stephen Hawking hits the nail on the head. When the reviewer asks him to speculate about how gamma ray bursts could destroy Earth, he sensibly responds that this has not been a problem in Earth's 4.5 billion year history. Earth is in far greater danger from human actions, he says. Indeed.Unfortunately, Neil deGrasse Tyson continues the alarmist drumbeat uninterrupted, ignoring Hawking's wise words. Tyson plunges on to the next scary speculation - ooh, how could a black hole destroy us!? Get real. We don't have to sensationalize science to make people interested. Reality is interesting enough, and more important."
4,A Bit Scary,"If our last days on Earth are to be one of the seven ways described in this video, it is indeed scary and something everyone should take note of. It gets down to whether you believe this is the way we'll all go, or will God and Jesus just descend from the heavens and sweep up all Christians as described in the Holy Bible. I'll take the latter any day now."
1,Not to be taken seriously,"I bought this expecting it to be a serious documentary. But I guess reality just wasn`t sensational enough for them. Instead of a documentary, this is more in line with a Michael Moore/Al Gore propaganda film.You should take anything on TV with a grain of salt, but get yourself a salt block for this one."
2,It was not all I expected!,"I mainly bought this DVD for the purpose of watching it with my family especially my parents, they don't understand Inglish and I thought that this DVD had Spanish Subtittle or a way i could of choosen from Inglish to Spanish...On the other hand this dvd was informative to what I didn't know about how the world may end. But the truth is none of us human know when and what time it is going to happen, we may use our computerize knowledge to create a dvd like this one to Emphasize viewers like me.TO: WHO CREATED THIS DVD, PLEASE REMEBER THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WITH OTHER LANGUAGES THAT MAY NOT BUY YOUR PRODUCT CUZ OF THIS ISSUE.>>>>NO OFFENCE<<<<<NO OFFENCE<<<<<<NO OFFENCE<<<<<"
5,Great workouts!,I started on a diet change since July and have lost ten pounds. I started with the walk video and am now doing the whole video and also do the boxing one. My goal is doing both 3 times a week and making them harder gradually and also use weights. These are very good instructions and I always feel good after workout and love George Foreman-he makes me laugh and feel good about myself. Thanks!
1,IGNORE THE RATING--READ THE QUESTION,"Sorry about the rating...I actually don't like it when people give ratings for things unrelated to the quality, but Amazon REQUIRES that you give a rating...........My ""rating"" is for the terrible description ! It says ""ebony"" but I'll bet it is PLASTIC, with ""ebony"" referring to the color. If I am correct, the description should be more accurate or some buyers are going to be very ticked off.If I'm wrong, here is an opportunity for ""Grizzly"" to improve their ad !"
2,not whar I was looking for,"was searching for a specific recording,believed it to be on item ordered,was not-could not seem to get that recording found separately.The title is ""you dropped a bomb on me""-would purchase that item."
1,1 star is way too much for this book!!,This book is USELESS!! I'm so mad I'm stuck with it. I'd feel bad pawning it off on anyone!! Do not buy.....go to your local library if you really want to see how bad it is!!!
4,SING THE BEST OF THE KING!,"* CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE* KENTUCKY RAIN* I WANT YOU, I NEED YOU, I LOVE YOU* IT'S NOW OR NEVERRe-creations in original key and tempo.4 selections in stereo with demonstration vocals.4 selections in stereo without demonstration vocals.Printed lyrics included. (Also lyrics on-screen CD+G)"
3,Jury Still Out,"1st: This is a BIG box of crunchies! 2nd They tasted STALE! I got them to replace Crunchy Cheetos I used to buy in the store. They are nowhere near as ""cheesy"" or ""crunchy"". When I saw the ""sell by"" date was 9/7, about 10 days from when I got them, I was sure they were stale. I did notice though that it took me 3 or 4 times to stop eating them. And by the end of the bag I would say that I like them. So maybe they aren't stale but just taste different than Cheetos. I reserve the right to come back after I have eaten 20 bags of them, and maybe raise my rating."
2,"lots of errors, not the best explanation for the logic games section","I bought this book when I was having problems with the logic games section. I also bought the LSAT logic games bible. The Kaplan book was much less helpful. It's explanations were much less in depth and sometimes incorrect. There were a number of errors on the answer section were some answers were incorrect or the answer in the list didn't match the answer in the explanation. If you are having problems with the logic game section, I would definetly recommend against the Kaplan book, but would recommend the other book highly.I haven't read the other sections of the Kaplan book yet, but I did notice that over half the book is solely practice exams. If you already have the offical past exams, half of this book will be nearly useless for you."
1,Hate to beat a dead horse,"I hate to beat a dead horse, but when that's what you have... My study partner and I both bought this book, among others. Mine is riddled with errors in the second practice set, so we've been correcting it using his. Well, HIS is riddled with errors after the second practice set--DIFFERENT errors than mine! Both books are exactly the same in terms of print years and copyright, etc., etc., etc. How could that happen if the errors are not intentional? I will never, ever buy another Kaplan product, nor will I ever fail to tell everyone I know who's looking for test material about this horror. Your rating system, where reviewers are required to give a book at least one star, is flawed; but how could you have anticipated something like this?"
1,Nothing special.....,"Well, I purchased this book at a bookstore without regretfully reading the reviews on it. This book is waaay expensive for what kind of material you may think it will deliver. Firstly, the CD that comes with it doesn't offer much. You'd think the CD will give you in-depth explanations on logic games. NOPE. It just contains few tests, nothing more. Why spend so much when you can invest your money on something else that has more real tests instead of this. Secondly, the material in the book itself didn't hold my attention for long, especially after reading about how this book contains errors. I actually went ahead and purchased other LSAT Test prep books, leaving this book aside."
2,Not EMR specific,"I would purchase DVD and training if he had better examples.He mentions professional and medical, yet all the examples are just dictated in Microsoft Word.That is not helpful. Base Dragon can do that. Heck even Windows 7 can do that, for free!If he had access to a popular EMR, used by many medical pros, such as EPIC, running in Citrix Receiver, and showing macros, and delayed edit, now we're talking. He would probably sell thousands of copies if he addressed just that single specific market for a lot of medical professionals who 'sink or swim' as he describes.Free advice from someone who is too lazy to take advantage of a market opportunity."
5,A *GREAT* American symphony,"This CD contains some of Rochberg's early works: i.e. before he turned retro. The two chamber works are interesting, but the grand prize here is the Symphony #2, one of the few great American symphonies of the now nearly defunct 20th century. The New York Philharmonic, plays brilliantly under Werner Torkanowsky, hitting a grand slam in what seems to have been his only time at bat in the majors.The symphony is strong and colorful, brimming with muscularity and self-confidence. One wonders what Rochberg would have produced had he not turned onto the path of neo-romanticism."
4,Wonderful!,"What a great book! Really captures the feel of Liverpool and reveals the amazing legacy all of these musicians have left behind. I great history of all the talent that has emerged from the City...from Beatle days to present day. Well written, very descriptive and lively. A MUST to buy for any music fan!"
4,"Sweaty, pounding rock and roll","Calling all Elvis Costello fans! Tired of Elvis collaborating with Burt Bacharach? Longing for a return to the angry geek that scorched everything in sight in the late 70s and early 80s? Well, fear not, because a long lost Elvis Costello album from 1981 has been found! Oh, the name on the cover may say that this is Will Hoge's new album, released in 2001, but this album sound so much like vintage Costello that it's creepy. From the spit-on-the-mike voice to the off-the-beat stammering of the words. The good news is that Will Hoge does Elvis Costello quite well. The album bristles with energy and angst and simply explodes out of the speakers. No studio wizardry here, just 35 minutes of sweaty, pounding rock and roll. Hell, if Elvis won't do it, somebody has to!"
5,Relatives,"I am looking for relatives of the fiddle player, Tom Dickey. I was known in the family as Little Joe. Please email at jdsartain@aol.comThanks"
5,As advertised,"These are as advertised.They measure exactly 6 feet from one end to the other. There are one red and one white female connectors at one end; one red and one white male at the other. They are not so thin as to be easily cut by closing them in a door or such but not quite as thick as I expected. That being said, they work fine to carry the audio signal they are designed to carry. The connectors on both ends work and fit well. think of this product as an audio extension cord.I paid $3.88 including shipping so they are quite affordable. I can recommend them to others."
4,Works great!,Everything works great. It did take a longer than usual ship time. Plugged everything in and it sounds great. Thanks!
4,"Works, but can't be divided.","The cable has a couple of little 'boxes' on it that prevent you from separating the left and right cables any more than they already are, which I found disappointing since I only needed to extend one of the two wires on my speakers. Other than that it works exactly as expected."
5,Cable Extension,"Have a TV game that the cord was to short and needed one the was longer, this product did the trick. If you have a need buy one."
2,An example of post-classic Jones,"The Looney Tunes gang takes on Mark Twain's ""A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court"" in this awkward, tedious Chuck Jones offering. The animation (mostly by veterans Ben Washam and Virgil Ross) is good at times, but the direction is erratic throughout. For diehard Jones fans only."
5,The accidental visionary,"In Maverick, Ricardo Semler has discovered what is the most effective, efficient, fulfilling way to be human not just be an employee or employer. Semler offers not only a model for organisational communication (rather than management), but also a seminal approach to interpersonal relationships at all levels. Oh how I wish education for our young people reflected these processes and valuings. How much more valued and responsible we would all feel. I'm totally sold on Semler's approach. It goes beyond the limitations of representative and participative democracies which demand either majority vote or consensus; both of which have significant disadvantages such as being time consuming and/or alienating. This maverick approach is all empowering and about getting things done responsibly and when they need to be done the way they need to be done. Full marks Ricardo! I have used some of the ideas when working with students and plan to extend my use of the principles."
5,THE must-read for running an innovative buisiness.,Excellent tactics for motivating employees using radical tacticsI was introduced to Semler in my Cornell's MBA Program; best of thethe reading I did in that program regarding how to motivate employeesand how to manage efficiently.
5,Employee Empowerment,"The book ""Maverick"" is the finest example that I have read of a factual transformation of a corporation, to full employee empowerment. David... PhD Candidate"
4,pretty decent read,This was a pretty decent read -- we practice a lot of these at my workplace but I think what this book really shows is the attitude of an entrepreneur.
5,Brilliant Maverick!,I loved the book! It is so close to my own philosophies of business and was completely refreshing and inspiring. I would love to meet Ricardo Semler. He is leading business in a sensible direction.
4,Print studio,"It is a great software,it provides you of printable arts and crafts so beautiful, specially if your daughter is a princess fan."
5,Excellent,Excellent router bits. Plastic box holds them nice and firm. Dont fall out in shipping like the Freuds do. Bits are ultra sharp andcut the dados with no splintering. Well pleased.
5,Undersized Router Bits for Undersized Plywood,"Tired of sloppy fitting plywood shelving in dados? That's because 1/2"" plywood isn't 1/2"" but is 31/64"". These are quality bits with a 1/2"" shank that do the job they are meant for. The sizes are: 15/64"" for 1/4"", 31/64"" for 1/2"" and 23/32"" for 3/4""."
1,cheap,lousy bits. Burned out the 3/4 plywood bit in the first pass 1/2 deep inside another piece of plywood. Purchased a bosch bit as a replacement and has cut the same depth same speed 20 times over and is still sharp! Will never buy CMT again!
3,NOISY............,WORKS GREAT IN MY 2005 JEEP CHEROKEE FITS GOOD AND IS STURDY AND KEEP THE MASTIFF IN THE REAR BUT THE THING IS DRIVING ME NUTS BECAUSE IT RATTLES SO IVE STUCK TOWLES ALL OVER IT AND I STILL GET RATTLES MAYBE MY HUSBAND DIDNT DO IT RIGHT OR ELSE THIS THING IS CRAZY NOISY RATTLING DING DING DING YOU CAN HERE THE METAL SMACKING TOGETHER EVERY LITTLE BUMP
5,Excellent!,"I purchased this last minute to use in my new Kia Sorento (3 days old!). We moved from Ohio to California and have 4 cats/2 dogs. The cats pretty much lived in the back the whole trip. The pet guard stayed secure, not one rattle the whole trip and the dogs in the back seat got to sniff and talk to their cats during the trip.I ended up not using the top extensions in order to get the guard up high enough for cats not to slip through and that worked great. A couple of towels at the edge to ensure they didn't get around it (probably didn't need those!). My only complaint is the instructions are not very good, but the product more than makes up for it! If you need one of these guards, this is well priced, no rattles and stayed in place! I wish everything I bought worked this well!"
4,"Works great, just have to get it tight enough","This thing is exceptionally sturdy, and my dogs aren't quite talented enough (A big ol' Husky and a Collie) to pull it over. However, to get it sturdy you have to make sure it is flush with floor and ceiling, and nice and tight. The downside to this is it can cause little ring marks on the ceiling of car, however a dog drooling onto the back seat/jumping onto the back seat is worse then a ring mark on ceiling of car. So that just comes down to priorities.Shipped quick, went together rather simply (just look at the pictures, not to complicated) and not other issues."
4,Great gate for the money,"Fits well in my '07 Subaru Tribeca, sturdy. Nice that the grating only goes halfway down so I can still lay down a back seat to put something long in if necessary (of course, then the dog can access the back, tho). Took about 30 minutes to install. Nice cup ends on vertical bars won't scratch or rip my interior. Easy to use wing nuts. Be sure to glance thru directions first. They aren't the best, but help. My only suggestion is to center the main piece first before adding the ""wing"" grids. I didn't at first so it wasn't centered halfway thru install, so backtracked and installed it all centered up so it looks good."
4,Just what I needed,"I'm using this in a Subaru Forester to keep my 70lb dog in the back. The instructions were difficult to read, but once we figured it out, it was very easy to assemble. I've had it set up in my car for about a month with no issues."
5,GNI PetShield Standard Mesh Travel Barrier,"We have a Standard Poodle we bought as a puppy who is now a year and a half and 55 pounds. We have a Ford Escape Small SUV. Our dog was getting so close to our backs we decided to look for some sort of barrier. I looked at dog catologs and AMASON. We decided that the GMI PetShield on AMAZON would be the best for us. I was impressed when it arrived, it was very sturdy and easy to adjust for proper fit. What a pleasure to drive and have the safety of the Barrier. The dog got use to it after a couple of trips."
4,Great Dog Barrier,"My husband bought this thinking it would keep the cat in the back of our Santa Fe. Well, it doesn't. It is a well-made gate that would probably work fine with a medium-sized or larger dog, but cats find ways of squeezing through the smallest openings. If we ever get a dog this will work just fine."
4,Great Product,I love the gate - only issue is that it is a little difficult to see through at times. But I love it!
4,Does he job,"Purchased this a month ago and am really likeing the effectiveness of the product. Was easy to install and looks good. I can't quite get the screws tight enough, I have a few rattles with it, but nothing significant, probably just need to adjust it again."
1,Did not work,This product did not sem to fit in my dodge durango. There is no place for the feet to sit between the cargo area and second row of seats
4,"Easy to install, sturdy","We installed this barrier in a Jeep Grand Cherokee. Our goal was to keep the dog from accidentally jumping on the baby :) The barrier was easy to assemble, came with good instructions and seems to be very sturdy as well as highly adjustable. The dog jumped right up and seemed to like 'his space'... give us a month and we'll let you know how the baby likes it. After a lot of researching/looking around, it seems that this barrier is the best you may find for the money!"
5,Great for Prius!,"I have a 2010 Toyota Prius and 2 Jack Russell mixes who love nothing more than to be in the back seat! This works great. It took a little finagling to get it to fit (you do not need the top extenders) but it stays tight, does not rattle at all, is easy to see through and keeps my pups in the trunk! Instructions were clear and easy to follow (and alter to fit!). Couldn't be happier especially for the price! Thanks again Amazon!"
3,Ok,"Easy to assemble but does not have a sturdy base to keep in place. The screws come loose and sometimes it just falls over, especially while going over speed bumps with my dogs in the back and falls on them. For the most part keeps them from jumping up front but a nuisance to have to constantly keep adjusting to stay in place. Not too bad for what it cost though."
3,Ok for the price,"Bought this because the more expensive version was out of stock and I needed a guard in a hurry. It's ok, easy to assemble despite the best efforts of the instruction sheet. Screws are located in exactly the wrong place for my car, as they fit right where the rear headrests are, making them a bit of a b****r to install, but that is vehicle specific. Biggest drawback is that the build quality and solidity are not the best, so there is quite a rattle, and I am very fortunate that my dog is only 50lbs. My old labs would have had this down in a heartbeat. If available and within budget, spring for the more expensive version. A friend of mine has that one, and it is worth the price differential."
3,Ok,Item is a little flimsy. My dog can push through it. It rattles as you are going down the road. Fast shipping.
4,Excellent product,Easy to install on my Chevy Equinox - keeps my 100 # Doberman in the back of the SUV. Sometimes can slide a little since it's on a removable liner but not a major problem.
3,"seems well-made, didn't fit vehicle","I was looking for a barrier for my Mini Cooper Clubman. Based on measurements, this one seemed like it would fit -- but it doesn't, because of the shape of the barrier and of the car.It seemed well-made and the instructions, while not great, were fine. For larger vehicles, it should be a fine solution."
5,Perfect for any vehicle size,We got our pet barrier after searching for one in my city not able to find even a used one under one hundred dollars. So I was quite happy to order this at a fraction of the price. It's perfectly in our 08 grand Cherokee. It doesn't rattle it would fit a wider or bigger or smaller vehicle. It's perfect for our 30lb dog and doesn't obstruct our rear view.
5,Great product.,This barrier is fantastic. We got this for our car so our two dogs don't jump from the cargo to the backseat with our newborn. Easy to put in and very sturdy. Worth every penny.
5,Best for wagon,"I looked at several different barriers, and bought and returned one, before I found this one. Fits great in my 2001 Taurus wagon (aka The Dog Bus), whereas most of these barriers are made to fit SUVs. Rattles very, very little compared to the first wire type I got (need wire because of my terrier). Great solution at a great price."
4,"As a multimedia device, lots of fun","Good price for a MP3 player, and a quick time movie maker.I got one for playing with Internet. It's so good so far. Not only it's so easy to handle to make a quick time movie, but also a good MP3.For sure, this toy give you lots of fun.One thing you may consider that is not so good for shoot a pic, but your pic is for computer using only, it's still OK."
5,best camcorder under $200,"They should call this the MC1 because it's only useful as a camcorder. As a camcorder that is $120, it gets 5 stars. Everything else out there that is <$200 are ALL 10 frames per second. They claim to be cool but are extremely choppy and look like web cams. A TV is 30fps, movie theaters are 24fps and the MC3 is 20fps. Not perfect buy light years ahead of everything else. Yes it has other problems but nothing that the exact other brands don't have too. Face it; this is the best camcorder you are going to get for <$200. If you like choppy web cam action it will record in 10fps and give you 4X more recording. A 16mb card (included) will give you 1:17min @ 20fps, and a 256mb card will give you 20:06min @20fps. You should buy a 256mb card ($60 ebay) and at least 6 rechargeable AAA batteries + recharger ($25) I've spent days trying to find something better than this and still can't. This is the best of a the junk that is out there. If that means anything."
1,Please dont go in for this unless u get it dirt cheap,I am so disappointed with the product that I am trying hard to get rid of this 3-in-1 combo . It does none of these 3 jobs in any credible manner.Well photos are kind of polarized (multi colored).Dont know why but the picture quality has degraded to absymal levels(i mean in 6 months).I bought this product for around 350 US$(in India ) and now terribly regret the decision. It plays mp3s well but it makes no sense to carry a cam to listen to music .No comments on movie cam.totally flawed product!!!
3,Fun and simple!,"This is a decent little camera/videorecorder/MC3 device that is definitely not in the same league as the 'big boys', but is easy to use and a lot of fun. It takes photos and movies that are OK for web purposes (e-mails, eBay, etc.) and for casual use.One of the more fun uses is to record a short 'video note'- sort of like a digital tape recorder with moving images!I can understand the frustration of the 'low raters', especially if they paid the original retail price- (everything they say about it is true!)- but with the various used and refurbished deals, it is a good value!"
4,Great Product for the high school set,"I bought this product for my daughter for her birthday in September and she doesn't go anywhere without it! It is simply fabulous for quick video shots at the prom (only with LOTS of light!!), carrying tunes on a field trip or catching friends doing crazy things during band rehearsal. My daughter had the software up and running in about 10 minutes and had none of the problems others have reported here. I am buying her a larger media card for Christmas because her current 64 mg card is not always big enough to carry tunes out on a field trip and picture back from the trip without having to blow away the tunes.It is just the right size, just the right price and meets all of her needs for a video camera, digital camera and MP3 player. I think that this is such a great product that I bought three additional players for additional gifts."
2,liked video but not the rest,"I actually liked the video part of this camera. That was cool. Had trouble getting the camera to acknowledge the smart card was in the camera as it kept telling me that it wasn't. Did not like the software at all. I always have trouble with Quick Time freezing up my computer. The still pictures were OK but I miss a viewfinder, that little LED display just isn't enough. I like the USB cable and the battery life is good. If they gave it a viewfinder or a bigger LED it would help a lot."
2,"good concept, flawed follow-through","the camera itself works great, and it's a great idea. the mp3 samples pre-loaded onto the device sound great with a regular cd player tape adapter in the car. however, i could not get my computer to connect to the device. i even bought a USB port because my computer (a beige mac g3) didn't have one. and still, nothing. i'm on the fence whether to return it or not because i do really like the camera itself, and i'm hoping i can get it to work, but i'm not very optimistic about it. i'm wondering if it has compatibility problems with computers that aren't exactly new (despite fitting all the system requirements)."
4,Kodak mc3 software is miserable. I have a solution.,Kodak mc3 is great and does what it promises very well. But the bundled software is a shame. (...)
1,Faulty Product,"I bought these lamps to replace some dim factory bulbs in an S-10 Pickup. They were notably brighter, but only lasted 3 months before they both failed. Do not recommend buying this product."
2,Peter Green? An Occasional Vocal. Guitar? I Doubt It.,"This album should be titled ""Splinter Group With Peter Green On Occasional Raspy Vocal And Phantom Guitar (Because Nigel Watson Probably Plays Most If Not All The Lead & Rhythm Parts), But We'll Use Green's Name Just To Sell The Album Even Though His Involvement Is Minimal At Best; And Peter Green, Who Penned Such Classic As 'Oh Well', 'Black Magic Woman' & 'Rattlesnake Shake' Did Not Even Write One Song On The Entire Album"". All I get from repeated listenings is disappointment and a deep longing of what should of and could have been. RIP ""Green God""."
4,Peter Green's Blues,"On May 15th I had the incredible pleasure to see Peter & the group play live. Absolutely one of the best shows I've seen in a long time! These guys played the first four tunes from this cd over two sets and I have to admit they sound better live. Nigel Watson's vocals are a perfect compliment to Peter's guitar work. Peter Stroud and Larry Tolfree add a strong rhythym section to keep the tempo. And then there's Roger Cotton, strong songwriting, great keyboards and a sly sense of humor. All in all a very tight band that clearly has great material in them to come. Finally, let me state to those critics of Peter's guitar work these days....GO SEE HIM LIVE! He makes it look so effortless that you will be amazed. A great cd and a great band live. Welcome back Peter!P.S. This is the only 60's icon I've ever seen sign autographs after the show. A very humble man. Thanks!"
5,Well Worth It...,"I have only five words: This is a great cd. Ok, maybe more. This is one of the best albums I have heard all year and I would highly reccommend it to anyone that likes good pop/rock music with thoughtful, introspective vocals. I can't say Starter Kit sounds like any particular band, because they have cultivated their own sound and perfected it. Their sound is highly original and I imagine this album will remain in my cd changer for quite some time. ""Failsafe"", ""Vicarious"" and ""Cold Shower"" are three wonderfully written pop songs that layer snappy beats and just enough edgy guitars beneath vocal melodies that I have found myself humming and not even realizing it. Five stars... these guys are great!"
3,A bit too heavy for travel,I'm a backpacker and I figured this would be perfect for storing my passport and money at night in the dorms. The product seems sturdy and is a good size but it is pretty heavy if you are going to carry it with you.
5,Just what I was hoping for,"This is small enough to keep in my purse, but large enough that i can put my meds, wallet... Inside.The quality is good, and it's very simple to use. Five stars."
4,great for travelling,"unfortunately when I ordered it I thought it was the one with the combination as I'm sure that's what I had selected! In any case, nice product, perfect size for travelling am very happy with it and look forward to bringing it with me to Dominican!"
2,Good safe except for lock,The safe serves its purpose except one day I realized that using a simple flat head screw driver or flat pocket knife blade could easily turn the lock if jiggled for a minute.
2,pricey,"I found this product to be useful and convenient for my Agency purposes; however, upon ordering for a month the price jumped almost double; needless to say, I will be finding another Lockbox for my Agency."
1,It's Been Cancelled,"After a silence of well over a year and a half, a moderator on the official forums announced""It has been officially confirmed - SWAT 4 (which is slated to use the Unreal2 engine; it is also official that Urban Justice, as was, has been cancelled) has been postponed, indefinitely.""It's too bad- if they'd made this game anything like SWAT3 it would have been great.Don't get your hopes up for a sequel to SWAT3- if there ever is one it'll be a long time before it emerges. Think Team Fortress 2."
5,He won't stop playing it!,"I bought this game for my husband for Christmas, as well as the expansion pack, and he won't stop playing it! He has owned all of the other Swat games in the past and says this one is his favorite by far. I haven't played it myself, but he says it's worth every star it can get!"
3,SWAT 4,"Graphics is good but the AI and the gameplay needs a little comment.1st , we always get penalized if we saw a suspect and did not have them disarm without usind deadly force ! And a lot of time you see a suspect with guns and you have to shout several time for him to obey your orders ! but the split second he don;t he get you wounded ! very annoying.The sniper control is a joke ! you have to ALWAYS go to the sniper and take the shot and leave your team vulnerable to attack when the sniper see s suspect! No illuminated rectical on the scope also! so in dark spot, you cannot see the rectical!Overall, game play is okay! but I wish they would improve on thje game play and AI!"
3,Need a serious re-work on A.I.,"The game is the best of series, but really need to improve de A.I. Sometimes it really pisses off the DUMB things that your team do without your command putting in risk all mission. Another thing that irritates is the ""UNAUTHORIZED USE OF FORCE"" penalty. Even swat being a organization that SAVES and do not TAKE lives,if you order a suspect to surrender and he run away...you CAN'T SHOOT ? this is ridiculous. If the suspect get back and fire you it's ok, but if you fire him it's not. On the other hand, the game is fan, the graphics are regular and it's very playable."
1,Will I ever get it?,"SWAT 3 is an amazing tactical game. As a 2yr member of the Sheriff's office, I loved the strategy, AI, and graphics of this game. When I found that Urban Justice was going to be released, I put my order in. July 2002, it was going to be released in September, I paid in advance. September came and went and I found that it would be January of 2003 before I could receive the game. Six months later, I found that March 2003 would be the release date. Aggravated and ready to ask for a refund, March came and I find that June 2003 is the new release date. Almost a year after I dropped more than fifty bucks on it. SWAT Urban Justice better be the be-all-end-all of video games. In the meantime, I'm cancelling my order and will just get it probably about ten bucks cheaper when I find it in Sam Goody or some other store."
5,She remembers for us to remember...,"In the epilogue, Loung thanks her editor, because she's says without the editing, we'd all be reading a much longer book. In this case, I would love to read ""the much longer book"".... I can't say enough positive about the book, even though I know it has received criticism. It's a first hand account of the same stories I've heard first hand over.. Stories that deserve to be retold so that hopefully they never have to be experienced again. Whether you are an academic with an interest in Cambodia / Southeast Asia or the casual reader, you will be haunted a young girl's life.. in "" First They Killed My Father"".[...]"
3,"Monotonous, overly dramatized, yet authentic and very moving","Realized the scale of genocide in Cambodia after reading the book. Surely what happened to the author is very moving and tragic. Thousands and millions of others have suffered similar fates.Positives of the book are that it seems very authentic. Lucid style of writing keeps the reader engaged. Felt very moved at various junctures.Negative, mainly, is that the book is overly dramatic. It is hard to imagine someone at 6 years of age having so many complex thoughts. Perhaps author felt those thoughts later in life.Also, not the book to understand the history or the reasons for the conflict. Book is purely a personal memoir. So mid way through the book, it tends to get monotonous."
4,Impressive account of brutal times.,"This book retraces the horrific few years of a Cambodian family's struggle to survive Pol Pot's repressive regime. It is told through a young girl's eyes and is written in a simple manner. It is quite a riveting read and don't be surprised to find yourself wanting to extract these people from the situation they are in. You get to know the entire family of seven children and their parents so well, they feel like they are part of yours. And even though this is the story of one family, so many others are similar.Whether you know much of the history of Cambodia or not, you should read this book because this history should be part of everyone's education. It may not prevent other similar situations (as we have witnessed since then), but one can always hope..."
3,How much can a 5 year old remember?,"This is a good book. It portrays the Khmer Rouge horrors through the eyes of a five year old child. Having spent time in Cambodia, I find the book presents a clear and accurate snapshot of Khmer life; however, there's no way a five year old could recall the facts presented in such incredible detail. I recommend, therefore, that you read this as a cursory overview. Clearly, life in Cambodia was hell then (it isn't much better now). I suspect, however, that this author collected impressions from a wide variety of people and compiled them into a book for which she takes credit."
1,Embarrassment,"This book is an embarassment to Cambodians and insulting to our experience. As a Cambodian, I could see the many flaws and fabrications in the story. I was very disappointed by this book."
4,Review,"This is a novel that will open your eyes and have you think about the things you take advantage of and the people you ""love"". In this novel, Loung uses metaphors that have you think and puts you in situations like you're actually there. Never would i think a novel could do this. The Khmer Rouge is a major factor in this novel. The Khmer Rouge have changed Lounge's life"
4,A Great Place to Start,"Loung Ung writes with lucidity and passion, not only the history of a childhood damaged by war, but of the very real consequences of totalitarian regimes on human life itself. While Ung talks quite a bit about the political climate of her native Cambodia, the focus of the book is definetly the day to day realities of the people of Cambodia during the Pol Pot regime. For anyone interested in learning more about Cambodia and its trials in the modern era and the impact of war on its amazing culture, this book is a must read."
3,Opened my Eyes,Heard the author over the radio reviewing her book. It caught my interest where I normally would have not read a book like this. This book will stay with me as a reminder of how terrible the war was.
5,You Don't Know How Good You Have It Until You Read This One.,"I think someone recommended this book to be about six months ago while I was visiting Colorado Springs. I was quite moved by this story from the eyes of a child amid such horror in the Cambodian-stricken country enduring war, havoc, and famine. While it is a sad story about family...in the end...it's such a relief to know that Loung Ung, the author, was finally saved by an American sponsor to come to the USA-Vermont. And what a beautiful place Vermont is...from one culture shock to another. Great book! It's a reminder to us all...that the basics in life are what really matter: food, shelter, clothing, love!"
3,"War damages everyone, especially young children.","""First They Killed My Father"" is a story based on the recollections of young Loung Ung. She was five years old when her family was forced from their home in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. What follows is four years of sorrow as she travels between villages and camps - sometimes with her family, sometimes on her own. She eventually escapes with a brother to Thailand and then the United States.I didn't find it a difficult book to read. The writing was simple, told in the present tense, and in the voice of young Loung. From what I've learned since, there are some glaring inaccuracies in her account. I'd imagine these can be attributed to her age at the time, and the fact that it she waited twenty-five years to write it. Regardless, it points out again how damaging war is on everyone, but especially young children."
4,A book everyone should read,"From 1988 to 1990 I was living and working in Cambodia with OXFAM UK. It was almost daily that I was told, by my Cambodian collegues/friends, accounts of the killings and suffering that took place during the Khmer Rouge time. When I read Loung Ung's book, I felt as though I was back in Cambodia, being told another experience that emotionally tears one's heart apart. I can not comprehend how a child at that age would be able to deal with such brutalities and loss of parents and siblings.Loung Ung's book describes, through a personal account, an historical period in Cambodia that needs to be remembered and told. I would hope that, through reading of this book, our society would become more aware and compassionate towards others. Loung Ung's book is a must to be read by all."
4,Recommended...,"""First They Killed My Father"" is Loung Ung's gripping tale of her survival of the Cambodian holocaust. Born to middle class parents, Ung was living a happy childhood in Phnom Penh when the Khmer Rouge rolled in in April 1975. Soon her family, and all city dwellers, were driven out into farming villages to work in labor camps. The family splits up for various reasons, and some don't survive.This memoir is written from an innocent perspective -- a child's understanding of what is going on around her. It was my first introduction to the Cambodian holocaust and as such is lacking as a comprehensive portrait of all that went on. The political buildup and philosophy of the Khmer Rouge are touched on, but not exhaustively. Other books (and movies such as ""The Killing Fields"") are available for that. This is a moving and well written account and I recommend it."
5,One of the best books I have read in years...,"This story really opened my eyes to what happend in Cambodia. It tells the story of young Loung Ung and her family. This book showed me that anything can happen to any one, and to never take any thing for grantid. I would love to meet Loung, she is truely an inspiring person."
4,First they killed my father; a daughter of Cambodia,I enjoyed the story but shuddered at the horrors this family suffered. It was interesting to read about Cambodia during this time period. I would recommend this book for those interested in true historical novels.
5,Quite moving a must read for anyone interested in Cambodia,"I completed the book in one day itself is testimony of the book. I was really moved , cried . The book shows Cambodia through the prism of a child. I was not able to stop reading the until the end. It kind shows sheer determination of the author and her family to stand and fight against all odds.I thank the author for the memoir an eye opener to everyone for humanity.The book starts with a brief introduction of family and continues the hardships encounter by the family during the period (covers a lot details and insights)."
3,Impressive detail,"At the age of 9, the author had lost immediate family members, worked in intensive labour camps, militarily trained, witnessed barbaric executions and everything that shreds all human dignity. There is some gratification in her survival, but that it took over four years to curb the inhumanity to over 1.5 million people is tragic and also that similar events have repeated since then.Her memoir hits home with its harsh detail, which is often necessary to sensitize us to a foreign land and its people.Written through the senses of a young child and as a memoir, the language and style is too simple and the book lacks the historical, social and political perspectives that could have made it a more compelling narrative."
5,"Amazing, moving story","First They Killed My Father is a compelling story of security, destruction, hope and survival. Apart from the specifics of location and time, this is simply a great read. That the story is true, and that it is recent, only makes it more compelling.I did not pick up the book because of an interest in Asia, or in the politics and history of Cambodia. I read the book because it sounded interesting; the book did not dissapoint.It is a classic story, someone happy becomes unhappy, faces extreme odds, and in the end finds happiness again. The success of the book is in the telling of this tale, in its immediacy and sheer presence.For those interested in Pol Pot and Cambodian history, I imagine this is a good book to read. For those of us interested in reading good stories, written well, this is a great book."
4,Few of Us Have Walked In Her Shoes,"This book tore at my heart strings like no other I have read on the topic of genocide. I live and work in Cambodia and have heard similar stories over and over again from Khmer survivors of the Pol Pot period. But reading this poignant account made me realize so deeply what hell the people of Cambodia suffered through. When one reads what Loung went through you cannot help but be in awe of her survival skills and how strongly the whole family struggled to survive. What amazed me was the realization that this hell went on for not months or a year but for around three years for this family. This book is simply written, but be prepared to weep for this young woman and her family."
3,Summary of First They Killed My Father,This book is about how a little girl named Loung went through the horrors of being in the Pol Pot movement. Throughout teh movement she faces difficult obstacles in order to keep herself and family out of danger. However one day in the book Loung's family dies of slowly and painfully. Loung later moves and grow to live in America. Fisrt The Killed My Father takes place in Cambdoia during the 1900's. The book is also a further look into the Khmer Rouge develoment.Important scene:The scene that meant the most to me was when Loung's dress was burning in the fire. This symbolized the fire wall o fteh Pol Pot movement.Recommendations;I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about Cambodia and teh Po Pot Movement
5,Great product,"I love this product! I have super thin, dry hair. The CHI keratin mist made it silky and shiny. It doesn't look dull now and it's so much healthier. I definitely recommend :)"
5,good 4 hair spray,"I have big, curly, wavy hair. Curly hair is more brittle than straight because of the twists and turns, and i have highlights. This product smells good to me and more importantly it really helps stop the breakage especially in the front."
3,Frizzy hair,I gave it a 3 because it is what I wanted but it does make my hair frizzy. I have made up a solution that includes this product and my hair stays straight and now I can use it everyday.
4,Keeps hair strong,I love this and use it in addition to my It's a 10 leave in treatment. My hair stylist noticed the difference. My hair doesn't break nearly as much as it used to.
2,Not a good product,"Me, my son and my mother in law , the three of us tried this product but it is not good at all, it made our hair worse. It dries the hair after a long time of trying it."
2,Smells like men's cologne!,"I was excited to find this product at such a great price, until I sprayed it in my hair. I am not too sure, but I don't think this is supposed to smell like men's cologne. It doesn't do anthing good or bad to my hair, but I worry about the strong smell. This makes me think it's not really what it says it is, and that it has tons of alcohol which is terrible for your hair."
2,i wouldnt use it again...,"it feels good at first, but after it dries i feel like if i run my hand through my hair it will break. never again."
3,Not Worth the Flakes,"This leave in treatment is great for cutting down straightening time. I was surprised how fast I was able to do my hair and how shiny and frizz-free it was.... BUT, after 2 weeks of using this product before straightening, I started to get horrible dandruff that my scalp is still recovering from. It might just be my scalp that got this reaction... but just be careful with this stuff."
4,"Just a spritz for soft, shiny hair","It's a great, light conditioner that leaves my sometimes dry hair soft, shiny and easy to manage without weighing it down."
5,A light product to tame unruly hair!,"I had previously used the Chi Silk Infusion, which I like, to tame my curly hair and keep away flyaways. But I found it to be a little heavy. I had checked a review elsewhere on this product and the Keratin Mist and the reviewer had preferred the Mist. So I decided to try it out. I am not disappointed. I find it gives my hair good hold when I straighten it. And it is much lighter so hair does not feel greasy or goopy. Go ahead and mist away!"
4,great hair stuff,This is really great stuff. My hairdresser uses it on us when we go there but they sell it for around $60 a bottle. Sure has made morning hairbrushing with my daughter a much better experience. We were on the verge of cutting her long hair off so it has helped make for better days.
2,Not a fresh clean smell,Not a fresh clean smell. It smells like the cheap 99 cents cologne where u can find at almost any 99 cents store. It doesn't even work as good as the real chi keratin spray. This spray doesn't even work. It's like putting perfumed water to the hair.
2,It's Just OK,"I wouldn't buy this one again, it takes way too long to see any form of results on your hair. It has a nice scent, but the scent does not last, and my hair was still plagued with breaks and splits even after using this one for over a month.The only thing I liked about it was that after a shower, if I sprayed it in my hair, my hair would dry a lot faster than it normally does. I am talking time being cut in half, literally. Should be re-named- wet hair fast dry spray, because for me that is all it does."
3,Not for flat ironing,I bought this in hopes that it would help with the constant breakage from the flat ironing...not so sure that I like it any more than the other OTC stuff that I have been using.
5,Great Product,My hair has really improved since using this product. It' shinier and more manageable. I'm very happy with this product but I'm not a fan of the scent. Really works :)
3,White Man's Burden,"Nine short stories, each told in first person, and each about a traveler to a foreign culture which they find both fascinating and baffling. These take place all over the world -- in China, France, Japan, Brazil, a First American reservation and others -- told with a long litany of unfamiliar place-names.There's a certain air of cultural imperialism in the stories though, as the protagonist of each describes his or her reactions to the indigenous culture without ever adopting or accepting the culture. It is assumed that the culture will adapt to the central character rather than vice versa. In this way the stories are never about 'fitting in' but more about 'sticking out.' The central voice, a sincere but somewhat hardened personality, varies little from story to story, despite wildly varying circumstances. In the end I found the 'resistance' of the real author to any kind of role-playing somewhat off-putting."
2,Cheap case,"This case is cheaply built, you are definitely getting what you pay for here. I am waiting for it to break before I buy my son a more solid case for his ipod. Not impressed at all with the case, but for the price I can't expect much."
2,Disappointed,The clip will not stay clipped to whatever you may have it attached to. For example; getting in and out of a seated position the clip will not hold and the case will hit the ground coming open and perhaps damaging your IPod. The clip also comes apart from the case periodically causing the case to hit the ground.
1,bad,"poorly designed, the back piece broke within a day. I wish I never bought it. If i were new to this product I wouldnt get it"
2,Consider the size very carefully,"I was thrilled with this product and don't really care if the belt clip breaks off (per other reviews.) I guess all I saw was ""iPod classic with video"" and the photos. I have a classic 160 GB and it is heart breaking how close this case comes to closing but if I force it, the hinges will likely break. Unfortunately, I will be returning it."
5,Ipod 5G Metal enclosure case,"Case was better than expected, closes/opens easily, no snapping noise when closing, included felt inner lining will definitely continue to protect my metal shine on the back of my Ipod Video 5G as if new and there was even an extra piece included so if I get a newer one it will fit this case as well. Clip looks sturdy and ready to go. Would recommend for purchase to protect a legacy device or a new one.CTA Digital Hard Case with Belt Clip for iPod classic 5G, 5.5G (Silver)"
1,Do Not Buy,This product does not fit the described iPod in title. I bought this for my 5th generation 60GB iPod video and it did not fit. Do not buy if you have that generation iPod.
4,Great way to protect your iPod w/ Video,"This was exactly what I wanted for my iPod. It fits perfectly (there's a felt ""spacer"" for the 30Gb iPod; I presume it fits the 60Gb iPod without the spacer). The aluminum case with the built-in hard plastic window provides great protection.I'm giving this 4 stars because I'd be hesitant to go jogging with it. The belt clip isn't all that rugged, and the case doesn't seem to latch closed super securely, so I'd be worried about it popping open. But for general use, this is perfect."
5,Perfect,"All around good case. Fits well, comes with built-in screen protector, and comes with swivel belt clip. Impressed"
2,Bulky case w/ Horrible Belt Clip,The case is strong yet bulky. Yet it's protective but it takes away from the slim sleek feel of the ipod. I can get over the bulky part. The part that makes me wish I could return it- the belt clip broke within 3 weeks. I bough it so I could use my ipod at the gym needless to say it is now worthless and I'm disappointed.
2,Case is fine - Clip is TOO cheap,"After only a week of having this item the belt clip broke off. The case works fine to protect the ipod, but I bought this so I could clip it on while at the gym, so is no longer any good to me. When the clip was on it, it also very freely swiveled, and would move around when I wore it, should have a click feature so you can keep it in one spot. Save your money and buy a better one, instead of having to just buy another one in a week."
2,Bulky and it do not close tight,"But what do you wnat for a cheap item?It looks great. Yet, it won't close tight. Also it has a bulky piece on the back, in case you want to attach the included belt clip."
3,"Nice case, bad belt clip","I have 2 of these and the belt clip broke on both. I got it because it had a belt clip but after the first one fell off my hip and tumbled to the ground, flinging my brand-new iPod Classic to the sidewalk, I learned a lesson. The second one just got loose and I knew to check it before use. It's a structural flaw because all the stress goes to one little plastic part, which fails easily. If you don't care about the belt clip feature, it's a nice case. If you do want to use a belt clip, look at Marware."
1,It is Not Swirly,This item here will not be sent to you if you order it.Instead of the swirly lined wire it is regular wired.
4,Kodak Digital Camera,The price was great for this digital camera at under $100. It has very good features for an inexpensive camera and will work well with the docking unit the recipient already has.
2,Good Starter Camera,A good starter camera. If you never used a digital camera before this one is for you. Easer to operate then a film camera turn the dial to auto and snap away. I got it for our 8 year old she mastered it and was taking pictures in five minutes an older women relative who never even seen one before was Abel to master it in two.It doesn't have all the gadgets or settings that the others have but that is part of it's appeal for older or younger picture takers. If you can use a film camera you can use this digital. You might even be able to use this one if you cant figure out a film camera. And it takes just as good a picture as most film cameras.In short if you have been scared to go digital because you don't think you can figure out how to use it this one is for you.
2,No zoom!,"Kodak easyshare cameras are the way to go with digital, in my opinion. Easy to use and all kodaks work the same. However, this model does not have a zoom! I purchased it, unknowingly, and discovered this fact when I got it home. Spend a few more bucks and get the C533!! I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my younger brother and I know he will love it."
3,"Too many ""soft"" pictures","A good point-and-shoot camera. My only complaints are that if you use the zoom AT ALL (even in bright daylight outside), the pictures are not crisp. You really have to be less than 6 feet from the subject and do not use the zoom feature if you are further away than that. Also, the flash is very weak and indoor pictures are not good quality (again, unless you are right up close to the subject)."
2,No lens cover,"Another reviewer mentioned this, but for some reason this camera lacks a lens cover (either an automatic or manual mechanism). There is a small sheet of clear plastic covering the actual lens, but if you were to carry the camera around in your pocket, or bag, this plastic cover would get scratched quickly.Because of this, the C530 would probably be good to keep in the house, and take out for indoor pictures on special occasions or something. It would NOT be a good ""carrying-around"" camera for daily use, despite its relatively small size."
2,No es lo que aparente,"El producto es de muy bajas caracteristicas.Material barato, zoon de baja calidad, en otras palabras es sumamente inferior a otros equipos que he probado los cuales se encuentran en el mismo rango de precios.Kodak tiene una linea de Camaras económicas las cuales paracen ser desechables.No lo recomiedo."
1,Susan's Opinion of the Kodak 530,"The Kodak 530 is not as clear as I expected. The picture does not have the clarity that my Kodak CX4200 have which is only 3 megapixels. The CD that places the Easy Share program on my computer picks the 530 up as a 315. Nothing in the camera references the camera as being a 530. 530 is printed on the outside of the camera only.I loved the Kodak CX4200 which was lost at a reunion (3 megapixels), so I thought the 530 would be a better camera with 5 megapixels but not so.)I really can't be sure the camera is 530 since the computer reads it as a 315."
1,it was broken by the time i got it,"i was so exited to get the camera that, so qouck that when i opened it, the screen was already broken , so much 4 a cute camera"
2,No video sound!,We bought this for our daughter and I am very disappointed that it does not record sound with the videos! It was not clearly indicated that I could find on the box or manual that it did not do this!
3,You get what you pay for,"I Bought three of these camera's for my business. I needed them to be able to take and store large quantities of pictures, so I ordered a few 2.0GB SD cards only to find out that this camera ""IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH 2 GB SD MEMORY CARDS; your camera accepts a maximum 1 GB SD card"". That should be listed with the technical details. It doesn't even say that on the box or in the Users Manual, I got the info from that website. STUPID...The camera is fine for the basics, I would equate it to a disposable film camera."
3,Good,"The camera is reasonably priced, easy to operate and the clarity of pictures is good. The service I received when I faced a problem with the camera was decent and they replaced it with a new one in the warranty period."
2,not a good camera for me,i bought this camera thinking hey pictures too. i bought the docket to. now don't get me wrong i love kodak cameras but this one is terible the software messed my computer up but i gave it 2 stars because it does take good pictures but next time i buy a kodak it is going to be with out a docket they are to much trouble.i love kodak but this one has been a night mare. in process of sending it back. i am sure i just got a bad one because i have had them before but i would not buy this one. just my opinion. but i will get another one because of all the cameras kodak is the best for me just not this one i tend to spend a little more but hey they are worth it.
3,"A toy camera, but the price... cheap!","When I recieved this camera I seems bought a toy, the plastic body wasn't solid and well. The screen is very small."
3,"Solid, Inexpensive Camera",Produces pictures capable of enlargement. Very easy to use in Auto Mode. Quite satisfied!
4,Good camera for personal use,"This is a great camera for around the house and family gettogethers. There are really no cons for this camera, except that there is no lens cover, which probably wont ever be a problem for most people. It takes great photos, and the flash has plenty of power, even from across a room (for those who said it didn't, please adjust your exposure comp. in the menu). It has a pretty good shutter speed too, it only delays about a second between pictures. It's also better on batteries than most digital cameras i've used."
4,"For a cheap camera, not bad.","This camera is great if you want something to toss in your purse/pocket and take out to a party, or for simple snapshots. The flash is really bright and there isn't a lense cap, so you should get a little case for it. The screen in very clear and the timer is helpful."
4,"wonderful photos, not as many picture modes","this little camera is great. the moment i got it, it was ready to be used right out of the box! this is perfect for a person like me. I am young so i want to carry it everywhere in my purse, its light, and very easy to use. I really didnt need the user manual that much. I would recommend this camera! the only thing I dont like is that it doesnt have as meany photo settings, ei. landscape, sport, and the video doesnt have audio. but other than that, this camera is great!"
3,Very Elementary,"I purchased this for my daughter, but was not very impressed with it. It was very elementary. Although it is very easy to use, I had hoped it had a little more extras. biggest dissapointment was not sound with the video. I have since given it to my niece and purchased another for my daughter, with upgrades."
1,Picture quality poor,"The pictures are grainy, not as good quality as my old 4 MP EasyShare. I was disappointed, but wanted to make sure, so I compared the photo quality side by side onscreen of the new 5 MP C530 with my old 4MP EasyShare (using the same subject). The 4 MP has better resolution than the new 5MP C530, which is not what you'd expect. Kodak unfortunately seems to have taken a step backwards with this camera, and is advertising this as a higher quality camera than the old 4 MP EasyShare. Too bad, as I've used Kodak for years, but will look elsewhere now. I returned the C530 to Amazon the same day I bought it."
3,kodak c530,This is a good camera. the only problem I have with it is that the video doesnt take sound and that isnt something the site specifies. It also eats batteries.
1,awful pictures,The flash on this camera doesn't go off when it should and even when it does the pictures are dark and blurry. I have a kodak camera with 4MP that is three years old and it takes far better pictures. Don't buy this camera. If you want a kodak upgrade to a better model. This camera is not worth even the cheap price.
1,Sadly Out of Date and Inaccurate,"The book begins on an incorrect premise and goes downhill from there. The basis for the authors' assertion that there were ""traditionally"" 80 cards in a Tarot deck is faulty. There are two blank cards because of the constraints of the printing process, not because of any arcane significance. The authors seem unaware of the wealth of knowledge gained through recent Tarot research. They lack historical method, and make strange leaps from the factual to the speculative, often presenting fancy as fact. The result is an indigestible mass of highly dubious ""scholarship"". It is hard to see how this book ever made it into print."
3,meh,"It felt good but didn't seem to help the actual problem. You could just as easily buy a bottle of Witch Hazel and pour it on some T.P. and get the same, but cheaper, effect."
5,Stay clean,"I've been using these for years, to clean that not so clean spot. It works very well and also helps with hemorrhoids."
3,No sealing,"I bought like 8 of these and I was disappointed to see that the jars are not sealed with an aluminium film or whatever. We are talking about personal hygiene here.The quality is the same with the ones made by Anusol(R), except that those have a sealing.With a sealing, this would be a 5+ stars product. The price is excellent."
5,Read review at your own risk! MUST HAVE FOR PREGNANT LADIES,"I recently had a baby, before I had her I asked my mom what were things that she had before she went to the hospital. She told me about these, and how she would put these on her pads after birth to help soothe all my woman parts (haha.) But it really did help. The slight cooling effect and the witch hazel made the first few days after labor not so bad!"
5,Love it,"this is good product, my mother has hemorrhoids internal and external more than 10 years, it helped her with many others products"
1,Do not buy,"Should have listened to all the other reviews, but I thought they must have been flukes. Nope--this product arrived open and WET. So gross. By open, I mean that the lid was on but the protective seal had been removed, or maybe there never was any (but that seems strange and unlikely to me). HOWEVER, Amazon was great about refunding my money without even making me return the damaged product. Very happy with Amazon. Just not with this product."
4,Good buy,Cheaper to get these than to buy bottled witch hazel. I used these after giving birth and they're nice if you put them in the fridge for a cooling effect.
4,Philosophy supplements neuroscience,"I am a management scientist trying to understand decision making. My efforts have included readings on neural science that evidenced significant advancements in understanding the physical and biological properties of the mind. However, Modell offers an encompassing rational perspective how 'metaphor' describes the underpinnings of the mind. I found Modell's philosophical perspective to be a helpful in integrating the findings of other academics."
3,6 sheets NOWAY ; but it is safe and durable,"3-4 sheets slows this unit to a crawl. Credit cards are even scarier. The safety features are well done.for light duty its good but not well priced.UPDATE 12/24/2010: I was contacted by the manufacturer citing the design of the unit and design capacity which I found to be a favorable action for a company who support their products.It still works fine though I must admit I am a little disappointed with every shredder I have used.After that admittance I would recommend these shredders as better units in the field, though I clearly would be happier with one that had a V8 engine :-J.These are fine for home use.I upped my rating to 3 stars for durability."
1,A piece of junk,"Bad from day one. Can't handle more than one or two sheets of paper at a time (though it claims six), and even then starts to jam and overheat after three minutes or so. By comparison, I had my previous shredder for seven years of near-perfect operation (had to leave it behind in a move). Strongly recommend that Fellowes simply take this product off the market."
2,Safety feature is very good!,"I like the safety features in this. As a paper shredder it may not impress any one. Not worth the money. Cannot handle even four sheets of 22lb paper. 5 sheets had jammed it. Usable with a maximum of TWO sheets, even though it gets cosiderably slower!"
1,Perfect junk,"This shredder managed to make it thru the warranty period before a total crash. Even with light usage, the shredder struggled -- but when it broke, you could see why -- this is garbage. The cutting blades are housed in a lightweight plastic housing that obvioiusly couldn't handle any load for more than a few months use."
3,"Good safety feature, rest of the product doesn't live up to it's billing","I gave this product three stars for it's safety feature. To me safety is number one and this product does it well. However, the rest of what this product promises it fails at miserably. My wife spent all of yesterday shredding papers one at a time (two if they were thin). The machine got bound up when you tried anything over two pieces of paper, and barely handled two light weight pieces of paper (even then with only marginal success). If this machine lived up to it's billing it would have been able to to handle much more, and my wife would have been able to accomplish in two hours what ended up taking all day. There are better products on the market; please don't waste your time and money on this product. Just trying to look out for FELLOW consumers (pun intended)."
1,It's always jammed!!!,This shredder performs terribly! It's supposed to have a 6 sheet capacity but it's really only 2 (or less). Put more than 2 sheets and it'll get jammed so that you have to set it in reverse and back about 5 times. And using only 1 sheet doesn't even prevent the jams. Sad to say it's a terrible product.
1,Garbage - DANGEROUS- No support,"I was given this as a gift and used it once for less than an hour then unplugged and stored it. Second time I had it plugged in, shredded about 5 minutes and went to the store and returned to find it running with no paper in it, very hot to the touch. Opened it to see if there was something stuck (though it stopped by itself before I left) and found the detedtion light had burned out. Contacted Fellowes and they claim this is not a defect.Fine - I'd love to have a machine just start running by itself when no one is around. My kids don't need their fingers for much and I DO have fire insurance."
3,broke with 6 sheets in an envelope,Worked great until my boyfriend inserted a letter with 6 sheets in a glassine envelope. It was recoverable after that. Replaced it with a cheapo from Target and that has lasted longer. Could be that my boyfriend not knows what he cannot put in the shredder
2,Poor design,"This shredder consists of a shredder unit which sits on top of a plastic bin. The shredded paper tends to fall in a heaped pile, meaning that when the shredder is approximately half full, shredded paper touches the rotating cutters, and wind back into the mechanism. If you empty the bin after shredding 20 sheets or so, it seems to work more reliably. This is a fuss.To empty the shredder, the top is lifted from the bin. It usually deposits pieces of paper on the floor.The shredder will strain to shred six sheets, and if the sheets happen to fold while feeding, it will jam. One or two sheets will normally shred OK.The shredder has several levels of safety features - turning it on requires flipping two switches on top, and the bin must be in place underneath - if you lift the shredder while it's on, it will stop. However, because the shredder jams so frequently, you may find that you will have to pull chunks of paper from between the rotating cutters, which doesn't seem a safe design."
2,Mediocre product... poor quality.,"I had this shredder for a little over a year, with occasional use (some bills, papers with SSN, etc). It was OK, with many safety features. It shredded fine for a while but it started making clicking noises and getting stuck (needed to reverse in order to 'set it loose'. Its supposed to do 6-8 sheets at a time but it had trouble with 3. Eventually it stopped working and after opening it up, I saw that many of the plastic components inside had cracked and fell into the shredding blades. I would not recommend this model!"
4,"Faithful, readable translation","Having read many translations, I prefer the RSV/CE on balance. The accuracy of translation is very good (perhaps only the NASB is better), AND it includes the Deutero-Canonical books. The footnotes are minimal, but I understand Dr. Scott Hahn is preparing an annotated edition. What we sadly lack in catholic circles is a SOLID CATHOLIC COMMENTARY on Scripture. If it were a choice of the RSV/CE to any other single translation or edition, I would definitely go with the RSV/CE. The 1966 Jerusalem and the ORIGINAL NAB would be my second and third choices. My theological background includes a Master's in the field, as well as some facility with Koine Greek."
3,Good for the price,"Good Bible for its price. Print is medium-small, as you might expect from a bible this size. Print runs too close to binding, so it's not the easiest to read. But, I like how it has no same-page commentary (some notes are in the back)."
1,"Good Translation, bad buy.","The Ignatius Bible RSV translation is a really good reference work, and has been recommended by many holy people. The problem is that Ignatius has trouble with quality control, when you receive your copy there will be production flaws, and their customer service won't help, the best thing to do is to pass on this item from this publisher. Ignatius has many quality first class items in their catalog. This is not one of them."
1,Print too small.,"The black ink against the glaring white pages really bothers my eyes. I'm 40 y/o and do not wear glasses nor need to. The print is not pleasing to my eyes and therefore will probably sit on the shelf. However, I love the size of the Bible, it is exactly what I was looking for to take with me in the car. Too bad :("
5,Great Bible,I had the same Bible soft cover and I wanted to have the hard cover so that it will last better. I love this Bible it is easy to read and find what I need to find in it. Plus it is small enough to take anywhere.
3,Fine Translation - Awful Presentation,"As an American Catholic in the 21st Century, I've learned - the hard way - that if the Church lacks anything, it's readable and reliable translations of the Holy Scriptures into English.The RSV-CE is, for the most part, a fine translation of the Bible (with few, but notable, exceptions, such as Isaiah 7:14), which is a good thing 'cause we're running out of options!But, like other reviewers, I'm saddened by the appearance of the translation on the page. Ultra-fine print, no breaks, no adequate footnotes for alternative reading, poor binding, no room for notes (if you underline a text, you cross out the line below it!), and an odd cover. I could go on and on.It would be nice to have an edition of this bible in a much more worthy format."
5,Elouquent and Easy to read,"The Ignatius Bible is the RSV translation.. This is the most poetic and eloquent translation of the Catholic Bible.Very minimal footnotes, doesn't crowd the page. The same translation that is used for Navarre Study Bibles,considerd to be the most accurate commentary for Catholics. It's compact enough to carry with you and quite durable. Mother Angelica of EWTN highly recommends this Bible, and, Dr Scott Hahn is writing individual studies for each book of the Bible based on this particular Bible."
3,Best Of The Worst,"While I agree with many others that this is probably the best ""Catholic"" Bible on the market when compared to the politically correct ""gender inclusive"" choices Catholics have IE the New Jerusalem Bible, The New American Bible and the New Revised Standard Version, it is not ideal. The ESV (English Standard Version) is the best choice for anyone, Catholic or Protestant. I realise that the ESV does not contain the Deutero-Canonical books that Protestants call the Apocrypha but so what? One can either purchase the Apocrypha separately or read it online. If enough Catholics buy the ESV and ask that the publisher of the ESV print a Catholic edition maybe they can be persuaded to do so. The RSV-CE has too many issues of liberal bias, especially in Old Testament prophecy of the Messiah for me to give it more than three stars."
3,Great Bible to read for an advanced reader,I donated this Bible to charity because it was hard for me to understand and read this Bible. Very organized and structured reading format
1,Time to evolve,Leviticus 25:24Exodus 21:20Numbers 31:17Psalms 137:9Deuteronomy 22:201 Corinthians 7:41 Corinthians 14:34Grow up.
4,great for boys who love transportation,"originally found this at library and grandson LOVED the trains, machines and airplanes dvd's...so much so, that i bought the collection for bday.very fun, informative..with cute music and kids. cant rate the dinosaur dvd, as we have not watched it yet...If your little one loves transporation, you cant go wrong w/ this one!"
2,Weak book in Collins' CSI series,I have become a fan a Collins' CSI books. This one is by far the weakest of the lot. The plot is extremely far-fetched and not written in a way to make it at all believable. The ending is both predictable and laughable.I was also disappointed in the character development. What has impressed me with Collins' other CSI books is the way he is able to further develop the characters that the television series has brought to life. He does nothing to add to any of the characters in this book and does little to show the personalities that the television series has developed.I do recommend reading Collins' other CSI books if you enjoy either of the CSI television shows (or even to read them if you are not a fan of the shows because the books are decent stand-alone reads). But this one can be missed. It does not even come close to living up the standards set in his other books.
4,Funniest one-acts ever,All three of theese plays work perfectly in the world of forensics for a humorous interp or Duo.
5,Great total body workout.,"I really enjoy this dvd. I have all of the equipment used, so that's a bonus already. But by varying the weights for your fitness level, you can get in a full-body strength training session. I think Patrick's personality really makes if fun, as well."
3,Not quiet what it might have been,"I wanted to like this CD but I have misgivings about it.Custer Larue has a pleasant light soprano voice, but of limited range.I don't think the recording quality here is up to the mark.The overall sound is feeble, which is a pity."
5,Great fun for kids who love trains,"I purchased this for my 3 year old who loves trains. The price was great and ship was quick. It comes with 4 discs and a carry case (even better). My son especially loves the I Love Toy Train dvds. This set includes I love Big Trains, parts 1,2 and 3 and I Love Toy Trains, The Best of Parts 1,2 and 3 along with 2 other discs. For the price you can't go wrong, considering one I Love Toy Trains DVD is usually 10.99."
5,Sharpe's Complete Collection,I prefer to order direct from Amason to insure quality and the ease to return a product (Sharpe's Complete Collection) that does not meet my expectation.
4,The Complete Sharpe,"I enjoyed all aspects of these films, production, acting etc. My only regret is they were not available in Blue Ray."
5,Sensational Acting,"What makes the series is the acting, primarily of Sean Bean, who gets less publicity than he deserves. Certainly, the transfer to DVD is of subpar quality, and these movies were made on a budget, but if you can get beyond that, you will find one of the best miniseries for TV.One really gets the feel of the real soldiers' life, the poor in England, and the English class system. This is an ""American"" theme- Sean Bean rises from the gutter to achieve military greatness. Of course, I loved the military aspects- tactics, strategies, battle scenes, espionage, etc.This is a great series- don't miss it."
5,sharpe's complete collection,"i was very happy with ""sharpe's compelte collection"" it was exactly as advertised in amazon,,it was listed as used,but in my opinion it was new,,,"
5,hot men - philippines tagalog dvd,"what a good start to this hot men series. reminds me of the early works of PLAYGIRL in american. no real nudity issues, but something they need to add to really make sales in USA go higher.all the men were very hansomely (pretty). second disc advertised in dvd jacket, looking forward to the next dvd."
5,Bosch Li-ion Impact driver,"I ordered this driver as a Christmas present and was pleasantly surprised by the power this thing has with just a 10.8V battery. One must become conscious of that torque when you are driving screws so that you don't strip them out when they stop.It is a nice alternative to my Dewalt 18V Nicad drill/driver that probably weighs twice as much.The kit came with a charger, two batteries, and a flashlight, that I didn't expect, all in a compact case that keeps it all together nicely.A good value for the money."
4,"Great tool for the size, but it is not going to be an 18v ID","I have Makita, Ridgid, Milwaukee, I drivers, and this is great for the size. The run time is not going to be like a larger battery tool, you buy this for the small size and power/weight ratio. It will easily sink 1/4"" lag screws on a full charge but I do not expect it to act like an 18v driver weighing 2-3 times as much. LiIon batteries will discharge in the cold so I think that maybe the problem for some. Store these type of batteries inside. There also may be a quality control problem with the batteries but I doubt it since the PS-10 &20 seem fine with the same batteries in the reviews, the impact driver do draw more power and it is a small battery pack. [I have both PS-10 & 20 tools too]The feature I would like, is a autolock on the shaft to allow final hand adjusting of the fastner but no impact I know of has that feature."
2,"great design, but","Bosch PS40-2 10.8V Impact DriverTerific design. It is light small and fits it a tool kit with ease. it's worklight is a nice touch. 30 minute charges wonderful. BUT. it will not work under 32 degrees F. annoying and unacceptable. the batteries wont work in the cold. also, it is not even close to the torque of my dewalt 18v drill. after failing to put 3 inch screws in all the way, I got my dewalt out and I forgot how much torque it had. i wont get another lithium powered drill."
4,"Useful little driver, a must for home owners!","Got this about a month ago, works well for a small lightweight driver. Drives sheetmetal and sheetrock screws perfectly well, drives nuts and bolts with a socket attachment reasonably well. Even drives lags, but not very quickly. I use it daily as an HVAC installer and find it to be quite handy, you never even notice it in your tool belt. Got my set at Home Depot and it came with the flashlight free, a useful addition - I swear the driver, light, two batteries and charger weight less than my Ridgid 18V impactor with single battery.I've even used this working on a few cars, removes lots of small fasteners quickly and easily. The built in LEDs are awesome.I carry it into my house each night to avoid letting it get cold. If you use cordless tools in the cold all day or MUST leave your stuff in the truck overnight, Ni-Cad batteries are where it's at."
1,Junk only for home use,Bought this impact couple months ago. At first looked nice. I liked this tool until i started doing professional job. After working all day long (disassembling paint booth) i noticed a smell that came from that impact. After 15 more minutes it died. Will never buy Bosch again. Bought Snap On 14.4 instead. Cannot compare them. Snap On takes any job and wants even more.
2,A big disappointment - too weak to be useful,"Although the design and construction of the PS40 is very good, mine did not produce much torque. Bosch claims 800 in-lbs of torque, but I doubt it. For example, I attached a 1/2"" socket and tried to remove a 5/16"" machine bolt. The PS40 couldn't do it - not enough torque. I then used a hand wrench to remove the bolt, and it only required a moderate amount of effort to do so. My old Milwaukee impact driver had no problem removing bolts of that size. As another test I held the socket with my hand as I pulled the trigger all the way back. I was easily able to prevent the socket from turning. And this was with a fully charged battery.It might be good for hobby use, but not in an industrial setting. I returned mine to Amazon for a refund."
2,Not worth the money,"I paid $199 for this driver at lowes, I broke my makita 14.4 2.6ah ( my bad, not the drivers) I was in the middle of building a deck. so I read the reviews and need something right away, This bosch PS40 driver does not have any guts at all You cannot and will not be able to do anything bigger than hang small doors, I just order the makita combo kit from amazon for the same money, Even at the new lower price. There are lot better choices out there"
2,Worthless,"Reading the other reviews it seems like you get either a weak one or a powerful one, I got a weak one. I really have no idea what you would use this thing for if they're all like this. The PS-20 pocket driver is awesome and while far from perfect the I-driver has it's uses but this thing is worthless."
2,whoa,"This is not a bad tool. It is an overpriced (though sexy) toy. It costs as much as their 14.4 impact (which is the best on the market in it's class) with nowhere near 1/2 the power or run time. It is lighter and slightly smaller, but disappointing in terms of performance. I would reconsider its merits if it were sold as a bare tool. As it is, I have the 3 drivers 6 batteries, and 3 chargers. Once in a while, it is convenient to have a small driver. The I-driver does what no other tool can do. I wish the PS20 had a regular keyless chuck. Having to carry all 3 bags around is ridiculous, and I wish I could get my money back on the PS40."
1,Bosch PS40-2 10.8V Impact Driver Hobby grade at best,"This tool does not perform up to the claims made by Bosch. The impact has no torque or speed. With a full charge the batteries only lasted for about 25 3"" screws in 2x4 soft pine. This would be a great tool for hobbyist, or if you needed to put some screws into styrofoam. Any one that makes a living with their tools will be very dissapointed in this impact driver."
2,Nice toy but not so nice for larger screws,"After much lamenting between the Bosch PS40 and the new Makita BTD142HW 18V 1.5 amp hour Li-ion Compact Impact Driver, I decided to give the Bosch a try first. I have other Bosch tools and the build quality is great. The tool is well balanced and the light works well. Unfortunately it just didn't have enough power or speed for 2 1/2"" deck screws into pressure treated compared to even my 12V standard Ni-Cd Ridgid. Way to slow once the impact action started. Perhaps I'm another victim of you either get a powerful one or a weak one. Took it back and bought the Makita today. The unit is only a fraction heavier but much more power and speed. It buries screws with ease and is very very fast. I like the chuck better too. For the homeowner or electrician I think the Bosch is a great tool; beyond that I'm not convinced."
5,Great little package,"This drill is impressive. Very surprised at how much power this thing has. As soon as you pick this up you can feel the quality in respect to: the plastic used on the body, grips, and balance of tool. Three LED Light system is very bright and a nice touch. The noise will get to you if using it in a repetitious manner. If driving long screws into say pressure treated lumber like building a deck you will go through the batteries fairly quickly. Other than that HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
4,Great small package,This product is all it claims to be and more.It has replaced my 12V and 14V drills. I use it to put together all my woodworking projects at this time. I also have the sister to this one and together they make an unbeatable pair.
1,Where is my product,The delivery date has come and passed 2 weeks now and STILL have not recieve my product. I WILL NEVER order from this seller again. Wasted money!!!
5,AMAZING!,"This is one of the most amazing products I have ever used! I have tried countless hair products with little luck. I have very curly, dry, frizzy hair, and this shampoo along with the conditioner is really wonderful. My hair is so soft, shiny and easy to untangle. Works great if I want to straighten or leave curly. I have been searching everywhere for this shampoo since I have so much trouble finding it locally. So glad I found it for a reasonable price!"
5,The last of Betty ??,"Betty hasn't released any new material since this devotional book (2001).I really enjoy it's a daily devotional, one page, quick, easy to read. I'm not a huge fan of the Bible but i do see it has much wisdom in it, Betty gives a Bible verse (passage) along with a daily thought and prayer for the day. It's a true uplifting gem to start (or end) each day with! I just wish Betty also used quotes from other spiritual books, say A Course in Miracles or the like, but in any even, I like this book!"
1,The regular Schaum's outline is much better,"This book is OK for learning what it covers. Also, considering Gussow's Schaum's Outline of Basic Electricity was last published in 1983, age might also have been a factor. However, the regular Schaum's on this subject just came out in December 2006, and it has been extensively updated and covers the material this book covers and much more, plus it is just as easy to follow as this book is. You get an extra 300 pages of material for an extra two dollars. If you need to learn the material in this Easy Outline, you are going to eventually need to know the material in Schaum's Outline of Basic Electricity, 2nd Edition, so you might as well just buy that one book."
4,Not too shabby. . .,"I got this album mainly based on the material that Determine has put out on other artist's songs, especially the shot he laid out with Sizzla on the classic Mi Lord, also some of the stuff he's done lately with people like Anthony B on Universal Joy. And speaking flatly, Determine can flow, he has a high level of skill at djaying, and when stepping in on other artists tracks, he holds his own absolutely, even with Kalonji, which is unherd of. The best tracks here are the ones where he just lets go and starts flowing, see Nuh Member Love (the albums best track), Nah Go Manage Di Damage, the title Track and the absolutely beautiful Head Corner Stone. Overall, I say absolutely pick this one up, its pretty hard to find, (it took me weeks to find it after I decided that I wanted it)but its worth it. No, Determine's not as good as Kalonji lyrically (nothing to be ashamed of) but he's right in that next group pf artists, so support him now, bigup Brickwall!"
4,Hell's Belles - A fantastic look at Denver's Wild History,This was a great look at Denver's early days and a view into what the Wild West would have been. A must read for history buffs!
4,Outdoor clock/thermometer,"This product is well worth its original price, and so we were pleased to be able to find it on sale. It is attractive, and the both the clock and the thermometer work fine."
2,Wake the dead,"A dull book for people who know nothing about the subject. The photos are barely accaptable, especially for the subject matter.Example: Joanne Woodward's extraordinary outfit (given her persona) for the Oscar she gave to Davis Lean for Robert Bolt's screenplay for Doctor Zhivago.Too much is missed."
4,Endosorb,"While this supplier was new to Amazon Market, they fulfilled their order in timely manner, I would use them again."
