2,No Go,"I returned this item because it came cracked but beyond that, it has a 'lip' on it that makes it difficult to work with. The return was easy enough."
1,Ever heard of a fact checker? An editor? An AWFUL book.,"The title of this book gets it half right. It is by no means a complete history, but it is indeed twisted...if twisting the facts counts. There are TONS of factual errors in this book, including the author's assertion that the Ramones, unable to pass up a good payday, continued to tour AFTER their last show in August 1996. Even if the author had no particular knowledge of his subject matter (which he apparently doesn't), couldn't he have used a fact checker? I'm sorry, but this is a really, really, really bad book."
4,good book,this is a good book for young punks everywhere. it tells the story of the greatest band ever. from their past to presant. its a good book if you want to know more about the punk past or just about their past.
4,Marky likes This Book,Marky likes the book that's enough reason to buy this bookP.S. The pictures are awsome GABBA GABBA HEY!!!!!!
4,High quality shirt,"I bought the 2xl and this is certainly big enough. Probably 3xl. I'm not complaining. When you're fat, too big is better than too small.The shirt is a very high quality. The print is of a lesser quality."
3,Very wordy and slow - for non-programmers only.,"I was wondering how the new crop of C# books would compare to the better of the first generation books (Troelsen, Liberty, Gunnerson, Archer) so I have been buying a few of them. I don't think the big four have much to worry about from this one. Although extremely clearly written I still have to say this book bored me to tears even though I eventually just started skimming it.What it is is an extremely careful introduction to programming and seems to be written to be a textbook on learning programming using C#. It therefore takes hundreds of pages to get anywhere, since it assumes you don't even know what a loop is! (There is almost nothing in this book that is .NET specific.)Still, if you need an introduction to programming using C# that starts with things like what is a loop and therefore doesn't get very far into .NET, you can't beat this book."
1,Again not a C# for Beginner,"If you are a novice like and never programmed before this book is NOT for you. All the reviews claims it is a beginner book for novice programmer. This is totally untrue. The athor starts with an advanced example of elevator and expect you to understand all the nuances of it with a few explanations. Trust me if you are a novice try either absolute beginner C# or C# 2005 for dummies , those are real books for beginners in programming & C#.This book is for programmer trust me. The author write a simple program ""hello"" explain with 2 pages. Then he goes and pass with an advanced example of Object oriented with his elevator program.The program is FAR to be as simple as you think. And it is poorly explaned.From the reviews I am reading either those guys are liars when they claim to be novices or they are genius to be able to understand this book as first book."
3,cute read,"This is a fun book to read through once or twice. It's really more of a puzzle book. Once you have figured out the CDC means, ""Sea the sea"" then you don't really need to read it again. Its a fun party book or something to pass on to your friends when you are done."
4,"Very clever, but not for all ages","This is a very clever book and it's quite fun reading. However, my 4 year old and I read together all the time and I bought this for him thinking it would be good for him too, but some of the picture themes are not interesting for a small child. This would be good for a 9-10 years +."
4,Still in sync with the world!,"CDC is a wonderfully charming book to read with all people from a beginning reader to a school senior to a grandfather. I have had the most riotous time reading this book with my senior Physics class, and I can promise that it helped their lateral thinking no end.I will not say anymore about the construct or the language of the book so I do not give away the surprise of it. I will, however, broadly hint that the title reads ""See the Sea?"""
5,Read the Movie!,"This book is a scene-for-scene rendition of the movie Panic in Year Zero. The few differences from the movie are minor--it actually makes a good trivia exercise to hunt for the differences! While the writing style is rather bland, I wasn't bothered by this as the book did what I wanted--provide a straightforward retelling of the movie in novel form."
5,The next best thing to being there yourself.,"Surfriders is an excellent blend of history, commentary, and contemporary writing about the sport and pastime of surfing. The photography is unbelievable and the prose engaging. The content covers everything from the beginnings of surfing with The Duke to the pressures of competition. There is an excellent section about Big Wave riding and even a look at surf culture in film. (What was the real deal with The Endless Summer?) This is a great book to experience, especially when the swell is off and there is no other surf in sight"
1,"Not a Geiger Counter, so why does it appear when searched?","Why does this device appear when you search Amazon for ""Geiger Counter?"" It is not even related to a geiger counter and does not detect alpha, gamma, or beta particles. It may be that the seller has embedded ""geiger counter"" in the index by ""accident"", if you get my drift. Read the specs carefully and make sure it does what you want it to do."
1,cheap,not useful. find another product to use for any radiation detection. might work for some household products. not very happy
4,This book was handy to have.,"I would not call this book a must have for traveling to Paris but it was a handy reference guide to find out what something was on a menu. It did save me from at least one mistake in ordering something I would not have wanted to eat! On the other hand, I felt that it was a little high-brow in that the least expensive restaurants were listed as below $25 and, call me cheap, but that is not necessarily budget dining for my family. We found that drinks were often the most expensive part of our meal and this book does not touch on that at all. I used Rick Steves' Paris 2003 book much more often than I used this one. Get both if you can afford it."
3,it is ok,"It is in the light side, on it is handeling and weight, I think Henckel is cutting corners now by farming it out some of its products to China"
3,"Decent knife, especially for the price.","Not the greatest Henckels ever, but definitely not the worst, either. It's a decent weight and gets the job done"
3,The Handle Leaves Something to be Desired,"Purchased as replacement for the SAME that had worn out from use. While the blade itself is of the same quality, there is something off about the handle material. it looks a bit beat up and even with handwashing, it isn't looking so good. However, the knife itself is of great quality and perfect if you like a smooth edge that you can sharpen."
4,Great value; decent courses.,"It's a nice boon that the Links 2003 Championship Courses (containing 20 courses) was available the same day that Links 2003 shipped, making a total of 26 courses betwixt the two titles. This add-on to Links 2003 is also a good value at only 20 dollars.About half of the courses are various selections from the Links LS libraries -updated with Links 2003 graphics and textures- and the other half are completely new add-ons. One should also take into account that you can convert ANY and ALL of your Links LS courses with the new Links 2003 course converter (on CD #3) which is an extreme bonus.I, personally don't like the new add-ons as much as the re-done Links LS courses. Generally-speaking they don't stand out and aren't very memorable, though several, such as the Robert Trent-designed Judge Course, are simply awesome: Very creative, challenging, and fun. Still, a decent selection of courses and an excellent value."
4,Links 2003 Championship courses,Great graphics and plenty of challenging courses.Fast loading and very little lag time.One of Links best games ever.The fun and challenge never stops.
2,It's a ripoff.,"Microsoft went out of their way to make sure that they make a profit from anyone who is stupid enough to buy this game.The video quality is poor unless you have a high end video card. Being somewhat of a golf game fanatic, having owned every links version back to Links 386, I had to have the latest version (Links2003) The advertising said that I could convert my old games. That is not true. I work in computer support and have been an avid recreational user for several years, but have not been able to find a site - microsoft or otherwise, that has a utilty to convert older links games to the required 2003 Format. I strongly recommend avoiding this latest offering from microsoft."
5,US Battleship Design,"Fascinating book covering the compromises involved in design and fabrication of armored ships. Well written, logically organized. Minor coverage of machinery and armament; only how these topics relate to the overall handling of design tradeoffs.I purchased the book to augment my marine technology library, and it fills that requirement well. I intend to purchase other books by the same author (Carrier, Cruiser design) also."
4,A fundamental reference,"This is the best single volume history (463 pages) of the development of US Battleships.Information is detailed and the text easy to follow. Foot or endnotes are not included, nor bibliography, just a four page `Notes on sources', but an index is provided, as well as a list of US battleships and a battleship data list.Photos are not abundant, but suffice to illustrate the text. However photos and some diagrams poor quality is this book worst flaw and what make for the 4 star rating. This is perhaps due to the poor quality paper this book was printed on. A work of such importance clearly deserves a much better edition."
1,stay away from it,"Took me a whole weekend the first time and the thing still didn't work. Every few lines in the documentation it asks you to consult your network administrator. I wonder how many homes have such a person?Then I sent an email to their support. Haven't heard from them yet. Not even an auto reply. This was several months ago.The second try, I got it to work. Turned out it's picky about the wires. It worked on my fourth wire. Unfortunately my phoneline wiring isn't good enough. I ended up hardwiring the two computers.And the speed isn't good either."
1,Linksys support really sucks!,"I have a Linksys Homelink network system that has now been unusable for months. When I upgraded to Windows ME, the only problem I had was with the Linksys card. Neither phone support or email support has been able to fix the problem. Email support rarely returns any messages, and if they do, all they say is they are working on the problem. I have four computers and a laptop and all were working decently on the network before upgrading to ME - not good, just decently - but what is so discouraging is the lack of support. I will NEVER buy another Linksys product!"
1,Erratic support; still no drivers,"I bought the LinkSys Phoneline 10M Network Card Kit in mid-November, fully expecting that nearly a month after the release of Windows XP, they would have drivers available. Boy, was I wrong. I called them up to ask when they'd be available and the friendly tech support rep informed me that the drivers would be ready around the 20th of November. On the 20th of November, they were nowhere to be found, so I called them up again. ""Oh, the development team is behind schedule. They'll be out by the end of the month."" So I waited until yesterday (the first day of the next month) to check the site for drivers. Guess what? There are STILL no XP drivers for the cards. I called them up again and they said: ""Oh, well it's the weekend, so I guess they're not putting them up until Monday."" There is too much going on in my life to have to bother playing phone tag right now. Three strikes, you're out, LinkSys."
2,Good Coffee Bad Construction,"I only like good coffee, I can't just drink anything and maybe drink a cup four times a week. I bought this model because it was the cheapest and I don't drink coffee at home that often but thought it would be nice for an occasional cup. Cheap is an accurate description. The flimsy design broke after just one use...and was completely useless after two three uses. And it leaked around the pod holder flooding the counter...big mess. Although the successful coffee in the cup was rather tasty, I would recommend another model."
4,this is a very good release.,"i really like the first 4 songs and the last 3 that are listed. heck it has hand claps and everything on 39 Forever. that is my favorite on this CD. i bought it on a whim while in Omaha and its really good. The sound is like a ""better vocals"" bright eyes. song writing is similar. and most of the songs seem to be focused on the evils of alcohol. Especially, lightweights drinking (5 stars), 39 forever (5 stars), don't lose your cool (4 stars) and others that i cannot remember."
3,Good for younger kids,"This is a very durable, easy-to-use slingshot. The foam balls go really far, but it doesn't have the best accuracy. One advantage is that younger kids can easily use it."
4,A Unique Textbook,"I've been using this text to teach a senior/graduate course on digital and analog filters. I've found the coverage and the organization to be excellent. Some of the derivations are unique and provide the student with a different point of view than he gets from standard signals and systems courses.I've found that combining digital and analog filters in one course provides the student with insights into filter techniques that he wouldn't get otherwise. Unfortunately, this is one of the few books that provide this coverage in one text. And it is certainly the best I've found.The only detriment is the large number of typographical errors. The instructor must take care to spot these and let the students know. I'd very much like to see a 2nd edition with these errors corrected."
3,Adorable and practical,"Very cute and my chihuahua doesn't mind lounging around in them when it's chilly in the house. My only problem is that the seams at both shoulders began to rip during the first week, but I think it may have been due to my dog trying to take it off himself when he got too warm. I am ordering a few more, regardless, because they are practical now in this cold winter weather to layer under his other clothes when we go out for walks."
2,Doggie Thermal Long Johns,"I just received this in the mail a couple of days ago, and I was very unhappy with the smallness of it. It would not cover my small dog at all. It is shorter than it appears in the back region. I will have to return it promptly. It would not stretch out at all to cover his back, and the feet were long in the front and small in the back."
4,Nice KVM for the price,"Switching between Windows XP and RedHat Linux and it works well and is easy via a buttong on the unit or by double 'ctrl' clicks. I also use a 17"" flat panet LCD monitor and the video quality is very good. The only thing I don't like about the unit is that the cables for the 2 pc's are on the sides of the unit. If it were a bit bigger and all the connectors on the rear... I would have rated 5 stars."
5,Much Better Than Expected,I read many reviews on this product. Concerns were raised over compatibility with Linux and mice with rollers. I am using this product with both and it works great. Its ease of use and low price make this a best buy.
3,Some good... some bad...,"I haven't been able to track down the reason for this problem, but for some reason my ctrl and shift keys now have about a two second delay (that is, to use either, you need to hold the key down for roughly two seconds... or it doesn't work).Checked their website, but nothing there.Other than that, the product is a great choice... I am very pleased with the video quality (was expecting much worse)."
3,Works But Does Not Switch w/o 5V Source,Bought this to switch VGA source between my PC and my Dreamcast videogame console. Found out afterwards that it needs the 5V power from the keyboard in order to switch.Works fine with PC's but be aware that this KVM only switches if it has the 5V input from the keyboard.Ended up buying a mechanical switch instead made by Inland. Total price for KVM box plus cables was about the same.
1,Not for IBM,As anothre post states this does NOT work with IBM ThinkPad. I have T20 with a docking station. It starts working up until you log-in then freezes. The only workaround is to swap the ports after the freeze--ridiculous! I'm very disappointed in Linksys.
1,Dell Laptop -- with NEC Flat LCD -- no go,The wavy lines on this great monitor were so bad -- that I could not stand to look at it. Reconnected the normal way -- looks great -- I guess the KVM Switch is not for me
4,Excellent product but Amazon sent me a broken piece,"I recently bought this KVM kit. It is really good and for this price, you can not get a better deal. The only lowdown is that even though the unit arrived in excellent packing condition and a new box well sealed, the switch to flip between two computers (heart of the system) does not work !! I was going to return it but there is an alternate way to use the [Ctrl] key twice on the keyboard. That was the only reason I did not return the product....But if the swtich in yours works, this is a very sweet deal. GET IT NOW."
2,Poor hotkeys make it unbearable.,"Sure the technical merits of good graphics, etc are a plus but do not garner the poorly thought out product 5 stars. After using KVM's for years I have never had the problems like I have had with this. Other manufacturers manage to use Ctrl keys for their hotkey functions without the problems that this box plagues you with.While this box may have garnered rave reviews from the folks who want to play Linux, etc., I have to say to use this on a primary production machine will eventually drive you nuts. If you are always using constant Ctrl or Shift operations to mass select items you will constantly find that your key press was not registered. In addition, sometimes your mouse will just freeze until you click a button again.Oh well, the same goes for all Linksys products... they are a bit cheaper than what you would normally pay *but* you get what you pay for. Suitable for home or dorm but not for an all day production machine."
2,Compatability Problems,If you are using an IBM computer with this KVM switch it will not work. The user manual suggests a work around which I tried but it did not work consistently. Trying to get tech support from Linksys was also difficult and anything beyond 1st level support was non-existent.
2,Quality control is needed for the Compact KVM kit,"Having read other Amazon reviews for the PS2KVMSK Linksys switch kit, I decided to take my chances and buy one. I hook up a Win2K thinkpad (via docking station) and a Unix machine, and things almost worked. The problem is not with the cables, but with the main module: it does not have a good internal connection for the mouse between the Console and the PC#2. (I did a lot of analysis to pinpoint this.)Since it is not worth my while to get the mouse problem fixed (shipping things back and forth is a real hassle), I will simply use two mouse."
5,My first KVM,It was on sale and I grabbed it and am very satisfied with what I got. I set it up and had it going in about ten minutes.
4,Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta Series,I have all of the books in this series. They are all very worth reading. Cornwell has developed an exciting and indepth character in Kay Scarpetta. If you read them by starting with the first book it is much easier to follow the story. Happy Reading.
1,Cornwell,I love Patricia Cornwell. I have all her books in hardback. I did not enjoy this cd at all due to the female orator. She showed no kind of emotion while reading. It was very flat and very boring. I certainly would never pick her to read a book of anyones. I actually threw it away and money doesn't grow on trees here.
1,A mighty mix up / mess,Id say the story might be good but up to now I havent been able to listen to it because.1 We all know Post Mortem was her first book but the way the stories have been put on this cd Body of eveidence is first.2 There is no Gap between to say this is now playing the next story.it says on the cd it starts on a certain number but Id say its not very well advised. I still havent found the beginning of the story and Ive tried 3 times.I think Im going to have to buy them again seperatly.Wasting money is not my favourite occupation.
4,wellreadbrotha,the first of the great scarpetta novels is very calculated and interesting mrs cornwell is a very safisticated and cunning author as is her characters.really enjoy her work
3,Not a happy customer,"Sure this t.v. is a great price, but there is a reason for that. We got it 9 months ago and today the light bulb blew up inside so I have no picture. Toshiba is sending another light bulb but we won't get it for another week. It has been making a strange buzzing sound since we got it, which I never understood. I wish I would have gone with a 1080, the picture quality is not that great and the buzzing is really annoying. On the plus side it is a very light t.v. (weight) and the hd channels provide a great picture."
1,Don't buy Toshiba DLP TV,The lamp on TV went out in 11 months and the second one went out in 13 months just before this christmas. Each LAMP costs me $250-$300. That means you may have to spend such a cost every year (if you made a wrong decision as I did to buy a Toshiba TV)! I only watch TV less than 3 hours/day. The manual's 6000-8000 hours time for the LAMP is compeletly mis-leading. Think second time when you buy a Toshiba TV and check the internet first to see real reviews. Don't trust Toshiba's manuals.
1,Lamp life is a little over a year,Same issue as everyone else. The lamp life is horrible. Do you think Toshiba did this to sell lamps at $250 a pop? Great way to make extra money. I'm sticking to Plasma and LCD from now on and more then likely wont go with a Toshiba.
3,NOT AS GREAT AS YOU WOULD THINK!,"I JUST PURCHASED THIS TV AND I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PICTURE QUALITY. IT IS ONLY SHARP ON HD CHANNELS. REGULAR CHANNEL LOOK GRAINY AND BLURRY AND WITH AN AVERAGE OF 20 HD CHANNELS IT IS NOT WORTH IT. I AM RETURNING IT FOR THE SAMSUNG 1080 DLP. ON A POSITIVE NOTE, IT IS VERY EASY TO OPERATE AND SET UP. IF YOU ARE GOING TO SPEND THIS MUCH MONEY SPEND A LITTLE MORE ON A BETTER TV. OUR SALESMAN TOLD US WE SHOULD GO WITH A SONY OR SAMSUNG WITH DLP TECHNOLOGY, WE SHOULD HAVE LISTENED."
2,Doesn't stay flat against seat,"As others have noted, the corners of this ""protector"" don't stay flat against the seat. But it's a cheap way to get at least some coverage and so far I've been able to get my 2.5 year old to understand not to put his feet anywhere but the plastic. We'll see what happens with winter wet feet."
3,Carly Simon's Midnight Farm,I thought if she could sing a great song then she could write a great kids book. I was wrong. The book is OK but it is not great. The artwork is nice but the narrative is weak. There is not much of a story line but it would be adequate for a small child. My five-year-old daughter was bored after the first reading.
2,"Dude I loved this knife, then it BROKE!","I used this knife almost daily for a year, when one day I dropped it on the floor and the blade broke in half!! What the heck???? It was super sharp though, with a LOT of use it never dulled. Still....it broke."
4,Excellent General Purpose Knife,I got this knife to go along with my other Henkel Eversharp knives. It works well for all purpose cutting and smaller jobs such as cutting oranges and lemons. So far mine has stayed sharp and the tip is still in tact. I would recommend this knife if you are looking for a durable all purpose knife for smaller jobs.
1,Tip broke 1st time I used it,"Usually I love Henkel, but this one I must say, the tip bent while in the sink the first time I washed it and when I tried to straighten it - it just plain broke off."
2,"Package says ""Not Recommended for Left-Handers""","I purchased this knife, and when it arrived, the package said, ""Not recommended for left-handers."" If Henckels chooses to design only for right-handed people, that's their right, but they should disclose it clearly. Second, [Amazon.com] should include such information in their editorial review. I'm left-handed, and I'll add this to my can opener and vegetable peeler as one-way kitchen gadgets."
1,Does not work with Zone Alarm,"The program itself is quite a disapointment. It's interface was so simplistic you couldn't do anything but ""allow"" or ""stop"" access.I spent an hour working on this until I found on the Nintendo WiFi site the following:Software Firewalls Identified as Being ""Incompatible"" with the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB ConnectorWe have identified the following software firewall(s) as being incompatible with the use of the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector. We suggest using another firewall product, if possible:Zone Alarm Internet Security SuiteImportant Note: In order to use the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector, Zone Alarm Internet Security Suit must be completely uninstalled from your computer. Simply disabling (turning off) this program will still not allow a successful connection.------How can this thing not work with the industry's most popular software firewall is beyond me.Unless I can find a 3rd party adapter that like Zone Alarm, it looks like I'm going to have to build a wireless network."
2,Not ideal for the Wii,"I am able to get online with the Wii using this device, but it is very touchy. My connection comes and goes seemingly at will. Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I would not recommend this product if you're using the Wii and not the DS. And yes I have disabled the firewall and my regular internet connection works beautifully so that is not the problem."
4,Reliable and easy to use,"The set-up for this item is very quick and simple, almost too easy. Then, just plug it in and Windows XP's Internet Connection Sharing does the rest. I would rate this five stars if the range were a little better - the Nintendo DS only receives a strong signal a few feet away or closer. Thankfully, it comes with a USB extension cord so you can place it closer to your DS even if your computer's USB port is in an out-of-the-way area.Side note: At the time I wrote this, the only ones available are for $80 or more(!!). That is ridiculous! Get one from [...] store instead for half the price, or wait until this is commercially available, assuming that ever happens."
1,HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"when i try to install it, i get to the part where i plug in the connector, then a message comes up saying ""internet connection sharing error"" and it makes me quit out of the instalation. does anyone know what to do???"
5,USB WIRELESS /WIFI DEVICE FOR WII/NENTENDO,Arrived ahead of schedule!! Works great with no installation problems. A super buy that works on the first try!
3,Hardware works fine but documentation is weak,"I'm using 3 of these cards on laptops in a home network, together with a desktop using Linksys's internal phoneline card. I finally have it all working and it works fine, but it was a struggle. The laptops are all different; configured to work with 3 different networks at work and 2 schools. Also 3 op systems: ME, 98, 95. Linksys's supplied documentation was simply not complete enough -- had to go to the Microsoft product support site for their help articles. Spent probably 25 hours altogether. Admittedly, I'm a first timer, but aren't most customers for this kind of product first timers?"
3,This homelink Phoneline is alright,"I thought that this was a great deal, the networking ability allowed for easy sharing of files and documents to the other computers in my house. I would probably buy this network card again."
5,Excellent,"I am very happy w/ this purchase. The product works very well, and quality is excellent. Highly recomment this item."
4,Psycho-pulp Criminal Mania!,"This is one of those great little crime/pulp books that mix a lot of absurdity and humor with blasts of extreme violence and very disturbing events. The characters are perfectly executed (in a couple cases quite literally) and that makes the reading all the more fun. The final act stretched things just a liiiittle too far for me, but that didn't take away from what was a fast and enjoyable read. Fans of Tarantino and Coen Brothers films will dig this; cozy readers beware!"
2,disappointed,"After reading the author's ""Choke on your lies"" which was awesome, I figured how could I go wrong with anything else by Mr. Smith? Well, I am still not done with this one because frankly, I only read it in between other books. The plot is too simple and uninteresting. Mr. Smith, I'm begging you , please write a follow up to ""Choke on Your Lies"". Octavia Vanderplatt is fabulous! Choke on your Lies would also make an entertaining movie."
1,Misogynistic,"Well,I'm a big fan of pulp fiction but this one is fishwrap only. A protagonist with no arms and legs who gets done to in every possible way by men, and is supposed to have manipulative powers? You have got to be kidding. I may be male but I have utmost respect for women as equals in the work place, home, and world, and this portrayal made me sick. I've read some of Smith's other work on the Web: dead women wrapped in shower curtains and so on, and I think he's a woman-hater with nothing much to do but fantasize about it. Somebody sent this to me to read, and I got through it, but I won't bother to pass it on, even to the library bargain bin. The book is embarrasing, poorly written, and sadistically conceived."
4,Cult Item,"I haven't heard the CD release of this record, but I still have the LP which I bought when it first came out. I was a huge Marty Balin fan and he'd gone dark for a couple of years -- which back then, seemed like forever. A nice, loose, funky album with fine singing."
3,The cutter is useless,"This product is fine as far as pliers go. If you're looking for a wire cutter, look elsewhere. I couldn't even cut through craft wire with these."
1,Warning: Item description and photo are incorrect,"The description and photo are for Stanley MaxSteel pliers. However, when I ordered these I received Stanley FatMax pliers (Stanley's lower-market brand). They are clearly different from the pliers shown in the picture. It looks like a FatMax grip has been stuck on a MaxSteel frame, because the grip does not extend all the way up the handles - there is still unpolished steel visible. I told Amazon about the mistake and they sent me a replacement: the same, incorrect pliers again - so this wasn't just a one-off mistake. I recommend against buying these pliers until Amazon corrects the description so that you know what you are getting (the FatMax pliers are decent, they just aren't what was advertised)."
5,Queen's Gambit,The book is really fun. This group of high school misfits goes on a couple exciting adventures. To find out the real thief of the new multimillion dollar computer chip. You will have to find out if they survive their life-threating explorations. This book is a five star read.
5,TiVo Series 2 Users-- Must have this!,"After trying 3 usb-ethernet network adapters to get my TiVo Series 2 to work on my home network, I came across this one. Unlike the others (which TiVo lists on their website as working) this one actually worked and my TiVo recognized it immediately. Great buy, study piece of hardware (better than the other Linksys network adapters). I'd reccomend buying this for anyone who has a Series 2 TiVo."
1,I've had nothing but trouble with mine,"This adapter has caused nothing but trouble - and Linksys support is non-existent. We bought this and have been unable to get it working well on 4 different computers, (Vaio laptop, Toshiba laptop and 2 different e-machines). Although sometimes we were able to sustain a connection, the driver repeatedly disapeared and we could not boot with the adaptor connected. All the machines were running Windows 98. Linksys only response to repeated e-mails on the subject and one phone call was to tell us to download the driver again.BUYER BEWARE -- this product is not worth the money."
5,Mighty Little Adapter,"I bought one of these things for an underpowered internet appliance - With a Cyrix 200MHz MediaGX! :) I'm happy to report that it works very well, even on this snail. I'm able to go on the net, and transfer files back-and-forth to my other computer without a problem.I've also used it to transfer big files between a friends computer and mine. Very handy!"
1,Linksys support totally stinks!,"I have a Linksys Homelink network system that has now been unusable for months. When I upgraded to Windows ME, the only problem I had was with the Linksys card. Neither phone support or email support has been able to fix the problem. Email support rarely returns any messages, and if they do, all they say is they are working on the problem. I have four computers and a laptop and all were working decently on the network before upgrading to ME - not good, just decently - but what is so discouraging is the lack of support. I will NEVER buy another Linksys product!"
1,"Just a bad, 'wobbly' knife","Very, very disappointed. The blade is too thin, so the knife is not balanced at all. Be careful, you can hurt your self pretty badly.I am experienced with cooking and normally I do not write reviews or opinions, but here I just HAD TO SPEAK OUT!!Probably the manufacturer believes that the buyers won't bother themselves for 8 bucks to return it."
3,Good but not the best Henckels,"This Henckels is made in China with German steel. Not in the same league as my Henckels made entirely in Germany but it does the job. Good for everyday multiple tasks. Stays sharpened for a long time and is easy to sharpen again when it becomes dull. Handle a bit short if you have a big hand. I bought it to replace a very old (30 years) Henckels of the same type. The older one had a more flexible blade and a longer handle. It is hard to compare, but I would say that they used to make better cheap knifes. Today the top ones near perfection but this Chinese versions need some improvement."
2,Not worth it,I bought this knife based on the company name. Bad idea. Although JA Henckels usually makes great knives this is not one of them. The biggest issue is that knife is VERY flimsly. You could hurt yourself. My IKEA knife is better than this. I threw this knife away.
4,Great knife for the money!,I have a Henckels knife myself and bought this one for my mom for Christmas. Great for any kitchen and well worth the money. Make sure you hand wash this knife to make it last.
2,Too much 'Lord' in Owen's book....,"I picked up this book hoping (but not really expecting) to understand more about the Yugoslavian conflicts. Over the past years, I have truely tired of the media 'soundbites' that seem so incomplete and confusing.As soon as I started reading David Owen's book, I was struck by his arrogant attitude, complete with international 'name-dropping' and high-brow dinner parties. Although it was an interesting glimpse into international power circles, I wish that Lord Owens would have spent more separating his opinions from the facts."
5,amazing beautiful lamp!,"I have always wanted a tiffany ""fruit"" lamp for my kitchen. Sadly tho, for 30+ years my kitchen wasn't suited for such. Finally!, I have one!! And I must say, I leave it on for longer than necessary just to look at it and smile! Great product at a very affordable price!! I am a happy satisfied customer!!! Catherine"
2,Expired Items,"First let me say that this is a fairly comprehensive first aid kit. My problem with it is a simple one. I purchased this product at the end on Nov.2010 and the items in it have an expiration date of Jan 2011, two months left. I would return the purchase but it is more trouble then it is worth. Most of the items in it do not have expiration dates, ie: Bandages and band aids so I have opted to just replace the items that need it at my local drug store. I have to say with all the purchases I have made from Amazon over the years, this is my first major disappointment. Needless to say, while the price is better then I have seen it from other suppliers and I am sure Amazon would gladly replace it, I do not recommend that you purchase it here."
5,Beautiful and fascinating book.,"This is a very beautiful and fascinating book. It has wonderful photographs of sacred sites in Canada and the United States, along with Native American legends about the sites. I highly recommend this book."
5,Great quilt for leaving up year-round,"I made companion quilts for my sister, my daughter, and me. We're having so much fun adding new little quilts for the centers each month! I love that I can leave the basic quilt up all year but totally change the look by changing out the center. I made sure I used fabrics in the borders that would go with quilts from all seasons. One of my favorite quilts I've ever made!"
3,It's fine for my occasional use,"You can immediately tell the difference in construction between this knife and its German cousins..this one is madein Thailand. It is fine for me, though, and I am satisfied with it."
5,Great knife,This knife is the best I've ever had. Does the job fantastically on various foods & not just bread. I'm thinking on ordering another because I just love it.
5,Does the Job,It's a knife. Hand feel is good and the size works well for cutting crusty breads with a soft center. Balance is good.
5,"Great knife, great price","I had my doubts when I paid only [price] for a Henckels knife that it would actually be a decent piece of cutlery. No need to worry! This is a great knife. It is sturdy, it keeps its edge, and it looks great with my other Henckels knives. This is by far the best bread knife I've ever used. I'm very pleased with the quality, and I'm glad I took a chance on ordering it."
4,good knife at a great price,"The Henckels Int. Fine Edge Pro 8-inch bread knife is made in China, and the quality certainly reflect that. But, luckily, so does the price. I'm very happy with how it slices. The only reason I didn't give it a 5star is because when I received it, I could tell that the points of the serrated edges are not cleanly sharpened. There are some slightly benttips and extra steel. But I smoothed it out by placing the flat side down on a flat sharpening stone and slide it back and forth a few times. I definitely would not pay the original price for this, but at [the price], it's a great deal!"
3,Heavy bread knife,It looks like a lower quality product from J.A. Henckels. The knife is heavier and thicker than I expected. Not much to say about this product.
4,Exellent for the price,"I am happy with this knife as it has worked good to excellently on all types of bread / cake products for last 3 months. It could be a bit sharper and is only ""good"" on very crusty bread, but still slices with only slight deformation. If you use point to create a ""starting place"" it works well enough though and good value for price."
5,Very nice knife,This knife has had consistent performance when cutting breads and cakes. I've had the knife for almost a year and it cuts as well now as it did when I bought it. I've also bought one for my mother-in-law and she is in love with this knife as well. It's definitely been money well spent.
2,Three strikes and it was gone,"This knife gave a performance roughly equal to what I paid for it. Bread knives aren't really precision cutting tools, they basically need to be able to get a good grip on a hard surface and not make too many crumbs. On both these counts this knife was not successful. The blade is rather thick and as a result converts a lot of whatever it cuts to crumbs. More importantly, the serrations did not stay sharp and had a tendency to slip. After three people, myself included, got cut as a result of the knife slipping on hard bread or a bagel that was the end. I replaced the knife with a Suisin bread knife, which, while more expensive and a little hard to find, is far better as a bread knife."
3,Needs elbow grease,"Henkels makes great knives in their top end lines -4+5 stars, however they are not razor sharp out of the box and if they are they will not be for long.They simply need to be sharpened at least 3 times more often than Wustof-Trident or Global. If you are good at sharpening this is a great knive."
2,You get what you pay for...,"It is safe to say that I was ecstatic when I saw a Henckel serrated knife for under $20. I figured that it would not be a stellar blade, but that given the name stamped on it that it would be ""good."" Well I can say as a connoisseur of cooking and fine cutlery that this knife is cheap! The edge on it brand new was poor. It should be cutting through bread like butter, but I actually need to use significant pressure when I cut through a baguette...which is not good. I will attempt to take it to get sharpened, but I am not going to get my hopes up."
1,Soft steel is easily damaged,"The sharp edge is so soft it was damaged by the first hard-crust bread I used it on. A small pressure by my fingernail easily deforms the edge. The edge is not so thin that I would expect this, base on other knives I own including those by Henckel (German made), Gerber, Victorinox, Cold steel, Chicago Cutlery, and even a very-thin-edged chinese vegetable knife."
4,simple and easy to use....worked as advertised.,"small, light, and portable. packed a lot of functionalities into one device.can get it @ Sam's Club for $30!!fan can be pretty loud while the charger is working."
1,Power on Board Battery Chargers are junk,"The idea behind the charger is brilliant, but the quality of the components is poor.The cooling fans fail rapidly; often within a month. Also the display is kind of freaky. It is essentially impossible to get one repaired. The original company got bought out by a fly-by-night monster corporation that just doesn't care."
2,doesn't work,"terrible sling shot, only works with the ball, and it is extremly hard for a little kid to use...sorry"
5,Amazing for the price!!,"I've just begun to use the KMF line of products as recommended by a friend. All I can say is WOW!! This is an amazing product that actually does what it say's..I've used for a week now and can see noticable results already and have had people comment on how much better my skin looks. I actually took a before and after picture to monitor the results and my skin looks more nourished and moisturized. This product has reduced those fine lines and makes my skin look and feel more healthy and much younger. A must have for the price and results! Another HUGE plus is that it contains only natural ingrediants, not tested on animals & does not contain any chemicals or animal products!!"
1,I never received the book!,I am sure I will love the book if I ever receive it! I wascharged but never received it!
4,Parenting a Child with Asperger Syndrome: 200 Tips and Strategies,This is a good guide for assisting a parent with a child that has been diagnosed as Autistic or Asperger Syndrome. Currently one in every 150 children in North America are diagnosed with this condition. Parents need all the help that can get to deal with it and this book has some of those answers. My autistic angel is a joy to have as part of my life but he does need to be handled differently than his siblings. This book helps.
3,Not my favorite,"Our 4-year-old son was recently diagnosed with Asperger's and I've been looking for books to help us understand and help him with certain aspects. I will keep this one around for future reference as it is set up prefect for quick reference. I just didn't care for it much. I wish I could explain why. Maybe I just couldn't connect to the author.It may be more useful as we come upon certain problems but it didn't help us understand much at this point. I would probably not recommend this book but would rather recommend ""Ten Things Every Child With Autism Wishes You Knew"" by Ellen Notbohm. That one has been much more helpful in understanding how he might feel. It doesn't necessarily give answers on how to handle things, but it gives us insight into his mind."
5,Absolutely the best!,"I have perpetually dry skin all winter long. This winter it turned into a form of eczema that is incredibly difficult to get rid of. I'm here to tell you, this is by far THE BEST lotion for dry itchy winter chapped skin!! As long as I use it daily, my eczema disappears. Much better than the prescription lotion that I got from my dermatologist. Give this one a try!"
5,Great product for the price,"This is a great knife. I had one for 5 years before the tip broke when my boyfriend used it to pry apart two frozen hamburger patties (which was ""user error"" in my mind). It stays sharp and was inexpensive enough that I don't fret about putting it in the dishwasher, which I would never do with higher quality, more expensive Henkles."
1,I can't believe how expensive this xylophone is!?,"The product is not the same as represented in the image. They must've negotiated with a new manufacturer. The play sticks are plexiglass rods with a hard-plastic round end, and the wood is of poor quality.Within 5 minutes from opening the package, and not even having assembled the unit fully, my son had already broken one of the balls of the sticks while hitting some of the tubes. Granted, he was hitting it brusquely; yet, this is a 2 year old kid, using what I figured was a kid's toy.This item is way overpriced! Now that I realized what I got myself into, I looked around for a kid's xylophone on the site, and lo and behold, most are under $20, are plastic and metal, and look quite sturdy for a 2 year old to bang on.What's surprising is that this is an Imaginarium toy. It's the first time EVER that I am dissapointed with an Imaginarium product.I will be returning this one."
1,Early Indy,"It's 1922, Indy has just graduated from college and is going for his doctorate in ancient languages. However, he is lured away from his studies by his beautiful professor to look into what an earthquake has exposed in Delphi. His adventure and the professor give him cause to re-examine his career and possibly take up archeology instead of languages. The book is slow paced, lacks the real adventure of Indiana Jones, but is strong enough to stand up for a younger-just-starting-out Indy story. My biggest gripe is the dialogue just doesn't flow and, while not overwhelming, the use of swear words (emphasize that it really is minimal and Indy never really did curse but he uses the caca expletive repeatedly in this). None-the-less, as the first in the novel series, it could have been better but is still acceptable."
2,Good but not Great.,If you didn't need this book as a setup for the next one then I would say skip it. The next book is better so if you want to read the whole series then I'm afraid you need to choke this one down in order to get to the next one which will not disappoint.
4,"Young, Naive, and Simply Indy","Don't be put off by the cover art as I almost was. Indy is still the tough hombre we all have grown to love, not someone who looks confused and constipated as the art work seems to show. First meet Indy fresh from college. We see how he came to love and relish the field of archeology. The character of Indiana Jones grows up before our eyes. Along the way there is non stop heart pounding action. Once started it was hard to put down. It made me want to read all of the Indy books."
3,Somewhat boring,"I'm sorry.If I'd read this Indy book first,I might not have read the rest of the series.In my opinion,there is to much lovey-dovey stuff and bad language in this book.There is a lot of action,though.I recommend reading this book while waiting for your dentist appiontment(and only taking this book to read)so you'll finish it(I did so too)"
4,"Great beginning and fast-moving end, great book","This book started off great with the two men, and not knowing what they are doing. I couldn't put it down. I just love Rob's books!"
3,"Not really Rockabilly, folks","I love Eddie Cochran, he's the best, but the first dozen or so tracks in this two-fer are not rock at all. He was a canny studio cat, trying to craft a popular album, and the results are these corny pop tunes that have not aged well. Sittin' In The Balcony may be the only song I can stand among these. If you like '50s cheese be my guest, but most of his crazy rockers are to be found elsewhere. The phony ""humbly thanks his fans"" note on the back is also hilarious, but still not enough reason to buy."
4,"Live Well, Die Holy","This book gave me a lot of wonderful information about how to live a Christian, God-centered life. While some of St. Robert's ideas seemed a little outdated in our post-Vatican II era, the overall theme of the book was very helpful."
5,Fast efficient service-Granddaughter loved it.,"When I purchased this mute, I was given an approximate date of delivery. This was very important to me as it was a birthday present. Well, it came in a lot earlier than expected and my granddaughter had it in time for her birthday. Thank you so much for the swift delivery."
5,Long Quiet Highway is a spiritual stroll,"Natalie Goldberg's Writing Down the Bones became a handbook fortaking another look at writing about our own lives. Just abouteveryone I knew had a copy. Now she's written about her own life: from her profound sleep of a suburban childhood, thru the first time she heard the rain, to her years as a student of Zen Buddhism. With moments of illumination, long discipline of daily practice, hilarious errors & stumbling over the grief resistance to change brings, Natalie Goldberg, wanders along the highway of her life, so far. A very satisfying read..."
5,Restful and illuminating,"Using techniques taught in Writing Down the Bones, Goldberg describes her discovery of writing as a Zen practice. Vivid descriptions of her various homes and her emotions through the events of her life, including the death of her Zen teacher - Katagiri Roshi."
4,very honest memoir,"I don't know much about Zen, but this was an honest memoir, and I sympathized much with Ms. Goldberg. I just read a review that accuses her of being self-centered. First of all, this is a memoir. Secondly, the author is not perfect and it is clear she doesn't see herself as such. This is why her honesty comes through.It is not the most dynamic memoir I have ever read, but I very much enjoyed it. Her relationship with Katagari Roshi was very touching."
1,Don't waste your time,"Talk about disappointing! Goldberg is supposedly an up-and-coming writer, and after hearing about her for a while I decided to check out Long Quiet Highway.In fiction, it's usually a good idea to make your main character an enjoyable one. In non-fiction, you may not like the main character, but she should at least have some redeeming qualities. Goldberg is not only difficult to like or sympathsize with, she is also boring. I forced myself to finish reading, but the only thing that I could remember afterwards was the author complaining about how difficult it was to go to school because all of the other kids where eating peanut butter and jelly sandwhiches while she was forced to eat tuna. Oh, the pain of it all!If you have a strong interest in Zen, this book might hold some value for you. But there better Zen books out there."
1,Beware Not What You Think,This product has some serious limitations. First there are no cables shipped with the product. The cables required are not standard PS-2 extention cables. It requires PS-2 cables with Male connectors on each end. Since there are no cables you need to buy another $50 worth of cables to use it. Next It does not support AT keyboards. It also does not support PS-2 to AT adaptors on the cable. So unless you have PS-2 ports on the PC's you are connecting this device will not work.
5,A 5th Avenue Christmas,I enjoyed this book!! There are other books that go with it about her sister's and I read all of them also. I think it was 5 total. They are a real enjoyable read.
2,Disappointing!,"I picked this book up because of the cover, what a mistake. I find I haven't very often given bad reviews, but I found it hard to finish this book. I have other books of hers and hope I am able to enjoy them more than this book."
3,Looks very attractive but does not move the air at all,I was so excited to get the fans installed. Once installed it looks very nice but it does not move the air at all. You can put a feather right underneath it and it would stay in place (no kidding). This is really meant for decoration only.
3,Good content but lacks enough energy for the modern child,"While the content on this tape is accurate and well presented, the modern child accustomed to having their senses bombarded with audio and visual data will no doubt find it boring. The narrator does a very good job in demonstrating the fundamentals of subtraction on a number line and the abstraction of subtraction as the manipulation of symbols where you are subtracting smaller numbers from larger numbers. In the last section, the steps of subtraction where you must alter the column to the left and ""borrow"" or ""regroup"" are explained.All of this is done using manipulatives, or moving on a number line or drawn on a chalkboard while the female narrator (Dr. Sarah Allison) speaks on in a very soft and monotonic tone. This is fine for brief lessons, but for longer sessions, such for an entire class period, the students will enter into a state of boredom."
3,Good book if your interested in history.,"I was disappointed with this book. Having just bought a tandem bike, my wife and I thought we'd spend some time riding the towpath along the Erie canal in Western NY. What this book lacks is directions on how to get where you're going. There is very little information on access points or parking areas.It is a nice historical reference to take along, or read before you go, which is why I gave it 3 stars. But, if you're not sure how to get there, or are wondering about where you may leave your car while you're riding, another book may be necessary."
3,3rd time not neccessarily a charm,"I agree with everyone who have shared their comments thus far. But if you're a hard core Crash Vegas fan like myself, and have appreciated the 2 albums before ""Aurora"" (Red Earth & Stone) it's worth giving this album a listen. Especially for the Neil Young cover of Pochahontas.I don't know what happend to them and I wish they'd stuck around to do another CD like the first 2, but I guess it's all Canadian rock history now."
5,A nail-biter,"This book reprints Voice Recorder Transcripts (when available) and NTSB findings (in terse, direct phrases) for SELECTED airline incidents, mostly from 1960 to the Columbia breakup in 2003. He generally strives not to be melodramatic in his recreations, which is a definite plus. The only thing I find annoying is his absolute refusal to reprint profanities and vulgarities spoken by the pilots in their final moments (he constantly equivocates with (""Expletive""), or my favorite (""Name of The Son Of The Deity"")). But you can usually figure out what they're saying, or choose your own euphemisms.A good book."
3,More good than bad,"I am an avid reader of air disaster books, don't ask me why. This book has a few problems with style and syntax. It could do with a good copy-editing for readability. As it is I gave it 3 stars; I'd love to read a future edition which has been competently edited and formatted for readability."
2,nothing new,"Although conprehensive, there is nothing new or original here. It seems everything is either a direct reprint of published reports, or a slight rearanging of public stuff. No imagination, no editorial originalality. Just read ntsb reports."
4,great watch,I have worn this watch since christmas and just love it.It gains about 5 seconds per day but I can live with thatas my other Tag watch keeps good time but costs a smallfortune to replace battery.I wanted an elegant lookingswiss made watch and this fits the bill
3,Want my change back!,There is only one scene in this movie that is worth watching and is the exact reason I bought it......the liquor store! The rest of the movie is terrible but again that's not why I got it.
1,what a waste,"I have seen a lot of B movies, but this one takes the cake! I don't mind cursing in a movie but this was bad. The plot was a cute plot but never went anywhere. I gave 2.00 usd for the movie and wasted the money since i didn't add it to my movie collection. I filed it where it belonged in the trash!"
4,Low budget and brown but not bad..,"It's interesting that with the advent of video cameras getting cheaper that independent films get made en masse. With that within reguard this one isn't bad. The lighting is good and stands out...it should it's sunlight. It was pretty funny and chances are I'm going to see it with the directors commentary...the drug scene I thought was a bit too long but beyond that it was good.BTW you can see the infamous clip if you go to google and type ""Where's my change *itch"""
1,Please don't waste your time or money,"This movie doesn't even rate one star. It rates a MINUS THOUSAND. I had medium expectations realizing this was a low budget film, and have respect for all filmmakers. However, the only interesting thing in the entire movie was the ""kid"". Other than that, the story line was not believable, the film quality was very bad and the dialogue was redundant. MF this, MF that, MF the other, just on and on and on and on. I almost went nuts watching it. Sorry, but this was the WORST movie I have EVER seen. Want to see a really good movie, try any movie with Ice Cube and Mike Epps, Friday After Next and All About the Benjamins. Great fun watching those. Sorry, Amazon, but not only would I not pay ... to buy this, I would not pay one cent, no offense."
3,This film is below low budget!,"the seller came through and the movie arrived just as it was describe! GREAT JOB SELLER!!! I happened to see a clip of this movie floating around on youtube and it was pretty funny. so I decided to go ahead and buy it. When I finally recieved it and put it in the dvd player, i was instantly shocked at how it was filmed. The film looks as if it was video taped with a handycam and edited on windows movie maker! and that may be giving it too much credit! The scenes of the movie that i saw on youtube were infact the only funny parts of the movie. the rest was filled with ignorant wit and poor acting! I give this movie 6 thumbs down!"
1,Simply Terrible!,This has to be one of the worse movies of all times. The only thing funny was the little boy and that's sad. I did not expect this movie to look like it was shot with a personal camcorder either....sad sad sad!
3,Intro to Women's Studies,"This book was a good introduction to Women's Studies, especially for those who have never taken a class or major in Women's Studies. The format of the book made it easy to understand concepts introduced in the essays. They even have a key terms section, which I found VERY helpful. Some of the essays can be dense, like the one going over intersectionality. Overall, I found this book very pleasant to read."
1,"Warning, Blades will BREAK!","I'm replacing these for a roommate because 3 of her original Eversharp Pro steak knives have literally broken straight through during use. All of her set are now missing tips because of flimsy cheap design. But more so, three of them cracked straight through about 1"" up from the handle. Cheap and not worth the money. You are better off saving up for a decent set of forged blades. Serrated edge also tears rather then cuts through food. Completely ruins prefectly good meat. Great for slicing a tomato and thats about it..."
2,Disappointed Purchaser,"I will probable not be keeping these knives. They are large and heavy, not a tableware set at all. Maybe OK for BBQ setting since they remind me of a hunting knife. I do not feel the picture adequately identifies just how big these knives are."
1,Never again,These knives are terrible! The eversharp edge is finely serrated and tears the steak leaving pieces of meat hanging on the edges. It rips the food instead of cutting it. I thought the Henckels name would be better than this. Don't waste your money!
4,good purchase,"great knives, sharp and work wonderful...cut right through the meat with no problem...does the job and the handles are the right thickness."
3,"A good work, but not an Atlas","Over all I would recommend this book. However, it is not by any means a exhaustive effort. Facial drawings are charcoal and, in my opinion, lack the necessary detail. The author only skimmed over one extremely important aspect of human nature--sexual interest and attraction. Still, there is enough in this book to make me feel that it was worth the price."
3,Outdated book,"The images are a few quick sketches, and not well organized. I have appreciated a little gallery of 16 clay models. I would suggest you a better book by Gairy Faigin."
5,crate,Great shipping fast delivery Product has little turtle in it that dogs tried to get out though
4,Compelling,"I picked ""THE MYSTERY ROAST"" off the library shelf on a whim... I enjoy coffee, so the cover & title intrigued me. The 'blurbs"" intrigued me even more, so down I sat to read. Hours later, at 1am, I could NOT put it down! The writing is so engaging - I especially love the historic 'flashbacks' engendered by the Goddess, and almost wish that Gadol had spent more time on fleshing those out. I am looking forward to reading some of Gadol's other work, and am so tempted to wander around the old Meat District in the west village during my next visit to NYC to find the ""Mystery Roast Cafe""."
3,Review of The Mystery Roast,"Fairly well written with decent dialogue. I was disappointed that more wasn't written to fill the reader in on characters' backstories. I had expected to read of more prominent gay characters, similar to those in 'Silver Lake', but such were rather minor in the story's development."
5,Sweating Never Felt So Good,"The video was a pleasant surprise and really holds up well in comparison to some of the other aerobic DVD's I've purchased over the last year. It's easy, energetic, and wonderfully crafted for beginning fitness enthusiasts like myself. Giselle really delivers here. If you enjoyed her in Cardio Salsa, you'll really love her in this DVD. She has a charisma that makes her unique in the way she carries a vibe as a fitness host. You can't help but want to dance and sweating never felt so good. This DVD is a definite gem!"
5,Great books for people of all religions,I was so happy to see how beautifully the author explained Islam. She answered so many questions that are commonly asked or misunderstood. I also loved the love story. This was a good read from the beginning to the end. I loved it!
2,decent attempt,"I'm very happy at the success this book has had amongst both the Muslim and Non-Muslim community. I agree with the overall message, and how it can relate to personal struggles that each one of us may have had. However, there were certain things that couldn't help but annoy me. On almost every page there is a character ""forcing laughter"", I felt like that phrase was overused quite a bit. She was a bit over-descriptive when it came to the scenery, wardrobe, and features of random characters. Once I got past my personal literary pet peeves, it is actually quite good, but could be better. Definitely an improvement from the first book, I'm sure the third time will be the charm.Overall: worth the read if you're not easily annoyed."
2,Semi-excruciating,"I give this book two stars instead of one only because I'm assuming there is a significant amount of fact--dry fact. If this book is to be used as a reference for research it would best be utilized in combination with other books dealing with the same subject. It shouldn't be relied upon by itself.In addition to the Jew-bashing noted by another reviewer, I found the book to be boring. Although I purchased it over a year ago, I have been uninspired to complete more than half the book. I suppose I'll get around to it at some point, but I'm in no hurry."
1,Some stories are just not meant to be shared,"I don't understand the purpose and premise for this book, I also need to know the musical background that makes him an officianado on this subject."
3,Hmm..,"I bought this speaker a year ago as a starter for 2.1 speakers. I'm surprised to see that it is one of the top selling speakers, because the quality is not that good for me.Pros:-looks very nice on my desk-easy to use, adjust volume-can control bass with subwoofer nobsCons:-really lacks mid-range and sounds muddy.-sounds distorted when turned up loud.-total system power is 60 watts, that means this speaker has a big limit when you want louder or better sounds.If you want top-notch speakers, don't buy this speaker. With 30 dollars, I would rather buy JBL speaker without subwoofer than this one."
2,Really obnoxious lack of mid-range,"There's a range of low-mid frequencies that are too high for the sub and too low for the main 2"" speakers to handle without distorting the hell out of them. It makes listening to music with relatively low acoustic string instrument notes really unpleasant. Not what I paid for; I would like to be able to listen to Joanna Newsom without cringing every time, please. Not sure I'm ever buying a Creative product again."
3,lacks frequency responce in the middle range,"I got the speakers on sale for $20, by the specs, they seemed to be inferior to the Logitech x230. They have pretty good bass, the sound is crisp at high pitch, but... if your music has a little more variety other than rock and rap, you will notice that the sound is not so good. I am talking about classical and vocal music (country would probably fit the same category). There is just too much distortion. I will keep them for now, because as a college student, i am on a tight budget, but i am looking forward to getting something better."
4,"Great Speakers, great price","These are great speakers for the price. Clear highs and mediums, and powerful bass. No interference from cell phones which is also a plus (unless you hold them right next to the speakers). My only complaint is that the bass vibrates a little if turned up too high. Standard Amazon shipping is fast and dependable, if a bit expensive (would have been nice to have Super Saver Shipping)- got these a day before the stated arrival dates."
4,T3100 2.1 Speakers,Great speakers for the price. We use them for gaming and they put out quality sound for the price.
5,computer 3.1 speaker system,Excellent product. Best bang for the buck. entire audio range is faithfully reproduced by this trio of speakers. thank you
2,"Was great, until one of the speakers quit working","I bought these speakers back in 2007 for $100. Love them, great sound for your money and I was perfectly content. But for the past few months they started making crackling noises and cutting out. Today, the left desktop speaker has quit working altogether. Warranty is 1 year, so I am out of luck.This has me doubting the longevity of the product, since I am not a heavy user and take good care of my things. Guess I learned my lesson, buy cheap buy twice!"
2,get the LOGITECH X-230 instead,"i just got those speakers and the sound isn't good at all,if it weren't for the BASS,those speakers would sound like a pair of cheap $4.99 speakers.they also feel cheapish .i own also the LOGITECH X-230 which sounds much better and is also cheaper.get the LOGITECH instead!!!!"
2,Just a complain,"I just want to complain about the price.Yesterday, I bought it in the price of $41.16 but today the price goes down to $32.35.Oh my god, what happens here?Why Amazon do like this to me?I'm your customer for a long time, buy many of your things.However, if you want to buy this thing or other, I recommend you just wait to make sure that Amazon does not play this trick to you all again."
3,Good but ...,"I just got these to replace my Labtec 2424's, which, sadly, I can't get anymore. The Inspire's are a good solid sounding speaker for the money, but the on/off knob has developed a crackle when you turn it on and sometimes it takes a second for the full range of sound to come trough. I'm probably going to return them and get another set. Hopefully, that'll fix the problem. Overall though, based on sound quality for the price, these are good. Just don't crank them up too loud unless you turn down the bass or the sub. It get's a little squirrly when pushed too hard."
2,Not bad...,"...for a debut novel. But the ending wraps up too quickly, and without any real resolution for any of the plots. I was entertained throughout, but disappointed when I realized that it ended so abruptly.BTW, the enclosed CD was a nice touch, but The Neilds have much more mature voices than the girls, Randi and Gellie, would have so it was odd when I heard them singing."
2,"Not what you'd expect from Henckels, they make far better.","After using a friends set of Henckels, I thought I'd grab a set for myself. What I've discovered in my research is Henckels now makes some cheaper quality and cheaper priced knives as well as their high quality stuff. Fortunately, they have an easy way to identify which is which. The higher quality knives have the original ""Twins"" logo (looks like two little stick figures side by side) where the cheaper sets have just a single little stick figure man. They still make some very nice sets, this particular one isn't one of them. Just look for the twins and you'll get a much nicer set."
1,Not What You Would Expect From Henckels,"I recently ordered this set of Henckels knives based on my experience with Henckels in the past. Although I have never owned my own set of Henckels, I have used a set and was very impressed with them. Unfortunately, this particular line of Henckels knives didn't meet my expectations. The knives were very light and the blades are quite thin. In fact, there is quite a bit of flexibily in the blades themselves. The chef's knife was especially disappointing. I was expecting Henckels quality for a great price. I suppose the bottom line is you get what you pay for."
2,disappointed,"one of the blades broke within 3 weeks, and the box does not contain any warranty information or an (800) number to call the company for a replacement."
4,Miker1622,I've owned this set for over a year now with no real complaints. The knives have performed beyond my expectations. They keep an edge despite daily use and abuse.If I could improve anything at all about the set it would be the steak knives. These are thinner than the rest of the knives but are more than adequate to the task.
3,"A lot of knives, but none of them live up to the brand","Those familiar with the Henckels line of chef and other knives will be disappointed with this set. If you're expecting fine German steel, good balance and heft, finely-honed edges and the heavy, secure handles typical of Henckels' better knives, then spend a little more money and stay away from this cheap set of lightweight Chinese knockoffs. The edges were sharp but rough and the handles angular and uncomfortable. If you're simply looking for a first-time set that you expect to replace/upgrade in the future, there are several other Chinese-made sets just as good but at half the cost of this set. The block is nice, but that alone doesn't make up for the overall inferiority of the set."
1,Not Recommended,I received these knives as a wedding present. I have had them for three years and can't even cut a tomato properly with them. I was visiting my sister in law who had a Henckels set and I was amazed at how well they were cutting. It was then I finally found out about the different lines (she had the higher quality ones). I will definitely be upgrading either with better quality Henckels or Wusthofs in the very near future.
1,"Light, cheap and way too thin","I purchased this after reading many positive reviews. When I received it I was greatly disappointed. These feel nothing like Henckel knives. They are light, off-balance and the blade is so super thin they feel like they will snap at the first sign of pressure. I cut about 5 items with these knives to test them out and then promptly returned then. These seem to be a cheap alternative to the more expensive, but better quality higher-end knives Henckels makes."
4,great buy,"these are great knives at this price. they are very sharp and look expensive. they are not the ""twins"" but henckels has made a good product affordably!"
3,not dishwasher safe,"This set claims to be dishwasher safe, but it's not. Mine rusted in just 7 days, so if you have a family who use these knives for just about everything, you're going to spend a lot of time handwashing. I've noticed that some Henckels sets say that J.A. Henckels does not recommend using a dishwasher, but these ones don't say that anywhere. They are nice knives that are well-designed, yet their claim of dishwasher safe is wrong"
5,gift,We gave this to our daughter and son-in-law for a Christmas gift. They seemed to be very happy with them.
4,making out #25,I found this book to be jumping around a lot now that most of the gang has left the Island. Also the book just ended in midair. For people who are Lara fans won't be happy with the way this book turns out. In all this wasn't one of her best books but is was good.
5,No one will Forget About Lara,"This book added wonderfully to the rest of the series. With most of the gang off at college, they are about to explore a new type of living- no parents and tons of responsibility. With Zoey at Berkley, Claire at MIT, Aisha and Aaron at Harvard, Lucas, Nina and Lara are left all alone on the island. This book was basically about this bad dream Lara kept having that came true at the end causing a tramuatic ending. This book had the saddist ending of all the books in the series. If you read it you'll understand why you have to agree with me."
1,No value...,"I am not very certain how there are so many 5 star rating for this book!!! Honestly, either all the ratings are rigged in some way, or the authors themselves are providing their own feed back.This book is an absolute waste of time in my opinion. I have been working on Java for almost 4+ years now. This is one of such books where the authors try to explain every thing on a pop-up menu, or why the menus are gray instead of blue (or whatever...). pun intended.Why would anybody waste time and resources to write such books? more so, i wonder why people read such books in the first place.Also, i have noticed that for every bad review, there will be 2 new good reviews (5 stars) added immediately!!! hmmm think about the odds."
2,It does have one saving grace,"I have to agre with the other negative reviews here. My primary complaints:* The book is little other than the help section and tutorials repackaged.* Even what has been repackaged is unclear. The authors do little other than describe procedural steps.* No added value one would expect in a book like this, e.g. tips or tricks, hidden features, etc.* This is a book on Sun One Studio, not Java. The authors should have realized this, and left out the poor Java examples and explanations.All of that said, the value that this book provides is that it *is* a book! I'm a reference book kind of guy, and I like to have this information at my fingertips, perhaps with several books open on my desk at any one time. You can't always do that with online help. That is the book's saving grace."
5,Fulfills a long existing gap,"I am a programmer working on sun technologies. I do keep experimenting and testing new ideas. This also reflects on my habit of trying new books. Recently I chanced upon this book, and I'm glad I did! i feel this books takes a very hands-on apprach by way of screen shots and illustractions. the lanuage is also simle and lucid. Strongly recommended!!"
5,Gas Sender with Guage Works Great,The combination of the Sunpro Fuel Level Sender and Gas Guage works very well. The readings are accurate and there is great flexibility on how this item can be installed. The only negative is that the sender is somewhat sensitive to the sloshing of the gas in the tank but this is only a very minor issue. It shows the sensitivity of the unit.
2,Marginal at best,DON'T BUY THIS UNIT; CHEAPLY CONSTRUCTED AND FAILED IN SHORT ORDER. I ordered this item along with the matching dash gauge and installed both myself. Installation seemed fairly straight forward however this unit not easily adaptable to shallow tanks. Once installed it never read over 5/8ths full even when tank was freshly topped up. That soon became wild swings in the gauge and would only read at all for the first few gallons of use. Lately it stopped working all together.Took sender out of tank and found the windings inside the pivot portion had severed and were probably keeping the float from even going into the range where it still worked. In my estimation they used too fine a wire for the resistance windings and the rubbing action wore through it way too soon. Would not buy this unit again!!
3,Installed but not used yet,"This was a easy install, i woiuld reccomend to any one who need a replacement on anyting old school or custom build, it is fully adjustable and easy to install."
1,sunpro Fuel sending unit,"The instructions are poor and the unit will not work with my application. Apparently, there are different types of resistors used on sending units. The resistor on this unit will not work with my fuel gage. The unit can be modified to work, but only by someone with advanced mechanical skills."
5,M38A1 Proper!,"This thing will work on a 1964 M38A1 under seat fuel tank with one new hole drilled, so don't let anyone tell you can't use your fuel new fuel gauge ( 12 volt )"
1,fule level sending unit,the diameter of the shaft was too large to allow insertion into the existing hole in my fuel tank.very disappointed.
2,Not that impressed.,"Three of the larger knifes had poorly defined tips and/or sharpened blades. On two, the tip was bent slightly - it seemed there was excess metal at the end of one. The third had burrs along the cutting edge that would probably be left in food when used for cutting. Attempts to contact the company haven't been successful yet; voice mail for Customer Service was 'Full' and unavailable. They are very sharp, however, and should work well, if I can get satisfactory replacements."
1,Henckles knives,I purchased the 13piece cutlery and have been dis-satified with the product due to their claim it doesnt need to be sharpened and they dont rust. The amount of money I spent for these supposed great knives is a real turn off on buying this product again. I cannot even find out who to contact to get them replaced or get my money back. Not happy!
2,"If you like using a hacksaw blade to cut food, this is for you.","I received these as a gift 3 years ago to replace a hand-me down set I was given after a family member bought new knives. I hate these knives and wish I would have returned them. The serrated edges are terrible at cutting and almost as worthless for chopping. When cutting or removing skin from poultry, the serrated edges snag the skin and meat, making it difficult to get a clean cut. The steak knives are pitiful, and as one reviewer indicated, the teeth pick up bits of meat which accumulate on the blade. You can hear the blade sawing through the meat, which is why I liken these knives to a hacksaw. I cook a lot, and I dread using these knives. So much so, that I've resurrected the set these were supposed to replace which have smooth blades. I'll gladly sharpen those old knives every so often to avoid using the ""eversharp"" set.The only positive thing about these knives is that they are indeed quite sharp."
5,"Simple, but amazingly usable","Excellent helper to all who need to lose weight. Helps even afterwards. I am using one myself, and cannot think of enough praise. Things that can easily be forgotten, get done ... and all the reminding is happening without anybody knowing about it. It's a mate for those who do not like the whole world to discuss their losing weight."
3,Vietcong2,I like combat games when you have choices. You are able to clean out the town or area you are in. Not so in this one. I had fun with it. Maybe it just me.
1,junk,"I picked this up at big lot's for 6 bucks and I still feel like i've been ripped off, I can't understand the high system requirments for this game when the graphics look like they are from a game from 1999! I have amd athlon 64 3500+ 2.0gigs of ram,nvidia geforce 7600gs oc 512mb graphics card, soundblaster audigy 4. my system eats up most games on max settings for breakfast! but this game chugged along like a turtle with 3 legs! stay away from this pile!"
2,Text Not Well Written,"The author makes difficult references to anthropolgical terms and studies which in turn make the text unclear to students. He also relies to much and quotes too frequently the work of other authors, making the text choppy and hard to read. Finally, he forgets the basic english concept of ""parallel structures"". Sanabria will formulate a paragraph or section one way in the beginning and change the structure of said paragraph or section towards the end. This makes it hard to realize/fully comprehend the author's point. This is a shame because the information is very interesting, but the text is written more like an ethnography for the Anthropological community than an indroductry class text."
5,Quick service,"I order this book online a month before the class was due to start, thinking it would take a while to receive it. The sender shipped it immediately and I received it quikcer than I thought."
3,literate hyperbole about a hyperbolic(enigmatic)literateur,"If architecture is, as THEY say the new vehicle (read: concrete expression as opposed to ephemeral longings) for comprehension in a generation that has (somehow...miraculously) evolved beyond the banal excesses of the pepsi (mtv,kfc) generation, then p. greenaway can be seen as the last bastion of that segment of the mono(poly)cultural elite that presumes proprietorship of the means and realms of cultural production. The king of obsession is dead, long live etc. The days are over (or ending, it is to be hoped) when monomphallic polymaths expressing their own particularities are replaced by truly cross cultural and multi media artists, not those pretending to be either open-minded (shocking) or erudite (cryptic). This book both gains and suffers from bearing the true attributes of PG's work; at times beautiful, at times enlightening, and at times pretentious and didactic. Sadly, and similarly, not often enough all of the above."
1,This product does not stretch.,Has almost no lycra or any other 'stretchable' fabric. It was difficult to get on and off. Didn't breathe well.
2,Not in line with rest of manufacturer's products,"I was disappointed in this. It is as if the cups are stuck on the front, and very small. I bought a 34DD, and I don't know anyone with large breasts that stick out only in front, like a mannequin, or Barbie. The cups have no support, either. I'm sticking with Flexees."
1,"Too warm, too short, no way!","My mother and my aunt swear by Lipo in a Box so I purchased it in a Large. I went with the larger size according to the directions to go up a size if you're on the sizing ""line"". Many slimmers are too short in the torso and this one is no exception. (I'm 5'6"", size 10) and I tried pulling it up as far as possible and lengthening the straps. Within minutes the underwire was two inches below my breasts giving me a saggy kind of look. The three hooks in the crotch are very uncomfortable and I was SO warm in this garment I was sweating before I even left my house. And I'm always cold. The fabric feels nice to the hand and it did not make me feel like I was a stuffed sausage like other slimmers. It does smooth everything out - however it smooths EVERYTHING out so much that my curves were lost. It made my breasts looks smaller and my stomach and hips look like they were all in one line. For $[...], this thing needs to fit A LOT better."
2,Disappointed,"I have to say I am rather disappointed with this item. Considering its price, I was expecting a firm control garment. It's not that it isn't well constructed and it is very comfortable, but it isn't anything approaching what I would call 'firm-control'. I don't think it would qualify for the title 'moderate-control'either. Much too expensive for what is essentially a light control briefer."
1,Totally Disappointed!!!,"I have to say that I am totally disappointed with this item. I was expecting a firm control garment. It's not firm at all and provides little to no support. This was one of the most expensive control body suit on amazon, therefore, I was highly disappointed. I have purchased less expensive control garments by bali and flexess that gave twice the support of this so called ""lipo in a box"". Don't let the name fool you. I ordered this item based on the other customers reviews and I am totally disappointed. BTW, did I mention that the company that sells this item DOES NOT GIVE REFUNDS ONLY EXCHANGES!!! That's a red flag. Had I known that I would not have ordered it. I do not want anything else from this company. So I lost $76.00!"
4,comfortable,"I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable this product was on the first wearing. I have had others in the past that made me feel like I was put in a ""vice!"" Putting it on was a little trickey, but once it was on I hardly knew I was wearing any shapewear. I wore it for about 8 hours on the first wearing. I am plus sized, so I was happy that I bought the model with the underwire. I needed that extra support."
2,Heavy handed Christianity-not for all,"I ordered this book set and read it just this week. I understood it to have a Christian perspective but it puts more emphasis on the Christianity than the experience of puberty. I found it to be informative enough, but rather heavy handed in the Christian zone. I was assuming that the book would have the Christian perspective more on the love/marriage/sexuality areas rather than having one's period being one of God's glories. I just wanted to be on the record that THIS BOOK MAY NOT BE FOR EVERY CHRISTIAN. I can add my own bible verses if I feel it's necessary....there really should have been more of the physiological and emotional arenas explored. I plan to return the set."
2,"Didn't Fit a Visio 32"" LCD","The Peerless SF640 is not designed for a Visio 32"" LCD TV, even though it says it will fit -- the adapter bracket fasteners didn't fit the Visio. I had to send this one back and order a SF650 which according to Peerless is the correct fit.You might want to call Peerless at 800-865-2112 to determine the correct model that will fit your TV."
1,NOT FOR LARGE FLAT SCREENS!!!,"This product had the description that said it would fit flat screen TV's up to 46"", when in reality, it should only be for small TV's. The holes on the back of my TV were set too far apart for this mount because it is a 42"" and needs a more supportive wall mount. We ended up sending it back because it just wouldn't fit. The description shouldn't say it will fit most TV's up to 46"" when there's no way it can. The mount felt too lightweight to hold up my 42"". Would only be good for small TV's!!! The only redeeming aspect of this mount is that it came with all of the hardware separated out into individual packages, very clearly labeled! That would make installation much faster and more accurate. Don't waste your time or your money if you have a large flat screen!"
3,Product title is suspect,"The wall mount worked great and as expected for a Samsung 23"" LCD TV but did not fit a Samsung 46"" LCD TV. I suspect the product's title should be changed to ""...23""-26""..."" instead of ...23""-46"" based on my engineering experience."
4,Definitely worth it.,"This mount comes with everything you need to adapt it to any of the models it is designed to work with. Kind of hard to tighten the final retaining screws but a very nice , secure mount. I wasn't able to find any tv mounts in town that were less than $100 bucks. This is a good buy. Check the peerless website to see which mount is designed for your exact flat screen."
3,missing parts,Very good product once i went out on my own to get new screws for it that fit in my tv. very good communication about me returning product. As of right now it is hanging on my wall.
5,Works as advertised,"I used this mount to hang a 42"" Olevia. The bracket came with all the necessary parts to hang the television. I checked on Peerless' site to verify that this bracket would work for my television model.Overall I am very happy with the results."
2,Careful - picture is deceiving and may not be right for your TV,"We have a 42 inch LCD, and based on the picture (never mind the description) it looked like it would be an easy fit. There should be a ruler in the picture because the mount is small - too small for many TVs above 40"" unless you have a model with mounting holes that are freakishly close together. Make sure to measure the distance between mounting holes on your TV so that you can pick the bigger mount if necessary (and not have to pay to ship it back like us)."
4,Recomment,"I love it .. it look good for my flat tv .. 32inch , it can go up to 42 inch ..good product recomment"
1,"Does NOT fit MOST 42"" or larger TVs!!!","I was searching for a mount for my new 42"" plasma TV, and found this on Amazon. Fortunately, I read the reviews and saw several complaints that this mount didn't fit certain TVs. I then went to the manufacturer's site, peerlessindustries.com, and looked up this model. Right on their product page for this item, the manufacturer warns that this model will NOT fit most TVs 42"" and higher. So, unless you want to take a chance, don't get this if your TV is 42"" or more. They really shouldn't sell a product named as a universal wall mount for 22""-49"" TVs, then have a disclaimer on their site that it won't fit many 42""+ TVs!!! UPDATED 8/23/08- the disclaimer appears to be no longer on their site but I do not know if the product has actually been changed. If you search online you will find many complaints that the mount doesn't fit many 42""+ TVs, so be warned to be carefully when considering this."
1,it does not fit,"I purchased this to mount my lcd tv, 42"". It even comes with the make and model of the flat screen stating it will fit. It does not. It is to small and will not reach the holes on the back."
2,Tiger Direct needs to fix their ad on Amazon,"This wall mount did not fit the 42"" TV that I bought it for. Not even close to the span needed. When I called Tiger Direct they were very good and refunded my money (thus the 2 stars instead of 1). The ad for the same mount on their web site provided the necessary info to keep someone from buying this mount when they needed a larger one, but that is not very helpful after the fact. Amazon and Tiger Direct need to get together to make the info consistent."
3,"Beware if 37"" or greater ... !!!","I bought 2 of this item after checking with the manufacturer site for compatibility. It fits very well for my 32"" Toshiba but it is way too small for the 42"" LG. Be very careful if your TV's greater than 37""."
5,great for the price,"We purchased this for a 32 in. tv. It was easy to install and held the tv nicely without seeing any of the bracket. It was an inexpensive wallmount, but does the job. I would highly recommend it."
3,Get what you pay for...,Not universal. wanted to hang a Sony 32 but could not fit to back of unit. Lack of longer screws stopped me in my tracks
1,It didn't fit!,"Despite the fact the manufacturer website specifically confirmed the make/model of my LCD TV, the mount did not fit my 42"" Phillips LCD. The height of the mount did not fit the holes in the back of the LCD. What a waste of time. I ended up buying a mount from Costco."
3,Carefully check compatability!,"CAREFULLY check to see if your TV will fit this unit. It is listed as fitting TV's of 23-46"" however the 42"" and 46"" that it actually fits are VERY limited. Check peerless's site to type in your TV model, and it will pop up EXACTLY what you need. Then come back on over to Amazon to buy it because they charge 2x-3x as much dirrectly from the peerless site."
1,UNIVERSAL is NOT Universal...,"Purchased this on February 2, 2009 from Amazon - great service from Amazon. Received it in two days.Problem #1 - our studs are 18 inches apart, but the spacing on the wall bracket is only for 16-inch spacing for wall studs. I can only hope that mounting it onto one stud will provide sufficient strength - but I cannot tell because it isn't mounted yet...Problem #2 - I own a Vizio VX32L LCD TV. It requires the M8 1.25mm screws to mount to the wall. This size screw is not included in the Peerless kit, and if you buy them at your local hardware store, guess what - the vertical brackets groove isn't big enough to accommodate the screw. So, I'm pretty much ""screwed"".I may try and drill the grooves out a little to give them enough room for the mounting screws, but I'm not sure if I'm going to mess with it or not.Be careful - just because it says it is universal does NOT mean it will work with all TV's."
2,Not the best Wall Mount in the world.,"First off the description didn't mention this mount was for walls with studs upto 16"" apart. Most newer homes are built with the studs further apart 23""-24"". Had to mount it soley on the drywall. The instruction manual could not be anymore confusing because it provides instructions not only for the model you purchase but for every other model wall mount....no need for that. Once up on the wall....finally...the function of it serves well but let me tell you putting it together was no cake especially since it's not the right size for my 37"" TV. Due to the distance from stud to stud on my wall the recommended mount is the extra larger one 30"" wide which is for TV's up to 60""."
4,does the job for much less,I've got a Sony 40 inch W series mounted on the bedroom wall with this for about a month now with no problems. Installation was fairly easy. Just didn't have the correct length of screws so I went ahead and used the longer ones included in the package by adding additional washers to tighten the fit. Overall a good experience and a good buy. I recommend it.
5,awesome tv mount for the money,"bought this mount on the cheap for my 37"" phillips and it worked great. I have an older home with plaster on top of sheetrock walls, makes it almost impossible to find studs through the walls, dont have to worry here, because the included hardware is great, easily secured mount into wall and hung from it with my hands (285lbs) tv mounted easily and love the tilting screws feature. great buy."
2,Universal Wall Mount,"This mount is ok for a small TV. I bought it for a 42"" Vizio and it was too small. I understand you can buy extensions for them. I didnt know where to look so I had to buy another mount. Be careful when buying a TV mount online as there are other considerations other than TV size. They are the width of the mounting bracket and the weight limit that it will hold."
2,Does the job. Hardware fitment and quality issues,"The washers supplied did not fit over the larger bolts to fasten mounts on the set. Annoying, but workable for the price. Holds my 40"" LCD just fine."
1,Compatibilty Information Missing,"Since the description says ""Universal Wall Mount for 23""-46"" Flat Panels"" people tend to assume that what it means. What a waste of people's time and effort to leave out the important compatibility information that this cheap pile only fits some plasma TV's."
2,CHECK YOUR VESA SPECIFICATION.,"This mountd DID NOT FIT my Samsung 42"" plasma. The stantions are too short for a VESA 600 wich have the mounting bolts at 15.75in on center vertically. The stantions for this mount are only 13in. Also, if your TV uses the large 4mm M8 size mounting screws, this kit does not include them and they're too big for the holes in the stantions. Check your TV mounting dimensions BEFORE buying this mount."
3,Good product,"This wall mount does exactly what it is supposed to, and it is extremely secure if assembled as per the instructions. However, it is extremely hard to hang, and will make it difficult to get to inputs if they are in the middle of the back of the tv."
3,Check first if this product will fit your TV,"It's easy to be misled about the word ""Universal"" and the TV size it's supposed to fit with on most online wall mount descriptions. Problem is that I only found out after getting this product that it doesn't fit my 42"" Philips LCD model.One kudo to Peerless is the ease of using their web site to check by manufacturer and model. That alone made me give them 3 stars instead of 1. I've looked at other manufacturers and their web sites have the bare minimum info which is far from adequate. I was able to find the right model for my TV after entering that info onto the web site.So to all those shopping for mounts, I cannot stress enough how important it is to double-check the width of the mount (see Tech Specs) to see if it's longer than the mounting position on the back of your TV. Check the manufacturer's web site too and hopefully it'll have good info, a few of them I looked at didn't have any useful info."
3,Need the right screws,I was able to use this item but none of the screws were the right size to fit in the Brand name TV I purchased. I had to go out and purchase my own. Otherwise it was fine.
4,Tight squeeze for cables,"Mount was easy to install came with every size screw and bolt imaginable. The low profile and non-tilt aspect make for tougher cord installation, two person project. Also if TV is not recessed where cables are plugged in it is a little snug to the wall, mainly the component cables not the HDMI(you can get right angle cables). This is not the fault of the mount as it is great to have the low profile and tight to the wall when finished; just a little harder to install cables intially."
3,Did NOT fit my 46 in LCD,"The product description says it fits most 32-46 flat screens. However when you open the box the first page of the instructions state clearly ""Most 42"" and larger plasma screens may not work with this mount."" The brackets were not long enough to fit our 46 inch LCD either."
5,Great Wall Mount,I hung a Samsung LN-t4071f on this and it was easy installation. All the hardware I needed was included with detailed instructions although they really weren't required. The installation took all of 30 minutes. For the price you can't go wrong.
3,Decent Bracket - Sturdy and Reasonably Priced,"Used this bracket to mount a 40"" Samsung LN-T4071F to the wall. Mounted it to studs to ensure a solid attachment.Pros:Mount is reasonably priced, sturdy/solid, and allows you to adjust the TV left and right after mounting as necessary to center in the space.Cons:While there are many mounting holes to attach to the wall, none of them are 16"" apart for standard stud spacing. I had to drill two new holes in bracket to mount to studs. Screws were provided to mount in wall, but the heads easily stripped out when trying to screw them into wood rather than the wall anchors which were provided. Included screws needed to attach to TV were not the right type so required a trip to Home Depot to get correct hardware to mount to studs and TV."
2,"Wouldn't even fit a 40""","I just bought a 40"" Philips LED. I read these reviews and figured I was safe, since I had a 40"" and not a 42"", which was where most of the problems were. But just to be safe, I checked Peerless's website, and it had my model number on their list of compatible TVs for this mount. So I got it. Unfortunately, Peerless's list sucks, because this mount wasn't even close to fitting our TV.The holes on the mounting brackets have a few settings to choose from (as you can see in the picture). The widest setting is probably like 12 or 13 inches, and the holes on our TV are 16 inches apart. Yeah, that's a BIG difference.But if this does fit your TV, it looks like it will be a good choice. It seems pretty sturdy, and it'll probably do what it's meant to do. Good luck!"
4,"Great Quality, Great Price, Locking Cams are Awkward","The quality of this TV wall bracket is outstanding! The metal is of a heavy gage and the built in level bubblers is great! Also this bracket came with a mini electronic stud finder! Once installed on the wall I was able to do pull ups on the bracket with no sign of movement (and I am no lightweight!) The only gripe I have with this wall mount was the locking cams. The screws are installed into the cams to prevent the TV from being pushed up and off of the bracket. The problem is that once the TV is on the wall the cams don't line up great and I had to use a really long magnetic screwdriver (18"") to install the lock screw and try really hard not to drop the screw. Other that that I am very pleased with the overall quality of this Flatscreen TV Wallmount and would recommend it to anybody."
3,Good product,"I bought this for my 32 inch LG TV and it fits great. It is very sturdy. The only complaint I have is how close to the wall it is. It is tough to get your hand back there. My Wii wires keep falling out and it is a pain to put them back in. I really don't want to take it off the mount to fix the problem, but maybe if I did it would be solved. I would definitely go with a tilting mount next time."
1,"Does not fit Dynex 42""","As many other people have noted, the listing on Amazon calls it universal and says it will fit virtually any 42"" flat screen. It doesn't. Small print on the manual will point that out to you right away, and you'll realize that the bars that attach to the TV aren't long enough to fit all 4 holes for mounting on the back. Go to their website first and put in your model number and it will tell you for sure. Too bad Amazon didn't include that info here."
1,TV wall mount,"Do not purchase this mount if you have a 40"" or larger TV it will not fit as advertised and you will get charged with the postage and a RE-STOCKING fee for your refund ..........."
1,This doesnt' work,I wanted this to work so badly since it's natural but it didn't do anything for my acne. It's a waste of money.
2,Ok product,I have to say this is the this is one of the best natural products for acne and it arrived on time if you want natural get this product. The thing is that no matter how much you want to use all natural products sometimes there is no substitute for the other stuff. I try to use as much natural stuff as I can but for acne that's one of the things I can't use but for other than acne I would defiantly use kiss my face products.
2,Ineffective,"The smell and gentleness were great, but the product did not seem to help banish blemishes. I used it for at least a couple weeks, and my breakouts somehow became worse. I'm not sure if the product had something to do with that or if it just failed to help at all. I had high hopes for this since I'm a proponent of natural ingredients and it cost so much, but it really seemed to fail at its task. Also, I wish it would list the percentage of tea tree oil, because products supposedly need 5% to be effective against acne."
4,Pleased,I haven't used this for very long yet but so far it seems fairly effective. I only have to apply a tiny bit-it spreads easily over my entire face.
2,Disappointed...,I really thought I would like this product but whenever I put it on my face the peppermint is so strong that it burns my eyes. My eyes end up watering for quite awhile. It doesn't really do anything for my skin either.
5,Significant historically for his impact on slave trade and Christianity in Africa. His suffering parallels with Brother Yun.,If you are interested in the trailblazer who paved the path into Africa for Christianity this is the book for you. He single handedly stopped the slave trade in Africa through his complete reliance on God and God alone. Just an awesome person of faith and a true testimony to humanity. He shows you what the human spirit is willing to endure for his love of others and God.
2,Disappointed,"I don't want this to sound anti-Christian, because I definitely am not. But the religious message gets in the way of what would otherwise be an interesting story."
3,goodish,"The focus of this book is on general concepts andthe theory and research on teaching, learning and technology ratherthan on hands-on assignments at the computer. It is most suitable forthose who already have basic computing skills and who are more focusedon issues of integration of technology in the classroom. It is gearedtoward answering the question: What would a teacher do differently ifs/he used computers in her/his classroom? This book links actualpractice to both underlying theories of teaching and learning, helpingreaders develop their own framework for thinking about educationalcomputing. Covers constructivist models oftechnology use, hypermedia and multimedia, and educational telecommunications. This edition also contains many screen shots toillustrate how programs look and operate. This book isintended for undergraduate or graduate courses on the use ofinformation technologies in education."
2,Stick to mechanical for oil pressure,"Sorry Sunpro, I just left an awesome review for you mechanical gauge, but I have a mechanical gauge because I tried this one first. It bounced all over the place. I don't know if it was the sender or the gauge. I tried several different manifolds (to add or substract fluid damping) which didn't work. I thought maybe it was some king of electrical disturbance so I used different wires and used a shielding sleeve to shield it from electromagnetic disturbances. Nothing worked and the readings kept bouncing. I made sure the manifold was clear and the sender opening was clean... Needless to say I went mechanical, I do use your electrical oil temp gauge which works perfect."
5,Fascinating,"One of the most troubling, and fascinating films I'v ever seen, leaving a permanent mark in my memory.Far from actual Hollywood balet fightings, this is a movie in which you get a glimpse of the street life & death, and what the power of the knife really is.Superb!"
5,It's My Favorite Knife,"At the time I purchased this knife 10 years ago I guess I didn't really appreciate the beauty of a good knife. And this IS a good knife. It seems to balance perfectly in my hand. And we don't save it for bread, we use it for anything that needs a light touch...tomatoes, cakes, etc... If you need a reliable bread knife that you're able to control perfectly, this is the one for you!"
1,CAUTION!!! Two different versions!,"There are two different CDs called ""Hippy hippy shake: The definitive collection"" here on Amazon. One from 1993 with 26 songs that's probably the best compilation there is with this band. This one you can only buy from private sellers here. And one from 2008 with 13 re-recorded songs that you can buy new for a very cheap price directly from Amazon. For some reason Amazon has chosen to put all the reviews for these two different CDs in the same place. And they put the same tracklist on both. Don't be fooled."
1,Not what I was expecting - buyer beware,"I was unlucky, I suppose. When I ordered this item (ASIN B000055Y5V), I did not get the 26 song Definitive Collection. I got the Lt Series CD titled ""The Swinging Blue Jeans - Hippy Hippy Shake"". And they say on the label ""NEW RECORDING by original artists"", copyright 2000.I'll list the 13 songs on this CD.1. You're No Good (song made famous by Linda Ronstadt)2. Good Golly Miss Molly (quite different from original)3. Hippy Hippy Shake (very close to the original)4. Angel5. Still the One6. I'm an Old Rock'n'Roller7. You Win Again (the Hank Williams song)8. Banging In My Head9. Higher Than a Kite10. Poets11. Love Machine12. Whole Lotta Trouble13. Way Down YonderI'll try again for the original recordings - maybe from Collector's Choice Music. This CD is going in the trash."
2,Wish it had more substance,"I read the book at one sitting, because I really needed some advice and help, and I'm sorry to say I was much disappointed. There were some very specific case studies (which I didn't think had much general applicability), and not much advice on how to deal with problems. There is a great deal of supportive verbiage on how tough it all is, and a lot of general information on how lots of communication is needed, etc., but not much specific. Also, all the cases referred to women who are second wives because of a husband's divorce. I needed and would have appreciated information on how to deal with marriage to someone who has been widowed--it is an entirely different set of problems, but it's no less difficult (possibly it's more difficult), and I know there would be an audience for this."
2,"Good info, but....","I found this one hard to read. I've spent the last 6 months preparing for stepmotherhood, and I realize that it's really important to keep my marriage in the forefront of my mind. This book just really didn't do it for me. I must be lucky because my fiance is just the opposite of the men portrayed here. He's supportive, loving, and considers my needs as well as the kids needs the same."
1,No Depth,"Returned immediately.Not worth it, attempts to cover too many situations and with little depth."
3,Not what you might hope for,"These knives could be worse, but given the fancy name and reputation, they could be a lot better, too. The blades are not as stiff as you might like. Flexy blades scare me not out of fear of breakage, but rather that they are harder to control and more likely to cut something you don't want cut. Also, the Chef's knife has a pretty shallow blade, and you can't do the cool chef-chop without rapping your knuckles on the cutting board. For the money, there are better (though less prestigious) knife sets out there."
3,Good for beginners...,"But if you want great knives avoid these and spend this much money on one good chef's knife. You probably won't use the other knives much anyway, except for the bread knife. Look for a carbon steel blade, these stainless steel knives will always look pretty but they'll never really be sharp."
2,Item title causes confusion. Not Pro-S series.... Fine Edge Pro Series.,"When looking at the description, ""Fine Edge Pro S"" it looked like they were describing the Pro S series knives as containing fine-edged knives. However, this is not a set of Pro S knives. Instead, it is part of the ""value"" brand Henckels sells, and the knives are ""Fine Edge Pro"" series knives. They are made in Shanghai. Honestly I haven't opened the box yet, since it was going to be a gift for someone seeking the actual Pro S knives. Well, you know, you get what you pay for, and these were really cheap (relatively). They're probably better than what you have in your kitchen now - unless you already have Pro S knives and wanted to get some more."
1,Returning this item,"Most of the knives would not fit into the block, they were too large.The santoku knife would not even cut a tomato without first piercing the tomato with the knife tip - very unsatisfactoryI realize this is an inexpensive set, but even my local supermarket sells better knives for less.very disappointing."
4,Time tested...,"I have had these knives for over 7 years now and never had an issue with one exception. The handle slipped off the sharpener....however, I could feel it going so it was never a dangerous factor. As I increase my cooking skills, I am now probably going to look for a better meat chopping knife that the 8"" and relegate that to the veggies etc.I have yet to find something these won't cut. The sharpness is good. I have alternated between the dishwasher and the sink. I usually wash withing minutes of using.You want to give someone a good sturdy relatively cheap gift...bookmark this page."
1,Not worth it,I was very disappointed with this set as I expected better from J.A.Henckels. At the end of the day I fell victim to wanting a better quality knife set without having to pay a premium price.
1,Calphalon so much better,"I used to use Henckel knifes. But I bought a set of Calphalon fine knifes and I was stunned at the impressive quality of the Calphalon set. Sharper, better grips, and better value, the new Calphalon system is a great idea.Walk away from the over priced German line of knifes and go with Calphalon (available on Amazon.com)."
5,the best Med-surg book ever.,"This book, is extremely great. I am the only student with one for now ,but everyone wants to have it, even my tutor wants one. It is nursing in it's best form.This book helps to project perfect client care."
5,Satisfied,This item was received in record time and was in excellent condition as described. Will certainly purchase from this seller again.
5,"Two brilliant, beautiful recordings on two CDs...","I hope you can read the musicians names on the cover thumbnail; if you have the money, buy it. Why did I wait so long? ""No Answer"" was recorded in '74, ""Silence"" in '77.There's a track from ""Silence"" called ""Around Me Sits the Night"" that's available on YouTube at this time (vocals by Robert Wyatt and a searing solo by Chris Spedding).Nice, nice stuff."
4,Passion and horror,"Though it's one of the hardest WoD games 2 play, it's my second favorite only surpassed by Mage.In Wraith you must face the feeling of having lost a lot, and the fear of losing a lot more. As a ghost you have to look into the living world with your Passions still atached to it, and many times you'll have to watch impotent some scene which increases your Passions. As a ghost you are made of pure Passion, after all.A tragic game that makes you comfront your darker side: your Shadow (which, by the way, is played by another player to better roleplay the eternal conflict within a Wraith). This is not a game that can be taken lightly, but if you're ready for the most passionate game ever, give Wraith a try."
4,White Wolf,"While I'm fond of Dungeons and Dragons, my heart has a special place for white wolf, and if you're any kind of white wolf fan, then you would know: this game was their destiny.Every White Wolf game is all about being miserable, even though you're an awesome demon!Well in Wraith, despite your very cool powers, there is a part of your brain trying to turn you to Shadow, and make you a servant of Oblivion, which expands greater everyday, threatening to destroy the underworld.it's a very dark game. intense."
4,The darkest of the dark,"Vampire explores the depth of your character, Werewolf explores your dedication, Mage your resourcefulness. Wraith simply searches out the point you crack, and give in. The setting is darkly superb and detailed. The gameplay is an exercise in psychosis. Quite radically different in it's gameplay to any other game I've played to date, and despite it being superbly intense, I'm afraid it now sits gathering dust on a shelf. It's not that it's unplayable (quite the opposite), it's simply that the players (and myself) refuse to play it. If you feel you can hack depression, and the intense conflict (in party) that Wraith generates, then play away... The experience is a double edged sword."
4,Not for the faint at heart,"Wraith is an excellent role-playing game. It is one of the few where you really have to play in-character. It's very intense. My friend was in a game where people were crying by the end of it. I would recomend it to experienced role-players. This edition of it does have some flaws, though. I think they should have expanded a little in a few areas, there's even a very important section missing. But it doesn't hurt the game too much. Wraith remains my all time fav!"
5,Love my New Pillow,"I just moved and have no sofa in the living room, I actually watch TV and movies on my floor I wanted a good pillow until I can afford some new furniture and this over exceeded my expectations.Highly recomend it."
5,Works great to get feet up.,"I've had this wedge for about 6 weeks and just keep it downstairs by my couch for when it's time to kick up my feet. I'm five months pregnant, so getting my feet and legs elevated is key to preventing swelling and varicose veins. Yes, it slants down, but I put a cushion or blanket on the slant. The height is perfect for my legs from butt to knee, I'm 5' 7"". Super comfy and best part is, it's tough, sturdy, not squishy or too soft. Good buy!"
2,Dull and Stains Easily,"It's a nice-looking knife, but mine arrived quite dull -- won't even cut paper. And the ""no-stain"" steel blade took a stain on first use that I can't remove."
3,"Good product, more beautiful than what is visible in the photo, buy another","Good product, more beautiful than what is visible in the photo, buy another."
3,Nice Pan but problems,It's a good pan but some problems which I would think the manufacturer could easily fix. The handle on the lid is not insulated which means it is too hot to handle and a potholder is necessary. The inside of the pan is teflon or non-stick and after six weeks has begun to chip off
5,Very Good Saucepan,"I have this saucepan for about a year now. I am very please with it. Before I own this pan, it was always a pain to clean the pot after cooking oatmeal, milk, potato... But with this nonstick pan, it's super easy. I also like the pouring function very well. No colander needed when making Macroni & Cheese, mashed potato or anything you need to boil and drain. Most of the time I use silicone spatula, sometimes wooden spoon, not a single scratch yet. I have some other KitchenAid stuff in my kitchen, happy with them all. This is a brand that I trust."
5,Wife loves the pot,My wife wanted a small red pot to replace one that was bent. I got this for her Christmas present. She loves it! She really likes the pouring spout
2,A little difficult to absorb this information,"This book was written basically for a farmer who lives in England.A lot of the nomanclature is difficult to understand.Theres good information,but it seems very regional."
1,RiPPPPPPPPP,"All I can seem to do with these knives if rip and tear. I have several of the Pro S knives and a four star and they are the greatest knives on earth. If you are going to spend the money get the Pro S, four or five stars."
4,Those darn little serrations...,These knife set is an excellent starter kit for an upcoming cook. Cost to performance is medium to high. BUT! These knives are hard to clean if food is left on the blades. The micro serrations are hard to pick between and the micro fingers can be bent. Watch out when drying these knives as well. They WILL snag your favorite drying towel in addition to your dish rag or sponge. I usually rinse them in extrememly hot water and let them air dry.
2,"Rip, hack and saw if you want...","These aren't knives--they're saws. Not for the serious cook, but okay if you just want to show off the Henkels brand and a chock-full counter-block. This is trailer-trash stuff.A good cook needs a minimum of only (3 or) 4 knives: chef's, utility, slicing and paring. A good, forged, carbon steel blade with a bit of heft is a delight in the hand, so check them out in a store before ordering.It is irksome to see a fine old name like Henkels exploiting an inexperienced--but aspiring--market. They (and others) make better knives. Spend your money wisely; don't simply consume marketing tripe."

3,So So IronMan Watch,"Pros:The watch looks great.Displays both analog & digital.Cons:Analog & digital times do not sync. If not adjusted on a regular basis will wind up(no pun intended) being way off.I've returned my unit to Timex hoping that it was just fluke but the replacement unit they sent me acts just the same.Oh well, I guess I can't expect too much from a $60 watch."
3,Nice to look at but with some drawbacks,"Very nice watch that meets the need of a pleasant looking gentleman's watch. Buy it if you're looking for an inexpensive watch that will look acceptable with business clothing or a more refined casual look. Don't buy it if you're looking for a light or accurate timepiece - it won't meet your desires. The watch is bulky, heavy, and is not synchronized with both time mechanisms."
4,A good find. A great buy,"I bought this watch about a year ago and I will admit it was because of Stranger Than Fiction. I was contemplating purchasing a more expensive swiss made watch but I feel this has been a great buy. Very accurate and solid feeling. For about 90 bucks, you can't beat it. My only gripe is the beep is very soft, so don't plan to use this as an alarm. Functional and stylish. You can display 2 time zones on the LCD. You also can turn the LCD display off to use less battery and appear a little more ""formal."""
3,"Stylish solid watch, but fatal design error","A very smart looking watch, especially with the digital face turned off. For those who like to keep their options open - chrono, alarm, laps - until they need them, packaged in a great looking watch that doesn't look like the typical sport watch. And unlike the other Timex analog watches, the Indiglo doesn't just wash over the face, it actually lights up the digital numbers. Overall a great watch for the price.REVISED Jan 2010 - So at exactly 2 years of owning this watch, the well documented problem of the analog hands stopping happened to me. Very disappointing since I used the analog face instead of the digital. I have since sent it back to Timex....we'll see what happens."
3,"Stylish, but heavy and hard to read numbers at times","I've had the watch for about a month. I like the styling, though a mix of silver and gold would be better. The watch is quite heavy, but that is not very noticeable during a busy day. The bracelet and clasp are sturdy and the clasp does not pop open.The digital numbers are hard to read from about 20 after to about 20 'til because the minute hand is over the numbers. This is worse when the hour hand is in the same area. This doesn't prevent you from telling the time but can be annoying.I also own a Timex Ironman Triathlon watch with a plastic band. I thought the button layout on this watch would be similar, but there is more difference than I expected. The alarmon this watch is not as loud nor does it beep as frequently.Overall I am happy with the purchase and would do it again."
5,Great Watch,"Love the watch!!!Pros: Features, quality feel, easy to read, can turn off digitalCons: Fairly thick, a little heavy, outer dial doesn't turnOverall, great watch for the price with all the features I wanted."
2,"""Takes a licking, then stops ticking""","You may have seen this quote elsewhere in relation to this watch.It is very stylish, easy to use and feels very solid. I especially liked the weight of the watch and metal band.The analog portion of the watch stopped after less than 9 months.To be fair, I tend to wear a watch 24/7 and I swim, ride my bicycles in all weather and generally don't stop to take off a watch before any activity.After the watch failed, I did some research to see if any others had the same experience and it appears this watch has an issue with the analog portion dying after 1-3 years.Wonder if they'd consider a toggle between digital numbers and digital hands?"
1,Watch fell apart within 3 days,Was quite surprised when parts of this watch fell off shortly after it was worn for the first time. Not sure what to do but figure I will have to go back to timex.
4,"Crystal is mineral, not acrylic.",I couldn't believe Timex would use acrylic on a watch like this. I have verified with Timex that it is indeed mineral glass.
3,Love the watch but the wrist band is low quality,"wrist band broke and I havent been able to get a replacement, cannot wear the watch any more, its so sad because i love it"
2,"Good watch, when it works",I've only owned Timex Ironman watches my entire adult life. I currently have the same watch that is getting pretty beat up and the analog hands stopped working years ago. So I ordered a new one from Watch Colony via Amazon and when it arrived the analog hands were not working out of the box! I'm very disappointed that after all of these years Timex still has not addressed the problem. Other than the watch only being 50% functional I love it.
4,Could be better...,"I admit I purchased this watch because of the movie, Stranger Than Fiction. I didn't think the watch was gonna talk to me or signal to me when a cute girl walked by, but I did have certain expectations that were not met and I think other people should know about.The Analog and Digital times do NOT sync. The movie indicated that they did... Also the indiglo is extremely dim, so much so that I have to say I am dissapointed in Timex for such a thing. I have had much cheaper watches with much better lights. Finally, the alarms are ridiculously quiet. With that kind of volume there is no purpose in having the alarm feature at all.However the clean face of the watch is very nice. Fitting is simple. The steal band and frame are very nice. 4 out of 5 since the price was so reasonable, but really Timex how hard would it have been to put a decent indiglo and audible alarms into it?"
4,"Nice watch, nice price","I was looking for a dressier watch that I could also use for workouts. This seemed to fit the bill. I'll second the reviews that the watch is thicker and far heavier that I expected, not on par with other digital training watches. That said, I like the looks and despite the weight and thickness, the face size doesn't dwarf my regular wrist size. From a training perspective it doesn't stack up to my previous ironman-100 lap watch. I miss the ability to retain multiple work outs... my 100 lap ironman, kept the date, duration and lap times of each workout until the memory was full. It was a very nice feature. This watch only retains one workout and no timestamp. The battery life is suspect as well and I'm sure having to use the indigo feature to set things is a significant drain. Given the option, I'd purchase again unless I found either a solar powered version or a lighter version."
4,Very Good,"It functions well and is stylish. It's a little too heavy but I don't mind that. The lens, so far, has stood up to some bumps and scraps... where previous watches have not fared as well. The hands of the clock face sometimes get in the way of seeing the digital display and the hands should be reflective without the dayglow feature needing to be activated but they are not or they are too faint to see clearly (can't tell which is true.)Not withstanding the above notes... over all I am pleased with the watch."
5,Great Timepiece!,"Just really great Feedback from my buddy who received this Ironman watch for his BD gift, from me..I picked this watch, because of it's unique features, ratings and the fact that it first caught my eye, when I saw it featured in a movie. In the movie, it was worn by Will Ferrell, in 'Stranger Than Fiction'.Feedback is:* Stainless Steel bracelet > Solid feeling!* Functions in Dual Mode, LED + Sweep Hands* Large number digits, easy to see* Silent Blue Glow Light alarm, Extra Cool!* H2O proof* May be worn as a dress timepiece"
2,Beware timer function for the Combo Tiathlon,"I purchased this Triathlon watch thinking that it's timer function worked like my old one. I was wrong. This model does not allow the timer function to stop and reset itself for an established time period. On this model, each of the three timer loops will continue to repeat themselves for their set time period or if all are set, go through each one in sequence and then repeat. This type of timer function would be great for an exercise rotation program, but not for my purpose. I think the plastic 100 lap Triathlon watch is the model which has the various timer functions. I wanted the metal Combo face Duel Tech feature and was disappointed when it arrived."
4,"Nice Watch, had to have a jeweler adjust metal watch band","Nice watch. It is a bit heavy and I had to have a jeweler adjust the metal band. An added cost if you buy on the web since a store would do it for free. The manual that came with the watch did not have instructions for the band for this watch. Timex customer service said they have a generic manual for these watches, pretty crummy answer....To adjust the band a metal pin has to be pushed through and re-inserted. The pin is very small and very tight. I did not have a tool that would accomplish it without possible damage to the watch. Otherwise happy with the watch."
5,I left my job,WHEN I RECIEVED THIS WATCH WOMEN STARTED TO ASK ME ALL THE TIME WHAT TIME IT IS THEN THEY STARTED TO PLAY WITH MY WRIST AND HANDS WELL ONE OF THEM OWNED A BAKERY AND WOULD MAKE ME CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES ALL NIGHT LONG AND SHE WOULD HELP THE HOMELESS IN MY AREA SO NOW IM KEEPING TIME WITH MY TIMEX WATCH FOR THE COOKIES WHEN THEY SHOULD BE BROUGHT OUT OF THE OVEN AND SHE HAS BECAME MY WIFE THANK YOU TIMEX I WILL NEVER FORGET YOU WHAT A GREAT WATCH
1,DOA,"busted on arrival. buttons did not work... also, pic on amazon suggests a white face; it's not, it's silver."
4,good,"watch is ok, but but The functions of the watch are not as expected, and ask questions when the seller Pro Sport Watches, which supports the person does not know much about the products they sell."
2,Not as impressive as I'd hoped,"Although it's a decent watch, this Timex is not as solid nor as ""nice"" as I had hoped. The clasp does not feel very sturdy, and I'm afraid that it will not hold up over time. I realize it's relatively inexpensive as far as men's watches go, I probably just got my hopes up that it would be a nicer watch."
3,"Good watch and price, but some flaws","The good:--Good looking watch (although will probably never use the feature that will allow you to blank off the digital display)--For the price it is a good quality watch, with a solid heft.--The indiglo is bright as advertised.Not bad, but a little irksome:--quite a thick watch and is best for someone with a big wrist--The digital numerals could be wider. I know they have to fit it within the confines of the circle, but the time is often obscured by the hour and minute hands. (It is just natural for one to look at digital first and foremost when given the option)--This may be my problem, but I still have a problem with getting all the functions to work--probably my biggest irritation.--The digital and the non-digital hands do get out of whack slightly with each other, but not a big deal.It is a gray lcd background, not white. still looks nice."
5,"Good, solid watch","This watch is great. It has a good solid feel to it. It looks great and is sporty, so you can use it for any occasion. It has everything I need in a watch and still isn't overly expensive. I would highly recommend it."
4,What I wanted,I wanted a nice looking masculine digital face watch for both casual and sport jacket occasions. It fits the bill.
5,Good Cheap Watch,"For the price ($60) this watch isn't too bad. I got it because I wanted something that looks nice when I go to meetings but am not afraid of losing it while i am travelling (India, Thailand, Australia). Many people have asked me where they can get a watch like this. I have even took it for a couple dives in the ocean (100 ft!). I have had Timex in the past and this is another great classy watch for the price. Another cool feature about this watch is you can turn on and off the digital by holding the start/stop button. I would definetly recommend this watch to anyone looking for a good cheap watch."
1,I bought this watch at target,SHADY! This may sound crazy but I bought this watch at Target in Delaware for (no lie) like $60. I am shocked and floored that it is now 300 bucks. I damaged the watch in Iraq while I was serving with the Air Force and wanted to buy another one. But $300 this has to be a joke. WOW that is out of control! Someone lost their mind at TIMEX.
1,Disappointing analog failure,"Nice looking unit. Very accurate time-keeper like all of the Timex quartz watches I have owned. Worked fine for one year, then the analog watch quit, but the digital still works."
3,Bracelet Too small,"Was greatly disappointed to get the watch and find the bracelet was too ""small"". No way to adjust it larger as it was already adjusted to maximum size. First watch I've ever gotten where I didn't have to take at least one link out to fit so I really wonder if this is a Mens watch rather than for a boy.Watch looked nice, was heavy and the right size, digital and analog is what I wanted and the back light works great in the dark, but can't keep it since it doesn't fit.I suppose that I could go somewhere and have a link added, but there was nothing in the sparse documentation that indicated that was possible.So unless my son can use it (it fits him fine), it will be returned and I will once again start the watch search."
3,Not quite worthy of the Iron-Man brand,"Had the watch for a little over the one-year warranty before the hands got stuck , as other reviewers have said. Also was bummed that the hands and digital displays worked independently and had to work to keep them in sync."
3,"Decent watch, but won't last for too long","This was a very nice watch for the price that I paid for it. You'd think that it should have costed way more. I personally never used the timer/triathlon features of this watch so I can't say much about it.I am content with my purchase of this watch except that my analog hands suddenly stopped working after 3 years. This wasn't a huge issue for me as I could still use the digital aspect of the watch, but not having working analog hands bothers me because I really liked turning off the digital background and just using the watch hands to tell time."
4,Great while it lasted,"Wore this watch daily for about two years. Heavy, but loved the functionality. Analog time function broke after two years, so I stopped wearing it, though now 1.5 years later, the digital function is still soldiering on. Biggest downside is weight, and the fact the the light turns off when any other button is pressed, which makes setting an alarm in a dark room virtually impossible."
2,Great Watch! Horrible Price!,OUTRAGEOUS! About four or five years ago I bought this watch from Walmart and the price then: $59.99. It saddens me that they are now selling the watch for so much since it was A: in a movie and B: no longer in production. Supply and demand I suppose. The T56381 is the exact same watch body with the exact same features but only costs around $50 so if you like the black face and black resin band a little better I highly recommend you go with that model instead. Yes I agree that the watch is a bit heavy but I have had mine for 4 or five years now and it is a very durable watch. Just like the title says it's a great watch but a horrible price.
5,Great Watch,"How can you go wrong for 50 bucks? Does what it says. For the life of me, couldn't figure out how to take links out of the band. Had to go to a jeweler to get that done. Looks nice. Dressy. Get it"
2,No blue light!,"Hello!Well I bought this watch because of the movie.If your are looking for that, don't go for it.I expected just the blue light and better definition characters, not the traditional 7-led numbers/leters.It's a little heavy.But it'a good watch. Just not what I expected.Good color."
4,IronMan Triathlon,"Verry good product, sturdy construction, 2 problems : heavy weight (approx 2 time a regular IronMan) and their new Timer is now a 3 loop possibility, allowing you to count down for example 20 min than shift to a 10 min and than 15 min and back again to 20 and so on... funny, but no easy reset, you have to reprogram every time.At least verry good looking, you car turn off the digital display for a slic looking suit and tie dress, and turn them on later for your activity."
3,Analog Problems,"It's a very nice watch, a bit heavy.The problem I'm having with mine is the analog hands are losing time - it seems to be about 5 minutes every 24 hours. Not sure if it's just this one, or a problem with all this model?"
4,Great value and features for the multi-time zone traveler,"I have worn dual display Timex watches for many years. Since I travel on business across time zones often, the feature of having the analog display always on the ""home"" time and the digital display adjusted to the ""local"" time has been great. This watch takes that to a higher level with dual alarms as well tied to the different zones. I was concerned it might be too complex but have found the interface very intuitive. It is also great looking and a great value. Since I have been wearing more athletic looking versions previously I was also concerned that this might be too bulky and heavy. At first, it did feel quite heavy in your hand but other than taking it off when I play tennis, I have found it very comfortable to wear."
2,Frail,"One word to describe this watch: frail. When I first purchased it, the band broke. Timex replaced the entire unit under warranty - but at my cost for S/H. Two years after purchase, the analog hands are frozen and the digital face keeps resetting itself every few hours. I've been refunded by the extended warranty through my credit card company. I won't buy another one of these, and I won't by another Timex. Two stars because it sure looked nice when it did work - even if it didn't keep time well at all."
5,Classy yet sporty,Looks great in both digital and analog features. You can adjust it by turning on or off the digital feature. A great watch for the price you pay! The design itself blends in with other top watch brands!
1,Disappointed with this watch,"My previous watch was an Ironman Analog / Digital watch with a metal band. I really wanted to like the Ironman Triathlon 42 Lap Combo Dual Tech Watch #T56371 but it has some major flaws:- The Analog clock runs faster than the Digital clock requiring one to sync the two clocks only a week.- Since the analog hands are so wide and the digital numbers so big there is rarely a time when some digital information is not hidden by a hand.- There are no Hour markings on the face of the watch but only six subtle marking on the rim of the watch, this makes reading the analog time difficult.- The metal band is easily scratched.- There is no Hour Chime option.- The battery life is poor.- The watch is too heavy for a sport watch."
3,What time is it?,"Watch is heftier than other Iron Man watches - and can easily pass as dress watch. The real weakness is the hands on the analog watch actually do block you from reading the digital numbers. Others made that comment before I bought it and I thought ""Oh, come on. Big deal."" For some reason, though, when I look at the watch with digital and analog time showing, I end up looking at the numbers, not the hands. You can turn the digital display off, though."
3,"I loved this watch, but....","I saw this watch and loved it. It looks great and feels even better. It a good match - perfect for the Boardroom and you can lift in it after work. However, the thing is a battery killer! I could rarely keep the analog part (which uses more energy) from running. It would stop, while the digital part would keep working. That kind of annoyed me. So, I sold it and got a pure digital Ironman with a metal band. It's better is all respects other than looks - it just doesn't look as good as this watch does."
1,Analog hands broke,"I also have this watch, and the analog hands broke immediately after the warranty expired. I love/hate my watch...the styling is still great from the movie; but the analog part breaking is bewildering to me. Timex has a reputation for tough products, but this watch falls far short of that. I also tried to replace the battery first, hoping that would resolve problem, but no luck. It wasn't a big investment($10), but DON'T waste your ten if you bought/given this watch. I hope that TIMEX will see these feedbacks and correct this problem for future buyers."
1,Band Broke...No Replacement,"The band on this watch broke within 6 months. I have searched for another band, but Timex makes this in such a way that you have to buy a whole new watch to get the band. I noticed, while researching, that another person got stuck with this trick also. I feel so disgusted looking at this watch that I want to just throw it in the trash now. It still looks like brand new, but the little flimsy clasp with the Ironman symbol on it (right where it clips onto the watch) separated. The next time I bought a man's watch, I spent triple the money (NOT ON A TIMEX) and that watch is doing great. If Timex keeps pulling this trick, I'll never buy another Timex watch as long as I live...I'll do my research before buying next time IF I ever decide to buy another Timex."
2,Not impressed,"After watching the movie, Stranger Than Fiction, I knew that I had to have this watch. However, I was rather disappointed when I received it. The biggest disappointment was how heavy it was. Another disappointment was how complicated it was to operate it. Lastly, it was inconvenient trying to adjust it fit my wrist. So, I returned this watch fairly quickly."
1,"You'd think that after six editions, the book will be good","All the students in my calculus class AS WELL AS THE PROFESSOR agree that this book is a terrible choice for learning calculus I or calculus II. The explanations for concept are horrendously written. I would recommend a book such as ""Calculus, Concepts and Applications"" by Paul Forrester for anyone wanting to learn basic calculus."
1,if you see a hand sticking out of this grave whack it with a shovel,"""Yells From The Crypt"" is a shameless attempt by Gravewax Records to make money by marketing largely sub-standard material as a concept: horror rock 'n roll.Most of these people can barely play their instruments. The words, when intellgible, are idiotic. Production values, with few exceptions, are non-existent. Obviously nearly all of these tracks are demos made in ill-equipped home studios.There are two decent instrumentals in the Dick Dale vein: Track 3 ""Murder On Beaver Street"" and Track 6 ""Psychonaut."" ""Psychonaut"" by The Coffin Daggers could hold its own in any surf anthology. The rest of this CD is garbage. Screamin' Jay Hawkins did all of this with a lot more talent and competent musicians.Download MP3s of Tracks 3 and 6. Hopefully Gravewax Records is bio-degradable."
5,Powerhouse of a bread knife,"This is definitely the sturdiest, sharpest bread knife I've ever owned. The blade is completely rigid, no bending ever. The blade is super sharp, easily cutting through bread or whatever else I put it up against. Makes me wonder how I went so long with my old bread knife."
1,"Crumbs everywhere, smashed bread slices","I got tired of cutting my Italian bread loaves with our steak knives and having crumbs all over the cutting board. So I got this bread knife as a gift from my husband. We couldn't wait to use it.Well we were so disappointed. The blade is very thick and the edges of the knife don't cut easily. We use it on Italian loaves as I mentioned, and you have to push down even harder than we used to with the bread knives, thereby smashing the loaf. And the cutting edge leaves tons of crumbs which means it's not cutting smoothly through the crust.I would prefer a finer serated edge to cut easier through the Italian bread."
3,Bread Knife/Saw,"Not a bad value for what it cost. It saws, rather than cuts bread. I'm spoiled by my Shun slicer!"
1,Tears more than cuts,"I got one of these a few years back, with a set, and it was OK. Eventually I upgraded to another Henckels knife. That eventually wore out and I decided to try one of these again. Mistake.This knife is unsuitable for any bread. Crusty bread it slides off the side unless you are very careful (which you quickly learn to be, if just to save your fingers). Other bread it kind of cuts, kind of tears.Unacceptable."
5,Like a knife thru butter,"My wife has been on a kick lately making home made bread . We ve got knives of all types and variety's but didn't actually have the bread knife in our collection . So slicing bread was sometimes a bit tedious but not any longer ! This baby goes through fresh bread like a champ . Again , this particular style JA knife uses a serrated edged blade and yes I know they're not ideal for somethings and so on but I assure you , this bread knife , serrated edge and all goes thru our bread just fine with out crushing or chunking it all to pieces . So if your like us and want / wanted a complete set of matching knives and need that super bread slicing machine then this is what you've been looking for . Thanks"
4,Free with set,This knife came free with the carving set I bought. Nice knife that matches the carving set. Wish it was longer to I can use my plastic holder to slice home made bread. Works well when using for bagels and free hand bread slicing.
1,Does not live up to the Henckels quality,Very poor quality. Looks and feels like a $5 knife from Wal-Mart. I returned it.
4,"tasty,","Cracker is good, flavorful and sturdy. Tastes good with most any topping or plain. I have enjoyed all the products from this manufacturer. These were well packaged, I wish there were more per box. Good thing I got six boxes."
3,Middling at best,"Thought I'd give these a try. They are rather soft and have a distinct ""flour"" taste and not much else. Overpriced compared to other brands. If you're into trying crackers, I recommend you try something else."
5,Great Reference Book,"Im 16 years old and interested in being a doctor. This book has a lot of information ranging from an atlas of the body to what to do in certain emergencies. But the main part of the book is an alphabetized index that explains in detail things from bee stings, to pneumonia, to back pain. It shows conventional methods along with alternative methods like acupressure and herbal remedies. This is a great book to have around the house and doesn't cost as much as some medical books do."
1,Disaster!!!,the seller sold a false kit. The lens are not 100% compatible with this camera (only manual focus). They refunded a lower price than the market for the lens. I fill swindled.
5,Abhi,Most comprehensive review of the subject from a trading/ hedging practioners point of view. This has just the right amount of detail. I would not recommend this book to those who are looking for a more mathematical treatment of the subject.
4,help for baby boomer aging eyes,"This larger type really helps with the eye strain so common in baby boomers like myself. Though larger than my previous Bible, this edition is still a very commom sized Bible and very comfortable to use. The center reference column is common and helpful, as is the concordance. However, this Bible has a new feature to me, the Quick Find. This topical type of index can be very helpful when looking for a particular topic or that scripture you know is somewhere, you just can't remember where! For the price, the binding and cover are nicely done and the gilt edged pages add to the appearance. If you are looking for a more comfortable and less frustrating experience visually while reading the Bible this one is for you."
5,excellent knives,great quality knives (comparable to more expensive brands) for an affordable price. I have a similar set that I received as a wedding gift 5 years ago...they're still in great shape and sharp! Bought this set as a Christmas gift for a friend who loves them.
1,Rusted and lost edge quickly,"It says in the description that they won't rust - well, mine did after seven months :( The edges also began losing sharpness after about three months.For this amount of money, there are better choices. Avoid."
4,The first guide of the Arizona Trail is a tool for hikers.,Covering the Arizona Trail from border to border this book accomplishes the goal. Due to the overwhelming area covered the trail descriptions are brief. Excellent additional information is included. How to get along with the wildlife and trail etiquette is included. Job well done.
3,Interesting experiences. Ridiculous politics.,"Writing a review about 3 years after reading it. Spent time with the author's crowd and even talked to him a little.Good things: fun stories with a loose flowing conversational feel, and achieves some superficial excitement. I learned a few things in here that saved my life when broke.Bad things: for every authentic experience there's a pseudo-rebellious observation that sounds like it comes from the worst mooch of a roommate you could ever imagine. You know the kind- rants against the man, sob stories when the rent's due, and won't do the dishes. The book sounds like it's trying really hard to justify something that's pretty lame."
2,Mental Chains,"While the author shook off the chains the wage-slavery society, he is much less proficent in shaking off the chains of the ideas he has about himself. The author seems to suffer from a cult of his own personality, which makes the book less about freedom and more about him defining himself. I am sorry to say that this is not ""revolutionary"", but quite ordinary. Having travelled and lived in India, I have seen true renounciates...of both body and mind. One star is in recognition of the courage required to live that way, and the second is in recognition that in order to live that way in a society such as ours, maybe a strong self-image/arrogance is needed. WHAT A PROFOUND MEASAGE IT WOULD BE IF IT WASN'T!"
1,Avoid this garbage,"I read another book published by this company, and that was great. However, this book is terrible. Honestly, the worst book I've ever read. I actually had to stop reading it halfway through, something I VERY rarely do. The author is a complete moron. There is nothing revolutionary about this book or the author."
1,Unreadable small print,"The ""look inside"" feature on Amazon showed nice readable print, so I was disappointed when the ""real"" book came and the print was so tiny I couldn't manage it. Had to return the book for a refund, for which I still wait."
4,Jewish Bible,"I've heard of this book for some time and wanted to check it out/add to my Bible library. Haven't had a lot of chance to check it out yet, but looks good."
1,A bad translation,"JPS has taken every opportunity to rewrite messianic passages despite the command in Devarim not to augment or diminish G-d's written Torah! Most places where the translators varied significantly from other well known translations it is noted in the footnotes, but where this translation differs from that of the Septuagint in passages commonly applied to Yeshua they fail to give notice of the variance. May HaShem have mercy!"
2,Kindle Footnotes at end of chapters.,"The main problem I have with the Kindle Ed. is that when you touch on the footnote to the text it takes you to the end of the chapter. Then, to resume reading the text there is no shortcut to return to the place where you left off. You have to leaf back through the pages manually to get back to were you were. One would think that there might be a way to touch the footnote to return to your place. Otherwise, put the footnotes at the foot of the page in which the text is printed."
3,Black is white,"Although it came it a black box, the book cover inside was white. Not worth the hassle to return, however."
4,Tanakh,"i ordered this book on accident, however when i got home with it and started to read it, I actually liked it. It is very easy to understand."
3,Rate based ion editing not religious content,"Amazon and Kindle, please make sure your digital books have been properly edited. Case in point in this version of the Tanakh; There are ten cases where the word 'cat' is used in lieu of 'eat' and two instances where 'eves' is used instead of 'eyes' and 3 instances of 'diat' instead of 'that.'It is not enough to scan these books. Someone needs to edit them, too."
4,"Enjoyable, easy read.","I ordered this book because I wanted tor read the Scriptures that Messiah Yeshua had available when He walked this earth. I really enjoy the poetry style of much of the writings. The only downer is the small font size used, it doesn't work too well with older eyes ;-) but with the brightness of the white pages, it works!"
3,Get the Giant Print edition if there is one.,"Great translation destroyed by 7 or 8 point font. If your bifocals are that strong or you like using a magifying glass to read, OK."
3,small print - paperback,"I purchased the paperback version from Amazon. The paperback version has print almost too small to read. Good for reference only, not for general reading. The hardbound version has nice sized print and is wonderful. The e-book is terrific and I am enjoying it."
1,Riddled with typos,"I was pretty shocked at the amount of typos throughout, some which were actually funny at times, others made me cringe. I was sent an unsolicited offer by Amazon acknowledging the errors & offering a new download which would replace the one I had. After agreeing & getting the replacement, the new one was missing most of the navigational hot-links. That means, if I wanted to go to the last chapters of Judges, I had to flip through from chapter one. Worse, if I hit a hot-link for one of the foot-notes, the return hot-link was missing, so, I had to flip back. From an ease of navigation POV, the first version riddled with typos was better. After speaking w/Amazon customer-service, they gave me a refund, so no problems there, but if I want a JPS Tanakh, I was told I have to repurchase from the Amazon website, which is still sending people the copies with typos. How absurd is that? My advice is NOT to buy this item until they get their act together."
3,A good starter but not the definitive...,"I found this book very enlightening on most major points. Being of a Jewish heritage, some of the points don't sit exactly right though. Non-Jews may miss some of the subtle but extremely important points (ref. ""echad"", the hebrew word for ""one"" being translated as ""alone"" in Deut 6). The captions at the bottom of the pages are helpful in pointing out where the authors took liberty though. A good tool for discussion but not the definitive answer."
1,"No Hebrew, No Commentary Is for Reform Jews and Christians.","Don't buy this book unless are a reform Jew, this JPS Jewish bible has lots of error and translations are not the same as in Hebrew, and no commentary. Is meant for reform Jews, J4J, and christians. Do your self a favor and get the Art Scroll edition which has Hebrew, English and commentary."
4,The JPS Tanakh,This is an easy to read Tanakh in plain English. I was happy to learn that this Tanakh is also available in audio format on jewishpub.org. To my understanding this Tanakh is not quite orthodox but very close.
5,A super book.,"Large letters, thick paper, strongly bound. A good choice.There is very little referance or commentary and plenty of room to write notes.All the books and chapters are in the traditional order.Plus, the hardcover allows you to have your name inscribed on the front.This is the Bible you want, no doubt."
2,Table of contents not that active,"While I can't complain too much about something that only costs 99 cents, I was disappointed in the ""active table of contents."" Yes, one can click on ""Psalms"" and go directly to that chapter, but that's the extent of the ""activity."" If I want to read Psalm 148, I have to scroll through the previous 147 psalms to get to it. With some of the shorter prophetic books, that's not too bad, but with anything more than a few pages long, it is a nuisance. I suppose I could go through the whole thing and set individual bookmarks, but that seems like too much work. The King James version with active table of contents works much better, but it is a dated Christian translation."
2,Missing Stuff and a little Christian Biased,"[...]NIV Church Bible, Large Print [Large Print, Deluxe Edition] [Hardcover]For easy to read text I recommend getting that Bible instead because the JPS old testament is missing certain verses or has improperly translated verses like in psalm 2:12 as if JPS is a little Christian biased.psalm 2:12NIVKiss the Son, lest he be angry and you be destroyed in your way, for his wrath can flare up in a moment. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.psalm 2:12JPSpay homage in good faith, lest He be angered, and your way be doomed in a mere flash of His anger. Happy are all who take refuge in Him"
5,Tanakh,"I have this book already, I bought it as a gift for my sunday school assistant who is gradutating High school. I think she will enjoy it!"
1,This Is Not Leather Bound !,"Great book, but Amazon have made a serious mistake in the description. They say it is ""Leather Bound"". It is most definitely NOT leather bound. It is leatherette, which is not leather. Leatherette is fake leather made from some kind of plastic. Don't be fooled. IT IS NOT LEATHER BOUND. I bought one and was very disappointed. I told Amazon, but they didn't want to know and I see they are still advertising it as leather when it is not."
1,No Hebrew,I want this book for the Hebrew text and requested a sample to see just how the Hebrew characters would look. But judging by the sample there is no Hebrew text as advertised. except for a few names and titles all I see is English translation and introduction to the translation. When will there be a Kindle Hebrew text of the Tanakh.
1,disappointed,"On the web, the book looked like a reasonable quality book. Instead the print is way too small and the lay out very odd for a bible. Besides I thought it to be a hard cover, something rarely mentioned on Amazon"
3,Tanakh: The Holy Scriptures,Tanakh of the Holy Scriptures in a new paperback translation is a very helpful reference when comparing with Christian translations.
3,The Jewish Bible: Tanakh: The Holy Scriptures,"This Bible is smaller than I had thought it was. I did not realize it was so small, however it is easy to read and it arrived on time but it was not in good condition for being new. It was smashed on one corner and the pages were folded backwards onto the cover of the book."
4,The font's too small!,"The 10-point font is a little too small for my old eyes. Next time, please use a 12-point!"
3,Take care,"This is not a full sized book and it's made from that onion-skin type biblical paper...and the covers are VERY weak cardstock. The book bows when I pick it up. I'm very unhappy. Had I known this about this particular edition I'd have gotten the hardbound one. This book is a keeper, meant to be read and dog earred etc...but I don't know that this one will be able to stand up to such use. I'm in the process of trying to reinforce and laminate the covers so at least they will be more sturdy. If this book is not that important to you, then it will be OK. But if you mean to use this book a lot, pay the extra for the better quality book. I wish I had."
5,Fantastic,Renato Zero is an accomplised musician. With his latest release he has once again proven he still has what it takes to make great music. Great Music!
5,Get out the pedestal.,"A few reasons that this book is worshipped by many of its readers, including me.1. It's the quintessential story of friendship. Many, many sets of good friends over the years have called themselves musketeers, and this novel is why. The four main characters have unforgettable but distinct personalities.2. No one had ever written action-adventure the way Alexandre Dumas did.3. Very witty dialogue. Each character has his own brand of humor, making this book even more fun than it otherwise would be.4. Very evocative of the time period in which it is set.READ THIS BOOK! I reccomend it to anyone."
5,Honor Regained and Love Lost,"The only impressions I had about the novel were from the parodies that Hollywood had created. No sooner had I read the first chapter than I had fallen in love with not only Dumas's style but with D'Artagnan as well. This tragic yet action filled novel is a page turner. Once you begin reading you can't stop. The honor of the queen is at stake and the only one left to help is the young rapscallion D'Artagnan. In a tale of himself and his three witty friends, Aramis, Athos, and Porthos, they embark on an adventure to return honor to the queen and shame upon the cardinal. Yet to succeed the four friends must avoid the plots and schemes of Rochefort and Milady, the cardinals esteemed colleagues. The end is a tale of love lost, honor gained, and friendships forged. The Three Musketeers is truly a tale that cannot be passed up."
4,A must have.,This is a must have for all lovers of animation. Norstein has the ability to create a magical world and it all comes from within. I can only say that seeing is believing.
2,Beware of problems with Outlook email!,"I purchased this product after reading a lot of Amazon review and thought this was going to be easy to set up and troubleshoot. Well to Linksys's credit I had no problems hooking the router to my DSL model and my 2 computers (1 desktop and 1 laptop). Even my internet connection works great and setting up everything took very little time. But I've been having nothing but PROBLEMS with email!. There is a whole lot of trouble getting and sending mail. Calling Linksys and getting someone to help you is literally impossible. Even after they call you back after 4 days (yes, 4 days) their tech support agents are quite incompetent.Most DSL providers do not support a DSL router, so you are stuck. I am still trying to fix my email and its over a month since I bought this product. I would suggest that you check out other products (esp. how good their tech. support is) before purchasing Linksys."
5,Excellent!,"This has to be the easiest piece of hardware I ever set up. Out of the box, plug it in, plug your cables in and you're running. Less than 10 minutes and I was sharing my internet connection on two computers. Wouldn't have even taken that long if I didn't go through the motions of configuration to make sure everything was set up correctly.For people who know what they are doing, geekwise, it makes life easy. For people who know nothing or little, it's even simpler."
1,Nice blue paper wight,"The router's firmware corupted after two weeks of use. I bought it for [$$$] and found the firewall features not worth the money. When the firmware corrupted, linksys tech support said a lot of ummms and ahhhs and told me to take it back. My cat provided better support and seemed to have a higher technical background. I bought a D-link router that came with a print server for [$$] 60 bucks. It doesn't have a switch but for my uses I don't need one. My friend bought a linksys router and has returned his as the firmware corrupted shortly after he bought it. Buy a D-Link and buy a four port switch and you will be way better off than buying this cheesey little router. :)"
1,Bad quality for long run use. Tech support phone is busy...,"There was no problem in its installation, and I was enjoying the net surfing for 4 months. Suddenly it drops the connection to DSL modem (SBC pac-bell is a provider), and I have to give it a cool down. It works next two days, but it drops again..., Their support line is always busy. I will buy another router from Netgear."
2,Would not work -- Lousy customer support,"I bought this item from a local electronics store and read the installation instructions carefully. I physically installed the item but could only get one machine on my network to use the device at a time -- the one that booted up first. A re-reading of the manual did not give a clue to what was wrong. During two intensely frustrating calls to customer technical support I spoke with arrogant and stupid people who were of no help. I was fortunately able to return the item without a loss.I subsequently bought a Netgear RP114. There were problems but the technical support people (based in India) were wonderful. The problem had nothing to do with the device -- all about firewalls, etc. but they gave me lots of things to look at and finally recommended that I look for a firewall, etc. that might be mucking up the works. Since I cleared the obstructions I (and my family) have been thoroughly enjoying shared broad-band connection to the internet."
5,Flawless Installation,"Absolutely no difficulty installing the unit for DSLservice. One hint: If you are not experienced with wiring Class 5cable (I was not), visit the linksys website for instructions and wiring diagrams. You might save yourself time and frustration. Good luck!"
4,DSL Router great... Documentation/Tech support not so great,I would have given this product 5 stars if not for lack of documentation or call-back techsupport or email support only. I had a basic question that could have been answered within seconds but had to wait over 24hrs for a call back for resolution.The Router itself has worked flawlessly on my home network. Terrific product for online gaming. The only thing I would have liked to see is the ability to setup more than one machine in the DMZ.
2,Good while it lasts,"I've had the Linksys for about 14 months for the home office network (cable modem, two computers). Over that time I've had a few performance problems. But I always assumed it was our service provider. Half the time when I'd call, they claimed there was nothing wrong on their end (I never believed them). Recently problems began increasing rapidly. I started looking at the Linksys and it turns out that it was going bad...fast. A web chat with Linksys tech support took 21 minutes with no reply to my questions beyond a 'Hello, how can I help you'. So now I have a D-link and everything is humming along just fine. If you're having intermittant connection problems, don't forget to test the router, especially if it's a Linksys!"
1,OK for Cable not for SNET DSL,"I cannnot get router to work with SNET DSL. Linksys NEVER NEVER EVER answers the phone. If I ever have to buy a DSL router again, I will buy something else."
2,MSN Messenger problems,"Don't buy this router if you use MSN Messenger. The router will not allow voice/video conversations. Linksys support has been responsive assures me the router supports Messenger, but their instructions are extremely complex and so far (two weeks) I havn't been able to implement them. It's a pain unplugging the router and reconfiguring the network connections every time you need to make a call."
1,My network,I have been unable to make it work for my intended use. I have several computers and a HP Laserjet4 (13 years old and functions perfectly) I am hooked to my ISP's shared T1 with a wireless connection. I had intended to be able to use all my computers on net and use the one printer for all. If it works I can't get it to work.
1,CAUTION TO ALL VERIZON ONLINE DSL USERS,i bought this router a week ago and i tried to install it and when i got to a certain step i couldnt get online so after a week of spending hours on the phone no one could fix the problem so today i got a new modem and now my internet access works. yes thats right the router fried my modem i do not advise you to get this router
2,"GOOD PRICE, BUT NOTHING STANDS BEHIND IT.","I BOUGHT THIS ROUTER TO NETWORK MY HOME OFFICE GOT THE WAN LINK LIGHT TO COME ON BUT IT COULD NEVER LOCATE MY ROUTER, AFTER NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS AND RESETTINGS, I CALLED THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT LINE WHICH (SUPPOSE TO BE) OPENED 24 HOURS 7 DAYS A WEEK GOT A RECORDING OUR OFFICE IS CLOSED TODAY PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE AND SOMEONE WILL GET BACK TO YOU. I WENT THROUGH THIS FOR TWO DAYS. I FINALLY GOT A TECH. HE DIDN'T SOUND TOO INTERESTED IN HELPING ME, HE COULD NOT GET THE SYSTEM TO OPERATE EITHER. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE STORE PICKED UP A SIEMEN SPEEDSTREAM 4 PORT DSL ROUTER TOOK NO MORE THAN 30 MINUTES TO SET UP NOW MY MACHINES ARE RUNNING FINE.THE ROUTER MAY BE A GOOD ROUTER BUT THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT TEAM REALLY [stinks]"
1,Somehow managed to CRASH,"Works fine for a few minutes, but fails right after. It just crashes and doesn't do anything. Don't buy this."
1,Not Mac Compatible,I sne this one back as it is not Copatible with Mac OS. I called and they said they had no need to offer Mac compatibility. A refreshing candor but a loss of a sale.
1,Don't buy from Linksys,"Had a bad router (arrived bad). Spent over a week and countless hours with tech support trying to get device replaced. Linksys has the worst tech support and support infrastructure I have ever dealt with. No one there is knowledgeable about the products they sell. No one at Linksys seems to care about their customers. I had to wait over a week after we determined that the device was bad before anyone would contact me on getting a new device sent out. Linksys is no good, buy a Netgear product instead."
1,Terrible product.,"I have had this thing since it first appeared on the market and have applied all of its firmware upgrades. It is horrible. When playing multiplayer games it often locks up, requiring it to be unplugged before any networking can take place again, it corrupts data within the LAN...the list goes on. LinkSys tech support is also atrocious, placing me on hold for over an hour several times and refusing to respond to e-mails. DO NOT BUY THIS"
1,Router O' Piece of Crap,"This router worked for one day on a pc with Windows 2000. Tried to hook up a pc and a mac (OS X) to it.Rumor has that it can be done, but Linksys doesn't support their products hooked up to a mac, so don't expect any advice. If you want to do this do not buy this, get an Asante router. We had nothing but problems and in the end I couldn't hook it back up to my computer(pc)and get on line. Stay away from this router!"
2,Buy elsewhere,"exchanged two already and both were defects......they made a high pitched noise which it is not suppose to do....check around the web and you will read other complaints about this issue.....I repeat it is not suppose to make a high pitched hum and if it does then it is a defect...i exchanged two already and both had the same problem except the first one i had made a lower pithced noise than the second...i wish i would had just kept the first....other than that though it does work good......to bad the sound is so annoying though....I had my computer, tv, and an air conditioner on and i could still hear this thing humming......and no its not interference cause i've tried plugging it in elsewhere"
5,Great Linksys product as always!,"This router was the first router I used to network two computers. Works great, and the added ability to update its firmware is great for it to catch up with expanding technology. Since it is only for wired networking, I bought the wireless Linksys router several months later. However, I still use the BEFSR41 wired router for LAN parties. It's so easy to setup it's practically idiot-free. You plug in your cables and you're good to go. Make sure you got enough CAT5 cables though.Even though this router is very simple to set up and use, its features are so many that it could make any IT techy happy. I've had this router for about a year now, and I've never ever had any problems with it. Great job Linksys!"
5,Works Great,"I just got this router and it works great. Hooking it up and installation was a cinch and I have no problems whatsoever. I only use it for my PC, PS2, and my Xbox but everything works fine. I can play Madden online while my brother plays the Xbox online and my wife shops on the internet with the PC at the same time. It's great. I truly recomend it for you gamers out there who tired of hooking and unhooking your cable modem to and from your PS2's and Xbox's. Also the price can't be beat! GET IT NOW!!"
3,"Easy to use, but has problems with ssh","I'm generally pretty happy with this product, but ultimately I had to replace it with a Netgear FR114P because of intermittant SSH/SCP problems. If you don't use SSH, you'll probably be pretty happy with this."
2,No longevity,"this router is attractive due to its feature set and low price.. however the quality is lacking, and the consensus seems that the router will die on you sometime after 1 year, if not sooner.. mine has just died after 1 1/2 yearsbtw the way it ""died"" is that 2 or 3 of the LAN ports don't work properly anymore, and the WAN port seems dead too, as the router will reset randomly during file transferit was great while it lasted, but I can't recommend it because of the short life span"
5,A great product for anyone who wants to share access,".I purchased this unit after considering a number of software/cpu combinations that were either too expensive or way too complicated. The Linksys router does it all for about $150.Now we can have all six computers in our home sharing internet access. The only glitch (not Linksys's) was with the @home service. The network identification system seems to vary from region to region (I have a fixed IP from Comcast). I simply had to put in the ID and @home domains, then choose automatic IP and zoom, I was on. I had to call Linksys to get this information, they called me back the next day with answer.Overall, it is the simple and ideal solution for sharing dsl or cable access. In fact, for some reason, access is faster through the router. Go figure."
4,Great out of the box small network config.,"I installed this product 2 months ago connected to a Bellatlantic DSL modem. Out of the box it needed a firmware upgrade to connect to Bellatlantic but once that was done the config was a piece of cake. I filled out my DSL login info, took most of the other defaults and connected the box to a newly installed home LAN. Only problem is every couple of days the connection status must be dropped then reconnected but this is only a problem if no one uses the LAN for a long time."
1,worthless pos,"After talking to their tech from India it was determinded to be defective and I was told to return it to Amazon.com for a refund,But instead I am going to send it to Linksys in peices very little peices maybe they can recycle it...Tin cans and a string would work better."
2,POOR Customer Service,"Linksys products have been degrading in quality over some time. This product is no exception. I have had to RMA several of these items over the last year. Linksys support is outsourced, meaning poor communication. Also, the support department is no longer about providing support, but will instead try to throw roadblocks in your path to keep you from replacing your defective product. Expect several calls and at least a week to replace a defective product through Linksys if you have never had to run their gauntlet before."
1,"Avoid tech support hell, do NOT buy this!!","I recently bought this product, tried to install using installation CD, which locked up on the 9th step. Called tech support, was told the product, which was bought that day, was no longer under warranty as Lynksys bases warranty on production date, not date of purchase,(i'm not making this up!) so warranty expired while on Staples shelf. ""Manilla Mary"" told they would believe me this one time and give me a one time complimentary tech support session. Declined and went and exchanged for another of the same model, which had 9 months remaining on the one year warranty, spent 9 (yes, 9, i'm not joking) hours with ""Rangoon Randy"" ""Phillipine Phil"" etc over three nights only to find they are clueless on setting this up. I still don't have a functioning router and don't know what the answer is but Lynksys most DEFINITLY isn't it."
3,"Works well, but not for long","I've had this router for about 2 years, and it worked great for the first year. Very easy to use web based interface for basic setup and for more advanced configuration. However, after about a year port 3 stopped working. This also happened to me with another Lynksys product (4 port hub), that I had bought previously, and was being used at my parents house until two of the ports went bad.If you want a product that will last more than a year or two, I recommend spending a little extra money and getting a different brand."
4,Great Product,"Very happy with this product, but am disappointed with the DMZ feature, it doesn't seem to work as I understood from the reviews. (DMZ is demilitarized zone which opens up a connected computer ""live"" to the internet for apps such as NetMeeting)"
1,This product is not WORKING with dialpad,I am so disappointed about this router. Everything is OK except it is not work with dialpad. I had to return this product.Should not buy this one it is a hassel to return.
2,"Cool product, Lousy support","This is a *very* cool unit, but good luck if you need any technical support. My Linksys arrived from Amazon yesterday, and although the simple things were easy to configure, I have a slightly more complicated question for technical support. I spent 20 minutes on hold on day-1, with my call answered by an ""operator"". No call back, so I tried again on day-2. 2.5 *HOURS* on hold, then finally another ""operator"", who promised a priority response. 7 hours later I tried again, with a promise for a call back within 30 minutes. Guess what, it's been another 2 hours. Apparently the big sticker on the box which advertises ""24x7 Support!"" is the amount of time it takes to get a human."
5,Linksys has a winner,This family of products work great. If you have Cable or DSL you want one of these. In our group more than 20 people have bought these with great results. Consumer friendly is the key. This replaced many complex setups in windows and my layered firewall software. Now my computer is back to being a computer and my network does all the net work.
1,If you host on line games AVOID THIS PRODUCT,This router is buggy and drops players. It is unusable if you like hosting online games. Linksys knows of the problem but has been unsuccessful in resolving the issue. I ended up buying an SMC Barricade which works flawlessly. My Linksys made for one expensive paperweight. There are lots of DSL router choices out there. Don't choose this one!!
5,Rock Solid,"If you're here, you know what this is, and what it should do.It does it. So there you have it.I was going to use this thing as a stopgap, and eventually set my linux box up as a dhcp server, but this thing's so simple, and since it allows you to route requests on a by-port or global basis to particular 192.168 addresses, I haven't bothered. It's great, cheap, and while i think that i might have gotten the wireless version had i had a bit more loot, it's been very good to me."
4,Works great,"Followed instructions and it worked the first time with my home using XP and my work computer using NT. No conflicts, no problems. Should be shipped with a patch cable but that is minor. Two computers up and running in fifteen minutes. I have been using it for over one month with no problems."
5,Easy to set up,"I am a novice when it comes to computers. When I wanted to link both of my PC's to a cable modem I was a little worried that I would screw things up. This thing was so easy all I had to do was plug the thing in and hook the cables up. I still am having trouble getting 100mbps on the second computer but it may be the network card. If you have a cable modem, I wouldn't hesitate. Anything else... I'm not sure about."
5,Works with the Macintosh and Airport!,"This router works great. Very easy to set up and use. It works fine with the Macintosh connected to a cable modem via Airport. No problems! If you need to update the firmware, you can do so from the Mac. Just download TFTP, which is available: http://www.mactechnologies.com/pages/download.html."
5,Just what I needed.,"I had worked with one of these before.I needed a router for my new home, and started looking around. Once again I find myself with a Linksys.It is easy to administer, will handle logging in my DSL Modem (I am much happier with DSL then Cable) and has kept things running smoothly.Oh, and I could not beat the price."
3,Linksys EtherFast Cable/DSL Router with 4-Port 10/100 Switch (BEFSR41),"works well when you get it setup and going. instruction were poor, drivers were not microsoft digitaly signed. all in all does work well."
4,"Great value/performance, easy to configure.","As with most Linksys products, this product is a great buy. The easy-to-use web-based management system, convenient and stylish design, great performance, excellent security and good driver/bios update support, and Linksys's great customer service make this a good buy for users of any level.I've personally bought and installed 15 of these devices (some were the 8-port model, but the same product overall) for some of my clients who need VPN and firewall support for their private networks over their broadband connection. Remote management support also makes administering these a snap."
3,Worked great - for one year,"This worked perfectly until last week (one year later). Now I have 30% packet loss to the internet--but it comes in solid bursts (30-60 seconds at a time of no connectivity).I've tested all other parts of my network, and the linksys is the part that crapped out."
4,Complete DHCP Router/Switch,"The Linksys BEFSR41 Etherfast 4-Port Cable/DSL Router has everything you need for hooking up four PC's and one printer server.I used to hook up my Internet Cable Modem to my main PC thru network card (#1) and the second network card (#2) went to a Linksys 5-port hub. The hub connected to 3 other PC's.The only problem is that the Main PC had to stay on all the time. I also shared a printer connected thru this PC, which was on all the time.With the Linksys BEFSR41 Etherfast 4-Port Cable/DSL Router and the Linksys EPSX3 EtherFast 10/100 PrintServer3 (3-Port), I can hook it up to the network and any PC can use the printer server or the Internet connection. They are now all independent of one another.I setup each PC for DHCP mode and IPX/SPX Protocol, which can make the PC's visible faster.I have been running the new hookup for around a month now and have no problems."
1,Drops connections when used for PPPoE DSL connection,"Continuously dropped connection to my ISP. Customer support lacking, didn't receive a return call until several days later. Router is now a paper weight."
1,"Linksys Says They Do Not ""Support"" Macs","We purchased a Linksys Etherfast 10/100 Auto Sensing 8 Port Workgroup Hub and connected 5 Apple computers and all was fine. We purchased a new G-4 500 meg and it would not connect to the internet. After troubleshooting with our own tech and Mac techs, we bypassed the Linksys hub and connected that one computer to a switch. It worked fine. We tried everything to get this to work with the Linksys hub to no avail.We called Linksys and they basically ran us around for days telling us they would replace the unit. They never did. We finally got in touch with them for the third time and a ""senior"" tech said, ""We do not support Macs""."
3,Mac Non-support,"I bought this router because it showed Mac compatibility in the catalogs. I was terribly disappointed when I opened up the instruction manual and turned to the Mac section- there isn't any. I read further and found a statement from Linksys that says their router will function with other operating systems, but they offer NO TECHNICAL SUPPORT for SETUP, CONFIGURATION OR TROUBLESHOOTING ON NON-WINDOWS operating systems.I was preparing to return the router when I decided to look for Mac support on the Web. I found a few sites that gave instructions for the Mac. After a bit of fumbling and trial and error, I got the router to run. If was not thinking of changing from Macs to Windows based machines, I would have returned it.Having said that- since I got it configured, it has run flawlessly. No thanks to Linksys."
2,"Good product, Poor customer care","I have had my router about 1 1/2 years now. When I first got it I spent hours (not exaggerating) on the phone to Linksys Tech - first you listen to classical music over & over again - When you finally get to talk to someone, they try to get rid of you anyway possible - The only way you will get though to them, is if you call around 4AM - Then they tell you, they will have a senior Tech call you, but no one ever does. They finally got tired of hearing from me & told me, take it back to where I bought it - It will not work on your system. Their documentation stinks and their phone support is worthless. I found out, just by trial & error, if I turned off the modem, when programming the router, then turn the modem back on - everything works fine, but Linksys Tech Support was no help whatsoever."
3,PC Support Only,"The only thing wrong with this product, indeed anything this company makes, is that they do not provide any support for Macs. I fretted over the 70+ page instruction book and the 20 step ""quick start"" before calling the 24/7 tech support line, only to be told no help for me and my G4 PowerBook. However, a sales guy gave me a URL for a Mac site that did have some help, or so I assume as I have not actually gone to look. What I did, way too late at night, and with fingers crossed, was hook up the cable modem, an iMac, a cheap PC running Win98 that belongs to a buddy, and my PowerBook via Airport. Working from the Airport setup utility in OS X, instead of the Wintel box, the whole network came up in a blink. Indeed, all I had to enter was my password from a previous Airport setup in OS 9! Apple's built in code did the rest. 20 step ""quick start"" my patooty!!! So, if you have Airport, buy this product; if not you are on your own!"
2,Not the same quality product,"I've owned several of these routers for many years. I've upgraded and downgraded firmware trying to find something that was really solid and reliable. I've come to the conclusion this unit is good for a small, non-critical network, but it has reliability issues.Since Cisco took over Linksys, the long-term stability and reliability of their products has diminished in my opinion. This router works well, but it will occasionally freeze up for no reason and require a hard reset/power cycle to work again. Also this unit will sometimes reset and reload factory default information with no notice. If you change the default admin password you may find it reset back to the default. Sometimes it will just lock-out and you have to do a hard reset (pressing the reset button while powering up) to reload factory defaults. This router should not be used in any environment where it would be left unattended for long periods of time. It simply is not reliable in that capacity."
2,Reliability problems,"Setup easy, performance fine, but died in a few months. Same problem with BEFCMU10 Cable Modem. This seems more than just coincidence; previously used Linksys and they were good products. Now they are substandard from reliability standpoint. Am replacing all network products with Netgear; will not buy any further Linksys products."
1,Failure,I have purchased two of these routers and both have failed. One lasted 13 months and the other 7 months. They refused to stand behind either unit because I did not have the receipt but I had everything else. Don't waist your time and money with this one.
3,Forget video conferencing,Works well as a router once I figured out the proper on/off - reset -reboot sequence. The big disappointment is conferencing. Broadband internet access enables video conferencing -- which worked great before I added the router. It has some wierd settings that are supposed to make video possible but they haven't worked for me. So now I can route the DSL connection around the home network but not to do what I most wanted to do. Give me back my cable internet with multiple addresses and NO ROUTERS!
3,Not a good gaming platform,"I purchased the Linsys not really knowing anything about homenetworking or sharing a broadband connection. That was about a year ago. Since then I've become very knowledgeable on the subject. I've tested several Routers and just yesterday replaced my Linksys router with a SMC Barricade 4 port wireless router. The Linksys performed well if you are only interested in basic connectivity and ease of setup. However, it is not good for online gaming for the simple reason that it will randomly kick you off of various servers. Its transfer speeds are nothing to boast about, either. I've been using the SMC for only a few hours now, and I am already amazed at the difference in speed from the two routers. If you are looking for basic connectivity and ease of setup and use, then this is your model. But if you want value for your dollar, I suggest you look elsewhere. This is only a medicore router."
3,Mac users beware!,This router is fine if you are only running windows machines. However if you have a hybrid network stay far away from this product. The manual and linksys themselves are no help when it comes to setting up a macintosh for use with this router. It can be problematic to say the least.
1,Caution: Outdated product,"I purchased this router Oct, 2010. When I tried to install it, the installation disc would not run on my computer. I called the manufacturer (Linksys). The woman with customer service first told me it would be no problem to manually install the router and she would walk me through the process. Then she looked up the model and said because it was manufactured in 2006 it came with no warranty and no technical help. In order to install the router I was told I would need to pay $30 for their technical support. I declined and returned the router. It is an outdated product with no technical support. Just a guess but I suspect the disc will not run on my computer because the disc is outdated (or it was a defective disc). Linksys did not have a replacement disc. The seller of the product told me this router is no longer manufactured."
3,Didn't work for our Macs,"Probably a good product, I'd read good things, but it sure didn't work to hook up our 2 Mac computers. Went through a headache with tech support but in the end it just didn't support Mac. Returned it and got a D-Link instead which worked great from the get go and hasn't given us any problems since."
1,Needs to be rebooted every day,"This product sucks. We use many of them in the office, and all of them have the same problem. They work fine for a day, and then they stop. The fix is easy---you just need to unplug the power and plug it back in, but it's annoying, a pain in the rear, and a hassle."
1,Never buy this or anything from Linksys.,"I received the item, attempted to use it. It wouldn't work. I spent about 5 hours in online chat with Linksys, who had me reset the router twice. They are not clear. I finally reset the router, only to have it do the same thing a week later. I was told to reset the router again by the online chat Linksys people. I asked why a new router had stopped working after a week. They said the firmware might be corrupted and to update my firmware. At his point I decided that after 7 hours in online chat, I had wasted enough time with the product, and decided to return it."
5,VPN no problem. Works great.,"Responding to the earlier reviewer who said they had problems with VPN, perhaps their VPN software doesn't correspond to the IPSEC standard. I have no problem VPNing into work using both the Nortel and Symantec VPN clients, connecting to a Symantec VelociRaptor firewall on the other side -- works seamlessly every time. I've had nothing but positive experiences -- even with the advanced features -- during my past year of ownership. I plan on buying the wireless version eventually as well."
3,Excellent for Home Use... Horrible for Power Users,"For home use, this Linksys router is a lifesaver. It's quick, easy, and has extensive firewall controls. However, the ports are limited in speed for broadband sharing to 5 megabits per second. In network speeds, it can accomodate 100 megabits per computer. However, the cheap NAT processing software is horrible for hosting. For 3D games, the NAT processing unit produces strange graphics and lots of latency. I heard a few beta firmware upgrades can cure this problem, but I haven't tried any out yet since it's still a beta. If you host files or games, go with the Netgear RT314, if you surf and like to share broadband, go with the Linksys. Linksys has one of the best NIC's and PCMCIA cards, easy-to-use hubs, but their routers are a little shady."
5,Makes my cable modem more stable,"I love this product. It has all the fectures and more of software alternatives. ICS and Winproxy I found to a unstable alternatives. I have been using this product for 8 weeks and could not be happier. It is fast on thruput and can be customized. Do not bother with manual, upgrade firmware, read help files and online help for the correct info. I am a power user and love the control this product has."
3,Ok hardware bad support,"On the plus side... The price is great and it will get 4 computers to the internetFor a beginners, the on-line help is goodOn the down side...For IT Experts there is no support after ""where the cables go"". The support personnel @ linksys want to fix everything with ""please check your cables"" they are no help. The router will shut down if you use the default ""auto select"" on the Network card speed and it will disconnect of you try to force it at 100mips. At 10mips it works like a champ."
4,Great product,"Just a few little hints for people trying a home network with this router. I tried to set it up a network the first few times using all of the troubleshooting guides in the manual and on the cd. For some reason nothing was working. I forgot I needed to put the 'computer name' in the ""host name"" section of the router hookup. The only problem I came across while using the router is the firewall it has set up. There are ways to disable it but the manual and control panel are confusing for new users to networking. Other than that, it has saved me a lot of money for not paying for a second phone line for a computer on the second floor, and not paying the ISP for their monthly service."
4,Great Product,"I would recommend this product to anyone who has cable internetservice and wishes to connect to more than one machine. The hardware installation is very simple as there are illustratedinstructions included with the product. The software configuration is a little tricky and the documentation includedwas vague. There is an instruction CD included but again configuration of software was not very clear. Overall, once youget this baby configured and working you will be very pleased."
3,Working product; lousy manual,"The thing itself works fine, and is especially useful if you have ADSL (no need to ""login"" every time you want to establish a connection; it does it for you). A nice user interface when you get to it. However, the manual is completely indecipherable. If you are depending on it to help, you're out of luck. Also, it says *nothing* about MACs although of course the product works equally with MAC, IBM-clone or any other thing that has an Ethernet connection.Summary: buy it if you understand these things, or have a friend who does. Otherwise, buy something with a good manual."
5,Great First and Last Home Network or Small Business Router,"After Trying all the complicated gadgets and sharing tools available, I chanced upon this nifty little router. It is VERY VERY EASY to setup and use. Once setup your done, short of some act of god you will never have to mess with it again, i didnt. And if you need more than 4 ports?, No biggy this thing can handle up to 255 computers, just use a plain old hub and this little router will dish out the adress' all you do is plug in the cable's, use the the web page style interface to tell it how many computers you need adress' for and your done. It can do quite a bit more if you need more, but if you just want somthing that works ""Out of the Box"" this is your unit.Also Works fine with Everquest.Happy Networking,Rob Cannon"
5,VERY dependable,"I bought one of these BEFSR41 routers from Amazon in December, 2000 and it has been chugging away non-stop ever since.Originally, we had two computers hooked up to it, both running Windows98... now we have four on it; one with Win98, two with XP, and one with Vista... the router doesn't care - it just works - flawlessly. We have never done anything to it since we got it - it's probably the most trouble free electronic thing I have ever owned.I don't remember any details about configuring it, etc, (after all it was over six years ago) but anybody who can follow the instructions should have no trouble.It's a good deal!srs/mn"
5,Plug it in and go....,"I literally opened the box, plugged in the cat5 cables and was up and running within minutes. I am using VPN without problems. If you only get a single IP from your broadband provider (as is the case with Cox Cable), then this is a good selection."
4,Probably the one for you...,"I think it's safe to say that 90% of the people out there could buy this unit, plug it in, and be up and running instantly with the default configuration. From that respect, it's a good unit, nice interface, easy to set up, and reasonably reliable.If, on the other hand, you're part of the infamous ""other 10%"" who want to do some hosting, forward some ports, or run some fancy internet-based applications, you should probably move up to a professional-quality router. There are only a limited number of forwarding and triggering commands you can put in (which seems to be a limit of the interface, not necessarily of the hardware). The product also lacks a number of would-be-useful features such as blocking out hostile IP addresses, forwarding ports based on host header, remote access from outside of your local network, and any kind of reporting/status indicators that would assure you the firewall is in fact even working."
5,Linksys Scores Again!,"I am a Network Administrator of a school district (CNE, MCSE, CCNA) so I have a lot of experience with a variety of network components. When I decided to setup my home network I wanted the best I could get. After doing the usual research and having previous positive experiences with Linksys products I decided on this one and haven't regretted it for one minuite.I run Novell Netware 5.1 with FTP, HTTP, DNS, and DHCP servers setup on the system and it all runs together seamlessly with my Windows 2k Pro, Windows 98 SE, and MAC O/S 9 systems. I have never have to cycle the power, and even though I use PPPoE my connection always stays up!"
4,"Great Router, but...","This Linksys Router has some very nice features to it. What I really like is the web based prefrences area to change settings. And, if you already had a cable hookup before you bought this router, you can change the MAC address so you don't have to call your ISP saying you changed hardware devices (Don't worry, the manual will explain that).But, My first I bought kept freezing up. Returned it and got and new one, which worked just fine."
4,No time set-up,"This is the second router I bought to share a cable modem/dsl connection. The first was the SMC. After spending hours on the phone with SMC tech support, they recommended I take the box out and shoot it. I returned it and bought the Linksys. Connected a PC and mac in half an hour. Works great. Couldn't tell you how tech support was because I didn't need it."
1,Not a good product,"I purchased this product with the expectation that it would provide at least the level of operation stated it the description. Unfortunately, this is not the case. This device will either operate as a poor interface with the internet or will allow limited operation between connnected devices, but NOT BOTH. After spending many hours (6) with their Phillipines based support group, it has been determined that this is the way it works. I would suggest that anybody who purchases this device to do so at their own risk."
1,Poorly Run Company,My router arrived not working. That wouldn't be a big deal but when I contacted Linksys for an RMA number they never got back to me. Not the first time. Not the Second time. Not the third time. Not the fourth time. Do you want service like this??? I think not.
1,Dont buy this unreliable router. Buy Netgear instead.,"This machine does not work properly. Every so often it ""freezes up"" and has to be power-cycled (i.e. unplug it from the wall) to get it working again. (This information is actually in the manual!) About two months after buying it I bought a Netgear router instead, which is a far superior and much more stable product. My netgear has been running for 3600 hours (150 days) without any freezes, lock-ups, or other nonsense."
4,Good Router - Poor Documentation,"First of all, this router works great. I now have all my computers connected to my DSL connection. I no longer have to disconnect one cable to install it into a different computer for Internet access. It was easy to wire my computers to this router. I have not noticed any decrease in speed on my Internet connection.The problem was setting up the router's firmware. My best guess is that Linksys expects you to connect this router to a cable company modem instead of a DSL modem. In order to connect to a DSL modem, you must change the router's address from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.2.1. Be sure your DSL modem is not connected to the router when you do this.I could not find this information on the CD that came with the router. I had to go to the Linksys website for this information.Overall, I do recommend this router."
2,Buyer Beware,"This router does a fine job distributing the internet to my many PC's, Media Extenders, etc on my wired network. Hoewever, none of my PC's could see each other when I installed this (they could with the old router). Linksys support was useless, saying that internet distribution is the router's job, and I should see Microsoft about my computers. I wrote this purchase off and reinstalled my old (before the Cisco acquisition) Linksys router (same model number, but earlier firmware version). Now all my computers see each other and my DHCP table is full. Buy another router if in this situation."
1,"When it breaks, you'll be sorry!",I bought one of these three months ago and it broke. I've spent almost two months trying to get a new one because of my warranty but Linksys has done nothing. Good Luck!
2,"So-So Router, Poor Quality","Router worked okay for a while and the web interface was nice. Locked up every now and then, flashed the ROM to each latest release and the problem never went away. Finally after 13 months (1 month out of warranty) it died altogether.Bought another one with the wireless access point. Same deal. Keeps locking up. Had problems with past Linksys products as well, such as their PCI network cards that wouldn't work unless they were in a PCI slot that didn't share an interrupt.Last time I'll by anything from Linsys."
1,Amazon's poor customer service,"The Linksys router out of the box was faulty.It took 2 days of constant calling to get Linksystech support, all to tell me the unit was no good.I e-mailed Amazon for a replacement. It took them 3days to reply. ""We will send a mailer for it's return.""That was 16 days ago and I've seen nothing. ... Amazon should stick to books.Customers should buy their hard goods locally.FRS"
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,"its basically a plug-and-play device, only u need to unplug power from your modem to let the memory reset so the IP adress' match up. Just baught it today, so i cant say there are any major problems yet, but its cheap, and it does exactly what i want it to, thats give high speed internet to 2 computers. I use it with a Surfboard 3100 cable modem."
1,Works Great When it Works,"I have purchased two (2) Linksys BEFSR41 routers and both failed (Firmware error according to technical support). While they worked, they were great, therefore I will try one more time. If this one fails, then I will look elsewhere."
3,Very easy router with limited forwarding,this is a great beginner router which can get you up and runing realy fast however those who know anything about networking will quickly notice that you cannot use ports from another machine if they are forwarded to a different machine which is really weird. This was especially important for me because w/o forwarding port 80 to my server i couldn't serv my web site however upon forwarding port 80 all the other computers on the lag were unable to go to any website through port 80 :-\
1,Two defective units? Unlikely,"Two weeks ago I purchased this router. The setup CD seemed idiotproof, alas I couldn't get it to work. After talking with tech support, they recommended I return it as it must be faulty. I returned it yesterday and picked up another identical model. My mistake. Again, it would not work. I spoke with Linksys tech support (straining my brain trying to understand the foreign techies) for 38 minutes the first time, got disconnected, and 49 minutes the second time. The second guy was transferring me to his supervisor since he couldn't help me when we disconnected. So I called my IP's tech support. No accents which made thing a little smoother. 26 minutes later and she was going to have her super call me back. 9:40pm he calls back, gets some info and says HIS super will call back. 10:30pm and I'm on with him for 35 minutes. Yes, I have a life, but last night I sure didn't. Finally he suggested I return the faulty unit and get a D-Link. That's what I'm going to have to do."
3,Reliable ?,Had the unit about a year - which is rather short in my opinion for a unit lifespan. Got the ole blinking diagnostics light problem. Never could get it corrected - gave up and tossed it. This appears to be a common problem with the unit from web traffic. I can't recommend it. Reliability being my biggest problem with the unit.
1,Good price but ...,"Spec wise this router does everything one needs it to do. However, actually getting it to work is another story. After spending several hours trying different configurations and an hour on the phone with tech support, I was told I had a bad router and should take it back to the store and get another one. I did just that and after an hour of trying to get this new one working I gave up. Other reviewers seemed to have had good luck getting this particular router up and running, however, I won't be buying another Linksys product anytime soon. The amount of time I spent trying to configure defective products far outweighed the cost of the product. I ended up getting a Netgeat RP114 router and within 15 minutes of opening the box, I had the router working with my cable modem and 3 pcs."
3,"Good router, bad company","This router was excellent, when it WORKED (the first 2 weeks) and ebfore I had to deal with the tech support for a replacement (another month or so). This was the least professional group I had ever dealt with. Good luck."
2,Mine was defective,Easy to set up and configure. The port forwarding UI was simple and flexible as well. One of the four ports was broken. Good thing we had a hub already.
2,It's not compatable with the newer modems....,"I bought the BEFSR41 to connect 3 computers to my new Motorola Surfboard Modem SB4220. They are not compatable.After 5 HOURS on the phone with 4 different ""tech support"" experts, they had me upgrading firmware, then downgrading firmware, and finally running my cable from the modem thru a 10base-t hub. This slowed the signal to a managable rate and allowed the modem to function. But not at the speed the modem was designed for.Very frustrating Tech support.Very unhappy with the product.I will replace it soon, RMA is next.My cable company upgraded it's modems and have left this relic behind.Buyer beware."
2,Beware 1 year Waranty,"I have used this router quite successfully since purchased with the exception of an occasional need to reboot. My gripe is realy simple, out of the blue the router stopped functioning which means I can no longer access the internet (the unit is now ...hub because that still works). Linksys has a 1 year return policy and this is my 13th month with the product. They don't have an exchange, upgrade, or pay a fee for fixing the unit. I spoke to customer support and there was no flexibility, 1 year is 1 year. I now have to go out and purchase a new one all together. I will now look for a unit with more than a 1 year warranty which means I won't be purchasing another Linksys."
5,Linksys EtherFast Cable/DSL Router Model: BEFSR41,You want me to rate an item? Put the product link in the form. Why should I have to backtrack twice to do you a favor?
2,It's good when it works !!!,"Good product, responsive customer service representatives, but this router needs resetting almost every day. It just stops working without evident reason. I upgraded the firmware with the latest version without results. The problem might be somwhere else but it is not- to my best knowledge, and the employees from Linksys could not give me a satisfactory anser to that problem after several calls of mine either. Maybe it will work better with a different setup but is this normal? Maybe it needs a newer firmware? I Don't recommend this product anyway."
2,Linksys Not the Way to Go,"I bought this router just a little over a year ago today even after reading all of the negative reviews. Now I wish I hadnt. The router has died, no lights or anything, and so I'm stuck with a hunk of junk. It only had a 90 day warranty so that doesnt help. Buy a router with a lifetime warranty, trust me on this one, you need a lifetime warranty."
5,Great,"Much better than the Netgear RT311, I bought both for two offices, this is a cinch to install."
2,No Surge protection,My Unit was blown when I connected to higher power adpter by mistake. NO in built surge protection.. Ports become too hot rapidly...
1,Cheap Junk,"Out of the box I noticed it was missing over 1/2 the led indicators as the one pictured on amazon's site. They have cut them down to a power led, a led for each of the 4 ports and one for internet connectivity. All of them do nothing other than tell you if your cable is connected and the device is powered. The thing locks up every time there is more that one computer using high bandwith.The reset switch ( you'll be using this every 5 minutes) is in the back in a little hole. It is a pain to get to when you have a nice tight install with all the cabling. Easy to set up, so what! Every thing is easy to set up these days. Lousy support from Linksys. I will be returning this paperweight and buying an Asante or NetGear."
1,Crap product & I can't return it,Buyer beware - Amazon will not take back ANY merchandise over 30 days old. My Linksys router is now 3 months old and I need to reset it almost every day. This a major pain in the butt - almost as bad having to buy another $60 router - I guess you'll have have to decide which is worse.
5,Finally makes an Ethernet LAN live up to its promise...,"This arrived at 4:00 pm today and by 4:30 I had it installed, including reading the manual word-for-word (it's not long) and rebooting all PC's (required).I've had a fast Ethernet LAN for > 3 years and a DSL connection for > 1 year but never until today was I able to get any PC other than my ""primary"" desktop (where the DSL modem connected directly to the internal Ethernet NIC) to ""see"" the Internet.Now they all do, and the beauty of ""always on"" is suddenly real. Not only that, but I tested the Linksys' firewall/security features by asking ""Shields Up"" to probe all protocols and ports on my LAN (www.grc.com--use it right now if you never have), and my LAN is completely invisible to the world.If you have a LAN and fast 'net access, Buy This Product!"
1,Not worth the hassle,"Please search for the thread on the linksys support forum titled ""BEFSR41 v4 intermittent drop of connection"" which goes on for 4 pages with no reply from linksys support, I'd post a URL but that is against the review guidelines here at amazon.The only way to fix the problems that occur with this router is to buy a different model or better yet a different brand. It appears that Linksys doesn't really care about the issue.I returned this router after the second day of dealing with it's constant connection drops and bought a Belkin instead."
1,"Eventually locks up, buy a Nexland or Netgear instead.","The BEFSR11 (1-port) and BEFSR41 (4-port) are great when they work, but are notorious for having a bug that they will eventually lock up hard and not work. Resets and flashes often even will not fix them.Read the hardware forums at dslreports for more on this. Dozens of people have reported the same problems, and Linksys typically has denied it. I thought I'd be spared, but it happened to me. After about 10 failed attempts, I managed to flash it to newer firmware. It worked for about a month, then locked up tight.Buy a better brand. I wanted to like this; I use all Linksys network cards, hubs and switches and swear by them. But the routers, I swear AT them."
1,Product has a high defect rate,I bought a v1 BEFSR41 in summer 2000 and it broke just after the warranty period ended in fall 2001. Flashing red Diag light was on and the flash update fails. Out of warranty thus out of luck.
4,"Great Installation, no user manual","This router performed as promised. Following the CD to INSTALL it, is essential, and easy to do. But there is no manual, no quickstart guide, and no trouble-shooter that comes with it. All of those things are on the CD; limited as that is. And to make personal settings, refine it, or trouble-shoot it; you have to go online, and do research. The internal settings can be VERY complicated. I'm attempting to use it for my TiVo to transfer recordings from my TiVo to my PC. It is taking almost more work than is worth the effort. The Router itself works exactly as it should. Since there is no manual, and findind Linksys Tech Support is very difficult; I'd suggest finding a good tech support place online, read it, and see if you want to delve into all that this type of connection may require. All in all, I may go back to NOT using a router at all."
5,Great Product,This router was quick and easy to set up. The instuctional CD was very well done. I am very pleased with the total performance of this router and would recommend it to anyone looking to set up a small network.
1,Linksys BEFSR41 EtherFast Cable/DSL Router,"The router I received was unusable. Although it was packed in a box that appeared to be for the American market, the firmware inside displayed some Asian language (Korean?). I was not able to set it up for DNS service with an American company. I have returned this unit to Amazon and had to purchase a replacement from a local source."
4,Thoughts on reliability,"Other reviewers have pointed out that these routers tend to die after some time. If you're getting a Linksys router, you may want to consider doing what I did. Noting the frailty of the unit, I bought the three year warranty, where the store will replace the unit if it breaks, no questions asked. Even with the extra warranty, the unit was inexpensive, and if it breaks, the store probably has more clout with Linksys than I do. The four star rating is due to the unit's easy setup."
1,A disappointing product from Linksys,"A real disappointment. At first I was very happy with it. It installed easily and worked well. But......2-3 times per day, it hangs. You can't access the internet, you can't access the router via the browser interface, you can't even ping it. The solution is to power cycle it, but this is awkward as there is no power switch. Have to pull the power cable and re-insert.If this happened once a week or so, it would be acceptable, but 2-3 times per day makes it basically useless to me. It's going back. This is unfortunate, as I am a fan of Linksys products (and prices). But I also like Netgear, so I guess I will give them a try."
1,..Never Again!,"I received the unit and unboxed it,(Version 4.1).Setting it up is easy(it comes with a install disc that is idiot proof,however it wouldn't finished the set up.I called the tech support and after about three hours they decided that it was defective and that i would have to take it back to where i purchased it.Amazon made it right.I have since purchased a westell unit and it works perfectly."
2,Can't Sustain Inbound FTP Connections,"Two reasons I bought this: 1. To move all my computers behind a router so I wouldn't have to leave one on all the time; and 2. to be able to handle inbound FTP connections to my FTP server. The router functioned acceptably for basic functions (easy to configure, etc.), but inbound FTP connections would consistently fail after transfering a few thousand bytes. Each failure would require that the router be reset.This item is probably OK for most people, but it couldn't handle the one primary thing that I needed, hence the low rating. It's now running as a replacement for my old hub (also a LinkSys) which has an overheating problem. You'd think I'd learn..."
1,Dead On Arrival,"Out of the box, only the power light lit up when I connected my Ethernet cables to it. The cable access technician confirmed it was DOA. Seems cheaply made."
1,Ports 3 & 4 quit working,"It worked fine for about a year and now ports 3 & 4 stopped working. I'll probably buy a different brand next time, maybe Netgear or 3-Com."
1,Dropped Connection / Required Reboot,"It worked great out of the box until....After a while the router started dropping the connection to my DSL provider and failing to restart. The only way to bring it back on-line was to unplug the power and restart it. Sometimes it didn't stay up for more than a minute.Tech support did not respond to my e-mail at first, and then were useless.The warrantee is 1 year - BEWARE."
3,Slingbox Friendly but short life span.,"I bought this for use with my new Slingbox and it works perfectly. The only thing is that when I set up the sling box there was a IP address problem where the router did not have the correct setting but it was quickly solved by reviewing all the places where the router needed to check and match IP addresses. Moreover, it does ""hide"" your computer from intruders. However, the downside is that it lasted only one year and I had to get a new router. When it works, it really works, but when it dies, it's dead."
5,Too Safe,The linksys works great as a router and I dont even notice a slowdown in speed as I have in other routers but the problem is the firewall options dont work that well and you cannot send anything via ftp or anyother way of sending besides attaching via e-mail. So if you think you can handle that(I have) then it is the best. Otherwise you might want to consider something else
2,Lousy Mac Support,"I'm trying to set up my home network - I have a PC and 2 Macs. Somewhere I read that this router supports Macs, but there's no instructions in the manual or on their website (that should tell you something) and Mac software is not provided by Linksys. I've been waiting 3 hours so far for tech support to send me instructions, but haven't heard from them yet. Looks like buying this router to network Macs was a mistake."
2,"Worked great for 3 years, now it needs to be rebooted","I've had this device for over 3 years, and the first 3 years it worked great. Extremely easy to setup and use.Unfortunately, no matter if it is a wireless or wired connection, the device seems to ""lock up"" and no network traffic goes thru. All I have to do is unplug the router for 5 seconds and plug it back in, and all is fine. That gets really annoying really fast. I even updated the router with the latest flash rom from linksys, but this did not help at all.Is this a good router? Yes. If you plan to have this router for a long time, I would recommend NetGear instead. I'm going out today to buy a new NetGear wireless router.You might be safe to buy this one, because in 3 years there will probably be better technology out there that you will want to upgrade to."
1,Died,"Bought this router because it was a known brand and had the included 4-port switch. It worked well for a year and then started to die each day. The connection to all PCs would hang and the router would have to be power-cycled to get back online. I don't know whether the issue was with the router, the switch, or DHCP, but it was been replaced.Save your money and buy another brand."
4,absolutely happy with it.(except the cabling hassle),"I am so happy I purchased this product for just one thing. My companys proprietary VPN works only with the linksys NAT/Router. My friends had purchased other brands and they could not get it working with remote access VPN connection with my office. I do not know the real reason though, something to do with IPSec pass through and local DHCP assigned ip address.I am very happy with the configuration stuff, all port forawarding and DMZ and everything is very easy to configure.It worked right away with the default configuration when connected to my cable modem and three computers. Had no trouble since the start.The only problem I faced in setting up my home LAN was the cabling problem. It really took lot of time to find a better cabling method for my house!( I have some extra holes in my house to be closed before winter!)"
3,Trying Set-up,"After a few false starts, I was able to get this router to work great. I am not sure how or why I had problems, or how or why the problems went away. I have used it both on DSL and now cable. It works better on Cable. I actually have a Win 98, Win 2000, Win NT and an iMac all hooked up to it. The documentation that was included is sketchy at best and the online help is not worth looking up. The hold time for technical support gave me enough time to fix it myself, so I guess support did work."
3,Rough Going with PPPoE,"I installed the product to share a DSL connection between two PCs. My ISP uses PPPoE for login... this was a real pain to get working. I finally got it working by talking to engineers I work with at work, as far as how to configure each PC, and also Linksys gave me a firmware patch by email that seemed to make the PPPoE login work much better. Now it works flawlessly, but I guess you have to be a network engineer to get it working in some situations."
4,easy setup,I had this thing running in 5 min. no problems at all.the easiest piece of hardware I have ever done.works great--buy it.
3,it's cheap for a reason,"Bought this router on a recommendation from a friend. That was a mistake. It works, mostly. It was certainly easy to set up, but I had to reboot the connection every 10 minutes or so.It's a good router for minor usage, but for two college kids who have to be online a good deal of the time, it's almost more trouble than it's worth. If you just want to be online for short periods of time, then this is a good router for you. But for anyone else, spend that bit more money on something more reliable."
1,WARNING -- Not for Class A or B,"WARNING -- Version three of this router (the newest, currently shipping/on the shelf version with firmware 1.04.8) will not accept static or DHCP IP addresses that are Class A or Class B. It is arrogant and willfully lazy of Linksys to ship this router with this kind of problem. As of this writing (9-10-03) there is no firmware upgrade fix available. Only the original firmware version from 6-20-03 is available, and you CAN NOT use the firmware for the previous versions of this model with the version 3 model. I hope this saves you hours on tech support with temps being paid to lead you through a diagnostic tree with no actual knowledge of the device."
2,"Has all the features, Pity they don't work","I have had this product for a while. For the first few months I owned I had nothing but good things to say about it. It allow multiple PC's to share a connection, provides some measure of improved security, and effectively isolates the DSL PPPoe software so I don't have to install it on my and my wifes PC, and my notebook or reinstall when I upgrade, and gets the PC started because I do not have to log to PPPoe each time my computer turns on. I incorrectly attributed the occasion glitches to my DSL modem.Then I tried to setup a server and use forwarding. This has problems so serious it could only be described as unworkable. Some other people don't have the same problem, others do. I have tried everything. The Tech Support is useless. I plan to try a competitors product, anyone want to swap?"
2,This product may not support IPSec or VPN as advertised.,"Contrary to the Linksys product's documentation, and the information on the product's website, this unit did NOT support Check Point VPN-1 SecuRemote client behind the unit's firewall. The DMZ function was also useless with my VPN client software. Linksys Tech. Support was completely helpless. // I purchsed an Asante' FR3004 and had it up and running and supporting my VPN client software in under 5 Mins. // I sold my Linksys unit to a friend who only needed functionality for standard websurfing and e-mail which the Linksys unit does support nicely. If you need advanced routing capabilities, this Linksys router probably should be avoided."
1,Frequent power-offs required,"I liked this router initially, as setup was easy and the html interface to all the features was really nice.Then, it started...my network connection would just go away...I looked in vain at my software applications and then finally figured out that it was the router. I had to powerdown then power back up the router, then it would work again for a while.I called Linksys tech support and after finally getting through, I was told to reinstall Windows 2000 and that would solve the problem.I took another tack and bought a NetGear RT314. The NetGear isn't nearly as pretty, and anything beyond simple setup requires you to Telnet into the router (instead of using a Web interface), but....but....but....it has run and run and run and run and I've never had to touch it. I've never had to power it down once.IT JUST WORKS!So, avoid the Linksys and get a NetGear"
1,I'll never buy linksys gear again,"I bought this from a well-known chain store, took it home, and set it up. It worked for a few hours and then suddenly died. No internet connection, nothing. I took it back to the store and got another one of the same model. This one lasted long enough for me to send in for the rebate, then it too died. The store would not take it back since I had sent for the rebate. I could not reach anyone at Linksys despite hours of waiting on hold on a toll call. Needless the say the rebate never came either..."
2,Terrible customer service,"I bought this router brand new at Compusa and within four weeks, it stopped working completely. It took four phone calls and six emails to Linksys to get a return authorization number and then another several weeks to get the router back.The new router has worked fine for over a year which is why I didn't give it just one star. Additionally, the manual had no information on setup on a Mac and they do not offer Macintosh tech support. If you own a Mac or value good customer service, I would not recommend this router."
2,Short Life Span,"6 weeks after the 1 year warranty expired on my BEFSR41 version2, the product went into an irrecoverable state in which the WAN port wasn't active, the web gui wasn't reachable by LAN port, and the red diag light just stayed lit up (even after resets as instructed by support from Linksys). ...The solution ends up being the need to purchase another cable/dsl router. The D-link DI-704P will hopefully have a longer life (it already has better features, and a better price).Apart from the failure, the linksys is good (although missing a print server port)."
5,Don't buy this router with Qwest DSL,"Although I think this product was pretty good, I found out the hard way that it doesn't work well with the Cisco 678 DSL modem provided by Qwest DSL. Since the Cisco 678 is actually a router, it doesn't like having another router on the LAN. I tried using the PPPoE option on the Linksys to connect to Qwest and not use the Cisco at all, but that didn't work. A simple solution is to get the Linksys 5-port hub or switch and connect that to the Cisco router. This is a simple plug-n-play solution that works great."
2,Linksys router review,"This router was purchased about six months ago .... It ran fine for a while, but once we enountered technical difficulty, the real problems emerged. It is virtually impossible to get technical assistance from Linksys. You can't speak to someone or even hold for someone. The only access is to have them call you back when they are ready. We have waited four days now for them to call and have received no response. During this time, we have called again and again only to be assured thay we have been moved up in priority. Still no response. E-mail elicits no response either. Buy this if you plan to never have to use service from the manufacturer."
4,What about VPN's??,"The product is great as long as you keep using it isolated of a business/intracompany environment. What I mean is, if you try to login into your company VPN, you will have a hard time.Hugo GarciaLaredo, TX."
2,An ok produce for home use,"I wouldn't suggest this for business use though. First off Linksys's customer support sucks. I've had this for a year now and pressing the reset button has become customary. This is real irritating especially when you have to keep on re-configuring your router (passwords, port forwading, dmz hosting, etc) From reading all these reviews, they seriously overrate this item. But then again I figure that most of this are coming from home users. If a business owner though, reliabilty is an issue with this router. For the real scoop and more detailed reviews go to cnet.com, their computer hardwarr/software reviews are their speciality."
1,Do not buy this router!,I have had nothing but problems with this router. It locks up constantly and needs to be powered off and back on regularly. During a firmware upgrade it locked up and I had to return it for a new one. I've lived with it for over a year now and it has quit working all together. Linksys does not have an 800 number for support and they do not respond to e-mails. Get a NetGear instead. When the Linksys died I replaced it with a rt314 which works flawlessly.
1,Sending it Back!,"I read all of the ""It worked right out of the box"" reviews and finally decided to order one. However, this was just not the case for me. I first used the Quick Installation instructions, then the User's Manual, then the Web site and finally called support - connected twice and was dropped both times after extended periods on HOLD. Just could not get the product to work. I took Linksys out of the loop and connected every time, so it was not the network cards, cables or the cable modem. Will probably go with a 4-port hub and security software, should save a lot of fustration. Sending it back!"
2,Save your money and buy better,Ihad this router for about 1 yr before I had trouble with it. The support sucks as well as the router for the money. I went cheaper and got a better product.
5,Linksys BEFSR41,"I've had this router for about two years, and it functions beautifully. At one point, I had trouble sending email, and it turned out that the trouble was with my ISP. Setting the MTU to 1492 soved that problem.Russel Patterson"
3,Great idea for internet Access only,"When I installed this it took about 15 minutes to shut everything off, plug everything in and get into the management interface. It tok me no time at all to configure this switch and get online. Then, I read, that only one person could be ""live on the interent"" at one time. I have 3 people plugged in this switch and all 3 of us play games online. We also use netmeeting alot. This device will only allow ONE to play at a time or use netmeeting. This is a serious oversight on the part of linksys. I returned my switch because of this. It is great if you want inter access ONLY. Two people playing games? NO Two or more people on netmeeting? NO. Really think about what you do online and see if this limitation will affect you before buying this product."
5,GREAT ROUTER!,"I'M A NOVICE WHEN IT COMES TO COMPUTER STUFF.THIS WAS EASY TO HOOK UP.I JUST RAN MY WIRES AND CONNECTED EVERYTHING,TURNED ON EVERYTHING AND I DID NOT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.IT JUST WORKED.CAN'T GET ANY EASIER THAN THAT!"
1,Defective Product as recived & Zero support.,"The instruction manual and set-up make extensive use of the reset button, which on the unit I recieved was not there. When I called Linksys to see if they had an easy fix, I was put on hold (not unusual), but finally a message came on telling me that no one could assist me and to leave my number. It's been 5 days now and still no one has called. No matter how good the product, if the customer support is not there, the product becomes usless. In additon, where is Linksys's quality control?"
1,Poor customer service....Do not buy,"Bought the 8 port Linksys at a store. Was excited to hook up a few pc's to share a dsl connection. Could not get it to work.... called tech support, only to wait approximately 45 minutes to get disconnected. Called back, waited another 45 minutes to finally to talk to a tech. This tech was very rude and inconsiderate, he gave advice on what to try...I wanted to try it while I was on the phone with him, especially after waiting 45 minutes but he was insistant on go onto the next call. He told me if I had problems to call back since they are open 24 hours. I told him if I had problems after he gave me his advice that I would return it because I felt as though he was trying to push me off the phone. His advice did not work. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Bought a NETGEAR RT314 had it running up in 5 minutes after talking to tech support. Also, they were very friendly and cooperative."
3,A Caveat,"Be sure you are shipped the latest version of this router. The full Linksys model number is ""BEFSR41 ver X"" where X is currently 1,2,3, or 4. The version is not listed on the box; only below the Linksys logo on a label attached to the bottom of the router case. Why is the router version important? One of the reasons I purchased this router was as a hardware firewall. For maximum protection, it's a very good idea to keep the router firmware updated. Unfortunately, the latest Linksys patches and security upgrades can not be applied to older versions of the BEFSR41. In my case I placed an order with Amazon.com on 9/25/05 and received ver 2 of this router, a version Linksys stop making late 2003 - early 2004. Version 4 of this router has been available since early this year. I'd given this router a higher rating if Amazon.com had sent me the current model!"
4,LinkSyS 4-Port Cable Router,"A few month ago I added cable modem Interent service (ATT Broadband/New England). The technician came in and setup the service on my laptop which I also use at work. That was a smooth process and I was blazing on the Internet. Unfortunately, ATT Broadband/New England uses your MAC address of your cable modem and your network card to verify and release a signal to your machine (ie. another machine will not work on the system). Therefore you need to purchase a router like this one which has its own MAC address which you have to call ATT broadband and tell them this 12-digit ID number. Once you do this it works great.The only problem I ran into was I initially tried to clone the MAC address onto the router...don't do this it will crash and lock you out of service and access to the controls of the router.Good buy for the money."
4,IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT,"Great product BUT if you are on AT and T cable -- they HAVE TO PING YOUR NEW ROUTER!!! The instructions don't tell you this and I screwed around with it for 2 hours before calling AT and T to see if it was a problem on their end! They need the mac address off the router to ping it. I was up in 5 minutes after at&t did their thing.Best thing about this thing over a net hub is the computers can access the web individually, w/o the server computer being turned on. I like it."
1,Frequent dropped connections,"I bought this router about 1 week ago and followed the instructions exactly from a-to-z. It worked. After running my normal software like uTorrent and Skype I began noticing lots of droppage. Both these software require uninterrupted connections. So the frequent drops made it a pain to work with this router. If you only do regular browsing on the internet, you might not notice many disconnects and think the occasional delays as just net traffic. I read suggestions to upgrade the firmware and went to linksys site to get it. After upgrading it, it refused to work altogether. The power led began blinking and then it was useless. Phone support was helpful and courteous but still couldn't solve my problem and had to return it for refund."
1,Junk,"I replaced my old BEFSR41 that was damaged by lightning with this newer revision. I have had nothing but trouble with connection problems on the modem side. I've read lots of similar complaints on the net. I have the latest firmware. The connection to the modem hangs, and to fix the problem you have to unplug the router, plug a computer to the modem, do some surfing to clear out the problem, then re-attach the router to the modem. Ugh!!!"
1,Purchase at own risk,"Bought one at BB and, at first, it worked well. But two weeks later I had to 'reset' the router meaning unplugging, reattaching wiring, and finally calling my IP for help since my Quickstart help couldn't help cause it couldn't connect to the internet. I learned alot about routers then including resetting this router. Since then its been a continuous battle of resetting retuning and finally rejecting this equipment. On the bright side it didn't cost all that much. I would steer clear of this unless your into frustration and futility."
1,Drops connection daily,"Finally disconnected this piece of doodoo. Got very tired of resetting, unplugging, etc. Man, never thought a wired connection would be such a pain in the (&*%^*."
2,"Inexpensive, but you get what you pay for","I bought this product without reading the other reviews -- big mistake. The setup wasn't too bad once I found out that I had to configure my modem to be compatible, which couldn't be done without a password that was a deep dark secret. Finally got that from my ISP and things seemed to be going well. But my enthusiasm was shortlived. I lose my connection about every two hours. Linksys's so-called tech support was no help whatsoever. My ISP did walk me through the procedure to get it up and running again, but who wants to do that over and over. I have ordered a combination modem/router from my ISP (they have excellent support) and plan to throw the Linksys router off the nearest high building."
2,HIT AND MISS...,"Weekly disconnects which tech support wasn't able to solve. Finally, it wouldn't connect at all. After spending the better part of a day with the LIVE CHAT SUPPORT (VERY helpful, btw) it was concluded that the unit was defective and needs to be replaced. As this is my 2nd unit I won't be buying Linksys again."
1,Stay away from this router! Port Forwarding causes dissconects every 5-10 minutes.,"I have had nothing but problems with this router. I just got it today and it works except when you need to forward ports for games and other applications. I absolutely need to be able to forward ports! So, basically this router became useless to me!. Once you forward ports it starts a disconnect cycle every 5-10 minutes. Turn off port forwarding and the problem goes away.There are a ton of people that have this exact same problem on the Linksys official forums. There has been no official response from Linksys on this issue and there has not been a firmware update for about a year now. It seems to me that Linksys is not willing to fix these problems that countless people have been begging to be fixed. I will return this and probably get a D-Link seeing as a ton of people that have problems with this router switch to a D-Link and have a much better experience."
2,Problems with this router!,The first router was faulty. This router replacement was very difficult to setup. I called Linksys for help and they gave up saying it was also faulty. I played with it for another hour and was finally able to get it to work. Now it seems to work fine!!!
1,It doesn't work,I purchased this based on other reviews. What a disappointment!!!!!!!! The cd instillation didn't work so I contacted their award-winning support. Guess what??????? It STILL doesn't work. I guess I'll have to pay some tech person to try and figure things out. That of couse will be added to the cost of the router which will make it less a value than Cisco would have you believe. I can't understand why they can't make these things easier for the average Joe to connect and get running.
1,Unhappy,"I purchased this router refurbished through Amazon from a company called ""Delaware"". I does not work right. Delaware was not helpful at all. I won't be buying anything from them in the future."
4,Serviceable Router that I purchased in 2002,"No problems out of the box. Will do what you purchased it to do. But we are talking about a [...] router and the technology has advanced since then. Nice, inexpensive alternative but if you are looking for better performance and more features, time to move on.Purchased this exact router on October 31, 2002 from Amazon. It is still in my order history and used the link from that order to write my review."
4,Linksys Kicks butt!,"Got it to work after a few hours of tweaking, it serves my mac7600 and PC running Doze98. Be sure to buy cables as it doesn't come with any and if using a mac disable all proxy check boxes in internet explorer. Set the tcp\ip to ethernet and dhcp server and you should be in business!"
3,I bought a lemon,"This router is great, it works like it is supposed to and is super easy to set up. It worked for about 2 days, then lights started flashing and now the thing is fried and not coming back! :-("
2,Good product - but expect ZERO support,"I bought a linksys BEFSR41 a few years ago when I wanted to expand my home network. It was fast, and generally reliable... until it broke. The problem is, it broke just outside of warranty (it figures), and Linksys wouldn't even give me the time of day! I specifically asked Linksys if there were repair options available, or if I could get a replacement for a fee. They basically said ""go buy another one."" Why would I do that when the first one broke and they gave me no support?"
1,NO iMac support.,"This product is NOT intended for a Macintosh only network. The setup disk that is included is PC only. Manual setup may be possible, but I was not able to - though I had my ISP, Linksys and Apple tech support on the phone. Sadly, Linksys is nearly proud of their lack of Mac support."
2,"good while it lasts, but doesn't last long","As others have reported, quality is disappointing. Thought it was a good router at a decent price, until it started breaking down, regularly (shows red diagnostic light).Linksys website indicates that company knows about the problem, and will replace (only) if within warranty period. Technically within their rights, but seems unethical to me -- they sold a defective product and aren't taking the responsibility for it.Recommend you avoid this, and be careful about other Linksys products."
1,This thing has issues !,"Yes it's simple to setup, but so are all routers these days, that is not the problem. I bought this for my office and it needs to be reset daily, if not more. It will randomly stop working until it's reset, we originally thought it was our ISP, but after many frustrating hours we dicovered that simply resetting this router fixed our problem, everytime. Why? no clue. noone has a clue. Buy a D-Link they are reliable!"
4,Linksys BEFSR41,"I purchased this router from Amazon (best price anywhere). I have Verizon DSL service. The router didn't work properly out of the box. Tech support has not returned any of my 11 phone calls in 2 weeks. I figured out that I needed a firmware upgrade (which I got off the linksys site). The router has been up for 9 days now. I have an 8-port Netgear hub plugged into it and they get along great. This is a super product once you get past the poor technical support. PROS: easy to configure, nice firewall feature, good pricing, has nice traffic monitoring feature (used with free software on the net). CONS: poor tech support, case is rather clumsy (can't place hub on top or under router)."
3,"works fine, but","the router works perfectly. But only after fixing a bug with the firmware, (it stopped working and it had to be reset to connect again). I recommend that if you buy this product, you download the latest firmware upgrade located in the linksys website. Other than that hassle, the router works perfectly."
3,Unabled to make work with my GTE DSL,I was not able to get the Linksys to work with my GTE DSL service. The Linksys was never able to acquire an IP address from the ISP. Linksys Tech Support was unable to resolve the problem. I subsequently bought another similar product from a local computer store and it worked right off the bat. I have no idea what the problem was with the Linksys whether it was a defective unit or some other compatibility issue with the Fujitsu/Orckit DSL modem which GTE supplies.
2,"Good, but not great","I've owned this product for a few years now, and it recently just died - the ethernet switch portion is completely dead, which means no computer using ethernet can be attached to it, although the WAN connection still works (which still renders it useless).Perhaps my negative impressions are mostly due to me being an early adopter of this product. I found the docutmentation to be poorly written, and some features half-implemented (the firewall/Internet security portion of the product). I use a Mac, and the firmware upgrades only work using a PC (since I use Virtual PC, I was able to perform updates). I paid nearly $200 for the product, but now it costs a lot less. So is $200 a good deal for 2 years of performance? I'm not so sure."
5,Excellent product great deal,"For the functionality you get this product is a superb deal. You could go out and buy a professional quality router for at least 5 times the cost, but this product has all the functionality an amateur or a small business would require at a fraction of the cost. The ease of use is great and it practically does not require documentation to install. It is nice to know that it is virtually impossible for someone to hack into your system with this little device. Took me about 15 minutes to set it up. Its been up for several weeks now no problems. Friends have reported problems but they are using DHCP INTERNALLY to manage their network and they move PCs around. You are better off statically assinging IP addresses to your private network than using DHCP internally. DHCP is great for managing IP addresses for larger networks, smaller networks, stick with static IP addresses. Thats my advice."
5,It sounded too good to be true...............,"But it is...this is one of the easiest routers I ever installed, it works beautifully with Bellsouth Dsl and even made my conection faster...almost plug and play. If you want to network all of your computers at home run to the store and get this. It's awesome."
1,Don't Buy the BEFSR41 if you xDSL provider is Bell South,"I had hell with the thing. It worked great for the first 3 weeks then downhill. Amazon shipped me a replacement, Linksys said that it was bad also. Finally, after dealing with their aweful and I mean aweful tech support, Linksys told me that they had issues with Bell South. I am still waiting for their high level tech support to call me back after 5 days of waiting. I download Sygate and NO problems."
1,This Linksys router is a piece of junk,"The only thing positive I can say about this is that it's easy to install. Just plug and go. But that's it. The product itself isn't reliable, the customer support website is awful and customer support isn't much better. I have gone through 2 of these routers in 5 months. I purchased 1 new from Amazon in June and it worked fine until the end of September when it just decided to stop working. After spending 2-3 hours with customer support, they finally agreed to replace it. Now, 2 months later, my replacement has died as well."
5,2 Years and running,"I had this router/switch at my house for over 2 years running without a problem. I was amazed at the performance.Based on my experience with this product, I would highly recommend a Linksys. My internet access relies on it and it had came through all the time. I also like the firewall feature.For the price and quality, it is a 5 stars no doubt.Best regardsJ @ Sadoun Satellite Sales"
4,Once you get it working its great,Heard all the good things about the product and just got DSL and purchased it to share the connection. It worked great for connections and when I decided to put a web server it began to act flakey. (Locking up and such) a new patch to the firmware fixed everthing. It has good documentation so a person with minimal computer skills (they know the difference between RAM and hard drive space) can get it running or know someone who can help. 4 stars because of the flakey firmware.
5,Great alternative to Windows Internet Connection Sharing,"I recently purchased this product because I was having trouble with Microsoft's Internet Connection Sharing after upgrading to Windows ME.I was very pleased with the simplicity of setting up this router. I already have 3 computers connected to a hub, with this router I simply replaced the hub, plugged in the line coming from the cable modem and called my serivice provider to tell them I needed to provision a new MAC address. I was up and running in under 10 minutes.I have heard stories that cable companies do not want you using these. I guess the trick is not telling them what you are doing. The good news is they cannot determine what you are using other than it is a Linksys product."
2,It works - for a little while,"I have purchased four Linksys routers over the past four years - never has one lasted more than 12 months. My last worked for about five months until I had to reset it every few hours to keep an internet connection. I work from home, via the internet, so this is unacceptable to me. Despite the claims that Linksys is the best, I made the move to D-Link today - my speed doubled and hopefully it will last longer than the Linksys has."
4,"Works well, but a few annoyances","I've been running the BEFSR41 for about a year and for the most part it's worked flawlessly. However, the DHCP server appears faulty. Occasionally, I get an IP Conflict when a new computer logs in. In addition, when looking at the computers that have DHCP-assigned IP addresses (through the administration access), the reporting is almost completely erratic. For example, almost never are all the computers shown, and refreshing the screen has no effect. Linksys tech support has verified this is not working properly, but has no solution. PPoE to log into SBC's DSL works great, and port forwarding is also passable, though you have to assign a static IP to the devive you want to route to (rather than the MAC address or device name), which is a bit of a pain. Overall, for the price, it works pretty well."
4,"For What it Offers, it Delivers Very Well","Don't expect a powerhouse or a routing/firewall solution as flexibile as some software solutions, but for what this device offers, it delivers well. It does have all of the standard routing/firewall options, such as port forwarding, but it is more limiting in the total possible ports forwarded, and other configuration items that are much more flexible with a software solution. However, for the price, it's hard to beat in the SOHO environment, especially if you don't have a computer to dedicate to the routing/firewall duties.The only serious drawbacks I've ever encountered with the product are the limit on ports forwarded and an annoying habit, every so often (once a week, it seems) for the unit to just up and die (requiring a power cycle). A firmware upgrade may solve that problem, however."
5,Fantastic Product!,I have two computers using a Motorola cable modem for AT&T/Mediaone Internet Services. After trying for over a week to get Win98's ICS to work without success I bought this product. What a difference! I had this up in 5 minutes. It basically configured itself - all I had to do was check everything over. I was also suprised because I'm using BlackIce Defender (personal firewall) and there weren't any conflicts. It also appears to clean up the connection - the pages are loading more quickly than when I ran without it. If you have a small home network and want to share your cable connection - buy this product! For the money it is well worth it. Not only do you get a high speed network and internet connection but you get the added security of NAT and the built in firewall. I didn't have to use tech support so I can't comment on that.
2,Corrupts downloads! It's true!,"I read through the many reviews on this product and thought the good far outweighed the bad...so I thought I'd give it a try.The first evening I tried to set it up, I followed the instructions to the letter. Entered all of the required information and I couldn't browse the Internet from any of my client machines. I could ping and tracert, but I could't get any website to come up. I gave up for the night and turned everything off. When I came back the next day to try again, I turned it back on and it worked...go figure.Anyway, I figured it's working now so I'll upgrade the firmware as Linksys recommends. I tried numerous times to download their firmware, but each time I tried to unzip it I either got an error telling me the file was corrupt, or it would generate an illegal operation.I'm going to give it some time and see how things go simply because this was the solution I needed. I hope that I (or Linksys) get the problems ironed out."
1,Less than one star,"It was bought used. Shipped without inside wrapping. No wiring. And to top this, the item was taped around several times (as if to hold it together) and when the tape was removed it fell apart plus it was dirty/oily inside."
1,Linskeys Router,"Product was suppose to be in excellent shape but wasn't. Seller did refund payment, but had difficult time contacting seller and have contacted seller since refund, but still no reply. Cannot return item if no address known to return. Plus product was not as described, so I lose shipping amount if I do return."
1,AVOID THIS PRODUCT LIKE THE PLAGUE,"This product corrupts data on downloads. It seems like a flaw in the overall design. Tech support is horrible. Avoid this product like the plague.(Linksys says its probably in ethernet card incompatibility problem, ive tested on a couple major brand name cards still same problem)You have my warning."
1,Cisco,This router is junk. You can buy a cisco router on ebay for roughly 3 times as much and it will have 1000 times the functionality and reliability. Why would you buy anything lesser?
1,lol no wireless,"Who would buy this outdated thing now? This thing has NO wireless capabilities. It doesn't even have a cool looking antennae (which everyone knows is just for show but hey, whatever sells). DON'T waste your money on this and get a WRT54GL and then flash DD-WRT onto it for a $600 class router."
4,Highly Recommended-Fantastic Performance at a Good Price,"Me and my fellow geeks often have LAN parties (no, they're not what you think-we set up the lan, but really spend most of our time blasting music at ungodly volumes, bbquing, and swimming...) anyway, we recently (as a group) purchased this actual hub. It didn't bonk out on us the way in which our old one had, and it also allowed easy (or as easy as could be epected) file sharing.The only downside that I can think of is the fact that this thing takes FOREVER to set up, especially when you're dying to frag all of you buddies to hell. It took at least three hours to set this up, including installing NIC cards into all of the computers.If this is your first LAN-type of thing you're buying, I would recommend this. It's generally pretty easy to set up a small in-home network (just get a few books on TCP/IP networking (UUCP is a pain), perhaps a bottle of wine and an empty afternoon...you'll be golden)."
3,Its nice but...,"The good.This runs right out of the box. I was literally up in seconds. And it only took me a few minutes to get some of the advanced features working.The Bad.I couldn't get certain things working. FTP sites with port numbers other than 21 wouldn't respond. And only 10 ports to forward, it just doesn't seem like enough. Especially if you're going to be running more than 2 computers off of the router.If you're a ""power user"" I would just recommend getting a linux box set up with IPMASQ going, its cheaper, you'll learn some cool things and its more configurable.more"
1,Horrible!!,"This router is known to have frequent issues with continous disconnects from the 100mb port connections. Do not buy it! You will only be wasting your money and giving yourself a headache. ...I have this router. I disconnects and reconnects continously. I have tried every troubleshooting step to resolve and none have worked. It occurs at 10Mb/full 100mb/full, auto neg on, auto neg off, It is a piece of ...!!"
2,Poor quality and performance,"I picked up one of these for my employer, for a small office.The performance is terrible, port forwarding is buggy at best, and there are definite firmware bugs.For the home user, it's not bad...but forget about small LANs.This is an Ethernet to Ethernet solution folks, it uses your external DSL modem (can we say router?) and it can make some aspects of your network interesting.A port scan reveals that netbios ports are open, but filtered...when they were not opened at all.questionable. I'll check out Netgear some time.Netmax's ""Firewall in a Box"" is a much nicer solution that a novice can install onto an older PC. Much more flexible than this piece of junk Linksys."
5,Watch seller's description on this product,"This was my experience. I bought a NEW product from a seller. When I received it and opened it, I found there's no Setup Wizard CD inside and no factory sealed labels on product. At that moment, I knew this is a used one but I paid by NEW price. After I checked with Cisco's engineers and they proved the one I received is not a NEW product from their database record. Of course, I filed a claim to A-to-Z team and returned it. Then I paid attention on seller's description for this router, I focused on NEW, FACTORY SEALED LABEL, etc. After I re-ordered a new one and followed installation CD steps, it works with my home's network without calling Cisco's tech support."
2,"Slow, sporadic failures","This router really slowed down my whole network. Often time I would lose connection to the internet and would have to reset the modem and reset windows networking connections. It seems to work well for other people, but I'm rather disappointed."
2,Does not work well with PPPoE,"If you have a DSL modem, I would think twice about getting this router. It works fine for intranet communications, but it is constantly dropping the connection with the DSL modem. Often when it does try to reconnect, it will say the LCP Negotiation has failed (whatever that means), and there is not sufficient documentation that explains why this problem occurs. After all, if you are buying this router, you should always have your connection on, and not have to worry about the LCP Negotiation. It doesn't ""just work,"" something I supposed I have gotten to used to using Macs."
5,Excellent product!,"After setting up the router and figuring out which programs required what ports and forwarding those ports, everything worked smoothly. I highly recommend this product, as it does exactly what it is supposed to do, and setup is simple!"
1,"DIS ROUTER MON, SHE GO BAD FAST","Dis one, she no good mon. Last mebe, what? 3 monts zall. I buy 3 but don buy no mo."
2,Big Troubles when the wall crumbles,"I bought this product, and after setting it up and configuring a Linksys card, (just over 4.5 hours later) it worked beautifully.... that is until a few days ago. It started freezing up, and then yesterday I returned to find a router that does not work.I have now spent 12+ hours and talked to 6 expert techs that have no idea how to fix this problem. Most of the ""experts"" are less skilled in computer networking than I am and I am a film director. Additionally, the software does not fire correctly, and once on the wrong path is not recoverable.Therefore, I would be very weary of jumping in. When it works, it is beautiful, but when it crashes you are abandoned and without support or help.... Make your decision."
4,It works very well,"Well I plugged it in, did the confguration. Made no changes (dhCP both sides) for frontier / Global Croswssing. and it works. The onlything is when I power up the first tiem I MUSt do a reboot for the computer I am loggning in from the be able to access the web. it tracert's and eveything else but needs a reboot to web. over all the device is excellent. I think it might be a DhcP thing and restart resets it. Way to go Linksys and amazon for making it so cheap. Happy puppy. I just wish they made and 8 port version."
2,DO NOT UPGRADE THE FIRMWARE!!!!!!!!!!,"This is my first router EVER, and I thought it would be my last... I got this over a year ago and it started out working just fine, then over time It started to drop connections(during heavy loads) and constantly needed to rebooted due to speeds dropping. I decided to update the firmware and it bricked!!! After some research, I saw that this was a problem with many others as well. I tried every suggested option for ""de-bricking"" my device to no avail... It may not have worked with day 1 finesse after 5-6 months(lets face it stuff wears out) but it at least worked. I thought updates were supposed to make the product better, not destroy it... The upnp also crapped out after a few months and the DMZ function didn't work either... Heck, the port forwarding was also busted... This router sucked!!"
2,missing power cord,"wasn't clear that i needed the power cord, i tried to find one to fit it, but no luck. dont use it. waste of money"
4,good realible router,I've always had good luck with linksys routers. So I picked up this one to replace my 12yr old linksys that went out on me. So far this one works with no issues.
1,Worst product ever purchased,I have spent many hours trying this to work with my DSL. Continuously disconnects. What a complete waste of $101.46! I will never purchase a Cisco product again. I regret purchasing this.
2,Poor technical support,"I purchased a BEFSR41 in December 2000. To date I have yet been able to talk with a rep at linksys technical service. If I do succeed at getting through voice mail an operator takes my name and number and tells me that a tech person will return my call. To date, nobody has ever returned my calls. The unit works but locks up every 30 minutes when used with internet tunneling s/w. Uploaded 1.37 and problem still exists. Not a good experience."
1,Buy This If You Like Hitting the Reset Button,"I bought this router and everything seemed to work fine at first. Then I started noticing that things just stopped working. None of my computers could get to the Internet. So, I hit the ""Reset"" button on the router and everything appeared to be working again..until the next day.To make a long story short, it seemed like everyday I had to hit the ""Reset"" button and the router eventually stopped working altogether. Frustrated, I bought the equivalent router from Netgear and have never had a problem since.Hope this helps you avoid my mistakes. Do yourself a favor and go with NetGear right off the bat."
4,Good features at a good price,"This is an easy to install and maintain component. The DHCP server is more than adequate for home or small office use and the ability to allocate one of the enet ports to the public side of the firewall is very nice. If you are going to use VPN you need to make sure you have the latest software upgrade from their website and you need to activate IPSec passthru. I find it a little buggy with my wireless home network, though. But a quick IPO reset and it's working again."
1,The router that eats connections,"I had an internet connection, this router chewed it up and demolished it, am returning it now. The set-up disk would never get beyond 99% complete, the PC could never detect the device, we plugged the old router back in and lo and behold I am here returning my product and reviewing the crap I'm sending back. It even came dusty out of the box, how messed up is that?"
1,Very Disappointed With Product,"Linksys EtherFast Cable/DSL Router with 4-Port 10/100 Switch (BEFSR41)We have had to replace this product twice in one year, so naturally we now have a different router. We read the customer reviews, and went with D-Link.Isn't it amazing though, how it works so well--Linsys--for some people, and not others? My daughter has had hers for 2 years with no problems. Could it be that we bought it from Wal-Mart, and maybe it's factory seconds that they sell? Just a thought."
2,A Hassle,"Something is wrong with the DHCP on this thing - I keep getting IP address conflicts. Fails 2 or 3 times a month. You can't reset it through a browser, you just have to unplug it. It's a real annoyance."
1,cable/DSL Router,"There should be a Zero Catagory for this review. The Router did not work at all. It just sat there and blinked at me. I had to go to Wal-Mart and bought one cheaper and one that works great. Did not return router as my dogs chewed up the box it came in, but if you actually read this and want to do something about it, please let me know. I certainly will not buy anything else from you if you do not.Virginia H St Pierre"
1,Drops connections with moderate usage; requires frequent hard reboots,"Any router that needs to be re-booted as frequently as this one should have a conveniently located power switch. I'm pulling the power cable in and out of this thing all day, and I'm not gaming, using extensive P2P or anything out of the ordinary. Uses a web interface to make updates, changes, connections, etc -- problem is that the graphic which is used for the different functions FREQUENTLY won't load (?!) ""Customer service"" from Linksys ranges from disinterest to ridicule. AVOID."
1,"Useless, and a lousy website.","Bought this to replace a D-Link router that is getting flaky and spent an entire frustrating afternoon with it. IP obtained, no network capability. Updated the firmware even, no help. The website offered advice on resolving that in no way matched any software either available on the website, or the software that came with the product. Finally I plugged back in my D-Link and am temporarily back in business - will look elsewhere for a solution. At least the D-link came with understandable software and a website that is comprehensible."
5,Work's Great with Cox Cable,"Was able to make a static Ip address with this item and use DHCP to run four computer's, on the net, at the same time. Adding switch(8 port) to use uplink. I am sure it will do the same job. If you have cable, grab one of these fast. It does not give you a log on hits to your firewall, but I do not need to see it. I just want it to work and it does. Very well made and a great price."
2,"Linksys ineffective as speed champ, VPN solution","Although router is execellent 10/100 switch and sets up FAST, routing capbilities are not very quick (they appear BUFFERED, so if you do on-line gaming, try something else) and forget about slick things like VPN logins to other sites.Unfortunately, that's all I needed, so back this goes... :(Although the web interface is convenient, it is buggy under both IE 5 and Netscape (most flavors). Even after bios upgrades on the router, I still could NOT apply changes to some of the advanced sections of the configuration web server. Shame!Tech support from Linksys is also sub-standard, I waited 40 minutes on their tech line and never got my problems resolved.I may buy their switch, however, as the switch operation was great, as was the DHCP server included."
1,Faulty product -- again,"This is the second product that the seller sent me. The first router was faulty (verified by Linksys), so I mailed it back (I paid for return mailing charges). The seller sent me a second product. Again, it didn't work (verified by Linksys). I'm not sure if they just laughed and sent the exact same router back to me, or if all of the products they got from Cisco are bad. I again have to pay to mail it back. I will be requesting a full refund. I will never use this seller again."
5,Nice router,This a a GREAT product if you want to network up to four computers on a DSL or Cable modem. GREAT customer support from Cisco / Linksys. I prefer using an ethernet cable and hard wiring versus wireless but that is me. Perfect for this job.
4,"Easy setup, performance is very good","I have two networked PC's, a printer, and Verizon Expander as well as a laptop and Xbox 360. I currently use the Linksys WRT54GL Wireless G router without problems. But I needed more than four ports to use DirectTV's Video on Demand and allow for expansion. I purchased this product to place in front of the wireless router. The setup required some searching on Linksys's support site to get the connections and setup correct. I placed the Ethernet cable from the RoadRunner modem into this router. Port 1 cable went to Port 1 of the Wireless Router. Port 2 & 3 for the PC's, port 4 for the printer. Port 2 on the Wireless Router for the Expander, Port 3 for the DirectTV and Port 4 available. After getting everything setup, it has worked perfectly. I did have a problem with the CD included for installation but like I said, the support site provided the needed information."
5,Linksys BEFSR41,This is the best of the low priced router's on the market. Only comparable to similar d-link models. Quickly sets up with included CD Rom. Talks you through step by step. Perfect for the newbie setting up their first home or small biz network. Easily configurable for more technical users through a web browser interface. Comes with built in hardware firewall making up for lack of icluded software firewall. There is a link for a low priced 4 user license of Zonelab 3.0 and Pc Cillin 2000 anti virus software.
5,Great Econo Router,This is the best router for your money. I do net working on the side and have never had one customer call with any complaint. Easy to set up with some knowledge of the equipment. It is almost plug n play.
5,"For Windows XP, Windows 2000, using a cable modem","This router required ""NO"" configuration to get it up and running on two laptops, already using a cable modem, running both Windows XP & Windows 2000, plus an existing corporate VPN client. It is a fantastic, easy to use, powerful piece of technology. I'll be programming the built-in firewall soon, plus exploring this routers other great features. If you are already using a cable modem, and a supported OS, you will love this gizmo! Good luck!!!!!"
5,Exceeded My Expectations,"In a word: Wow. Installed in minutes. Configured in minutes. All totaled, less than an hour, and most of that was running and organizing the cables into the back of a cabinet where it is installed. This replaces a WebRamp dial-on-demand device, so my premise wiring was already in place. I'm thoroughly impressed; it couldn't be easier to share the broadband connection."
5,Excellent little piece of equipment.,"Definitely a must if you have DSL or cable and more than 1 computer. This unit does NAT (network address translation), basic firewalling, and will allow VPN access out.I have had mine for a while and love it. Definitely the best DSL router on the market. (IMHO)"
5,basically flawless,"Opened the box, connected to a pc and a mac and in about 15 minutes had everything running great. As someone else pointed out, I didnt expect the mac to connect easily but I just turned on DHCP and restarted and that was it.So far a solid product that performs exactly as expected."
5,GREAT product!,This is the perfect cost-effective solution to simple home networking/internet connection sharing. Setting it up with the simple on screen directions left no room for error.
5,Works for me...,I waited to review this item to see if it had longevity. It hasbeen working perfectly now for 9 months. Set up was easy: makethe connections to the ethernet cards in the computers and tothe DSL Modem and then tell the DSL Router the login andpassword to the DSL service. All the defaults in the DSL Routerworked fine for my set-up.
5,Easy set up and administration,"Yes, it does have great looks. However, what I found more attractive was how easy it was to setup right out of the box. Even though I was connecting a single boot Windows XP and a dual-boot Win 2000/Red Hat 7.2 machine, setup was no problem.Administering the unit is as easy as opening up a browser and typing in the unit's IP address. What you'll like in this feature is that while it allows expert users to configure advanced settings, newbies will not have any problem setting up the router for regular day-to-day operations including not only surfing but sharing files, printers etc. I'm actually thinking of extending this with the Wireless version of this router. That way, I can have wireless internet access on a laptop throughout my house!Since we are going into the age of multiple computers in every house with a broadband connection, this is a must have."
2,"Good Product, Terrible customer service","I have used this router for about a year and love it. The thing is that once it had a problem, getting in touch with their customer service and getting action taken is where the problems start. I have read many reports about how bad their customer service and technical support are and ignored them. I would think twice about buying this product again due to how bad they treat you or if you are lucky treat you at all."
4,Works Great But Sounds Annoying,"This router worked great for me right out of the box with no changes to the built-in configuration options. My Internet connection seems just as speedy as before, and I feel secured by the built-in network protection.I have one problem with it, though. It produces an annoying high-pitched electronic buzz. It's not audible when my computer is on contributing its own noise to the room. But when the computer is off, the whine can be annoying. I've tried several, and they all produce this noise. It would be completely forgivable if it was going in a network closet. But the four-legged unit was clearly made for the desktop."
4,Not a simple install,"I set up a Linksys 4-port router and I am extremely pleased. It is fast, fast, fast! However, I too have DSL from a provider that supports PPPoE and let me tell you, it pays to have friends who know network architecture! I am a programmer but a mere developer is no match for this baby. I worked with Linksys online support and the tech told me the router was defective, and to send it back to Amazon. I didn't believe him, and my tech friend didn't either. Ten minutes on the phone and we had it up and running, set to fixed IP addresses for my PCs (not DHCP). Once its up and running, it is a brave new world. I would rate it 5 stars if mere mortals could install it."
5,Linksys easy router set up is GREAT 5 minutes!!,I just installed the 4 port linksys and it is the easiest piece of hardware I have ever put in!!! If you are going to use DHCP it is already programmed. My PC came up already connected to to ISP and I didnt have to go thru the programming. ( I did anyway just so I would know what was going on) The 3 other PCs in my house came up just as easy. This is a great inprovement over MS Internet Connection Sharing software and a hub that I was using before. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to share PCs over a cable connection.
5,Excellent product,"This is truly a great product. I have run proxy servers in the past to share my broadband, and it was always a headache. I purchased this product and have not had any problems. It was easy to install and set up, and it is very expandable. I have added their 2 port printserver, and several hubs, again without any trouble. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to share their broadband connection, this product is perfect for both the new computer user and the experienced professional."
4,so far so good!,very easy to configure. very straight forward. the only thing that scares me is some of the reviews regarding support--but since it was so easy to setup I don't think they could really help me if I needed it...
5,Easy Installation,"While I have a strong electronic background, I am just slightly dangerous when it comes to computers. This installation was as pain-free as anything I have installed on a computer. I kept thinking that I was missing something somewhere. My installation took about 15 minutes and everything works great.The only hitch I found was that the quick installation instructions do not mention PPoE setup for an ADSL connection. A quick look at the full instructions provided the answers.And yes... It is a version 2, not a version 1!"
5,Flawless,"Bought this up to use a Mac and a PC on a newly installed cable modem using only the single IP address supplied with the modem. Took less than 10 minutes from box to up and running with both machines. Highly recommended if you, like us, have not yet made the leap to wireless."
5,"I am running 7 PCs on it, with no problems.","I have been running seven PCs on this, using an extra four port switch to expand it...It has been running nicely. It has been a faithful servant for over a year....I had to futz with it a bit a while ago because of some interference problem that ended when I moved it away from the huge monitor I have.If you don't what to learn how to set up a router, then give away all your computers because you don't want to learn anything about them. Like everything worth while, it takes a bit of work on your part to be successful."
5,Plug and Play simplicity,I'm a network administrator and was looking for a product that I could recommend to my end-users who are adding broadband to their homes so that they can utilize our corporate VPN. This product is the ticket. Plug and Play simplicty. Thing works perfectly out of the box and with a very simple configuration allows VPN traffic to flow. Only let-down is that it only allows one VPN tunnel through the firewall at a time. But in most cases that's not a big problem. I love this thing and recommend it wholeheartedly.
2,MSN messenger voice and file transfer limitation,"I loved this router until I discovered its limitation. Firmware version 1.38 does not allow MSN voice and file transfer. Upgrading it to version 1.39 which addresses that problem seems to be impossible. I had to buy another one for that purpose. So far MSN voice and file transfer work only when I fully open the firewall through DMZ. Port Forwarding does not do the job and Linksys support seems to be giving up on that issue. . . However, everything else works fine for my needs"
5,Works Great!,Install was quick and easy and worked well with my Road Runner Cable modem. I am running web/ftp/pcAnywhere services on one of my machines and the forwarding feature works great. I was a little concerned that I might have problems with my PPTP VPN connection to work but it also worked through the Linksys without a problem.
4,"Good product, bad documentation","You should definitely buy this router, but don't rely on the documentation to help you get it up and running."
4,Hassle free setup.,"This router/switch was easy to setup and the firewall functionality has been so good that after a few months I uninstalled BlackICE (my software firewall).The only complaint that I have is the unit has recently developed a bad switch port. Fortunately, I only need three ports."
4,Good for Sharing A Broadband internet connection,"This is a good product for sharing my ATT BROADBAND CABLE MODEM CONNECTION. I think this product was worth while. Set up would have been easy if I had all the right information in the first place. However, I didn't, but when I downloaded the latest firmware upgrade, and cloned my MAC address to fool my isp, it worked like a charm."
4,Not for beginners,"This is a neat little box, but it is not for beginners. If you don't understand networks and DSL, you'll find it frustrating to use. If you are an expert, it probably deserves five stars for price/performance. If you are an consumer with no particular technical savvy, the rating falls dramatically.I never bothered to contact Linksys's customer support, but other reviewers' complaints have the ring of truth. To further complicate matters, your DSL service provider may be less than terrific. In San Francisco, for instance, PacBell is lousy.If your confidence level is high, buy this. Otherwise, you may want to wait until the technology improves. DSL today is like the internet was in 1995."
1,Bad News,"Not at all easy to install or use. There are many, many options which you have no access to through the installation CD. There is a web interface for setting options, but the address is nowhere to be found in the documentation. You have to hunt through the Linksys web site to find it. Then go through tons of Linksys FAQs to find information for the different settings and what to do if things go wrong.After hours and hours of investigation and setting different options and going through technical support, my internet connection was still slow and constantly breaking off. Definitely not a good product."
1,Non-Deloivery of Purchased Item,"Your records may indicate that i never received the above item.Luckily, it wasn't an expensive item.It's the first time Amazon has ever let me down.Ah Well,Larry"
5,Lynksys Router Works Fine,The Linksys DSL Router BEFSR41 that I purchased from Amazon has proved to be a reliable product and welcome addition to my PC security system. I would recommend having a Tech person install it though to make sure that all connections and interfaces are working properly.
4,Linksys BEFSR 41 DSL Router,This product is working fine. I found the best price from Amazon. Shipment was prompt. I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 because everybody needs to have room for improvement. Thank Amazon RCR from North Carolina
4,So Far So Good,"After reading many good and bad reviews,I bought this item.Thesetup was fairly easy.I have a cable modem.I was unsure if I hadto call Cable Co. for some info as mentioned in directions.ButI was fairly sure the ISP's were issued radomly,DHCP I guess.Idon't hear any hums,running cool.I'm looking for a program to test my firewall.I have one P.C. connected."
1,Broken product,"The directions are clear and understandable. I work in technology and could not get it to work. After waiting 30 mins for tech support, I was told that it was ""probably"" defective and to return it. Now, I get to go through the joys of returning something to Amazon."
5,Inexpensive and simple.,"It's great!It took me 30 minutes to get it set up with my three computer network, and half of that was because I was trying to use the wrong cable to connect my DSL modem to the Linksys (the modem wants a cross-over cable, I was using a regular one). Now I share the internet with three computers, have a home network for sharing files, am protected against internet intrusion. Couldn't ask for more. The simplest set-up I have seen. The documentation seems fine, with a one-page quick-start insert that explains everything. I didn't need to use tech support."
4,Linksys router/hub for DSL,"The total time from unpacking to completed installation was about one hour. Easy to use and setup. Compact design so does not take up a lot of space. The instructions (yes, I read them!) are easy to understand and follow. If you have any strange setup requirements, they are either convered in the manual or on the Linksys web site.It is a pity that they do not include a cable to connect between the modem and the router."
5,Worth every penny,It occupies less space. But it has varieties of work outs for different muscles. I never liked bowflex as i wouldn't feel my muscle working much. I strongly recommend anyone to buy this.
4,Great little gym,"Easy to use, easy to build, compact and super functional. I highly recommend this product!"
5,Just like being at the gym!,"We are extremely satisfied with the home gym. It is easy to use and very sturdy. My sister, a physical therapist, inspected this home gym and was quite pleased. She showed us the many different types of strengthening exercises that can be done with this home gym that are not included in the chart. The entire family is getting tone and fit. It took my son and his friend, age 16, about three to four hours to put it together. Great product. Well worth the money and required assembling time. Also, the gym was delivered way before the expected delivery date, which was very exciting!"
3,Decent machine,"I purchased this gym so my two boys in Jr. High could work out with me. The delivery was quick. It took me a few hours to put together and I didn't have any problems. The machine is smooth and provides a decent workout. I am not to crazy about the leg attachment. This machine is NOT for a person who is above average size. When you sit in the seat to do pull downs there is not a whole lot of room. I am using this machine to stay in shape. If your looking for a machine to have serious workouts, not sure this is it. This machine works well for me and my two boys."
5,HENKLES 6 INCH CHEF KNIFE,"THIS KNIFE IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY!THE KNIFE IS VERY WELL MADE WITH A TANG ( THE LENGTH OF STEEL )THAT GOES ALL THE WAY TO THE END OF THE HANDLE . THE BALANCE IS PERFECT AND IT FITS WELL IN THE HAND.RIVETS KEEP EVERYTHING IN PLACE .IT NEEDS A LITLLE MORE MAINTAINANCE THAN OTHER KNIVES I HAVE USED ...MUST BE SHARPENED EVERY TIME I USE IT AND WASHED RIGHT AWAY TO KEEP THE BLADE SHINNY, BUT IT'S AWAYS MAKES THE JOB EASIER TO COMPLETE .THIS KNIFE WILL BE A GREAT ADDITION TO A CHEF'S COLLECTION OR THE PERFECT STARTER KNIFE FOR A NEW COOK."
4,Jag -- takes off with full afterburner.,"really good potential start of the show. Good plot and good cast. As an aviation fan (my father flew sailplanes) I really enjoyed the visual and the flight scenes. Some of them looked as if they'd been ""clipped"" from Top Gun (hence the description of the title?) I was also looking for a show that my father might enjoy, as Star Trek seems to have been completely removed from the cable feed (this is, except for ""Classic"" which is on once a week.)"
3,JAG,Great - would like to see more TV series put out covering their various seasons....how about Star Trek and Hill Street Blues
5,JAG - the complete first season,A great tv series that kept you waiting for the next installment. A must for a collection.
5,JAG - The Complete First Season,"Since I didn't start watching JAG until 2001, I was very excited to see the first season in order of appearance with episodes that I had missed and never seen in reruns. Excellent buy if you are a fan of JAG!"
4,JAG - The complete 1st Season,"I had forgotten the beginnings of this show and could not put the DVD's away. Suddenly all the characters and how they where introduced to the show made sense. Plenty of David James Elliott which always makes a show enjoyable and special features that showed how it all started with the writer / director. Blooopers would have been great ( Not included tho ) but maybe that is something to look forward to in another series, after all I am sure David has a wicked sense of humour. Will be purchasing more and recommend it to anyone who loves this style of TV drama."
3,Finding its legs,"Thank God NBC canceled this show and CBS picked it up realizing its potential. This really was a season of not knowing which way it wanted to go. I thought there were some good episodes but for the most part this series didn't really pick up until the 2nd season when it was made more like a law and order show via the military. Plus Catherine Bell was a huge edition to the show. I know there is a lot of fan support for Andrea Parker and I liked her but she didn't come close to the chemistry that Bell had with Elliot. All in all I think it's a good price for this first season, it was the kind of season all new shows seem to go through as they try to find their legs."
4,Great stories - Some Poor Video Quality!!!!,"The first season has some great stories which would normally earn the dvd collection a 5 star rating. PROBLEM: Did anyone notice the the poor video quality on a number of episodes when the background is dark at night? I was hoping that maybe I just got a bad dvd, but the poor video background occurs on several dvds. This is an inexcusable lack of professional effort by the video engineers. However, this did not prevent me from acquiring the following eight seasons of JAG on dvd.Did someone experience excellent video quality throughout all the episodes on the first season? Please let me know.Wesley TomRedlands, CA[...]"
5,JAG: season 1,"I got hooked on JAG after they were off the air, and I'm sorry I didn't see the show while they were on the air. This is a wonderful series. I'm glad I purchased this. Looking forward to buying Season 2."
3,jag above and below,"the first season had its up and downs. the pairing harm and meg was not a good combo. she was to weak in some episodes and somewhat strong in others. the teaming of harm and mac the next season help save the show. the adding of bud, harriet and the admirial provided a key element in the way they interacted with each other and having humor mixed in added a key addition to each episode."
5,JAG,"We have been JAG fans for years! The DVD cannot come out soon enough. I do have a comment for the producers and writers, though. You should have told us that the last episode of the season was its last. It was most unfair to us JAG fans who have been faithfully following this series for years to leave us high and dry as to what happened after the last episode when the final season ended. When the final episode was shown, there was no ""closure"" or ""resolution"", making us believe that there will be another JAG season.Anyway, I am so happy that we will be able to see JAG again and I do hope that you will have DVDs, not just for the lst season but for the rest of the seasons."
5,HARM & MAC - My decision in life,Thank you for this wonderful series. I started watching from the beginning....and after three years I decided I wanted to change my life for the better. Thank you Donald Bellisario...a great job!
4,First Season Harvests Both Good and Bad Fruit,"The following review was given by my husband who this was for:Good show, some subject matter left a little to be desired.Too many sexual innuendos with Harm and another attorney.BUT...all in all action is good, good story line, has a lot of interesting episodes that I like, but I dont like the cliffhanger at the end of the dvd. I wish that the ending had been provided instead of having to wait for 6 months for the 2nd season. Good sound, good picture control. I watch it over and over again.VIEWERS BEWARE: Some subject matter are inappropriate for younger children."
3,jag season 1,Well after watching JAG on HDNet I had to start from the begining. Well when I saw the first episode I can see why NBC wanted to dump it. It was one of the worst things I've seen. The Head of JAG made this seem like a comedy. The filming with the backdrops was bad. Now around episode 4 it started to get better. Then the screw up where Rabb was LtCmdr. and the next back to Lt. Finally towards the end of the season things were going well. Now the big screw up on the last episode when we see Harm being arrested and no ending.
4,A Great Action Drama,I have watched the first disc and so far its been great! I'm already hooked. I have seen some of the 2nd season-10 on USA but wanted to catch up and the first season is well done!!
4,Entertaining,"Entertaining book describing how nursery rhymes, etc. have historical references. I enjoyed reading it and passed it along to others to read as well."
4,Heavy Words Lightly Thrown,"Heavy Words Lightly Thrown By Chris Roberts.Paperback 185 Pages.This collection is not intended for children.This collection of rhymes was researched as far as was possible( by a librarian with a history degree.) not an easy job, but the fact that considerable effort was made to unravel the facts was good enough for me.I knew there were hidden meanings to the rhymes because of my work and interest in child - care. I was very pleased when I found this book, as topics like these are not easy to find.It is not pollitically correct, if it had been I probably would not have bought it. I am very fond of this quirky paperback. I found the history fascinating, (both English and American versions of the rhymes are given) when available. The short histories allow the reader to peruse at leisure and with pleasure, returning again and again."
2,Sounds Fascinating! But it's not.,"Who wouldn't love to know the history behind those beloved nursery rhymes? Me, it turns out, when the story deals with the Fourth Earl of Cheesebury and his feud with Lord Snot over something that wasn't even very important at the time it happened - a tale that is lovingly told in the driest language possible in an effort to completely avoid the possibility of entertaining the reader."
3,Light on Reason,"This book depended too much on supposition. Rather than telling us the reason behind the rhyme, too frequently he told us several ways it might have been. This was musing more than fact finding."
2,Not What I Anticipated,"I'm very interested in the origin of nursery rhymes, and was therefore not at all enthralled by this book. Almost from the first page, my enthusiasm began to wane; after a couple chapters I became downright bored. The author demonstrates that he is very knowledgeable, but never quite ties his observations of history directly to the nursery rhyme being discussed. The title is the most interesting line of the book. Sorry to say this was quite a disappointing reading experience for me."
3,Big expensive textbook,"The only reason this book got 3 stars instead of 5 is because, like most textbooks, this is way too expensive for what you get. It is a huge book, but we all know we can't sell them back for nearly what we pay for them! Why do they have to charge SO MUCH?"
5,Truly an essentials book,"Obviously this was written with the consumer in mind. Such a tiny book, but still packs the punch for stategy in management planning on all levels. Industry examples well written"
2,Nowhere near as good as genuine Wusthof or Henckels...,"I recently got this set and the 2 piece carving set of the same series. I know I should not have expected much for this great price, but the knives do not have anywhere as good a feel as the classic line of wusthof or the henckels 4 or 5 star knives. They are very light in weight, mostly due to the handles. Much better than a target or kmart knife, and great to start, but I expect to switch mine out with 'real' knives as my budget will allow."
4,IT is what it is,"I am a professional chef and while I use better knives at work, these are great for the beginner or for doing light work at home.These knives are designed to sharpened by a sharpening steel but they tend to need it less often then your average knife.Its a cheap knife that you dont mind dinging up or using on frozen product when necessary.The redesign is also great considering that the old version of the Eversharp would at times flip overand stand upright with its cutting edge straight up! That's a dangerous flaw which has been since rectified.Its a good started product and you can eventually work your way up to a F.Dicks or GLOBAL product as you become more seasoned."
2,knife review,"Looked great, was not the sharpest knife I've used.. cuts fair, not great.. would not recommend this item ..packaging was great, knives were a bit heavy"
2,Great Value,This is a great value. You can spend your time and look around but this is the best you will find for the money. The knifes cut like butter.
3,Great!!!,This is fun to read all the slang from now then and in between. Funny how as much as things change most stay the same.
4,In the Garden with Tajalli,"This CD was the loving product of Tajalli's wisened soul. Garden of the Goddess is all things beautiful, playful and relaxing. He is one of those musicians whose music perfectly matched his personality, and that oneness is apparent in this collection. A unique bit of island flavor in the tracks makes this album stand out from other New Age stylings...perfect to warm you up this winter."
2,CENSORED AGAIN,"I have just confirmed that unfortunately, this set has the same re-dubbed cartoons as the previous version. So the only new material is the rest of ""What's New Mr. Magoo""."
4,Michael,"Without Mr Magoo, there would be no Mr Bean. Jim Backus is a genius and deserves to be remembered as a Gladiator amongst TV giants. He is a peoples champion."
3,1/2 and 1/2,As in the other release of the Mr Magoo show ep 17 is the killer I believe .But other then that having nice new dvd's of the famous adventures of Mr Magoo(I believe only on vhs before) and Uncle Sam Magoo (which was on DVD before) AndWhat's New Mr Magoo in show format is nice (but that has been out on dvd before)Sadly pc Charlie on the last 9 eps or so is here to stay
5,These bar & cookie recipes have it all!,"Wonderful conglomeration of ethnic and contemporary recipes that are a delight to the eye and taste bud. This book is easy to follow, very good hints on freezing and mailing for every recipe."
5,Awesome product!,I've been using this for a couple of years now. I'm 34 yrs old and don't have any wrinkles around my eyes. A few friends have asked me how it's possible that I have no signs of wrinkles around my eyes and I tell them about this product. It's wonderful. It feels great and smells even better. I love it. Kiss my face organic eyewitness is a staple in my daily routine.
5,Awesome and urgent treatise on the future of life.,"The question that Edward O. Wilson sets out to address is possibly the most important we have ever faced: ""Are we entering a critical period in our biological and ecological history, from which we may never emerge?""`The Future of Life' is Wilson's most urgent, inspiring and intellectually nourishing books to date. It is a compelling call to arms to avert the global extinction episode that we are currently in the midst of. Our current mode may rival the one that wiped out the dinosaurs 60 million years ago-without the need of any single catastrophic event to help it along.This volume is destined to go down as one of the most important books of far-seeing cautionary discussion, much as Rachel Carson's `Silent Spring' did a generation or two ago. Highly recommended."
3,The Don Quijote of biodiversity,"Although its quite clearly a thoughtful analysis, I could not see Wilson's recommendations as realistic. Wilson catalogs some of the more successful environmental programs, but it seems like the effort to preserve biodiversity is a losing, desperate struggle. Not for those with a pessimistic bent, because Wilson gives plenty of reasons to despair for the natural environment."
3,For biologist,Unfortunately this book was a little over my head. The book started off with a good point on extinction but then started to get into biological terms that made me lose my interested in the point the author was trying to make.I think this book would be a good read for individuals that want to understand the future of life for species.Enjoy the read.
3,The Future of Life Book Review,"The title The Future of Life is a good book because it makes predictions of the future based on what is happening now. He describes the Earth as one big organism that has to coperate with all the cordinating ecosystems to survive. Humans have created the ""bottleneck theory"" where we havecontinually destroyed ecosystems and extinguished species. We as humans are using up all the natural resourses and in the long run, we are hurting ourselves. E.O. wilson uses the book as a ""call to action"" for humans to change their wars before it is too late and our planet earth is destroyed forever.Overall, it was a pretty good book. Wilson uses good examples in outlining how we can help improve Earth. He was a tad too pessimistis though. He blamed everything on humans. THere were alot of facts that mad it boring and it got a little redundant towards the end of the novel. The Future of life was an interesting read. There was a lot of interesting information in it."
3,"The Future of Life, boring yet informative","Overal the author made several important points. He believes the biodiviersy of earth is decreasing and htis is having an important impact on hte environment. THe population is growing at expodential rate and eventually the worlds recources are running out. Although htis book is boring, somthing does need to be done to save our environment.I recoment htis book to all who have any feelings for the earth itself."
4,Future of Life,"This book was quite a fun read. It provides a lot of information on the things that have happened in the past, the current status of the environment, and what we need to do in order to save or precious planet. Highly recommended to those interested in conservation."
1,Not Worth the purchase price,"This is completely over priced. Your average reader will get more out of something like ""Prince 2 for Dummies"". I was verydisapointed that this book offered so little, When the title offered so much. A Waste total of Money"
2,"Not very well written, probably copied from white papers!","Badly presented, layout terrible, far to expensive"
5,A great product for the money,"These steak knives are great! They cut all kinds of meats easily and smoothly. I disagree with the other reviewer. These knives are made of stainless steel, but all steel as it ages will develop some rust/aging. Be sure to hand wash and towel dry the knives, and they will last a long time. Right now these are hard to find. I hope they continue to make and sell them, as I would like to add more to my set."
3,The Handles Leave Something to be Desired,"Purchased two sets of these knives as replacements for the SAME that had worn out from use. While the blades themselves are of the same quality, there is something off about the handle material. it looks a bit beat up and even with handwashing, it isn't looking so good. However, the knives themselves are of great quality and are perfect if you like edges that aren't TOO serrated."
4,Don't make my mistake,"I purchased this pan because I am wanting to make my own bread but wanted a long pan to make longer loafs. I bought this pan since it was the longest at 11 inches. Well that includes the handles this pan only makes loaves that are about 8.5-9 inches long. I have used it a few times and is very easy to use and clean, I was just disappointed at the size."
5,"BLACKFOOT, IT BEGINS","TO CORRECT THE REVIEW ABOVE THE SONGS WERE WRITIN' BY SPIRES AND RICKY MEDLOCKE. THERE WAS A LEGAL ISSUE WITH SKYNYRD'S MANAGEMENT THAT WAS EASY TO SOLVE BY PUTTING JUST SPIRES NAME.(CHECK MY REVIEW ON SKYNYRD'S FIRST AND LAST FOR MORE DETAILS ON THAT.)THIS WAS A GREAT DEBUT BY BLACKFOOT AND IT'S RELEASED ON CD AFTER ALMOST 30 YEARS. LP'S FOR THE ALBUM WERE SELLING FOR 300$ ON EBAY AND OTHER SITES. MAIN SONGS OF INTEREST ARE RAILROAD MAN,BORN TO ROCK N' ROLL,BIG WHEELS,I STAND ALONE. NOT THEIR BEST BUT A GOOD ALBUM, WORTH HAVING."
3,SOME RESERVATION,This album is good but i do not think that its as good as STRIKES. Blackfoot have begun to start to perfect their sound but the tracks are not that memorable.
5,3 years and still going,"i have taken this book to me 3 years in a row that i've gone to yellowstone, and it has shown me where the fish are. This is the best fly-fishing guide i have ever seen. If you plan on fly-fishing Yellowstone seriously i highly reccomend this book."
3,"Good for basic stream location, very dated","This is a good book for providing basic information about stream location. It does a good job helping you to locate all of the various streams in the park, however as with any book it has become dated and there are some name changes that have been made in the park that are obviously not going to be documented in the book. As with any fly fishing the best way to get current information about what to fish with and what kinds of fish are in an area, is to stop by a couple of the local fly shops."
3,Still needs some work,"While the unit does deliver external storage at wire rates, there are a few flaws. First, if you're a Win2K user, you won't be able to use your fully qualified user name (e.g. Joseph.Doe) because the user names have the Unix (Linux) limitations. This means you have to map your drive as another user. Also, the unit is quite noisy, so don't plan on having it anywhere in which peace and quiet are important."
2,Doesn't hold air,"When fully inflated, it works well. But, when you have to stop and blow it up every time you are ready to use it because it deflates, kind of interrupts the mood."
2,Good to use one single time,Nice idea but was leaking air after we use for the first time.maybe is made in china :) I just want my money back....
1,Second Pipedreams bad product in one day!,The d**n thing did not inflate - I tried two pumps and mouth. It's like the valve is sealed!DON'T BUY PIPEDREAMS STUFF!!!!
4,Postion Master,"Position master was very good. Does not work on the bed well, but excellent on the floor. I would recommend it to other couples."
1,Mindless Chatter,"Save yourself some time and money: simply jot down some words, incoherently, on the nearest piece of scrap paper and you will have recreated this piece in its entirety."
5,"Niklas Eklund, world class baroque trumpeter","Niklas Eklund demonstrates the superiority of the baroque trumpet in this medium with this incredible recording of some of the most difficult and favorite baroque trumpet literature. He is without a doubt one of the finest virtuoso artists of our time. His playing and interpretations are wonderful, and the beauty of his sound and authentic baroque concepts present a fresh and welcome addition to the trumpet repetoire. Bravo to Eklund for a recording of unprecedented quality and ability. It is sure to become the new standard of baroque trumpet playing."
4,Art of Baroque Trumpet Vol.4,"Art of Baroque Trumpet Vol.4 is another fine recording in Eklunds series of Baroque trumpet recordings. On this recording we get to hear Joseph Arnold Gross, Michael Haydn, Johann Melchior Molter, Johan Wilhelm Hertel, Georg Philipp Telemann and George Friedrich Händel. I love Baroque music and Eklund's performance is superb. Recommended. 4/5."
2,"Good picture, but bulbs burn out too fast","I have had this projector for a little over a year now. My third bulb has just burned out. Don't expect to get anywhere near the advertised lifespan on your lamp. Around 800 hours is the lifespan of the bulb, and each one costs over $250. So think about it carefully. If you plan on using a projector every day, this one will cost you at least $500 / year in bulb replacements."
4,Good Book That Lacked Follow-Up on Stories,"I found this book to be an insightful read. I always knew that actors led dysfunctional lives, but this is too much. This is the vermin that society looks up to? That says a lot about where we are as a society. Reading the books certainly makes me dislike some of these characters in Hollywood. Now that the election has passed I dislike these actors even more because who are they to be influencing people's vote? And Arnold is Governor, what a joke!I wish the book would have had better follow ups on lawsuits and other complaints on these so-called stars. I can only imagine what really happens in Hollywood that Ms. Amede does not know about. She hasn't gone to same sex celebrity orgies and other disgusting activities that only happen in Hollywood.As they say, beauty is only skin deep and all that glitters is not gold. I can see Hollywood is called Tinseltown. Just look up your dictionary if you do not know what the word tinsel means."
2,"Rather tame information for such a ""confidential"" book.",The book was not exactly what it represented itself to be. The format looked thrown together and the information itself was quite weak. I do not recommend this book to anyone who craves real Hollywood insight
5,Entertaining / Challenging,"Altough very easy to read and appears to be simplistic, it's a challenge if you let it be!With one short 1-2 line average saying on each page, it's a quick read. But it is not t typical book of instruction, it's a puzzle if you allow it to be... and then the fun starts!I spent hours and hours (and I consdier mself t have some bit of expansion and debth in me...) but hours just thiking about a few of them, tring to figure out what they meant and if my thoughts were the same as in zen... a few, wow, tough, but I did get the all eventually!I was told when I bought it that you cold think/concentrate ona dilima or worry etc., and when you have fully filled yor mind and heart with that question, the answer will be on the page you blindly open the book to.... really! It could not be a total mistake in that it seemded to work every time, the sayings were right on the target as to my day's or moments expeirnce to far. And I am not sure if it was my mistake"
5,Great for reading and as a reference guide,Very complete and illustrating. I am happy to have it on my desktop.
5,A great book if you are serious about SQL Server,The most comprehensive reference I have seen. I especially appreciate the thorough treatment of relational underpinnings that lead to why some approaches perform well while others do not. Excellent job of steering the reader toward best practices.
4,"Good, but expect the new one next year.",This book is about MS SQL 2000.So expect next year! MS SQL 2005 will come.
5,Something for Everyone,"When it comes to building databases, this book organizes chapters into an easy-to-follow logical sequence. Nielsen offers something for everyone in this book by taking you from modeling a logical database design, to implemtation, to performance tuning. He provides easy-to-follow examples all throughout the book. Personally, I found his ""Best Practice"" opinions and suggestions priceless!"
4,"Good content, weak index","The content of SQL Server 2000 Bible is expertly written and presented. Author Paul Nielsen is completely deserving of the kudos he's getting on these pages. I find there are examples of everything I'm looking for buried somewhere in this book.The operative word being 'buried.' There's the rub. My only complaint about the book is something the author had no control over: the quality of the index. In these types of reference books, you're completely dependent on the index to lead you to the proper place in the book. I find my hit rate is about 50% or so. In general, the tack of the Bible series is to aggregate items in the index into topics like 'code,' 'data,' 'design,' language,' 'model' (you get the idea) while the reader (this reader, at least) is looking for an arrangement that is a bit more pratical.Despite this shortcoming, Nielsen's book is one you'll keep close by your side as your navigate the depths of SQL Server."
1,U get what U pay for,"I should know better. You but after market, you get CRAP! Doesn't hold a charge for very long. Thanks Amazon for being like the other rip off artists on the web"
3,Overpriced,Be sure to buy the third edition. But don't pay $100. The web site price at one of the two major book store chains is $63 plus shipping. The other chain does not sell it. Or buy it used for $25 to $40. It is a difficult book. Expect frustration with an author so vain he makes up his own notation. The Student Solution manual (ISBN 9780971576643) for the third edition is an extra $33 and gives methods for solving odd numbered problems. It is a necessity. The solutions manual makes up for some of the text book's opacity. Currently Amazon does not sell the solutions manual. The only place I've found the student solutions manual is at matrixeditions.com.
2,Confusing book,"Math and Physics majorThis is a good book if you are solid in set theory. The prerequisites do not emphasized set theory enough. It gives a brief overview in the begining but not extensive enough.Also, although I can accept theorems written in set theory, even the examples are in set theory. In fact, alot of examples are really just corollaries. I take math to apply to physics. There are very few practical examples that apply to the real world.Also, notation is horrendous. Hubbard tends to make up the notation as he goes along. This is going to make it very confusing in later classes.Needless to say, there are careless typos.This is not a well written pratical textbook."
1,all of the sea,"This is probably and exciting book if you are 10 years old. After reading O'Brien, Kent, Pope, & Nelson, this is really simple and boring.There is a big difference between telling and narrating a story. We have the thoughts of the characters and very stilted dialog. The author has statements like ""boom, baboom, boom boom. Cannons!"" and ""Cheers. Screams. Commands "" in an attempt to describe warfare activity. Compared to the authors above, the action lacks excitement, the characters lack inrerest,the story lacks a satisifying climax and the final events are so contrived as to be laughable. Skip this one ... especially at $24.00 for a paperback."
5,Very hard to beat. I love this knife!,"I cook a lot, and and very picky about knives. This one's a winner! If I could only have one single knife in my whole kitchen, it would be this one. The big curved handle fits my (average male) hands really well. The blade is the right size and has the right amount of curvature. There is plenty of weight and an almost totally rigid blade (doesn't flex more than you'd want). And most importantly, the thing sharpens up like a sword. After I hand-sharpened it, guests who use this knife tell me they find it almost scary how sharp it is. And it stays sharp with very minimal maintenance. This knife is the best for all-around cooking. (For more delicate, super-precise cooking, try the Wusthof Asian Cook's Knife instead.)"
1,Why is this guy famous?,"I've tried to like his music so many times but in the end, I just don't see what the big deal is about this guy. He's is obviously an excellent guitar player but his tone is generic and his original songs are instantly forgettable. He's is not in the same league as Hendrix, Clapton, Rory Gallagher, SRV, Warren Haynes, Duane Allman, etc."
5,JOE BONAMASSA LIVE FROM ROYAL ALBERT HALL,"GREAT DVD WITH EXCELLRNT MUSIC BY AN OUTSTANDING MUSICIAN!!!!!!!!! I WOULD RATE THIS DVD A 10,HANDS DOWN."
5,pattycake,"Bought this the first time for my son, I am now buying as many of bonamsa's dvds as are published, Listen to this one time and you are hooked by his love of music & his dexterity. Very, very good."
5,Smokin' Joe's got Skills!!!!!!!!,"I've have been fortunate enough to see Joe 6 times. What a great way tospend an evening. He's all about the music.Amazing talent!!!!Hope he comes back to the Akron,Ohio area soon and often.I've been folling his music since before Bloodline. Saw him on an A&E;documentary, and then i was hooked."
5,Bonamassa At His Best!,I can't get enough of this DVD! As a fairly new but HUGE fan of Joe Bonamassa I bought the DVD after the Royal Albert Hall CD and both are fabulous. A must for any Blues/Blues Rock fan. Smokin' Joe Rocks!
5,Joe Bonamassa Live from the Albert Hall,For anyone who likes blues and has not heard of Joe Bonamassa this is a must have DVD available from Amazon. I have only two words to describe this mans talent and that is SIMPLY MAGNIFICENT
4,GREAT Sound!,"Im not the biggest Bonamassa fan, some songs are great, others I can do without. But this is a great show, and if you have surround sound, CRANK IT UP! the ambient sound is fantastic. It sounds like youre in the theater."
5,Joe Bonamassa,My boyfriend watches youtube and come across Joe Bonamassa live from the Royal Albert Hall. He love it so much he what the DVD and CD to have. He love them both. Came in get time.
5,Exquisite,"Folks this will be very short and to the point.I have a concert and music documentary DVD collection of 300+ and counting. It includes many, if not most, genres of music.This DVD has made it to the Top 5 with the first viewing."
3,"Great performance, wanting video & audio","Glad I read these reviews. Those that have stated that the DVD is not normal blu-ray quality as well as the sound are right on. When I first put it in I wondered if this was truly a blu-ray disc. The video was not ultra crisp and the sound especially bass was lacking. I had to check if my subwoofer was working or on. I thought something was wrong with my eyes and ears. Compared to Rush - Snakes and Arrows and Toto - Falling in Between this pales in comparison in both areas. That being said the performance is stellar, the band tight and the venue is beautiful. I agree that it would have been nice for the producers of the DVD to have made it top quality to go with the performance. This is still worth buying whether in the regular DVD format or blu-ray. One last thing, on the DVD case it says that it has Dolby Digital and DTS although only DTS shows up as a selection...interesting."
4,Great DVD,"I just had a chance to watch this dvd. It made me wish I had been to the concert live. Joe Bonamassa will never replace SRV, but it's nice to have his music to fill in what might have been. The visuals are great and the sound is tremendous. He's not that great of an interview, but he does love the blues. All this being said, if I had known that this is only a dvd and not a cd, I would have looked for the music rather than the video. Music is for listening, not for watching."
4,"Great Concert, Great Performance, Mediocre Sound","A friend of mine told me about Joe Bonamassa and how good this concert was. Since I had never heard of him before, I wasn't expecting alot. But this guy is terrific. After watching this concert DVD I immediately went on iTunes and stared buying songs. If you appreciate good guitar work, rock and blues, this is the concert for you. The only negative is the sound is OK at best. I have a really nice home theater with 5.1 surround sound. No matter what setting I used, the sound was OK at best. When I compare this to several Clapton DVDs I have or the Eagles Farwell Tour 1, the sound is dissapointing. But, its not terrible. And the songs and performance are outstanding. This is definitely worth owning."
3,Could've been better...,"Pairing two good drummers up together in a band should be off the hook, one drummer can play the rhythm while the other just tees off. The drum duo on this DVD mostly attempt to play the same drum rolls in unison, the effect of which seems to be that they actually have to slow their playing down in order synchronize with each other. Overall the band on this DVD is very tame, they sound like they could easily be backing a Broadway show. This is blues pasteurized and processed; Bonamassa is a great player, and his band are talented, but this DVD lacks fire and imagination."
2,Joe BLOWnamassa,"What a major dissappointment. Camera was all over the place, and not on the fingers and main attraction. Music was so so at best. Picture and sound quality was non-existant. Overall a huge let down. I had just bought and recieved TOTO'S music DVD. Now that, my friends is a quality live presentation. I have a pretty fair amount of live music dvds. This one is not even a keeper. I wish there was a fair return policy. I would certainly try to recover my loss."
1,received a blank cd,"Just to let you know I've always trusted products I receive from Amazon but this cd I just bought won't play in 3 different players. After looking at the cd's they appear to be blank, nothing is written to them at all. Oh well I really did want to listen to Joe Bonamassa."
4,Joe rox.,"I hope for Joe's sake that people discover this amazing talent.I hope for my sake that he remains a relative unknown in the States so that I can continue to get good seats to his performances without too much trouble.Joe, if your bassist is out with the flu sometime and you need a replacement, just give me a call :-)"
5,simply fantastic,joe bonamassa is simply a great guitarist who must have been born with one in his hands.I own several of his cds' and this dvd just proved what i already thought of how good he really is.I will be looking for him in the area i live to go see him live.This dvd is truly an enjoyable experience>
5,Beautiful Performance!,"A terrific performance from a very humble and talented guy. No he's not Stevie Ray Vaughn, Jimi Hendrix or Warren Haynes...he's Joe Bonamassa and he masterfully displays several different styles of guitar in a very beautiful and enjoyable show. I highly recommend this DVD."
5,All Hail the Master: Joe Bonamassa!,"An absolute joy to watch! Few guitarists play with such feel, and Joe's range is on full and glorious display at the Royal Albert Hall. A triumph for Bonamassa and his band, and one of my very favorite performances by a true master at his instrument."
5,Love this DVD!,"You absolutely can't go wrong with anything by Joe Bonamassa! Then throw in a visit by Eric Clapton and it's more than you can ask for!See one of his live shows, he's amazing! I recommend most of Joe's CDs; I own at least 6 of them. My favorites are You & Me, The Ballad of John Henry and Blues Deluxe, but there really isn't a bad one in the lot."
4,Joe Bonamassa Live from the Royal Albert Hall,Excellent guitarist for one so young; does a brilliant copy of a Led Zep solo that is uncannily similar. Funny to see the elderly english folk in the front sitting placidly...
5,I'm addicted to this DVD,"I saw this on T.V. and had to have it. What I saw on the tube didn't do this DVD justice. Joe Bonamassa is amazing !!!!!!I can't get enough of his playing guitar.He takes you places that you haven't been in a long time. I love Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton and all of the rest of the greats but it's been years since I was so enthralled by someone's ability to play guitar. It is a gift and Joe has learned how to use that gift better than anyone I have heard in a long time ,if ever ! If you really enjoy excellent music that will make you want to first dance and then will make you want to cry, because of the way he sings the blues,then you need to support Joe by purchasing this DVD. By the way, his voice is oh so, so, so sexy I can't say enough about it. You won't be disappointed ."
1,Not that great,"I bought this for my little 3 year old and the pain comes right off. Not sure if the paint has led, but not worth having to take someone to the hospital or having health issues."
5,The life and career of Aaliyah through words and pictures.,"""Aaliyah"", by Tim Footman is probally the best Aaliyah book available. The book contains tons of beautiful pictures of the R&B superstar and actress. You also get an in depth biography.This book is worth it just for the beautiful pictures. Some of the pics are just so stunning. The book contains facts you might not even know about Aaliyah.So, rememer the life and career of Aaliyah, and get this book."
5,AAKIYAH...I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YA,"ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH AALIYAH'S GOTTA BE GOOD..!!I LOVED THE BOOK AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.AALIYAH, BABY. REST IN PEACE"
4,Aaliyah Review,"I like this book because of all the pretty pictures that were inside, they were big and detailed. Sometimes the author would compare Aaliyah to other artist and sometimes get off topic. They just needed to focus on my girl only. THere is a picture of her and Dame in there when she is wearing a black dress and her nipple was showing. I dont like her exposed like that. But overall it was one of the best AALIYAH books I ever had."
1,"Lovely design, but marred by political correctness","This square-shaped gift book is anything but square when it comes to its political content. In a section on ""Villains,"" the author lists Richard Nixon side-by-side with Jeffrey Dahmer, Lee Harvey Oswald, and William Manson. Our nation's noble attempt to defend South Vietnam is denounced and no mention is made of the Communist genocide in Cambodia or of the Communist's bloody rule in South Vietnam. You won't find any quotes in the book from any Republican after Lincoln. Cocaine dealer Abbie Hoffman is quoted approvingly beside Jefferson, Edison, Lincoln, and Stephen Hawking who I believe is British, not American. And based on the quotes from American Indians, such as Powhatan, you'd think that they were all as innocent as lambs, which is odd considering that he himself kept slaves."
4,I want to get Invaded again!,"Invader is about a military base, top secret aircraft, brainwashed soldiers and a crazy UFO that can become the head of a giant leathal robot. What more do you want? This film nicely combines props, models, stop-motion and computer generated effects into one very nice looking film. The story was good and the acting above-average. I was entertained from beginning to end. Wonderful film that I really enjoyed and can't wait to see again. Check it out!"
1,Missleading!,"I purchased this book with the idea that it would have craft show listings for the whole country! It does not state that it is for the PA area only. I live in IL, this book is worthless to me."
5,Comments on Degrees of Belief,"The new book,DEGREES OF BELIEF. is much more than the subtitle, Subjective Probability and Engineering Judgment, would imply. The author presents a scholarly, sensible treatise that covers both theory and practice and, most importantly, builds a beautiful bridge between them.The various quotes from lectures and writings of Karl Terzaghi, Ralph Peck and other giants of the engineering profession add much to the book. Moreover, the author's emphasis on the wholeness of theory and practice and that regardless of the paradigm, judgment is imperative,make this book so outstanding."
2,not up to the michelin quality,"I have many michelin books and this one is so bad that it shouldn't even be in the line-up. The depth and quality of info is poor throughout. The walking tours are only on the map, and not described- the maps are in spanish to boot.I would return this in a minute, but had already marked it up a bit.Do not make the same mistake. Rick Steves, Fodors much much better.It only rates 1 star. Amazon thru another in for good luck??"
2,Not As Good As Hoped For,"As with some others who have purchased this product, it did not have the correct adaptor for my pressure washer. I ended up cannibalizing an old Karcher I had laying around so that I could use the Powerwasher 80004. My 1850 psi unit should have been able to operate this unit fairly well....however, the two nozzles are only putting out 925 psi each, which is not enough to do an effective cleaning job. I am going to keep it for light duty clean ups."
1,Maybe good for light duty,"Purchased this for the purpose of cleaning my deck prior to restaining. I sprayed the deck with top of the line cleaner/ mildew agents, waited the recommended time then attempted to clean with this scrubber. The pressure and/or volume delivered by thgis unit was totally inadequate to clean my deck. I was forced to reinstall my wand and clean the deck one board at a time. The pressure problem was NOT in the delivery unit. I own a 6HP Karcher pressure sprayer. If I can I will return this unit and purchase another, larger unit from Amazon. If I can't I will buy a larger unit from someone other than Amazon."
2,WERE IS DIRECTIONS,Nice equipment NO instructions on how to hook-up or use.Haven't used it don't know how.......Should have some instructions/pictures on setting it up with the power washer.....
4,Very good but a little bit the same from song to song,"I have three Tommy Keene albums - and I wonder how he didn't become a big star. His songs are great and this is another prime example.One star deducted because his songs all seem to go to the same sound - a great sound - but after a whole album's worth it is a little redundant. This may be due to the fact that I just started listening. Sometimes with more time invested the differences unfold themselves to my untrained ear.So, well worth buying - but don't expect it to be the only cd you will ever want to listen to. It may become ONE of your desert island discs."
4,Need the artwork to make it a masterpiece.,"Everthing from A to Z was included in this unauthorized guide to this 80's generation hit. Having said that, it would have been nice to include a special section showing all the comic book covers for the series. The artwork included would have made this guide a complete masterpiece."
5,knowing about this book WILL help the battle!!,"in one word to describe this book i'd use...COMPREHENSIVE.it is a GREAT book for joe beginners and old timers.cartoons-it covers all the old cartoons. it gives episode dates, descriptions and TONS of other little factoids and editorials that are great. there are some funny little things in the book.comics-it covers all the US comics as well as other various versions up to the date it was printed. and gives the same type of factoids and insights as it does the cartoon.it would have been great for art but this isnt an OFFICIAL realse so it can be forgiven.the only thing that holds it back a bit is having next to nothing on the figs but then again there are guides out there that cover that. this book only covers the StORIES of the joe-verse and i am fine with thatshort version...BUY IT!!!!!(p.s. you should buy his transformers version of this book...also excellent)"
5,An epic of resistance!,"""La bataille du rail"" is (who doubts?) one of the most emotive and realistic war films ever made but focused from a totally new perspective. It deals with the different procedures tactics and strategies employed by these brave and anonymous railroad men, who risked their lives under the service of a free France.The film is narrated in a semi- documental style, with a voice in off until the first third part of the movie, and explores all the set of trickeries, acts of sabotage in all the possible fronts; altering with a sophisticated web of communication by then, all the plans of the enemy in question.Fascinating, mesmerizing and unforgettable film that fairly deserved the historical first Award in Cannes in 1946 as Best Film.A classic and one of my preferred cult movies."
2,"Poor history, poor plot, poor video.","1) What's shown here is a distortion of history. The real French resistance, the one to which the French point with pride, didn't begin until late 1943. Yes, the movie does depict the events of the D-Day invasion - June '44 - but the implications are that this behavior was continual throughout the war. For an accurate account, I highly recommend ""The Sorrow and the Pity"".2) The plot rambles back and forth, with much of the movie documentary footage. It isn't woven into the acted scenes very smoothly, and the progression of events therefore jumps around.3) Video quality spans the gradient between poor and atrocious. There's been no attempt at restoration, much needed on a 60+ year-old film.4) There are no extras on the DVD."
3,Not perfect by a long shot.,"I bought this knife for $.. from bed bath and beyond. At first I loved it. It handles well, and keeps a keen edge. I treated this knife as the pride of my collection, not letting it sit dirty for any longer than necesary. I didnt' eve leave it to dry, as I made shure to towel dry it every time. Not even in the dishwaher. All for nought.. It already has rust stains after a meer 3 months of ownership."
3,Go With the Wusthof,Do not like the 5 star handle. The Wusthof knife like this with Kullens blade and Grand Prix handle is a better selection.
3,Big Band Sounds review,"Did not want the original versions because of sound quality, am not an officionato. This album (MP3 download) did not live up to expectations. Sound is not bright, does not come out and hit you like some of the Starsounds recordings, and many tracks have tics and pops which make me believe it is a copied vinyl. If you just want to hear swing from the 30s then its OK for the price."
2,You should know...,This product does NOT have an adaptor that fits Generac pressure washers. I had to return it. Fortunately Amazon made it as easy as possible.
4,"Great cable,12ft. of it, good price for component cable!!!","G.E. in general is a respectable brand in their products because, you can always trust them on their lifetime guarantees, and quality of their products.This cable is constructed well, meaning you wouldnt have to worry about interferrance from outside signals.It's low in price making it affordable, for people that don't want to dish out a lot of money just for cables.Plus they are 12ft.in length, giving you plenty of cable for hookup to your equipment.Compared to monster cable they do very well if not better.Don't get me wrong monster cable make good cables, but i think they are a bit too overpriced, i mean who wants to dish out [$$] in cables?The point is if you don't want to pay a lot, and are looking for a good set of component cables, Buy these, you won't be disappointed."
1,It didn't work too long for me,I bought this cable based on the good reviews at Amazon.com. But it only worked for me for about 1 month. I have problems with one of the 3 connectors and that causes a deep green image. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,poor product!,"The Coby CD player with wireless transmitter is total junk. Paid about $40 dollars for one of these. All the stations that you can choose from to transmit a signal to play your CD all broadcast where I live,so half the time you get other music bleeding into the CD.GO WITH A NAME BRAND AND FORGET THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE."
3,Very Nice...,"I purchased these shoes for my daughter who is not yet walking. The shoes are of really nice quality, very soft. The heart and love design is so adorable. The insides are padded and the back comes up high enough to support little ankles but not too high to make them look like boots. My daughter is currently wearing a size 3 and I purchased 4. Even though they are too big, she can not wiggle her feet out of them.Be careful if you are looking for white,(I was looking for white but must have selected silver) this shoe comes in white and silver (which appears to be white with a slight mettalic silver sponged finish)."
4,great for the price,"I am used to using the ""Professional S"" series of kinves from Henckels, so this was a but of a venture away from my comfort zone. The price was right (approx. $40 special on Amazon), so I went ahead with the purchase. I have found the knife to be extremely sharp and am happy so far with its performance."
1,Air Supply Purifier - Mini,"Three weeks after I purchased this Air Supply Purifier - Mini, I took a flight on Continental from Cleveland to Europe and had this thing around my neck for about 5 to 10 minutes, when a flight attendant stopped by and asked me to turn it off right away. I asked her why.She replied with: '' Last week one of these caught fire and burned a seat and the passenger. They are or will be banned by airlines.''I haven't used it since. Check it out before you buy one for flights on Airlines."
1,Is a cord supposed to fall apart this easily?????,"I ordered this cord for my best friend who was excited to see how much less it cost ordering it here than through a Nextel store. It was alot cheaper, and it came in a timley manner. That is about the only positive thing I can say about this product. Mainly because it fell apart the second day he owned it. He plugged it into his phone to charge it....and the plastic casing fell right off and the wires were exposed!!! He didn't push it to far in or even have to force it. He simply slipped the cord in the provided slot as anyone would when charging their phones...except most chargers don't fall apart right in their hands. Do not buy this product!!!!!!"
5,great product!,"Works as expected...good price, fast shipping, easy install. Used on my bedroom doors. Required a little trial & error to get a tight fit."
2,Mis-matched fabric,"I purchased two tab top valances for my kitchen and then decided I wanted two more for my dining room. I've purchased 6 tab top valances and I cannot find two more that match. Either the fabric of the valance is sewn with the roses upside down, or the patterns are &quot;off&quot;, meaning the roses are either high up on the valance or down low. Also, they are usually out of stock when I go back to the store to try to find more. I am about ready to give up and return the ones that are currently in my kitchen.It's a beautiful design, I just wish the manufacturer had taken more care when cutting and sewing it together."
2,What horror?,"I gave this highly rated book my best try reading 70% before I gave up and deleted it from my Fire. It's not badly written and is actually interesting in the beginning, but to say it is scary or horror fiction is not accurate. It fits more into the fantasy scifi genre. As it became more and more fantastic I became increasingly bored. If you like fantasy fiction, it might be worth a try; otherwise give it a pass."
2,Not-so-family family wallet,"We have 5 passports and after jamming the 5 passports in, there's wasn't much room for anything else. The wallet itself was of very good quality."
2,"Nice looking, but not very utilitarian","I know that other people have offered positive reviews of these knives, and to their credit, they are beautiful. Unfortunately, they just don't cut very well."
2,Problems with the finish of the handles,"When I ordered these knives, they arrived with many noticeable scratches on the handles making the look as if they had been used for several years. Amazon promptly sent a replacement but the new set has the same problems. Unfortunately I'll have to return these knives because they are not acceptable for a nice dining table, especially for new knives."
2,Great cutting - Poor finish,"These knives initially performed flawlessly, but after being washed a few times, they began to rust in the crevices on the handle ends. Maybe we just got a bad production run, but the stainless steel is beginning to turn into stainful steel. I'm going to send these back and buy something a little more higher end. You get what you pay for."
4,sharp and economical,"Despite another reviewer's experience, these knives are quite sharp. To compare them to plastic cutlery is ridiculous -- either the reviewer was being facetious or has an axe to grind for some reason. Notice that that review mentions that the buyer picked up his set for the same price as Amazon but at his local grocery store. How he knows that he even bought this same set of knives is beyond me.So, I'll repeat: These knives are sharp. I don't find the handle particularly comfortable, but it's okay. My set arrived looking brand new -- no scratches.Good value for the money."
1,Anodize comes off after first use - very very bad,"I purchased Cuisinart 12 quart anodized stockpot and only used it twice; washing and drying it after each use and anodize came off after first use. Since ""supposedly"" guaranteed for ""lifetime"" I returned item to Cuisinart and they said item was ""abused"" and didn't honor guarantee. I am over 60 years old and have no youngsters in home so how can it be abused - THEIR ITEM WAS DEFECTIVE AND THEY FAILED TO HONOR THEIR LIFETIME GUARANTEE - I WILL NEVER EVER BUY A ""LIFETIME"" GUARANTEED ITEM FROM CUISINART AGAIN AND WHOLEHARTEDLY RECOMMEND PEOPLE THINK TWICE!"
5,Good Cookware,Bought this item for my daughter and she loves it. Threw away her old stuff because of this. Says in makes cooking enjoyable.
1,Amazon fails to deliver,"I have no idea how good this stockpot is, since amazon cancelled my order - after making me wait for the shipment for almost a year (yes, a year!) Then they finally decided it was no longer available. My guess is: they not only knew this was going to happen, but were actually hoping for it, so they wouldn't have to sell it to me at the advertised bargain price. Either way, one star for amazon's lousy business practices."
3,THIS POT HAS NON-STICK COATING!!,"I just received this item and the paperwork says ""Chef's Classic Non-Stick Hard Anodized"" on it. I called Cuisinart and they confirmed that this pot does indeed have a non-stick coating on it! The representative said that Cuisinart does not use Teflon in any of their products but I'm not sure I trust that this non-stick coating is not a Teflon like product that will emit toxic fumes when heated. Buyers beware if you share your home with a feathered friend!!I'm going to return this item to Amazon and purchase the Calphalon product instead. So much for saving a few bucks!"
3,Is non -stick!,"I ordered this item (on sale) because I wanted to start weaning myself away from the non-stick coatings that have recently been classified as probable carcinogens. In spite of the fact that there was no mention of it in Amazon's product description, the pot does have a non-stick coating. Ohterwise, I'm sure it's a very good buy. (It's still sitting on the shelf, unused.)"
1,Non-stick interior?,"I'm returning my second sample of this today. Both pots I ordered are not non-stick, despite Amazon's description. Even the literature shipped with the product says that it has their ""Quantanium"" non-stick finish. I own many other ""Quantanium"" pans from Cuisinart, none of their interiors look like what has been shipped to me. No wonder they can sell it so cheaply. I am quite disappointed as I have been otherwise happy with Cuisinart's products."
1,"""Hard Anodize"" gone after one use! BEWARE!","I bought this pot new and used it once to steam some fresh green beans. I was shocked that after using it one time, the inside was bare aluminum. The dark grey ""Hard Anodized"" finish was completely gone. My Caphalon hard anodized cookware just gets better with use. Beware of this phony product!"
5,Superb value for a top-quality stockpot,"The person who gave this product one star and ranted about how it ""rusted"" after one use... honestly, that cannot have been this stockpot. This thing is professional quality. I'm a working chef and have a great appreciation for well-crafted kitchen tools. A good, large stockpot is vital for any serious cook, and Cuisinart's 12-quart offering here fills the bill very nicely. The heat transfer is excellent and seems to be very even. Even at my altitude (near Denver, CO), I had no problems getting six quarts of water to a rolling boil in this thing, and at 5,600 feet, that's saying something. The pot is about 8"" high (excluding the lid), and 12"" in diameter. It's a generously sized stockpot, more than enough for almost all the cooking you'd want to do in it. I got mine on one of Amazon's crazy 12-hour sales or something, and it was ridiculously cheap. Even at $30, this thing would be a bargain."
5,Good quality cookware,"Tough, durable and the non-stick surface is great. We bought this for our large party recipes, especially our 6-quart chili recipe. Everything cooks evenly, doesn't burn, doesn't stick, and cleanup is simple. Highly recommend this cookware"
4,good pot,i used this pot towice alredy and it done the job great espically when you have some guests and your small pot don't hold that quntity
5,The best how-to book on adoption that I have read !!!,"I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking well thought-out, insightful, complete information on adoption. I have read 5 adoption books in the last 3 weeks and this is the best by far!!!"
1,"Head, maybe, but no heart","This should really be re-titled ""how to get a healthy white newborn as fast as possible with no questions asked"".I was appalled by the book's total lack of any ethical perspective.A few examples: the author advises readers to lie to adoption agencies in order to be approved as adoptive parents (she dismisses the idea that some people might make unsuitable adoptive parents by saying that prospective abusers will get to children anyway and that unsuitable parents will get children on the blackmarket!) She suggests searching for birth mothers in areas of high unemployment as this makes it more likely that birthmothers will be unable to afford to raise their babies themselves.She even argues that there's nothing wrong with black market adoption except its illegality, and that birthparents should be free to selll babies for profit to those who want to buy.The ""heart"" referred to in the title seems to have no trouble treating children as commodities."
3,"Taking a ""Wait and See"" position!!!!",I believe the reason it's taking so long to get THE BOB NEWHART SHOW season 5 and 6 is that the powers that be are waiting to see how many pre-orders come in. This way they will know whether or not it will be profitable enough to go to the expense of issuing the seasons.The more pre-orders that come in....the more likely it is that it will be released. Soooooo.....send in those orders. It costs NOTHING to order!!!!!!!
1,Where is the remainder of this series???,"When is the remainder of ""The Bob Newhart Show"" going to be released? As well as the remainder of ""All in the Family"" and ""Maude???"" These are classic shows.....PUT THEM OUT IN THEIR ENTIRETY!! This is an absolute disgrace!!"
5,"All-Time Classic, Please Release The Entire Series!!","Just adding my name to the list of fans who are waiting for seasons 5 and 6 of this great 70's sitcom. As a kid I watched it in my grandmother's apartment on Saturday nights along with, if memory serves, The Carol Burnette Show and and... I guess memory doesn't serve because all I can really remember is Bob Newhart! Come on Fox, release seasons 5 and 6!! (And no, not in a box set so you can sell seasons 1-4 all over again.)"
1,16 months later and still waiting,"So who else ordered Seasons 5 & 6 last summer (August 2011) as soon as they announced the impending release?Still waiting, all this time later. Considering what dreck gets full series releases these days, I am amazed by how many beloved, classic '70s series are still languishing.All I Want for Christmas...is for the rest of The Bob Newhart Show, Rhoda, Maude, One Day at a Time, The Jeffersons, and Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman to be released on DVD already!One star for the interminable delay!"
2,Nice but glass was broken.,"The frame is solid, but the glass mirror was broken when I received it. I see only a tiny amount of glue on the frame to hold the mirror. The frame borders are black, not green. It would look nice over a door and would be a good deal if the mirror was secure."
5,Good one,Really a good one for the price.We placed it and started deflecting all the bad energy coming into our house.You can purchase this and place it if you believe if not it will sit in your drawer for yrs.
2,a bit cheap,"I ordered 4 to hang 3 outside in the garden and 1 out front on the sun deck. One of four mirrors was chipped (no chip in wrapping, so was packed chipped), and after 2 months all the stickers (!) around the mirror are beginning to fall of. It's too much trouble to return so I keep super-glueing instead. But I won't buy these same ones again."
2,Small,"This is very small product, so when you look for such product pay attention to its size and if you still do not understand how big it is take a ruler and look at the size of this product."
3,It is ok,It is ok. It could have been of better quality. I had to re-glue the sticker to the wood after some months of use.
1,Get what you pay for,"Very poor construction and definitely not suited for the outdoors, which is what a bagua mirror is designed for. Right out of the package, the mirror fell off - managed to get that superglued back on and then the hook fell out. Again, got that superglued back on but now the sticker part is peeling off.Cute little mirror and definitely cheap but you get what you pay for. I'm now spending the money for a mirror that will hold up without superglue efforts."
2,Don't buy if you don't have days to put together n decorate.....,"I bought this n made it for my daughters 4th bday. I didn't like it because its a slick plastic n it's very hard to decorate the towers n I had to hot glue the towers to the cardboard. N when I placed the back towers in, it was heavy and made the whole back of the cake fall down. I was really upset."
2,Not for amateurs!! :),"Just want to warn potential buyers that the kit only includes plastic parts. Considering the price, this makes sense.You will need to have/buy round cake pans (or square pans) in multiple sizes for the cakes. Make sure the larger tiers are big enough so that you are able to position the turrets/castle towers along side the cake sitting atop the base cake.You DEFINITELY need to secure the towers with dowels as other reviewers have said...unless you plan to just shove them into the cake, which also works, but is not as stable or attractive.Decorating the towers is tedious and time-consuming, so be prepared.You can get everything you need from Walmart (decorating tips, bags, accessories, cake pans) in the wedding aisle--much cheaper than cake supply store.Cake was a hit and I was able to serve vegan/organic cake but boy was it a lot of work. The kit requires that you buy quite a lot more than what's included in order for the cake to be made."
4,Fun Fun Fun,"Made my daughter a ""Tangled"" birthday cake with this kit.The towers were easy to paint iced vines and flowers on and the cones were easy to ice and then sugar. The cake ended up looking great!!!Gave it 4 stars as attaching the towers was difficult... they are quite tippy with the cones on top. And fell over a number of times before I got them to stay in place. If the bottom of the towers were open then I would have been able to attach them with a dowel to the base. I suppose you could use hot glue to attach them to the base as well.Also, as the towers are hollow, but sealed you have to be careful that you don't submerge the peices when washing. Water will get into the hollow part and is difficult to get it out again.Overall, I loved it and can't wait to make another cake with it. Everyone thought the cake looked great :D"
2,castle cake tin,i was a bit disappointed with this cake set as most of it is plastic and not actually cake. if anyone knows where I could get a awesomne cake tin that is actually cake not just plastic surrounding a cake :) although this does look nice all decorated its a nuisance.
2,too complicated,"When the castle cake set arrived it was disappointing. I thought it would have the cake pans as well. It is very complicated to put together, and I did not even try after opening it up and seeing the contents. I still do not know how you could put this together without it falling over. It is not worth the amount of time it would take to do this cake."
1,Not real impressed,"After mechanically installing the regulator, putting most of pieces back in, tested the unit by connecting the door panel switches, before reaffixing the door panel. It did not work. Took the door all apart again to remove the regulator and figure out what was wrong. Had power at the plug in point to the regulator, tested the regulator motor with jumper wires, it worked, finally figured out the connecting pins in the supplied regulator connector were too short to make contact when plugged in and fully seated. Had to cut off the plug from the old regulator and spliced it onto the supplied new regulator. Spent more time trouble shooting, removing and reinstalling this new regulator than it would have taken to fix the broken regulator I had."
2,doesn't fit,"The sound quality of these headphones are quite good. However, they simply don't stay in my ear. I hook them over my ear and they just hang there. When I try to jam them in the ear canal, not only does it hurt, but they don't stay in. This was a waste of money..."
1,ignorant,"obviously this author has no sense for how ""cruel and unusual"" Osama and Saddam are. Only a real idiot could mistake mass murdering tyrants for a liberator."
4,Unique Insight,"This edition of Bukowski's letters is indespensable to Bukowski scholars and would be of great interest to anyone who wants to look deeper into the mind of the late writer. The greatest insight one derives from reading these letters is that Bukowski and Chinaski--his literary persona and, to some extent, alter-ego--are not identical. Bukowski, by the 1980s, increasingly relied upon the character Henry Chinaski--who pops up in poems, stories, novels, and the screenplay Barfly. Moreover, his work became, during this period, increasingly based on his ""real"" life. Thus, it can be difficult to ascertain where the real Bukowski leaves off and the fictive Chinaski begins. Well, the letters help to clarify this distinction. Whereas Chinaski is a tough guy who craves solitude and forsakes the company of artists, it seems that Bukowski corresponded regularly with a series of fellow writers, often whining about money and literary respect."
2,Some might like it,"For my experience, I have seen better. Some good visuals.The naration was actually a mountaineer's philosophy script from John Muir in the 1800's.......a worship of 'mother earth'.I'm after something more suitable on Yosemite, because I know it is a stately and beautiful place from digital images I purchase online!As for me, why not worship our CREATOR and ENJOY His Creation....both Now and Later_Jesus spoke of a PARADISE in Heaven......I've heard some wonderful descriptions of it from people who have had NDE's (near death experiences)....we get but a taste of it here in some beautiful places......and it's REALLY GREAT to enjoy those.See my other reviews on NATURE and CREATION should you feel like-wise."
4,Great looks for the money,"The Tach is housed in a plactic case, but looks and works very well. Easy hook up and instructions are better than most automotive items."
2,I don't think it's worth the money,"It may be me, but once you attached these things, the vibration doesn't carry along. It just too soft to do anything. I won't recommend this as the Hitachi does it job by itself. I was disappointed."
4,Quality product,Product is well made and should last forever. Product is heavy and causes the vibrator to be MUCH noisier than without the attachment. Didn't need both shapes; a single straight one is fine and wold be cheaper than the set.
3,OK!,"These articles are just OK, but not wonderful. They do the trick, but are very hard and somewhat uncomfortable to use. One of them cracked upon placing it on the head of the vibrator they were meant for, so it is now useless. The other one (the curved item) is still alright, but as with teh straight attachment, not very comfortable. A so-so purchase on my part!"
5,omg,Omg Omg Omg Omg Omg Omg Omg Omg Omg Omg Omg Omg Omg Omg Omg Omg Omg Omg Omg Omg Omg Omg .... love the curved one :)
4,Magic Wand Review,"Our last one broke after a few years, so, we decided to get another one.Unlike so many products sold today, the item is identical to what we bought nearly four years ago.Solid, sturdy, dependable. We used the first one thousands of times (walk-ins are free to relax with it as they sit in the waiting room), and look forward to using this one at least as long.Fair price, delivered faster than expected. Very satisfied. Highly recommend this merchant. Thank you"
2,Great at first,"We loved this at first. The kids were thrilled to have a hot lunch and I was thrilled the leftovers were not going to waste. But then the lids locked shut and all the aides at school tried to help my children get it open. When the food cools it creates a vacuum and the lid is on so tight you can't get it off. It happens after repeated use and just gets worse. Mr. Bento is much better, worth the price. My kids have been using that for months with no spills, hot food, variety. Save your money, this isn't worth it."
5,excellent,i just wish they would make it into a cd-rom or disk so that we could type on the from then print it out
3,Only for meat with Bones,"This meat cleaver has a nice sized and weighted blade, a comfortable handle that won't slip.I was very excited when I received the knife. Right out of the box, I tested on a cucumber and to my amazement I couldn't cut though the skin a cucumber. I can however chop up a whole chicken as easily as bread knife cutting bread.After look at the blade edge you can under why. The thick knife blade has a very small V shape edge, it's made for chopping not cutting.The proper role for this cleaver is to dice up anything that has shell, bone, frozen etc... It's not a everyday knife for cutting up stuff.ProChopping with easeConJust for ChoppingOne little rust spot show up on the blade less then a week = keep it dry or it will turn brown on youCosts far too much for just choppingConclusion:If you regularly dice up whole chickens with bones, Meat with bone or just large piece of meat, buy this one. As for me, I will be returning this for the Five Star Santoku Knife"
5,Yes! This wonderful book is back in print at last!,This dear book about three homeless little dogs is clever and original. I agree that this is Gag's best book and I am delighted that another generation of children will get to know it. This new beautiful oversized edition is even more wonderful than the old(loved to tatters)one I already own. I have bought a copy for my little grandson and another one for my own collection.
5,Great story and illustrations,"My granddaughters, 2 and 3 years old, love this story. It's very well written and offers a lot for the girls to talk about and helps improve their vocabulary. I love Wanda Gag's books, the illustrations are wonderful and the stories are imaginative."
5,Another marvelous Wanda Gag book!,I bought this for my two and a half-year old granddaughter and it immediately became her favorite book. My daughter said they have read it every night ever since she received it. I highly recommend this and all of her other books. I bought it on the recommendation of others and they were not wrong!
1,Garbage compared to the full season,"This is really just an edition targeted to people browsing the DVD shelf for a movie/anime to watch, its only purpose for being produced is so they can give you something to buy, with any enjoment you might have being secondary to them having your money. I know, in all fairness I cant really assume its just a money grab, but thats what I thought of the movie thirty minutes in. Your money is better spent buying the full season of the show, even if its one volume at a time."
2,Issues with toy,"All I can say is that I was really excited to use this on my man. Unfortunately as we were in the midst of our sexual adventure trying it out, the toy actually broke off and had to be removed with a large forcep from his rectum in the Emergency Room by the doctor. I am not sure if anyone else has experienced this but let me tell you it was humilitating for both of us and definatly killed the mood. We cannot expect to go to the same ER ever again. Use with caution and lots of lube -the first twenty minutes were great!"
2,Size matters....oww,"So I tried this on my boyfriend for some backdoor fun, and let's just say it's a bit bigger than either of us had expected. It also has this odd chemical smell that never goes away, so that may ruin some people's fun. It's not quite solid, so it's hard to maneuver properly, and the texture isn't quite realistic, so that too may bother some. The straps seem to have a lot of extra material, so you'll have to experiment on different lengths for each section to get the angle you're looking for."
4,Can't beat the price,"First of all like others have said it is a little rough on turkey just don't hack at it nice clean cutting motion works best.Second of all super for hams and roasts ,would have given it 5 stars but that fork gives me fits it just needs to be offset a little not so straight"
3,Not perfect - but good,It isn't as good as the old fashioned regular knives my parents had but it does work well. The serrated knife is taking me a little time to get used too but it does cut well. We don't use it very often so I can't comment on how long it will stay sharp. For the price I'm satisfied!
3,Not so great.,Like everyone else says the everedge just isnt that great. It basically just tore the meat as I cut.
2,Destroyed the turkey!,"I should have known that the price was too good to be true. This knife massacred our bird! If you are looking for a good, sharp knife this is NOT it."
5,Mrs. Allen's: On All Fours,"The best, most stratforward book on dealing with dogs that I have ever read!"
4,good overview of issues,"If Catholics want to understand why unity is impossible, I would read this book. Protestants should read it and try to figure out how much truth should be sacrificed on the alter of unity. The most important sections was how the false claims of the papacy rose. I would suggest Calvin's Institutes as another reference. Michael Horton is also an engaging writer. Also deals with core issues such as justification and Catholic veneration of Mary."
5,Excellent Overall Summary of What Divides,"Horton writes an excellent executive summary, if you will, of what truly continues to divide the churches of the Reformation from Rome.Primarily as then, Rome's insistence on adding to Scripture alone as the only source of theology; of adding to grace and faith alone as the only source of salvation, continues to erect a huge, major divide between the two. As Horton correctly quotes Avery Dulles in Rome's continued holding to the anathemas of Trent as still prevailing now in Vatican II times, this is absolutely Rome's position.My own church speaks in detail about this. See ""The Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification in Confessional Lutheran Perspective"" available at www.lcms.org/ctcr/docs/pdf/justclp.pdf, or read Robert Preus' excellent work: Justification and Rome."

4,the essentials that everyone knows about but very few follow,"27 long years in the IS industry and sometimes I wonder about the progress that we have made. We are still pouring money on systems that our users dont want. The truth is that its all very basic stuff. follow those basics and your staff and the users of those systems will be happy.these 30 pages remind you of all those basics, which IS organizations should have been following long ago, but they are not. we keep repeating those mistakes. you wont find aything in this ebook about programming or proj management methodologies (re - another reviewer's comments)- you will get what this page says in the description. if you still buy it, you wont be disappointed. Once you buy it, post it for constant reminders or get it in your company's processes."
1,Too elementary,"...It's been put together who knows only the theoretical concepts of IT project management and doesn't seem to have any real-world IT experience. I am sorry I bought this - its too Text booky without any book in it.... it is simply too basic, and it still provides no new approach of mitigating IT Project risk. Most large-scale IT projects already do whats mentioned in the book: good project scoping, technology evaluation, ROI measurements but projects still fail.I've been an IT project manager for a while and I have to say this book is really quite disappointing. It's not worth [the money]and certainly not with the time spent reading it."
1,Nothing New,"This article was a disapprovement.If my uncle was about to lead an application development project, he could have written this article (he's a building entrepreneur).Project management by describing all parts of the project, estimating time on each task, etc., etc. - we all know it. I'd state that most IT projects have been administered this way, only it isn't enough.If you're interested in developing skills on delivering projects on schedule, do rather study what's written on Xtreme Programming or Feature Driven Programming. Those concepts address problems with application development from somewhat new angles. This article doesn't.If this surprises you that a problem with many IT projects is they don't pay off as much as promised. - go on and spend your nine dollars."
4,More than a one hit wonder,"Many people remember Mott the Hoople as a one-hit wonder with All The Young Dudes. A few more stuck around through three more brilliant albums for Columbia Records before Ian Hunter left the band and enjoyed some success of his own. But before all that, Mott the Hoople were a struggling band on Island Records (Atlantic in the US) whose albums were commercial disasters and whose live performances were legendary.This import Best of the Island Years is a much better retrospective than Rock and Roll Queen. While the latter is great for its straight ahead rock, the former showcases the depth of the band.There are also some great rarities that were previously available only on a vinyl release titled Two Miles From Heaven (not the same as Two Miles From Live Heaven) not available on CD anywhere else.(EDIT - Two Miles From Heaven is now available as an import CD.)"
4,Perfectly good sampler of the period,"I picked up this sampler of Mott's Island albums for the car and it works just fine as such. It is no replacement for the albums themselves, ultimately, and I have a few minor quibbles about some songs that ought to have been here, but what IS here is all worthy. It sounds good, has a couple of little gems from the vaults, and the liner notes are fun and useful. I must put in a plug for Brain Capers, my choice for the most criminally overlooked album of the 1970's (and one of my desert island records), so if you like what you hear here, then by all means you must get that. But as an intro, sampler for the car, or argument as to why Mott was great well before Dudes, this is a go."
5,Great sample of early Mott,"For fans who are unfamiliar with pre-All the Young Dudes Mott,this is a great cross section of their first 4 albums.The rockers {Rock and Roll Queen,etc.}are raucous and not as polished as their later work but just as enjoyable.Listening through you can hear Ian Hunter finding his singing and songwriting voice.Musically they were becoming a more focused unit as well.I always preferred the Mick Ralphs era and he is well represented here.This is a band capable of wild abandon at their most rocking,and great poignancy in their quieter moments and both are displayed amply in this collection.One of the most overlooked bands of the 70's but one of the best{and one of my absolute favorites to this day!}.If you don't own the first 4 albums this is a great place to start. Highly recommended!"
1,Boring,All I want to say is this book is so boring. All I wanted to do when I was reading it was shoot myself in the mouth with a pistol to end the constant eternal boredom. I think all it was trying to do was impress a few academic kooks who live in an academic bubble. Yeah well its boring.
3,Another Best Of Stealers Wheel,"Hey if you haven't bought a copy of Stealer's Wheel's Greatest Hits yet, well ""Stuck In The Middle"" is your album. It has all the major hits on it, ""Stuck In The Middle"", their big US hit is there, so is ""Benediction"" as well as ""Everything Will Turn Out Fine"", as well as my favorite, ""Late Again"" There's not much new here that you won't find on the domestic copies of their Greatest Hits. It's a good album but not great. The thing that I do like about this album is that I record all my music In a little higher quality and this is where this album sounds good. You notice this on ""Blind Faith"", the piano sounds great and you can actually hear the backup vocals. So if you like good quality and a nice mix on your music, check out ""Stuck In The Middle"" a nice little Stealers Wheel disc, and the nice part I saved for last is that at Amazon you can usually find it at a good price."
1,crap,This is a bulls**t version of the steeler wheels song. Waste of my money and time downlaoding which took forever
1,Ripoff!,These are not the original recordings. They are re-recorded by somebody else or alternate takes on the original songs. This is a total ripoff.
3,STEALERS WHEEL CD,"I REALLY LIKE JUST ONE OF THE SONGS ON THIS ONE HIT WONDER. WHEN ONE OF THE GUYS FROM THE BAND DIED, I FELT I OWED IT TO THEM TO ADD THIS ALBUM WITH IT'S ONE GREAT SONG TO MY COLLECTION OF CD'S. WHEN SELLERS HAVE NEW CD'S AT SUCH A LOW PRICE, IT IS EASY AND AFFORDABLE TO PICK UP A CD THAT IS BRAND NEW BUT VERY REASONABLE IN PRICE."
2,Suggests shaken baby syndrome isn't real.,"I purchased this product because I am a fan of Primetime and I wanted to use it as a teaching tool for a workshop in preventing shaken baby syndrome. The video says little if nothing about prevention and most of the program explores science which suggests that shaken baby syndrome is essentially just a myth. It suggests that infants diagnosed with shaken baby syndrome were probably injured in some other manner, and that they are misdiagnosed with shaken baby syndrome, wrongly accusing the parents of child abuse. While this may be true in some cases, shaken baby syndrome is a real and devistating injury. The message I want to convey to my students is to NEVER EVER shake a baby, and this is not the message this program conveys."
5,It's Personal,WOW. I am on my 2nd read of the book that goes with this workbook. I have purchased about a dozen copies for a Women's Advance I will be hosting next month. This is one I am sure I will use over and over again. The workbook is great too for individual and group work. I am recommending this to all of my counselee's. Thanks.
5,life changing,"I bought this guide after I read the book that it is based on. This book contains so much more ""gold"". The author obviously spent a lot of time preparing this.I am so grateful that I bought it - this book has changed my life!I pray that God blesses the author for blessing me."
5,Great suppliment for the book,"I had read ""Secrets of the Secret Place"" before but wanted to read it again. The companion guide enhances the book so much. I would definitely recommend having it if you intend to read the book."
2,Better for group study,"I purchased this book for me to do at home along with the ""Secrets of the Secret Place"" devotional but found that it's not as beneficial as I thought. It is made, I believe, more for group study."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent course for those who desire to draw closer to Jesus in their ""Secret Place"" in life. Recommend for a small group!"
4,Cd is okay for a comeback,"Although I liked this new cds is okay, compared to TIMBIRICHE CLASICO, the only thing that I found disappointing was the fact that most of the song included in this cds are from when the group was at its youngest age. I would say that some of these songs are childish. The other thing that really bothers is that in the song 'Muriendo Lento' the groups seems to have missed some of the lyrics and sing out of tune. Other than that it is all right."
1,Patético,"El regreso de los apóstoles del pseudo-pop es todavía más patético ahora que hace algunos años, que aún a pesar de la máquina mercadotecnica de televisa y el productor Luis Llano no pudieron aguantar el paso de la evolución y del desarrollo de nuevas corrientes menos falsas y artificiales que Timbiriche.El triunfo de timbiriche es solo una muestra de la falta de buen gusto musical de una buena parte la ahora generación Y, que se conformaba con letras vacías, covers mal traducidos, o ñoñerías nauseabundas que se ven aún mas ridículas cantadas por un grupo de treintañeros idealizados que realmente no dejan ningún mensaje útil.Lo único bueno de este disco es que a lo mejor es el último de esta banda."
5,"Great music, great memories, great time....AND LIVE!!!!","I have waited ten years for this cd, and it is not a dissapointment!!! For anyone who grew up listening to the group, this will be a must have. For anyone who attended their concerts, it'll be like reliving it all over again. From the first note to the last, it is a great album, which brings back tons of memories and joy to the heart, because for its two hour duration, allows one to be a kid again. Also included are three new tracks, the most appealing in my opinion, is the electrically charged, esta despieto. This album is a great buy because you get all the group's hits sung in one album and performed live, in what is sure to be an unforgettable experience for those of us lucky enough to have been a part of."
2,These are the old versions,"These are not the kids. These are the kids grown up. Their voices have changed, their style has changed, just about everything has changed. Only the lyrics and melodies are still the same. If you are hoping to satisfy feelings of nostalgia, you will find this DVD very frustrating."
4,Nice animation and really funny,I bought this for curiosity and I was actually enjoyed by it. The animation was nice and the episodes were pretty funny. I found this series a little more entertaining than I thought it was going to be at first. Lovely story of love and beautiful girls.
4,heavy fan,"Not bad, story was half way decent. Looking for 2nd season to see what pans out. Would like to see more carector devolopment."
1,Shallow script and film,"I find the film to be lacking in content. For one thing, I do not see any enrichment with Hungarian or Polish culture in the background. Moreover, the film does not raise any interesting issues between men and women in marriage; it only depicts the plight of a man with two women who decides to make a choice. The main character is superficial because he only thinks of women as sex objects. There is a wealth of issues of conflicts between men and women in marriage. There is also a wealth of ways of presenting romance between a man and woman. By adding humor and misunderstanding through exaggeration coupled with some culture of the countries involved, I could write a script that would be more interesting to watch in a movie than a man who spends a full 24 hours in a car reflecting on his predicament."
5,Great Book!,"This is an excellent book! I had fast service, good quality, and I am enjoying reading and learning from this book!!"
2,New Book? ... Not,"I ordered this book for a graduate class on Second Language Acquisition. The book was supposed to arrive new but it was used. It had been highlighted by a previous reader and was mailed in a flimsy paper envelope so that the front cover, back cover, and binding was damaged. It was not shipped in a timely manner therfore it arrived long after I expected it. I had to keep it because my class was starting and there was no time to order another one. The seller lied and I'm dissapointed. The content of the book itself is good but the third edition is better and more organized, I bought one three weeks into my class at the book store."
5,great service,The service received was great. It took exactly 3 days to recive the product. The product received was also in great shape. Thank you for saving me quite a few dollars.
2,Efficient but wrong edition,"I recieved my book very quick. That was great, however, there are three editions to this book. I needed the second edition, but was sent the first. My teacher worked with me about my book so that was fine and considering the price I paid, I was very happy."
1,A Must Have For Teachers of English Language Learners,This book provides valuable information necessary to facilitate the needs of ELLs in the classroom. It describes strategies that are useful for all levels of English Language Learners and explains the rationales for using them. The book also presents teaching scenarios from real classrooms that use the SIOP model in order to further understand the strategies in depth.
2,"Very quiet wipers, except for the loud, incessant squeaking!","Right from the first use during a rain storm, they squeaked loudly with every wipe. During the next few rain storms and uses, only for a brief period did they not squeak. I have NEVER had other wipers squeak as much as these do! I notified the manufacturer, and - to their credit - they shipped me replacement wipers of a different ""model"" of theirs. That was honorable of them, but it doesn't negate the irritating noise these ones made. And don't believe their ""superior quality"", ""long-lasting"" claims. In the paperwork they include with their wipers, they admit that the wipers should be replaced every six months - just like regular, cheap ones!"
3,great record,ordered and paid too much but whatever that's your conscience because you're not a music fan but a product mover.
5,"tortured, desperate, like drowning","the first time i listened to the come sub pop 7"", i thought they pressed it at the wrong speed.couple other descriptions:1. this record feels like sleep paralysis2. this record feels like when you are dreaming, and you go to hit someone, but you cant because your arms weigh 10 million pounds.like the other reviewers said, this is one of the best records of the 90's. totally overlooked by everybody. you should definitely check this out, you wont be disappopinted."
4,Needs another 200 pages,"An excellent overview of napoleons cavalry and its leaders as the title states. Well written, some interesting insights, personal anecdotes and fluid writing style makes this a cut well above average. I held back one star from this five star work as the subject could certainly have been 4 to 500 pages given the wealth of the subject."
5,"CUTCO spokesman should go back to ""school""","Clearly, our friend down there with the rave reviews of Cutco knives, while possibly an aggressively discerning consumer, has yet to master the fine art of word processing. Or perhaps his ecstatic reaction to the ""superiority"" of Cutco knives has left him verbally disabled. Regardless of his intelligence, the presence of three nearly identical postings of his ""real life testimonial"" stink of covert advertisement. Tell us who you really work for dude."
5,How many Cutco(s) in use in professional kitchens,"Just a word... ask a chef (one who wears whites and checkered pants 15 hours a day and smells of fish and garlic) How many Cutco knives are in their kitchens.If you're using a knife 8 hours a day, trust me... your cutco knife will be relegated to the trash can or cutting boxes."
2,Handles may be scratched and discolored,"I purchased the 5 piece set which is a nice combination. However, the handles were marred and discolored. I sent them back and got another set with the same problem. I have since visited many retail stores and seen the same problem. I contacted Henkels and they told me that they were aware of the problem and to try rubbing some oil on them. I did which darken them up but did nothing to the scratches.The blades are excellent, however the 5-star handles have issues. Just check them out carefully before you buy."
3,Why are they looking rusty?,"I registered for these as a wedding gift, and received the 9 pc set. They are really nice, but within 6 months, there were little orange spots on the blades. 2 years later, I cringe everytime I look at them, thinking how expensive they were and how I hate how they look. I thought they were supposed to be rust proof. I've NEVER put them in the dishwasher. I don't know why they are like this. Maybe we have hard water? I asked the Williams Sonoma sales person 6 months after my wedding, and he said they should not be doing that. (I noticed WS no longer carries the line now, I wonder why.) Has anyone else had this problem?"
3,Henckels v Cutco,"These knives are of superior quality but really do not match up to Cutco. I have both sets in my kitchens in US and France, the Cutco knives are more durable and are weighted better. If you want to impress people then buy Henckels if you want a blade to serve you for a lifetime buy Cutco.Chris."
3,Test before you buy,"I have one Henckels Five Star knife (5 inch blade approximately, cost about 70$), and a set of Cutco. Both are pretty good, but I'd go with the cutco, as the Henckels gets dull pretty quickly when it contacts either a plate or cutting board, and the handle is definitely not dishwasher friendly, it gets marred quite readily. As for balance, both are balanced pretty well, but the handle of Cutco feels better. Cutco is expensive, and so is Henckels, so be smart when you buy, and try to get the most free stuff you can from the Cutco rep if you choose to go that route. The warranty for Cutco is definitely better than Henckels, which basically has no warranty. Hope this was helpful."
3,not the best translation,"This is a lovely romantic story by a Swedish author; it was written in the 1800s. However there is a previous translation by Yvonne L. Sandstroem, titled ""The Queen's Diadem."" It was published in 1992 by Camden House of South Carolina. Unforunately, the 250-page trade paperback was priced at around $50, and for that reason it never received much popularity."
3,Basic Introduction to C# and .NET,"This book wasn't a bad introduction to C# and .NET. Being familiar with C++, I had no problem understanding any of the content. Not really 'meaty' enough to unleash the real power of these technologies, but enough to give the reader a taste."
4,Absolutely Unique Data Layer Examples,"I have most of the better selling C# books on the market. That gives me a unique perspective. Among all of the books dealing with ADO.NET / C# data access, this one stands alone in showing the reader how to construct a Domain Object Model to hold data, and moreover how to use some of NET's more advances features like Reflection and Attributes to assist in the creation of this code. To me, the chapter outlining this process was worth the price of the book alone. Like I said, it is absolutely unique. Most writers, perhaps because of a lack of in-depth understanding, just rehash the ADO.NET Dataset concept. But you can do so much more with NET that anyone concerned with building a proper DAL would do themselves a dissservice if they skipped over ""C# and the NET Framework""."
1,A Disappointment,"This is a very ""silly"" book. Try to imagine the awkwardness of reading a book about a Doctor who treats a ""Hoarse Horse"", to a three to five year old and you will realise you have to constantly stop and explain the wordplay to a young child who has no idea what the whole thing is about, and you get the picture! I can't imagine that the author ever had or read to a three year old, or she wouldn't have written this book. The story then goes on to a owl who says ""What"", instead of ""Who"", and as you can imagine this whole Abbott and Costello routine is just a big confusion for a small child! Put this in the category of, ""What were they thinking?"""
1,A non-rating,"The photographs of The Boulder House featured on pages 40-41 credited to Hart W. Empie are not his photos. Empie is a professional photographer and would not have allowed a paper trash bag to appear in one of his images. Further, the image on page 41 is reversed. The reproduction of the photos of The Boulder House is of the poorest quality. Other images are blurred as well. (see p. 161) Didn't anyone edit this publication?"
4,Great Rosin,"This rosin really works well! It goes on smoothly, and creates a nice warm, resonating tone. I use to use Jade rosin, but this is a bit cheaper and still works great! My only complaint is that the padding of the cloth is a bit bulky, so it makes it a bit hard to tie up, but I will manage."
1,visually all wrong - not Korean,"I cannot believe my eyes. The author who has no clue about Korean culture and wrong illustrations ruins what could have been a wonderful story. At first, I thought it was a book about Indian culture. I am pretty upset that this is the second time this author has done this with different publishers. Her first one was so awful that it was written up as a book to avoid in the Asian American Librarian Newsletter. Vote with your money. Please skip this title. King Sejong is credited with invention of Korean letters. If you want authentic books try recommendations from Asia for Kids. If you are a Korean or Korean American, please write to the publisher. I am posting my comment to the Planet Feedback's website."
4,Great Evidence & Research,"This was a awesome documentary.......not only was there alot of evidence,paperwork & visual clarity, there was also good interviews by character players in deathrow personal & security team.....you will be amazed about some of the things was never released to the public. A must see for people who wants the true behind what really happen that night in Vegas."
1,tupac assassination,Very disappointed with tupac assassination 2 didn't reveal nothing new a lot of old stuff bonus material was garbage...contained a lot of part 1 in it...don't waste your money
4,Peter the Great - A Larger than Life Figure in History,"The life of Peter the Great is too complex to fit into even a 6 hour movie. This movie succeeds in providing a framework for understanding the main elements. However, the decision makers chose to exclude the founding of St. Petersburg and kept the focus in Moscow.The actor who played the role of Peter as a young man (around 20) did a magnificent job of portraying his personality."
5,WILL IT EVER BE ON DVD ?,"Entirely informative as to how Russia was dragged out of the Dark Ages. Scenery is beautiful. Well acted. Based on fact. This TV miniseries ranks with the best of movies, yet no one will market it on DVD. Are they afraid it might sell like ""hotcakes""?"
3,"Peter the Great miniseries, one VHS tape","I purchased this excellent miniseries and was surprised to see all six hours of it condensed to one VHS tape. My previous copy was three tapes recorded at SP; this one appears to be in EP mode and the final hour has unreal tracking problems.....rendering the climax of the story almost unwatchable. I don't fault the person who sold it to me, because it appeared shrink-wrapped and in ostensibly new condition. However, I am striving to find the same title on DVD. I will drop another $35.00 to get a copy that works well. Atticus62"
5,Great!,I love this cd! I'm a chiropractor and have been playing the cd in my office -- Many people have commented on how much they like it. It combines various instruments making a unique listening experience. I love it -- you will too.
1,A bit disappointing,"My daughter received this CD player exactly one year ago as a gift. She absolutely loves it! Unfortunately, I don't. It simply stopped working this morning. I have tried several different CD's and several sets of batteries, but it will not work. We are now shopping for a new CD player. Also, when it did work, it skipped constantly if moved at all. My daughter was quite careful with it, knowing that if it broke it would not be able to be repaired. I think that for the high price tag it should be much more durable and certainly last longer that a year."
4,"Get an adapter, but OK otherwise","I bought this CD player for my 2-year-old daughter for Xmas. She's treated it with kid gloves for the last six months - she doesn't drag it around, and it sits on a shelf in her bedroom and its only used at night - so I've only got one problem with it, and two observations.1. Get an AC adapter. You will need a full change of batteries after three or four nights of use. Its difficult to find these adapters, though, unless you know where you're looking.2. Get used to listening to the same album/songs over and over again.3. Its best to use ripped/copied CDs. While my daughter is gentle with the player, CDs are not so lucky. So its much easier to just rip a new copy of her favorite CD when the old one has been scratched and scuffed, than it is to go buy a brand new copy of the thing."
1,Terrible CD player!,"This is terrible CD player. As others accurately wrote, if you moved the player slightly, it either skipped or stopped working altogether. The manufacturer should be ashamed of the quality and seriously think about taking it off the market. Hugh, hugh disappointment!"
1,NOT WORTH THE AGGREVATION,I GOT THIS ITEM FOR MY SON AND SORRY TO SAY. IT NEVER WORKED. AND THE C D DOOR FELL OFF. I SAW THIS ITEM IN A MAGAZINE AND WAS SO EXCITED. THIS WAS SHORT LIVED. AND SO WAS THIS ITEM.
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!,"When I first saw this cd player right away I thought it was way over priced, but it was the only one I could find available to buy for my 4yr old daughter who loves to sing. After much thought I decided to buy it. Big Mistake!! She loves it but it has many problems. The two biggest being: if you move it, even slightly the cd will skip...this becomes very frustrating to a 4yr old or an adult. Also, it is very difficult to put the cd in. The front does not open very far and you can barely get the cd in. I wish I would have waited for a better one to become available. Not worth the price I paid."
4,Morricone Greatest Hits,"This double-cd is nothing less than a bargain. Deborah's theme and Cockey's theme from Once upon a time in America is together with Gabriel's oboe from The Mission the highlights on this cd.Also included is the wonderful theme from Once upon a time in the west, another Sergio Leone film, and Moses theme.If you want a kind of Morricones greatest hits - buy this one."
3,No Fistful of Ennio,"Ennio Morricone wrote great soundtrack music, that's for certain. But no retrospective of his work is complete without the inclusion of more than one lone example from the three mid-60's ""spaghetti westerns"" he scored for Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood. Anyone familiar with the UNITED ARTISTS label LPs of ""Fistful Of Dollars,"" ""For A Few Dollars More"" and ""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"" might agree with this.As for what's here-- most of ENNIO MORRICONE * FILM MUSIC Volume 1 is forgettable incidental stuff. Except for ""The Battle Of Algiers (Theme),"" the opening and closing tracks are the best. They bookend what turns out to be a disappointing collection, lacking in both liner notes and the brilliance Morricone demonstrated over a 30 year span."
4,"This is good but he has made better ""Things"".","Ennio Moricone is one of the greatest composers in Modern music. I fell in love with his music at the age of 12 when I saw the greatest Spaghetti Westerns of all time fearturing the only actor who could pull it off...Clint Eastwood was excellent as the ""Man with no name"" and Morricone's music only made the experience more thrilling. But, I do not know if you all have had the pleasure of watching John Carpenter's classic ""The Thing"" in which Morricone composed the creepiest soundtrack I have ever heard. The Thing is a fantastic alien film and Ennio's music made that movie an unforgettable cult classic..........I beg the execs at CD now to bring back that soundtrack or does anyone out there know how I can obtain it? As I was told it was out of print."
2,not as described,like some others i received the wrong item yellow cord twice. call reliance controls and they said they would extend the 2 year warranty that comes with the yellow cord to 5 years. i am going to hold on to the cord and hope amazon gets their act together and offers the cord i ordered for the same price. it it being listed right now through a outside seller for 50 dollars more plus 20 for shipping.this cord seems very stiff but well built.
3,Good Cord but....,"Like others I received a 50 foot version of a generic power cord in yellow instead of the PC3040 cord I ordered. The shipping box appeared to have photocopied labels from a PC3040 cord.The cord I received was made in China (of course) and seemed to me to be more generic than the Reliance Controls Brand I was expecting.While the cord is heavy duty, extra long and will do the job, I was a little disappointed I did not receive exactly what I ordered. I kept it because I can use the extra length and the price was ok...."
5,Great Power Cord !,"In buying my 5600w generator I was searching for a Power Cord for it. I came across the Reliance Controls 40' L14-30 cord (PC3040). I was able to order this from Amazon and have it shipped to Canada cheaper than it would've been to buy it from the Canadian Distributor. Great deal!! The parts at Home Depot just the male & female ends were $38 each, and that did not include the 10/4 wire. The only negative is the ends were not attached together, so one of the prongs were slightly bent."
1,Don't hold your breath,"I'd love to make a review, but since it hasn't shipped after 6 weeks with no indication when available, overall, it stinks."
5,good solid cable,"good solid cable, the price is right - shipped fast and works perfect. I use this to run power from my generator to the box and it works perfect."
4,good,"item arrived promptly and worked as expected. i would reccomend this product to anyone needing a power cord for such a great deal, Thank you"
1,Not for those looking for Home Birth information!,"This book does no service to the Home Birth community. If you are looking for information on all facets of birth in a MEDICAL setting, then this book would be for you. Home birth facilitators would never recommend some of the practices in this book. (The Zanelli technique, for instance. Which is when you have a baby that's head has delivered but the shoulders are stuck, and it shows you how to push the baby back inside the womb.Or as already mentioned, Circumcision.) This book would be useful for those birth facilitators that intend to practice exclusively in a hospital setting."
2,"Technically accurate, boring read","I am impressed by Varney's vast knowledge of hospital procedures as they relate to midwifery care. However, I found this to be ""textbook"" as a very boring read. Her information did not really cover the practice outside the hospital setting as thoroughly as would be needed for someone praticing in that setting. Her information would be most appreciated by the CNM and the L&D nurse - a great resource for them."
2,Decent for what it is,"I agree with many concerns posted here and as a nurse midwife student find the text to be useful but dry and very hospital-focused. An added downside is that as this book ages, more and more of it becomes outdated and many portions of it need new evidence based material. There are multiple errors and I have many notes written in to correct either typos or incorrect (or not current evidence based) practices.It is truly frustrating that for nurse midwife students Varney is the golden-standard. I am a bit jealous of direct entry and CPM's who use the Frye text- most likely a better choice!Here's for crossing my fingers in hope that the next addition of Varney will re-inspire hope!"
2,Caught a major error,"On page 556 of this book, I caught an error which the authors probably would want to have stricken from the book because it does not match their pro-abortion, pro-contraception, pro-liberal and antiChristian philosophy:""Growth and development begin with the moment of fertilization and the fusion of the female and male pronuclei from the ovum and sperm, respectively. This fusion produces a single cell called a zygote. AT THIS MOMENT a NEW INDIVIDUAL IS CREATED, WITH HIS OR HER OWN GENETIC MAKE UP AS DETERMINED BY THIS TOTALLY NEW COMBINATION OF CHROMOSOMES AND GENES.""What!!! it is a PERSON FROM THE INSTANT OF FERTILIZATION, AS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH TEACHES??? How on earth did the authors miss this glaring unscientific error?OH...Wait....that means it is fact...the unborn child is a PERSON!"
1,Does not fit larger panels as advertised,"I feel compelled to add another review that encourages you to check for compliance before you purchase. My new 42"" LCD panel will not attach to this mount because the mount is too small. Seems like it would be fine for small panels."
1,Not Universal,"I am not complaining about the quality of this product, as it seems to be made well. However, it is not universal as the company states. I thought I would save some money buying this, but it is nowhere NEAR big enough for my 42"" TV. The part that mounts to the wall is literally 8"" too short. If you have anything over 20 inches, don't make my mistake. Check your manual for the best mount first...I wish I had."
4,sun tach on my spitfire dash,I bought this tach for 2 reasons ; 1 i remember the name from the past everybody had a sun tach on their dash and 2 the price and the fact that i needed an electric tach to replace my mech. tach ; only thing i don't like is Sun is no longer made in the USA its from china ; so when i have the extra money i will change over to Auto-meter but for now it works.
3,Late and a little rough,I ordered this item about three weeks ago and was very excited to get it within the first week. It showed up 2 and a half weeks late and the poster had been bent a little and i wasn't happy. I will not be buying anything from poster revolution for a very long time.
3,"Great tou, but too few poeces","Great toy, but its got way too few dominoes. You can easily run out after putting them all up in 10 minutes."
1,Don't waste your life on Mythology,"It's a fact that Yahweh is a fictional character. One only has to critically read the Bible to find the the book is full of errors, contradictions, and mistakes. Live your life as if today was your last and stop waiting on an unproven afterlife."
1,don't waste your money,"This is quite possibly the most judgmental, negative, callous dismissal of non-Christians I have ever read. I think Christ would be saddened by Piper's 'ministry' which revolves around the idea that he, and he alone, gets to decide whose life is watsed and whose is not. Christ stood for loving acceptance of the unique gifts each of us brings-- not to herald one (mortal) man like Piper the ability to judge everyone and everything around him as worthy, or not. He's also obviously anti-intellectual, dismissing post-modernism and many of the ways that postmodern thinking has richened our cultural experience. He's clearly a scared and bitter white man with a major chip on his shoulder. I am very disheartened by the idea that these are the book 'Christians' are reading to inform their faith and practice."
5,fantastic book of life-changing truth.,Solid and challenging to my core. I knew there had to be more to a life in Christ than the standard church experience.
5,Very Encouraging & Inspiring Book!,I read this book a while back and was really encouraged by it. It's revolutionary. It's inspiring. Life is FAR too short to not be lived to the hilt. I would highly recommend this book to anyone! Get inspired to make the most of your life today for God's glory!
3,Good name but writing style very shaky,"The name created for this book is quite memorable, however the huge drawback to this book is the poor writing style, and that this book is way too academic. The most important chapter to me was chapter 8 which is on work. Piper used lots of big words, and it was just hard to grasp his writing style. Instead I found the book ""Disciplines of a Godly Man"" far more helpful than this one. That author writes more effectively and does not use as many big words."
3,so-so,"Piper's main point is excellent: We need to live our lives with a focus on eternal value. While I got several good principles out of the book, and I didn't disagree with anything he said, it just didn't seem to flow. Several paragraphs (even chapters) didn't gel for me. This WAS time better spent than watching television, but would I buy it knowing what I know now? no. Am I recommending it to my friends? no."
4,be careful,"The book's corner edges got a little roughed up, through shipping process I suspect. But doesn't bother me. Shipped in good time! Yeah."
2,Book,This book was not what I expected - too religious I guess for my taste. I expected less scripture than there was
1,Judgmental and arrogant,"The book itself has a few good points but John piper comes across extremely judgmental and arrogant. The first example of a ""wasted life"" is a couple who retired well that he read about in readers digest. I am sorry but I don't think John piper is god a can determine the state of someone's heart while reading about them. He is not an eloquent writer so it isn't that good of a read anyway."
5,Worth a little time,"Those familiar with Piper have come to expect Scripture saturated pleadings to readers to find their ultimate fulfillment and joy in ""all that God is for us in Christ."" For those unfamiliar with Piper, he is a passionate writer and pastor who spurs his readers to greater depths of devotion to God and sacrificial living. He is typically motivating and convicting.In this book, short by Piper's standards, he drives home the biblical principle that we must give up our lives to find them. Piper applies this passion for Christ in different areas of life: work, relationships, missions, etc. The chapters on risk-taking and work are alone worth the price of the book. I highly reccommend this book as a gift for graduates and college students, but it is worth reading for every believer who doesn't want to waste their life."
5,Only what's done for Christ will last,"I find this book a modern day call equal to William Law's,A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life. Dr. Piper's passion for the essence and main point of life are evident in this work of challenge. I was actually sad when I finished the book because I didn't want the book to end. When I read Dr. Piper's words, scripture is clearer and I am refueled and ready to offer Christ my whole life. It is ALL by grace but here is a man who is not afraid to give us guidelines to what a Christian might look like. His challenge is for both the ""young"" and ""old."" He addresses those who would serve God in their jobs and those that God might call to missionary service. You will also be challenged in your use of money and whatever ""shells"" you might be prone to collect. I know God will be honored by this book. Do you want to hear, ""Well done, good and faithful servant""? Please, read this book."
3,very discouraging,"I gave the book three stars only because I believe the content is biblical and important. But I almost put this book down when I was three quarters of the way through it. Piper just seems to set such an impossibly high standard for Christian living, one that I feel I could never attain no matter how hard I tried. And the book left me feeling a little like when I was a kid and brought home a report card to my father that was mostly A's but had one or two B's on it - not good enough. I don't think that's the way my heavenly father is looking at me, and I don't think I have to be perfect to win his approval. His son has already done that for me. The only chapter I could really relate to was chapter 8 on living for Christ in the secular workplace. Other than that, I felt like he was saying that if you weren't involved with world missions or hadn't emptied your checking account for the cause of Christ, you were more or less wasting your life. And I just can't buy that."
5,Valuable Teaching,"John Piper's Don't Waste Your Life has had a profound effect on my life. The author points out that it is easy to slip through life without doing anything that involves a risk and without stepping out of a comfort zone. At the end of life, what can a person who has lived in such a selfish pattern say when he faces Christ? It is possible to be a nominal Christian but to live only in a self-seeking way. John Piper is pleading for his listeners to make this life count for something that glorifies God. He explains what it means to glorify God, a phrase which is often used but seldom understand. Every Christian today has opportunities to make life matter."
4,Bob Jones Span.1 review,"I personally like the arrangement of the material in this text. I think someone without Spanish speaking experience would have a challenging time teaching with this curriculum though. It isn't watered down, and it is fairly fast paced. However, it covers writing, reading, speaking, and listening skills."
4,Fit the TV perfectly,"Of course, As mentioned in other reviews, with the mounting options and included hardware it would probably fit any TV perfectly. Includes most of the tools necessary as well."
3,Mormon expulsion from Missouri,"The story of mormon and gentile differences in Missouri around 1838 even though the book doesn't disclose any dates, possibly if there was a dust jacket the information would have been on it. Historically factual with of course a romance involved, there are some shoot outs but the type of guns used are never mentioned which is a little odd to this reader."
5,A Wedding Gift,"I did a lot of comparison shopping for stainless tableware. The price was the best and the quality of this product I would have to say is excellent. I took out each piece and looked it over, not finding so much as one flaw. The pattern is beautiful, kind of looking like the sun shining on the ripples in a river. Its not the run of the mill pattern so if you like something a little different this is it."
1,Oh please,"This is a mediocre book, in a mediocre-to-poor series.McKenna made a huge mistake from the very beginning, messing with point of view and not building characters who were particularly endearing. The second book was a bad rehash of the first story from a different,if not interesting. perspective.There is an amateurish feel to all of Ms. McKenna's books, which for some reason we have read in our SFF readers' group. This is bad mass market paperback stuff; if your taste runs to that, you may enjoy it. If you prefer some talent and some skill in your writers, well, look elsewhere."
3,LET'S COUNT IT AGAIN!,"If you are not saturated with the presidential election saga in the year 2000, then jump into the fray again with this book. Who won what? Why? and Why not?. Miss Dionne re-visits the Florida vote count, and re-count debacle, and gives a fairly interesting assessment of the election process. You know what they say about an educated consumer, well the same applies to an educated voter. Knowledge is power. This is a well researched book. A fine commentary on politics at its highest, most intense, most competitive level."
1,The facts about BIll Kristol,"Before you even think of buying this book, do a little research about who Bill Kristol really is. Kristol is a flunky for rich right-wingers, whose career is underwritten by ultra-conservative, tax-exempt foundations.Be a smart consumer and an educated reader. Know the bias of an author before you read their work. To review a full report on Kristol's background, go to:http://www.mediatransparency.org/people/bill_kristol.htm"
1,DOES NOT ACCEPT 1080p SIGNAL!,"Hi, people.I've just talked to toshiba center and they told me the TV actually does not accept the 1080p video input. They say it's ""1080p"" because it always shows 1920x1080 no matter what is the input signal, but it's an interpolation of it... they confirmed that the TV DOES NOT ACCEPT 1080P INPUT SIGNAL.The TV is fine, but i'm VERY DISAPPOINTED with its description. This ""1080p"" name is a durty sales strategy. I was looking for a true 1080p television (that can truly accept a 1080p input) and i bought this one and now i would spend at least 400 bucks returning the TV and buying a new one... result: i'll keep this TV, but unsatisfied... i've been made a fool.If you're gonna buy this product, be aware of this issue."
1,Good TV; stay away from Toshiba customer service/repair,"This is a nice TV for the money, but mine died during the warranty period and it has been almost 2 months and still no repair. Multiple emails and phone calls to Toshiba tech support/customer service and the local authorized service provider has resulted in the major run-around and no fix. I still have no idea when the unit will be returned to me. Back ordered parts were received DOA and had to be sent back, tech people cannot figure out what is wrong with the TV, yet Toshiba refuses to do the right thing and replace the unit. I will never purchase another Toshiba product. And if you do and it needs service, be prepared to be without your product for a long time. Sorry, Toshiba, this just isn't good enough when people spend their hard-earned cash with you!"
4,"toshiba 42hl196 42"" LCD HDTV cable card","The only reason I give this product 4 stars is because of the HDTV cable card. Often, when turned on, the TV fails to activate a picture. We have to remove the card, wait a minute, reinsert the card,and let the TV re-boot, otherwise it is a great product. If anyone has a solution we would be happy to know about it."
1,A pitty.,"This book I would rank very high in my top 10 all time worst buys. I'm not talking books only here. It's very ad-hoc random-like structure and utter shallownes makes this book completely unusable for Solaris users on all levels, from beginner on to - most certainly - advanced.Winsor's book simply isn't up to par to what you'd expect from Sun Mycrosystem Press. It certainly doesn't beat the freely available Admin Guides, also from Sun. My advice to anybody looking for a desktop reference guide is either to download the pdf's from Sun or to buy the hardcopy edition."
1,Non Techies do not write good Techie books.,"Having been previously dissapointed by other books by the same author I was not suprised to find the uadmin(1m) command described as a ""user administration command"" in the command index.""...1,600 pages of rock-solid information on 550+ commands""cp man pages && make_money"
5,Comfortable Relief,"This is the best thing I have ever taken for constipation. It will work within 24 hours with no extreme urgency, no runs, no cramping; just a comfortable, significant bowel movement. It's been around forever, but only reappeared when cleansing came on the scene. Love it!!!"
3,Self-priming if it's already wet,"All the literature on the web (including manufacturer's website) says this is a ""self priming"" pump. However, the instructions in the pump packaging tell the rest of the story. The inlet to the pump must be pretty much directly attached to a low point in a water tank for the ""self priming"" to occur.Didn't/couldn't use the pump because I needed to pull water up about 2 feet during priming. Returned the item. I'll be looking at diaphragm pumps now.Shipping/delivery was timely. Product condition (exterior) was good."
4,Great customer service,"I didn't get around to hooking up this pump for a couple months so it was out of Amazon return window. When I finally did, it leaked. Emailed the company and they promptly sent a brand new one without any hassle. New one works great. I'll definitely be checking out Attwood next time I need a pump."
2,Received a defective item,"Cannot review this item, the unit was not working (used a 12V 4A power supply). Wrote to Attwood and they suggested that wires could have been inverted during assembly, but the item was already returned when the response arrived. Bought a Flojet and it's working like a charm.So if you have this pump in hand and it's not working, try switching the wires. Very quiet."
5,The Ultimate in Science Fiction Reference Material,"Though this book only brings us up to 1979, it is the ultimate reference for determining true first editions by Science Fiction's finest. As with the previous reviewer, I'd love to see this book updated."
4,Good quality knife.,The serrated edge of this knife makes it effective for many textures of breads. The quality is similar to other Henckels Five Star knives.
3,Motorola PEBL U6 swivel holster,"Having owned a similar holster for a Motorola MPX220, I thought this holster would work out very well. It does handle the job of securing the phone firmly and ratchets in 6 positions however unlike the MPX220 holster you cannot open the phone while in the holster. The top locking tabs at first does not fit the phone well, you must force the phone into place. The tabs tend to catch on the rubber cover for the power cord input, you cannot charge it while in the holster unlike the MPX220 holster design. Overall its serviceable and does the job, but I was disappointed that it was not a bit more versatile. Its not the holster's fault though, more of a design flaw of the PEBL in order to keep it sleek and uniform I suppose (that and that you need a new type of charger input.)"
5,If you only buy one knife,I received this knife for Christmas last year and it is by far the best knife I have ever had. It is the perfect size for all cutting needs in the kitchen. I have litterly used it every day and it is as sharp today as it was the day I received it. This is the perfect gift for anyone who enjoys the kitchen.
4,Good quality knife.,"I find this knife very easy to control, as any good paring knife should be. The quality is similar to other Henckels Five Star knives."
5,new king of the low-life,"I've read some heavy and powerful poetry in my time--Bill Shields jumps to mind--but with STONE HOTEL, Raegan Butcher jumps to the frontlines of the poetry game. This book is raw, tough and describes some fairly lurid situations with candor and clarity. Notably absent is any trace of self-pity, which is remarkable considering the subject matter. If you like Bukowski, Leonard Cohen or Bill Shields, you'll like this book. Too often, prisoner writing is single-minded, meaningless or cliche. Too often, prisoner writing reflects an air of angry anti-establishment propaganda or justification for crime. Raegan Butcher seems to have no motives beyond providing insights to life behind bars--insights from the mind of someone unnaturally forced to bear the countenance and tone of dispassionate nihilism."
4,Christian faith apart from organized religion,"This book provides an important resource for the Christian community. Kanzo Uchimura was a Japanese Christian prophet whose life still influences culture in his homeland. Because his works are not available in English, Miura's book provides access to non-Japanese people. Uchimura developed the concept of Mukyokai, the non-church Christian movement. To this day tens of thousands of believers in Japan worship in homes and rented public spaces. Without ordained clergy or church organizations, the people provide each other with nurture in faith."
2,Not worth it.,"I used this because I didn't like the ""starter"" rosin that came with my new violin+bow, and found that it doesn't preform any better (or worse). In fact it gets more dust on my violin than the freebie one did. I think it may be better to just go ahead and get the good stuff like Jade and not play around with this. Its disappointing to waste money on it."
5,The summit of classic Louisville alternative,"No mere reunion, this 1994 release documents why the Babs were the pinnacle of the region's early alternative music. Mainstays of late '70's and early '80's Louisville, New York and expanded scenes, this band defined and expanded the freewheeling punk style. Furious feedback guitars from goddess Tara Key, driving bass from Tim Harris, Sean Mulhall's cracking yet syncopated drums, and Chip Nold's white soul screams melded hypercharged simple riffs into anthems. Songs: My Friend Roger: ""the Kentucky Louie Louie"" (per Tony Briggs) - a definitive show stopper; When I'm Home: the original single got the BDB on the cover of the Village Voice, bigger than life, around 1980; Leave: cover of proteges Your Food's artsy shuffle; Bold Beginnings, Shively Spleen, SHAKE, it all rocks your world.Also check out many other albums by Tim & Tara & others with Antietam, Tara's solo albums, Tim & Tara co-wrote ""CBGB's"" with Syd Straw...."
5,Gates belts are great!,Bought this to put on our Lexus. Been running Gates belts for years on our other vehicles. They hold up very well.
5,Most helpful in understanding basic concepts of security.,Having read many other books on general security I needed information on access control systems and networking with our MIS department. This book gave all of us on the commitee the ability to better understand and design our overall system so we could get the best price performance from our vendors.
5,The Surveyor's Bible,"While preparing for my licensing exam, I read this book from cover to cover. It addresses every principle of retracement (sequential and simultaneous conveyances), public lands, and riparian issues thoroughly. The highlighted ""principle"" at the heading of each new topic makes remembering the main points simple. I can honestly say that every question on the NCEES exam that dealt with general principles and practice was answered in this book. I passed on my first sitting, and this book was one of the main reasons why. If you can only study one reference, this is it. Every practicing surveyor should also refer to it regularly."
5,Worth every penny,"I have used this book in 4 classes, so far. It was required for 2. I have used it as a reference in several school projects. Great for anyone in Land Boundary work or someone working in Land Law. Also, has some good references in it for you to use."
3,Average,"Some stuff seems archaic, but some other stuff kind of difficult to decipher, but pertinent."
3,I hope you like slime mold,"First, I hope you like ants and slime mold. That is how the book starts. The surprise is that this is a good start. You always here books as described as thought provoking, it has become quite a cliché, but this book IS thought provoking. As I read this book, I would find myself thinking the next day of some of its implications.The only criticism I could make of this book is that the author spends too much time on some topics. He seemed to dwell on the SIMS far too long. It also ended more with a whimper than a bang. Yeah the Internet is going to be really neat and we are going to be able watch Sponge Bob Square Pants whenever we want. Hurrah.I guess what is so disappointing about the end of the book is that the rest of it is so good. What are self-organizing systems? How can we apply these principles to the Internet or just data in general? You should read this book."
4,Great Book,I read this about a year ago and purchased a copy for my girl friend. Very interesting and insightful perspective on life and organization.
1,Barely About Emergence,"The first part of the book is an adequate introduction to the concept of emergence, while the rest reads like a drawn out futurist essay. Immensely shallow. Should not have been published. Should not have been read (by me, at least)."
2,"The ""fast food"" review of complex adaptive systems (CAS)","Steven Johnson writes well. His analogies, metaphors and phrases all work. But the book itself has very, very little content. Interesting factoid here; tidbit there, but just like fast food, it tastes good but is devoid of any nutrition."
2,light reading... very light,"I was disappointed with this book. A little too narrative.Wanders a bit and is unfocused.There are absolutely no diagrams, pictures, graphs, graphicsnothing. The topic of emergence is a lot more interestingthan you would get from this book."
3,Realworld Examples of Emergence,"The book is written around the device of using real-world experiences familiar to all of us as a way of making such topics as chaos theory, complexity, and complex adaptive systems less abstract and more tangible.Two I especially like are:- that the contemporary 'media-sphere'(all the news-outlets) is actually a complex system that is overloaded with positive-feedback and lacks the brakes or baffles of negative feedback. Citing the Gennifer Flower story, he illustrates what happens when positive feedback is unchecked by the mittigating effects of the countervailing forces of negative feedback.- that the city is an information-processing system that captures, encodes, makes persistent and delivers massive amounts of information, allowing man, whose mind evolved to handle the comparatively simple social complexity of Stone Age-era groups consisting of less than 200 people roaming the savannas of Africa, to develop into ever larger communities."
4,Three simple - and very useful - ideas,"An interesting book, but not necessarily one in which you need to read every word. In fact, if you skim, speed read, or photo-read - the simple ideas - well, they emerge from the text. Johnson explains the properties of emergent systems - positive and negative feedback loops, neighbor interaction, and pattern recognition. With just these three ideas he describes a range of very interesting behaviors including ant colonies, the development of neighborhoods and cities, genetic algorithms, collaborative filtering and online communities - even games. While somewhat antithetical to strategic business design - exploiting the properties of self-organizing systems can be a very profitable strategy unto itself (witness Ebay) this book should be read by online and offline marketers looking for the next model to replace advertising, as well as product designers, organizational development consultants, community activists, and people who like neat ideas."
3,Enjoyable but shallow,"I enjoyed this book, but the treatment was very shallow. Just as the text gets interesting, the author switches topics. For example, in his discussions of harvesters ants research he mentions some pretty amazing conclusions, but never describes any of the experiments that led to them."
2,A readable dissapointment,"While I did finish the book, I was hoping for something a bit deeper. My impression is that Steven Johnson has read widely and, enthralled by the connection, wanted to try to bring them together. Either a more serious study or perhaps some insightful research of his own would have been helpful.I expect I'll read some of the texts cited in the book, but wouldn't recommend this in hardback unless you are about to take a long plane flight and are too tired to read anything heavy.My taste runs more to Martin Gardner (Wheels, Life ...), John Allen Paulos, Steven Pinker (Language Instinct over How the Mind Works)."
3,Dated but not yet quaint,"If I had read this book when it came out in 2002 it would have been eye-opening, but in the four years since a lot of Johnson's ideas have seeped through the culture and media. It's still exciting to think about the ways that emergence and swarm theories link such initially unlikely things as ants, cities, brains, and computers, but once Johnson suggests the associations early in the book, the reader readily makes the connection. After that, it's simply a matter of examining other examples and nodding sagely, noting how quaint software like Sim City and Logo seems after four years. One of the virtues of contemporary non-fiction is that it can be skimmed easily. This book isn't old enough to be a classic nor new enough to cut much edge. Johnson's prose is easy to read, though - he tells jokes enough to keep the reader amused and he doesn't take himself so seriously that you feel lost or dumb. But I wouldn't spend much time with this book."
2,Disappointment,"I saw Steven Johnson's lively and a compellingly fascinating presentation on the topic of the book at a conference, which inspired my desire to read his book.Unfortunately, the 250+ pages of the book provide very little insight beyond a 30+ minute presentation. The writing style is not forceful or engaging, but rather dull and lifeless. The lasting feeling is that the author is attempting to make the book accessible to a group of smart 10 year olds by using short sentences, simple vocabulary and endlessly repeating the same ideas over and over again.The initial excitement wears off after about first 50 pages and the impetus to try to read it would help you stumble through the drudgery of another 50 pages, but except to give up sometime soon afterwards."
3,Sound and Fury...,"Is emergence a true phenomonon outside of personal experience or a cognitive adaptation solely within personal experience?This work is a finely told tale of the phenomenon of emergent behavior. How things develop to form something complex not readily apparent from its constituent parts or beginnings. Steven Johnson is thorough, appealing, and clear in his writing. I found this work interesting and engaging. I recommend it to all.My one criticism of this book is a personal one, not one of error on the author's part. I found this work to be too personality driven. It felt to me to be too much about individual characters and less about ideas. In fact, I think if the actual ideas were distilled from this work the amount would be less than the book suggests. Even with that said, I still think this is a valuable and insightful work."
4,Nice soft intro to concepts of self-organisation,"For those with a technical interest in the matter, this is a nice soft intro to the topics with which concerned. It is written with a somewhat emotional style; probably not an ideal technical resource.For the readers not akin to the concepts at all, the book successfully conveys a nice (and vitally important) way of interpreting natural phenomena (that of self-organisation, collective intelligence, etc.), but, through its somewhat emotional style, may create a sort of hype around the concept.A pleasant and fast read, over-all; worth it."
4,Good guide to how technology may bring people together,"Steven Johnson is an observer of technology and how man finds new ways to adapt it to his needs. He has just the right amount of detachment to see how what's to come meshes with what has been. This ""big picture"" is what makes reading his work so easy. He takes concepts and ideas that we are already familiar with from our regular routines and explains how technology is trying to solve the same problems. This makes it easy to understand. Emergence is one of those rare books that is at once a cheerleader for man's ingenuity and has the stats and facts to back them up.Mr. Johnson's ideas about how social networks emerge and bend new technology to their needs is compelling and hopeful.I've been a fan of his since his days at FEED. If only the web's best online magazine, FEED, had found the resources to carry on."
2,A readable dissapointment,"While I did finish the book, I was hoping for something a bit deeper. My impression is that Steven Johnson has read widely and, enthralled by the connections, wanted to try to bring several ideas together. Either a more serious study or perhaps some insightful research of his own would have been helpful.I expect I'll read some of the texts cited in the book, but wouldn't recommend this in hardback unless you are about to take a long plane flight and are too tired to read anything heavy....."
3,Kind of a let down,"I was hoping for an in depth look at emergence theory but this book is definitely more of a light read than a scientific text. I learned more about emergence theory from the few pages of text in wikipedia than I did from this book. It contains a wealth of examples and anecdotes which at least makes it enjoyable, but doesn't really approach anything which could be labeled science or even philosophy. If you're just casually interested in emergence this is probably an ideal book, but for those of you looking for something more, look elsewhere."
3,Fact checking,"I've only read the first chapter so please ignore the 3-star rating; Amazon requires one. I just wanted to point out one error.Johnson describes a single-celled creature called a slime mold, which -- in a nicely phrased passage -- ""may someday be seen as the equivalent of the finches and tortoises that Darwin observed on the Galápagos Islands.""He's right, but he also conflates two very different organisms -- Dictyostelium and Phylarum. Confusingly, both of them are called slime molds, and are being studied for network insight; but they belong to different classes of the animal kingdom. To us they're slime, but scientifically one may as well be a mammal and the other a fish. Johnson mixes up their life cycles, and doesn't seem to realize that he's talking about two different entities.He talks about them wonderfully, and this doesn't necessarily reflect on the rest of the book; just wanted to pass this on."
3,Not enough emergence,"I was prepared to like this book since it deals Emergence, a subject I'm interested in. Some parts of this book are relevant, such as stories about ants, slime molds, Starlogo, the Sims, the Gearhead toys, while other parts seem to be included to philosophize about how various aspects of life have some hints of Emergence (or is it evolution?), such as cities (on and on), computers, the world wide web, chimpanzees, and much more. I thought about a third of the book was interesting enough to read intently, and I used speed reading (or page skipping) to go through the rest of the book. In short, some interesting Emergence, but not enough. This is a fine book to get from the library or to buy used."
2,Mediocre At Best,"Johnson has a riveting introduction and opening but the rest of the book falls flat with a superficial treatment of emergence. The author would also have the reader think that he knows alot about cities and their development, but his actual understanding of the subject is very, very thin.Try ""Signs of Life"" by Richard Sole and Brian Goodwin for a much better elucidation of complexity science and the role of emergence. Another book just out is ""Self Organization in Biological Systems"" published by Princten University Press as part of its series on complexity science."
2,Do yourself a favor and stop after Chapter 3,"The first chapter will pique your interest. The next two chapters will present interesting examples of emergent behavior. The remainder of the book will likely leave you feeling frustrated at the poor presentation and disappointed at the lack of follow-through on your expectations from chapter 1. The density of useful information drops precipitously as the book progresses, degrading to something at or below what you would expect to read in a blog (I'm serious). I must admit I haven't been able to finish the last chapter."
3,Not great; not bad; Chatty update to Out of Control,"This book is neither as good or as bad as the other reviewers are making it out to be. It is a collection of descriptions of applications of swarm behavior. I can see where hard core defenders of chaos and complexity theories may think is is too folksy. And I can see where people not familiar with any of this would have a gee whiz attitude.I personally think this a useful and pleasant, if chatty update to Kevin Kelly's phenomenal book, Out of Control."
1,Just a bunch of pseudo-scientific nonsense.,"... Basically, it uses some catchy phrases or ideas from chaos theory and the field of complex emergent systems to REPLACE the very phenomena it needs to explain. Alternatively, one finds ""emergence"" also used as a replacement word for things like consciousness, intelligence, and mind so it really explains nothing at all and just abuses language. Just another example of a book trying to give answers about phenomena which we really don't even know how to ask fundamental questions about...phenomena that may ultimately lie beyond our conceptual, rational grasp..."
2,This book just didn't connect much for me.,"I was excited when I picked up this book, but after reading it I feel it didn't introduce me to anything all that new.The chapters on ants and character recognition were pretty interesting, but everything else was really basic. He didn't back his statements up with concrete details or anything unique. Usually after reading a book like this I come away with a better understanding of the topic. After reading this I can't really say I learned much."
2,Patterns In Imagination,"Written during the height of the late Tech Bubble, it often seems to have more faith, in a secular way of course, in the imagined promises of technology in general and software in particular. The similes are compelling, and the parallels are intriguing, but there's always some nagging question on what it all means. None of the short-term predictions have come to pass, and the long-term predictions are more in the way of philosophical musings of the author. And, the almost child-like respect for computer simulations is questionable, particularly when presented without any supporting arguments or explanations. Not a book on technology as such, or anything really concrete or otherwise directly useful. Some of the points bring to mind the clashes between the Copenhagen and Gottingen schools when quantum mechanics was being conjured up. A good read for speculative background on artificial intelligence."
1,Written by a Novice.,"Emergence excited my imagination when I first heard of its scope. Unfortunately, it was written by a non-scientist that did little more than assemble bits and pieces of information about organized complexity. He is not knowledgeable enough in regards to the intricacies of this domain to convince a layman of his ability to lead them into this new science. In short, no new ground was broken or even adequately explored."
1,The Manual of Repitition,"This floppy paperback outlines several (not many) diving accidents. However, all of the information for each different diving accident is the same for each injury. Oxygen, warm blanket, keep calm, see doctor. Or if you have one of many types of abrasions, hot water, oxygen, keep warm, keep calm, see doctor. It's scope is very limited. Given the number and types of accidents that may occur on a dive, every injury is treated the same. The listing of problems was lacking, there was not a quick reference, and the information was redundant, You would be better off buying a first aid book, because this one is non-specific to diving injuries. It is disappointing coming from DAN, to write such an incomplete ""reference"" tool. This goes for the spiral bound editions that DAN puts out too. Very shallow (pun intended)."
1,Disappointed,"Unfortunately this book did nothing for me. I was looking for a beginners guide for ASP.Net that would get me started programming with C# while learning the features of .NET. I chose Wrox because I found some of their other books very useful.This book wastes alot of time on the Web Matrix which is both pretty useless for the beginner and the professional alike. If you are trying to be an ASP.Net professional, Visual Studio would be your choice. And if you are beginner you want to learn how to program the examples in C# rather than using the automated features of Web Matrix.Basically I am returning the book and will have to find another company to help me in my web development learning process."
1,"Rain, rain, Go away...","Inarguably pretentious.The Red Paintings, or Red Pastiches, are not in the least bit as innovative as so often self-promoted.Their explicit use of art to attempt to elevate some Blink182 with strings attached tripe is trite, an insult to actual innovation, wherein structure and technique should be ingenious."
5,first class wool blanket,This is a wonderful very fine weave wool blanket. It is a thin but very warm layer so the sheets under it are warm when you get in the bed.
1,RCA D770 Remote,Well this remote works great if u like reprograming your remote every month. So never lose the manual because no-one on the web has one.
3,Lovin it,I love the talking feature and the loudness. No mistaking this bad boy. Easy set up as well. Well after I call my uncle to ask what the plastic pieces (anchors) were for. :o)
1,Faulty monitor,I got this monitor for my kids room 1 month ago and yesterday it started chirping every 30 seconds. Went back to the manual to understand the reason for the chirp and found out that it translates to a fualt in the monitor and that i have to contact the manufacturer. For something that should prevent a life threatning incident.......well im not too impressed. Thank you Kidde.
4,Love it!,"I love the way Robert Feather writes, no theological confusion of philosophies here. I love the way he has put the pieces of his jigsaw puzzle together. Although you might not agree with all his conclusions he certainly presents a convincing argument. For anyone interested in our links to ancient Egypt, specifically with the 18th dynasty, who has an interest in the origins of the Bible stories and a fascination with the Dead Sea Scrolls, this book will certainly tantalize your enquiring tastebuds. And, there is treasure and a treasure hunt involved along side deeply spiritual teachings that have been found and lost and now in the 21st century found again. Perhaps the treasure is more in the teachings than in the gold."
1,I hated this,It may be better for people with dry skin. People with oily skin like me should really avoid this.It caused me severe pimples
1,Strong chemical fragrance :(,I was excited to receive my first bar of African black soap - but was disappointed as soon as I opened it. This soap has a very strong chemical fragrance which makes it unusable for me as a consumer. I will look for something else.
5,great for exzema,My boyfriend has psorisis and exzema real bad. I got him this and it has really helped relieve him of some pain and discomfort. He doesn't itch so much and I can see lots of improvement.
5,I love nature and herbs quick customers service in shipments and communications,"I love how nature and herbs gives out fantastic quick customer services, and excellent communications, KEEP UP THE EXCELLENT JOB!!!!! I GIVE YOU 2 THUMBS UP!!!!"
1,it sucks!,"I have been breaking out in hives and found that people were suggesting African Black Soap. So, I decided to try this product. It did not meet my expectations at all. It leaves black dye in the tub and everywhere else the suds go. Even though it reduced the itching, I was still breaking out in hives. I am using it until it finishes because I paid money for it. But, I will not be buying this product again and I do not recommend it to anyone. The only good thing about this product is that it leaves you so clean that you squeek."
4,Gives my skin a clean feeling,"I love this. Everytime i would get out the shower, my skin felt clean and nice. But i have to say i do prefer using Carley's Clear and Smooth Natural soap bar. I Love it way better than this soap and it think you would if you tried it."
2,Wrong item ordered,I purchased the African Black Soap. I was disappointed as it was the wrong one. I had gotten the soap before but it was green with oatmeal particles in it. I dont know which was the right package to order. Can anyone help. The one I got was actually black in color. I dont care for it as well.
3,Disappointed,I ordered two of the same product and I was disappointed that the screws were completely missing in one. This was an unopened package. I wanted to reorder but it was not in stock and not worth a refund.
5,I Cant Wait!~,I found this set and it matched the cake topper i had purchased else where months ago! Im getting married on 7-9-2010 and i cant wait to use them! They seem durable and they are absolutly beautiful!
1,Rip Off,I misread what I was going to receive. $6.+ for a one page document that by itself wasn't worth it. Save your money.
4,auto watch,"Beautiful, classic, stylish. Exactly as described. Looks a little small on my wrist. Excellent value for the price. Was disappointed, however, that this watch came in a tin can. Was under the impression that Signature Series watches from Fossil came in a nice presentation box..."
5,SIZE,"WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE PUT THE SIZE OF THIS JOURNAL ON THE TITLE PAGE. SOME JOURNALS ARE TOO SMALL FOR PICTURES, FABRIC SWATCHES, INFORMATION, ETC. THANKS."
5,Magic Memory Carpet,"Swing creates a 'Magic Memory Carpet' that floats the viewer/listener back to a time of joyful, energetic music that featured some of the best popular musicians America has produced.Actual performances, with many close-ups of featured artists like Count Basie, Stan Kenton, Buddy Rich, the Sky Larks (performing some creative arrangements of 'Swing Low Sweet Chariot' and 'The Darktown Strutters' Ball' that are timeless), make this video exciting viewing and listening. I dare you to try to sit still while it's on!The variety of selections and artists guarantees you'll find something to stir your particular happy memories. Film quality and sound is good.As a jumpstart for family gatherings, when it's great fun to dance 'our way' with children and grandchildren, this set of videos is a jewel."
5,Perfect,Despite the reviews I order my watch. Works as advertised. The coolest feature is the ability to turn the display on and off. This way you have it when you need but you're not wearing down the second battery.
3,"Nice looking watch, Hands stopped moving","I really like the looks and feel of this watch. Unfortunately, after 1 yr and 9 months the hands have stopped moving. They never realy synced up with the digital time and quickly fell behind. Everything else is in peferct condition, wrist band, crystal, etc."
1,Never worked!,"Unfortunately, the analog did not work on the watch and it is going to be returned. Very disappointing as it was a Christmas present and I now have to go through the trouble of mailing it back."
1,Worked well for a couple of months...,"I loved this watch when I first got it. Then I noticed that the analog hands did not keep time well. In less than a year, they stopped working completely. I finally tried replacing the batteries at the advice of a friend who has the same watch with the same problem, but that has not corrected the problem and what's worse is that now I cannot get the back of the watch snapped back on (even after taking to a jeweler with a special press for just this purpose!). Just in time for the warranty period to pass... Maybe you'll have better luck, but I'd try a different watch if I were you."
3,Not what it appears...,"First, this is a very nice watch, however, when I was shopping for it, the watch was listed in the Women's watches category. When I received the watch I discovered it was this gigantic watch that was totally inappropriate for a woman. When I complained to Amazon about the mischaracterization, they gave me a bunch of excuses and said they could not find it listed in the Women's watch category. That is because they quickly moved it. However, a similar watch, Timex Ironman Tri T56371 is still found in the Women's watches category. The only difference in the two is a different band and face color.Bottom line. Very nice watch, but don't let the category it is listed in mislead you as to the size of the watch."
2,"Too Heavy, display not like picture","I owned this watch for 3 yearsthe display is not green like the picture, but black and white. Check other pictures on the net.It is way too heavy. It weights as much as 3 other watches I have together. I am sure you could use it as self defense weapon. Now that the 2 batteries are dead (yes there are 2 batteries inside), I'll try to sell it for scrap metal :-)Yes, this is actually TWO Watches, there is no synch between the digital and the analog (not like casios for exemple where the analog is controlled thru push buttons)WAY Too heavy, heavier than my mobile phone.Does not look that great this big bulky plain steel frame with a useless crown, and black and white display.The back is very difficult to open if you want to service it yourself"
3,Directions to use the watch,The watch is nice but the directions to set the watch are not easy to understand.
4,Nice solid sporty and classy watch,"First of all, it needs to be emphasized that this watch runs on two batteries, one for digital display and another for analog hands. If the analog hands stop working all you need to do is to replace the battery and I would replace both at the same time since the band and cover take some effort to remove.This is my favorite Timex watch so far. It combines sporty and classy design and is solidly built with the exception of the wrist band. The watch itself has held up well for the last 2 to 3 years unlike other Timex watches that I've owned. The wrist band, on the other hand, is falling apart."
1,Thanks for nothing.,I recieved the watch within one business day of ordering which was nice. The analog on the watch however did not work at all. The watch face itself is also a lot darker than in the picture (hard to see numbers). I am very disappointed and am returning it immediately for a refund.
3,"Cool watch, poor craftsmanship.","Great design, nice features, the on/off feature for the digital display is great. HOWEVER, I had this watch for two months and buttons began mysteriously falling off. Maybe I got a lemon, but the buttons should be designed to stay on the timepiece."
5,Keeps on ticking,I purchased this watch for my boyfriend. He works in a rough environment and the watch handles it great. The features and functions are easy to understand and use. He loves it.
1,Doesn't Necessarily Take a Lickin' and Keeps on Ticking,"I have owned two of these watches and the analog hands each time either stopped working or became stuck after just over a year of ownership, meaning the guarentee no longer applies. The digital element continues to work just fine which is the first indication of the problem when the analog clock first starts to slow down and then stop. Great looking watch but poor durability. If you purchase the watch, purchase the Timex 5 year warranty extension."
4,Nice dress/work watch,"This watch is a beautiful blend of functional work watch (seems sturdy enough so far) and an attractive dress watch. Price is very reasonable and seems well made. On the downside, the indiglo could be a bit brighter and the alarm isn't very loud. All in all, a pretty nice watch for the price."
4,Takes a licking keeps on ticking?,"I looked all over the place for this watch! Stores around town did'nt have a very good selection of Timex and they even had trouble trying to order it for me. I started to get upset then went ""Amazon on it"". I have had it for a month now and both analog and digital seamed to stay true. I love the look of it most of all."
4,great watch & great deal,"I have had this watch for 3 months now. No, the digital display is not as bright as the photo, but it's plenty bright for my 38 year old eyes. For the most part, I use the analog part for checking the time anyway.My only complaint: the alarm is weak. Don't depend on it to wake you up if you're a heavy sleeper.Otherwise, I swim, run, bike, work with it, and it's reliable and looks great."
4,"good performance, day and night wearability","have owned this for a few years, has pluses and minuses:+ comfortable and accurate+ built tough. have banged this into rocks while hiking, and dropped it many times and its just fine. only one scratch on the glass.+ some of the basic functionality like stopwatch/timer, laps, etc+ best part is the digital display can be turned off, allowing the watch to be worn out at night and still look semi-classy like a non-sports watch. i've received quite a few surprise compliments on this watch from strangers while out and about (in critical nyc). people really seemed oddly impressed by the digital/analog combo.- a bit heavy for a sports watch- after a couple years, the rubber watch-band just broke from daily taking on and off."
2,"Good watch, but needed to be returned","This watch would be really good - if only it could keep time!The watch looks good, feels good and does its job well, except the analogue hands do not keep time.As other reviews here have mentioned the analogue hands do not appear to keep time, I also found the analogue-hand-adjustment knob very touchy (and possibly defective).At first I was content to reset the analogue time each time I noticed it was wrong, but when I had to do it 4 or 5 times a day, it was time to return the watch and find something that actually works, which is a shame because other than the faulty time-keeping I really liked it."
2,Great watch . . .while it worked.,"I loved this watch. It's looks made it perfect for nearly every occasion from sports to casual dining. I loved the combination and design of the analog and digital readouts. I was even able to take it for swimming in the ocean. Then, about a year or so after purchasing this watch and integrating it into my daily routines and adventures, the analog timepiece simply quit working. An new battery failed to resolve the problem. I checked on the reviews of this watch on Amazon and noticed similar complaints. Okay. Instead of repairing this watch, it was clear that there is a quality issue. This is supposed to be an ""Ironman"" watch? Not so. Sorry, but this watch led me to spend a little bit more and become a Casio customer."
2,Looks are not everything,"I have had my watch 8 months now. While it looks great and I have gotten several compliments, I have had to replace the batteries 3 times. The 1st one that it came with lasted only a month or so.It says ""Water resistant to 100 meters"". I can not even shower wearing it. If I am wearing a watch for looks, I will put it on, but if I am wearing a watch for the gym or anything else, I am putting on a different one.I do like the dual displays, but like another review says, the times on it do not always stay in sync, they slowly drift.My digital display comes and goes. And it has 2 batteries that have to be checked.I like this watch because of the looks but ended up buying another kind for everyday use and reliability."
1,Missing a disc,"The instruction that Gene Simco gives is very good, but this product is not what is advertised. I too am missing DVD 1. The cover shows moves being done on DVD 1, and it isn't even included! The remaining 90 minutes on DVD 2 is excellent."
1,Missing disc,I ordered this video and the first time it shipped it was missing disc one of the two dvd set. I sent it back and they shipped it again. Guess what....missing disc one again. Very frustrating. Cancelled my order altogether and sent it back.
4,Nice DVD,"I am new to BJJ...so I was looking for a cheap DVD (I can't buy anything too expensive or my wife will start to rag and I will eventually end up throwing her down a flight of stairs - I bought a house with a set of stairs solely for this reason.) that would give you the basics of the sport...I thought the dvd gave me a good, simple overview into BJJ..."
3,Good but wheres disc 1?,"Very informative and well done, but it seems like a two disc movie and i have only disc 2. The package is misleading it seems that two discs are included. I would like to find disc 1. Still worth the buy."
5,Great Stuff,Gene is special!! I'm a new Jiu-Jitsu Practitioner and have looked at Books and DVD's extesively to supplement my training including stuff from Wally Jay.I find this DVD very true to life inclding the breakfalls (which I had a few issues with initially).I still look at other stuff now but always go back to Gene to smooth out any rough edges.The Guy (and his team) have done a masterful job.I'm hooked.
3,Don't analyse it too much,"I read AIC at school this year, as well as seeing it on stage. I found it good when I first read it, but having to analyse everything really changed my opinion. I agree with the message behind it, but it's not the kind of script/book/play you come back to again and again."
5,The book has a message that's important for us to understand,"I've read it at school with all the rest of the children. We read it aloud and everyone exposed his opinions.I loved the message the author wanted to give us within this book, it's very important that when we are reading we must try to understand the mood in the room, everyone's position and how the inspector's way of inquiring changes the family relationship... Take in account the time it is written in, the social thionking (the division of classes, etc.) and first of all, imagine all the story and the people acting this script."
4,GCSE study,"goodness! having just written up my essay on an inspector calls, i have found these reviews! a little late, but better late than never. the review pages are fab, thanx amazon. an inspector calls is set in the industrial revolution about a family who all, without knowing it, participate to a young girl's death. but there are lots of twists and turns to be exposed! enjoy it xmelx"
5,Great journey!,"This book takes you along for the ride. The author does an amazing job of drawing you into the story so you feel like you're in first person, instead of third. Let's have a sequel!The Talisman of Faerie"
3,"Easier to lift than Infinite Jest, but harder to like.","I would have adored this book, except for two things. One is the character of Rick Vigorous, and the second is every scene in which he appears. To misquote and mangle Will Rogers, I have metafiction I didn't like! You can see the genius that would produce Infinite Jest in certain scenes and especially in the minor (unfortunately) character of Stonecipher LaVache Beadsman. He's quite good. The book has other glimmers of joy in it, no doubt, but all in all I just didn't want to read it very much. What can you do to suspend your disbelief when you have characters named Judith Prietht and Candy Mandible?"
3,Extremely funny if bloated and unfinihsed.,"I've never read any of Wallace's fiction before, and this thing is just crazy. It's got this really playful, almost freewheeling sensibility that is grounded by these long but agonizingly precise sentences, especially with the dialogue. It feels kind of like Donald Barthelme on crack. And my god, is it funny. Only A Confederacy of Dunces has ever made me laugh this hard while reading. I wasn't sure what to make with all of the little philosophical flourishes, at times they seem sincere, at times, almost tongue-in-cheek. The narrative sort of looses steam in the last hundred pages as things begin to resolve themselves in ways that are either dully predictable or (In my mind) wholly inscrutable. Though I think I can forgive its flaws since he wrote it when he was in his early 20's. A fact that only baffled (and quite often, intimidated) me the farther I got into it. Maybe if I read Wittgenstein it will all become clear..."
2,I love DFW and hate I'm giving this 2 stars....,"...but I wanted to hear DFW read it such as his ""Consider the Lobster"" essay cd and ""Brief Interviews"" cd. This has another voice that inexplicably grates my nerves. Sorry to be a party pooper, the narration is the thing that scored low for me on this item. Otherwise, it was 5 stars."
1,snoozarama,Story includes several humorous Woody Allenesque anecdotal moments of fantasy butone-dimensional characters make the book a weary project to read.
2,This book was terrible enough for me to write a review on it.,"The Broom of the System left me sad, angry, and a little more than confused. Any book capable of drawing such strong emotions in me is worth more than one star, which is why I gave it two. Beautiful writing and language that leads from nothing to nowhere in a somewhat hefty 467 pages.They cheat and lie in too many ways and are all products of misunderstanding.This entire book is a big misunderstanding, I highly recommend against it."
1,Mildy humorous; totally pretentious,"I made it about a quarter of the way through this book and finally answered the question I had been asking from the first page, the same question I ask at the start of any book, ""what's the point of reading this?"" and the answer was ""There is no point to going any further because there is no point."" The book is a stream of consciousness hodgepodge of loosely plotted ramblings about people in some darkened Ohio town. While I found myself chuckling once or twice, it was not nearly enough to outweigh the fact that this ""literature"" is a complete waste of anyone's time. Author's companion novel, Infinite Jest, lies here in a pile waiting to be donated to the library to save others from wasting their money."
