4,These two deserve recognition!!,"As far as I know, not one person that I have mentioned 'Anomos' or 'Stealth' to, has even heard of them - however those who I have allowed to hear the rhymes of these talented wordsmiths; have nodded and grinned in excitement. Not the most incredible album in my collection but fans of the un-jiggy/wordplay vibe will like this!! Sits somewhere between Solesides Greatest Bumps, The Underground Tapes Vol.1 and Passage Through Time - Da Grassroots. I can only hope my debut EP sounds as good as this. Please buy it, I know it will fulfill your craving for something fresh and undiscovered other than the doughnut behind the couch!!"
2,Not a book many women would enjoy....,"I had high hopes for this book, but the more I read it the less I liked it. The characters were just dopey, and not very likeable. The male protagonist was self-absorbed and shallow that he treated the women in his life in a shoddy way. I just couldn't get attached to anyone in the book, or care about what happened. I would't recommend it."
4,"Great story, great reading","This book was thoroughly enjoyable for me. It was a real story, about real people, struggling with real life issues. Laf, the voice and main charactor, is a writer with the hopes of being acclaimed. His wife Martha, a religious woman, throws him out because of his affair with Judi, a psychologist. He struggles throughout the book with his feelings of love, lust, faith, and relationships but when Judi becomes ill with cancer, he learns just a little more about them all. I recommend it!"
3,My feelings about this book were mixed.,"When he sticks to the heart of his touching story about death, caretakers, and searching for love, Dufresne's book is powerful. Unfortunately, his ""story within a story"" about Laf's unpublished novella concerning Dale and Theresa is boring and adds nothing to the book; I kept wishing he'd just get back to the main story line. The best parts of this up-and-down novel are the insights into the pain and suffering a cancer patient must endure; Defresne handles the age-old dilemma of whether the ""cure"" is worse than the disease itself with unusual insight and compassion.It's a shame that he marred this insightful story with his ramblings about Laf's unpublished (and rightfully so) works-in-progress."
3,"Interesting writing, but too many issues are left unresolved","John Dufresne writes with many different techniques. Some got a bit tiresome, but others were fresh and kept you reading. I think that males would enjoy this more than females, because Dufresne writes in a way that males might be able to connect with better."
4,Very Detailed !!! I LOVE Johnny Depp !!!,"This book was great ! I learned a lot about Johnny and the people he has worked with over the years. But if you want a book ONLY on Johnny, this book might not be for you. This book will also teach you a little about Marlon Brando, Joe Pistone (Donnie Brasco), and Hunter S. Thompson. This book tells you EVERTHING you could ever possibly know about almost every one of Johnny's movies and himself. It is goes very in depth !!!"
2,Not as good as the Whose House Shape Sorter,"I purchased this toy as a gift thinking it was similar to the ""Whose House"" shape sorter my daughter has. The picture shows that it has the same handle and includes the plastic toys also found in the Whose House sorter. However, when the product arrive the handle is a plain yellow rope and all the shapes inside are cloth and pretty cheaply made. The Whose House product is a much better toy and worth the difference in price.Whose House Shape Sorter"
5,Adorable!,"This is one of the most adorable infant toys I have seen! And the price is awesome...a steal if you get it on sale! It is soft and brightly colored! I bought one for my granddaughter and then ordered another as a baby shower gift! Because of the bright colors, you could use this from about two weeks old!"
5,All the bad things,I'd like to comment on how rich and wonderful this cd is. it covers all of the aspects of a relationship. I like the smooth melodies presented in the song All the bad things. I feel jokari will be an artist that will last a long time in the music industry
3,FAIR,"I THINK THE SINGLE IS FAIR, I FEEL HE CAN BE MORE VOCAL IN CERTAIN AREAS... BUT THE KID IS MAD TALENTED, HIS VOICE IS MAD ORIGINAL......I CAN'T FRONT ON THAT..!"
3,get a new package,"Berries are find, but the package is bad. Unable to open neatly and then it rips open and your berries are all over the floor."
5,Love Pyrex!!,"This is a nice pie plate. Anything I've ever bought from Pyrex has been great quality, and I'm very satisfied with the pie plate."
4,Nice pics,"Nice black and white pics from old Kuwait, most of them I saw for the first time. Good for those who are travelling to Kuwait, the change is striking."
4,Thesis,"Nichols has basically written the equivalent of a term paper on the films and life of Woody Allen. That is not to say that the book is dull or only a collection of non-emotive facts about Allen. It delves deep to examine the many facets of his life and the films that he has created. For anyone who really appreciates Woody Allen's films, this would be the book for you."
2,"Hmmm, well...","""Midnight Warrior"" is the kind of book that you read for the sex, because you would be sadly disappointed if you actually read it for the historical accuracy or the ""romance"". Iris Johansen is a master at depicting heroines who, having come from less than dazzling backgrounds, find inner strength. Amazingly, even at their angriest, these women never swear, which is more than can be said for the ""heroes"". A more bull-headed lot of males I have never read about--! Oh, well, perhaps I am being unfair because I am not a Johansen fan...but, the only way for you to find out is to read a Johansen book for yourself"
4,This story is so DIFFERENT!!,As always Iris Johansen comes up with a fascinating and different story line. She has such a great imagination. I love the added character that is always so mysterious and interesting. As in Lord's Bride she has another great character in this one. Keep up the great story lines. I am just starting The Beloved Scoundrel and can't wait to see if she does it again.
3,Certainly not one of Johansen's best,"I've read countless novels by Johansen, from all the different genres she writes in, and Midnight Warrior wasn't her best. While the sex scenes did not disappoint (and come on, we all know that's what we look for in a romance novel!), the relationship between Brynn and Gage didn't feel like the head-over-heels romance that it could have been. I also thought that Brynn's unconditional love for Gwynthal, where she was born, was a tad unrealistic.The slight twist Johansen added in at the very end was a bit over the top, and took more away from the story than it added to it.This book was good to pass the time between other novels, but there are better romance novels out there. I'd like to give it 2.5 stars, but because you can't, I guess 3 will have to do.For Johansen at her best, I strongly suggest the Wind Dancer trilogy."
4,May my man be like Gage,"Midnight Warrior is my second book from Iris Johansen after The Magnificent Rouge. I must say that I enjoy the plot of the Magnificent Rouge better. Somehow in comparison, the plot twists in this book were less surprising. The supporting characters are weaker compared to those in Magnificent Rouge. Nevertheless, I like the Gage and Brynn. I wish I have such a protector and lover like Gage, as steadfast as a tower, he promised and delivered, he is very possessive in a very exciting way. I find Brynn's stubbornness a bit tormenting not only for Gage, but for herself and the reader. I wish she was more expressive and spontaneous in her feelings."
3,got annoying,I found some of this book rather amusing. But the heroin became extremely annoying to the point i was ready to stop reading the book all together. Once you get past the annoying personality of the heroin the story line is very clever and refreshing. The secondary characters made it worth the time i spent reading this book our hero's friend was very amusing and made me laugh a couple of times.
1,went bad after less than 3 months,I bought this 100 foot white roll. tested it before I installed it. never overwrapped it over itself. insulated my lines with this and wrapped it with 80 $ in fiberglass with vapor barrier from the same brand. water lines froze today. hooked my Kill-A-Watt meter up to it it is drawing 1 watt. to take all that insulation off(took 6 man hours to put it on in a tiny tiny crawl space) would cost more than to just leave it and let the water in the faucet drip. i will just let it drip.. at least it got me under the house to wrap the damn lines but i think its a bunch of crap that it failed before the first big freeze. it has a freking 2 year warranty but what good is that when it costs over 100 dollars in your time alone just to unwrap everything?????
5,Just what we needed,This was just what we needed and easy to install. We probbably oreder more later.
4,good value,I purchased this to have some reference for DIY jobs on my van. It arrived promptly and was as described in used but good condition.
4,A necessity for anyone who owns one of these vehicles!,"This book represents the best money you could spend on your vehicle. Maintenance schedules as well as explicit photos of major (and minor) repairs/maintenance. Buy it, use it, love it.For the record, I own a 1995 Chevy G10."
3,diy car mechanic,"The Haynes manuals are always good.I did not get what I was looking for as I have a 2000 GMCVan, so it did not help me in my search for a solution to my problem."
5,The best!,"I love every track on this tape! Especially 'God Loves Texas' - I would buy it for that one alone, but every track is excellent! Great for listening, dancing, toe tapping, driving, or just to feel good. Add this one to yourcollection for sure."
2,Wanted to love it,"We are a homeschooling family and I was so excited to see this series of books in our curriculum this year. This particular one was recommended first and we got halfway through chapter 7. At that point, I just couldn't put my children - or myself - through the suffering anymore. While it is very accurate factually, the writing was just plain dull and boring to us. The first chapter gave us great hope, but then it went quickly downhill from there. No offense to the authors, and I do believe the other books will get better (from researching on my curriculum's message board - many people felt this particular book was very boring). We will continue on and hope that the others are better. As for this one, it goes back on the shelf."
1,JUNK!,"I had been wanting this camera for a while, since my boss showed it to me online. The things I saw online made it look so cool. I'm a camera buff. Finally decided to order it, I even paid extra for next day shipping. I was excited to get home to try it out. As soon as I opened the package and picked it up, I realized how cheaply made it is. I loaded the film according to the directions, but the advance mechanism didn't work right. It would just tear the film at the little gripper hole things. I thought maybe it was my error or defective film or something. I went out and bought another 2 rolls of film to try. Same thing! The advance wheel feels so cheap and notchy. The design of the advance wheel is terrible also. It doesn't grip the film positively. I packaged the camera back up, and now am returning it. I guess I have to eat the extra shipping costs and cost of the film I bought to try it the second time. What a waste of money! Don't buy this!!! :( Look for a quality camera."
1,cheap,"This sorry cheap excuse for a toy camera broke before I could even get one picture developed. Plus, this is not a real Lomo. Fake, low-quality and lame."
1,grrr,"The colored flashes seemed like a fun idea, but I broke this camera within 10 minutes of removing it from its excessive packaging. I was trying to change the color filters, and the cap on the color wheel wouldn't stay on when I tried to replace it. And then the flash charge button broke and I gave up. Try the Lomographic Compact Automat 35MM instead. Holgas are fun too."
4,"Man, is analog the new cool?","OK, so the design really caught my eye. I couldn't wait till I could get my hands on my new 35mm film camera, that's right, film. Not digital. And when it came, it was all about presentation. Sadly, I haven't gotten the trademark Lomographic pictures that I wanted, partly because the flash didn't work at all on my first of now three rolls. Works with normal 35mm - I recommend 400 speed. Man, maybe it's too early to review this product, as it might be time as the main factor. The truths: The craftmanship is sub-par, but concept is crucial to liking and/or buying this camera for you or someone you love. It is an experiment waiting to begin! Have fun."
4,Colorsplash,"The camera takes cool pictures and is fun to mess around with but it's just a little cheap. I think that they should take more time to make a better quality camera, not one that you are scared to touch for fear of it breaking. All that aside, again this camera does take fun pictures that turn out well."
1,An Expensive Piece of Defective Plastic,The camera package seemed to have opened before when it came. Plus the camera itself is dirty and doesn't look brand new. The camera is indeed a piece of junk plastic as some other users said. Colorsplash is a fun camera to play with and it produces artistic. But only buy it if you have too much money to waste. Consider buying a Holga if you want a better and cheaper lomo and don't mind shooting 120.
2,I don't reccomend this item.,Cheaply made. The rewind knob broke the first time using it. I had to rewind the film by dark room. Definately not worth its price. You could get the same effect with any other camera covering the flash with a clear colored plastic.
1,"DON""T BUY IT!!!","Don't buy it. The camera is cheaply made- mine broke in about a week. It had trouble rewinding the film and the colored flash re-loader thingy broke as well. I'm going to buy a Holga instead and hopefully that will work out better. Trust me, this camera looks fun and easy to use but don't waste your money."
1,"Cheap Camera, not easy to use","My camera stopped working after a week and a half. I had to send it back for a refund which I was glad to receive...IT's difficult to use and poorly made.=( too bad, nice idea...but just poorly constructed, won't last long!"
1,DON'T BUY,"If I could give this camera 0 stars I would, it stinks. My story on this camera is a way too long one to explain. All I have to say is that I am very mad that I wasted (...)on a piece of crap. If you listen to me you will be better off!"
2,"good quality of shoe,but hurt the top part of your foot.",Good overall shoe but the top part is that hard plastic fell that really starts to hurt only after a few minutes of wearing them. I am returng my pair because it wore blisters on the top of my foot for only having them on for 10 minutes.
1,Blisters Blisters Blisters Blisters,"I was very happy with the look when I pulled them out of the box. The first time that I put them on, I walked my dog around the block. When I got home I pulled them off, and to my surprise, I had blisters on the inside and outside of both feet. I had thought that since they were made of rubber, that they would be perfect for the beach. Not so! The sand only added to the abrasion on my feet."
3,"Brief review of ""Dear People...Robert Shaw""","This book is welcome principally because it is the only systematic discussion of the life (or a good portion thereof) of one of the important musical figures in the second half of the 20th century. Unfortunately the author fails to capture the essence of what made Robert Shaw successful as a performer and how his inspiration largely fueled the ""choral renaissance"" in this country. The definitive critical biography of this singular talent remains to be written."
5,a classic for good reason,I got this toy because it contains so many opportunities for sensory learning. Each segment is a different bright color and makes a different sound (activated when you or your child squeezes or shakes it -- no dumbed down just push a button here) and it feels soft (made of velour). I got it when my daughter was 3 months old but I would say she didn't really fall in love with it until about five months. A great value.
4,Great but don't know where Crinkle comes from,"We received this product and our little one really likes all the colors and the squeaking noise but I'm not sure where the ""crinkle"" part comes from because our product must be defective. There isn't any crinkle but we can live without."
5,Best sleeping toy,I received one as a hand-me down and ordered a second one just for day care. This is the best sleeping toy - my son just cuddles it up in his arms!
3,Sqeaker is hard to engage,"My daughter thinks this toy is cute, but the squeaking mechanism is difficult to engage. I have to squeeze it for her to get it to squeak, which limits the fun she can have with it."
5,Excellent toy,"I actually bought this toy for my 3 month old puppy (as he was bored of most dog toys). He is now four months and this is still his favorite toy. Needless to say this attests to the toy's durability (for babies). Great how its washable, too."
4,My boys find this toy to be cute,I'd really give this toy 3-1/2 stars.I got this toy for my twins' first Christmas in 2005. They were 4 months old. They didn't go out of their way to play with it but they love when I hold it up and make the toy squeak and shake it. At almost 15 months they still love the noise it makes.One of my boys sometimes carries it around and chews on it and the toy has held up well. They are also in a throwing phase and I'd rather have them throw this soft toy then something hard.
4,hot and noisy,Works as advertised. Vent is 4 sones (loud) and the heater is even louder. The heater is much too big for a small (5X8) bathroom unless you don't have central heat.
3,Fan works well,"The fan works well to ventilate (noisy but tolerable), but the heater is so noisy that we don't use it."
1,"Horrible, unsafe and cheaply made","I had this unit installed by a professional. Not only was the bag of screws missing from the box, that was bad enough but luckily I was able to use hardware from my existing unit I was replacing...but once we got this up and running within 10 seconds the plastic grill started to melt and warp. In 30 seconds it was smoking and we had to kill the power and circuit breaker. After we turned the power back on the unit wouldn't start up again. Thats right, in less than a minute the unit was toast.Even if this fan is defective I would not recommend buying this for a few reasons:1) the grill is cheap plastic, and melted extremely quickly2) the fan is made of plastic - don't think it would fare well either with longer usage3) The heating element is right where the wiring is...and the wiring is not long enough to be routed elsewhere"
3,Broan 658,"I had received the item in a timely fashion and was happy with how smooth the transaction was. I can't blame Amazon or it's immediate Vendor for this, but when I had received the product, it was missing an important item. I must go to the Manufacturer to order the replacement piece. It's not that expensive, but it has delayed me being able to install the product."
2,The Book is at best OK,"The book has a LITTLE good information. The largest problem it has is that it ALWAYS refers back to the first volume. If you don't have the first, which is hard to find at times, its pretty much useless to read."
1,Unfriendly,"I found this book very difficult to follow. He is trying to answer too many questions in one book and the information becomes very confusing instead of sticking with the basics.May consider writing several books and breaking them down to the different levels instead of trying to cram it all in one do it all book.Horses are like people they come in all different sizes, shapes, and intelligence. The book you need for guidance needs to be as such to fit the horse's needs, so you can train them properly."
5,My Favorite,This is my favorite CD of Dwight's. I love every song on this CD. My favorite song on this CD is A Thousand Miles From Nowhere. This is country music at its best. I love the video also because it has trains in an old train yard and I love trains. Fast As You is also a good song. I love the beat of the song and it is a good song to country line dance to. Ain't that Lonely Yet is also a very good song with a relaxing melody. This Time is a very good song and it is pure country music at its best. It reminds me of Buck Owens singing in the 60's. My least favorite song on the CD is Pocket Of A Clown. All in all this CD is the finest work Dwight has ever done.
5,Sexy haunting voice of the best in country!,"Only one compares to Dwight and that is Alan Jackson. This CD is his best, every song sung with full rich meaning and his ever twangy sexy voice. Through those music videos, I came to know this wonderful performer who deserves more that he received! Every song on this CD is great, just pure country listening at its best!"
5,"""This Time, "" YEAH!!!","I'm not even going to belabor the point that Dwight and George Jones possess the finest two male voices in Country Music. (Sorry all you misguided ""garth"" fans). You KNOW that when you hear music by either of these two men, you can legitimately say, ""Yeah, it just don't get ANY better than this."" But as a die-hard rock and roller for the last 40 years, please allow me to introduce Dwight's rock and roll legitimacy: Listen to ""Wild Ride,"" and you'll hear the kind of rock and roll that even the Rolling Stones haven't been able to produce since 1972. Pete Anderson, Dwight's guitarist, is, as far as I'm concerned, FAR more...interesting to listen than Slowhand, and, bless Pete's and Dwight's heart's, THEY'VE never drug in ""Babyface"" to produce their stuff so that ""it would be more accessible to the masses."" Keep up the good work, guys!"
5,My favourite Dwight cd,"This is truly an exceptional album...I think it is the best one that Dwight has put out. Every song is brilliant, and it doesn't matter if you are a country fan or not. This album just about appeals to fans of all type of music. He wrote or co-wrote all but one song on here, which proves that he is also a great songwriter as well as singer/musician. This album has it all, from ballads, country rockers to honky tonkers. The booklet includes all lyrics and a few photos. If anyone out there ""poo-poos"" country music, then I urge you to give this a try. it may just change your mind. Recommended."
1,Well ...,"No longer in print, published by a 19-year-old kid through a free program that Barnes & Noble was running for its employees at the time. Pseudofeminist and quite silly. So ... that really was an upside-down chicken riding a broomstick on the cover, wasn't it?"
4,A history of the Beech Aircraft Corporation; 1932 - 1975,A history of the Beech Aircraft Corporation from its inception in 1932 through 1975. Describes its achievements and product line through that time. Also highlights the key personnel and their achievements. The book contains a good number of photographs and moderate detail about each of the company's projects.
5,I love these pipes,"Gibson bagpipes are among the finest made. The drone tone is excellent. It's nice and warm, but at the same time has good penetration. The harmonics are second to none. The drones are easy to tune, and accept a wide variety of reeds. I've had the best luck using Kinnaird, Ross Omega, and Smartdrones in these pipes. The chanter is bright and crisp sounding, though the poly band chanter is a touch too high pitched for my taste...I much prefer the solo blackwood chanter, as it is pitched slightly lower. Still, if you want good quality African Blackwood pipes that will last longer than you will, and have great tone, Gibson is definitely a pipemaker to consider."
2,Some good info but a lot of wasted time,"This review is based on another DVD by Jim Wagner. I won't purchase his other DVD's for the reasons stated below. I'm sure he is an awesome practitioner of the arts, but he doesn't understand instructional production.I can't help but think as an instructor Jim didn't consider the limited amount of time he had to convey a lot of knowledge. A lot of time was wasted on introducing many assistants and information about where they were from and their background; who cares? It wouldn't be as bad if he didn't use so many different people, but I got the impression he was trying to give everyone he knew their 15 seconds of fame.Bottom line: This video could have been edited down to about 15 minutes of good information."
4,good bang for the buck,"surprisingly decent setup and can't beat the price.cameras have gotten dropped a few times (i've not yet mounted them/fished wire) and still work fine.poor detail at distances over about 30 feet, but quite decent closer up.comes with everything you need and works as advertised."
3,Not what was advertised.,"I purchased this item purely for observing my backyard at night (lots of nocturnal wildlife in my area). Even though stated on the packaging and Amazons webpage, this item DID NOT have LED lights that provided some illumination making it useless for my purposes. Also we found that the slightest touch to the wire or a stiff breeze caused the image to cut out periodically. The image was pretty good during the daylight hours and we had no complaints about the sound level. If i had intended this item for use close to my house where i have adaquate lighting i may have kept it."
1,Cameras are too big,"I returned it because the cameras are too big. There is another Swann DIY that comes with 4 real small, color & audio cameras. It also comes w/ the monitor."
5,More please!,At first I couldn't believe how many there were in this series but now I am so relieved because my girls literally cannot get enough! They barely have come up for air since receiving these for Christmas. Great stuff!!Enjoying the Ride
2,is it for a man or women?,I think they should have more info on this product my boyfriend is taking this and I'm am not sure if it safe it has alot of iron to be for a man way more then my woman vitamins which is making up for lost iron during menstration I know too much iron can be dangerous and I don't want to see him cause more harm than good.. any info would be very helpful
1,This book ruined me!,"I agree with what Kalamazoo had to say, I have BOTH the Haynes book and the Chilton book. Compared to Haynes, Chilton isn't fit to tear apart and start the kindling with. Chilton is completely worthless as far as containing useful or accurate information or diagrams. I learned more from the owner's manual and underhood diagrams (which are pitiful in the Neon, BTW) than from the Chilton book. Believe me, that is the LAST time I'll ever be suckered into wasting my money on ANYTHIng by Chilton. I honestly don't know how they can stay in business with the dreck they pawn off on the public...Maybe they won't.."
1,HOW COULD YOU GIVE THIS BOOK 5 STARS ?,OTHER REVIEWER GAVE THIS BOOK 5 STARS. IF YOU READ THE REVIEW CAREFULLY THE BOOK WASN'T EVEN OUT YET WHEN THE REVIEW WAS WRITTEN. WELL I SAW THE BOOK AND IT STINKS. TYPICAL VAGUE DO-IT-YOURSELF TIRE CHANGING BOOK. SAVE YOUR MONEY. BUY A HAYNES BOOK. THEY REALLY TAKE THE CAR APART. ALL CHILTON DOES IS TAKE THE BOOK OUT OF THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT AND FLUFF IT UP.
5,Great Bush interview!,"Always a fan of George Bush, but this DVD was put together professionally and was worth the watch. Great perspective from the man in the top decision seat at one of our worst times. Shows what he was thinking and what he dealt with during this crisis and what guided his decision to go after the Taliban and Al Queda to enact justice."
4,HP Rules,"I have an HP printer, HP Scanner, and this HP CDRW. None of the HP products has disappointed me. This CDWR comes with a big installation guide. So setting it up should be just a breeze. Also, recording a whole audio cd takes no more than 10 mins. A must for all music lover. Reason for 4 stars out of 5, the price is a little high. But if you want new high tech toys, you got to pay the price!!!"
5,"Great performance, very reliable!","Well, I got this for Christmas, and I must say it's wonderful. Installation was easy, it took me about 45 minutes total with software and all. It comes with a CD that you can put into your existing CD-ROM drive before you install the CD-Writer that has a complete video that actually shows you step by step on how to install it. All you have to do is follow the instructions in the video and it works fine. As far as performance, it converted 19 mp3's to wave files and burned them to a CD-R it a little over 7 minutes. Wonderful product by HP!"
4,A great deal!,"Thoroughly pleased with this purchase as it has all the sections you'd expect & is a hardcover as well. The quality binding is strong as is the paper. I glued-on my own ribbon page markers as these were lacking, but that was my only complaint, but for the price, it was a small effort on my part."
5,"Thanks, great concordance!",Can't wait to start using this! It will help me immensely in my studying.
4,My personal product rating....,"This book has everything and anything that you would want to find in the Bible. The only thing I didn't like about it is that it is very heavy and big, which makes it hard to handle"
2,New Strong's Exhautive Concordance (Super Value Series),"Vendor was emailed (and replied) regarding a problem with the above book - over two weeks ago. I have not heard from them since about correcting the problem although they said they will work on it. I hesitate to order from them again due to apparently poor customer service. I don't know what caused the delay, but they could have contacted me and let me know."
5,Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of Bible review,This book is very very detailed and would buy from this author again and would highly recommend it to others.
3,A good place to begin,"This concordance is a good starting place if you're using a King James tranlsation of the Bible. If you have another translation, you may be frustrated as you try to guess the applicable synonym. Strong gives you the basics of the word. Just the basic definition, original Greek or Hebrew spelling, English transliteration, and synonyms from Scripture. Sometimes it's interesting to follow the roots of the word and explore its variations. But if you're looking for in-depth information about a particular word, you're not going to find it here."
5,Great Bible study guide,A great Bible study guide to help you in your search for The Lord Jesus Christ during your Strait Gate and Narrow Way walk.
4,The Strong's Expanded Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible,"I love this book but it is very large and difficult to take with me when traveling. Would love to see this in e-book form for studying via the web on tablets, smart phones, computers...."
4,Classic and indispensable,"Unless you read Hebrew and Greek every version of the Bible is just a translation which is very imprecise at times but with this book you can help bridge that gap. It's a classic and indispensable for doing word studies because you can see how each word is used throughout the Bible and find synonyms that sometimes make a world of difference when trying to understand a certain verse or phrase. Granted it is much faster to use an appropriate software package but if you'd like to unchain yourself from the computer (horrors!) and get mobile with your studies for a very small price, you can't do without this. -- Moza"
3,"Exhaustive, yet limited","This concordance is extremely valuable and an excellent concordance...but only for the King James Version. Every word in the KJV is listed with the sentence it is found in, accompanied with the biblical passage it is found in. I also appreciate the Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek dictionary in the back of the book, however, the definitions are all lumped together without any emphasis placed on different verbs of the lexicon itself.This is an excellent general study book for exhaustive knowledge pertaining to the King James Version, but personally, still feel that Zondervan produces the best study bible on the market, especially for laymen and students."
4,THE SOUL OF MR. INGRAM,"Ingram is one of pop/soul's premiere vocalists, his silky yet earthy voice can wrap itself around romantic ballads or funky up-tempo tunes.ALWAYS YOU focuses on his ballad side, containing only one real up-tempo track.Of course, the ballads are excellent, especially the soaring emotional LET ME LOVE YOU THIS WAY and the poignant ALWAYS YOU. A BABY'S BORN cleverly mutates from straight ahead ballad to a funky gospelish number. The album's biggest hit, SOMEONE LIKE YOU, is typical smooth Ingram.There are some minor flaws----SING FOR THE CHILDREN is one of those mawkish anthems replete with children's chorus that would better suit the Carpenters in the 70s. And a couple more songs like the funky ANY KIND OF LOVE would provide more balance and explore Ingram's diversity more fully.Overall, though, ALWAYS YOU is good soulful music. Wish Ingram would record some new music soon!"
3,Fun Time Bears,"Having seen Ahpun in action live is great. It is much more spectacular in person. You get a real feel for the size and gracefulness of the polar bear. The movie ends with a saying that they live happily ever after together. This is not true. After 5 years of being playmates they have been separated. I liked the video it is great for small children, lasting only 1/2 hour. But being the Discovery channel, and Nature freak fan that I am I felt the movie was lacking information on the history of each animal and the individual habits of these types of bears. I suggest you purchase this video to support the Alaska Zoo."
5,GREAT!,"Great photos and text from the Rosenfelds, photographers extrordinaire of the 20th century! Awesome in every way. Classic wooden boats, both large and small. Long live the Dorade!"

5,A story of Magic for our daughters,I look forward to having my daughter read this book when she reaches 10. It gives her a way to understand and celebrate the changing seasons.It also offers great ways to share in the seasonal rituals with a workbook of ideas. And the glossary is very helpful. An easy and fun read. As a mother it helps me appreciate how to bring the rituals into my family's life.
1,Had to return it because it was not 15A,I returned it because it is not 15A as it says on the site. It is only 12.something. Looks good but I am not going to risk it.
5,Wow!,"This third (and perhaps final) installment of Sir Apropos of Nothing may just be the best book out of the three. Peter David maintains his hilarious (and painful) use of puns with the names such as Itso Isi, Hamunri, and Go Nogo (and many more which I won't spoil). The plot moves along at a steady pace, and any lulls in the action are used to further character development. And the final chapters in the book are so shocking and powerful that I am led to believe that Peter David is either a genius or the sickest man alive! If you read the first two books, buy and read this book ASAP."
1,Don't Read It,"Let me be perfectly clear.I have liked every other Peter David novel I have read with the exception of One Knight Only. I couldn't get into it and gave up.I think he's a great writer.But if there's one thing I can't stand and won't abide, it's ...Okay, no spoilers...Unless you're familiar with the way Douglas Adams ended his Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy series.Or how Terry Nation ended the TV show Blake's 7.Hint, hint.If you don't like down, gritty and dissapointing endings, skip this one.I wasted my money, AND I'm bummed."
3,An ending from the land of Kopout,"For almost every page, this book delivers. Fans of the first two books will be giddy with joy, for this book has the same goofy puns, the same sardonic narration, and the same ridiculous names a the first two books. Almost every page is full of all the cynical wit that the first two Apropos books delivered. The story builds wonderfully, and then at the very end of the book there are two . . . plot twists. The first might not be as shocking as Apropos finds it, but the second is way over the top. Together, they forge a conclusion so harsh and sudden, it feels as if the author just gave up. It is as if your favorite football team is winning the Super Bowl, and then they suddenly forfeit and leave .Other readers may find the ending of ""Tong Lashing"" rather, well, apropos; but Apropos - and the reader- deserved something better."
3,A Conscience?,"I enjoyed the first two books in the series immensely for different reasons. The first book, while irreverent, dealt beautifully with the concept of an anti-hero who thinks he is a hero. The second book was just a fun romp with a small bit of soul searching thrown in. The third book in the series, Tong Lashing, lost a lot of the humor of the previous two books and seemed overburdened with an almost high-school goth girl search for meaning in life. I appreciate developing characters as much as the next libriphile (pardon my mixing of Greek and Latin), but Peter David should not have tried to turn his amoral anti-hero into a moral hero in the space of a few hundred pages. Tong Lashing, while humrous at times, will leave you a bit put-off by how much preaching David launches into. I'd still read it because I cannot not finish a series, but don't buy this book. Take a day and sit at Barnes and Noble or borrow it from a friend, but don't buy it."
2,"""Regret""-ably, the end of the line","Some bands define a decade (The Beatles in the 1960s), and some bands are defined by a decade, such as New Order was by the 1980s. By the time 1993 rolled around, New Order was like a fish out of water, and ""Republic"" regretably shows that. The album kicks off with the fine single ""Regret"" and then spins off to where no other New Order album had ever gone before--mediocrity. Nirvana and the grunge movement had changed the rock scene forever and the once cutting edge New Order no longer seemed relevant. Fortunately, they sensed this fact and made ""Republic"" their final album. Check out any of their 1980s albums instead, particularly ""Low Life"" and ""Technique."""
2,Pales in comparison to previous records,"Although New Order was uneven even before this one (Brotherhood is full of mediocre filler, and Low-Life has some bad stuff), the consistent quality of Technique created high expectations for the next record.This record didn't have even one song that I cared for, and I gave the CD away. New Order's best records, in my estimation are: Power Corruption and Lies, Movement, and Technique. All three are very different, but consistently great throughout."
3,Not great but not bloody bad either,"Ok, so it's not Technique or anything, but that's a pretty high standard to judge anything by. By and large, Republic isn't nearly as bad as New Order traditionalists like to rant.Is it worth buying? Well, let me wax Socratic: is New Order one of your favorite bands? If so, pick it up (on discount if at all possible). I absolutely adore ""Regret"" (one of N.O.'s absolute best) and ""World"". ""Ruined in a Day"" and ""Everyone Everywhere"" are pretty rad tunes in their own right, but woefully subpar if you're measuring them against the songs off of Substance, Low Life, and Technique (all must buys)."
3,A couple of great tracks on here,"Well it doesn't deliver what fans were waitng for but it still manages to keep hope and interest alive with a couple of brilliant tracks.'Regret' is simply superb, a great pop song. 'World' isn't spectacular but it does have its own charm and grows on you with every listen. While 'Special' is a hidden masterpiece. What a track, for only the second time on this album (Regret being the other one) Barney sings as if he really means it. All the traditional New Order elements are present in this song which automatically makes it great in my book!Worth buying...."
2,Leave this one alone,"I bought this album for the single ""Regret"". It remains one of their best songs ever. Up there with ""BLT"" and ""Perfect Kiss"". I kept this album for years for that song. (FYI: I do own all their albums also). But the rest of the album is lackluster and sounds like a solo effort by Bernard and eventually ended up in the used bin. If you want ""Regret"" get ""The Best of..."", if want a better album get Technique, Low Life, anything."
3,"The least ""New Order like"" album","This album doesn't sound like New Order (except ""Regret"" of course), it looks like Peter Hook was completely out of the picture on the recording process. This album would be great for any other band, but not for New Order standards. It seems that they were trying to catch on with the electronic trends of that period (mid 90's). The song ""Times Change"" sounds like a cross between Ace of Base and the Pet Shop Boys. Like I said this not a bad album specially because it contains three wonderful singles, but I think is New Order's worst (not ""Movement"", 1981).If you want to have the best of New Order, buy their first four albums and ""Substance"" (1987). If you're just a casual listener, ""the best of"" (1995)and the newest one ""Get ready"" (2001) will do."
3,Republic is a big letdown,"This is my least favorite New Order album and it may be just as well that they packed it in (at least temporarily) afterwards with the advent of Grunge music. The songs here are decent, notably ""Regret"", ""World"" and ""Runied In A Day"" but it all sounds very forced. It probably didn't help that the band members were all dabbling in solo side projects (Bernard Sumner's ""Electronic"" collaboration with Johnny Marr and Peter Hook's various musical distractions). Nonetheless this album is far from spectacular and for New Order freaks only."
5,One of the best,"New Order fans tend to hate this album. Well I am a HUGE fan, and I believe this is one of their best. ""Regret"" is one of their best song ever. True, some tracks completely outshine the others, like ""ruined in a day"". I can of feel like this is the last New Order album...""Get Ready"" is a fine record though, but it feels a little out of the pack to me."
2,The end of New Order,"""Regret"" is a great song, but after ""Regret"" the record really slides until the nadir of the second half. If you like bland ""alternative dance"" music that is neither alternative nor dance, nor interesting, this is for you. You can tell that someone has poor musical taste if they think this is New Order's best album. If you like songs like ""Young Offender"", ""Liar"", and ""Times Change"", and like techno this bland, you must not really like New Order. Sad downfall of Factory records and New Order."
3,Going Through the Motions.,"This is actually an okay CD, but from a group that 1) evolved from the legendary Joy Division and 2) released such near-classics like ""Power, Corruption, and Lies"" and ""Brotherhood,"" I expected a better album. New Order essentially ride on cruise control on ""Republic"" (the only studio album they released in the 1990s), and they churn out some good tunes and not-so-good ones. ""World (The Price of Love)"" is a near-funky number of electro dance while the dark and moody ""Ruined in a Day"" holds up respectably. But other tracks such as the hyperactive ""Chemical"" and the near-boring ""Young Offender"" sound perfunctory and without passion. Musically, the single ""Regret"" rocks hard, but it has some of the most banal lyrics I've ever heard from Bernard Summer. One step above ""average"" but a couple below ""great,"" ""Republic"" aims for the bare minumum and nothing more. It's a record that meets expectations but never exceeds them."
1,Dissappointing,"The two wine glasses shown in the picture are NOT included as they are with other wine carriers. The leather is cheap, the cork screw is very cheap and poor quality. It was obviously imported from China although it is from American Leather. The packaging was very cheap and as an anniversary present to my husband was very dissappointing. The worst thing that I have bought on Amazon.com."
5,Understanding and Skill Needed for PERL Power,I am a neophyte script writer. I needed to learn basic PERL to set-up several web sites.The book provided me with a very straight forward process to write scripts. As a self instruction book the arrangement and flow of the text was excellent. It was a great accomplishment to see my scripts work the first time. The only trouble that I encountered is when I didn't follow the process steps in writing the scripts.I highly recommend this book.
4,An excellent reference...,"A wonderful peice of scholarly work! This book researches Umbanda (as practiced in Southern Brazil) and the socio-politics associated with it from the 1930's to 1970's.This book is wonderful for the seasoned and culturally competent person whom has a firm working knowledge of Brazil and Afro-Brazilian religions, but does not offer much for those interested in the various rites and rituals associated with the religion.Overall, a good purchase......one of the very few works done on this most fascinating truly Brazilian religion."
1,Don't buy it,The company is out of business and you can't get it repaired. Ours broke in less than a year and now we are out plenty of money with no hope of getting this thing working again.
1,"Good TV, lousy Customer Support","Good LCD TV, unless it breaks...there is NO customer support! I've had this LCD TV for about 8 months, and it performs well, especially when using the built-in HD-DVD. The remote control volume function went out, and I contacted Customer support...5 times!! (they are always unavailable, and you get to leave a message that will never be returned.) I even e-mailed them, and I still get no response."
3,Picture quality not so great,"The picture quality lacks depth and clarity. We do not have high definition, just a satellite dish. TV is a great size for bedroom with conveneint features"
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this television from Amazon.com and was very excited after reading all the excellent reviews. However, I was very disappointed with the quality of the television and returned it for the following reason.1) The DVD player was very loud and during quiet parts of the movie, all you could hear was the DVD player.2) Changing the channel took forever! If you are a channel surfer (like me) this is not the right television for you.3) The picture wasnt very good, in actuallity my old television had a better picture.I would not recommend this product."
5,Pentax Af flash 360,"We bought this for my son; he loves it. My husband wants one now, and he has been doing photography for 45 years. The only thing I have heard both say is that the directions for use are very unclear. They had to go online to a pentax forum to find out how to make use of the camera's features."
5,Great flash for Pentax DSLRs,"Not too powerful, not too cheap. It's the perfect balance of functionality, size and price. Charges quickly and does a great job of following the lens settings. Works great in wireless mode as well. Was very easy to setup, though I did have to refer to the camera's manual at least once."
3,Nice but not sturdy,I have bought this flash and own it more than one year. It is nice but it's horse shoe adpater its is plastic and edges have chirp away. Further battery door is clumsy. Pentax should concentrate on longetivity of product.
3,Good Start,I really like the flash. It is very easy to use and is very reliable. I got it along with a Gary Fong filter and it is taking some work to get consistant good shot with the two products together. I wish that I had spent a bit more money on the next flash up that pivots. I would really like to be able to bounce light off of the ceiling while shooting in portrait view. All in all it is worth the money.
3,Big glaring flaw,"The flash head only tilts, it does not rotate. That means that when taking pictures with the camera rotated in the portrait position you can't bounce the light off the ceiling. What an obvious glaring flaw. I got the Metz instead."
5,Ideal flash,"I've had this flash now for a couple years. It fits my needs very well. Some complain that it doesn't have the swivel head. I just hand hold the flash or use a small tripod for it if I want to aim it on a different axis. The wireless works great with my K200d. I love that it also has high speed sync. It is well built and versatile. If you want more power and a swivel head, you need to pay more for a flash that has those. This flash has always given me great exposures. I have no complaints."
4,It's a Fair product for the price,"It have done all was it have promise, is well built and perform very good also it have a reachable price. I recommended a lot for any Pentax camera it also give great results with my Lumix LX3 of camera flash, tough it took a wile to make it work.Update October 07 2011:The closed position for the battery compartment cover is located by sliding up. With this orientation, gravity works against the cover latching mechanism, a poor design approach. Also, is partially open (~2mm) position of the battery cover after the flash has been bumped or handled so as to tilt the flash head. There for the battery cover can and does on occasions open up making impossible to keep the flash working. Make sure teh flash doesn't get hit to prevent this. I did gve me two great yeears of performance and it does performs good, when it' on."
3,360 is not a good name for this flash!,"I mistakenly purchased this flash thinking it would give me more bouncing flexibility than it actually delivers. The name ""360"" belies the fact that it does NOT rotate even 1 degree. I just upgraded from a total Olympus digital SLR system to a total Pentax with the K10D as the camera. I now wish I had not ordered the flash as, though it delivers nice light directly and with the strobe angled upward at 45, bounced off of the built-in diffuser, it does not allow you to turn it sideways or to the rear to take advantage of larger surfaces to give a softer and more diffuse light. The integration with the camera is o.k., but it does not go to sleep when the camera does, and has a manual slide switch to turn it on. The boost for the flash is built into the flash and not the camera. I liked controlling the brightness from the camera in my Olympus. I love the K10D but not this flash!"
3,"no swivel, useless","I got it for Christmas.It has no swivel and is useless to me as I found out.I use flash mostly bounced off the ceiling. Without swivel I cannot bounce when shooting vertically (portrait orientation).P-TTL didn't work wonders; I get practically the same results with non-dedicated Auto-flash. I get more blinkers with P-TTL, because of the pre-flash.Giving it 3 stars because of the high build quality.I think I'll stick to Sunpak 383 - swivels, more power, reliable auto-flash, twice as cheap."
3,Mostly for Rypdal fans,"and possibly only the long time fans. There is much to like about Terje Rypdal's guitar style and there are a lot of good TR albums out there. But this is probably not the place to hear him. This is an odd, unclassifiable mix of guitar quartet and small ensemble. Playing a couple easy swingers and a couple would-be avant compositions and a couple interesting duets (Palle Mikkelborg's trumpet against Jon Christensen's drums). Any one might be a good composition or have a few good moments. This is an example of TR composition and a good example of how various he can be. Maybe for that reason it comes off as a directionless, haphazard mix."
3,LOW End of Nikon standards,"I have returned this set for two reasons: the diopter adjustment on the left eye(because the zoom in on the right) is not of sufficient range to accomodate my vision. 2) The zoom lever is rather light and not very smooth in operation.At the lowest 10 power, the binoculars are OK, but as you go up the magnification, the shake becomes too much for real useful viewing. I tried them out on a bald eagle on a tree across an Alaskan lake. The comparison with the regular 8 X 40 Nikon Action binoculars was disappointing."
2,magnification doesn't for for any brand period.,"I returned this product bcos it showed signs of usage, but even if it was %100 factory new I would still return it becausemagnification doesn't work on binoculars spotting or rifle scopeshere's the reasonfor you to have a clear view like 10-22x5050mm / magnification has to be bigger than 4mm. so this scope is only useful when10-12 magnification is used you still see the image when 22 times magnified but it is not that usefull, low contrast and you cant look at it long time.soI ordered same thing 12x50 (amazing price from amazon) and wont be buying anything adjustable in the future. I did my study.so for 22 magnification to work you need to have at least 80mm lens. it is simple math.you need certain amount of light to go into your eye."
3,Entry level binoculars,"This is a good entry level binocular for the price. I would recommend the fixed power Nikon above this however. The zoom feature requires additional adjustment to the diopter setting, and is not acceptable for extended glassing at higher powers. The 10x setting is very good. The diopter adjustment is too loose and can easily be moved out of focus unintentionally. I would not recomment the zoom feature on any binocular I have used in this price range. For a quick look at a higher power these are OK, but you are better off paying extra for better fixed power optics. If your use of binoculars require extended hiking or activity, I would recommend upgrading to the Nikon Monarch series which use the lighter and more sturdy roof prism design than the porro prims models and are significantly better quality optics."
5,Worth the Money,I was looking for a good pair to view object approx. .25 - .5 mile away. This Nikon did the trick. Very pleased even in very low lighting.Would suggest using a tri-pod when using 10+ zoom. Images are good but not steady enough to comprend the details.
3,"Good construction, good image at 10X, deteriorates at higher zoom","This binocular allows you to rapidly change zoom from 10X to 22X using a slider on the side of the smaller lens. This is what kills these binocs, because while the picture is great at 10X, it rapidly deteriorates as your increase zoom, kind of like the ""digital zoom"" you see in cameras where the image gets pixellated, though that shouldn't be happening. I'm not sure what the technical reasons are, but it seems like there is an additional 2.2X lens sitting in between the lens that allows you to change the zoom, and that really makes the picture really unclear and hazy. I'm going to try the 16 X 50 to see if that gives me the best of both (high zoom, high clarity)."
5,Great view,"Took the binoculars up to the mountains. I was really impressed with these. At night, saw a star nebula near Orion's belt. These binoculars work better than my friend's 70mm telescope. His scope made things larger (just slightly), but not as clear or sharp as the binoculars. The zoom button on the binoculars worked great too."
3,decent optics for the price,"These nikon 7234 are a decent purchase for the price. View is clear magnification is good. Once you start to increase magnification you see there weakness. I bought them for hunting and sighting in my rifle. These are not good for hunting they are not waterproof. I struggled to view bullet holes at a hundred yards, I shoot a 300 win mag. They are a good entry level that will satisfy most needs, they are just not for someone whos going to expose them to the elements."
2,Limited Design,"If you are a homeowner looking for good advice on how to make your hodgepodge plant junkie garden look good this is not the best book for you. The author was very knowledgeable about plants, especially those that grow in his part of England. He was also very predjudiced toward certain plants and used them repeatedly in his advice. Most of the plants he cited do not grow in my area, and the fact that he mainly used latin names, which I know for the plants that grow near me, but not for others, made a lot of extra work on my part looking up their growth characteristics to compare them to the plants that grow here in South Louisiana. I did not find this book very useful at all."
5,A book needed by amateurs stricken with the disease of gardening.,"I am giving this book a full five stars because I have yet to find another to compare it to concerning this subject matter.Living in the heart of the midwestern United States, the typical British tome offers very little of any substance to me. In spite of the fact that the author is British, I feel the book has much to offer if one ignores some of the specific plants that are used as examples. Mr. Turner instead outlines the pitfalls of merely collecting plants. Quite simply, he admits that plant collectors will continue to collect. However, he encourages and outlines techniques to establish gardening goals other than just ""MORE!"". Essentially: If you are going to collect, (And you will.) do your collecting well.The often dreadful look of a collector's garden has long been in great need of discussion. This book does a wonderful job of broaching that subject."
1,"feels like it was written in the 1960s, not the 1990s","It never ceases to amaze me how different people can arrive at such different conclusions from the same set of facts. This book is a great example of that. With nearly every page I found myself marveling at the unsupported conclusions, the questionable assumptions, and the moralistic (and misguided) value judgements left right and center. I found myself editing as I read, deleting whole paragraphs of blather as I went along. There is a set of facts about her illness, and you must arrive at your own interpretation of those facts. But some conclusions come nearer the truth than others -- and if you ask me, this one misses by a mile. If you want a book about Woolf's illnesses, read Caramagno's book ""The Flight of the Mind: Virginia Woolf's Art and Manic Depressive Illness""."
1,There are better books out there.,"I would recommend to parents and educators looking for a book on early childhood development to look elsewhere than this particular book. It is difficult to read and at times, is incongruous with current research findings in developmental timing. I question the author's knowledge and skills, and would encourage others to do the same."
2,Very well made but TOO SMALL!!!,"I had already purchased two of the Farberware 12"" lids and they measure 11 5/8"" at the lip and almost 12 1/2"" at the edge and fit most of my fry pans but this one that is supposed to fit most 10"" pans measures only 9 1/4"" at the lip and barely 10"" at the edge. I am so mad - it fell into every 10"" fry pan I had. I received a full refund from the Marketplace seller - Amazon's warehouse_deals - it wasn't their fault it was Farberware's."
5,Only for the newer pans,This lid is well made with a large and easy to grip handle and it works perfectly on my newer Farberware skillet with stainless steel on the bottom. It slips inside my old Farberware with the aluminum bottom since the exact size of similar looking Farberware pans has changed. I liked the lid so much better than the one that came with my old pan that I hoped it would be interchangeable. That does not change my feeling that this is a well made and reasonably priced lid.
4,4.5 Stars,"Overall, this book brought a major problem of social work clearly into focus: the emergence of psychotherapy. Prior to reading the book, I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to do in my future profession, but now I've slightly altered that goal. This book won't be eye opening for everyone, but much of the material presented is very interesting and thought-provoking. I am glad to have read it."
4,Better than the first,"Gate 2 is a better written and directed film than its predesessor simply because the character of terry is much more interesting than glen.The first one,which I love,was obviously made to cash in on the whole gremlins/critters craze,while gate 2 has a more focused storyline,and while the gate features great stop motion effects,gate 2`s equally great but sparse usage of them actually helps the film stand on its own as darker and more real life than the first one.All the actors,including louis tripp,who gives a quitely commanding perfomance,give the movie a realistic edge that the first gate couldnt graspe with its goofy scare tactics.All in all,a highly underrated horror film thats worthy of some respect"
3,Ok for my collection,"First one much better, but it's from the 80's which is why I purchased this looks ok in my horror collection."
2,Can You Put Together a Stereo?,"This book reads like stereo instructions! In fact, it contradicts itself more often stereo instructions. Many terms are used but not defined. Basically, if you are a student, it's impossible!"
1,contemporary literay confusion,this is a helpful book if one is more interested in name dropping than in the clear presentation of critical approaches. the author has a knack for making the obscure even more obscure. more often than not jargon takes the place of analysis.
3,Not the frangrance I remember,I purchased this frangrance for a friend years ago and she loved it. I decided to purchase this for myself and the results were not the same. The frangrance did not work for me.
3,The darker side of humanity,"While I didn't enjoy this sequel as much as the first book in the series, dwelling as it does on the darker side of political and corporate game playing, it was still an interesting read as the author presents one possible scenario of how humanity could use the gifts from an advanced culture. Another interesting rendition of the age old fight of good vs evil - and there is plenty of the latter."
1,More garbage from Wardley,"Wardley never fails to impress. That is if you're impressed by horrible products made as cheaply as possible that always fail miserably at what they're supposed to do.Their freeze dried tubifex worms are another in a long line of Wardley failures. These little cubes float on the water for hours. The fish don't bother with them. You'd be better off putting styrophoam in your aquarium.I have harlequins, tetras, gouramis, rams, plecos, danios.. and NONE of them like this crap. In fact they show no interest in it, as though it actually WERE styrophoam"
4,Solid Trays,I did not buy these trays for conventional purposes but use them to grow wheat grass and sunflower greens. They work just fine for my use. The only issue I have is the shipping costs.
2,daughter likes it ok but....,"I guess it is good enough for most 4 year olds but the screws do not keep the strings tight. I adjust them all the time and they just unwind as soon as I adjust them. This makes my daughter frustrated as she really does try to make nice sounds on the thing. She notices that when the strings are tight the sounds are different than when they are loose! So I will probably have to buy her a more expensive guitar later. It is still good for just plucking at it like mad, which some kids will do and not really care about what it sounds like."
4,Just what we needed! Looks great on a black background,"My fiance's mom needed a new computer so we freshened up an old (but good!) laptop. Everything was installed with Korean language in the OS, but we needed the keyboard to show the proper language as well!These were cheap and seem to stick very well. The color looks very clear against the dark-colored keys."
4,A bet from other works.,"I haven't read this book myself, but I have read some of her poetry, and if this book is anything like that, then maybe I should change my rating to 20? Oh wait that's not possible. Nevermind...-Chad Powers, a.k.a. Meldethar a.k.a. Dymlos"
5,great finding fun from Humongous,"My son loves the games where you try to find out what's different in each set of pictures because they are fun. I love them because they help him learn to look at items that are different and yet the same and they teach him to process different types of information. I really love anything that teaches my son how best to learn.Plus, it's Freddi Fish. We love playing Freddi Fish and all of the other Humongous games. They teach logic and order, problem solving and so many other things. It was really wonderful to find something so close to our hearts in book form."
4,quality entry level tag watch,"This is a beautiful watch. Received it as a graduation gift and it oozes class. Although it is a quartz movement instead of an automatic, I suggest that the buyer go this route because an auto. movement that is not a Valjoux 7750 mech. could be trouble. Understood???"
5,Another book in the Bible of ADD.,"Again, Drs. Hallowell and Ratey provide ADDers with another essential tool in dealing with their disability. Those who have ADD really should have this book and Driven to Distraction if they haven't it. Even if I reread the book, it continues to provide me with and remind me of helpful principles in living as an ADDer. One thing the books have taight me: ADDers are normal! We are trapped in a structure-trapped, overformalistic world that causes us to be distracted, yet has little tolerance for it. Yet the ADDer can survive - successfully. Thanks again to Drs. Hallowell and Ratey for such a relevant and helpful book - their books in fact!"
5,Answers to Distraction answered a LOT of my questions!!,"I was diagnosed with Attention Deficeit Disorder at age 51. Although my son has suffered from this disorder all his life, it wasn't until I was diagnosed with the same problem that I fully realized what he has gone through his entire life. I discovered that while I was NOT aware of having ADD until age 51, the signs have been there all my life. This book, taken from questions submitted by the audiences to the author's lectures, was a fast, entertaining & meaningful read for me. It is in short ""bites"" that are easy to understand & helpful for those of us with short attention spans. I learned a lot about the disorder and about myself from reading this book. This is the first book on ADD that I have been able to actually finish without giving up in sheer boredom."
4,I'll show you my disease if you show me yours! Respond,"That made me laugh. I have to ask do you believe in AIDS? Do you believe in cancer? Do you think people in wheel chairs can walk? If so way? Have you had any of them? Do you really know what they are like? How do you know they are real? How because science tells you and that same science also has done brain scans on people with AD/HD and has proven that it is real.So I know people without ADD can have some traits of ADD like forgetting things, sure some people can be just like that but when you forget your own birthday, always lose your keys etc, never organised, can't concentrate for more then about 2 minutes, never on time for anything, poor sleeping habits, trouble learning what others find easy etc would you like me to go on?If they sound like normal people to me god help us all."
3,If you know the answer this book will confirm your conclusions,"You can buy a book to confirm what you want to believe which is where anything with medical or psychological connotations worries me. It makes a convincing case, but there can't be many people who don't nod along in agreement and say 'that's me' when that's not the case at all - we live in a highly distractible world."
5,Most helpful for those struggling and family.,Family members and those with ADD or ADHD can look at parts of the book or all of it for many answers.
2,I could have told you that!,"I was not at all impressed with the content in this book. Here's a simplified version of the asked question and his answer:Q: What kind of job should someone with ADD get?A: Well, some people with ADD like this kind of job, and some don't. Other's like this other kind of job, and others do not.Great, nice advice.Wish I hadn't bought it."
2,a bit too broad,although it answered a lot of questions it did not do much for me.. found it hard to get in to as its loads of different sections..
3,Fair book,"Actually, I don't mean to buy this one. I planned to buy the author' another book. But admittedly,this one does answered some desired questions for people who suffer from ADHD."
4,"Cute, Practical and versatile","I like the full keyboard which is good for contacts, notes and text messaging. I also love the radio/MP3 player. I take it to the gym and can be in touch and use the phone ear plug for the radio...better than a walkman! All the GSM features plus the cool music/keyboard makes this a great phone.I only wish the letters/numbers were backlit and the problem with the keyboard is you lose the ability to map the letters back to numbers for IVR responses (like, ""please spell the last name of the person you are calling..."")"
1,Not useful as a phone!!,"I bought this phone and within the first couple of days, I wanted to return it!Pros: The features are nice, games loaded in memory and the radio/MP3 player, I love. The phone is small and portable. The keyboard is great if you are writing email or text messaging.Cons: The dialpad is too small to make phone calls (especially entering pin numbers for voice mail) practical. I'm use to using my thumb to dial; now I have to pull the phone away and use both hands (one to steady the phone and the other to push the right button). Don't think you can just enter your contacts in memory and you won't have to use the dial pad. You will if you have voicemail.I sold the phone and got the Nokia N-Gage!"
2,Cool but flawed,"On the plus side: I've had no problems ripping / downloading songs and it's great for text messaging. It's got a SIM-card which I think is different from (and better than) most US phones.On the down side: 1) the keys aren't backlit so you can't use in the dark. 2) the earphones are horrible: they're heavy, don't have a clip, have bizarrely long ear wires, and can't be ""coiled up"" when not in use (so mine are always tangled). They're impossible to use while jogging. They come disconnected from the phone if you leave it in your pocket. Finally, the mic sits about belt level, which is why you always see people holding their ""hands free microphone"" if they want to be heard. It's hard to imagine how the same company could make this cool phone & these horrible mic/headphones.In short: Fine for on the train, but not for active usage."
3,Could Not Get Service For Phone,"I tried for 3 weeks to get service for my Nokia 3300 phone. AT&T and Amazon kept pointing fingers at each other, and finally Amazon told me to send the phone back, then order a new one. I sent the phone back w/out ordering a new one (one time shame on you, two times shame on me), and I'M PRAYING THAT I ACTUALLY GET MY MONEY BACK. The phone seems pretty nice especially for the price, but alas it was too good to be true. I may just go to the AT&T store where I can get face to face service and instant activation."
1,WORTHLESS!,"TALKING ABOUT DISSAPPOINTMENT; I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT, BELIEVING THAT IT WOULD WORK. BOY WAS I WRONG! IT WAS CARRIER SPECIFIC AND AMAZON FAILED TO MENTION IT ON THE PRODUCT SPECS. IT'S THE MOST EXPENSIVE USB CHARGER I EVER BOUGHT!"
1,worthless,"I bought this without knowing that Verizon disables everything that i bought the cable/software for. Will not link in any way with a computer.This worthless, stupid cable is just an expensive charger.What a waste of time and money.Thomas Blackmon"
5,"I know he's my brother, but!.....","I know he's my brother, but, his songwriting potential is clearly displayed on this cd.....Just to get the people he has working on this album, as excited as they were, speaks for itself. I believe a big name will eventually hear this cd, and do a cover of one of the songs....."
3,LBJ - O.K.,"This book tends to becomes repetitous, but is still worth reading.The problem with LBJ wound up being not the stockade as much as the incompetency on the part of those that ran it."
3,Just a little smokey,"I thought Burning Up was pretty tame as far as erotic romances go.For those of you that have found the Kensington books a little too explicit, Burning Up will probably be more to your liking.I happen to enjoy the Kensington books and Burning Up didn't do much for me except for the excellent story by Patricia Ryan.I've read and re-read that one three times already. It's absolutely what I would have liked to have read in the other stories- explicit love scenes, angsty emotional characterizations, and the ultimate ""awe, that's soooo sweet"" moment at the end.I found Nina Bang's story didn't really have enough flow to keep me engaged or interested though the premise is unique, and I always give Nina Bang points for originality and humor though her writing style does not appeal to me. The other two stories were rather uninspiring."
2,Not Worth My Money,"I bought this book and I am sooooo sorry I did. The first 2 stories by Nina Bangs and Cheryl Holt lacked focus and there were parts left out that I had to go back to read to make sure I didn't miss something. It was not erotic or even coherent. The only redeeming story in this was Kimberly Raye's and even then it was pretty dumb. The last story by Patricia Ryan was OK but, it was a lot of money to spend on one decent story. Maybe these authors should stick to full length stories because they sure didn't develop the story or any emotional connection for me."
2,redundancy compilation,"what a money making style! This one is not dedicated to any die hard deep purple or rainbow fans, but only for youngsters who love them for the very first time. The songs are remaining the same like the other one which had been appeared in the old LP's for 20 years ago.If you love DP and its relatives bands, pls buy the original albums. Keep away from this redundancy cd compilation. Deep Purple Dramatician O. Jon"
2,Baby Grand not so grand!,The baby grand paino was smaller than expected plus it was not in the most mint condition either. There was a corner damaged at the front and the paino key guide sticker was not stuck on the paino securely. The paino itself is not as heavy as I thought it should be to protect toddlers from leaning on it and tipping it over. Plus there has been a stong paint smell that has continued to linger a month later. Overall though it is a cute first piano.
4,Redman Shows The Talent That He Is Made Of.,I think the Record shows the talent that Redman has and the potential that he has to become a driving Sax influence in the future. In this album he demonstartes the skill level that he has attained as a professional sax player along with sounding great with his Coltranelike style.
5,MORE THAN SATISFYING,A blend of old school mostly and modern jazz together.I like joshuas playing a lot because it gives you those ups and downs very well crafted in his music .Kevin hays puts his piano skills AT JOSHUAS disposal with a lot of maestry exactly when it is needed and nothing more.The final result is more than you would call it satisfying .
4,"Practical, straght-forward and realistic",Jim Sullivan has the pulse of the hospitality industry. His advise is straight forward and practical. It is easy to transfer his suggestions into practical applications in your day to day operations. We are giving this book to new managers as part of our management orientation process.
5,"IF YOU READ ONE BOOK ON RESTAURANT MANAGEMENT,READ THIS ONE","Jim Sullivan's excitement and fun comes through in his new book just like in his seminars! Jim believes in the Customers and Employees having fun! He makes it fun for Management and employees to have a great time while taking care of the top line/sales and cutting costs. There are at least three or four ideas that will work for every restaurant to increase sales. And his saying ""the customer may not always be right, but he/she is always the customer"" hits home! Quick and good reading for everyone in the Service business. I gave a copy to all my Managers and Key personal to read."
5,Technical Service Manager _ Quest Construction Products,"I attended a class by the author at the ICE many years ago, and first bought this book for my staff in an earlier positition. Now am buying a second for my new office.I have since relied more on the author and his services than the book itself, but I was impressed by the careful and comprehensive manner of his investigations he showed in the case studies he presented. Coatings is a small market, and often doesn't require or command the highest talent from us as scientists: I think Dwight is an exception to this tendency, and I trust that this excellence is found within his book."
5,"Thumbs Up, Thumbs Down","In the book Any Small Goodness, the characater Arturo gets a thumbs up. He lives in L.A. in a place where random acts of generosity and good will improve the lives of L.A. There is also another L.A. , a place of movie stars and people who are too rich and people who are too poor. But Arturo manages to survive. We like Arturo because he is a good friend that could also make him a good person. He never talks down to his friends or talks behind their backs. We also like him because he's a growing kid- just like us. Another reason is he thinks about what will happen next, the reason he has so many friends is because knows he would lose them if he talked bad about them. We make good and bad desisions just like him. We think other kids should read this book because it explains a lot about growing up."
2,I've seen better,This documentary is just a 1943 training film interspersed in strategic spots with somebody's unsophisticated hand-held digicam shots of a fan flight inside a restored B-17 bomber. The film is blurry in more spots than I'd like. I have a copy of this training film on another anthology bomber DVD and it's much clearer than the ones these folks use. While some of the film might be useful for the Scale Modeler or the WWII B-17 enthusiast on the whole this is not a professional grade documentary.
2,disappointing,"saw them play live last year, and unfortunately bought the cd at the show, before they played. dana colley and billy conway are still great. the band has tight drumming, chewy bass lines, and mind-blowing sax (and harmonica!) work, but the vocals and songwriting just aren't there. laurie sargent's voice and lyrics sound just like every other singer you hear on the not-very-good ""contemporary adult"" npr station. the only listenable songs in the set were morphine tunes, and even they were disappointing. it's a shame - if dana and billy had just looked a little harder for a new front (wo)man, this would probably be a great band. oh well. pick up a morphine disc instead, or the mark sandman box set."
5,Two of the best,"Destroy All Monsters is a Blast to see again, it's still great fun 40 years later! Gamera: Guardian of the Universe is one of the best Kaiju films made. Getting this twin pack of movies is a great deal, don't let this one go."
4,Good but not great,"I purchased this item, which I thought was to be Dirt Track Lightning McQueen, and it ended up being just a regular Lightning McQueen. This was fine, because what I received, I did not have. However, the image on this listing is inaccurate and misleading because it says ""Dirt Track Lightning McQueen"" on the bottom of the packaging. The package was received in a timely manner and in excellent shape."
3,Spiked,the only problem I had with this was that it shows it all spiked but what I got was alternated spikes and studs. But other than that it was nice and lasted a long time.
3,Average - Somewhere In The Middle,"I've been listening to this record since it came out in 1993, and i am still undecided as to exactly how good it is.In some respects, it has the makings of a classic album with songs such as ""baby go round"" & ""stupid jerk"". They're definetely trademark Muffs songs, with brilliant jamming from the guitarists.However, the track that disappointed me was ""all for nothing"".It just sounds like alast minute album made song, that has no meaning.In the end, the jury is out..and i can't see the wood for trees. On this one, i think it's safe to sit on the fence.Rodney's verdict: AverageKilt's verdict: Moderate..."
3,"Out of five, I'll go for three","I got this Muffs CD for christmas last year and at first I wasn't sure how to react. I'd never heard of a band called the Muffs before!I've listened to it a lot since then and have to say that I'd score it somewhere in the middle - a 3 out of 5, or a 5 or 6 out of 10 if you prefer.Interesting to note, I looked at Mr. Dubbing and Mr. Kilt's review and have to say I disagreed to some extent. ""All for nothing"" is one of my favourite tracks! The accordion solo is particularly fantastic (by new member Stalin, I believe).Overall, I'd have to say it depends on how you look at it."

2,What a DISASTER!,"OK, let's get this straight. 'Philip Glass' was previously on a CD compilation called 'Give Peace A Dance Vol 2 - The Ambient Collection' in the UK. But it really doesn't matter if it's been on CD before or not, because the track is not particularly inspired anyway. 'Breakdown' original version, though, has never been on CD, and it would have probably been better if it had stayed that way, since it is rather dreadful IMHO. Why was it selected for a 'BEST OF'? Should've included the brilliant second version instead. 'World Cup Theme' 7"" version has seen its first time on CD, but who cares when the superior 12"" version is already available on one of the two Colourbox CD's before? You should seek out one of those if you want to find out more about this grossly underrated band. As for this fiasco... let's just pretend that it never happened."
2,An Unnecessary 'Best of',"With only 2 previous CD's, it seems rather pointless in releasing a Colourbox best of. There is only a meagre 10 tracks (plus a video) with nothing rare or previously unavailable on CD - both the single A-sides 'Say you' and 'Punch' are omitted. The 2 previous albums are much more satisfying listens than this, and if you *really* want 'Pump up the volume', you could spend about 1/3 of the price and buy the CDSingle."
2,A Tragic Non-Event,"Quite dubiously, the 4AD label web site states that the album has been ""compiled and remastered by Martyn and Steven Young"". Let's face it - how often does a band like Colourbox get the chance to release a cd these days? It is unbelievable that they should pass up such an opportunity to make the most of it, by incoporating material that represents their most creative yet accessible work, or maybe even something more challenging, dare I suggest. Any one or more of the following would have made this a less dismal effort at compiling a ""Best Of Colourbox"" : 'Say You', 'Punch' (both 12"" single A-sides), Fast Dump, Sex Gun, Manic II or even some b-sides such as 'Keep On Pushing'(remix). As it is, the only track that is truly ""previously unavailable on cd"" is the 'Official Colourbox World Cup Theme 7"". What a waste.Colourbox deserves better than this."
4,A flawed masterpiece,Colourbox always underestimated themselves. They saw their music as a career option which possibly accounts for their easy lapse into soul and dub ballads to pay their bills when their genius should have lead to better things. 'Arena' was a Bond theme looking for a film and maybe that was what they were looking for when they could have been to the mid 80s what St Etienne were to the late 80s and beyond. One hopes that they made it into advert and film music rather than going back to pen pushing in a government office or something. The Official Colourbox World Cup Theme was used by the BBC (I think) in 2002 so I hope they finally get recognition for their prescience.
5,Love it Love it!,"I happened upon this game when I searched for a game related to the Robert Jordan books Wheel of Time series. I thought someone should make a game and someone did. Just a warning if you overlook the description this is a FPS not a RPG. However, that in no way detracts from the gameplay. As many reviewers have already noted this game is most likely not canon to the book series. However, it remains true to the atmosphere of the stories and I think that is what the developers were after.Anyway if you are Wheel of Time fan and video game fan you would do well to add this gem to your collection."
1,Too Ancient???,"I'm not sure if this game was a washout b/c it's software is incompatible w/ my Toshiba gaming computer, or what, but it just wouldn't work! Then, I couldn't get the sound of rain off of my computer until I uninstalled the download! Bad, bad, buy."
1,Not worth it,"I purchased the Titanium T-Touch Tissot a couple of years ago @ FineBrandWatches through Amazon. Batteries have short life and after two years of careful use, the hands felt off!!! Not worth it."
1,severe stomach reaction,"I had a severe stomach reaction to this vitamin. After the second attack of severe, painful stomach gas and vomitting, I suspected my problem was related to this vitamin which I had just started taking. So, I didn't take any for 10 days. Then I took another to ""test my theory"" that it was this vitamin. As I sat by the toilet most of the night in agony, I kept asking myself why I needed to test my theory. I have never had stomach problems or problems taking multi-vitamins, but something in this is new to me, potent or contaminated. I'm surprised I""ve only seen a few reviews (on other versions of this vitamin on AMazon) that had similar problems. I'd say beware."
5,very good multi,"Just like it comes at the health food store. Great brand, great product, thanks amazon."
2,Literally a Hard Pill to Swallow,"The pills are like small green bricks. I'm a fit, athletic man age 52 and I dread choking this thing down every morning. Will change once this bottle is finished."
5,Great Multivitamin,"I was taking Centrium crap. One day I decided to do some research and found out how much crap they put into cheap supplements. So I decide to go the ""organic"" route. These are easy on the stomach and has quality ingredients. While I realize I should try harder to get nutrients from a proper diet,it's good knowing that these are helping with what's missing."
3,Good and Bad,The vitamins do not make me sick when I take them and they don't have iron. The pills however are not shaped very nicely and I have been struggling to get them down I just cut my throat tonight and that prompted me to leave a review. I don't have trouble with pills usually and they aren't that large but the edges are very unkind.
1,Not a good quality,"I didn't expect tht the DVD would look a 5 dollar bootleg DVD the sound and image are terrible, did not like it at all!"
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this book largely because I was interested in seeing some photographs of the Indians of the Southeast, and the description indicated that there would be some included. However, the book only has one photograph. The rest of the illustrations are drawings and paintings. Still a good book, just not as advertised."
4,boyds bears (plush),I am new to the collecting world of boyds bears. I saw this book at a store that mainly sold boyds bears. This book was very helpful in showing me what bear was of value etc. They have a handy reference guide in the back of the book that helps you find the bear you are looking for by name. Its great!
2,Mad Scientists,"This is not a bad book however it might be kind of hard for the average gradeschooler to understand, especially where the author does some moralizing about ""there were some things man was not meant to know!"" Did an ok job in commenting on movies like the Fly and Jekyll and Hyde. God I loved all these books -- they made a really bad childhood somewhat bearable..."
4,A great blues/ jazz singer,"On this cd Ernestine offers up an ear feast of jazz, blues, and popular music. Some jazz purists may be put off by the choice of material and background vocals. You can definitely feel the hand of Ouincy Jones in this production (although he is not the producer, but it is on his Qwest label). Some standouts are Night in Tunisia (This is one of the best sung versions of this song), the bluesy, Wrong number, the gospel feel of, One Child and the finger snapping, This Can't be Love. Ms. Anderson has a strong, clear, soulful voice with a blues sensibility. The production is top notch. Highly recommended."
2,Wrongly listed item,"This item was labeled as the honeycomb cover for the HTC Inspire but was obviously made for another product. The cover is loose on the phone, has cut-outs for the camera on the wrong side of the case, and the Coup de grce...was greasy and somehow sticky at the same time.I realize this was a Boxwave issue so I have not dinged Amazon."
1,Only Buy OEM,"Well, the pass side hydrolic motormount went out on my zx3 so i decided to buy a whole new set of mounts and replace them all for piece of mind. The car has 160k on it and the mounts were original. With in 2 weeks during stop and go driving or acceleration i would hear a loud bang like the motor was shifting. I drove it to work all week and got it up on the lift on the weekend only to find the mount had been torn badly. The stock one was still in the hatch (glad i saved it) i put the oem mount back on and the car drove fine. So basically i wasted time and money buying this part. I hope the ""Anchor"" hydrolic mount holds up a little longer.... because the dogbone mount is more of a paperweight and less of an anchor..... :( Save the frustration and buy ONLY OEM FORD MOUNTS."
1,worked 1 hour only,"I was so happy i installed my brand new rear motor mount on my ford focus 2002, i tested it for about one hour and was very good. what was my surprise that the next morning after 30 mins of driving, a worst vibration from the original i had was taking place in my car, i checked and the motor mount was shaking terribly. i needed to put back the old one, althoug it vibrates, is not that terrible as with the new one. really dissapointed."
1,Terrible Quality,"I replaced the original engine mount with this on my mother's 2001 Focus. Three months after installing it the car would make a noise as if the engine was hitting the subframe whenever you accelerated from a stop or coasted and then accelerated. When I took this mount out to replace it, the entire center piece that connects this mount to the subframe was disconnected from the rest of the rubber."
1,Anchor mount failure,"The large rubber insert in this mount broke less than 2 months after installation. It is definitely an inferior product. I'd recommend replacing the rubber inserts with polyurethane in the original mount, which is much sturdier, if you have access to a machine shop. Otherwise buy the Ford mount."
1,Buy OEM instead,I bought this Anchor mount about 3 times. The mounts broke within a month of use. I would buy OEM instead - though it will cost more.
1,Do not buy this item!!!,"Do not buy this item. I had one installed on my 2007 Ford Focus. Recently, I noticed jerking in the engine compartment. I put the car up on ramps and noticed this mount had completely come apart. The rubber bushing on the large side had completely come apart. Do not buy this part."
1,Very poor toaster,"I've used this toaster daily for a couple of weeks now, and the only thing it has going for it is looks and price. I read Amazon reviews for everything else, don't know why I didn't in this case.The first problem is that it doesn't toast evenly. Some of the ""coils"" don't seem to get hot (red), so there are bands in your toast that aren't browned. It has to be turned up very high to get the whole piece, then the rest is so hard it's unpleasant. Plus, that makes the cooking time much longer. Secondly, when the toast is finally done, the bread doesn't come out far enough so that for even a regular sized slice of bread your fingers have to touch the hot toaster to get the piece out.I absolutely do not recommend this toaster."
2,Worst.Toaster. Ever.,"This toaster has so many problems it is hard to know where to begin. It takes FOREVER to toast even something small like an English muffin. Forget something solid like a bagel. It would be quicker to build a camp fire and toast it on a stick.The ejector doesn't lift small items (like the aforementioned English muffins) high enough to get them out. I have to slap the ejector upward and catch it in mid air.I gave this 2 stars, because as bad as this toaster is, it still makes toast.... eventually."
1,Takes forever to make toast,This toaster is fairly cheap but it takes forever to make toast. I just do not have the patience to use it anymore. Buy something else although it seems nothing works very well.
1,Piece O Junk,"This toaster is really bad and I should have thrown it out sooner. First the exterior.. It takes up a lot of space because it's big and bulky. Be careful how you clean the outside as the black plastic scratches easily. On to how it doesn't work as a toaster.. It takes forever to toast bread and doesn't toast evenly. I keep it up to the last setting on the dial just to get it to toast the bread. The slices don't fit down in it either. I found that the tops of the bread stick out. Also impossible to get smaller pieces out. Like an English muffin. I've had to buy wooden tongs just to get the bread out. If your a connoisseur of great toasted bread, don't buy this!"
2,Not made to last. Uneven toasting,We've had this about a couple of years. It stopped holding the bread down. We had to bang the handle down and change the settings willy-nilly to get it to finally stay down. It has never browned evenly.
1,Very slow and uneven,We've had this toaster for 6 months. It toasts unevenly (one side always darker than the other) and takes forever to toast anything. By far the slowest toaster I've ever owned. I'm looking for another.
2,Worked fine until it broke... one year,"I didn't mind the cord coming out of the front rather than the back (why do so many toaster manufacturers do that? Makes not sense at all.). Controls were great, and it toasted fairly evenly. The slots were wide enough for bagels.But now the lever won't stay down to activate the toaster, after only one year, so I'm buying a new toaster. Cheaply built (feels plastic all over) and obviously not built to last."
3,mediocre,"This definately has the feel of a cheap, mass-market art book, and considering what is currently available for this sort of price, is not worth what they are charging. The photos of the drawings are poor quality and generally slightly out of focus, while the layout is done in that rather annoying way of cheap art books dealing with the graphic arts - namely overlapping illustrations, drawn borders around pictures, and occasional patterned borders to the pages. The text is spare, but informative, and the book would have been much improved with more of the contemporary photos of the productions. However, as a significant number of Bakst's wonderful designs are illustrated, the book is ""better than nothing"". I am awaiting a high quality calalogue raisonne!"
4,Very good for begginers but not an advanced level book,I would not advice this book for somebody with advanced level of French. But it may definetely help out someone with a begginer level.
4,Great information about tribology,The book is easy to read and understand. I use it very frequently and it is important to my work
2,Pretty but flawed,Bachmann's 4-4-0 locomotives look great but have problems. The tender carriage is so low that it will not clear some switches and crossovers. It constantly jumps track. I have had this problem with two different locomotives. The wheel assmebly on the tender also comes apart easily. I have had to use glue to keep it together. The two locomotives have also had other problems. The wormgear that drives the wheels is bad about hanging up. It causes a squeeling sound and the loco flips to one side. Both locomotives did this right out of the box. Another problem is that the motor is actually in the tender with a driveshaft to he engine. This makes the engine itself too light to pull much weight. If you want a better 19th century locomotive get an Atlas Mogul 2-6-0. Would run up the wall if asked to.
4,First Book I've Read by M. J. Rose,"I honestly wasn't sure what to expect of this book, but I really enjoyed it. I read it in one sitting! I liked the way she presented an inside look into the life of a call girl. How it wasn't about sex so much as the men feeling accepted, unquestioned. I think Rose shows deep insight into the nature of human sexuality as well as marriage through Dr. Snow's character.I also liked that she developed the characters more fully. Showing us not just Dr. Snow's professional life, but her personal one as well and the struggles with her teenaged daughter.The highest praise I can ever give a book is that it was worth the money and the time to read it -- and this one was! I will be looking for the next one in this series."
1,"Fortunately, it was a Kindle freebie","You shouldn't be able to guess well before the end who the bad guy is, but it's glaringly obvious--well, except to our heroine, Dr. Morgan Snow, who's not the brightest. Actually, she can be super smart when it serves the plot and super stupid for the same reason."
3,Luke warm feelings...,"about this book. It was ok but most of the characters just felt lifeless to me. Cleo was interesting but the others were boring. Dulcie? What kind of name is that? I hate it when writers give characters weird names as if it makes them more interesting when all it does is distract us as were trying to figure out how to pronounce it in our heads. I've never heard that name so unless it becomes a movie, I'm unlikely to ever know if I'm pronouncing it right.I got the second book in this series for free so I'll go ahead and read it, maybe the characters will come to life a little more the second time around."
4,The Halo Effect by MJ Rose - A Review,"Morgan Snow is a sex therapist and a freshly divorced single mother of a preteenaged girl. One of her clients, Cleo Thane, has Morgan more than a little intrigued. Cleo is a high priced prostitute. While she performs her job to the satisfaction of her customers, she is having difficulties with a personal relationship. When Cleo disappears, Morgan feels compelled to help find her.Morgan is a deeply complex character fraught with anxiety for her daughter and Cleo. This anxiety has it's roots in her own childhood.MJ Rose's writing is rich with detail. She not only tells us what her characters are seeing, but what they can feel physically as well as smell. The plot is fast moving and tightly woven.I look forward to the next in the series.Highly recommended!"
5,Can't put it down,"The opening of the story alone will take your breath away.I usually don't like stories told in first person, but M. J. Rose knows how pulls it off."
5,The Halo Effect...will not disappoint,I really enjoyed this book...had a hard time putting it down. The premise of the book was fresh and not overdone by several others. I will definitly be looking for more books done by this author!
2,"2.5--okay writing, interesting premise","This was a mostly enjoyable read, the first book in a thriller series, although M. J. Rose's voice is always problematic for me. In some books it grates so much that I have to stop reading, but I was able to get through this one.The heroine/narrator spends an awful lot of time in early chapters explaining herself to the reader--and not all of it is relevant to the story. The heroine also does some rather stupid things which mostly seem to be more for the author's convenience in moving the plot along rather than a genuine outgrowth of her character and motivations. But the story starts cranking after awhile, and there's an interesting hook up between the heroine and another character. I wound up enjoying it enough to buy the next book in the series.However, Ms. Rose clearly did not do sufficient forensic research on blood coagulation. Perhaps only a forensic nerd like myself would give a darn. If I could give this a 2.5 I would."
3,The book was a slow read for me.,"I bought this book because it had such a high rating. I was dissappointed. It was not the page turner I expected it to be. It did pick up at the end, but this does not get a 5 star with me."
2,"Little plot movement, unengaging characters","I read 200 pages and then donated this book to the library without finishing it. The characters weren't engaging, and there was very little plot in the first 200 pages -- just a lot of thinking and talking by the main character. It certainly wasn't enough to make me think that the second half of the book would justify the time spent reading it."
1,1 for 2,"I bought a 2pack i needed for an assignment at school, when i got it, there was only one. it was the same price as any other 2 pack, with both packs in it, but i needed it and didn't have time to send it back or do anything about it."
3,Grow chart not quite tall enough,"It is a really cute grow chart for a little boy. However, I was disappointed that it was not taller so it would last longer during our grandson's important growing time."
2,The Journalist's Craft,"hasn't helped me so far, but that could change, I flipped through it and ... so far it hasn't met up to its reviews, at least to me -- how to hook a reader, and keep them engaged, but I may just need to red more of the essays"
1,Amazon did not send the item,I asked for this item but Amazon sent me an empty box without any watch inside. The worst thing is that they charged my credit card. I have been contacting customer service but after 1 month I have not received any solution.
5,Tah Heuer Link Quarta CJ1110.BA0576,"This watch is fantastic. Looks great and simple to use. Really pleased.The small circles relate to the stop watch, hours (top left) and hundreths of a second (top right). The bottom circle provides seconds.The second hand on the main face only moves when you are using the stop watch. The second hand with the red tip again only moves when using the stop watch to provides details as to the number of minuses. This watch can provide split timing.Really comfortable to wear."
3,Not the sweetest,As a rule I absolutely adore ralph towners guitar playing and have done so for 30 years. The first 7 or 8 songs are gorgeous and some of the nicest guitar work I have heard but after that the music goes into what I could only define as 'experimental mode. I was totally disappointed with the second half of the album. I own about a dozen other towner albums and will continue to buy his music as his work is too good to miss. I've played guitar for almost 40 years and understand the need for musicians to push the boundaries a little in an effort to remain fresh but as listener some of the music is not pleasing to the ear
2,A brief book with little to recommend it,"Jonathan Schell said what he had to say about nuclear war in ""The Fate of the Earth."" That book is required reading for anyone interested in the topic. He followed it with ""The Abolition,"" which expanded the same themes and added some new information. But it wasn't essential. Now he's written this short volume which adds nothing new.He tries to find a new angle by tying the threat of nuclear war to Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness."" But the analogy doesn't work; it just isn't there. I was disappointed by this book. If it wasn't so short, I would have quit after 50 pages. But don't let this stop you from reading Jonathan Schell's other books."
2,did not have enough variety,"It did not meet my expectation, it did not have enough variety. there were no replacements that fit the old broken zipper."
1,Not easy!,If I ever figure out how to use these I might be a genius.......The instructions were not very helpful and I failed to be able to fix the little bag I was trying to repair.
2,Not recommended for clothing,"I bought this to repair a broken slider.+ Provided the parts to repair, but these only include zipper sliders and stops- I didn't receive an assortment of zipper colors, and only got *gold* stops, so when all was said and done my jacket had a gold sparkly piece at the top (the rest is white with a gray zipper).- The instructions are worthless. Look the repair instructions up on youtube.Don't buy this. I would recommend going to a crafts store, buying the singular parts you need and can see while in store (they can't cost more than 2-3$ alone) and then watching a YouTube video."
3,Collection of zippers worked for me except the zipper end,It proves clear and good instructions on how to replace your zipper. I had a broken zipper on a fleece sweater and jacket and was able to keep them going with this kit. The reason for three stars and not four or five is the zipper stop is kind of small and didn't really stop the zipper from being pulled off from the top of the zipper. Otherwise it is a pretty good kit for getting your zipper repaired.
3,okay product,There were too many zipper heads I couldn't use but was able to repair two zippers so it was worth the money. Maybe I will be able to use the rest of the heads in the future.
1,worthless in my view,Needed kit for winter coat. Zipper is not a heavy duty but the largest in the kit was too small. Directions were very vauge. Wasted money.
2,not as expected,This item is not what I expected and has been used. It's not something I can use and I wish I had researched it better before I ordered.
2,Mostly useless.,"It says flat out in the instructions that zippers with broken boxes/pins CANNOT be fixed. This would have been handy information to include in the product description for those of us who are not zipper experts. In my experience, the box (the main bottom part of the zipper on the slider side) falling off is the main reason WHY a slider comes off, so I really question the usefulness of this kit. I suppose if you're just dealing with a broken tooth or a missing slider with the box still intact, this kit may work for you. Otherwise, it is a waste of money."
1,Waste of time and money,"I purchased this item to in order to repair a hooded sweatshirt and a jacket, to my surprise none of the included parts fit either garment. The kit contains the following: Four pairs of zipper sliders which allegedly fit the most common types and two pairs of zipper stops for zippers with missing or damaged teeth, not very helpful unless the damaged or missing teeth happen to be at the very top of the zipper. The kit is overpriced for the contents provided and I believe the inclusion of some zipper boxes, the rectangular piece located at the bottom of the zipper, would have been helpful."
2,Sizing is the issue,"I wasn't able to use it as the largest size in the variety pack is still too small for my coat. The larger (outdoor) kitZipper Rescue Kit-Heavy Duty might have worked.Therefore, cannot comment on this item usability.Be careful with the size you may need, although given lack of description on the item, it will still be a guesswork."
5,Clever!,"What a great way to present poetry -- through shapes! The text of each of these poems is cleverly patterned like its topic, with adorable illustrations enhancing them. For example: a poem about rain has the words drizzle down like rain drops and then form the shape of an umbrella. The poems themselves are fun and representitive of some of childhood's most engaging activities and holidays. Poet, Heidi B. Roemer, has a true poet's ear that taps into the heart of children. Hideko Takahashi's illustrations of children of all colors are irresistable. Her bold and muted coloring seem to find the right balance to add even more delight to each poem. This book would be great in the classroom when studying poetry. It's a great way to introduce new poetry styles to children. But, it's also fun to read and look at. If this book doesn't get young ones hooked on poetry I don't know what will!"
3,Missing item too. Hope Amazon makes good on it.,"I received the set today and I, too, am missing an item. I am missing the bonus Silverpoint knife. I have written to Amazon and hope they do make good on it.The knives were sent in a cardboard box, stuffed with rolled up packing paper. Each knife had a cardboard sleeve. But an extra sleeve with no knive in it. I assume this sleeve was for the missing silverpoint knife.The knives had little white dots on the handle but removable with a little water and wipe. The steel had streaks but also easily cleanable.But for $154.99, I really expected to get the whole set as shown and written above. Be sure to check yours, it's easy to pass over it. Just waiting for my reply...."
1,Item not as described. Missing most of the knifes.,"The only knife that fit the label was the cook's knife. I got that, a carving knife and a little 8cm knife. THAT's IT!!! The empty space in the box was stuffed with tissue papers.Totally unacceptable. I am returning this."
4,Coyote Ragtime Show Complete Collection,Great story line enjoyed chareters. Not too short. I like for my animies to be at least 300 minutes or more. It has just enough action to keep you interested.
1,Poor - Drawings very dark,"I LOVE Dore's drawings. He is one of the absolute masters, and the Dover Book of his biblical illustrations is wonderful; however, I cannot say the same of this book. Yes, the drawings are Dore all the way, but they are dark - very dark - for the most part. The front panel is the opposite of what one sees inside. Almost all of the prints are gloomy and dark. Thus, I cannot recommend the book."
4,A Good Overview,"This book is a good place to start reading about American presidents. After reading more detailed biographies, one will probably come to different conclusions than Professor Dallek."
4,baby grand,"it is great, Taylor loves it....the bench is a little small and unsteady but otherwise it sounds great and looks great"
4,Works well.,"I bought an electric toothbruth at the reccomendation from my Orthodontist. I bought it at the time I got braces and anticipated needing a bit more cleansing power than a manual brush provides. These replacement heads fit my toothbrush just fine. I am not sure how long they last without braces, as it seems I am replacing the head about every 4-6 weeks now. Braces are hard on the bristles, though, so I expected that."
1,Fiasco. Won't order again,"They sent me wrong brush heads. Not what I ordered.I didn't want to deal with these people again. WhenI asked my money back, they said I had to takeit with Amazon. I haven't received my money back yet.Save yourself the headache. Order your brush headreplacements in the Internet from the big land stores."
4,A Gift,"I bought this as a gift for my friends, as far as I have heard they have enjoyed it and not had any issues."
1,Impossible to Clean,"This waffle iron is flippin impossible to clean. No overflow area around the outside means that it literally spills all over the outside of the machine (including the power cord) when using. For a good guide to buying a decent waffle iron, check out Alton Brown's Good Eats episode titled ""the Waffle Truth""."
1,HORRIBLE Waffle maker.,"Claims to be ""easy clean""--what a joke. I hate this waffle maker. It is IMPOSSIBLE to clean. Move on."
2,TOO QUIET,"Now I like a toy every now and then that has minimal volume. However this one is just too quiet. I thought it was the batteries, but no.It's cute for the money. Keeps her occupied for 5 minutes."
3,Classic jersey want to be,"This product is not a classic jersey, just a cotton long sleeved T-shirt. The logo is not a sewn on applique, but an ironed on vinyl transfer. It is definitely not a $39.04 value, but rather an $18 long sleeve T-shirt with a logo on it many times. I have represented this product far better than the seller. Buyer beware! If you like spending a lot of money, at your favorite race, on cheap souvenirs then this is worthy of purchase."
2,Where's the sound?,"After trying many brands of strings, this brand wound up being my least favorite. The tone is very light and hollow. If you are looking for a good set of light strings, try earthwood frailing, or spring the extra bucks for the Elixr. They will give you a much healthier sound."
3,Are these the best strings? No. Are they good for the money? Yes,"As far as banjo strings go, these are a good bang for the buck, or were when I got them. D'Addario makes a pretty consistant product, I've used them on everything over the years, although I prefer certain brands for other things. Strings are cheap for the most part and easy to experiment with. These are also amazingly enough still made in the USA as well.If you buy a cheap instrument here, do yourself a favor and get a decent set of strings as chances are they'll be strung with trash if it's a lower end instrument from China. Even if you're starting out you should tell the difference right away."
1,Never came in,"I ordered these awhile ago but they never came in. This could have been a one time problem that happened to me and is most likely not going to happen to you, but doesn't mean that I am not upset about it. Be sure to contact the seller if it doesn't arrive."
4,Nice Unit - Attractive,"This is an attractive set--nice because the speakers are separate and can be positioned away from the radio/CD player. The CD player sounded good. However, I was disappointed--it won't play MP3 CD's. That's the main reason I ordered it since it was advertised as MP3/CD Player with Digital AM/FM. If you don't care about playing MP3 CD's it's a very nice unit for the price. I returned mine the day I received it."
3,Radio works great but CD plays one song and stops,This was a Christmas gift for my sister in Jacksonville Florida. The AM/FM radio works great but the CD player will only play on song and then stop. The GPX HM3816DT MP3/CD Player with Digital AM/FM would not play MP3 disks. One nice feature is the speakers detach from the main unit. I'm going to have my sister return this for a replacement.

Great MatchStone Cold Steve Austin vs. Bret HartGood match entertaining and fun to watch."
2,Cheap Intake Hose and HORRIBLE customer service,"Spend your money elsewhere. The intake hose, which is made out of cheap vinyl, will spring leak after a couple of days. Good luck trying to find a replacement. E-mails to the manufacturer's ""customer service"" go unanswered. Don't waste your time or money"
1,HAVE A STRONG BACK!,Reel is exceedingly difficult to unwind. Rewind process works ok.I have less expensive model that works much easier. My recommenation would be to avoid this product for the reasons mentioned.
1,Hot garbage,Great comedian but should never put a DVD together on his own. Didn't even keep the DVD. Waste of money
3,SO SO,Perhaps I'm getting a bit jaded.Some of these comedians don't move me at allTried watching this and it couldn't keep my interest
3,No Audio came with the book,"I think you have to select the audio type with the book, or doesn't it come with book at all?"
4,Excellent source book,"I actually had Dr. Watson as a professor, and I have to say that the book made up for what he lacked as a lecturer. (Great guy - just slightly confusing. He has a lot going on in his head. Dedicated scholar.) It is an excellent resource for someone who is not very familiar with the time period. The primary sources in the appendix are extremely useful for research purposes, and the narrative is easy and engaging."
2,Not what I expected for the price!,"I am a hairdresser that specializes in weddings and I was very disappointed in this book. When I purchased it there were no reviews, unfortunately. It was beautifully put together but the hairstyles were really unflattering and unattractive. There were hardly any I would even show to a bride as a potential, they were too out of date. The instructions were not detailed enough for a beginning hairstylist (I'm assuming that was the target reader group). I would recommend Martin Parson's ""Hairdreams"" instead of this. Although you can tell the authors worked hard to make this a lovely book, they took some serious wrong turns in the hairstyle picks and instructions. I wouldn't be so harsh if this book wasn't so expensive!"
2,Beautful Cover Deceives You...,"I expected the whole book to be about hair and have a wealth of hair styles. I really didn't need all the advice the first part of the book gives. I also expected the book to have more updated styles. This book would definately look pretty on your salon reception table and would appeal to a novice. But someone who is doing bridal hair now might not find this book helpful. If the cost was less, the book might be worth keeping."
4,great voice,great voice and performance. really has a great future. My reason for 4 stars was that some of the song material was weak
3,"Pretty good, but ...","I had never heard of Sophie Milman when this CD showed up as a recommendation. Based on the reviews, I figured I'd give it a try. I am glad I did. She has a nice voice and many of the songs are new to me or nice renditions of familiar pieces. But ... there had to be a ""but,"" right? ... I always tend to compare jazz singers to Diana Krall. That may not be an appropriate comparison, but there it is. For me, Diana Krall is the standard when it comes to contemporary female jazz singers. I have all of her CDs and have seen her 6 or 7 times in concert. Sophie Milman ain't no Diana Krall. She's very good and I enjoyed the CD, but not as much as I wished I would based on the other reviews."
1,WORST jazz singer on the planet!,"Don't waste your money or your time! Doesn't even deserve 1 star, except for the great musicians playing with her. Two things wrong with this ""singer"": 1. She has ABSOLUTELY NO idea what the words MEAN in the songs she sings. She puts inflections in all the wrong places in EVERY SONG! 2. This ""pretender"" has the WORST, un-schooled tremolo ""shake"" (it's certainly NOT a vibrato anyway). Her only saving grace is her somewhat good looks. I have no idea why they keep playing her on the radio! She can't compare to great Canadian female jazz vocalists like Emilie-Claire Barlow or Diana Panton, Carol Welsman, or a host of others. Every time I hear millman on the radio, I have to change channels - or turn it off - FAST!"
4,"Nice easy listening, jazzy vocal with nice style and delivery","We used to call them touch songs. Maybe they still do. In fact some of the songs are the old Marlyn Maye songs, such as ""People Will Say We're in Love."" But each song is unique, with different styling.The rhythm is superb. Sophie's voice is mellow and lucious. The instrumental great.Her voice has a nice range in the lower vocal range. But she reaches some of the higher notes easily too. She is a very versatile singer.This is a great, easy listening album.Highly recommended."
4,Not as good as her first album.,"I saw Sophie Milman at ""Jazz Alley"", in Seattle a few months ago and loved her. I had to buy her first album, when I was there. I was that impressed. She played a lot of songs from that album and a few songs from this one (which I enjoyed), but I think, as a whole, this album is slightly less impressive.I was a little disappointed with her rendition of ""Fever"". My favorite version is Peggy Lee's, so that's a little tough to match.This is a fine album, though and I recomend buying it."
5,Great collection of rock songs!,I think its an awesome collection of songs by one of the most influential rock bands in the recent past.
5,now this is a definitive collection....,"well, well, well, somebody over at universal music finally had the decency to put out a complete documentation of def leppard's long career. having this collection in your hands should make 1995's 1-disc ""vault"" basically obsolete. i guess we just had to wait 10 years for the record company to get it right. don't have to talk about the song list, all the hits are there, also with the more popular album tracks from all of DL's studio albums. if you got the cash, go ahead and get this excellent overview of the 80's/90's rockers finest, and scrap that single disc 'vault' on over to the used cd shop."
5,A Def Leppard must have,"If you are only going to buy one Def Leppard CD, buy this one. Disk one is your usual radio fanfare greatest hits that you'll hear any day on the radio (and essentially, an enhanced version of Vault released in 1995). But Disk two is the better half in my book. I would change 3-4 of the songs to a few of my other personal favorites, but this CD set really captures an eclectic mix of this bands ability and talent. Factor in that all songs have been digitally remastered and it is a win-win."
5,It's about time ...,... that I got this definitive work of Def Leppard! Hope all who purchase Enjoy it as much as I have.
4,good sale but took too long to receive,"I didn't realize that the CD was coming from overseas. That explains why it took so long. It was over two weeks....Not a big problem, but I would try not to order Internationally next time."
5,"love it, love it, love it!!!!!","If you were a child of the 80's, this band will take you right back there.... This is by far the best selection of DL hits I've come across."
4,"A More Complete Collection Than ""Vault""","This is a pretty good collection of the 20 odd year career of Def Leppard. It is a much more complete retrospective than the ""Vault"" collection which totally ignored their first album and ony had one song from their second. If you've been to their concerts, they usually concentrate on albums 2-4, so more songs from ""High and Dry"" makes sense. The only thing I don't like is that it makes their first greatest hits collection obsolete. Disc 1 is the ""Vault"" plus Catch 625 and Heaven Is. It would have been better, in my opinion, to just release disc 2 as ""Vault 2."""
3,not complete,"if you really want the best of def leppard, buy ""pyromania"" and ""hysteria"" instead of this. they really were at their peak with these two albums and while they had a couple other radio hits before and after i don't feel those other albums are worth buying. if you need a collection for the car or whatever i would go with ""vault"" the first greatest hits collection as this contains all the radio hits on one disc."
3,this Retrospctive best covers there Career for me,I liked a few Def Leppard cuts but I was never all that much into them.they were a Huge arena Rock act back in the day without really leaving much timeless music.but some of the cuts here are good to listen to in reflecting upon another musical time period.but this covers all you will ever need from this Band.
4,Fast Delivery,"I ordered 3 different DVD's from 3 different merchants, and this DVD arrived first. Very timely, well packaged, no damage. Husband loved this movie"
1,Wrong...,"I guess this author doesn't bother to check his ""facts"". Too much work perhaps. Many, many errors. Clearly, he didn't even bother to read Asimov's autobiography completely. One of many errors: He thinks Marty Greenberg and Martin H. Greenberg are the same person. In Asimov's autobiography, he says in several places they are 2 different people. Asimov goes to great lengths in his autobiography to stress they are 2 different people. So much so, that he he refers to MHG as 'Marty the Other' in several places. This is just one of several errors. When someone makes as many errors as White does, how can you trust anything he says? Although Asimov wrote fiction and non-fiction, White seems to have blended the 2 in one book. However, how can you tell which part is fiction and which part is non-fiction?"
5,Best mustard ever!,"Used to be able to buy this mustard in almost any cheese shop at a price thought high at the time ($9.00) - but no more...it just seemed to have disappeared. My family used it exclusively and we all had uses for the crock, too. So I began a search for my mustard and finally found it on Amazon. It made my day!I love the mustard itself - so different from the usual; this is only seeds, water, spices, etc. For the last few years have been buying it on Amazon. Use it on everything - sandwiches, lamb chops, deviled eggs and still love the crock it comes in. If you Google ""Pommery Mustard"" you can get recipes and rave reviews from restaurants who have incorporated into their menus.It's a bit pricey because of shipping, but worth every penny and it lasts a very long time. Have told friends about it, and once people use it they never want to go back to the yellow/brown/ supermarket type.Thanks Amazon, you came through again!"
3,hello goodbye,"This book was okay, but the pictures are fabulous. I'm so glad that it won the Caldecott Award and I loved the extra details. The colors are sweet because they are mixed together and the scribbled out parts look great. I'll try to look at the pictures a lot more."
3,"Like the story, not so sure about the illustrations","They just aren't my preferred style.I like that the little girl is biracial, and that her grandparents are a biracial couple, that's always good to see (especially when it isn't A Very Big Deal). And I do like the way the colors in the book pop out. Not sure I like how it's done, though.At any rate, it's a well-written story, full of just the sort of details you'd expect a five-year-old narrator to put in, and it's clear that everybody in this family loves each other very much. Definitely check it out."
3,window review,"A sweet, simple book about the joys of grandma's house, expressed from a child's perspective."
1,Not a Good Book,"I purchased this book because of the glowing reviews, but was most disappointed by both the illustrations, which were too loosely drawn to almost make the images unrecognizable, and the story which was of little note in that it wasn't interesting, fun, or insightful."
4,A Ok Book,I liked the pictures. The story was good too. It was creative to make a blob then scrape it to make the picturers.I liked all the pictures so I don't have a favorite.I LOVED the book. IT WAS A GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Scribbley Colors,"Though it didn't speak to me, this book could be very useful with young children to explore the idea that they can write about anything, even a window at their grandparent's house and what it means to them. It also introduces quotes in a very simple and non-intrusive way.The pictures in the book are abstract and very colorful. Young children might find them fun and whimsical. I cannot decide if because of the abstractness I think they are not very detailed pictures, or overly detailed pictures. Overall, I didn't find this book that great."
5,"The Hello, Goodbye Window",Great illustrations. Wonderful book to give children the opportunity to see how imagination can play into their own world.
3,The ok book!,I thought this book was only ok. But the part I liked was when she said sometimes the queen of England would stop by. And that is why I gave the book 3stars!
2,A WONDERFUL WINDOW,"I thought that your book was okay but you could have done beter. It was better than most books but maybe not the best. I did LOVE that one night sky picture. The book was better than nothing. I really like your teqniche of illistrateing how you can scrible and the way you color with craon and than scrtch it off. You could of maybe made the ""MAGIC WINDOW"" be more exciting. The pictures are not slopy and that is GREAT!!!!! I was not a fan of the words in the book but the pictures are awsome!! There is really good teckture and color in the pictures!!! I am going to be honest it is not my favorite book ever. I will say that you people who wrote the book THE HELLO GOODBYE WINDOW really worked hard!!! thank you for your time!!!!"
4,"the hello, goodbye window",Book was purchased for our grand daughter for grand parents day at her school - teacher called her to front of the room and read the book to the first grade class - we received a warm thank you from the teacher
2,Didn't care for it.,"I just don't particularly like it, and neither do my children. The story isn't interesting and the illustrations aren't engaging. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, and since my copy just takes up space on our bookshelf, I will probably donate it to the next church fund raiser. After all, it's in perfect condition."
2,it was ok,"I think that the book was ok, I liked the illusations in the book. the story was short. this was the first time that I ever read the story in fact this is the fist time that I ever heard about the book,my opinion on the book is that the book is funny, weird, and amazing!"
2,The widow of seeing,"I didn't care much for this book but there are some pages thatI thought were very colorful and very well thought-out for instencents I thought that the page with the night time sky was a very nice page and very, very , very well thought-out. And the way you made the people-well just didn't quit satisfied my wants in this book. I really hope that you could make another book a little bit better!!!!!!!!!"
4,The fancy picture book,I didn't really like the book but I loved the pictures and my favorite picture was the night sky because i loved how the illustrator drew the stars.
3,okay book,The illistrator took time to illistrate the book. He was very creative. But it was hard to get the main idea.
4,"The Hello, Goodbye Window",I really liked this pictures in this book. I was glad that it won the Caldecott Medal. I really liked the way the illustrator used color and scribbled out parts of the picture to add details.
3,The Potato,The book we read was The Hello Goodbye Window. The Hello Goodbye Window was okay. The drawings were GREAT! but it was a weird story. The people did not look good. The girl looked like a doll. The story went with the drawings. I just wanted the pictures and the story to be better. When thougt of the story I thought it was funny and it was. That was the only good job they did on the story. This story is not exlent but it was okay. The drawings were awesome then the drawings on the cover. I liked the The Hello Goodbye Window. This is the end of my review.
5,mellifluous artistry and voice,"this book resonates on so many levels i hardly know where to begin. the simple truths, metaphors; are expressed in a comforting voice; the illustration is whimsical, playful, brilliant; recalling for me glimpses of postimpressionistic art. from beginning to end, it portends an atmosphere of what children's literature is really all about: reaching the heart of a child, staying there for a bit - and leaving with a lifelong memory-imprint. bravo to this caldecott winner, a wonderful addition to every child's shelf."
3,"The Hello, Goodbye Window","""The Hello, Goodbye Window,"" shows the excitement one little girl has when visiting her grandparents. The story is voiced through the little girl's point of view. She expresses the excitement and joy she has had when seeing her grandparents. The story may capture the attention of children from ages 3-7, where many may connect to this story. The book brings back that sense we went through as a child visiting relatives. The pictures illustrated are very captivating to the young audience which shows diversity and great times."
4,"The Hello, Goodbye Window",This is a colorful story about what a child sees through her window. It is great for teaching children creativity.
4,"Hello Goodbye, Window.",Iloved it's Illistrations. I loved the Illistaterd art texture.Everbody should read it!
5,Delightful and Endearing,"My daughter is 6 years old, and this is one of my all time favorite books we have ever read. It captures the sweet and magical love between children and grandparents. I loved the illustrations and the text is like something taken right from a child's mouth, in the most simple and poignant way. In my mind it is a classic and something I will be buying for children for many years to come."
3,I liked this book,i liked this book becase the pichers were sweet. and i liked how the chararacters looked in this story.
3,The Hello Goobye Window,"This book is okay, but the pichers are great. I'm glad that this is a winer for caldecott medal.I love your color."
3,An Okay Book,I thought the book was okay.I liked how the illistrater was creative with his pictures.
4,The Hello Goodbye Window,"I gave it 4 stars because it is a great children's book with beauitful colors, texture and pictures. But it wasn't my thing."
2,"The Hellow, goodbye Window",It was good but not my favorite. One reason it was good is because the pitchers. (thay where good.)
2,The Okay Book,This book was okay. The pictures were kind of interesting. It wasn't the best book I ever read but it was still good.
1,Undeserving of the Caldecott Medal,"It is bewildering how this book could have been chosen the winner of the Caldecott Medal. The drawings are mediocre, and the palette is unappealing. The Caldecott Medal is supposed to be for distinguished picture books, and there is nothing special about this book. There are so many other illustrators more deserving of this award. The judges who decide the winner obviously have no background in Art."
4,Not as engrossing as other Olivers I've read,"For the first half of this book I found it a little disappointing, especially after 'Lord Gresham's Lady,' 'An Unsuitable Match' and others by Patricia Oliver. The heroine, Regina, seemed to be a spoilt and selfish little madam, which is unusual for Oliver: her heroines are usually sensible, intelligent women with a well-developed sense of humour. However, Regina did improve later in the book, and I ended up enjoying it.It was interesting to encounter both Gresham and Wolverton in a book set before both of their own stories; I would also love to see Oliver write a book with David Laughton as the hero. He has cropped up in a few of her books now, and he sounds intriguing as well as having a mysterious and sad past."
1,On my unfished shelf,"I bought this book a couple of years ago because of its place in the series of Oliver's Corinthian books. I started it but never finshed it - except for skipping to the end to see how it came out. Why - I thought the heroine's behaviour was so childish and self-centered that I lost patience. I find that my enjoyment of any book - but any romance most of all - depends on the development of the principal characters. If I don't like the people, then... so long. I have lots of other books waiting to be read.PS - I was reminded how much I disliked REgina when meeting her again in Oliver's latest - about Daphne (another loser, sorry to say).PPS - Please don't be put off the entire series by these two books - the first ones are excellent!"
3,Macross II the Movie,"Though this is not on the same level as the original Robotech, Macross II, the Movie has all the elements and excitement of the original with attack of a new type of Zentradi,(the Meltron,) and a little more with information on the background of UN Spacey as well as the world at large since the destruction of Earth's surface. With the subsequent melding of the Zentadi and Earth residents, it also sews up a few loose ends from the Robotech series. Its not very long and focuses on a young reporter named, Hibiki, and follows his exploits in the attempt to expose UN Spacey and prove they are withholding vital info from the general public and is replacing same with propaganda. All the while he is trying to hide his association with a young girl he befriends after finding her abandoned during a Zentradi attack. You still get the military action and excitement while a bit of suspense is peppered in with an ending that will please even the most die hard Robotech fans. Enjoy!"
5,Lots of fun! Not too Over the Top!,"I won't review the movie here..I'm sure all of you have seen it! As with much Anime' there is some really fantastic music! It made me a fan of Mika Kaneko! The opening tune ""Hush like 200 Million Years"" is a real RAWKER! The closing tune ""Lovers Again"" sounds almost like Journey would if Steve Perry was replaced by a Japanese singer! The full versions of those songs can be found if you're willing to do a bit of hunting. ""Lovers Again"" is also out there in a Karaoke/Off Vocal Version!"
4,Macross II,"Exceptionally animated, realistic imagery and exciting technological diagrams. The story line is a bit short but the characters are very interesting. You see, with Robotech animated episodes, the plot is more true to life than Transformers, I think Robotech is targeted for mature audiences and people who aspire to be engineers of aircraft and military weapons, albeit fantasy but they say boys will be boys and I admit these cartoons were a powerful source of inspiration and motivation in my daily life when I was a young boy."
5,AOK by me!,"I really enjoyed this one. It basicaly has a Good story, Good animation, and gosh darn good voices and sound effects. A friend of mine didnt like the story but I did...has a few twists Kind of Just like the series. Hope U enjoy this as Much as me."
2,Every Anime fan I know of said this was a mistake to make,"No, I haven't seen it and perhaps it would be quick to judge without my seeing it, but every Anime fan I know of who has seen it essentially said it was awful. So awful that in fact all sequels based upon the Macross universe just pretended that the events in this movie never really happened (Just like Highlander II)I'd spend my hard earned bucks on something else, like Macross Plus (now there's a good Macross movie)"
2,This is not Macross Plus! This is Macross II!,"Every review I have read here is talking about Macross Plus - an entirely different series produced several years after this. Macross II is the first sequal series to Macross. The first half is an intriguing set-up for a series, but the second half is lackluster and delivers no real pay-off. PLUSES: The character designs by original Macross designer Haruhiko Mikimoto are fantastic. The animation and space battles for the first half of the story is great. The universe feels like a natural extension of the original series. MINUSES: Poor second half, both in terms of animation quality and storytelling. Overall, a worthwhile diversion for Macross fans, and any fan of Mikimoto or Kawamori's designs. And still light years better than Macross Zero or the infantile Macross 7 which inexplicably ran for many years. Enjoy."
3,"Not bad, but could be better. Not at ""Macross"" Level.",It's not a bad anime.But the story lacks the 'soul' and the connection with characters that you have with the original macross. Another story that uses the macross name and have no direct relation with the original story.
4,La Fundación continua,"Después de leer la Trilogía de la Fundación falta algo, la historia no puede terminar ahí. Este libro entrega lo que faltaba. Una busqueda de los origenes en el Futuro, ir a los límites. Asimov muestra que el ser humano continua siendo escencialmente el mismo, es decir muy curioso. Todo lector de la trilogia de Asimov debe leerlo."
2,False advertising!!,Item not as described. You only get pull and not back plate. I feel it is false advertising althouhg Amazon is not charging me for return and promises a full refund. I was really looking forward to installing the new cabinet pulls and for the 1st time I am disappointed in Amazon. This Item needs to be corrected.
5,High power with high comfort,"The wide field of view and long eye relief on the Stratus 8mm make high-power viewing a joy. It also takes a Barlow very well. Saturn and it's moons are stunning, and I even use it on faint galaxies. I will buy more of these great eyepieces."
5,about Habil Aliyev,He is the greatest musician of Asia. A wonderful man that the world will never see like him again.Farid AmiriAn Azeri from Iran
3,Not what I expected,"I have purchased this product at a much higher price in stores. I was glad to see it being carried by Amazon at a lower price. I was disappointed in the quality however. There was at least one ""woody"" palm heart in every can. I have never had this happen before when I had purchased them locally. To have an entire case like this was quite an unpleasant surprise! Palm hearts are one of my favorite foods and I will purchase them again, but will probably try another brand."
3,Hearts of Palm,"I have ordered this brand lots of times before. My 5 year old grand daughter loves, loves, loves hearts of palm. In the past, each can contained 4 or 5 huge palms. None were ever hard. This last batch is different. Each can containes 9 or 10 smaller hearts, and several times she has come across palms that are extremely hard and impossible to eat. I checked them out myself, so I know it's true. Overall, their product is good, and reasonably priced in comparision to other brands of palms, this shipment was somewhat a disappointment."
1,Terrible,"I am a huge Hearts of Palm fan and I thought this was my answer to affordable Hearts of Palm. The first can I opened was inedible. I'm not going to try the rest because I don't think this was just a coincidence. Ohhh well, I'll stick with market HOPs (Reese)."
2,The book was as rocky as the characters in it.,"I saw Jessica Hagedorn speak at the 92nd street Y, which is where I recieved her book. Once I began to read the book I became absorbed into her book. Jessica Hagedorn does a good job at describing the essence of the bohemian/ punk rock culture. My only problem was that the book became really confusing once in the middle. The beginning of the book was straight forward and easy to read, but once Rocky becomes pregnant , the whole book seems confusing. The book became really boring once it got to a certain point, and I became really dissapointed."
2,"Holy Christ!! Can you say ""Clutch"" worship?","To the point: If you like Clutch, then you won't like a clone of them! What makes Clutch special is they have a sound all their own that they created. It's like trying to rip off Foetus or Nick Cave. Don't think I am slamming Sugar Daddie, their heart is in the right place & I think in time they will hopefully find themselves. Blood For Blood RULES!!!!!!!!!"
1,Pretty earrings--poor workmanship,The closure came broken so I sent them back--no problems with the company accepting them. They were very gracious and apologetic but I didn't want to take a chance and order another pair.
4,Very Small but Pretty,These earrings are very pretty. They shimmer in the light and the opals are fiery. I was disappointed that they are so small but my husband thinks they are beautiful. It's best to wear hair back over ears so that the earrings can be seen.
5,Very nice,"Very nice. Happy I didn't have to get the rice-paper-with-squares standard divider. This one isn't so tall, and is quite classy and solid."
5,Works as it should,"This is a replacement fan. It does nothing for performance. My fan was failing and either not spinning or running at half speed due to bad brushes.This fan fit its place, works well and has been for nearly a year."
3,As good (and bad) as any other leg attachment,"Length:: 2:57 MinsThis piece of equipment gets the job done. But the max of 200 pounds is one drawback. The limited range of motion is another drawback, but then again, I have yet to see a leg attachment that has a full range of motion. I guess you need a dedicated extension/curl machine for that."
1,Useless...,"I purchased this film believing that I would be able to use it with my camera (I have the most basic one you can imagine). The film would just not fit in. Also, I don't know of any Polaroid camera (available on the market these days) which would be compatible with this film. If anyone has an answer, feel free to let me know... Anyways, I lost 38 bucks (shipping cost included) for a film I simply won't be able to use. I am angry about that because the seller was not specific enough when mentioning the compatibility..."
1,Sparks and heat... very little illumination,"This is a tired book.... Reading it you get the idea that the author never quite got over the 60s as he rales against all the things any self-respecting liberal would have then. If it's something that business or government or the rich do, it's automatically suspect if not out-and-out evil. Eugene Debs would be proud of it, but Solomon's rants suggest he's run his course and can only hope of punditry to pay his future way. He screeches about workplace safety, just to take one example, but doesn't take into fact enormous improvements over the years. (Workplace accidents now stand at something under 7% of what they were in 1913, according to the latest research from the CDE... but then, they're a governmental agency, so must by lying, right Professor Solomon?) This is a Lone Ranger book... tedium, tedium, tedium-um-um. At least the cartoon are moderately amusing."
2,the Wisdom of Solomon,"Why read The New York Review of Books when Norman Solomon can tell you why the local news weaterhman knows less than he does about the world. Yessiree, Norm's smart guy, smarter than you anyway, and he lets you now in this book. He doesn't pull his punches, he tells it like it is, blah,blah,blah,blah,blah. If you're a typical communty college would-be radical, this is your man. Otherwise, thre are about a million more illuminating authors in the world."
1,Flash Over Substance,"Another account of how the media, and hence all of us, are all controlled by white guys in suits. Mr. Solomon uses the rubric of corporate media control as a vehicle to uncover his real agenda that is anti-U.S. foreign policy, anti-free market, anti-military, and blame America first.I was really hoping for well-thought-out, reasoned arguments but all I found in here was the same tired leftist mantra that yields little positive results in the real world."
1,"Well-written, but I hated it because(watch for spoilers)...","of major character death! Some people prefer not to read books that will leave them crying for hours on end, myself being one of them. Readers should be warned that the characters they have fallen in love with through the first half of the book will meet an incredibly gruesome fate, and will be replaced by much less likable characters... Jamie and Jenny. This book was well-written, but should not have been marketed as a normal romance novel without some warning to readers that it ends so horribly. So, actually, my problem is not with the book itself, which I would give three stars normally, but with the marketers of the book. I sat down to read this book as a way to relax during my fall break from college, and wound up crying for three hours straight! Read this book, because it is a nice enough way to pass an afternoon, but do not go into it expecting hearts, flowers, and a happily-ever-after as I did."
3,Cruel,"In this book, fate is playing with some people, putting them through all kinds of hardships, suffering and disasters. Sometimes it made me so sad I just had to put it down. It had some sweet moments too, but all the bad things were just too much for me to bear. I liked it if the lives of the heroes aren't too perfect, but here there was just too much suffering. I feel so bad :("
2,Book reads like written for grade schoolers,"I think that the whole aspect of hitting the road and going on tour with a band is just about the coolest thing that a person can do. Thus, this book seemed like the perfect read for someone like me. But when I got the book I was dissapointed in the fact that it seems like the author took five or six stories from the 'The Babysiters Club' or some other book for young kids, rewrote them to include drug and music references, and than sold it. The writing is just not very good and the stories are all lame. A girl's mother realizes her 16 year old daughter is right about being on tour, a girl runs from the cops and gets away, a ticket is fake, ect. Those in themselves aren't even that bad but the way he writes makes it a boring read."
1,lame,not very well writtennot very inspiring storiesfocus' on more of the seedy side of tourI'm sorry I bought it
2,Could've Been Much Better...,I bought this book assuming that the stories therein were non-fictional. I didn't think that someone would spend so much time simply making up bogus characters. I was mistaken. This book also glorifies drug use in a very distasteful way.
5,Excellent,"This book is very, very helpful. It introduces the grammatical concept, notes any important exceptions, gives a few helpful examples, and then lets gives you several practice exercises with a full answer key in the back. It is extremely comprehensive, covering the Present Tense, the Narrative and Conversational Past tenses, the Future Tense, and the Subjunctive Mood. The Modal Auxiliaries are given extensive treatment in all tenses. Early on I was frustrated that it did not seem to indicate which form of ""Sie"" it wanted you to conjugate, but then I realized the fragments in the exercises actually form a cohesive narrative and you can induce which form of ""Sie"" it is by simply following the story. This book is also an excellent way to build your vocabulary; whenever you encounter a verb or noun you are unfamiliar with you can jot it down and look it up. Overall highly recommended for the intermediate German student. (Beginners look elsewhere)"
4,The start of something BIG,"This album, Werner's first, stands alone as a great album. When viewed in the light of what came after, it is a testament to the talent of this performer. Many artists would love to be able to create one album as full of wonderful writing as this one. The fact is that her later albums are even better! Your collection isn't complete until you own all of Susan's work, so don't scrimp here. This album is worthy of a spot in your top twenty singer/songwriter CD's!"
5,Keep this book handy--it is the grammar guide to have!,"I love this book! It is never more than an arm's length away from my computer. There have been many instances when I needed to look up a simple rule. It was usually a rule that I knew at one time but couldn't remember at that moment. In Nitty-Gritty Grammar, I always find the answer to my question. If you have grammar questions, (and who doesn't) this is the book for you!"
3,low quality paper & missing updates,"It is a map but it isn't updated and, for the price, I expected better quality paper. Shipping was fast and the map arrived in good condition but, I'm not impressed given the price I paid."
5,"Great price, good product.","Still using this product after 6 years. Good price, strong, safe.I am happy with this purchase.Will be back to Amazon to order more related products."
4,Pleasing and Interesting,"I like this record Neil did in the early 90's, right in the middle of another ""wave"" of appreciation, as Neil puts it, for the man's music. An acoustic album dealing with Neil's acoustic fare. You get to hear several updated, more intimate and soulful versions of earlier material. The performance of ""Helpless"" here, is, in my opinion, the definitive version of the song. The interesting aspect of this recording lies in the subtle yet effective changes in tempo and feel Neil achieves. ""Like a Hurricane"" is showcased in a shockingly different way that one is used to hearing, it is truly compelling. ""World on A String"" and ""Mr Soul"" as more bluesy, slower acoustic renditions. Each track is a winner on this well recommended album, for those people new to Neil, this album should be up high on your ""to get list"""
5,neil wins - hands down!,"Second to Dylan? (bio) Are you serious? Neil Young blows Dylan away! I won't say that Dylan isn't a talented song writer, but listening to his voice is torture. Young is the total package. He can write incredible songs, awesome musician and has a voice you want to hear more and more of. I know this will catch slack from Dylan vans but oh well...."
5,Excellent customer service,Yes there was a problem with the item when it arrived but this was very quickly remedied by the seller.
1,Fraud,"Know this guy. a fraud from the start. knows nothing that was not taught to him by real triggermen, and passes it off as his ""new & imrpoved."" Was let go by one we (work for) international company as a trainer for back door actions. Black Belt Magazine let him go when his real CV was investigated and found to be ""innaccurate"".Neve been anywhere or done anything where he did the real work. a posser cop with the natural ability to make people blind to his BS.Look to the companies who do DOD/DOS training for quality training."
3,wish it had more,"the infomation on the dvd is good, i wish it covered more terrorist/counter terrorist actions."
3,USA's Up All Night,"I remember seeing this on USA's Up All Night. Yeah, the jokes were crude but all in all it was a good film in my opinion. It had some good scenes in it. It's weird the other Meatballs films are on DVD and this one isn't. Sad really."
5,Master OF The Rare LASERDISCs Movies.,"I have MEATBALLS II on LASERDISC,'nd I am waitin to get it on DVD too,,one of my Favorite Comedies ever :P"
1,"meatless ""meatballs2"" mess","this is one of the worst movies of the 80's and maybe of all time. not one laugh,chuckle,or even smile to be had in this waste of time film and of your life. 90 mins. you'll never get back.the pits, no stars for this mess"
1,Awful movie!!,This movie has absolutely nothing to do with the first Meatballs. It was so awful. What was with the alien anyway? My advice? Skip it!!!
1,Defective dvd and returned.,"I found this dvd to be defective and returned it and was charged a return fee for it. I was most unhappy about this, but there seemed to be no recourse. Very unsatisfactory."
4,great product for the price!,"i bought this violin and an amp recently. i am an experienced violin player, so i fixed the bridge, but when i tried to tune the e string, it snapped. i happened to have an extra for my acoustic, so i put that on and it has worked great! i LOVE the earphone plugin, because it gives me the normal sound, and it is quieter for anyone else in the house. this violin also has pretty good tone without earphones or an amp. i had to replace the shoulder rest, though, because it was pretty cheapy and to flat for me. ( i unscrewed it and now use a normal shoulder rest.) the bow is made of fiberglass, and is very cheapy,so i use my bow from my acoustic. i really like this violin, but if you're not willing to put alot of effort into ""customizing"" it, then this might not be for you."
3,so far mixed review,"I bought this for my daughter, its a great toy and a very beautiful object and it sounds nice but more experienced reveiwers are right that the strings are stiff and the bridge is high and the bow is too soft. I will have to take it somewhere to get it spruced up so that it is easier to use. but all in all I am glad I bought it."
3,impossible to play,The bridge has an absurd geometry; it is impossible to play the violin before replacing it.The lacking violin body makes jumps to higher positions dangerous.Other features I could not yet evaluate.
3,The electronic Violin,"This is a very fine little instrument--it functions well and it is not hard to look at either--with its very futuristic appearence and attractive styling if it ever became unfunctionable for what ever reason it would still make a great decorative piece, I will state for the record that the company that shipped the unit to me must have been in one damned hurry to close out the day or get the item on the truck as it was very poory packaged and although not damaged it was nearly hanging out of the box when it arrived at my home."
4,"Cool design, fun for the money","Slick and interesting design, fits nicely in your hands to play. I bought this for a young man who just wanted to try to play electric violin for fun. The strings broke immediately, and we bought tuners to go with it, separately. After changing these things, it's a honey. This being his first violin, I can't attest to the sound quality--maybe in a few months...?"
3,Acceptable by the price.,Recently it buys one of these violins. The violin needed refining luthier. The violin is totally plastic. The black pieces are not ebony. They are of plastic. After being sharpened and to polish the bridge to him. It is sound improved enough although even it has a little electronic noise of bottom.
2,More for decor rather than function.,"The price of this violin I must admit, is economically priced to sell. However, the quality of this violin is far from something I would ever play. It seems to me that it is def. massed produced so lacks attention to necessities of what musical instruments need. Function. Poorly crafted....."
1,Its okay But...,I love the way it looks and stuff but i just got it today and the quality is horrible.It has only one tuner. on the E string. Im supposed to play this in a couple weeks. i can afford to buy new tuners er watever.This wasted my money i saved up for about a year.I am young and i dont have a job or anything.it took forever to raise the money to get this. now i get it and i cant even play it.i cant tune it or anything. how am i gonna play it?the quality is horrible. i expected to get an electric violin thats in good condition. its broken instead.i just wasted my money. now how am i gonna play in my schools concert?Kinda a rip off...
4,one fine r&b cd,"i think unv did some wonderful tunes on this cd, though there are some hip-hop tracks but they are not so bad as to keep me away from listening to it. i really love the group, especially when i listen to ""when will i know;close tonight;hold on;no one compares to you and my favoured ""something's goin' on"". i don't regret buying this cd, it is ""rythm & blues"""
5,"""Decca Sound"" at his best","Besides the ""epochal"" interpretation of the magnificent Wiener Philharmoniker and the presence of the - maybe - most famous Beethoven piano interpreter of the XX century (Backhaus is here at 75 of age (1958-'59), and his five concertos are worth alone the price of the entire set), all the recordings are a perfect example of the astounding sound quality that Decca's engineers could achieve in the decade 1958 - 1969.Absolutely recommended!"
4,A total cliff hanger!,"I loved the entire book but the end of the book is sweet and sour! I mean the end was a total cliffhanger because of the way it ended. Now I am going to have to persuade my mother into taking me to the bookstore TODAY to get the 8th book I just can't wait till tomorrow to get it! The one thing I dread about finishing the 8th book is waiting till the 9th book comes out, so Mrs. Stanton if you are reading this, PLEASE hurry with the 9th book I cant wait to read it! Also to all the people who are ordering this book, what a great idea. I am 13 and when I was a kid I hated reading, but this book has just made my love for reading come alive. Please buy it and give it to your kids (especially horse lovers) and let them read it!"
3,not as good as the 1999,I found this years book to be lacking some pictures. I buy the book to help me make choices of what I will purchase this year so that was a let down.
5,Limo 101,"The book was fantastic. It was very comprehensive in its scope. I was concerned the book would only contain pictures and some fluff on how to build or buy a limousine.The book is so much more than that. Every vantage point was explored making for a truly interesting read. Chauffeurs, limousine company owners, and passengers were all included and shared some interesting anecdotes. If you want to know whats really going on behind the tinted glass-get the book. If you are in or are thinking about getting in the limousine business- get the book.In conclusion the book is well thought out and does a great job of bring these magnificent vehicles to life."
5,this is a good cd and a good singer who made it,"this is a really good CD and I listen to it almost everyday. This is good quality country singing. Ann is very talented, both with her voice and her guitar playing. She is also a very good performer. I love this CD and I hope you like it too. She is amazing!"
1,"27"" diagonal piece of junk","I haven't bought a new television in years, and I ASSUMED that a JVC would be just fine. What a mistake. If this is what picture quality from a brand-name manufacturer has come down to, then the world has gone horribly wrong. This thing is TERRIBLE. The picture looks all jumbly and mushed up, and the sound is awful - like it's coming from out of a metal garbage can. You really can't get a good idea of picture and sound quality from inside a huge, loud big-box store, can you? What junk."
2,beautiful product but terrible customer service,"I returned this pendant because it was a little larger than another baby shoe that I wanted to wear it with, but it was beautiful! Unfortunately I have yet to have my return processed, which was mailed out a couple weeks ago. When I contacted NETAYA regarding when my refund would be issued, I was told that they ""would look for the box and email me when it was processed"". I wouldn't recommend making a purchase from this online retailer."
5,A pleasure to read,I went the school at which the author taught. His brother first told me about the book. I quickly purchased a copy and began to read one of the best books Ive been exposed too. The story chronicles the life of Amrita Gill whose parents were murdered in the 1984 delhi riots. She comes too seattle where she lives with her aunt and uncle. Untill one day she meets a man from India that changes her life and leads her to the path to answers questions of her past. This is a gripping book and I suggest it to anyone and if you are from India Punjabi or are interested in Indian history..this book sheds some light on key events that took place
1,Lost my Pictures!,The N75 is the first SLR camera that I've owned that failed to rewind - twice. This meant the loss of two valuable rolls of film.There was no explanation other than an E (for error) and the camera FROZE UP.There is no manual rewind - forget this dangerous camera - its unreliable - ceck the Interent for others who have had similar problems - they are out there.
3,Philly Steps,"I heard this version of ""Yes I'm Ready"" on the radio and loved it. I don't know how many times Barbara Mason has re-recorded this song but this re-mix is very good. The rest of the album is just filler junk but this 7 min. gem was worth it for me."
2,a website would have been better,"After thumbing through this book, I came to the conclusion that it could be adequately replaced by a website with the same content. Actually, the website would be more promising. For it could be updated easily, and the companies it mentions would have links that go to them.A book of this nature is primarily a reference. It's not like a novel or textbook, which many people still rightly prefer, for reasons of convenience or ease of reading. While you might indeed go through this book page by page, it is like the phone book. If you had to use a hardcopy of the latter, or an online query, what would you use? Likewise here."

3,"The Roof, The River, The Revolver","Dozer is the main band where musicians from Greenleaf most of the time focus their energies and creativity, ""Through the Eyes Of Heathens"" is the latest release from this sweedens and its a great piece of hardrock and alternative metal a blast of an album specially the insane ""The Roof, The River, The Revolver"".I Havent tried the prior albums to this record, maybe in the near future so I can make a proper and more solid opinion, in the meantime ""Through the Eyes of Heathens"" deserves 3 out of 5 stars due to the energy they are capable to capture on tape.HM"
2,not reccomended.,"this deck removes nearly all helpful symbolism and replaces it with quasi-shamanistic, badly-drawn, badly-colored images. this deck could possibly be used by people who value the political statement over the real learning of a tarot system, but for all others, steer clear."
4,"a powerful deck, but a bit *too* positive","I've had this deck for a while, and am quite attached to it. Many of the images are powerful and resonate deeply, particularly for a woman used to the masculine bias of the Waite-Smith and similar decks. But some of the images (by one of the illustrators, I'm not sure which) are a bit scattered and even scribbly, and overall the deck is a bit *too* positive; it lacks the acknowledgement of the darker and more painful side of life that made traditional decks have, which keeps me from giving it the 5 that I might otherwise have awarded."
5,love it or hate it,"The Motherpeace images are lovely--at first they appear childlike, but after a closer look the observant person can see that the drawings are well-proportioned and have a playful sense of movement and color. The deck is very affirming, and even the negative images always hold a key to turning the meaning around; for instance the 9 of Swords has a flaming sword that symbolizes the mind cutting through its own deceptive creations.If you don't care for the dead white people Tarot tradition but are interested in learning the underlying structure of Tarot, this is perfect for you. I've enjoyed it very much."
1,A Very Poorly Conceived Deck,"This is not really a tarot deck; it is a political tract. It appeals, really, to a VERY limited audience, but those to whom it does appeal defend it vigorously.Its main attraction, I think, is its venomous male-bashing throughout. In fact, it is very generous in its misanthropy. The authors' philosophy draws heavily on the colorful and not unentertaining works of Mary Daly, but, sadly, Noble and her accomplice take Daly's ravings seriously. The deck suffers for it.This really is not a life affirming deck in any sense.The artwork is unskilled. The deck's roundness is gimmicky, not useful."
1,Surely They Jest...,"The authors of this deck, that is. I mean, I have read some of the other reviews, and to me, the bigotry evident in this deck is inarguable. The artwork is a notch above cave paintings--which may or may not be intentional--and compared to some of the other decks out there (like the Thoth deck), it is very inadequate.The authors' ""wild wanton womyn"" theme is so mannered and tedious that one quickly tires of the deck. True tarot decks represent true diversity with a wide range of archetypes. The Motherpeace deck limits itself to one archetype (the Matriarch) and very narrow variations thereof.The authors express a blatant dislike of males and maleness--in the book more than the deck, although it is VERY clear in the deck once you have perused the book.This might make a good gag gift if you have money to burn, but, really, it is quite unpleasant."
3,DANCE OF THE SCORPIONS,"ACTING IS GOOD, BUT AUDIO LEFT MUCH TO BE DESIRED - TOO MUCH BACKGROUND NOISE. ALTHOUGH I GENERALLY ENJOYED THE TAPE, I ADMIT I WAS QUITE PERPLEXED AT THE ENDING, SO MUCH THAT I LENT THE TAPE TO A FRIEND WITHOUT COMMENT. AFTER VIEWING IT, SHE CALLED AND ASKED ""WHAT HAPPENED AT THE END"". WISH I COULD FIND A BOOK OF THIS TITLE SO I COULD READ IT AND DETERMINE WHAT WAS INTENDED."
5,A real treat,This is a really good product. Excellent flavor and constant texture. Can be added to salads and made a wonderfull dip.
5,Chocolate Moose,This is my second pair of these moccasins. The first is still wearable after more than ten years of use. Very comfortable on a narrow (C) foot.
5,Moccasin Review,"The product showed up in a timely manner, in perfect condition and all at a great price. Will definitely re-buy from them."
1,Run very small.,"I wear size 11. Reviews said these run small. I'll say. I ordered a 11.5 wide, and these measure a full inch shorter than an Uggs moc in size 11. Beware: If seller says free shipping and easy returns, that means YOU pay for the return even though the product is not right."
5,A Light-Outdoor Moccasin,"These moccasins are great. They are very comfy and have a rubber-soled bottom so you could wear them outside, but the moose hide is so delicate I am keeping them for indoor use. They do run a little tight, but they're supposed to--Apparently they stretch out a little as you wear them so if they start out very roomy they will just get too loose."
4,Comfortable Moc,"Loved the moosehide moc. Wish the sole was a little softer. It's very hard and even after a lot of wear, they tend to slide instead of grip on most flooring."
2,Great shoe with size issue (UPDATED after 7 months),"This is a great shoe. The leather is very soft and it has a good sole. Makes for a very comfortable shoe. However be aware . . the sizes are on the smaller side in width and length. I wear a size ""10 D"" in any other shoe I have purchased. However in the two Minnetonka shoe products the ""10 D"" was too narrow and too short. For me a size ""10 1/2"" or ""11 E"" fits okay in this shoe.UPDATE: After 7 months the right shoe's sole was no longer attached to the toe of the shoe. Looks like maybe the stitching was too close to the edge of the leather. I super glued the toe to the sole, so far holding : ) I wear these a couple of days a week. Very disappointed in workmanship!"
4,Moccasins,"I bought these for my husband and he lives in moccasins. He says alhtough he likes them, they are not very comfortable to drive in. This may change after they are broken in. Overall they are well made and very comfy looking."
4,Start out snug...,This is my 3rd pair of these in a decade & will continue to purchase them as long as nothing drastic changes about the construction. They will feel small for a few weeks but eventually will stretch out to be a true-to-size for you. Every time I begin the wearing of a new pair they seem toooo little for me. Start wearing them without any socks & in a couple of months you'll be able to wear socks with them. I wear mine about 12 hours everyday. Thanks
5,shoes4dad,They shipped very quickly!! I ordered them the week before xmas and they arrived within three days. Excellent product. Minnetonka moccosins makes a high quality slipper!
5,Barefoot without being barefoot!,"These are lightweight and the moose hide is the softest and most subtle leather shoes I have ever owned. They are not lined which is perfect for me since fleece or flannel lined versions are always too warm. I work from home and find them more comfortable than going barefoot or just socks that I wear them all day, 7 days a week. However, I don’t know how well they would hold up against the elements since I use them exclusively as an indoor shoe, but the construction appears to be of high quality and I suspect they would hold up as well or better than any shoe of similar design.This is one of the those rare items that you end up liking so much that manufacturer has stopped making them when you need to replace them. If you want footwear comfortable enough to forget you are wearing, give these a try."
5,excellent,"have worn these shoes exclusively for the last 20 yrs. of my life. they always fit out of the box,wear like iron, and make me sad when they are so worn that they need to be used for lawn work only."
2,I really wanted to like them,"I ordered these to replace a pair I bought 8-10 years ago, but they were too small to wear. I returned them and ordered the next size up, but they were too large to wear. Apparently the quality control with Minnetonka has declined over the past few years. After racking up significant shipping and return shipping charges, I finally ordered a pair of the camp mocs, which were too wide but I kept them because I was tired of wasting money. I emailed Minnetonka about the size variations but they never bothered to respond. If you are going to try a pair of anything from Minntonka, I would recommend you use a company like shoebuy.com due to them paying the shipping and return shipping due to the size variations."
3,Quality seems to have slipped,"My husband has worn these shoes for years. They used to last. The previous pair lasted only 6 months before the seams started breaking and his toes started sticking out! Hopefully, this pair wll last longer or I will have to find another brand of shoe for the money."
4,Almost perfect,"This is truly a wonderful shoe. As others have said, the leather amazingly soft and will stretch. My only complaint is that there is not enough padding or arch support underfoot. I like loafers that support almost like athletic shoes; these do not. While there is some padding, they're almost flat on the bottom and I'm concerned that they will feel like walking on pavement, over time. If these had better support, they would indeed be the world's most perfect loafer."
5,Runs small,"I normally wear a size 11; but, am re-ordering in a 11-1/2. Have worn Minnetonka moccasins for 40 years and still love them."
1,useless,"Not good enough, even for amateurs, beginers or deaf people.Poor construction, ridiculous mono earbuds. If you dont have money to buy a better one, use floor monitors."
3,"Pretty good, but not like the ""live"" version...","This band is a great but the songs are a bit too perfect here in the studio... I suggest getting the double CD called ""Extended Play"" featuring the same line-up with a much improved performance... Here the songs lack the alertness of that the live performance brings out... Over all, still a pretty good album though... Especially track 6!"
2,ONE DIMENSIONAL-- TOO LIMITED,"Reading the glowing reviews of others, I can't believe we're listening to the same CD. My problem is that the vibraphone by its nature sucks all the attention in its direction. Hence the very limitations of the instrument boxes in the rest of the band. I don't care how many mallets are stuck between the fingers the sound is one-dimensional. It is a serious mistake to let this particular instrument dominate an entire album. Most people find the sound of the vibraphone pleasing at first only to tune out later. This is a shame in that this is obviously a quality effort on the part of the band.I'm sorry. All the pieces run into each other and I had the repeated problem having my attention drift to other matters (""I wonder how many pencils DO I have?""). Mr. Holland should have mixed things up more."
5,hp ac adapter,product arrived quickly and was exactly wht i needed. also very low price which makes it even better!
4,Very Good AC Adapter,"I am happy with this AC Adapter, at first charge/power up it ran warm, but once the battery charged it cooled down and has not run as warm as the 1st time.I ordered this product because it is a OEM Adapter and the cable is good quality, thick and flexible. I recommend this product, great price and great performance and excellent shipping time."
5,'Portrait' of a great singer,"I remember buying an album back in the mid-1970's - Emmylou Harris' ""Blue Kentucky Girl"" - on a trip to Colorado, and eagerly waiting to get back home to play it. I was enthralled with her soulfully smooth voice back when I was a kid.This collection features several selections from that album, but is an excellent overview of some of her finest work, including the Dolly Parton-Linda Ronstadt ""Trio"" days. ""Portraits"" contains some of my very favorite Emmylou tracks: ""Roses In The Snow"", ""Millworker"", ""Two More Bottles Of Wine"", ""Luxury Liner"", ""Save The Last Dance For Me"".Some of her best duet work is here, too, including her early work with Gram Parsons."
5,Celtic setting,I loved this addition. Ive always had a preference to adding celtic flair into my games and as such this suited my purposes great. If thats your thing then this will prove to be a good read and cause for inspiration.
3,"Fun, but the paint wears off.","My daughter really likes this truck, but she puts the man and the toy screwdriver in her mouth. This worries me because the paint has started to wear off. (She got it for Christmas, so it isn't old!)"
3,A DVD much like a night at the dive shop,"Every diver takes that time to sit around the shop and swap stories. This DVD is just that, without the shop and without your turn to share.The stories are very brief to a bit more than necessary in detail. Some are purely egocentric and some are the very thing which makes us love our hydo-addiction. I have watched it twice and it will probably sit on my shelf from now on. I think one place some of these stories would be useful is at a dive shop when people are curious about the sport, for a personal purchase, a night out with fellow divers is more useful.I did not buy it at full price but purchased a used copy. It was worth the used price but it is very pricey for a short DVD with limited production quality."
5,Very exciting book throughout,I'm an 12 year old girl that is making a project on this book for school. It is a very cool book. I didn't know how to spell Betty's full name so I came on the internet. What a good idea eh?
1,Downright useless.,"Seriously, folks -- your money is much better spent on ""Review for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork Certification"" by Joseph Ashton, Duke Cassel. (I reveiewed that one, too.) Moore's book is not even loosely organized -- it's a total hack-job. I have zero confidence in the accuracy of the material, and it's complete lack of organiztion and PAGES OF ADVERTISING are not conducive to actually learning or reviewing. My apologes to the tree that was cut down to make paper for it."
1,SO MUCH WRONG INFO! IT WILL CONFUSE YOU!!!,"I purchaced 2 books for review, mostly to help a tutor another classmate, as I am a nurse and felt confident without any review books. There were wrong answers and information on virtually every page. She uses the format of having people who have taken the test send in questions they remembered. Spelling was bad, they would include answer they gave...which was incorrect. After 30 pages of correcting and rechecking everything...I had enough!! I did use it to try and pick out Oriental questions...so I could research and fill in the blanks of charts I had created. But THIS BOOK IS BAD and for the student not clear on something would be fed alot of wrong information!!"
5,AWSOME theres nothing more to say!,"This is an amazing product. I mean who woulda' thought?? I have never waxed before and I barly know how to use tweezers i was nervous about using it on my virgin skin. but its just so amazing how this product works so well. Through the winter months I pretty much let my hair grow out, now that its gettin warm its to time be free! I used mooms for that. I had to trim my hair down before use and then yanked it off!so easy so affective so smooth n silky and smells great.... awsome"
1,I expected more,I am a fan of moom waxing system. I purchesed this thinking that it would have been useful while traveling. I was a little bit disappointed by this product. It does not work as the traditional moom.
5,One of my favorite strings,Out of all the different type of strings I've tried Phospher bronze is one of my favorite for aucustic use. They last longer for me as well as hold thier tuning longer. I also play the 12 string and they are what I prefer on it.
4,Great for beginners,"I got this for my Nephew who is 16 and wanted to try programming. This book was really good for him since he has had very little exposure to the ""behind the scenes"" of computers and software. He was able to write his first program right away which got him pretty excited about it."
4,Green Day Redux,"If you like Green Day, you have to get this CD! I mean, you don't have an option. This is the most killer thing to sit with your Green Day collection and to amaze your friends with. The must-have collector for real fans is The Network's Money Money 2020. I almost prefer it over Green Day's Insomniac, to be honest."
5,Great Album,"If you like Green Day or just rock music in general then get this CD. The music is punk/industrial with a very 80's futuristic sense to the lyrics, which are very often both funny and poignant. The songs are typically a criticism of pop culture, often with an emphasis on the over-sexualization of modern life. This is just a very fun CD to blast in your car and sing along to the ridiculous lyrics."
3,if you didn't know this... you are lame.,"ok come on people. green day is huge now and if you even try listen to the songs on this cd , you can tell is billie joe's voice. plus the fact that the first song is called joe robot... it all fits. if you ever thought this was some one else... you are wrong. if you don't belive me, go to the adeline record website and read their biography..."
1,"too much Devo, too little Green Day","How this CD keeps getting five star reviews I don't know. I love Green Day, tolerate Devo. Unfortunately for me, the ratio of Devo to Green Day was far too much in favor of the former. The songs, and I use that term loosely, are almost entirely devoid of any tune or melody and the lyrics are almost incomprehensible. The few moments where I could filter the Green Day guys out of the rest were pretty good, but out of 12 songs, that accounted for far too little time. Two of my favorite CD's are Green Day's ""Warning"" and ""Dookie"". But this CD, while definitely part Green Day is just too much Devo to enjoy."
2,Green Day had to be drunk to make this.,"I bought this CD because I heard it was Green Day and I love Green Day, my 2nd favorite band (1st-Foo Fighters). I was disappointed when I listened to it, it's mostly techno crap. If you like techno, good for you then buy the album. If you like rock and Green Day then buy another Green Day album if you don't have them all already. Don't waste your money unless you like techno. There's about 2 songs that are okay but the rest suck. The singer sounds a little like Billie Joe Armstrong, that's the only major similarity I found between the two bands. None of the songs sound like any of Green Day's songs (Green Day's songs are tremendously better). All of Green Day's albums are incredibly better especially Dookie, one of the greatest albums of all time. I don't think Green Day could make this crap unless they were drugged, drunk, or both."
1,Sucks,"This CD sucks and barely sounds anything like Green Day. Everything Green Day has ever written is a lot better. Green Day probably didn't want to ruin their reputation so they kept themselves secret when they made this, if they made this, I don't they could make something this bad. Differentenemy and joethomann are totally right about this CD. Don't waste your money on this garbage."
1,Listen if you must,"If you want to listen to '80's retreads then this CD is for you. If you want to remain a fan of Green Day then do not, under any circumstances, watch the included bonus DVD of a bunch of self-indulgent rich guys trying to be ""cool"". Painful and sad."
3,Billy Joe is that you?,"Yes, it is Billy Joe Armstrong from Green Day. This is a very different sound for Billy Joe. The songs are kind of Devo, Green Day, 80s keyboard rock. Very interesting and well worth checking out."
2,Hydro Thunder!,"Hydro Thunder is an awesome 3-D Racing game.But not just any racing game, but a water-boat one!!! It has SWEAT boats!Awesome levels!And has some Pretty darn good graphics!I play this game alot!!!!!!!!!!! it is a very good game."
1,Horrid Wii control options ruin a great series,"Classic games and motion control do not mix.I bought the Wii version of the MSA as it was cheaper than the PS2 version. I figured since there was a GC controller option, I could hook up my PS2 controller via my controller adapter. I was disappointed to find out the D-Pad does not work. And it wasn't because the adapter isn't compatible since I also tried hooking up a GC controller and using the D-Pad on that, and it turns out that the D-Pad is just not activated in GC controller mode. So the only way to play with a D-Pad is with the Wiimote, which would've been fine, except you have to shake it to throw a grenade. They didn't even give the option for the classic controller. I like using motion controls on Wii games meant for motion control. I like thumbsticks for 3D games. For classic 2D gaming, however, I prefer to keep the controls classic; with good ol'-fashioned D-Pad and buttons.I highly recommend Metal Slug Anthology; just not on the Wii."
5,Excellent Wii Platform Conversion,"I owned a NEO GEO in college and had several of the Metal Slug cartridges. The 7 games that come on this disc are perfect conversions of the original games with all the button-smashing and blood-spilling I remember. If a thrilling shoot-em-up game with no real story-line is what you're looking for, this is a great game, with great graphics, and great price for 7 different titles. It is especially fun with multiple people playing simultaneously, as you can destroy most of the scenery in each level. With the Wii, you can choose different controller configurations to make use of the Wii controller and nunchuck dexterity. I prefer the standard arrow keys and buttons, so the one thing I've had a hard time getting used to is that there aren't enough buttons to have one designated for bomb-throwing so you have to shake the Wii controller."
5,Wanna Blow Stuff Up?,"This is simple Old School nirvana! No complicated control schemes. No push the triangle and square button while hold Up and Left. Just shoot, jump, and run!Each game has ample doses of insane humor that adds to the inspired carnage. I was laughing and shooting all the way!The only downside is that I wanted more after finishing each game. Not necessarily the fault of the games, but I wanted more nutty situations to blast through.Definitely recommended if you have a cool friend (like my wife); the two player modes are the best way to go. No one wants to blow stuff up alone!"
3,Buy it for non-Wii consoles,"This game collection on a single disk is a winning lottery ticket for us Metal slug fans :) The only reason I rated it 3 stars is because I purchased the Wii version. The game play is not intuitive using Wii remote. First of all you have to hold the controller horizontally. While shooting, you are supposed to somehow jerk the controller if you want to throw a bomb. Whoever came up with the idea did not play the game on Wii :)I own a PS3 too and wish I had purchased the PS version. The D-Pad of PS3 is much more smoother and not as hard on my fingers.Get the PS version if you own the console."
3,Great Game for Retro Old Schoolers like me,"Although this game kept its original format in gameplay and its arcade graphics, the Wii version is not that great, as the credits are shared and not individually assigned to each player.Furthermore, in order to use the bombs or the cannon, you have to shake the wii controller, which can get annoying, since several scenes in the game play require it for you to pass them swiftly and shaking the remote while trying to control your character just doesn't cut it quite the same as the arcade version of the game, where there was no such thing as a wiimote.Aside from that you can place unlimited credits and beat every single game of the 7 included in the package, but it would be nicer to compete with a budy and use less credits than him just to show off.:)"
4,Liszt: Piano Works [Box Set],The cardboard containers in the box that contain each individual CD are too hard to get into. Would also have not included some of the works that were selected for the set.
2,Bad Binding,"This is a very good collection of Kant's practical writings, but I strongly advise against buying the hardcover edition. The binding is very poor quality and it will inevitably crack the moment you open the book (I exchanged my first copy after it broke, but the second did the same). In short, if you're going to buy this book, buy the paperback edition and don't waste your money on the hardcover edition. The paper is of better quality in the paperback, and you won't have spent three times as much money for a poorer quality book."
4,small,"This lantern is very small, but puts out a decent amount of light, but not enough really for a camp table. I recommend it for small uses (or emergencies)."
2,LED Lantern,"I thought it was poor quality compared to others I've seen / own.Damaged product didn't help my opinion of this item as well, but the seller was professional and efficient in the returning process and refund, so I cannot fault the seller but I would not recommend this product due to its cheapness and the LED's not functioning properly. Also, the light button is very weak and poorly made, making it hard to depress the light to activate it."
3,Prefer the Ballads More than Anything,"I bought this CD based on what customers said about it and because it contains one of the prettiest, heartfelt covers of a song I've ever heard: ""Hey Girl."" I can listen to this song over and over and still not get tired of it! Also like ""I Stand for You,"" ""I want you"" and ""Matters of the Heart."" The rest is just okay. A bit too...I don't know. I wanted more soulful, slow renditions. Maybe I'll try another CD."
3,A good starting point,"This video is a little bit outdated, however it can give a very good impression for those who wants to start a business with catle. this is not a video to teach someone, but rather a good starting point."
3,Panasonic BL-C131A network wireless camera 802.11,The camera is compact and attractive. Fairly easy to set up. The picture quality is fuzzy but good enough for the intended purpose. Controlling the camera via the internet works well. It takes more than one attempt to set the sensitivity so that you don't get bombarded with emails when motion is detected.
5,Love this camera!,Was very trying to set this camera up so I can view on the internet but K Lam and other reviews Helped so much!!!!It is now up and has been for over a month and I havent had a single problem.Well I did have trouble getting motion detection setup w my comcast mail but 2 calls to comcast and a chat with them solved that problem. I had the wrong port number for smtp.Love the camera controls so I can move it around the room and motion detection also works like a charm.Sound is Really good! almost too good ;)I bought this w the dlink 1130 which is also decent but this one is better with the extra features like moving the picture around the room. Lots of fun with the dogs!I haven't had any connection problems either. I have been able to go online at work and even on vacation to view the room with no issues!Here is the comcast information if anyone needs it:SMTP Server IP Address or Host Name: [...]port 587How to Authenticate:SMTPEnter Comcast email address and password
2,"Great while it works, great pain while it doesn't","I purchased the BL-C131A at a store, brought it home, and spent two to three hours trying to get it configured with a Mac. The options can be overwhelming and the web interface not so intuitive but you get all the features you'd expect for the price. The hardware is nice and heavy but the plastic shell feels a bit flimsy. Picture quality looked pretty good once I had it set up to simply ftp snapshots off-site when motion was detected.Two days after the return period ended (today) and the camera has stopped responding. I have yet to try resetting and reconfiguring (in the middle of dismantling the network for a move) but will update this review with the outcome."
2,Okay in full light...,"We bought our camera to monitor our toddler while he's in his room. I picked the Panasonic because it had a good reputation of not disconnecting, something a prior camera we had purchased had problems with. True enough, the connection was rock solid. And it's a quiet camera too, like a whisper. BUT... the image was heavily pixelated compared to other netcams, and it's absolutely horrible in low light. If you closed the shades in the room during the day, or tried to operate it at night with a small night light, you got a solid black screen. The image size on your computer is also very small compared to others I've seen. To add to the issues, the mounting bracket was a joke and there is no ability whatsoever for a ceiling mount - it's wall mount only. Finally, the range of scan was very limited. In the end, we returned this camera, mostly because of the pathetic performance in low light."
3,Wireless doesn't work well,"The whole reason why I bought these were to set up a wireless system around my house... I have yet to get the wireless portion to work any further than 5ft away from the router. Instead I've had to hardwire everything, which works great, but defeats the whole purpose of having wireless. Pan and tilt function is good, allowing you to move camera postion from a web browser... anywhere online! Bad low light res... if you want a night camera, don't get this one. All-in-all, if you're looking for something to keep an eye on things around the house, indoors... with the lights on, then this is a good camera to have."
2,no good FOR A MAC - can't see at work,"the product does work if you want to use it within your local WIFI. I couldn't for the life of me get the thing to work with me at work. I called apple, and Panasonic and at the end of the day - 4 calls later, I packed it up and sent it backif you are running a windows based computer - go for it. that is the only reason i gave it two starts - because on some level it must work great"
1,Doesn't work on WiFi,"Perhaps I just got a bad one, but after six hours of trying, I could never get it working on WiFi. Wired is fine. Not WiFi. Yet I have several other IP Cams (Toshiba, D-Link) plus many other devices (PC, MacBook, Nokia phone, several laptops, Nokia tablet, iPhone, etc) working on the wireless.Panasonic's support FAQ doesn't even have a single hit for the BL-C131A. But since I do this type of stuff every day, I either got a bad unit or they have some serious compatibility woes. Buyer beware."
5,BL C 131A - Great Product,"The product exceeded my expectations. It doesn't mention in the literature it's ability to buffer 150 + images (format dependant) to capture events that occur while the camera is not being actively monitored. This was a bonus. Setup was relatively easy but took 1.5 days ( not full time effort). For remote access to camera, user must know how to obtain own remote access IP address, possibly change settings on broadband modem etc. Not difficult but not explained in set up guide."
2,Has trouble with wireless security,"I've had this camera for over a year now and although I'm happy with the video monitoring performance I have a lot problems with it when I set up wireless security on my wireless router.If I set any type of wireless encryption on the router and set the camera to the same security it will not establish a connection.If I set up MAC address filtering on the router the camera will still not establish a connection.The only way I can use the router in wireless mode is to have a completely unsecured wireless network.I've updated the camera BIOS to no avail. I have other devices that connect flawlessly (laptops & Wii), but this camera is a no go.Not recommended if wireless security is important to you."
3,"Good camera, for 2004, but not anymore","After reading all of the glowing reviews, I had to try it out. I can understand why so many people loved it, 6-8 years ago, but there are several other cameras on the market now that offer better video quality for less money. The Foscam camera has much better video quality and offers all the same options, but sells for $90. I connected both cameras and viewed them on the same monitor at the same time, side by side. Hands down, the Foscam looked much better. This was very grainy compared to the Foscam."
2,Great... until you have to ftp or wait for Panasonic tech to call back,The BL-C131A netCam works pretty well and is easy to setup. There is no way to store video on the cam so you have to ftp your data to another drive. I chose a Seagate GoFlex FreeAgent 1TB network drive. Big Problem.... The Panasonic software will not allow an FTP destination to have a <space> in the path name which is fixed on the Seagate. I have called Panasonic and have yet to hear from them.
5,Works Great - Great Resolution,"I bought this camera based on all of the other good reviews, and it works great. I had a little difficulty getting the wireless figured out, but after reading through the documentation and fiddling with my router I was able to get it working. The key was making sure my Netgear Router had a port opened up to the outside world.Overall this is a solid product and has been good for me watching our new little puppy while we are away. It even works on the mobile phone!"
4,Good Camera,Easy to setup I have setup a few wireless devices and by fare this was the easiest to setup
2,"Nice picture, but poor reliability","We used this product to be able to check in on babies without opening the door and waking them. It worked well for this purpose, and the picture was pretty good and better than expected in low light. Two gripes with the product. First, the viewnetcam websites were unreliable, so checking in on the kids from work was hit or miss. Second, and more importantly, the products do not last. We've had two C131As, and both broke down after about 18 months. We didn't drop them or damage them in any way, they just stopeed working, and the warranty expired after 1 year."
3,Excellent camera but not user friendly!,"Picture quality is excellent for a camera that small and the mic is very sensitive that you. However, as a normal user it was impossible for me to configure it to my router.It was not the type of plug and play camera, I had to take it to an IT expert."
2,Not good enough for business,"This product is OK, if you only have one computer connected to your Modem ROUTER. If you have 2 or 3 computers connected to your Router for wireless connection. Then, you will have problem viewing it, it may required repeated resetting.I'm planning to have this replace soon. This product, I think works fine if you use it at home. [...]"
5,It works!,I have had this now for a couple of months and it has been working flawlessly. I had to call customer support because it would not work in Firefox and the support was excellent ...
4,Assembly required,"Did not find an easy way to initialize the camera using Apples' OSX within the two hours I had to set up the product. That makes a two-star on the ease of use. Low light performance is not good (7AM on a winter day in room in Chicago makes an impossible to view dark recording), which makes it 4-star overall for features. Network connectivity on a LAN is a snap, works seamlessly with Synology DSM 2.2. I did not test the WAN connectivity."
4,Worth the Money,"Bought one, am buying another and now my friends are buying them. You get what you pay for. Panasonic has better quality cameras but this is made for the general user/Harry homeowner. Keep in mind you will need patience to set it up wireless. Calling Tech support is a must(for me.) Best to just call them before start fiddling with it, unless you are a network person. Quality is okay, no crashes, stable, love the ability to forward images to email address when motion is detected. That way in case the camera is stolen or broken, you got the images in your inbox. For the price, it is a no brainer. Just buy it you won't be sorry. But remember, you may have to spend some time setting it up with the help of tech support."
4,Panasonic BL-C131A,"Overall good product, would purchase another. Offers dual-axis control for a much lower price then its competitors. Internet cameras in general have very small image sensors, this leads to poor image quality compared to other digital cameras, the BL-C131A is no different. The on-board camera software offers very fine control however documentation is very poor and it is basically a trial and error process when setting up advanced features."
5,BL-C131A: Excellent in all respects..,"Excellent product.Does everything that is documented.Rock-solid stability. Been up and running for the past two months since it was setup.If there is one regret, I only wish it had optical zoom.But, for the price, it is the best in the market today."
5,Works Great!,"After reading the literature that came along with the camera, I had it successfully on the web in about 30 minutes. My friends and family (I give an account to) can now go to a free web address and log in to view our backyard where the deer play! Once online it is very easy to control the direction of the camera and multiple people can view it at one time."
2,Good when it worked,"I had this camera for almost 2 years.It worked Ok until two weeks ago when the front LED started flashing red.Call to Panasonic technical support did not help - the camera needs to be sent back for repair.Just the labor is about half of what I paid for the camera, which makes the repair option meaningless.The camera was never abused and was at the same place all that time (in a room next to glass window)."
4,Good for Mac - although not intuitive to set up,"I bought this camera through ebay and got a good deal ([...]refurbished but looks and works fine) to use for my home weather station. The setup was a bit difficult for my Mac (2007 imac) because the enclosed software is PC only. It is also strange that the only way to set it up is via an ethernet cable, even though it is a wireless camera. After a few calls to Panasonic (very minimal wait time and intelligent and helpful staff - WAY TO GO PANASONIC!!!) I am up and running with all of the features. The camera looks and works great - [...].The network server and ftp feature work fine with my weather station ([...]) and I am now online and able to see my yard from anywhere with an internet connection - I still haven't figured out how to get the picture using a cellphone, but it is supposedly possible."
4,Doesn't work if there is a firewall on the computer,"Overall, this camera is a good buy. We had tried a Linksys camera before and everything everyone says about Linksys is true. Bad idea. This panasonic camera was easy to set up, about 2 hours with a call to technical support. Techinical support is excellent by the way. The only downside to this camera is a little bit of false advertising: it says you can access it from anywhere in the world. There are many computers I have not been able to access it from due to some type of firewall. It seems like it only works on personal computers, not public computers like at the public library or at work."
2,Complex setup and poor image,"If this is the best, as other reviews claim, I would not want to experience the others. The system works and has lots of features but it has too big flaws. The first is, as others have said, setup is complex and you will likely need tech support - it took about a half hour going thru various router settings etc to get this thing to work. And if I ever change my router I'll have to go thru that again. This is about as far from plug and play as you can get. But my main gripe is image quality. At 640 x 480 (decades old resolution) the image is very grainy and fuzzy - probably about what you might expect from a $19.95 keychain digicam, or worse. Maybe I'm spoiled in owning a modern digicam but it must be possible to do better than this. The lens appears to be a pinhole - I'm not sure there is any lens at all."
2,Overrated Camera,Tried to do what others have done on this camera and I purchased it because I am on a Mac operating system. This camera failed to work well on my system. It states this on the website I visited to complete the set up process (since it doesn't have any instructions that worked). You will need to call a technician to complete the camera to function.
3,"Great, but overpriced and kicked just after warranty","I bought this camera a little over a year ago, as I work from home and like to be able to see whats going on outside everytime my dog starts barking and I dont want to get up each time to see whats up.For that purpose, it has been ideal. With the PTZ I can look all the way up and down my street from the second-story window. Frame rate, low light performance and resolution are all great.Unfortunately, just after the warranty expired (just one year), the picture went all screwy. Its still usable but its blurry. I contacted Panasonic for support and they let me know it was out of warranty but could be repaired.This camera really needs to come down to $149. Unfortunately not alot of manufacturers are competing with Panasonic in this class to create the pricing pressure."
1,Unreliable,"We have two cameras connected through a wireless router, in a very small house - they are both very close to the router. They are completely unrealiable. They will work one day and not the next. It's extremely aggrivating."
2,"You'd better be computer ""savy""to get this camera on the net!!","I've had nothing but ""headaches""trying to get this camera to work wirelessly.Integrating the camera with my (linksys WRT160Nv2) router was a challenge,but the camera is running ""wired""without problems.Following the directions explicitly,has'nt got me any closer to operating the camera wirelessly yet!!I guess I'm going wired.Facts an questions on the Panasonics web page has'nt been any help either!NOT A HAPPY CAMPER!!!I would not recommend this unit to anyone!!"
5,My doggy webcam,I love my panasonic webcam once I got it going. I'm not a computer savy person but I was able to hook it up on my own with the help of Panasonic customer service. I love the range that the camera lens can move around. I angled the camera where I can see my whole living room/dining room/kitchen area and my patio area where my dog spend most of her time. I love the fact that I can watch her over the internet while I'm at work. I recommend this product to anyone.
1,Died After A Couple Years for No Reason - JUNK,"Had this camera for a few years. Setup is ALWAYS a pain in the butt. No matter what or where. Quality of the image is poor. Support folks have odd ways of ""helping"". Now, after a few years, something seems to have failed inside even though it says it's working fine.Complete e-trash! BUYER BEWARE!!!Panasonic support wants it to be sent in. They have no idea, but obviously it's an ongoing issue - see other reviews with the exact same error code. Something tells me this is Panasonic's way to adding more money."
3,Good functions; stops working quickly,"There are many excellent functions with this camera. I bought 2 of them and one stopped working after about a year and the second about 6 months later. They would randomly loose connection with the wireless router and go to a blinking red light. In the troubleshooting manual, it says a blinking red light can only be fixed by the authorized servicer. It is not worth the money for it to work only for about a year."
3,"Cool camera, retarded customer service!!","I have spent all day working on getting this camera working, 99% of the time has been waiting on hold and trying to get through to the wrong person at Panasonic, finally got ahold of someone and figured it all out. Panasonic needs to do a better job of routing the calls and getting the customer service out to the customer. This camera IMO requires customer service to setup. Once it is setup though it is slick. Only thing I am dissapointed on is the CS that I was given by Panasonic, many reviews called it very good, I would call it frustrating at the best."
4,"Hard to set up multiple cams, but great once you have","Ok. I am better than the average bear at computers, but having multiple ones in y house created a problem. It took forever to set these up and had to have a friend do it for us.However, these cameras are great. The picture and sounds quality in nice. I bought these for home survelliance to watch my twins and my nanny and I am pleased.I also own a Motorola Droid and am searcing for apps to let me stream the webcams to my phone. Right now I can only view stationary images, but hope to resolve this soon.Overall, great cameras at a great price. I would buy them again."
3,Good Camera. Expensive software.,"I purchased four of these cameras and found out that the recording software included with it comes with a license to record only one camera. If you want to record more than one camera, you have to purchase an upgraded version with additional licenses and that lists for $399 and Amazon has it for $315.03 + ShippingNetwork Camera SoftwareIf you are purchasing more than one camera for Surveillance purpose, make sure to take in to account of the additional costs."
5,Good Webcam but Great Tech Support,"I bought one of these to monior my house while on vacation. The reviews suggested that it was the best for the price. The set up was also supposed to be the easiest of the lot and it turned out to be relatively simple until I got to the internet set up. Using a Mac with a Time Capsule router was not the ""easy as pie"" operation that I had hoped for. It was more like French torte with cream and chocolate sauce. I began gathering the packing material for a return, and made the cursory call to tech support. I've never had good phone tech and did not expect anything different this time. I was wrong. Best ever. The guy walked me through the not-too-obvious steps and within less than an hour was up and running. The phone tech was worth the price of the product itself!"
5,"Everyone should have one, here are some tips","I love everything about this little cam. If I could make it more ""perfect"" I'd give it a mechanical IR cutoff filter so that it could work it complete darkness using IR LEDs. Outdoors, this can see in dim light until about an hour after sunset. Even though the cam says it is for indoor use only, I've had it mounted under a sheltered roof eave working fine for the past 6 months. Another one in the outdoor hallway at my brother's house is subject to -20C temps and still keeps going. So it seems OK outdoors as long as it doesn't get wet. You can download a very useful Windows Vista Sidebar gadget to display the live cam images on the Vista desktop. Go to the Windows Live Gallery and search for Panasonic. With this gadget I have a bird's eye peripheral view on the desktop. It's great to bring the outside world inside."
1,Network cam,Not too reliable. I can't keep the web based access working even with an auto restart everyday. I have to restart this camera about 2 a day to keep the web based access working. The local access works fine.
2,Wait till it drops below 150.00,"Bought this from NewEgg for 259.Image quality is 640x480, it does not have zoom, andalthough has a nice interface via a browser and hassoftware, it's kind of simple, if you don't care aboutpicture quality or zoom then i guess its ok, but itsworth more like 100-150 for it's limited feature.It being wireless is the major nice feature other thanthat I don't it its worth the money."
1,customer support,"I thought I'd call the support line to see how fast the response is....20 mn and still waiting on the 800-272-7033...anyone have the ""BatPhone"" number? 800-211-7262 doesn't seem any better.G2"
5,Network Camera,Arrived on time and well packaged. Not connected yet but I assume it will work as flawlessly as the others that I have.
3,Image resolution....needed to be enhanced,"Well, I bought this because my camcorder had a problem at functioning web-cam.Cam-corder is panasonic.(Good)This net-cam, no good resolution image as much as cam corder."
1,Hardware was hard to configure,"I tried twice to install this item, after having to disable my McAfee fire wall the install process proceded, then the page for the wireless set up would not come up (site error), I tried to go back and it lost the camera in the list, the camera search and wouldn't find the camera again.I tried turning off the camera and restarting, no good.This week I was able to link my new XBox 360 to my PC which was mildly difficut. I have always been able to complete these types of installs.The Panasonic Camera was far more difficult.PS;This camera is for indoors only, your not supposed to view a sceen from behind glass (looking outside) It needs a certain type of router setting,My Fios gateway(router) may have been the problem which for me is not exchangeable. (At least Verizon says not 2)"
3,"Panasonic Network Camera is OKAY, Software is not so great!","The Panasonic Camera for the price is OKAY. However, the other reviews I read convinced me to buy one. I believed it would be easy as PIE. The software did NOT work well and I found out you need an IP address to access the camera on the web. I use Bellsouth DSL and it did not work with it. Panasonic's tech support I could not say enough about, they were GREAT. The software for the computer still is NOT working, they really could use some updating. Learned a lot about PORT FORWARDING, etc. I do not believe I would buy a second one. Also, the camera will stop recording after so long being idle. And once the camera is full of video it stops recording. Guess I was expecting a lot more. Also, I tried saving the video and it will not save it, I have to copy each picture I want to save. It gives you the option but it does not work, and I use Microsoft's Vista."
5,Wireless network Camera,Great device. Easy to set-up and use. I would definitely recommend it to others.
2,How Stuff Works,"I was disappointed with this book because there were so few pictutres and they were small on the page and not even on every page. The print is too small for a young person. I would like to have known thee things before I ordered the book. It just was not as attractive to a young boy as the other book I ordered. I wanted this book for one of our grandchildren, age 9, but did not give it to him. In, fact, I would like to return it and exchange it for the other book I ordered, The New Way Things Work. So, I am wondering if I could get a postage free return label from you? Hopefully I can get the other book postage free too. Thanks. I would like to continue using Amazon to order items. LaVonne"
5,Business Objects: The Complete Reference,"I have not gotten through the entire book yet but so far it has addressed all my needes. I found it to be more than just a reference manual. It takes you through eash aspect of the product in a fair amount of detail. It also give you best practices, the kind of thing I would hope to get in classroom instruction."
2,A real Time Killer - - - No Meat and all gravy,"I have to say I was really excited when I picked up this book but now that I am almost through the book ...... I wonder how the hell did I have to patience to read the entire book without tossing it into the bin ..... well may be I wanted to to get something out of it for my money's worth ..... This book is not bad its just not what you would expect from the complete refrence series .... ABSOLUTELY NO MEAT ..... hell I could have written a book by copying and modifying the language from the USER Manuals ........ You don't learn something when the author just tells you ""OK drop this menu and select this option"" unless you are going to tell me why am I selecting this option ..... sry but I have to be harsh on this .... when you are writing a book a such a good software you need to be in really top form with an excellent command on everything ........ In the end ""READ THIS IF YOUR COMPANY BUYS IT FOR YOU AND DON""T SPEND MRE THAN 2 DAYS ON THIS"""
3,Not Bad,This bag is nice and big and has a lot of pockets.The problem I had was with the zipper.The zipper started sticking on the 3rd day I had it.I think it might have been a product defect.I could have just gotten a bad one.
4,"Quite a talent, but not what I expected","I was looking for traditional Romanian music when I bought this CD. Muzur certainly is a master fiddler, and the music is distinctly Romanian in style and presentation, but it's not ""traditional"" or ""folk,"" as I had expected. It's more akin to the Romanian version of the Turtle Island String Quartet: Muzur and other talented Romanian musicians start from a culturally-based common ground, and do all sorts of interesting (and sometimes humorous) new things based on old ideas.If you're not afraid to hear something new, this is kind of interesting. If you're looking for traditional ""folk"" Romanian music, this isn't it."
3,"fascinating mix of native american, cowboy, and folk music","almost an ecclectic gathering of native american, folk, and cowboy music. From ""Tumbleweed's"" almost cowboy-like meter to the poignancy of ""Many Trails"", this artist will engage your thoughts about the the life of the Native American as well as your own."
3,"Beware, this CD comes with different covers","This CD has been released with two completely different art covers, one shown and another completely different colored cover and picture. Good CD just make sure you don't mistakenly buy the same CD twice like I did."
5,OWN THIS CD!,THE RED ROAD A GREAT CD THIS IS A REQUIREMENT TO GO INTO YOUR NATIVE COLLECTION OR TO START ONE IT WILL BE ONE OF YOUR FAVORATES.........
5,Bill Miller's best opus... deserves 6 stars ! ! !,"""the red road"" is the kind of cd that you can listen for ever without never getting bored... ""reservation road"",""tumbleweed"",""faith of a child"" are probably the three best songs ever written by Bill miller... the arrangements are simple but beautiful, the sound is incredible (especially on the instrumental track 1). if you like folk music and acoustic guitar, this cd is for you, it's worth it !"
5,Faith Of A Child...,"What a wonderful song, on a truly great CD. Gives me chills evertime I listen to it. Bill Miller's songs really touch your soul."
5,"Cam Pyle,Joel Cooper Rock this Album is Amazing and shows some of Cam Pyles Humor and amazing Guitar Work",Great CD Hard Rock with a little Humor for good measure some of Cam Pyles amazing Fret Work . This CD reminds Me just How Good Amos Moses was . Cam had a lot of Hair back then.I recomend this if you like Rock and Roll
1,It's a DOG!,"Anyone who has been captivated by the minimal spaciousness and poise of Part's other releases should think twice before purchasing this turkey. The compositions (only two of them, but recycled several times by Manfred Eicher in this pre-Christmas cash-in on the composer's celebrity) date back to the seventies when Part was still germinating his true style. They are tedious in the extreme, lacking the harmonic depth and thematic development that characterise his more listenable works. Newcomers to Arvo Part's world would do far better to check out Te Deum or Kanon Pokajanen."
1,What is the emperor wearing?,"I like the works of Part, not for concert listening but as background music for creating an ambiance. I frequently play his music when doing yoga in the mornings. But this album goes much to far in the direction of minimalism for my taste. The music is childishly simple and repetitive. The marketing department compounds the insult with extra layers of packaging, and by filling a CD with nearly-identical performances of the same two works."
5,Purely Sublime,"Achingly sweet. When I first heard the opening notes of Spiegel im Speigel I really could not listen to it right then and there. I turned it off because I was simply not ready; that song was unlike any other classical piece and it demanded almost total surrender. I could tell that something really special was coming along in staggering, almost fragile simplicity. I've learned that one almost has to prepare himself in order to receive in full the particular delight it brings. To me it (together with Fur Alina, the only other song on the disc) stands alone of one of the most hauningly beautiful melodies I've ever heard."
5,if i could make paintings this good,more than any other cd in the last ten years this one has been the sound garden for my workthank you Mr. Pärt
4,Music for the inner ear,"Program notes reveal that composer's instruction remark for playing Für Alina read ""Calm, exalted, listening to one's inner self"". The same words, seems to me, could be used to describe the entire CD. Beautiful, ethereal music turning melancholy into serenity. ""Spiritual"" is the word often heard in relation to Pärt's work. ECM's customary transparent and crystal-clear recording brings out all details proving that instruments too - and not only musicians - breathe. The differences in repeated renditions of the two compositions sound too subtle to me at this time (the CD is my recent acquisition), especially in two violin & piano versions of Spiegel im Spiegel, but hopefully I will learn to appreciate them more in time."
3,"Good, but I should probably have picked another Pärt disk","Before buying this disk I had one other disk of Pärt's music. And I hear a bunch of Pärt on Q2 ([...], a great source of--as they used to promote themselves--""new music from the last 500 years"") but I didn't take the time to look back at Q2's play list to see which ones I actually heard and liked before ordering this disk, which turns out to be a little too dull for my taste. Not a tragedy, but next time I'll be more careful."
5,Takes getting used to...but well worth it,"By all means an unconventional CD - 5 tracks, but 2 pieces. Spiegel Im Spiegel is heard on tracks 1,3 and 5 (violin/piano on 1 and 5, cello/piano on 3), Fur Alina (solo piano) is on tracks 2 and 4. Theses pieces are marked by a simple austere beauty. There is no virtuosity on this album - simply glorious sound. However, the cyclical nature of this album may take some people some getting used to. However, Part makes a beautiful comment about humanity with this sort of arrangement, and anybody who thinks that this is a bad album (see some reviews below) completely missed the point."
4,"This music was featured in HBO's ""Wit"": Beautiful","I finally tracked down this music. It was the score behind the final scene in ""Wit"" with Emma Thompson that recently aired on HBO.The barely audible crecendos of the Speigel im Speigel pieces are transcendent: just a tiny act can mean so much if you pay attention and notice.I have to say I'm less fond of the piano works--a little too Windham Hill for my taste. But the other pieces are terribly moving and well worth having in any collection."
5,"Listen, this could change your life.","This is such a thing of beauty, I cannot say much other than this. Prepare a space, and a time. Sit quietly and listen to this. You may cry, you may sing, but one thing is certain, you will not be unmoved."
2,Difficult to install,"Spotty instructions made this difficult for me to properly install. Granted, I'm not an IT guy, but I am pretty handy with computer gadgets and have NEVER tossed something on a shelf and given up before.It'll wait now for our outside services IT guy's next visit to get installed."
4,Not too bad,"This is a pretty good screen. The panels are velcroed fabric, so easy to clean and or change. The one compaint is, the feet are not very big, so it can be a bit tippy. We have it against railing, with a flower pot, which is fine, but for free standing, a small wind will knock it over."
2,duped peice of crap,don't like very much because the game was not made by the orginal company it was duped and you can't even jump the boats or get a super start off the line this product really sucks i will not buy again i don't like being tricked into thinking that something is just used not duped!!! find some way to insure that the product is what it is suposed to be !! freeman caldwell
3,Great rendition but INFERIOR to the John Morgan Reconstruction (w/MSO),"I like this rendition of Steiner's classic score. It was the best up until John Morgan completely reconstructed the entire score and put the heart and soul into it that has Steiner smiling from up above. Therefore, I say forego this version and shoot for Morgan's (with the Moscow Symphony Orchestra).Most noticeable: this ""Jungle Dance"" is lacking and sloppy. It doesn't provide the impact or power of the original score and has always bugged me. When you listen to Morgan's version, you'll love it and think, Yeah, that's it. that's the ticket!Here's the link on amazon: http://www.amazon.com/King-Kong-Complete-1933-Score/dp/B0007ACVK0"
2,Chilton's Ford:Aspire 1994-98 Repair Manual (Chilton's total,"It looks so easy! The instructions in this Chilton manual read like directions to your buddy's fishing hole; don't worry, you can't miss it! And, like the four wheel drive it takes to get lost on the way to the ""Big One's"" home, this book simply allows the mechanic to go far enough to get into real trouble. Perhaps the easy stuff is. But for what we got it for, changing the timing belt, the instructions were decpetively misleading. Change your own oil if you must, but take the timing belt to the garage rather than buy this book."
5,Ford Aspire car care manual,We have been looking for a manual for our ford aspire. The parts for this car is hard to find and when we take it to the shops it is very expensive because they have to make parts for this car. Now we can fix it ourselves and pick up parts from salvage yards. This item was shipped very quickly.
4,"Very good, as far as it goes.","As far as it goes, this is a wonderful box set, containing most of Stravinsky's major works in excellent performances and sound. Although Stravinsky and Ansermet had a falling out over the interpretation of some works, Ansermet was a superb interpreter of the Russian composer's music, especially the ballets. Ansermet never recorded the opera, ""The Rake's Progress,"" so of course that's not represented. However, I'm very disappointed that his old Decca recording of the oratorio ""Oedipus Rex"" with Ernest Haefliger, Helene Bouvier, and (I think) Heinz Rehfuss is not here. It certainly falls within the realm of ""stage works,"" so it should have been included."
3,they work,ok. this is crazy writing a long review. they are banjo strings and they work. bravo! four more words needed
2,Thin 3rd string,"I've had these on my banjo for 24 hours now, so enough time to ""settle in"" a bit. I absolutely hate the thin 3rd (.013) string. It feels flabby, and sounds really weak. Not only that, but it vibrates so wildly (due to being so loose) that it actually goes out of tune for a second after you strike it, returning to proper pitch only if you wait. But then, in banjo playing, you strike the strings wildly, so it never even has the chance to return to the proper pitch.I'm going to give them another day or two to see if they settle in any more, but chances are I'll be swapping them out sooner rather than later."
5,Great Book from an exciting new writer!,"Finally a new writer with a Clancy flare!This book was recommended to me by a friend. I couldn't find it in stores due to it just being released. I ordered it on line.I now must thank my friend for the recommendation. It was a thrill ride from the first page to the end. I hear that the writer is working on the second book, which will be a continuation of this one. I can't wait!!!If you like a fast read with a real story that will grab you and not turn you loose, I strongly suggest ""Out of the Blue: Book One of Project Infinity,"" by Tom Inabnet.Enjoy!!!"
4,B.B. King Twofer,"Actually, the first 10 tracks on this MCA cd reissue are the lp ""Blues N Jazz."" This was recorded in 1983 and indeed contains some brassy blues, almost a return to his blues foundations after B.B.'s previous flirtations with funk and soul. The next 10 tracks were originally issued as the lp ""His Best - The Electric B.B. King."" These are songs recorded between 1965 and 68 and include some real gems. There is an excellent live version of ""Sweet 16"" from the same late 1966 session issued as ""Blues is King."" Some consider that lp as greater than the far more famous ""Live at the Regal."" This track, not included in the original lp or cd reisse of ""Blues is King,"" is a definite highlight. Other great cuts include: ""Paying the Cost to Be the Boss,"" ""Don't Answer the Door,"" ""Think it Over,"" and ""Don't Want You Cutting Your Hair."" Good Stuff."
4,Great Help!,I used this book for science project research. I found it tremendously helpful although in some places a little hard to follow for a high schooler.
1,Don't waste your money!,"What a joke! Raw and uncensored? Maybe the language used but definitely not in the visual aspect. Face it, the only people interested in this dvd are looking for softcore of Julie Strain and Julie K Smith and this in NO way delivers. An hour long photoshoot with no nudity. If you buy this dvd, don't pay more than $1.00. This video deserves ZERO stars!! That's my warning to you and I'm sticking to it."
4,Note from a friend about this book,"provides some history of the Birmingham > school and goes on to summarize the influences of Saussure, Lévi-Strauss, > Barthes, Derrida, Lacan, Foucault, Althusser. It also provides summaries > of Marxism, the Frankfurt School, Feminism, & Postmodernism. --from a friend''s letter."
5,"Turbo Jam, party mix 2","I really like the turbo jam workouts....the music IS great. I'm 46 years old....and the music is what really motivates you...well, along with Charlene, of coarse! Can't wait to try the live workout!"
3,No How to,"The workout itself is pretty good. Lots of kicks and it gets your blood pumping pretty quickly however, do not buy this if you have not tried any of the turbo jam videos before. There are no instructions available on how to do the moves. She just goes right into the timed workout. It is kind of disappointing, as it took me a while to make sure I was doing them correctly."
4,Vigorous exercise - and lots of fun,"I really liked Turbo Jam 1 and got this just in order to have some variety. But it's as if they took all the most fun moves and combined them here, so I enjoy this one quite a lot more. You really work up a sweat - it's genuine exercise - and I love the variety and the music. The time segments are just long enough so they carry you smoothly through the routine and you don't get bored. My only complaint is that Chalene is quite inept with her verbal cuing about what move is coming next - so you basically have to memorize the routine in order to avoid confusion. When she does the cuing right, like one musical measure before the change of step, it is great because you can truly relax into what you are doing. But at least half the time she announces the change right as it's happening, or even a bit after the fact. Irritating! But I do recommend the DVD."
5,Exact and excellent,This book is exactly what I had hoped it would be and is instrumental in my bible study. Thank you.
4,Vine's Complete Exp Dictionary,Vine's Complete Exp Dictionary of Old and New Testament words is really an asset to Biblical studies. Thank you for making this available on-line.
5,Pleased,"I received my package today and was surprised it was so well packaged! It came in a box with packing peanuts, was wrapped with padded paper, and then by another layer of paper and cardboard. The book was also in like new condition as advertised. It's clear that Pastor Rich really values his books and takes great care of them!"
4,The Valuable Vine's,"I am even more satisfied with 'Vine's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words' than I expected I would be. There is certainly much insight to be gained by word studies.Being a new author, I have found this book to very useful and I am sure to use it as a handy reference for other books that I plan to write. Although my book is not quite finished, 'Vine's' has definitely given my memory and my notes a fresh perspective on The Word."
3,"not complete, never there when it counts","I'm sure this is great for some people, but I've owned this one for a while and it has *never* come in handy because it doesn't have every word in it. Usually the word you want to do a study on is something rare. Even worse are the times when I've checked the English word index and it says ""Ya, check out pages such and such"" and I do to find nothing there of any relevance. I think this is a better decoration than it is a tool, especially considering how much is available for free online. Save your cash."
1,unhappy buyer,"I had ordered a book from indoobestsellers titled Vines Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words. It took two weeks for me to receive a package from them and when I did it was the wrong item. I notified them of this and there reply was to send back the product at my cost and them they would send the correct product. This is a poor way to do business. They make a mistake and I am the one inconvenienced and it cost me more money. Most businesses want to keep customers satisfied, and I am definitely not satisfied."
3,Expository,This one isnt what i tought it would be. It is OK . for what it is. Leaves out some what i would have thought would be in it . Difficult at times but it is what it is .
2,"Old standard, now surpassed","I hate to give this dictionary only 2 stars because it has been the most helpful word study tool for those who do not know the original Biblical languages. But it has now been surpassed byMounce's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words (William Mounce).It is more accurate and thorough than Vine's.Stephen D. Renn's Expository Dictionary of Bible Words and Lawrence Richards' New International Encyclopedia of Bible Words can also be helpful. But they are less thorough than Vine's, let alone Mounce's.Other helpful tools for word study include:Interlinear for the Rest of Us (William Mounce), which includes a Greek-English dictionary.Word Study Greek-English New Testament (Paul McReynolds), which has a very useful concordance based on Greek words."
4,Vine's...,"I purchased this for someone, but I have one, and it's a keeper for the library. I would recommend this to anyone."
3,We use for Bible Study.,"My husband and I use for our Bible Study. It has been a great help, took us awhile to find how to use it."
4,VINES COMPLETE EXPOSITORY DICTIONARY,This book is a great tool for those willing to research particular words and meanings of Bible lexicon. It teaches how the same word is used [noun/verb] and how this affects its meaning in the scriptures. A great addition to any library!
4,"game good, disc sent not so good","the game itself is great. the disc was sent with a major crack in the center of the disc, which has caused some problems, but it still plays alright 95% of the time."
4,Realy Goods Game!,"Draconnus is a real very fun game.I loved Metal Gear Sold for PS_X and Draconnus is differant byt almosst as fun play. My favorit part of the gae fighting gobblins&trolls! You swing sword as guy fightier or girl with big sword magics &shield. Enemay AIS is tricky! They got behind me and attacks easy! Leevls was big& Took a long time formapping to figrue out where to go but it was fun to run aruond in. and kill enemays is excitig! IF you want draemCast game this one shoud save moenys and buy game for playing fun,I did and have fun!"
4,Beautiful sheets,"These sheets are beautiful - the colors are as they look - chocolate brown with shades of a sky blue. The reason I gave them 4 stars is because they are on the thin side. This doesn't bother me because I like thin sheets in the summer. But, they may not last as long as some of the thicker ones out there. A little pricey considering they are so thin but worth the cost because they are so nice looking."
5,Beautiful,My children love the beautiful illustrations and the touching story. The story is a wonderful tool for talking about the topic of adoption on a level that is appropriate for young children. I would recommend this book for any family that has adopted or for families who have friends who have adopted.
3,Poignant and Relevant,"I could not believe how similar our adoption experience was to that portrayed here. Beautiful artistry and very sweet. Airplane on the front cover really sold my daughter and us from the start. Somehow that airplane ride home, though excrutiatingly painful at the time, will always speak volumes to my child about how important she is to us. How can you put the international adoption experience in a book? This author did a fantastic job of capturing the high points that relate to every Russian adoption."
5,Great for explaining adoption to a three-year-old,"I love this book. The drawings are beautiful, and the story is heart-warming. It is helping explain adoption to my three-year-old Russian daughter while we wait to bring her baby brother home from Russia."
5,A Beautiful Story,"This tale of a Russian adoption is a favorite bedtime story for my little girl. She often refers to it as ""her story"". The book portrays the process for meeting your child with the simplicity and love that a child can understand. It also does a great job of showing there are two sides to the stoy-that of the adopted child and that of her parents. This one goes in our forever pile."
5,beautiful and moving story,As a person who works with adopted children and their parents I highly recommend this book. The illustrations are beautiful and the story is really moving. I think that it can be both a general adoption story that could start a discussion on life before the adoption and a russian adoption story. Highly Recommended!
3,Disappointing,"I felt that the message of the book (in words and pictures) was essentially, ""Your life didn't begin until we adopted you."" This isn't the message we want for our daughter and were disappointed with the book. While the author did include some Russian vocabulary, I found little balance of American and Russian culture. I loved the premise of the book but didn't care for the book. Obviously, this is the adoption story of the author's daughter - not anyone else's. All adoption stories are unique."
1,Propaganda,"I was horrified by this book. I thought the portrayal of the birth mother as a colorless, shadowy figure could be frightening for a young child. And the message seems to be, ""your country and heritage and blood relatives are drab, unloving and inferior. You sure are lucky we adopted you."""
3,Bootstrap,"Bootstrap is an interesting read. It was recommended to me. This book is only really intended for people who are looking to start a business, and the author is fairly transparent about everything which is helpful. It is not a how-to guide, it is the story of the author's creation of a business, how they managed it, and how they sold it, with all their feelings interleaved."
5,Strongly recommended reading for all entrepreneurs,"Kenneth Hess was the founder and President of Banner Blue Software which he took from a raw ""bootstrap"" startup and build it into an established company with a multimillion dollar annual sales record. Bootstrap: Lessons Learned Building A Successful Company From Scratch is the author's true story of successfully creating his viable business from scratch. Filled with risks, rewards, lessons learned the hard way and the fruits of up-close and personal inspiration, Bootstrap is an inspiring read filled with the wisdom that comes from earned experience. Strongly recommended reading for all entrepreneurs aspiring towards achieving corporate success with their own business enterprises, regardless of services furnished or products produced."
2,Interesting but not particularly educational,"An interesting book that would have been more useful had it delved into some of the 'mistakes' a bit more. Hess makes it all sound so simple, a straight, clear path that was always obvious to him. Any mistakes (like new products started and abandonded) are dealt with in a very cursory way. As the owner of a bootstrap software company I was hoping for more insight and to learn a thing or two. I was entertained (athough slightly irritated by some of it) but would not really recommend it other than as a bit of light reading. I bought this book because of the rave reviews on the Amazon site, but would have to say that overall I was disappointed. All those people who provided 5 star reviews clearly need to get out a bit more and read something of substance for a change!"
5,Great inspirational story for anyone thinking of starting a company,"The 10 year story of starting a company scratch with no outside money, and taking it to US$17/million annual revenue and 80 employees over the span of 10 years.Lots of great advice for any owner-CEO, especially in the high-tech software field.A page turner for anyone thinking of starting a high-tech software company (me), or working on high-tech marketing or product development."
3,The last song is the best,While it is not my favorite style of Christian music it is well done and her voice is lovely. The words of the last song are spectacular.
2,Not to My Taste,I guess one has to like this kind of dissonant interpretation of simply beautiful music innately. I got a headache before finishing the disc. Music is indeed very personal.
1,Not really 'push up',"When they arrived in the mail and I pulled them out of the package, I found these little tiny things! Despite their size, I figured because I was small they might still do the trick. Not so much! I tucked them into my bra and they did no lifting whatsoever and I'm barely a B-cup! Then I figured that I might be able to tuck them into the little pockets of my bikinis to make me look fuller. They fit into the pockets, but you can clearly tell that they are in there and it looks ridiculous! I'm not really sure what to use them for now...I was trying to save money and refused to spend $50 on another product, but I probably should have just made the splurge because now I've wasted money."
3,5 ancestors series,These books are great fun. the move very fast with great action.I have read all of them and do not know how many books the series will have and i do not like this! The web site does not have it and the books read very fast so now I am waiting for Mouse but starting to tire of this.B
4,Great and politically correct,"Frankie Beverly has proven to be one of the world's great soul musicians as Maze has always been the masters of soul music. The Song ""In Time"", I think is one of the best peace song in the world today. If all politicians of this world were to listen to this song, the world would be a better place today. Yes, In Time, we can make this planet a parade."
1,"What review, never recieved it.","The product was order through the Amazon Market place. The price and product look like a good deal. Placed the order with all the high expectations of product previously purchase though this type of site. After about three week Amazon notified my the the order was cancelled due to the failure of the supplier to confirm the order. Ended up reordering the item through another supplier. If the product cannot be located by the supplier, the add should not be on the site or if the site must restock the item, proper notice should have been given to the buyer. This lack of decent behavior from a seller would prevent me from ever reordering any item from this merchant or suggesting them to anyone else. I understand problems can occur, but common decency goes a long way for customer satisfaction."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"Extremely disappointed. Worked well for about a week, poorly for a month; after that, ALL SIX were no longer functioning. I live in Bermuda, so they got plenty of sunlight."
1,Do Not Buy this Junk,"Junk from the start! Should have bought these type of products locally so I could take it back. Bought two of these lights. Did not work out of the box. Re-read the instruction to make sure I had not skipped any step.Back yard is facing south so it gets full sunlight all day in Colorado where there is at leat 330 days of sunlight enough to make these lights flicker. Nothing from these after several troubleshooting sessions.Bell & Howell used to be an awesome company, I suppose, like most everything else, ""used to be"" doesn't count..Stay away from these and vist your local hardware store."
3,Not very bright,This product has not given off much light. I think you would need two or three of them to be able to illuminate a small area.
2,Expected more,"I bought this solar light to light up my flag at night, but I don't feel It works good enough. I probable just need to put it in a place that gets more light through out the day. still I was expecting more."
4,Why Gurdjieff?,"I was put off buying this album at first because of the quote on the jacket about ""ancient music"" from G.I. Gurdjieff, the central asian guru who died in the fifties in France. Gurdjieff considered European culture worthless in favor of his notion of ""ancient"" music (read: imaginary, mythical and nonexistant) and he certainly did not have Bach in mind."
5,A Revelation in the Music of Bach,"It is well known that Bach was a mystical composer in the most Lutheran sense.In this fabulous CD, the arduous studies of Helga Thoene in connecting the glorious Bach Chaconne in D minor to several of standard German church hymns are realized.We hear each of the crucial hymns sung by themselves, interspersed with interludes of each of the famous Second Partita's movements played on the Solo Violin. The Finale is the coup de grace: the violin plays the final Chaconne once more - but this time the hymns are heard at the same time.The result is one of great spirituality and profound subtleties and of the most enjoyable revelations of the music of Bach yet.I recommend this to lovers of Bach, Hymns, Chorales, Violin music and mysticism. If it were possible to rate this higher than 5 stars, I would not hesitate. The singing is exquisitely sensitive as is the violin interpretation."
2,"So, what?","It still is just an hypothesis, not a proven theory. The idea is interesting, but it does not add anything to the current body of knowledge on Bach's music. Also, the tempi seem to be altered here and there just to make both pieces ""sound alike"". This is a CD that you will listen to once and forget about it."
1,Too mechanical,Although Ron Allen makes an attempt to sound very human when trying to explain his initial struggles to preach. His progression is very wooden in his approach. He doesnt seem to approach his topic from the feet of the throne but more on humanistic experience. Try again later when youve drawn nigh to the thrown of God Mr Allen then maybe your works wont be as spiritless.
4,If you want to learn a little bit of history...,"This book, although at times very hard to read the first time around, is a great insight into the history of a people who followed a way that has existed since the beginning of time. This book is recommended for anyone who has heard of the Sufis because of the rise of the so called ""new age"" movement gaining ground. Idres Shah delivers in this historical book with great stories as well as significant historical preferences that paints a clear picture of where the artform of alchemy and the occult originated from. Insightful, informative, funny, and fun to read, the Sufis has proven to be a gem in my ever expanding and ever growing library."
2,Fair book for pseudo-Sufi studies,"This is one of Shah's books which ""popularized"" the Sufi path in America. While it can be viewed as a very general ""introduction"" and is interesting in parts, it lacks the authority of scholarship and experience. The author, Idries Shah, was a self-proclaimed ""Sufi Master"" and falsely claimed numerous titles for himself. If you want a good, honest introduction to the Sufi path, read ""Heart, Self, and Soul"" by Robert Frager or""Irshad"" by Muzaffer Ozak. If, on the other hand, you are looking for a New-Age, watered down, westernized ""Sufism"" stripped of it's spiritual essence, than I guess Idries Shah is for you"
5,Introduction to the Sufis,"This is an introduction to Sufi thought by Indries Shah, a leading Sufi wrter and teacher. It covers important Sufi masters, as well as chapters on dervishes, miracles, an an esoteric interpretation of the Koran. Sufism is commonly believed to be a sect of Islam, but this is not necessarily true. Not all Sufis are Muslims. The path of the Sufis seems to include group participation, initiation, and finding a Sufi Master."
5,... what a difference the years make...,"Picked this book up in my ""seeking"" as one more path to learn about. What I found is something that taught history, talked about ""spiritual"" matters in a way that was non-new-age-y and made me stretch my brain. Made sense in a logical non-magical thinking sort of way. And it got me angry in parts 'cuz I felt like it was written poorly or was being patronizing, obtuse. That was the first read. About 6 years and many other Shah books later, I read things I had NEVER seen before-in the same copy of the same book! ""Got"" this notion of the scatter method of teaching/relaying information... a little. If you are interested in pursuing the notion of an objective truth and are turned off by the sentimentality and lack of depth/substance of new age material, this book may be of interest to you...Have fun!"
3,Sufi con men,"The question sufism is very complicated, in part because of the deceptions created by its proponents. Shah's misleading and over hyped work on the subject is a genuine bum steer, with a lot of oulala come on, carrot dangling and mystification. Promoting this subject as a booby trap to attract liberal westerners is not a nice thing to do. Keep in mind this fellow had a secret arrangement of some kind with Gurdjieff, which should set the trust meter down ten pegs. The sufis (most of whom are harmless 'mystics') are cruellest and most sadistic of the New Age prophets on the loss. They don't deserve an iota of trust.Keep in mind that Sufis never speak of Enlightenment or liberation. Be forewarned."
4,Swamp Fox,"I used to only have this music collection on cassette tape, and searced for some time to replace the worn out version with a crisp sounding CD. This is one of my favorite collections of Tony's. I love the bluesy guitar and soft smoldering Southern style of Polk Salad Annie & Rainy Night in Georgia. I was in high school when he hit the charts in July of '69 and ""Polk Salad"" was one of my favorite hits. To this day whenever it comes on the radio or I pop the cd into my player, it brings back so many fun memories of us all singing and humming to the tune, I will never forget! So pop it in and sing along you will never forget what you were doing the first time you ever heard this Southern-gumbo Style singer either!"
4,Amazing oportunity to understand the great voice and music arrangements of Tony: MUST BE IN YOUR COLLECTION !,"I bought this CD thanks to the sale offer Amazong inform me. It was a hard to fine CD from long years ago. Now I believe I was purchased one of the best record of the year !. The hits compilation is the best sample of who Tony had not all the press and major press attention. Tony was as JJ Cale, great and personal music ocult below the Billboard hits.However, unfortunately the CD had not include Tony other hits made him a great singer and musician.Buy it now..good price for a collection CD!"
5,"just saw him live in a small club May, 2011 in Pittsburgh","My favorite live music show in years, just Tony Joe solo w/ with his electric and a very funky lookin' stompbox that he has maybe had since the 1960'sOne of the true underrated Songwriters and Musicians of all time"
5,A treasure! Best reference book on the topic available!,"Much more than a dictionary, this is better described as a desk encyclopedia of classical mythology. Tea ching adult-education courses on classical topics, i use this constantly in preparation and recommend it whole-heartedly to my students. Everyone who has bought it loves it.To compare it to other standard works: Bulfinch is a standard, but dated; Graves is more scholarly but very heavy reading and is marred by Insistence on his White Goddess hobbyhorse; Hamilton is too elementary, pitched to a young readership."
4,Unique in itself,I love this series of books! I'm not a dog person at all. But these books are written in such a manner that you can not help but drawn into a world which is like no other. I wowed my friends this year when I started talking about Standard Poodles during the Westminster.
5,Grounds for disciplinary action,"I bought this cassette for a friend who said he's been late for work every day since I gave it to him. He said he gets in the parking lot on time, but is laughing so hard that he can't get into the building on time. He's afraid he'll either have to stop listening on his way to work or face disciplinary action for chronic lateness."
4,Yes it does work on xp,oh ya and yes this game does work on xp maby its somthing with your settings or something
1,Not worth the headache,"I have a brand new computer and thought to start putting some games on. so i bought the deluxe version of b&w and it is unable to play. i've tried updating drivers, it's just the game that sucks. don't uninstall the windows hotfix kb82...141 that some jerks tell you to uninstall. when i did that it made my computer go into an unending cycle of trying to reboot. i had to reinstall windows to get it working again. i hate lionhead games for still selling an obviously flawed game without usefull support or patches."
3,MY REVEIW,"this game is ok but it needs a bit more of a twist, it is to easy to start another game. i know a game is good when it is hard for me to start playing another game for at least a month. i recomend it to people who play all the games they have no matter if they like one better"
2,Does not work with XP,This game does is not compatible with XP although the box states that it is. After several tries with EA Tech support I was able to get disk one Black & White running after downloading patch 1.2. I was not successful with Creature Island though and have not managed to play it. I do not recommend buying this game if you have Windows XP as your operating system; it is a waste of money and time.
2,It should NOT be stated that this operates on XP...,"This absolutely should not be considered to work on xp...there are sound issues, mouse issues...what a friggin mess. I finally got the original to work...it would still switch to desktop after one click but I could alt+tab back into it with success. Don't have 5.1 turned on...you won't get any sound. As for creature isle....no matter what I've tried it will always crash back to the desktop after clicking within the game...terrible compatibility issues."
4,It will work on XP.,I must say this is a fun game. It has great points in lots of stuff! Although EA won't tell you this it won't run because of KB 824141-x86-enu. If you have that go to the remove programs application and choose to unistall it.WARNING: Some games may need this and also it makes you less secure. If that won't get it too run you may have a 3D card it doesn't like. Although they shouldn't have said it was XP compatible if you have to do that when they don't tell you to do that.
4,Rockports on the CHEAP!,"I bought these shoes for around [...]. What a deal! Only thing is, I did by a Wide for my fat feet, but that made them too big. Had I bought my regular size, they would be perfect. Very stylish and well made."
4,It Works,I purchased the product to connect a projector to my HP computer with Media center. It keeps me from having to unhook my monitor when I want to watch movies or online shows. It works very well!
3,Works But Not Very Well,Causes signal loss between tv and monitor on 3 feet of cable and degrades picture really bad.It could be good for work presentations but in a living room its best to use a switchbox that can boost your signal.I dont know if this can screw up your equipment so i wouldnt recomend it.
4,Computer -> TV + Monitor,"I use this to connect my TV and monitor to my laptop. It displays on both screens just fine. If you have a widescreen, you might have resolution issues unless you want to just use the middle of your screen.The quality is about 95% definitely not super HD image, but I watch movies on my TV just fine without having to switch cables."
1,Garbage,"This is truly a piece of garbage. The signal gets degraded and you'll get bands running up and down your screens, plus the image will be dim and even the maximum manual brightness level on monitors won't compensate sufficiently to not be distracting."
2,"Cable, VGA Y, HD15 Male To HD15 Female",The clarity of the picture is not as expectedImpair vision after a period of less qualityAppropriate for the price of the commodity before
3,It works but..,I have a dual monitor setup on a dual head ATI video card. One on VGA and the other on DVI. I bought this cable for a 3rd display which is my LCD tv for watching movie. Once I connect the TV via VGA the monitor that shares the VGA starts looking grainy. Technically it works.
4,A great book to get a good start on Spanish,"I found this book an excellent way to get started in Spanish. Each lesson takes you through a conversation, illustrating a grammatical point (and teaching you vocubulary along the way). The grammar is illustrated through the conversation first, then certain grammatical rules are pointed out. This way, one can learn Spanish the way one usually learns their own native language; specifically, by hearing the sentence structure over and over again and ""absorbing"" the rules.However, be warned that the pronunciations provided in the book are characteristic of Spanish as spoken in Spain, and not Latin American pronunciations. I think this book works best if practiced along with a audio tape.The only other complaint is that the present tense is studied for the first two-thirds of the book. Then in the last third of the book, they cover three additional tenses very quickly. But, I still think it is a good book to get started in Spanish."
4,It works,"I've used Berlitz books for Spanish, Italian, and German. No, you will not speak fluently after using these books, but you will SPEAK. You will be able to understand basic conversation and read simple things. Better than nothing, and it takes only 20 to 30 minutes a day. Besides, these books are fun."
3,Pues.........,"This book is a good introduction to Castillian Spanish as spoken in Spain. Gramatically it is disappointing as it only covers in any depth the present, preterite (past),and future tenses. There are in total fifteen verb tenses, including another past tense,the imperfect. The other tenses including the emotion rich subjunctive are barely covered! !Qué lastima!(What a shame!)"
4,berlitz spanish,Bought this book for my wife when she was taking a spanish class. She was pleased with the content.
3,Poor quality,"It's ok for a beginner which I am. But the very first time the driver was used, it broke! Not due to hitting on the ground or anything like that. It just snapped. Never would have believed it. The other clubs are fine, so still rate the entire set 3 stars - ok for the price paid."
2,picture this,"I bought these for Xmas for my son. I just received these and they have square heads. They don't even come close to matching the picture of the product. If my son doesn't like them, they'll be going back."
1,Fighting force II,"Wow, what an immense dissapointment this game turned out to be. The good folks at Eidos are responsible for some outstanding games--the brilliant ""Tomb Raider"" being among their finest. They really dropped the ball this time. Fighting Force II is a complete waste of time and money--this isn't even worth the price of a rental--not even if you have a coupon for a free rental! Let me summarize briefly: sloppy control, lackluster graphics, moronic artificial intelligence, boring level design, mediocre sound, and to top it off, it just isn't any fun beside all these problems. I have enormous patience with video games; sometimes one has to delve deeply into a game to appreciate its finer points. As far as I'm concerned, this game has no finer points. Not only is a poor game, it's got its share of bugs too. This is a good example of a company rushing a product to the X-mas market when it should have seen quite a bit more development time. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE"
1,Miserable,"Gamers out there, beware! This could be the game that underutilizes the capabilities of DC more than any other game out there. For those deranged individuals who say it compares favorably with Metal Gear Solid, I say you're out of your mind (must've been posted by the chief FF2 programmer). Graphics are mediocre, game engine is underdeveloped, and the storyline is weak and unimaginative. Duke Nuke'em, Metal Gear, even Doom are vastly superior; heck, I'd rather play Tetris. I'm going to use the disc for a coaster."
1,Don't even think about it...,"This is the biggest waste of money for Dreamcast yet. Unless you count Test Drive 6. The graphics are good, but everything else is lame. The game is boring and the sound effects are weak. I took this one out and started playing Space Invaders on my Atari 2600 for some excitement."
2,Fighting Force 2 puts the ucks in sucks,"FF2 really bites, the sound is awful. Not to menchin thehorrible graphics I mean the only reason people bought the Dreamcastwas for better graphics, Fighting Force puts the Dreamcast to shame.FF2's graphics are just a little bit better than psx's ff.Spend your money on something else, anything besides Fighting Force2."
3,Fighting Force 2? A major suprise and disappointment,"With horrible sound, annoying movement and control, this game puts Eidos and Core to shame. Like we havent already seen enough crappy games such as every single ""Tomb Raider"". The suprise to me was how different it was from the first one. I respect its way of a different kind of gameplay that only a few games use such as ""Syphon Filter"" and ""Metal Gear Solid"". Not to mention the graphics are terrible and certainly did not take full advantage of the systems capabilities. If you've seen the previews for games ""Shenmue"" or "" R.E. Code Veronica"", those are examples of superb graphics. The levels in the game are just long, not because they are hard, just because they're really...really.....long and boring. The challenge isnt really there but if you're looking for a quick, fun, game to play, by the end of the weekend you'll be happy you hadnt bought it. Save your money, there will be bigger and better dreamcast games to come."
4,Give it a chance...,"Look, I bought this game and let me tell you, it is not the best game. But, to actually enjoy it to it's full potential, you have to stick with it. Once you get past the gameplay and other things, and get really good at the game, you'll like it. ONLY FOR THE PATIENT GAMER!"
4,It is okay.,"This game isn't that bad. Compared to the other games by Edios, it could have been a little better. Plus, unlike the first one, there is no multiplayer."
1,10 Dollars can be to much for a Dreamcast Game,"Graphics are nice, running around and blowing everything up is nice, walking up to an enemy, beating the daylights out of him while his partner sits there and watches you isn't very nice. Having enemy's randomly span out of walls to run out an fight you isn't nice, repetative gameplay isn't nice, running back and forth over levels looking for the proper key/switch isn't nice. All in all, this game has more not so nice features then nice ones.How did this game get a decent rating from people? Well, alot of people bought Deer Hunter as well."
1,Sick game!,"If I could give this game negative score , I would do it.First of all , It is action game , it should be have some fast action,but this game's just slow .The graphic is just a little bit better than PSX version. For the control is sick(angle problem).I played this game in 10 min ,it make me dizzy.OK ,If you'll buy this game , make sure you have extra money for medicine."
1,Worst game I have ever played.,"Eidos has the Unique label of making the BEST game I have ever played, Deus Ex, and the WORST BY FAR game I have ever touched, this Fighting Force 2. Camera angles are horrible, gameplay is boring and horrible, story is horrible, sound is horrible, graphics are horrible, do you see a pattern here?Most EIDOS games are not worth buying, and I DID RETURN this game. It insults my position as a buyer looking for a good game. (If I was only a tester for this before they released it!!)"
3,OK,"the good,it has a lot of action and there are a lot of weapons and all. the bad,it has a bad story,bad sound,okay graphics could be better,the weapons break after 2 min and its really easy. if u like fighting games ALOT u should buy if not dont"
3,Yo! Stop hating!,"Actually, I would give this 3 1/2 stars. The thing is, it's medicore, has middling graphics, average repetitive gameplay, and can be tough to beat. So it's not that much fun in single player. But where it shines is multiplayer! I can't tell you how fun it is to hook up with some of your friends and unload on all the baddies in this game. Added bonuses are the guns and stuff you can pick up. Final Fight games were always meant to be played with a friend, just like the Double Dragon games before it. Get it if you've got friends and controllers; pass it if you're a lonely gamer with no friends."
5,Freedom Crossing,"In Freedom crossing Laura, Bert, and Joel help a runaway slave, named Martin. Martin is a 12 years old boy who wants to go to Canadawhere his Dad is waiting. But, when Joel takes him to Laura's house to keep him safe, she doesn't think it is right to hide runaway slaves. Will Laura let Martin stay? I think 3rd graders and up should read this book because it will teach you a lot about history and runaway slaves. It is very exciting when the slave catchers come! I'd rate this book five stars and say it is one of the best books I've ever read. Freedom Crossing is awesome!written by Sydney"
3,Freedom Crossing,"Book Reviewby JoshRoom 11Freedom Crossing by Margaret Goff Clark, is a historical fiction book. Freedom Crossing takes place in Lewiston NY. I thought Freedom Crossing was an ok book. The reason I think it is an good book because it has some action. I liked when Laura's carriage got stolen. I also liked when Laura got a package and it had a secret code. I do recommend this book because it has suspense."
3,Freedom Crossing,"Book reviewBy Molly AshlandThe book Freedom Crossing by Margaret Goff Clark is historical fiction about a family helping slaves escape to Canada. The book is ok in the beginning, but it starts to get interesting and exciting after reading a chapter or two. For example, in chapter 4, Bert and Laura's neighbor comes to their house and almost sees the slave they were hiding. The book was my favorite book we've read yet."
4,Freedom Crossing,"Freedom Crossing is a historical fiction book written by Margaret Goff Clark. It's about helping a slave get freedom. I thought Freedom Crossing was a great book because it was a book that was hard to put down. One of the parts when it was exciting was when the slave catchers came because I thought Martin the slave was going to get captured. I recommend this book to kids that are 9 and up, it is a thriller."
2,"An ""ok"" book","We didn't really like the book because it was kinda predictable. That made it boring to read. However, Martin was a very likeable character and there were cliffhangers at the end of chapters."
3,Not fabulous historical fiction,"I read this book in my fifth grade Humanities class. In my opinion,this book is not one of the greats such as Avi's, The Fighting Ground and James Collier and Christopher Collier's, My Brother Sam Is Dead. On the other hand, there was wonderful suspense at the end of each chapter, however, the book was so predictable you were almost saying the words. My class enjoyed discussing slavery more than the book."
4,This is almost the best book I have ever read!,"I read the book Freedom Crossing. It was very exciting. One of the reasons I liked this book so much was it tells you your history depending on your culture. Some people might have not learned how slaves were treated. Another reason is the people take chances of freeing slaves (letting freedom ring). Some of the reasons I don't like this book is that I really don't like the way they explain how slaves were treated. They made it sound more dramatic, and I didn't like that. Another thing I dont like is how slave catchers just get to go into people's houses with out being invited over or in.Some of the other things I disliked about this story is how the slaves had to run away. This is a very exciting story! You should try reading it! By: Sheonta"
1,The Worst Game For the Playstation,"This game is just so bad, I have barely anything to say about it since I played it for so little time. Combat is run up and hit the enemy, go back, do these same two things again until you're bored out of your mind. All of the sound effects are really weird, and just plain annoying. There is no dual shock support, analog control, and the loading times are even noticeable. Plus, the graphics are just filled with glitches to the brim. Even navigating around the little menu is a chore. I know there are some bad games out there, but only a few are truly horrible. Shadow Tower is one of them."
5,Uniform Commercial Code,An excellent supplemental resource for any law student or lawyer practicing in the field of commercial transactions.
1,"Horrible, scammed, missing cards","After receiving the cards in the mail it only took a minute to realize that 3 cards were missing. The product description indicated there would be 62 cards, I recieved 59. As it turns out, the 3 missing cards were the only holographic cards contained in the deck. So the three best cards, and coolest, are gone. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Who knows how many cards will be missing in other packs."
3,Meh...,"I bought this card game for my 8 year old daughter as she enjoys the Digimon cartoon on tv. We found it to be so complicated to play that she didn't enjoy it. She's a smart kid, but there just didn't seem to be any 'play value' in this game for her."
2,AC charger is very short-lived,"Bought this as a replacement charger. AC charger worked for three and a half weeks before the connection wore out. I'd say you get what you pay for, but even the more expensive chargers I've used are poorly made and don't last very long.My car charger still works, so it's not a total loss. I guess all I can say is, when buying a phone charger, get the cheapest you can find and get several."
4,A good follow up to the Vivaldi album,How do you sell a CD of greatest hits by a Mezzo? Well it could be difficult as if you get them to sing the same old classics then everyone might have those songs and might not buy it.One thing you can do is to record older material which do not form part of the conventional repatoire which might be attractive. You can market it by putting it out in a booklet like CD which is run as a concept.This is what has happened with Cecilia with first her Vivaldi CD and now with her rendition of Gluck arias. In fact the CD is great. The arias are all treasures and her rendition of them is great. I think that I am enjoying it a bit more than the previous CD.
1,A . B i g . D i s a p p o i n t m e n t ! ! !,"A Big Disappointment!!!I was a big fan of Cecilia Bartoli in her early recordings. She was great singing Rossini and Mozart Opera. She was even better singing Soprano-Arias than mezzo Arias. Unfortunately, as her voice is very small and rather unsuited for live opera she was told to sing antique music (Gluck, Handel, ...) as a mezzo. As a result her voice and technique changed to worse. In these Gluck Italian Arias the amount of air in her voice is tremendous, almost disphonic. This is more likely to older Jazz Singers(!) Not to classical vocalists. The colour of her voice appears artificially pressed. I really miss the SOPRANO Cecilia Bartoli!!!Her refreshing Italian temperament which she showed fabulously in Mozart's Coos Fan Tutte and Rossini's Works (and should do more of this) is unsuited in Guck's and Handel's Music. Their masterpieces are great but her voice and performance are suffering more and more."
5,Lucky Gluck,"This week Bartoli sang a major part of this cd in her Amsterdam-recital and in particular the Berenice-aria was incomparable. It must be so gratifying for Gluck, on his cloud up there, to be restored to acclaim by such a singer centuries later."
1,Dated with few hardbody references,"I have a 1991 Hardbody Pickup and was very disappointed that this book had very little to say - or illustrate about it. A majority of the photos are 1980-85 as well as the references. I've always bought Haynes manuals in the past but this one was of very little help. If you have a pre-Hardbody vehicle it might be worth it, but not if it's anything after 1986."
1,PURE JUNK!!,"SHEETS TORE APART AFTER FIRST WASHING BEFORE EVEN USING THEM, NOT WORTH RETURNING FOR S&H COST!! STAY AWAY FROM THESE NO MATTER HOW CHEAP THEY ARE. THEY DON'T EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR BUT YOU HAVE TO RATE THEM WITH THIS OR THE REVIEW WON'T POST!!"
1,"Junkie, junkie, junkie!","I ordered several sets of Pike flannel sheets, a total of four twin (2 a piece for each of our boys) and two sets of king-sizes for our bed. They pill and leave a mess everywhere. I washed them seperately but that didn't make a difference.I'm tired of having to constantly vacuum the mess they leave behind.I just tossed out all 6 sets. I don't feel bad because I didn't actually put out any money out of pocket because I had Amazon gift certificates that I applied towards my purchase.I think I'll look into jersey knit sheets for the winter or just 'better' flannel sheets."
1,waste of money,"I don't know what sheets the other reviewers here are sleeping on, but these sheets are awful. After the second night, we started seeing red fluff everywhere, and at first couldn't figure out what it was. Then we realized it was coming off the sheets! It is all over everything, including my new comforter. I couldn't throw them in the garbage any faster!"
1,Piece of sheet....,"I wrote before that it's great for it's price, but, unfortunately, I have to take my words back. I think it's better to ""invest"" in something more expensive, but something that will be practical to use. These sheets are soft and warm but there is just too much pilling from them. It gets into your hair, on your clothes, on the matress and on everything you wash with it. I already washed them twice and there is still too much pilling.Don't buy them unless you want everything in your house to ""shine with stars"" made out of flannel pills."
3,meh,"after one washing, there were lint balls on my other clothes from the dryer. Sewing came apart on one of the pillow cases. But it was cheap and it is still nice to get into ""warmer"" flannel sheets than cold crisp regular sheets. There's no value, but it is inexpensive."
2,Could be better,"Attract cat hair like a magnet. Warm and soft, okay quality, they were for my daughters bed so it works well for her, I wouldn't want them on my bed."
2,Its warm BUT it sheds!!,"Its pretty comfortable and the price can't be beat. However, I would not recommend this product. It sheds small pieces of lint all over the place. I have had to vacuum around the bed quite a few times because of this product. I should have taken note of the warnings of previous posters on this problem."
2,Great Price,"Theses sheets were no different than any other flannel sheets in the stores EXCEPT, for the price. You cannot beat the price. My biggest complaint with the sheets is that for the first SEVERAL washings, it colors everything you wash with it. I bought the Brick Red and everytime I was anything with the sheets, everything comes out red!!! The sheets also leave colored lint on everything. Overall they are good sheets, I dont think I would order them again, even for the price, because all the hassle that I have to deal with afterwards. I rated them a 2 ONLY because of the price."
3,Ok for the money,"To get a set of sheets for a king size bed for under $50 is a deal. These were under $20 so I can't complain that they were a little thin and I eventually put my finger through the corner while trying to make the bed. Other than that, they were comfortable.Soon they'll make great dust rags! *LOL*"
1,Poor Product,After I received this set I washed/dryed them only to find half of them left. They literally fell apart in the process. They were quickly repackaged & returned. Best part of experience was Amazon's customer service regarding the return. Don't waste your time on these.
3,Flannel Sheet Set,"After washing these items, I had to dry them twice because of all of the lint generated. I had to clean out the dryer lint trap three times during drying because the lint clogged the trap and slowed drying. These sheets and pillow cases generated much more lint than any of my other flannel sheet sets. I am not talking about a little lint, but rather a lot of lint."
1,"AWFUL , junk sheets","I have never bought a set of the red and one of green flannel sheets. I have washed the sheets and dried them a few times to try to get the fuzzy balls of and NO LUCK. There are seriously THOUSANDS on the sheets. I tried taking them outside and shaking them out which helped very little, I had to lay them out on the floor and spend hrs pulling the fuzzies off with tape. I WILL NEVER BUY again."
3,watch the fabric,"If you are looking for a cotton sheets, american type you are in the wrong path. Even, they are nice for the price"
5,a bargain!,"I purchased this item for the incredible price of $5.99. What a bargain! Flannel sheets are the best for the winter, and these are of decent quality for that incredible price."
4,Nice quality!,I bought in King size after being really pleased with the twins & doubles for my kids. My only complaint with the solid green: I noticed some pilling after the first wash. That didn't happen on the patterned sheets.But they're VERY soft & warm. Great value!
2,not what i expected,i ordered many of these for myself and for gifts they are very thin and not as warm as i was hoping they would be----but you get what you pay for as the price was really low
4,Soft And Comfy,These sheets are very soft and the price was excellent. Only draw back is they get tiny flannel balls after washing.
1,To thin!!,I just received these sheets about 2 weeks ago. I just put them on my bed and after 2 days they already have holes in them. I purchase a set for my sons be also and they are wearing bad in areas. They are just very thin and do not hold up as I expected flannel to do. Other brands of flannel set's I have purchased are of a lot better quality.
1,These sheets are HORRIBLE,"I'm actually quite shocked at the other reviews stating these sheets are ""top quality""...I washed these first so I could put them on my bed and the pilling was unbelievable!!! Who wants to wake up covered in red fuzz every morning?? I guess you get what you pay for...I would NOT recommend these to anyone unless you want to become a redhead overnight!"
2,sheets,sheets are thin even after 1st washing. All the fuzz ended up in the dryer.a big disappointment.
3,Worth the price,"I ordered 3 queen sets...brick, floral scroll and floral rose for $15.99 each. I'm not that impressed with the quality, but rarely will you find a sheet set for that price in any size. This is certainly a ""get what you pay for"" situation and I'm mainly happy with my purchase."
1,Don't buy these--they end up in your dryer's lint filter.,"I bought these for the good price, but I wish I hadn't. The first time I washed them, the dryer trap was so full of green lint that I could hardly remove it to clean it. The sheets were covered with pills, which covered my clothes when I lay down on the bed. The sheets feel very thin and cheap and will never hold up. Save your money."
1,proud owner,"I ordered 3 sets,two twin, one queen. I washed two sets before use. The twin set seems fine. As for the dark green queen set? I am now the proud owner of a bucket of green lint and some cheese cloth! I'm afraid to wash the last set."
2,Sheets that Shed,These sheets are on the lower end of quailty. When you get them out of the dryer the lint trap is completely full of fluff. Also little balls of the sheets end up all over the place. I am not impressed.
1,you get what you pay for..,"Bought these for a guest bedroom and will not be using them. They really, truly are [...]. They must be disenegrating during drying, because there was a pound of lint each time, after two times of washing and drying. The pills are impossible to remove which leaves a pretty lumpy surface. ..."
3,very comfortable,"but, the sheet comes off a lot of stuff out of the sheet. It is pretty and comfortable, but that is a major problem when we use it."
5,Great,I bought a set for my grandmother and she absolutely loves them. She has a deep pocket mattress and they fit perfectly. She also said she hasn't' had any problems after washing them. I also bought a set but haven't used them yet. As soon as I do I will write another review.
2,Disappointed,"Disappointed, January 16, 2007Reviewer: Critiquer - See all my reviewsI was expecting this to be of the same quality as the Floral Rose that I ordered from the same company, but it wasn't. The pillow cases were smaller than the full-sized sheet set with the floral rose pattern. In all fairness, I will have to say that I am perfectly satisfied with the floral rose set, and find it very comfortable. I don't know why there is such a difference.Incidentally, having had such a positive experience with the Floral Rose sheet set, I ordered 2 blue twin sets , and was not saitisfied with these... I would recommend the Floral Rose sheet set, but not this."
3,"Not terrible, but wouldn't purchase again","Considering the price, I kept my expectations reasonable. I sort of expected pilling, but the pilling falls off and ends up all over my house. I have washed the sheets twice and I'm still finding the pills everywhere. The sheets are comfortable and the color is nice (brick red). In this case I got a little less than what I paid for. Even so, these sheets are nice to have while the good ones are in the wash."
3,12 dollars,Thats what I got these sheets for--a gift for someone.Now you know how much King size flannel sheets cost??? A lot--I was expecting awful quality because of previous posts. The sheets were fine--they were not tissue paper thin-washed well-fit well--you cannot beat them at that price.
1,BAD BAD SHEET SET-AWFUL VERY LINT -STOP,"BAD SHEET SET-I ALWAYS WASH NEW SHEETS-BAD -2 AND 1/2 HANDFULS OF BALLS AND LINT ,IN THE VERY FIRST WASH- I THOUGHT THE SECOND WASH WOULD MAKE THEM BETTER! BAD,AWFUL -READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE YOU BUY SHEETS FROM AMAZON-I WISH I HAD,BECAUSE I GAVE THHESE AS CHRISTMAS GIFTS,I HOPE MY FRIENDS WILL FORGIVE ME. I CRIED BECAUSE I GAVE THEM THESE LOUSY SHEETS-DO NOT BUY,YOU'LL BE SORRY YOU DID,PATSY"
5,They have it!,I could not find a store that carries flannel sheets in white like color but Amazon.com Great price too.
1,Falling apart after 5 days!,"These sheets are like thinly pressed dryer lint.Very soft and comfortable feeling- initially, they began to get picky by the third night. after the 5th night, I was pulling hard lint balls off. I guess they're better than sleeping on the mattress...maybe."
5,GREAT SHEETS,These sheets are soft wash well and set the pace for a great night's sleep. I love flannel sheets and these are the best so far.
2,Afraid they'll fall apart,"I bought two sets to take advantage of the free shipping, despite the low reviews. (I plan to buy good sheets once they go on clearance at the end of the season...) When I took one set out of the package there was already a hole in it. Amazon replaced them, but when I washed them they feel like they are going to fall apart. The filled up the lint collector. I have red and green lint everywhere, even after washing them. You get what you pay for."
2,Sheets are great....if you plan to NEVER wash them,"These sheets are a great price and great colors. However, as soon as I washed them, I thought they were going to completely fall apart there was so much lint all over the place. I still haven't put them on the bed, thinking I'd probably wake up the color of the sheets with lint all over me. I suggest you stay away from these, particularly red."
1,"Junk, do not waste your money","You truly get what you pay for in this case. We bought the red ones and they have left fuzzies all over the house. In the dryer, you need to check the lint trap frequently, as they shed like mad. They are not smooth and cozy, they have a very high coefficient of friction and it's sorta hard to scootch around on them. I would not recommend."
1,Not even worth the Bargain Price...,"I tend to add things to my wish list as I view them and therefore, I received these as a gift b/c I never took them off my wishlist. UGH!Thank goodness they only cost ~$10 because the first time they were washed they became see-through; that's how thin they are! After the second washing, they were handed down to my son who only has a full sized mattress because they no longer fit our queen."
3,Great deal at $9.99 but.....,"I got these at the $9.99 price a few weeks ago. I wish they did not fade as quickly as they did, but it is barely enough to really complain about. They have not fuzzed up and they are very warm. The only reason I am giving three stars instead of four is because of how fast they faded.$9.99 is a great price, but I am not to sure about the $24.99 that they are now."
3,FuzzFuzzFuzz!,"These sheets are adequate for someone looking at a CHEAP flannel sheet set. At such a great price who can complain about the fact they will overload your dryer lint trap with fuzz, (no exageration, check it halfway thru drying to avoid fire hazard).Despite this and their fabric pilling, I still appreciate I was finally able to get flannel on my bed in the winter so for the price I am happy."
2,"Varying quality, some are *really bad*","I got the navy and light blue versions of these - for about the same price as the awesome Wamsutta flannels from last year. While lightweight and very linty for a couple washes, the light blue ones are comfortable and have been durable. The navy sets I ordered are terrible - some undone seams, linty even after a dozen or more washes, other parts are starting fray, and they attract cat hair like nothing I've ever seen. Don't know how or why, but I won't order them again just in case."
1,Flannel balls up :o(,"Great price, however the flannel balls up and leaves large lint and lots of lint all over the carpeting and spread."
2,Pike Street Flannel Sheet Set,"Although the sheets are warm, I'm not crazy over them. They pilled up badly right after the first time washing them, and they leave little fuzzballs all over my floor. If you have pets, their fur will collect all over it. It looks terrible."
3,Not bad for the price,I got these sheets for my son who is a teenager. They are okay for the price. They are warm but shrink everytime I wash them. They leave alot of lint in my dryer too. The material is not too strong because I put my finger through them when putting them on the mattress. They are okay for the price!
1,extreme lint,I was very upset with these sheets and how much lint is STILL coming off. It totally clogged my dryer. I have washed them 3 times and I still come up with a trap full. Should have sent them back.
2,Not so great,"The sheets have huge lint balls, which get on your floor, your clothes, your hair, your comforter, your blanket. I don't recommend these sheets."
1,Shedding mess!,"I bought these because they were offered at such a great price....i guess you really do get what you pay for. I know that it is normal for flannel sheets to shed in the laundry and pill up....but these take the cake. I have had to stop my drying cycle twice during each drying of these sheets to unclog the lint trap. I'd be ok if the dryer cleaned them up, but not so...they continue to leave lint pills everywhere in my house even after shaking them outside. Last week i purchased a set at Target for $2 more and they were definitely worth it, no major lint (except the stuff left from the pike street set on my comforter!) and much softer. Would never buy from this manufacturer again"
1,crap,"The fuzz is everywhere and they came with splits seams and runs in the fabric. I was very disappointed! They are literally garbage. I thought I had got a great deal, boy was I WRONG."
1,"Cheap , but still way overpriced!","I love flannel sheets, I live in San francisco where you can use them year round. But these are the worst sheets I've ever bought. I keep washing them, over and over, they keep filling my dryer with pill balls. Navy blue ""dust"" is all over my bedroom and all over any items washed with the sheets. I cough at night from breathing the flannel ""dust"". I've washed these 4 times and hence can't return them to Amazon. I threw them away. Please save your money and buy some decent quality sheets."
2,Disappointment,"These seemed so soft when we got them. Then I washed them and the lint war began. There was SO MUCH LINT everywhere!!! And with the navy color we had it showed up very much. After several washes they are better but they now seem very thin. And still fill up my lint trap on the dryer. My husband loves them, but I regret buying them."
1,"Pike street Flannel King Sheet, Navy","Poor quality. this product cost almost as much to ship back as the total purchase price. After one washing, recommended before use, the sheets pilled, color ran, and had runs."
2,thickness,"after i washed them once, i felt that all the 'flannel' went away. they did not stay thick. am glad i got them on sale, i would be very... very upset, if i payed full price for these and then have them loose 1/2 the fullness when washed the first time"
2,Disappointed Amazon Even Sells These....,"I know they are cheap, they've gone down in price at least twice since I first bought them a couple months ago, but they are of really poor quality! I've bought perfectly nice flannel sheets, king-size, for $10 more, that didn't shed one bit. These make a huge mess in the washer, dryer, laundry room, bed, bedroom, and all over whatever clothing they come in contact with; it's absurd, and I really can't believe Amazon soiled their usually fine reputation selling junk like this. I bought three sets, and they aren't worth the postage to send them back....."
2,Warm sheets...cheap manufacture,"The sheets are warm, but they are not like the flannel that I am used to. They shed enough during and especially after each of the first 3-4 washes that one could knit a sweater out of the lint that you have to vacuum off the bed, pick off your clothes, and brush off of your skin--not to mention the huge lint balls that you pull out of the dryer after drying one of these sheet sets. Worth the price...barely."
2,Horrendous!,"I bought 2 sets each of the twin size Brick and Navy Blue.I opened and washed 1 of each color - seperately because of the pillig issue I read - and even after 4 wash and drys (and FULL dryer filter cleanouts after each dry) - they STILL have bits coming off .To top it off, with all the 'fuzz' in the dryer filter - they are now no longer as soft and thick as when I first opened the package and they haven't even been used yet.I see from some reviews that the light solid colors seem to not have the same issue so maybe this is some type of dye process issue."
1,Unusable,"I bought these sheets on sale thinking they'd make a nice backup set to my existing flannels. We received them and they felt soft, if a little thin. Unfortunately, after my wife ran them through a laundry cycle, the sheets became covered in lint and were quite ""pilly"". We tried washing them again but it didn't have much of an effect, other than filling up our dryer's lint screen again. I suggested that we at least try putting the sheets on the bed but as soon as we started to put them on, we could see a copious amount of red lint starting to stick to our mattress pad, pillowcases, and virtually every other surface within 5 feet of the sheets. My beagle looked like Elmo! (OK, not really on that last part.) All kidding aside, we were too frustrated at the quality of the sheets to bother trying to make them work any more, and got rid of them. Definitely not recommended."
1,"If you like LINT, you'll love these sheets.","I agree with another reviewer who had a big problem with the lint factor on the red sheets. I like the color. They're kind of thin, but that's okay. They are soft. BUT...I had to clean the lint filter twice during one drying cycle. I washed them twice to see if it was just the intitial washing that created all of the lint, but it was almost as bad the second time. And there were still lots of lint balls all over the sheets when I took them out of the dryer. I don't plan on using these sheets. I'm very sorry I bought them and would return them if I could. Maybe the lighter colors are better, but I won't be spending any more money to find out."
3,cheap sheets,they are what they are cheap sheets. I dont suggest putting them in the dryer they loose about half their material first time around. but not bad for cheap throw aways.
2,"feels soft, looks cheap","I bought two sets, not satisfied with their quality.I will keep them just because they are too cheap to return?!"
1,Half of it turns to LINT in the dryer!!,Sure these sheets are cheap and YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!! I got a set thinking it was a deal but when I washed them they overloaded my lint trap. I put them on the bed and we had navy blue fuzzies all over us. I'm on the 5th wash and they still suck as bad as when I got them. Buyer beware: you get what you pay for.
2,Not so great,Sheets are thin and leave lint balls all over my mattress. You really have to stretch them out to fit on a higher mattress. But you get what you pay for.
1,fuzz balls,I found they were soft when first gotten. I put them in the wash cycle and had fuzz balls all over. Did put them on bed and now everything has or gets fuzz balls on them. You actually wear this on your clothes for a very long time.
1,Don't waste your money,This sheet set was truly icky. It pilled the first time I washed it and filled up my lint catcher three times on the first time in the dryer.After having them on the bed for approximately 6 months the sheet frayed into nothingness in one spot. I would not recommend these.

5,Russell Crowe: Man & Myth,"Sometimes fantasy reveals more than reality. And sometimes the best way to get to know an enigmatic superstar like Russel Crowe is to explore the myth as well as the man. Gabor H. Wylie's super book reveals more about Crowe than all the magazine articles and books (well only one other book, which was OK, but not nearly as good as this) I have read. A Life in Stories is well-written and compelling, halfway between a biography and a novel, yet focused on illuminating the real Crowe. The pictures are great (they made my wife melt--to my chagrin) and the format of the book is beautiful. Despite Carla's unfounded criticism, I can truly say that A Life in Stories is the best celebrity biography I've ever read. Crowe is an amazing actor. It's about time sometime did justice to his mysterious power."
1,Horrible [book],"This is the worst excuse of a book. And I take exception to it being called a book. It only exploits an actor/celebrity with old and sometimes wrong material, plus 90 percent of it is the fantasy scenarios/dialog (and [terrible] ones at that) of the author. I hated it and I wish I could get my money back!"
1,left out,this book is not a true account nor is it up to date in what it shares. It is probably taken from magazines and made up. would not recomed this to anyone.
5,"Fun, witty, innovative, and informative","I agree with another reviewer that sometimes myth reveals more than reality. Gabor H. Wylie's book is a tour de force in the way of celeb bios. With wit and energy, the author provides facts and fictions on the adored and revered Russell Crowe. I recommend this book to anyone looking for an entertaining page-turner, or just a good book to curl up under the covers with."
4,Interesting yet informative,This book really gives information to those that are not familiar with Crowe's upbringing and the obstacles he faced to in order to become where he is today. I enjoyed it.
3,"Rhinegold, Grundy","I am reading this book now for the third of forth time now. I think it is a nice book: a strong story and easy to read. However I miss the spark. Wagners telling of the same story grabs you and holds you. Even when the music stops after 15 hours. Grundy couldn't do that to me. I read this before I go to sleep, to relax. Some parts however are strong: I like the part about Runes very much, although I wanted something more than just the translations of the old Icelandic verses. And the again, sometimes the use of Runes is coming back in the story itself. I think the Gods are a little to human: more focused on women than on the education of mankind. Also Sigmund and Sinfjotli's life in the woods is a little disturbing (can't think of a correct describtion of the feeling) to me. All together: I like the book but I think it is not more than that; a likeable book."
3,Would have been better as a multi-volume work,"Grundy tries to cover too much material in one volume. Even with a genealogy chart, it was too difficult to follow the characters and I didn't get a sense of any of their personalities except Sigifrith and Hagan. I much prefer Diana Paxson's trilogy dealing with the same subject. In Grundy's work, the women are minor characters while Paxon's Brunnhilde and Gudrun are major ones. By the way, an Asatruar from Arizona told me that Grundy and Kveldulf Gundarsson are the same person. True? I hope that Grundy/Gundarsson come out with more fiction and non-fiction works. Rhinegold should come back into print, if only because it helps readers fill in the gaps of Attila's Treasure. (AT is clearly the better book, but they should be read together.)"
4,Please reprint!,"I borrowed this book from a friend and could not put it down. I was totally absorbed with the story and found it fascinating. I really hope that it will be reprinted, as I would like to have my own copy."
2,What a bore ..........zzzzzz,"The first time I attempted to read this book I got so bored I gave up. After leaving Rhinegold on my bookshelf for about a year and a half I picked it up again determined to finish it. I did manage to complete it this time but it was a chore, there was no pleasure in reading this novel."
1,Fantasy? Yeah right,"If I could give this book no stars I would. I'd rather give the author a good hard spanking.This isn't fiction, it's a horrible retelling of the Saga of Sigurd the Volsung, but overextended and with a tremendous amount of unnecessary references to Christianity.Do yourself a favor and read a book on the Norse myths, it'll be easier to understand than this crude attempt at ""Fantasy"""
5,Totally Surrounded,"Once I began to read Totally Surrounded I could not put it down. I found myself submerged in the jungles and villages of the Philippines wondering what would happen next. This true story of a 19 year old student's two-week missionary trip turning into a six year stay, and all that she endured and accomplished, was not only interesting, but inspiring."
2,Lukewarm,"there are many things in this book that I do not agree with. For example, there is a chapter about what kind of Bible to choose and this author suggests it's okay to choose any kind of bible, even a protestant Bible. If you or someone you know has just become Catholic, don't get steered in the wrong direction with this book. Don't be a lukewarm. God deserves better."
5,Great for indoor usage!,"Smaller than my personal favourite, the Great Highland Bagpipes, the Fireside Bagpipes create a mellow, quieter sound which is great for indoor use. If you like bagpipe music but feel that the Highland Bagpipes are just too loud for your special occasion, consider having me play the Fireside bagpipes. I have used these pipes in several indoor situations where the Highland Bagpipes are just too loud. You still get that wonderful bagpipe music but at a sound level ideal for more intimate special occasions. In situations where you need both loud and soft bagpipe music, the Fireside Bagpipes give me the versatility to deliver both.To sum things up; great bagpipe, great for indoor use, marvelous visual design."
1,...not worth [the money],Beware...the description of the book is most of the book itself. No real practical advice at all. Save your money...
1,save your money,"this book is not worth the cost of shipping.. Don't waste your time, I ended up buying a set of outlines at http://www.baroutlines.com for a third of what this book cost me. They included a ton of great study guides and we're very friendly about answering my questions.5 stars!!"
5,Book Review: How To Study For The Bar Exam In Three Days,"Why had I not studied for the bar exam? Because I was working on a deadline for the manuscript of my first book.... Unfortunately, the deadline for the final manuscript was the Friday before the three-day bar exam period.[I]f you follow the methods outlined in this book, you will make the most of your limited time to study, and you will enter the bar exam on day one relaxed and ready to go. Whether you have studied a little or a lot for the bar exam, and whether you have taken the bar exam before or not."
5,Songs of tha Past,"I had the tape of this CD and aftermany years of use, it could no longer be heard.The CD is great and an on the CD thereare 2 songs that were not on the tape I have!!Karen"
4,Sung Like Irish Songs,"Years May Come, Years May Go is twenty-four minutes and nine seconds and was released in 1993. Years May Come, Years May Go by The Irish Rovers is a bunch of songs that are not Irish songs, but sound like Irish songs. My only beef with the cassette is that it is too short. Still I am giving Years May Come, Years May Go an A-.Side OneTwelve minutes and fifty-five secondsThe Unicorn#7 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles#2 U.S. Billboard Easy Listening#6 U.S. Cash Box Magazine Top SinglesLily the PinkWhiskey On A Sunday#75 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 SinglesYears May Come, Years May GoSide TwoEleven minutes and fourteen secondsFifi O'TooleGoodnight IreneSam HallThe Life of the Rover"
4,Tammy Cochran still pretty good !,"Even though I will always remember her song tribute to her two brothers that passed on, I have the cd but don't remember the exact title without the cd in front of me...I think it is ""Angels in Waiting""? Anyway she still has a pretty voice on this album and the hit song, which is what the title of the album is after is AWESOME and the most memorable for me. It is a catchy tune with a good meaning. All of the songs on the cd she really put her blood, sweat and tears into. It is definately from the heart. I am just so glad she found a new WONDERFUL record label that continues to bring out her beautiful voice in the best possible way. I like it when country artists can put themselves into the music and I love it when they write or co-write the songs, you can tell. Keep up the good work Tammy!"
2,Doesn't last,"Having had this for six months, it has died. When it worked, it worked ""OK"" making ice that was soft and melted quickly. However, it was very useful. Sadly, it died within six months. I called the company and got a ""so sad"" response."
2,sunpentown ice maker,"I purchased the first one back in May and it did not work. Had to send it back. Got the replacement and hooked it up. The control panel on the front was lifting off. It has a mind of its own. You cannot program it or bypass the timer. It shuts off for hours on end and then starts to make ice, makes one tray full then shuts off again. Very exasperating on a hot day. Makes me think this was not a new ice maker but refurbished, and not a good job at the refurbishing either. I would not recommend this ice maker to anyone. Very disappointing. And very expensive."
1,Poor quality,Would not recommend this product. The control panel started peeling off the day we got it. The ice had a weird taste to it even after we followed the instructions for cleaning it.
1,ice maker,It was so noisy and made about an ice cube every four hours or so. Very dissapointed in it. Had to send it back.
1,"The company is good, but the product isn't.",I purchased this ice machine for our cottage. It worked great for 2 weeks. I called the company and they sent a new control panel. It is now a month later and the machine doesn't work again. I am very disappointed. I would never buy it again.
3,Good Machine but the LCD screem is fragile,"Buen día, no hablo ingles, compre desde venezuela mi maquina para hacer hielo hace tres meses atras... Es muy buena haciendo su trabajo, no hace ruido, trabaja rápido, el hielo es perfecto para echarlo en la licuadora porque se rompe con facilidad, el único problema es que la pantalla LCD se despegó por la orilla al mes de comprada sin embargo no devolví el producto por no pagar gastos de envío.Deben tener mucho cuidado con la pantalla LCD es muy delicada ."
5,Outstanding,"I purchased one of these three years ago when my old ice maker died. This machine has been running virtually non-stop for three years and performs just like it is advertised. It makes ice fast! And the ice is great for making frozen drinks. Now I'm buying one for my friend. It can't keep up if you're having a party, but if you plan ahead, it will meet all of your ice needs. I highly recommend this item."
4,I would recommend,"We did the cleaning cycle like the directions said to with one exception, we used half the vinegar. The first drop of ice was very weak, maybe the water in the reservoir was too warm? But as it progressed it was thicker and more solid. So far all I've tried was the medium size, and by the fourth drop (40 minutes later) I was very glad I ordered it.The only bad thing is like another reviewer said, the control panel doesn't want to stick in place. I'll probably put some clear tape over the panel to secure it. I bought this for ice not a center piece, but for 200 bucks it should look the part.Bottom line for me, I already recommended it to friends.Update... 12 Dec 2012Over a year old and still works like a champ. I did cover the control panel with some clear tape and haven't had any issues."

4,Dead Air,"This is a great read. Ms Miller has given the reader a fast paced mystery, a thinly veiled and humorous look at Minnesota's former governor and a taste of TV newsrooms."
5,Phenomonal product,I had this product for a couple months and it was great. Unfortunately I tightened the RCA too much and it broke. Still need to find someone to fix that but any how it is a great product I suggest everyone to buy.
4,toooooooooooooo easy,"Although this game is one of my favorite of all time(despite the horrible grapics outside of battle)it was just too easy. At least in dwm2 you had a hard time after completing the regular quest. After starry night in this game it was simply going through warpholes and beating bosses. I beat starry night, the master monster tamer, beat every warphole and got watabou all in under 25 hours. Let me gove every body a hint breed breed breed until you can get a Goldslime and a Jamyrus throw in any other monster and then go to the slime warp got to warp 25 and beat on metabbles you get 22,000 experience per its too easy easy easy easy."
5,NOT A POKEMON RIPOFF,this game is awesome and is a lot more challenging than pokemon. i really like how you can breed monsters to make stronger ones. i use the breeding most. it is cool how at the end of each travelers' gate there is a boss monster that will sometimes come with you.
4,Dragon warrior stuff by D-rex,THis is a very fun game i am really glad i got it. You start out with this slime monster and then you can capture others along the way its cool and makes me chicken slappin happy!
5,"Not Pokémon, but better!!",This game rawks!!! It's better than Pokémon in fact it's way better than Pokémon. Comparing it to Pokémon it's a little munchkin. The bosses are very tricky but they use the same strategy over and over again. I'll give you a tip on who the first boss is; it is a monster that is always healing himself. It is also easier to catch monsters. All you have to do is throw a meat at them and hope they come up after you make them collapse. You can breed in this game too. The only thing that is bad is that you can't trade with friends.
5,Better Than Pokemon,"This shall be the easiest review ever, This Game Is 100 times better than Pokemon."
4,cool in some ways,"dragon warriors is not the same as pokemon its much easy to play in two ways 1- is much fun and you have to play with 5 bootons the only thing that is difficult is that you have to chose the eggs of the monsters,but i think that its an excellent rpg(if you cant buy pokemon by this game)i strongly suggest it."
5,This game rox,"This game is the greatest ever I play very mucho y es muy divertida. I love it because there is so much to do, like beating the individual levels and the master monster tamer and the breeding is actually good and doesnt just make the same monster like pokemon. Pokemons ... worse than my other review. The best monster is DarkDrium, but my faves are GoldSlime, RainHawk, Rosevine, and Mudou. Buy this Game Nowif your reading this i am here on a mission"
5,A great game for the Pokemon mind!,"This game was, in everyway the most greatest kind of RPG on Gameboy Color! If you're a Pokemon fan then you might disagree. But this game takes you in the game and lets you solve all kinds of problems. The sounds of the game are really pretty interesting and the masters and bosses are incredible. This game will keep you satified for a long, long time! The fact of raising monsters and breeding them and combining them into different monsters justed makes you stuck to the game! This is pokemon with more drama and action! You buy items and join with allies to form a team of unbeatable creatures, cute and strong! There are a lot of cute and cuddly monsters and powerful monsters. This game is an interllectual challenge and is very indept. You will have a great experience with this wonderful game and the climax of the game is always happening! Choosing animals and training and trading has never been this interesting! What are you waiting for? Buy it already!"
5,a very cool game,"dragon warrior monsters is a great rpg game. it is about you a boy named terry. a monster steals tou sister the another monster takes you to the kingdom of great tree. the king promises you if you win the starry night tournement you will find you sister back at your house. there are 215 different kinds of monsters each is different. there are different monster families too. to get monsters to come with you you can give them a treat or sometimes they just come with you wit no treats at all. some of theese treats include: porkchop, ribs, beef jerky, or sirlion steak.there are poratls that lead you thru vast mazes there is always aboss at the end of each gate. you can also use certain staffs as weapons like the boltstaff,lavastaff,firestaff,miststaff and so on.you kan also breed your monsters together to got stronger monsters or weeker ones. there are 46,010 different breeding combinations.if i could rate this game between 1 and 10 i wouid give it an 11"
5,This rocks! GET IT!,"Hey there. This game is great. GET IT! I got it and IT RULES. It's totally addicting. It's about a boy whos sister gets kidnapped by a evil monster. You have to train monsters and catchem by getting them to like you by using treats. You defeat people in certain classes to unlock stuff. that's one of the most challenging parts cause you sometimes have to go through them over and over till you beat it but it's fun. The great thing about it is that it's an actual challengeing rpg. I mean it's not hecka hard and gets you stuck in a place where you cant go anywehre like survival kids and its not a ""YOU beat it once and so you can beat it again hecka easily"" like pokemon is. i mean pokemon is a great game but dragon warrior is hecka alot better. the puzzles are a little hard to find and figure out but there not unsolvable. in closing staements this game rules get it and you wont regret it."
1,a bad game,this is another pokemon ripoff dont buy it. i would give it no stars but i had to give it one
5,I love this game!,This game is great. I just keeep playing and creating more monsters and getting more strength. It is really a game that allows you to make choices about what items you need for your monsters and what should be left behind. It is very different from other games where you just get whatever weapon comes your way and fight until the end of the game. This is really about skill and has so many different areas the player can enter and explore. I highly recommend this one.
1,Beware the DVD,This DVD did not work in my DVD/Blueray player. It does not accept DVD-R DVD's. Be sure to check before ordering. Amazon's return policy worked well.
4,Einstein revealed,"This small volume reveals Mr. Einstein as a human being rather than the genius he was. We find he was concerned about finances and worried about money. He was very interested in being credited with his discoveries and had family problems. Overall, for those with an interest in Mr. Einstein, it's certainly worth reading to help in trying tounderstand him.Mr. Einstein is generally credited with the definition of insanity being ""doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result"". The basis of this attribution is Letters to Slovine. There is nothing in this book to authenticate that statement and the quote belongs to Ms. Rita Mae Brown who probably paraphrased a section from a early !980s Narcotic Anonymous pamphlet."
4,This book is gorgeous...but not for the young!,"This book is more like a big, beautiful coffee table book than a book for children or teens. That doesn't make it not worth buying...but parents who don't want their children knowing about Paul losing his virginity, 'knee tremblers' or prellies...might want to stay away from this one.But...for those who love gorgeous books about the Fab Four should definitely invest in this book!"
1,disappointing,"The pictures are great. Forget the rest. This is a poorly-written book. The paragraphs do not flow into each other. I felt it was far too slanted towards making us believe that Lennon was a negative character, and that his relationship with Yoko was basically just ""bickering"". I don't agree with this at all and feel that other books and interviews with actual people who knew Lennon give a much different picture than the one presented here. Go to the Library and borrow a copy to flip through the pictures. Don't buy this book.On another note: Lennon the New York Years is a fantastic book that I highly recommend."
3,Why Bomb?,"Why Bomb? Why Moslem?This will irritate them. only few of them who did that. and millions of others are peaceful. Kureishi's works are sensational. But his works miss point of moderate Moslem (cf. dewi candraningrum soekirno's review).As a Moslem, why Hanif do not explore the beautiful side of Islam as a religion. I really want to read it."
3,Good but does not work with Treo!!!,Watched looked great! Fit and feel was amazing. Excellent quality! However the bluetooth features were not compatible with my treo. The sole downfall to the watch.
3,good show but...,Had to take this one to a friends house to watch it.The DVD does not play in all DVD playersbut over all the show does show the b-52 and its uses since its beginings.
4,Saga as a trio,"This album is not their best, but not bad either. People say this is their return to their early progressive roots... I say that's about 50% right. I think it is a good transition from their previous album (Wildest Dreams, their most commercial album and not one of my favorites) to the next album (The security of Illusion, one of my personal favorites, and a good combination of their progressive roots with their new found modern style).It's a great attempt, but the band is never the same without drummer Steve Negus and keyboardist/vocalist/clarinet player Jim Gilmour."
2,Ahhh..... Ok...,"To me this album needed to be re-titled Wildest Dreams Part 2. It's ok. It does have some good songs: How Do I look, Giant, As I Am. But it has one of the worst songs in the history of time. I present to you The Nineties. The sound is identical to Wildest Dreams and so are the songs. I own the original version so I can't comment on the remaster deal but as far as the song quality... it's kinda lame."
5,One of the best ever baseball books read by me!,Don't hesitate to buy this marvelous book. It told with an exact and actually atmosphere everything about NYC baseball... when the Giants were called 'Polo Grounders' and the Dodgers 'Da Bums'. The dramatic move also is well explained.
3,Bug in autogenterated request for Review software,"Amazon cancelled this order because the supplier didn't have it. I should not keep being asked to review the purchase (when there wasn't one.)I would still like to obtain the battery, btw.thank youBoyd Norris"
5,Be True to Thine Self,A splendid tale of one man's journey towards self acceptance/discovery and the journey it takes to get there. Life's highs and lows are explored in a very entertaining manner. Creatively written using several different types of style.....This is a must read for all that care about the human condition and how we become (eventually)who we are......And end up liking ourselves because of our journey. A definite 10+ highly recommended!
4,Good Book!,"Good first-person account of the Falklands war [at least the naval part of it] by the naval forces commander. Seemed a bit dry to me, and Woodward seems pretty stiff, but the subject matter saves it."
4,One Hundred Days: The Memoires of the Falklands Battle Group...,The book was received in excellent condition. The story is well written and very interesting. Would recommend it highly.
5,Required reading for anyone studying naval history,I read this book as a midshipman in my efforts toward professional development as a future naval officer. This is an EXCELLENT book. Admiral Woodward provides insight into some very important lessons learned from the Falklands War - the first time the Royal Navy went to war since WWII and using weapons systems that had not been tested in battle and the first war in the age of instant satellite news networks. I couldn't put the book down.
4,A quick and enjoyable read,"Let me start by saying that I try not to inflate my ratings like so many on amazon.com, so this is actually a very positive rating.Crosby presents no original research here, but he does do a marvelous job of pulling together the work of others to bolster his argument that it was the shift in Europeans viewing reality in quanitificational concepts rather than qualitative ones that laid the intellectual groundwork for their global expansion. Fortunately, in presenting the work of others Crosby has an eye equally attuned to the more entertaining moments in the shift to the age of quantification as to the more crucial. He is also a highly entertaining writer. The result is perhaps the easiest-to-read work of pre-modern history that I have encountered. Not heavy duty stuff, but an extraordinarily pleasant way to spend a few hours."
4,An overview of the shaping of a technological world.,"Crosby does a fantastic job covering a vast change in the overall society changes from 1250-1600. For the amount of vast knowledge packed in you'd think the book would be 3,000 pages. He brings us an interesting approach to the actual birth and uprise of modern techonology, arts and literature as we know it."
5,Quite simply brilliant....,"As you get older, it becomes a rare thing indeed to stumble across an author who reignites the passion for reading that you had as a youth. Graham Joyce in general, and ""Requiem"" in particular has done so for me. What can I say, he has blended complex characters, in a fascinating setting, and twisted it all subtly with a strong dose of fantasy to create one of the most profoundly engaging and thought provoking novels I have ever read. The incredibly powerful images and ideas of this novel have haunted my dreams. I, as a reader, will pay Mr. Joyce the highest compliment I know how to bestow upon an author...I am profoundly grateful, and please, please write more."
3,Unique story,"I enjoyed the first half of this book but, started getting bored with the characters half way through. However, because of the unique story I'll bet it will hold most people's interest. The descriptions of the 'strange sightings' are wonderful. The reader never knows what's real and what's not real. Taking place in Israel makes this story even more fascinating."
5,Finaly a book worth looking for,Dark fantasy? Horror? Whatever! Joyce is the name you should remember. Probably the best book of 'magic realism' of the 90s. How could the judges of the World Fantasy Award overlooked this seminal piece of fiction???
3,Twice burned,"This is my second try with Joyce, having read Some Kind of Fairy Tale. He pulls me in with intriguing mystery and baffling events and Joyce has a profound gift for compelling sentences and beautiful plotting. But he is done in by his endings, which I find prosaic and unsatisfying. He seems to charge toward them with simple minded wrap ups that shatter any credulity you had about his tale. I don't need a happy ending, or a neat and tidy ending. Still, I'd like a little wonder left to ponder. Very sorry Mr. Graham, you're a good writer, but your endings are lacking. And for that reason I've ended up feeling cheated of my time. I won't try again."
2,WHERE WAS THE FOCUS? JERUSALEM? SCROLL FRAGMENTS?,"Blech. A bunch of psychobabble about some guy's unresolved feelings of guilt over his wife's death. I was so interested in the mystery surrounding the interpretation of the dead sea scrolls, but there was very little devoted to the thrill behind that subplot. Disappointing. The promise of more about the secret of the scrolls and who was after it kept my interest until the end, but it went nowhere and was very disappointing."
2,Da Vinci Code w/ very explicit sex scenes,"In the interest of full disclosure, I wasn't able to finish this book. I put up with several explicit sex scenes before finally putting it down due to the explicit sex with a kid scene. Very disturbing. If you've read the Da Vinci code you'll be familiar with the basic plot line of Jesus was married and the Chrisitian church covered it up so they could set up a religion. If these things don't bug you then it isn't a bad book, but I'm submitting the review I wish was here before I bought the book."
4,"Excellent service, book in mint condition","The book I bought from Eric was in excellent condition, plus it arrived only 3 days after I had purchased it! Great service, perfect product!"
5,Songo's first CD is great!,"Songo is great! I've been waiting for their first CD for a while, and it exceeds all hopes. Anyone looking for a great new band with an exciting new sound need look no further."
5,Works great,This product does exactly what it is supposed to. It is well built and seems like it will last along time. It is made out of metal instead of plastic like most things now a days.
4,Helps remove solder from PCB vias.,"I had trouble getting solder out of holes on circuit boards after I made a mistake with a desoldering bulb. This almost completely clears the holes. Much easier to use than a bulb and gets clogged less. I would prefer more suction, but it's great considering the cost. I would recommend this to anyone who solders."
5,Fluid Perfume,"The bottle is a little bit messy with the leaking fluid, but it comes in a plastic tube you can store it in, which minimizes the mess. The product itself is just fine, and seeing as this has been discontinued, it gives her a little bit of an extension before she has to find another perfume she likes. It's too bad H20 discontinued this."
5,Great insight into child behavior,Louise Bates Ames give a wonderful detail of the traits we can expect from our toddlers through 10 year olds as their personalities develope with their complex minds. as they change into ten year olds. The characteristics she descibes in this book are extremely beneficial insights into the young minds we are in charge of forming. The benefit of this insight is very helpful for the new and seasoned parent as it gives answers to what to expect and many helpful suggestions for what to do to get the responses we are lookng for in our children. Her study of children's traits is extensive and complete with useful examples of actions to be taken and reactions not to use. I highly recommend this book to all parents.
5,Awesome,I love this album. It is one of those cds that you can put in and listen to every track. Very relaxing and calming after a long day.
5,Extremely Helpful,"I am a recent missionary appointee with TWR. Before reading this book, I was really dreading support raising. But after going through the scripture passages, on how raising support is biblical, I started getting more excited. I really like how the Author spends time talking about taking care of your supporters while you are out on the field as well.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is raising support."
2,"Funding Your Ministry: An In-dept, Biblical Guide for Successfully Raising Personal Support",Funding Your Ministry is a God-send! Scott Morton covers many questions I had as I began raising support for the first time. I appreciate the Bible studies he included in the appendix that helped me clarify my thinking. This is the step-by-step guide I needed. I'm very grateful to Crown Ministry adviser who recommended it.I will definitely take this book with me when I move to Asia next month. The advice on writing newsletters and keeping my supporters informed and involved in the ministry will come in handy.
2,Some good but...,"I, also, have been a misisonary for 25 years. We have served in a foreign country and in the US. We have always had our needs met and we have never had to ask someone face to face for support. I cannot agree with his methods. I would feel extremely uncomfortable if someone confronted me the way he wants me to confront others!There are some good things in the book. He has some very good tips on writing prayer letters; what to do and what not to do. There are many good ideas on how to treat your supporters and I am keeping my book because of these good points, but I am ignoring the parts about raising support!I am glad this method of support-raising works for the author, but I do not see it as being the way God wants us or, anyone for that matter, to raise support. It seems to me to be very much like a business and not a ministry! I would encourage you instead, to read a good biography on George Meuller who NEVER asked anyone but God for money and support!"
4,Just what it says,"This book is THE book to purchase if you are venturing into the world of raising support. Simple, effective, practical, easy to read. I highly recommend it."
5,Great book for fundraisers,"This is an excellent book for those in ministry who are not natural ""fundraisers"". Highly recommended"
5,good so far,"good from I've read so far. I appreciate some of the attitude helps. It's not all about the technique, but a lot about our perspective and attitude approaching fundraising."
4,Greatest Funding to Date,This is just what I needed. I was greatly encouraged and it delt with some difficulties that kept me back that no one else has been able to help me with. Time after time I have shared my difficulties and not one person has been able to give a solution. This book did just that. Thank you Scott
5,"Biblical, practical, the best","Simply speaking, this is the one book I recommend. We used this for missionary fundraising and had excellent results. It was given to us by our mission agency, WorldVenture (formerly Conservative Baptist International).I've done a bit of research and some publishing on Paul's fundraising methods. I was very pleased to see that Morton did not simply give the reader practical tips, but actually sought to prove his case (successfully) by the apostolic model. Some Christian workers have the idea that everyone is called to be a George Muller, and that we need only pray for support. Others send out hundreds of letters and get almost no response. Morton deals with these issues and others and analyzes the theology and practice that lie behind various models.But this is not simply a theology of fundraising - he helps you develop what to say, how to present yourself, and so forth."
4,Practical,Very practical and hands-on in its approach.Chapters are laid out in a fashion that allows for easy reading and review. I will use this book for future reference.
5,Sweeeetness!!!!!!,"have you been searching for the best adventure of gaming history, an immortal among others that will keep you on the edge of your seat through the entire experience? Than look no further, for a, b, c, and all of the above are found in this game. A must buy!!!!!!!"
2,i think i missed the boat,i like to hear people read stuff they wrote and sometimes hear other people read stuff that other people wrote but this takes it a little bit too far because i think ecm thinks that they would take the lady poet vocal to another level and they sort of fell short.
2,Very poor wireless,"This laptop is compact and stylish but not much else. Beware of the wireless ability especially. It contains an RALink RT2500 internal 801.11b/g card. Places in my house where my old Dell laptop got excellent or good reception, this one got poor or bad. Where my old Dell got poor, I could not get on my wireless network at all. I ended up returning it for a Centrino laptop, which have much better Intel wireless cards."
4,better then expected,i read a lot of reviews and was thinking of returning this but it worked alot better then i thought it would had it almost 3 months withou a problemthe wireless signal strenght was not good out of the box but once i updated through windows update it doubled and i am getting the same signal as my dell picture is great very fast cpu does not get as hot as i thought it would very light and appealingonly bad thing is definitly the speakers
5,"Excellent, especially for the price!","I work for a small moving company (4WeHelp) and we decided we could save a lot of money by changing out own fluids. Since we don't have a bay or lift of any type we needed a drain pan that could fit under a truck and catch 5-7 gallons of fluids. This thing is perfect, we can change two trucks oil before we have to empty it. The drain cap screws on tight and it has wheels and sturdy handles all the way around that makes it easy to move when full.Pros:Easy to useCloses tightLarge capacityWheels and handles make it easy to moveCons:None"
4,Great Game,"Great game from not a very famous company, TalonSoft. I think it's cool because, as in real life, you can ride in almost every vehicle you see. The vehicles are the best part about this game, while the weapons aren't anything new, the vehicle riding is very realistic. As in if you ride a motorcycle over a hill at high speed, it flies through the air and violently lands on the ground. The bad part about this game is that you can't save it. If you die, you can't load a saved game, you've gotta play it over again.This game may not be a computer gaming wonder, but you will have fun with it."
3,not NEARLY as funny as i'd remembered,"maybe my 10 year old brain hadn't quite developed back then but, here I am now pushing 26 & i could barely STAND to sit through disc 1 of this.made a nice lil profit when i re-sold it back on amazon tho...the only reason i gave it 3 stars :)"
5,Bout time!,"""What the hell are YOU starin' at!!??""All I can say it's it's about damn time they released this show on DVD!! Can't wait to get seasons 3&4."
4,Great book but way too expensive for what you get,"First of all I love this book, the images are fantastic! Second - the book is a paperback that originally sold for $19.95 so who knows why it is now selling new for over $50 - out of print maybe (the price is why it lost a star)? Anyway - it is full of fantastic Victorian scraps that you can use for your craft projects. My advice is borrow it from the library, or buy it used. I think the used prices are also way too high for what you get, but I guess it depends on how much you want the book/images...which is why I sucked it up and spent the money...go figure :-/"
1,DISAPPOINTING PRODUCT,"The ""hairs"" come out very easily. Also, if you need to wrap a ponytail more than twice, it doesn't lay right. This was a classic ""seemed like a good idea"" product, but it has not been well engineered. I returned it."
1,Not the original,"It's not authentic Tonytail, it's a poorly done look-alike. It's a low quality product that features metal - and tarnished, above all! - parts which can damage your hair. Very disappointed!"
2,Tonytail Ponytail Wrap,The plastic pieces that hold the hair shows when you use the ponytail. Those need to be smaller and you would have to have very thick hair for them not to show.
2,Wish could return,The color does not match (which I didn't necessarily unexpect) but size does not work for my hair. Needs to be smaller or larger.
4,Fine for us,"My daughters also dance and needed to wrap their hair quickly for competitions. Two competitions down, one to go and three recitals. All holding up so far! Try again other dance mom ;-)"
1,Save your money!,I recently purchased 3 Tonytails for my daughter. She is a dancer and uses them for competition. All three of them BROKE before we could get them in her hair - one was still in the package! Save your money!!
5,Very well Organized,"I am sick and tired of wiccan books who don't teach you about wicca, the ethics, philosophy or morals. Just how to cast a spell. Many don't even teach how to cast one properly. Other books have false storries about deities.Katherine Clark is different. She has large amount of experiences and her Book covers all grounds. If you are sick and tired of buying 20 books to learn nothing. Get this book. This book covers all in full detail, has refence side and even explains the many things wiccans should and should not do if they want a healthy wiccan experience. I'm pretty new and I gave most of my wiccan books away due to poor writting.This book is a must, it's a ""How-to-do"" ""what-to-do"" ""Reasons you should do or don't book"". If you are one person who is afraid of getting lost, and you love wicca and the Irish way and love a good well research book, This is it!!!"
2,Wish not full filled,"I had great hopes that this would be Irish Spirituality, instead I found yet another book of Wicca with a slight (very slight) Celtic flavor. The only redeeming points are an occasional piece of poetry or turn of phrase that may work in another setting."
5,An Enjoyable Experience,"I usually don't write reviews, but feel that I have to comment on this book, and a prior review. I am not a Wiccan. I'm not a Druid, either. I obtained this book because I was interested in Wiccan rituals and practices. At no point was I mislead into thinking this had any association with Druids. I was fairly confident that it was a Wiccan Book of Shadows based on old Irish myth. People in the pagan community are fairly much aware that ""Irish Wicca"" is a blending. Old family traditions and folk ways find a comfortable home within the Wiccan framework.I read the book. The rituals were not claimed to be older than the 20th century, although they sprang from older roots. The rituals were clear, interesting and beautiful. The aspects of the gods and goddesses were based on the old myths and serious research. This book did not disappoint me at all. It was what it claimed to be: a Book of Shadows. It's a good, practical reference book, and I enjoyed it."""
3,Somewhat disappointed,"Being the avid fan of horror that I am, I decided to buy this blind after reading a few good reviews online, and well, I wish I would have rented.First of all, these movies, although watchable, are clearly meant for TV. They were released in Spanish TV, which can be more lax than American channels, but still this volume is clearly meant for the small screen. We get some decent frights here and there but nothing really out there. I probably only truly enjoyed two chapters, A Christmas Tale and the Spectre. All the others, including the Jaime Balaguero (whose involvement was one of the main reasons I bought this in the first place) flick ""To Let"" were an utter disappointment.I'd rent this is you have to, but instead try and see REC (by MR. Balaguero), one of the most awesome and frightening movies ever."
1,6 FILMS TO PUT YOU ASLEEP,"I am a avid horror fan, and when i saw the cover , I was ready for Masters of Horror type films, or even a Horrorfest experience, But i got neither from this collection. The packaging is decieving, it leads you to believe you will be scared, but your not. the first film The Blame was about a lesbian doctor who perfoms abortions and the fetus dissappears?a REAL fREIND, about a young girl who hangs out with Leatherface, and other movie monsters, while her mother who is a nurse also prostitutes herself on the side ?I glimpsed a few other of the tales in the collection and didn't even bother to finish watching any of them.I totally wasted my money and my time."
3,Different and unexpected,"If you've been watching horror for the past few years, you'll know that Spain is really producing some interesting films. These are no exception. They are all different and maybe you could even say uneven. I really like ""A Real Friend"" and think that's worth the price of admission alone. A definite must for fans of ""Masters of Horror""."
5,Much superior to Masters of Horrors...,"These films are all great, some are even amazing. I want more of this.Watch out for Spain in the future."
5,Entertaining and artful!,This is a great collection to have. My favorite film in this collection is Regresa A Moira. It was filmed beautifully and the actors were superb. I wish films like these would become more popular and widely spread. Get your copy today; it is definitely worth it!
3,poor packaging,"I ordered this tank and received it on time but there was a huge dent on the end of the tank. Thankfully, Amazon has an amazing return policy and took it back postage paid by UPS. I just had to find a local UPS store. I opted to have the tank replaced instead of refunded and the second tank also had a dent but not nearly as bad. I decided to keep this tank because since there is absolutly no packing foam between the box and the tank on either side, I figured the third tank would be dented also. Amazon has an awesome return policy, therefore I will keep doing business with them. Tractor supply has this tank for $120."
4,Blitz Fuel Station works for me,"I bought this as a portable fuel tank for camping with a generator and ATVs. One thing the details don't tell you when buying this is that it is not recommended as a ""Portable"" fuel tank... nice that they tell you before you buy it... NOT. But I use it anyway and just rigged up a grounding wire (recommended) to my truck. The unit uses gravity flow to work, therefore the bottom of the tank must be higher than anything you fill. My pickup sits high so it works... if you just have a standard pickup, even an adult ATV/Quad could be questionable. Filled with fuel this tank is heavy, so once filled and in your pickup, you'll need the Hulk to lift it any higher if needed.Again as I stated, it works for me, but I could see how this may not work for everyone. The quality is good and I have had no problems with it at all.Happy Pumping :-)"
4,Works great but safety and convenience work against eachother,Assembly was easy. The nozzle is easy to use. I'm not sure how long the hose will last in sunlight. Too early to tell. Materials otherwise seem apropriate for the use. Only problem is grounding. It is designed to be mounted permanently to avoid the static electricity that builds up and can spark when filling it. I don't want to have it permantntly mounted at the back of my pickup bed because I use the pickup for other things. It is too small to justify mounting on a trailer. I anticipate I will come up with some kind of grounding strap or mounting quick release. I have filled it once with great caution and it is wonderfully handy for filling the lawnmower.
4,Heavy but handy,"I resealed all of the conections (that was the biggest compliant I read) with a pliable sealant (instead of teflon tape) for gas and deisel fuel and no leaks. One I use for 110 race gas, one for premium gas, and the other for deisel all are working great."
4,The Blitz fuel station,"Great quality product, good price, could use longer hose for mounting on wall or shelf. I have only used this product about one month and is much easier then lifting fuel cans all the time. Would recommend for any homeowner who has mowers to fill."
3,Gex 3 Deep Pocket Geko is.....,"Gex 3 on Gameboy IS a cool game, but is very challenging. Hard and confusing at first, this game builds up frustration and makes you want to put it down for a while. When you get back to it, you figure out the problem and beat that level with a sigh of realief. I recommend this game to someone over the age of 6 because of hard and confusing it gets, and also because Gex has a big imagination. Gex (which is you) gets zaped into different TV shows. You must capture all 4 channels hidden in the show to win that TV. One TV is 1 level, nearly 30 levels in all. Each Show is different, like Tut TV (Egyptian, find 3 lost arks) or Mars (Space, blast off 5 rockets) or Holiday TV (defeat an evil Santa and elves) and wild west (visit the Largest Mound of Poop on a donkey). Gex talks back to you sometimes, wears outragious costumes, K.O.s enimies with a deadly tail whips, and acts as cool as a geko can get."
4,good game!!!!!,"This game is a fun game, but it is not so easy at the start this game is not good for children that dont understand stuf(ages 9+)"
2,There is a better textbook than this one.,"I am an instructor of an introductory course on mechanics of materials. I used this textbook by Gere and another textbook with the same title by Roy R. Craig, Jr. as my references. I find the textbook by Craig has a much better content structure than this text. For example, this text splits Stress Concentrations, Energy Methods and Indeterminate Problems into subsections of different chapters which is rather annoying. These topics should be a complete chapter of itself for clarity."
1,The Most Confusing Mechanics Book Around!,"This book is awful. The writing style is terrible. I think the author needs to learn how to speak english. Here's a quote from the book:""Having found the principal stresses and their directions for an element in plane stress, we now consider the determination of the maximum shear stresses and the planes on which they act.""Instead he SHOULD have written:""We will now find the maximum shear stresses.""The whole book is like this. It is far too wordy. This book could be a lot smaller if the author didn't try to make everything so complicated."
4,Extended Battery Review,It is nice to have extended life on the battery but the size is way too large. It creates a problem when travelling.
4,Decent solution,"I bought this battery for my husband's HP nc8430 battery.Positive aspects:1. Extends the laptop power to ~ 9 hours2. Slightly raises the angle of the laptop so typing is easier3. It came with its own battery power charger (similar to the laptop power supply BUT with lower power spec)4. Can hotswap in or out5. Can charge in 90 minutesNegative aspects:1. Can be little bit pricey2. Spec says up to 10 hours; in reality expect 8 to 9 hours3. Adds few more pounds to the laptop carry weightOverall, worth the money in my opinion. If you want to see some picture, goto trendydads dotcom."
1,"OK watch, LOUSY SERVICE!","Tissot is owned by Omega. They have ONE service center in the USA. According to my jeweler, they sometimes have gone on strike for up to 6 months. Every time I have had to send my watch back for ANY service, it has taken over 2 months to get it back. The last time was 10 weeks and counting. If you like to buy a watch to wear from time to time ONLY...then go ahead and buy one. The battery WILL run down, and you will have to send it on in, for more $$$ and wait and see if it comes back in 2 months!"
2,Tissot Titanium T-Touch Problems,"I purchased a Tissot Titanium T-Touch in September 2007 and this is the 3rd time the watch broke on me. 1st time the T-Touch did not last 1 month and stopped working. They send it to the Factory. After I received it back, it broke down again after about 45 days and I received the watch back after about 4 months. so today, after having had the watch for 14 months, it again broke down and the touch screen does not respond any more.Needles to say, I wonder how long they will take this time to repair it and what their excuse will be for the failures.Too Bad .... I REALLY REALLY LIKE THE FEATURES OF THIS WATCH ... :-("
1,Breaks more than any item I owned.,"I have owned this watch for nearly two years and as cool as it is its a piece of junk. I know that not everyone shares my sentiment but I have had this on my arm for only about 20% of the time while the remaining time was spent at the repair facility. I have experienced every possible way this thing can break:1) LCD screen goes blank.2) Compass starts to spin out of control.3) twice I had the touch screen always go to the altimeter no matter where pressedSo four times at the repair shop, missing for 2-3 months each. I now can tell you that I hate my watch which I have waited for so long. I used to wear it proudly now I don't want to press any buttons on it from fear of another breakage."
1,Not so spiffy,"My wife bought me this watch as a Christmas present in 2006. So far, I've had to send it back for service twice. First, the digital barometer quit, then the compass was stuck pointing at the ""6"". I sent it in, and it came back in about 6 weeks. Three days later, the hands started spinning and rotating through all the digital functions. After a few days of this the watch died completely.I wouldn't buy this item again."
4,Tissot T-Touch Titanum,"Great watch. Looks good. Feels good on. Quality has been excellent, so far. I only have two complaints, one minor and one moderate. Minor: When you touch the face to change functions you get fingerprints all on the crystal. Moderate: It has no backlight--makes it tough to impossible to read in the dark."
4,warranty,"5 stars for the watch, less one for lack of warranty. Be aware that most manufacturers' warranties are valid only if the item is purchased through an authorized seller. Not all (if any) Amazon sellers are authorized sellers. Do not expect Tissot to honor the 3 year warranty that another reviewer mentioned unless you purchase from an authorized seller. For more info, see the Tissot website www.tissot.ch"
2,Problems with the compass,"Hi,I bought one T-toch a year and a half ago. I loved this watch. I'm a gadget guy and to have everything in one... but unfortunately I hade problems with the compass. The fist time, 6 months ago, I took it as it was under guarantee and they replaced it. Now, six months latter, with a new one... same thing. I thought it was my fault because I travel a lot and I did put the watch through the x-rays, but with the second one, I never put it... so they have faulty compass...."
5,My most worn timepiece,"I have some rather exotic watches, but this watch is the one I have worn most over the last 2 years. I don't take particular care in protecting it, but it polishes up beautifully. The sapphire crystal is scratch free with only minor brush like scratches on the clasp.I bought it because of its promised durability and have not been the least bit disappointed. A great long term daily wear watch.Update Sept 2010Finally had to replace the battery last year. 5+ is not bad. Problem was that a local jeweler replaced the battery and must have broken the contact off ad it ran only 2 weeks and stopped altogether. Had to send back to factory for refurb and cleaniing, which cost 330.00!!! Yikes!But it is now back on my arm daily."
4,"werewolves, vampires, shapeshifters, oh my",This was my first read by Angela Knight. The book was a fun read. It is a gothic read so be prepared to envision some gore. I like her writing and will probably try another book from her.
1,Kaz Bennett,I had never read any books by this author before and won't again - poorly written with too many genres combined into one book and a very sketchy plot full of holes- I didn't even finish this book and found the characters very unconvincing.
3,s'OK,"The book was OK good. I am a fan of Ms Knights books. A little more follow through. The female lead was supposed to be magic resistant (But Llyr bound her with magic chains?), and strong enough to take care of herself and protect humans from Magekind (did not seem so). She is a 7 foot werewolf but as happens too often in romance novels, they are not consistent with the female lead. You can be strong and not be bitchy. And enough bondage already scenes already."
4,Enjoyable..................,"After reading Master of the Night and reading the short novella from Bite I decided to give Angela another try. This book to me was so much better than Master of the Night,Lyr and Diana were so good together that I had sort of wished that they teamed together in Law Enforcement. This book blended the sex theme and the conflict theme in a more balanced way. I'm not sure what her next book is about but I highly recommend this book."
3,Cutest Bib I've Ever Seen!!,"I loved this bib the first time I saw it, organic, spill-proof, bright colours and VERY CUTE!! bought it for DS for Christmas even though it's pricey but feels high quality. I've been using it everyday now since December and only hand wash with soapy water and wring dry. Now the area around the neck is a bit discoloured? I'm thinking the protective coating came off? it is quite noticeable and starting to smell funky? Going to try putting it in the washer and hang to dry.ETA: After machine washing and hanging dry, it still looks the same. Now more areas of the bib is discoloured :( I would not recommend it now, too bad.ETA again: The company has great customer service!!"
4,A good read.,"It's a nice book, but there are some mistakes and sometimes it's boring. A good free book."
3,Fun for little children and older Smurf lovers.,"Three apples high. This game is too easy to be called a ""good game,"" but as someone who loves Smurfs it was decently entertaining. In the cut scenes, which can also be played in French and Spanish, the Smurfs have British accents rather than the familiar Hanna-Barbarra voices (sort of a dissapointment). For a non-violent, but exciting game I would recommend this for younger children. Besides without the TV show how will a new generation learn about my favourite blue guys. :)"
2,OK,"The ""It's a Piece of Cake"" level is was too easy, I think it might be for toddlers and in the ""It's No Picnic"" level I can't get past the first level because I can't find out how to get past the huge plant. When I try to jump over him he eats me. Rent this game before buying it and if you get past the plant can ya tell me how?"
1,Zanzibar Tarab Vol 1,"Not a good compilation, they are a lot of much better cd of Akwan Safaa tarab music out there."
5,Toppik - A miracle product,"My hair was thinning on the back side of my head, and there was nothing I could do about it. I tried toppik and to my surprise it was as good as anything I could hope for. I found that by using my wifes small make up brush and cutting it flat, I could dip in the container and dip on the thinning spots necessary. Lastly, I lightly brushed in the direction that I normally comb, and it looks as though I have replaced all the thinning areas with hair. I couldn't be happier, and would recommend it to anyone with thinning hair.Al"
3,"It's Alright.. But, works best along with other concealers!","The product works best when lightly sprinkling from the vertex towards the frontal crown while using a hair spray. For the hairline, dermmatch is preferred."
3,Could be sturdier,"I bought these to replace my ancient ones that have been breaking from old age. These are the same size but--- The actual clips are very strong and have a cute daisy pattern. However, the hooks are extremely thin and I wonder how they will handle wet items. My hooks are used to dry lingerie and microfiber cloths. I hang them from a towel bar, the frame of my shower door and the decorative molding above my doors. These new ones will only hang properly from a towel bar; they bend awkwardly from anything else. My old hooks are 1/8in. wide. These new ones are barely half that thick, so you can understand my skepticism. I will keep these, but I should have made a Target run. Would not buy these hooks again."
2,large Laundry hooks,"I am sure they are fine hooks however I wanted some for travel and found them to be to big for my needs. I travel very light, carry on only, and am gone for up to one month, Given that the hooks are not small enough. sorry"
4,just right,"These hooks are just what we needed for washcloths in the shower, hanging items to air dry, and lots of other uses, limited only by your imagination. They got here on time. They are plastic, but seem solid and well made. Very happy with them."
1,Fox Run Laundry Hooks,"I wish these were higher-quality. Unfortunately most of them are already broken, and the only thing I use them for is hanging a washcloth in a gym locker. The clips come apart easily and can't be reassembled."
3,Not like what I have.,"I thought these would be a durable as the ones I have, but are cheaply made. They are only good for hanging pantyhose and nylon socks, cotton knee high soucks might be too heavy and will make the hook bend."
2,Handy item,I have used this type of hanger for many years. The ones that I own are very sturdy and the hook is thick. I bought these to send to college with one of my children. The hook on these is very thin and easily bent. I don't expect these to last long and will not purchase this brand again.
2,Poor quality,"I have been woodworking for 40 years, and have dozens of clamps in my shop, but none have ever slipped the way these Scott Phillips clamps do.If you don't get the mechanism ""just so,"" they'll slip. Not fun during a carcase glue-up, as I just found out!I thought it was me, but a quick switch to a Bessey and I was in business. Thank goodness for plenty of clamps...just not these..."
3,"OK, but disappointing compared to their other work","I love the work of Sharon and Tom Curtis. From THE WINDFLOWER to SUNSHINE AND SHADOW to LIGHTNING THAT LINGERS they go from strength to strength. However, in THE TESTIMONY, I feel they produced an adequate work, but it left me thinking chapters were missing. There is very little of the chemistry-filled interaction that makes scenes between past protagonists so memorable. Secondary characters, usually fascinating people in their own right were given a mention and not much else. I'd love to read an expanded version of this story someday."
4,Guaifenesin,seems to work as well as the 600mg mucinex. just a little bit harder to swollow as its not coated like mucinex.
3,Shipping,"I am not reviewing the product, but rather the shipping. Product came as ordered, but in a USPS Priority Mail shipping box with twocontainers of tablets rolling around loose in the box. Although theproduct was not damaged, it would seem a no-brainer that any parcelshould include packing material to secure the contents."
3,Ambivalence,"I read this book for my senior seminar class while studying abroad in Rome. Right now I am of mixed feelings about it. Often I found it to be very dry, and uninspiring. There were times when the book seemed to be just a collection of quotes, followed by strings of names and dates. The author also repeated himself frequently.However, the book raises important points about the history of American policy towards Europe since World War II. Particulary important in this time of heightened anti-American sentiment is the fact that after WWII the Europeans actually wanted the U.S. to remain in their countries militarily, as only the Americans were in a position to provide security against the Soviets and a possibly aggressive Germany.I would only recommend this book for those seriously interested in foreign policy. It is not for those with a passing fancy in politics."
4,Clothes Hamper,"When I viewed this item, there was only one review and it wasn't encouraging. I went ahead and ordered this hamper anyway, swayed by the description which claimed that it was made out of recycled metal.It is a perfect size for an apartment-tall and skinny, with enough room for two loads. I was satisfied with the quality and had no problems assembling it. A good deal for the price."
3,"Enjoyable, for anyone who knows cars...","Surprisingly, one of the best parts had nothing to do with the title, but the author's musings on the car industry and manufacturing in general. It's a fun read, especially for anyone who obsesses on cars, or owns a classic. It convinced me without doubt that there is no way I'd ever build one of these things myself, and some pictures would have been appreciated. But overall I enjoyed it, and it got me thinking..."
4,"We disagree on a lot of issues, but it is still a good book","Chris T. of Seven & Elans recommended this nook to me. As a future 7 owner I could not pass it by. Interestingly the 7 building parts were the parts I did not enjoy that much - the thoughts about the history of the car and the changes it made to the world, manufacturing and everything were interesting.I find that I disagree with the author on many subjects and agree with some - I am however happy I read this book because it provided interesting food for thought."
5,"Captivating. I'd call it ""the Zen of the Roadster""","I can't remember the last time a read a book this quickly.Quite captivating. For anyone planning to build a Roadster or Caterham, this is a must have. Perfect balance between ""Zen"", technicals and why.Roadster takes you into the suspense of the mental journey of not just building the car, but exploring the reasons why, while at the same time providing most valuable insight for those planning to build one.More than anything it makes clear why you'd have to build rather than just buy this particular car to fully capture it's intent or Zen.What is more important about this book is that it raises the question of skill versus determination, as well as the rationalization of any action or commitment. This one sits next to Pirsig's Zen of motorcycle maintenance on my shelf."
1,A lemon,Its rather unfortunate that such a great little sportscar would be burdend with such pretentious tripe. It is unfortunate that the AMC Pacer is not available as a kit. Mr Goodrich's clunky style would be more appropriately directed at the assembly of such a monstrosity.
5,Tiny,"Tiny and perfect. Served its purpose as a name tag embellishment for a Model United Nations conference. Very small, though."
2,Early television that no longer interests,"I love watching early tv but this show is dated and no longer holds much interest. One viewer asks to see an octopus. Why would anyone do this? Well, this is 1952, television is new, and the Discovery channel is still 45 years in the future. Unless you lived near a major aquarium, this might be your only chance to see an octopus. Other requests include third rate vaudeville acts, a song from from Al Jolson's brother, seeing an eskimo build an igloo (since that takes too long, we see him put one block of ice on an igloo), etc. Boring"
5,"Different and Oh, so Delicious","If this book were a gourmet meal, I would have to rate it with a five-star rating. Every line moves you onto the next. Each successive line lead you deeper into what everyone experiences at one time or another: anger, guilt, hopelessness and forgiveness.You come away from The House of Gentle Men wanting to search your own life. You are looking for the destroyed places that must be rebuilt with love. But this is not a syrupy book. In some way, it is a book that burns your hand with misplaced guilt, anger and temptation.It is a must read. It will leave you looking for more books of the same caliber."
5,Memorable first novel,"This is one of the most unusual and memorable Southern novels to come along in a long time; word-of-mouth in our community is sending House of Gentle Men up the charts! Kathy's prose is lyrical and hauntingly descriptive, and her characters altogether unique. This is a writer we'll hopefully hear much, much more from..."
5,A TREASURED DISCOVERY!,"As a voracaious reader, I am always thrilled when I find a book that introduces me to a fresh new style; this story is spring time in it's most glorious green. The eccentric tale is an adult fable and an allegory wrappped together in lyrical prose that flows with the power of a raging river at times, and a soothing babbling creek at other's. The mythical, yet marred, characters leave their imprint on your soul as you become entrenched in their personalities......judging one moment; forgiving the next. The haunting narrative illuminates the sin in all with the unrelenting search for redemption. Most intriguing read I have experienced since Janet Fitch's ""White Oleander."" Marvelously novel; I await Hepinstall's next endeavor!"
3,An unexpected Surprise,I went into this book thinking it was a tale of war and love and came out of it knowing it was much more.What would you do if your perfect world was torn upside down and inside out w/in a few weeks. One minute your worried about finding love and the next you have the unexpected happen. When you read this book go into it with an open mind and open heart.You'll want to care for Charlotte and Milo and want to help poor Louise get her life in proper perspective. The men Ahhh the men there are no men like these out there. Friends lives aren't what they seem and secrets are always hidden. What happens when you can no longer hide them and who will be the real savior? Read this book and find out what redemption really is.
5,"Breathtaking, Enchanting, and Mesmerizing!","This is an astonishing novel full of inventive characters, intricate plot lines, and deep human emotions. I found myself riveted by the intersecting lives of these remarkable people as they discover sin and redemption, selfishness and sacrifice.I devoured this book on the first reading, then went back twice more to immerse myself fully in the imagery, to feel for each and every person in this remarkable novel.Congratulations to Kathy Hepinstall on such an extraordinary debut - may this be just the first of many!"
4,Marvelous read!,"This book was almost impossible to put down. The writing style just captures your attention and won't let go. I was made to feel for the characters and to care about their lives and needs. I don't think the author was trying to say that all men are monsters or that all women are victims of men's lust. We have to admit, however, that there are a great many people in the world living with a guilt of one sort or another, and there are women and men who have been victims of someone's anger, passion, etc. She focuses on one small group of people who can be described that way, and I don't think that means that she is lumping everyone in the world in those two categories. Wouldn't it be wonderful to feel redeemed, forgiven and loved? Give this book a try. You won't be disappointed."
5,"Astonishing, Intimate, Original","In these days of fic-by-numbers by authors who produce work after work without originality or soul, this book shines forth like a beacon to what writing can be. Every word of this novel made me vibrate with a sense of the magic of Kathy Hepinstall's vision and craft. She has created wounded characters of great originality, a South recognizable as same but blessedly devoid of picaresque cliches, and an engaging and heartbreaking story. Her writing is fresh, alive, poetic without self-consciousness, totally accessible, as intimate as your next breath. This novel is a jewel. It will be praised and shared among friends like a meal served with pride. The printed book itself will grow creased from travelling and rereadings. The story, however, will always stay fresh, and unfolding with layers and meaning, in my heart.OPRAH, YOU ARE MISSING OUT! <g>Kathy, bless you. Write more."
3,A beguiling story of redemption,"The concept of a house of gentle men, where women who have suffered (for one reason or another) can be administered to by men who seek to atone for their own wrongdoing is a seductive one.Suspend your disbelief, though, and imagine how such places could heal emotional scars. It is a wonderful premise for a novel and the story of Charlotte and Justin and the agony of his redemption is absorbing and poignant.My only criticism is that I feel the book would have been better located in a Civil War context - for some reason, the post World War II setting did not ring true for me."
3,"Very predictable, overdone characters","The House of Gentle Men was a book I wanted to like - I liked the premise, and found it very different than most of the books I've been reading. However, the characters were so overdone, and simplistic, and the plot was far too predictable. I believe this was intentional, but found that it made the reading of this novel too boring. Far too many coincidences for me - but an interesting story nonetheless."
4,A Good first novel,"The title and cover of this first novel were beautiful enough to pique my curiosity. Upon reading the story, I found this book to start with an unusual and intriguing concept, but the characters are one dimensional, without enough depth to allow us to really understand the emotions behind their often impulsive actions. However, having lived in the backwoods of Louisiana, I could really feel those chiggers bite!"
2,A Waste of Time,"....I also work for a domestic violence program .... Not only is this book unrealistic in regards to rape victims, it also has no resolution. It seems that this book just ends midstream, leaving the entire conclusion up to the reader's imagination. I was sorry I wasted my time reading this book."
1,Are you kidding me?!,"What is the matter with all you women who liked this?! Were we even reading the same book?!What a great big fat load of crap this book was! I am completely astounded that so many people -- especially women -- would sing such great praises for this insulting waste of paper. The characters are completely one dimensional and unbelieveable; the dialogue is horrendously false-sounding an uninteresting; and the tidy little wrapped up package in the end is insulting to an intellegent reader. Worst of all is the idea of a rape victim falling in love with her attacker. As a rape survivor, I am thoroughly insulted and disgusted by this. The author should be ashamed of herself for writing it and the publisher for printing it. There will be letters written to the author and the publisher and I will never again pick up another book written by this woman.If I could have taken stars away from this book, I would have."
1,ONCE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH,"THIS WAS KATHY HEPINSTALL'S FIRST NOVEL AND THE LAST ONE I WILL READ!! I WANTED TO STOP READING FROM CHAPTERS 1-5, BUT HATE TO GIVE UP ON A BOOK. STARTING @ CHAPTER 16 THE STORY BECAME SOME WHAT BAREABLE.CHAPTER 33, THE LAST CHAPTER, WAS GOOD UNTIL THE LAST PAGE."
5,Unforgettable!,"Several days have passed since I finished reading this amazing novel, and I still find myself thinking of passages and lines, until I have to pick up the book and reread them again. That's what Kathy Hepinstall's novel does -- it works its way into your heart and mind and just doesn't let go. Her deft handling of atmosphere leaves the reader feeling as though she were part of the book. The characters become friends making me want to hold some of them, shake others, and weep for all of them. The themes are timeless and universal, but hardly nowhere more moving than seen through the eyes of these characters.I echo what someone else said here -- this is a book that deserves the attention Oprah's Book Club would give it. I can think of none better."
5,awesome,"I love this product and have been using it as my over night moisturizer instead of my old one and it really keeps my skin moist and smooth, but it is too expensive for a cleanser tho! This product used to be around $8 back when it was still in the stores but they jumped the price up since they stopped selling it."
5,"Mad collection, excellent group. Group possessing big power.",I long thought to buy it or not? I have all albums. Selection of songs the simply fantastic. There are stereo options. More they aren't present on other disks. It is very happy with purchase.
5,Authentic taste,"I am a very experimental cook, and just love making dishes from any country I can. Indian cuisine is one of our family favorites, but as anyone who cooks these dishes know they can be very time consuming if prepared from scratch, and all ingredients must be available to achieve that authentic taste. I have made Indian rice from scratch and must say that Badshah Masala makes my rice taste as though I spent hours preparing it, and also cuts out most of the prep time."
4,Heed the Call...,"A wonderful look at the aspet of Divine that is often overlooked or ignored in explanations of modern Paganism. The general public gets so saturated with the idea that Paganism is all Goddess worship, that this book becomes an invaluable resource for explaining and presenting the Horned God in His true nature. A must for anyone looking for a more accurate protrayal of Wicca and its belief in balance among all things, including the Divine."
2,What a slog !,"This book is too long, includes too many details, fails to give the reader a feel for the overall picture. While there is substantial important information, there is way too much stuff about Newman's personal disputes with various Anglicans and Catholics. The title clearly misstates the nature of the book. If you want to learn about Newman's importance, read Dulles' short book instead."
5,a must for cancer patients!,"this brilliant researcher that dedicated his life to the research of the ip6 , is now getting a full acceptance to his natural anti cancer substance:the ip6.it was proved to be a anti-cancer substance against almost any kind of cancer, and it is in my opinion marching behind (but not far behind) the antioxidants vitamins:c\e\beta caroten\selenium\coq10\dr shamsudin explain and explored in detail the ip6 better than anybody, and also reveal the mechanisms of it and also in what kinds of foods you can find it,eventhough you will have to take an extra suplements.he shows scientific proves and graphs that showing beyond any reasonable doubt that this remarcable ip6 is a potent anti cancer agent. the book is very easy to understand, buy this book today."
5,Science Not Sales,"Dr. Shamsuddin offers a very appropriate and understandable treatise of his many years of investigating the properties and effects of a simple yet important nutritional substance. Using well designed experiments he presents the significant effects of IP6 on cancer and other diseases. As a researcher and physician myself, I find his work and its presentation praiseworthy. I use IP6 in treating patients confidently due to the evidence he provides. Importantly his work is educational and lacking of any huckstering of ""supplements"" so prevalent in the media.Richard R. Mason MS, DO, NMD"
2,"Some interesting points, but very uneven.","While parts of this book were very thought-provoking, too many details were either left out or skimmed over to allow this book to stand alone. For example, the formula the author supplies to calculate the eccentricity of a simplex couldn't possibly produce the results he gives in the adjoining table; some are infinite, and the formula as he states is specifically designed to avoid such results. If you're really interested in catastophe theory or chaos theory, make sure you read this book where you have other reference materials on hand."
4,Pretty good Mini PCI wireless,I had a problem with losing connection about every 2 mins or so. The only thing that seemed to fix it was to disconnect the aux antenna. After that card has been very reliable.
5,Excellent wireless card for non-Intel laptop,"I was so happy to find a wireless card that did not depend on Intel chips (Centrino chip set, Pentium/Celeron etc.) as I have a laptop with an AMD processor in it. I found this wireless card used in a currently manufactured AMD powered laptop and the specs listed on MSI's website were quite impressive - so I bought it. The card and its drivers are easy to install - however one needs to pay attention to which terminal(s) they connect the antenna lead(s) to as the main and aux terminals are reversed from most other cards but they are labeled. The card works very well and I have not been disappointed."
5,"Intriguing theory, fantastic book","I read this book the first time many many years ago and was bowled over by both the theory and Allen Eckert's plot. Since that time I haven't found anything else that quite combined the plausibility of the scientific theory with a decent plot. I think Lucifer's Hammer, while a favorite, comes a distant second. Amazingly I found a copy of the paperback just a week ago in a local used bookstore after searching for it on and off for at least 20 years. I was never quite sure I had the title right so didn't bother to check online. Silly me! At the time I first read it I was not that interested in hard SF but despite its scientific basis it reads like a suspense novel right off of today's bestseller lists. I recommend it to anyone who loves Ludlum or Asimov, Grisham or Cherryh."
3,The HAB Theroy,"Very, Very, Very disappointed in the size of the book. It is 8.25 inches wide X 11 inches high X ~1.25"" thick. The borders in side are 1 inch left X 1 inch right X ~1.25 inches top X ~1.25 inches bottom. Basically it is in a text book size. Now how can anyone find this size versatile for reading especially when they are on the go? One thing for sure is that I won't be able to stick it in my purse to take with me. I have been re-reading this book for well over 20 plus years until each copy would eventually wear out. The story line by Allan W. Eckert (having ""The Frontiersmen"" among other books to his credit) is extremely great and an absolute good read. Considering the upcoming 2012 theories I am sure that there will be a renewed interest in this book. So if all you want is a good book to read and don't mind the real problem of the size of this book then be sure to read this one."
5,Totally believable science fiction,"When I was in college in the late seventies I purchased this book from my college bookstore. I loved this book it held me in its grip from beginning to end. My whole family and even my neighbors read it. We found ourselves saying ""and then the lights went all over the world"". Over the years the book got lost I hope to find another copy ."
3,"Sci-Fi great, love story crap","Ok, I read this upon a suggestion of a friend and while I liked all the ""science,"" theory and the ending. The ""love story"" between Anne, Mr. Grant and Marie made me skip through large portions of this book. I absolutely hate it that society is so keen on showing that cheating and the break up of marriages is totally acceptable. This was written in the 70's too! In society today, marriages split up at over 50% and cheating is considered no big deal. I beg to differ. If your marriage is sucky, leave it. Then find your next partner. I have no idea why this relationship was such a focal point of this book. Other relationships actually added to the story, this one just took away. I would have loved this book without the love triangle. The information and items found in mysterious places is intriguing and the ending was great."
1,This one took me back to the 70s...,"I remember this one from when I was in college. Unfortunately, it did not hold up well on a re-read. Based on a thin thesis involving a poor, 70s-era understanding of physics and earth science, at 566 pages this thing is 2/3 longer than it should have been. (And there isn't enough sex to make the rest of it bearable!) I give it one star because Amazon won't let me give it fewer. Put this one on the shelf next to Von Daniken's Chariots of the Gods."
2,Incredibly bad edition,"I was very disappointed with this book, in particular since I am a HUGE fan of Allan Eckert's series of books about the settlement of the American West (I've read and absolutely loved every one of them).... I am still surprised that there are so few reviews less than 5 stars. The basic premise of HAB Theory is scientifically very weak, and the dialog and action between characters is unrealistic. I also felt that the book seemed 'dated', and therefore has lost some of its energy over the years. Finally, what pushed me over the edge to give this book a bad review is the SHAMEFULLY BAD printing of the Backprint.com edition of the book. It is very distracting to have a new paragraph begin in the middle of a sentence! This editorial blunder occurs about every 10-15 pages, and is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the poor job of printing. If a reader decides to give this book a try, I suggest finding an out-of-print used copy."
5,By far the best book I've ever read,"Superb book. First read it in 1976 and was blown away by the scientific facts in it & recently re-read it. Better second time round and has more of an impact. Full of scientific facts that can be independently verified after reading the book. The love story is necessary to carry the book through, otherwise it might be too intense to take in, but must admit, I jumped some of that bit just to get to the science bits !! - but the way it is written makes you never want to put the book down. Must be made into a film sometime...?"
5,Hello.....Little-Brown !! Republish! Please....,"I, too, read a borrowed copy......and have been looking for another forever! I can't believe it was never on the Best Seller List. What a powerful story! I only learned later that it was based on fact......and got frightened all over again! Should be required reading for all Science Majors!"
5,Love this book.,This is a great book. I have read it several times in past years. Service was great from the seller. Would use them again. Thank you.
3,Little small,I used these to make a middle console in my classic car. They work ok for cans but really nothing else.
4,review from far,this book is one of the suitable cases about composites.and in-hand standrads is not used in our counry and at the text of book isn't point to whom standards are used detailed.and i've never study original text of this case but from the translated issue i understand this book was one of the best ones.althogh it seams that the order of book is special so that sometimes it confused the reader.
5,Doctor Recommended,Great for a sleepy colon. Will continue to buy. Great product. Pair it up with pericolace. Had gastric bypass and this help to prevent intestinal distress.
1,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed with the hummingbird house. It looked nothing like the photo. No ""roof"" and fake plastic branches that arrived broken due to being shoved into too small a box. I purchased this item as a gift and was very embarrassed when it was opened. It looked like a Dollar Store purchase."
3,Useful but limited and outdated...,"I'll be honest--I purchased the book for nostalgic reasons. My original copy bought decades ago got lost over my various transcontinental re-locations, and I was able to buy a new book with shipping for $5.89 from an Amazon vendor last month.The book contains phrases in Italian with phonetic (but not IPA) pronunciation guides and English translations below each phrase. In today's day and age, with CDs, iPod downloads, and interactive DVDs available, the book is about as useful as a bent horseshoe to young people. To older folks, it's an OK tool if you're planning a trip to Italy, but one would never become a fluent speaker by using this book. Even the publisher admits in the introduction that the book has greater value when used in a group setting. No tedious grammar in the lessons--again, just a phrase book of everyday expressions really..."
5,Great Adjunct to Berlitz Courses,"I speak German fluently, thanks to getting my start from the Berlitz Self-Teacher in German, but I've always had trouble learning Italian, even though I studied it for two semesters in the late 1980s in college.Nonetheless, I took Italian courses at the Berlitz school in Princeton, NJ, last year to refresh my knowledge of the language. Although the course had a companion book (written in the 1970s), I found this older volume to be more helpful with keeping up with my teacher, who was quite a taskmaster.Now that I am back in Texas, and no longer taking Italian at Berlitz, I am still working my way through the book. It keeps you entertained, and I like the ""little professor"" illustrations, particulaly those of Italian celebrities of the day, such as Arturo Toscanini and Joe DiMaggio. Fun book!"
4,The Berlits Self Teacher Italian,"This book has been very useful for our purpose. We are anticipating another classto start in the near future. What I would like to know from you is; can you you get more of these books (About 30),or recommend a suitable substitution. This book is presently being used as an aid to the students whoare inrolled in the ""beginning Italian Class"". Please reply.Thank you"
3,Sounds like a demo,"I love Anvil - just saw them live last month and they were awesome - but I don't love this CD. They really needed a quality producer for this disc as it certainly does not live up to its potential. There are good riffs and good grooves, but the production and mix is terrible. Lips' vocals are not good - they are too up front in the mix and distract from the music. Sounds like they were on a tight budget or time schedule, because as another reviewer said, it seems as though a lot of the songs were first takes. Stylistically, many of the songs are very similar to ""This is Thirteen"" - more of a Motorhead/Judas Priest vibe rather than a speed metal/thrash vibe. When I listen to ""Back to Basics"", I wonder how good this could be with proper production. It would be nice if they would revisit some of these tunes, either for a live disc or compilation; with some reworking, a few could be real gems."
3,Same dilemma here,"I've been looking for a song that goes over that same beat for a short time now. I used to hear it all the time when I was growing up and it's been very special to me. anyway, unlike ""murder she wrote"", it's more reggae than dancehall and i do remember the artist rapping in a strong accent. if it helps, i recently found out that the beat or rhythm used in both songs is called ""bam bam riddim"" first produced by sly and robbie and a lot of jamaican songs are sung over it. That might help narrowing it down."
2,Not worth it,"This game was fun while it lasted... However, I beat it in a week. Now that I know what I'm doing, I could beat it in a day. Aside from the lack of levels (10 short ones), this game is fun. One shot kills, so the realistic level is impressive. However, the enemies can almost never see you, so it's way too easy."
4,Mission accepted from a gamer .,"I think this is one of the best Game Boy games around, it has action adventure and best of all one hit and you are dead. This is probaly one of the most realistic action games for the Game Boy color except the guards almost never see you and never do see you if you are crawling(which by the way is a nice feature). I like the way you only have a pistol or a grenade. I think there should have been more levels though the last one is almost impossible. I think the agent organizer was a good idea.this paragragh will self destruct in five, four..."
1,Mission Impossible GB Color,This game could have been fun. There are many times where i had no idea what was going on. It is also very hard and annoying. The agent organizer was a good idea though.
4,"Mission Impossible...Ok so it's Possible, but...","Hey, I thought this game was pretty good. And if your wondering why I gave it 4 stars is because it was pretty dang easy. I beat it in like 10-20 minutes(No joke. One more thing to a reviewer of this game: How the heck did it take 9 hrs. to be the game!?). But over all the rest was pretty good. Graphics are like GBC's full potential and the sound was pretty good for sneaking around and being a spy And being that it is so short, I have beaten it way too many times. When I first got it, I would beat it like 3-5 times a day(HEY!! I was bored, and didn't own any other gaming system/console/whatever). So, anyway(sorry to ramble on), I am no amateur gamer(never found a game I couldn't be), I'd say it all depends on your skills. Just don't tell me it's too hard for you; I'll ignore you."
5,An excellent collection!,"This book is a collection of the first two books in the Seasons of Pleasure series. Anya Bast also writes fantasy romance under the name Joanna King, so it is not surprising that her erotic romance novels contain strong fantasy elements.In Seasons of Pleasure, her skill in fantasy world building is showcased to great advantage. With fluid strokes of her pen, she brings the fantasy world of Aran and its inhabitants to vivid life. If you have tired of filmsy plots that are just an excuse for characters to go on marathon sex escapades and like something with a little more meat, you will be delighted by the two stories. The history, characters, cultures, politics and conflicts are rich, fascinating and believable. Those who like their romance spicy need not worry. Anya Bast knows how to build the sexual tension between her protagonists until the pages burn. Anaya Bast is definitely an author to watch out for."
4,Wonderful Page Turner,One of those - cant put down books - read it in one day - justwanted to know what was happening next - well worth your time and money.
3,Almost What I Wanted,"In fact, it's a little tricky to use this as a hand-held device; I'd suggest using it only when it's securely placed over a small bowl. The actual cutting area is a bit narrower than I'd expected, and I'd hoped for a setting that would allow slightly thicker slices as well. Great idea - I bought it, didn't I? - but not really what the doctor ordered...."
3,movie,"They are celebrating the pagan holiday of 'winter solstice' kinda weird, probably wouldn't have bought this if I had known."
3,No paleontologist,My children love Dinosaur Train. They were dissapointed there is no paleontologist explaining things and that each episode has the beginning song so it has become a little annoying to them.
1,Do not buy this,"This is the worst A/C I have ever seen. First of all, even though it says on the box ""ultra quiet"", it is nearly as noisy as vacuum cleaner, you won't be able to sleep or talk while it is on. Also it doesn't cool well, we have a very small bedroom {only big enough to fit a queen size bed and two dressers, with not much room left} and it doesn't cool it nearly as well as our old GE Air Conditioner {that is only 5000 BTU}. I am taking it back today and will rather wait for a nicer one {all the stores are out of A/C right now and this one was the only one we found, but better nothing then this one}"
1,"Loud, weak and now broken","I got my Haier in March/April of 2011. It was OK, certainly didn't work as one would think a 7800 BTU A/C would work in a small bedroom, but it did work, although it is extremely noisy. Maybe the loudest A/C I've ever owned. But at least it worked; didn't last 10 months. Now won't turn on. So I would totally avoid Haier. They produce loud, weak and poorly made A/Cs."
1,Very little horror or anything else.,"A dull, plodding novel about a bunch of seaside citizens who endlessly lament their collective past. A boy comes back from the dead. Some witchcraft nonsense. Rather unlikeable."
4,Basic poker chips exactly as described,"I'm not sure what those posting hysterical, negative reviews of bargain-price plastic poker chips were expecting but the comments seem over the top and silly. These are standard size chips made of rigid plastic that will do the trick for your typical poker or game nights with friends. Now I could prattle on about how neatly the white chips fit with the blue chips or compose an urgent, conspiracy theory about the seller but the sane among you would think both of those actions to be silly beacuse we're talking about PLASTIC POKER CHIPS THAT COST LESS THAN TEN BUCKS. The item arrived as described and on time. Payment and shipping were both without hassle or any problems. Unless you are playing poker in the VIP Suite at a Monte Carlo casino, these chips will work just fine."
1,poker chips,From the description I expected to get full sized chips. Instead I got very small chips and can't use them. I didn't return them since it would have cost too much.
1,Fifth Rate Chips,"I had my wife pick these up while on vacation so I could teach her family how to play poker. I had asked for Hoyle chips but Walgreens only carried these. Wow, the work ""JUNK"" would be a complement. Every single chip has a nub on it where they were roughly torn off the plastic mould. I had to file down every one of them just to make them usable. Very thin and they DO NOT lock, just slide off each other. If you're a cheap SOB, whatever. But for people who have an ounce of self worth, order something else. The basic Hoyle plastic chips aren't that much more."
5,For the serious MLS fan,"With the letdown that was FIFA 2000, MLS gamenight leads the way with real MLS gameplay. With real teams, realistic players not to mention the ability to play a real 32 game season this game really rocks. Unlike FIFA 2000 that limited the realism of the true MLS game, MLS Gamenight lets you build a franchise. Trades in this game are realistic as well, you won't be getting Cobi Jones for some bench player. Also tourmanet setup is way better than before. The serious MLS fan will truly enjoy this game for all its complexities as well as awesome game play."
1,Very confusing,"I find this book to be very, very confusing. Sometimes postions are given to find the correct moves. And then I cannot find where the answers are. The book also jumps from very very simple to then very very complicated without explaining things so I can understand. I am rated 900 and don't like this book at all."
1,Does not compare to my other endgame book,"I am 10 years old. I thought this book would add more after reading my other endgame book, CHESS ENDINGS: ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE (which is excellent). However, my first endgame book covered all of the important things in Maceunltys book plus a lot more. It was a loss of money to have bought this book."
1,Poorly Organized & So Limited,"Why a book on how to ""Queen a Pawn"" when not even showing what to do once you get a Queen? Well obviously this book was written in an organized way.When teaching chess to a beginner you would teach how to checkmate with a Queen before showing how to get one. But this book was written without that basic piece of advice.There are numeous typos making some of the material impossible to understand not to mention that the author of this book (I looked him up on www.uschess.org the rating list) was not an expert or a master rated player himself but was beind about 30,000 other rated players in the country.Why Random House would hire a person to write books who cannot play chess at a top or even a significanly above aveage tournament level is beyond me!"
1,Too hard,"I am only 9. My parents got me this book. This book is for older kids because I don't understand it. I got Bruce Pandolfini's book and like it much, much more because it was writen so someone my age could understand it.I looked at other reviews here. It seems that some teacher readers mike like it as their guide. But for a kid to get it, it stinks bad."
2,Not much material,"It covers so little material and is very thin. Even a book for kids should have a lot more than this. This book should have gone into more types of endgames which would have been useful for children, starting with the basic engame checkmates, and then after the King and Pawn endings, perhaps the more important basic Rook and Pawn endings. If the author intends to write more books on the endgames, I can see that he is just trying to break up into many books what could have been one good one."
1,Hard To Understand,The way the book is written is very hard for me to understand. I may only be 8 but I should be able to understand this book. Not writen for a kid.
2,Just OK,This book contains some good ideas for the beginner. My biggest problem is that the book does not seem to allways cover things in the proper order and jumps to too many ideas too quickly. This makes it hard for me to understand some things. This book was in my sixth grade class. I found Pandofini's Engame Book to be much better.
1,Difficult,"I purchased this book to use as a text book in the classes I teach for kids.It is poorly organized and jumps around too much. Not the most logicla progression of material.The book, even though as the title suggests covers King and Pawn endings, a primer on how to checkmate with a King and Queen against a King should have been included (i.e. what does the kid do once a Pawn is Queened!).Just bad writing. Stay away from this one."
3,Caution On This Set,"The piano is not balanced with the violin and cello, it drowns them out. The violin at times is quite muted and the cello is often indistinct. Listen to the samples critically before buying. I found the same problem on another Philips set of Haydn Piano Trios."
2,Piano sonatas more or less,"Two stars only. One other reviewer has commented on the balance of these recordings. Piano is ridiculously dominant. Violin and cello barely audible at times. Having other recordings by Florestan Trio , Kempff with Fournier and Szering and the Stern , Rose ,Istomin recordings I do have something with which to compare. Sound quality aside these B. Arts interpretations are pretty awful destroying Archduke and Ghost and even the Opus 1. I find it hard to believe anyone could like these unless on grounds of having no other recordings. Prospective purchasers beware or better still avoid."
1,Holy.....,"Wow. I only spent $2 on this movie, and I have never been more upset about losing $2 than when I bought this flick. If I had set the dollar bills on fire and lit a cigarette with them, it would have been a better deal. The only thing good about this movie was the sex scene, and even that was a proverbial ""nightmare"". The producers, actors, marketers and anyone having any hand in this flick (except for the dog and cat-- the best actors in the whole movie) should get new jobs immediately. I am depressed beyond words after watching this flick, and I am going to go get drunk and try to get over the wasted 77 minutes of my life (and the $2). Please, please, I implore you, never make a movie again."
4,Decent,"I read this book for a MultiCultural Childrens Literature class at Eastern Michigan University. It's a prety good book. The main character, Justine, is a little unrealistic of a character. However, it's still a good book."
5,True teen voice exploring religion and the trials of being a middle child,"Justine Silver is a middle child in a modern Jewish family. Her parents have rejected some of the more orthodox traditions, but her grandmother still keeps kosher and rests on the Sabbath. Confused by her own religion, Justine becomes a (literal) closet Catholic, holding confessional and keeps a checklist of sins in her bedroom closet. Her ""dialogue"" with the ""priest"" in the closet (a teddy bear has to stand in) is absolutely priceless and comic.When her dabblings in Catholicism are exposed, the family is shocked. Justine often wonders if her grandmother's stroke was caused by her own rejection of religion and tradition. In a funny and heartwarming tale, Justine explores two different faiths and finally comes to peace with her own faith, all while dealing with the usual traumas of being a middle child with a perfect older sister. Highly recommended."
2,"good product, but come written","In general, the book is good, but I bought a new book and I received a written book. No honest!!! I realized that some parts of a chapter were highlighted with a yellow marker some months after I received the book. So, I could not return it."
4,Love These Pens!,"Great little pens. My only complaint is that the ink globs up sometimes. Easy to use, fits my hand great, cheap, like the colour."
3,Off-road or bust.,Good footage of different off-road disciplines. Nice way to open minds to some of the possibilities available to enjoy. Funnier than shoveling snow!
4,pretty cool,"Lots of stuff going on, shows some of what regular people can never get to see in far off places, in different parts of the country."
2,Reviewer Steadfastly Refused to Title His Review,This CD belongs in the realm of what you're listening to. Upon listening to the CD I can only say that this is music that I'd always hoped was being written and sung.There is no way to compare it to any particular group or artist...but...I guess that makes it unique.Listen. I love the CD.I hope you do to.Check out the samples.Greg Sandell
2,An OK read,"This 80's romance from the Wildfire teen romance series is written by Helen Cavanagh. If you want to read a much better Cavanagh book, try Superflirt. This book is ""ok"" but not something I will go back and read again for a long, long time. Colleen is part of a very big family and she feels like she is closed in and never has any privacy. Throughout this book, she acts like she has PMS. She meets Jonathan at the riding stables she frequents and it seems just a couple pages later, she is telling him she loves him. She hopes to keep him a secret from her very nosey and intrustive family, but they find out and insist on meeting him. Her opinion of Jonathan slips when he (gasp!) enjoys her family and being with them. Colleen then tells off a few people and mopes around, before something tragic happens and she has a change of heart and everything is all peaches and cream with Jonathan and her family."
5,Works great in my BMW M3,Got this on Amazon and it works great with my Bose system! 15 inch neon black tube at a very cheap price. You will pay twice as much at a store.
1,Not worth the money,This game only installs on Windows 95 or 98. It does not install on Windows XP or Vista. I did locate an old computer running Windows 95. The game is not much fun. No graphics just typed feedback. What a drag.
4,Return to Form,"This is another return to form after some misfired industrial outings. Largely typical heavy metal. Key tracks are: Skincarver, Netherbound and Black Angel, White Angel."
3,Danzig 'Circle Of Slightly Above Average',"Danzig's newest offering 'Circle Of Snakes' is 40% rockin' and 60% filler. Tracks like 'Black Angel, White Angel' and '1000 Demons Reign' bring back fond memories of old school Danzig. But there's so much boring mush filler on here that its hard to look past. But the major problem here is the uneven production. Its all over the place: sometimes the guitar track is extra loud and you can't hear Glenn and sometimes vice versa. Bottomline: some tracks totally kill, some really suck."
5,DANZIG-Back just in time for Halloween,"it ain't fall without this great singer and his crushing band to lead us into the darkness of October.This disc is dark,heavy and the guitar sounds awesum-if you don't already know about Danzig,sorry about your luck!"
3,Moribund,"This album's pretty good, but I was really expecting something better since I've heard alot of hype about it, plus with 7 being so good. The lyrics as usual are great, but some of the music is just sort of bland and boring. One thing that I do love about this album is the overall feel of it is very dark. Overall I really like it and if you're a Danzig fan you'll definately enjoy it."
4,His best work in a long time...,"First of all, if you are interested in Danzig, buy his 2nd album, Lucifuge, one of the finest CDs ever released. If you like that, then buy 1,3, and 4 in that order. Then get his live album.If you still need a Danzig fix and have money left over, get this, but be warned.IT IS VERY DIFFERENT!Gone are the fluid, face-melting John Christ guitar solos of yesteryear, gone is Glenn's deep, booming, bone-rattling voice, and gone too is the slow, bluesy feeling that permeated his better albums. No, this is a Danzig of raspy voices and bland Industrial guitar. Now, that is not to say this is a bad album, merely that it is very different. ""Black Angel, White Angel"" and ""1000 Devils Reign"" are great songs. Overall, this album is good music, but not good Danzig."
3,Another disappointment,"Being a longtime Misfits, Samhain, Danzig fan, it pains me to think the great Glenn Danzig may have lost the plot. His strength was his ability to write hard, brutal songs but with a strong sense of melody. That gift has been sporadic at best since Blackacidevil. Circle of Snakes continues with the same problem. There is no denying Danzig can still create intriguing atmospheres and soundscapes, but the melodies are largely missing. After going through the album I continue to be impressed by his vocals and abilities as a producer, but there is nothing that stands out save Black Angel, White Angel. The demonic lyrics have become almost laughable. Some of his aging fans want to hear Glenn grow through his music. Like most music greats, I think Danzig is struggling to find his place again in music. I think it is only a matter of time before he rediscovers what made him the baddest man in metal. Maybe performing with Doyle during the Blackest of the Black tour will inspire him."
4,Glenn at 50 yrs. old still has what most artists never will!,"Lets all realize Glenn is 50, yes FIFTY years old and still puts out quality music. How many artists who have had the ability to stay in the music business have stayed to there roots like Danzig? Answer is not many, and that alone needs to be appreciated. Now on to Circle of snakes I put as maybe the fourth or 5th best album in the Danzig catalog which does not mean this is a bad cd, in fact it means its pretty darn good. Guitar work is extremely good, vocals on most songs I wish was emphasized more, but still acceptable, Gleen still has a terrific voice but needs to be heard more clear. Overall any DANZIG fan would love this cd.. Recommended to anyone willing to Rockout with 50 yr. old metal legend!!!!!!"
4,its aint 94 anymore,"i was going through the other reviews for this cd and i found that most of them unhappy with this cd just cause its aint 94 (its aint danzig4) the 1st thing that i want to ask here, Do you want another danzig4? i dont, what im lookin for is a cd that will rock hard a cd that i wont feel that iv wasted my cash on. danzig had changed with age thats why his vocals are aint the same and the styles that his invinting are differ then the style that he sing in on danzig2 .. this is a cool cd that has its weaknesses in few parts specially some of the guitar work, the days that JC had rocked the world are gone, unfortunatly that even JC solo cd was an ok but not a killer. my advice is buy this cd and judge for your self if its worth the price. or wait for a special priced cd :)"
2,Love Danzig and hate to say...,"If Danzig III - How the Gods Kill is a 10, this album would be about a five to me. His voice is hurting bad on this album. But hey, he's 50 now, right? The album is not BAD, but people who are giving it 5 stars are exagerrating a bit, or being too optimistic. Danzig is my favorite metal band, along with Pantera, but he has long lost his old style. There are almost no tempo changes or surprises of any kind throuhgout the songs on this album. The songs did not slow down or speed up, etc... they were just kinda bland or plain. For another band, this album would probably be great! BUT - I have heard what Glenn can do and this is a few steps down. Any Danzig fan should obviously still buy this album. It is GOOD. But just don't over expect."
4,very good!!****,This is a great album by the talented artist. This album is lot closer to the Danzig's first two albums. Sound wise it is consistent through out the whole CD. I hope that Danzig continues writing music in the same direction as his latest effort.
1,Worst since Blackacidevil,"Sounds and looks like it was written, recorded, mixed, designed, in one day. Danzig has seen better days, not many at all since 94 unfortunately. The silicone hoes and the gloves are quite funny on the other hand. I don't think Danzig has ever really taken himself this seriously ever in his career, expecially with those gloves..."
1,WHY?,"This ablum is over done with the same sound over and over. DANZIG is always going to be, but this ablum sounds like old man Glenn. His voice wasn't there and the guitar was over done on his singing.I have been a fan since I was 12 now 24. But I am just disappointed by this work."
1,Does Anyone Remember when Danzig was good?,"This new album is horrible. Boring is a better word for it. Every time buy a new Danzig on faith hoping that it would be good I get horribly dissapointed. And it seems to have happend one to many times. Three times to be exact. The Circle of Snakes is the last straw I'm sending the CD back to him asking for my money back.If you are a new Danzing fan and happen to like this CD do yourself a favor and pick up any of his first four albums. If you do and compare it to this hunk of garbage you'll understand where I'm comming from.For any of you who think I'm being to harsh, just know that I'm a long time Danzing fan and I'm not a ""letter writer"". I have had my heartbroken one to many times."
2,too bad,"I guess this is the last time i will by a danzig CD blindly.The cd is weak at its best , and it has been said before but Ireally cant understand the mixing of the vocals. guitars are boring , not a single lead in the album ( i mean a real one!!).The booklet is so bad its almost amusing , and im not talking about the music , it should be different than the first years , but the naked girls thing is just plain stupid.I don't know what will come next , but i personally don't think much of this album , but to each his own i guess.But it is hard to write a review on this album while listening to killer wolf on the headphones.Unless you can force yourself to love a danzig album even if it is bad , i wouldn't recommend this one."
2,"Too Little, Too Late...","Danzing has become a parody of himself. This new album attempts to resurrect his past glories on Danzig 1 through 4. Is this collection of tunes a response for being fool and getting knocked out? As a long time fan (I am 30 and have been listening to his stuff since the 80's), I just think his time is up (and has been for a while). Next year Glenn turns 50. I hope he continues to do music, if that is what he wants to do, but he needs to realize he can't compete with his past. In the end, ""Danzig"" was Glenn AND John, Erie, Chuck - THEY were the band! R.I.P Glenn."
1,Don't buy - you'll only encourage them!!!,"Glen should have called it quits after 4 and gone out on a super high note. Everything since has been WEAK. I don't know what some of the other reviewers are thinking. ""Glen is back"" ""Sounds like their early work"" - sounds like nobody buying this album!"
5,Brilliant!!,"Danzig has done it again. I am a huge huge fan and have been since the begining, and this album is amazing. Since blackacidevil, the tone has changed a bit...Satan's Child was great and again was different, then Danzig 7 was again brilliant, but changing still. Then comes Circle of Snakes and wow this disk blew me away. This is the best album since 4 easily. The whole disc is mind blowing, not a bad track...great crunch on guitar and Glenn is back to the great vocals we all love! My personal fav is Hellmask and the haunting sound of Black angel white angel! Buy this!!"
3,Three good songs-- the rest are mediocre,"1. Black Angel, White Angel 2. When We Were Dead 3. Netherbound (BEST song on the entire cd!)-- that's all there is to say about this cd."
3,Red Hot Chili Peppers Fan,"I pretty much got this CD for one reason-""Soul to Squeeze"" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. There is only one more CD on the planet that has that song, and it's very hard to find. This and ""Tainted Love"" are great songs, but the rest was mediocre."
3,Wouldn't buy again,"I mainly bought this album for the Red Hot Chili Peppers song, as I couldn't find it anywhere. I later discovered they released it on their greatest hits album. If I could do it again I would have just bought that.Not the best soundtrack..."
2,"Where are the stars? Not in my rating, that's for sure!","Short and simple is one description for this CD, but that's not what bugs me the most! Of most, I wanted to hear Dan Aykroyd's rendition of 'Tainted Love' and 'Don't Want To Hold My Cone Alone'. The other versions, I can get them else where! Very dissapointing."
3,good pictures but incorrect book received and bad binding!!!,"The pictures are good but be careful:- I ordered 12 books in English and I received 5 of them in English and 7 in French (they have the same ISBN 9782080301383) !- the binding falls apart for several books as described in another review. This is very disapointing.The best solution, go to Provence and take your own picturesRegards"
3,Don't depend solely on these directions,"We didn't find the maps terribly useful. Without carrying the entire book around with us on the walk, it was pretty hard to keep track using the map only. Lucky for us we had a google map of the area saved to an i pod, and could cross reference, but even then, there were discrepancies."
2,Laugh Out Loud -- NOT!,"I do love my cats too much but I don't need a non-cat person to tell me that. I couldn't quite put a finger on it at first until I realized the obvoious: Ronnie Sellers is not a cat person. That much I derived from the ""about the author"" page. He does not even profess to be a cat lover at all. This book is but a compilation of anecdotes from cat lovers from all over. Sellers says the idea of doing this book came from a cat person he met in a book shop. That woman should have been the proper author of this handbook. Jennifer Reinhardt could probably do it being a cat person herself. What remarkable talent! I found her illustrations funnier and more effective than the text that accompanied it. Each illustration captured what every cat owner (or cat owned human) has probably gone through. I give her illustrations five stars. I was thinking of returning this book but I decided to keep it anyway if only for Ms. Reinhardt's hilarious drawings."
5,Funny and unbelievably true!,"I picked up this book to browse through at an attorney's office while my husband and I were waiting to close on our home loan. Ten minutes is all the time I had to skim through it, however,that was enough to know that I must get this book for 2 family members for Christmas or birthday. It is truly a cat lover's book."
5,CATS FOREVER!,"I first bought this book over 25 years ago so this is my 2nd copy. Many people love ""a cat."" I love ""cats."" I have five. I imagine I am as close to the women in this book as anyone. I find it absolutely hilarious, but not unrealistic -- and I find it heartwarming. I smile deeply just knowing it's on my shelf. Ronnie, you've outdone yourself! Jennifer, your drawings are almost as perfect as the cats themselves! Thank you! If I felt the same way about any other animal (I do love dogs) I'd be knocking on your doors begging you to repeat your success."
3,Not Much History,"All in all an interesting read, however there is little in the way of actual history and anecdotes about this 'forgotten epidemic' - The book focuses far more on the modern day hunt for the virus than any sort of historical examination of what happened during the epidemic. An interesting read, however, people interested solely a historical examination of the virus should probably look elsewhere."
2,"Good facts, lousy characterization","Davies presents an entertaining (and sometimes chilling) summary of facts about the 1918 epidemic. More useful and interesting, however, are his summaries of more recent, even less well-known, events such as the 1997 Hong Kong outbreak and the 1976 swine flu debacle.It is interesting to note that his depiction of the men investigating the 1918 virus is universally glowing and complimentary, while his depiction of the women involved is either flat or entirely vilifying. His depiction of Kirsty Duncan seems particularly vitriolic, and one has to wonder if he was taking some cold shoulder just a touch too personally."
1,Disappointed,"This product came very quickly however I've already thrown it out. I was very disappointed. It doesn't clip onto the side very well, and once the grass starts growing, my cats want to eat it and it yanked out very easily. Another bad side effect is that it makes the water green and the sides all slimy. Great idea but fell flat. I'm so disappointed because one of my cats just loves eating grass and buying it at the pet store is so expensive."
2,Good Idea - But Some Concerns (Check Your Water Filter),"I bought this to spare my houseplants. In theory, this product is great. The grass grew pretty quickly, but after several days I noticed long, white roots hanging down in the cat's bowl. It seemed like the roots and the seed casings from the grass made the water bowl very dirty & I noticed the water flow wasn't as quick as normal. When I went to change the water filter, it was much dirtier than usual. I was a little concerned about the cleanliness of the water, so I've stopped using this product. I will say that our cat is a Maine Coon & they are known to play in their water - so it's possible the cat was pulling on the grass or trying to bat at the seed pod & made a mess of things. But, if I were still using the product, I'd be checking and changing the filter regularly."
1,Slimy water,"I thought this would be a great way for my kitties to enjoy grass. Instead it just made a big pool of slime in the drinking fountain and all over the filter (I had just put in). Even cleaning it every day wouldn't have prevented the slime from over taking the bowl. If you've ever had cut wild flowers .... and when you threw the flowers out, the slime and the smell that went with the slime ... is what you get when you grow this grass in your pet's water fountain.It's a great idea .... but wow, what a mess. I ended up letting it finish it's growth cycle in it's own bowl of water i changed every morning.Not worth the price at all.Sorry. :-("
3,Didn't fit real well.,"Our cat liked this grass and ate it; however, when they went to eat it the whole tray came off and after a few weeks it was hard to keep it attached. We ended up getting rid of it."
4,aqua garden,"This works very well for my cat although she tends to pull on the pod rather than just chew on it where it sits so it then leaves a water puddle on the floor also the fountain needs more cleaning since the roots of the grass grow into the fountain causing it to be scuzzy"" other wise i think it will work fine and keep my dogs and cat from eating my houseplants."
1,High Maintenance,"I enjoy this water fountain for my cats. I believe that one of my cats will not drink from it, so I keep a separate bowl of water for her. Different cats will have different preferences. This fountain MUST be cleaned once a week - especially if you are not using bottled water. You really need to pay attention to all parts - including the motor for ""guck"" & build up. If you are not going to clean it once a week, do NOT purchase it - the water will get bad and the cats won't drink it and they won't have any water. Do not bother with the aqua garden - it gets moldy in less than a week and you have to clean the fountain more than once a week. Other than high maintenance, I like having the fountain for my cats. I am not sure if they love it or it is just OK to them. I think it is just OK to them. None of them got excited about it. Personally, I'll keep my fountain going and clean it once a week!"
3,Solution to poor attachment?,"I've been using these for about a month now. I had the same problem with the attachment coming off so I taped it down with water resistant packing tape. Not the most visually appealing solution, but the grass stays in now so that my cats can enjoy it."
1,Don't waste your money,You can buy two pods at Petsmart for $6.99. This is a waste of money; I was very disappointed when I received this product.
3,s'all right,Grass is a little anemic without natural light. But it grows and the cats eat it. Cheaper than buying pots of grass at the grocery store.
3,Not made for Platinum Drinkwell models,"Nice idea for indoor kitties, but I had a couple of minor problems with this product. First, our Platinum model doesn't have a slot or hollow to receive the anchoring tab that is meant to hold the garden attachment in place. (Not a huge deal, but it might have made it easier for kitties to pull grass loose when it was partially-bitten off.) Second, as the seeds spent more time in the water, and the roots began to fill the main drinking area, I started to wonder whether the seeds had been treated with any chemicals that might affect the water. Organic seeds would be best, of course."
2,Not worth it,"I thought this would be great for one of my cats (who loves to eat anything green), and was hoping my other cat (who has urinary crystal problems) would get more interested in the water.The idea is great, but it doesn't really work so well. I had no problem snapping the frame onto the fountain. (I assume that the people who did, simply didn't push the clip down far enough to snap onto the ledge). My problem was with how foamy the water got, and then how slimy the fountain started to get. The grass is great, but the last thing I need is a reason to have to clean the fountain more often. I simply don't have the time.For now, the grass just lives in a plastic container of water. The cat seems to feel this is perfectly acceptable."
1,Disappointing,"The grass didn't grow very well. Granted, I didn't have the pet fountain in direct sunlight; it just isn't possible to place it where my cat can reach it and also be in the sun.Also, it created a white foam in the water, requiring me to change out the water and clean the unit weekly.Too bad, too, because I love the idea of it!"
3,cats,"My cats loved the cat grass. However, whenever they tried to eat it they would pull on the grass and the holder would come off the side. Then it would float in the bowl until I noticed it. It also makes the water kind of dirty and smelly if you don't clean it at least once a week. And even that can be too long. Must clean regularly!"
1,Pet Grass = Slimy Water,"We were very excited to get this attachment! Our cats love the fountain AND they love to eat grass, so we thought it would be a perfect match!Sadly, after about a week...the grass was growing, but so was lots of slime in our water! It messed up the water as well as all of the filters (which were also covered in a slimy film). It was a waste!"
2,Hasn't grown yet,"I've gone through three of these now and I've never gotten it to look like it does in the pictures. All that happens is that roots grow out of the bottom. My cat does sometimes eat parts of the roots, so I'm wondering if maybe she eats the grass before it can grow, but even so, I've never even seen a single blade of grass, only roots."
1,Made water slimy,"I keep the drinkwell in the shade so sun is not a factor making the water cloudy. I had to remove this product, scrub the entire unit and re-fill. Yes, it did look cool for a few days, but, it did not do what it said it would do (keep the water clean). I would not recommend this product since you will just have to toss it."
2,Drinkwell Aqua Garden,"This product works just as described and lasts quite a while. Unfortunately, my cats wouldn't eat it so I kept triming it down as it was growing so tall, it was falling over. Too expensive to try again."
1,Yuck!,"It seems like a good idea, but only a few thin blades grew in my case and more importantly, it created a disgusting foam in the water that made it undrinkable from my kitties' point of view. I have used Drinkwell fountains for over ten years with no problem. Skip the Aqua Garden."
1,It would be great if I didn't have cats,"I thought this would be a good idea as I've grown grass in plastic tubs for my cats before, but this implementation just doesn't work.The grass sprouts within a few days and the roots quickly fill up half of the fountain (I have the Drinkwell Platinum and it fits fine if you kept the adapter clip that came with the fountain itself). The only problem is the cats eat the grass as soon as it starts to grow upwards, so there's never more than a few smashed down blades of grass at one time. The grass never gets a chance to grow as pictured and they don't ever get that much to actually eat."
2,"Good idea, but not a solution","I echo the reviews of others who like the idea, but found the actual product unworkable. My cats are drinking much less from the fountain, there is foam in the water and slime forming on the surfaces, roots are growing into the bowl, etc."
2,Aqua garden grass ignored,I have 2 cats. It toOk a lot longer for the grass to grow than advertised. That was ok except my cats werent the least bit interested. Was a waste of money to me.
2,Not worth the money,"I purchase this seperately from my Drinkwell, the fountain itself has worked amazingly, and thought the garden a good idea since we currently have 3 cats in the household. It grew in the time frame expected, but just made the water mirky and kept shedding pcs of the grass into the water so my cats wouldn't really drink. Also, the pictures depict a standing grass, but it's very weak, so it bends over and just makes a watery mess. My cats also didn't seem very interested in nibbling on it as I expected."
4,Easy Garden,Our cat loves to munch on cat grass. We bought the Drinkwell fountain and saw this additional option offered so we decided to try it. Our cat really enjoys this combo of water and grass. I would certainly buy this product again.
2,"Interesting idea, but didn't work for me","This is a great idea. However, my cats did not like the grass in their water bowl. They would ignore it and seemed to drink less. Plus, the fountain itself quickly became dirty and needed cleaning. I also noticed that the grass only lasted a week or so before it started dying. Overall, I would recommend trying an alternative for your cat grass needs."
1,does NOT fit drinkwell platinum.,"can't see how this would fit the drinkwell platinum. nowhere in the description does it say this is only for the original drinkwell, and i can't find any way to attach it to my platinum. annoying."
2,Foamy water was a dealbreaker,"GOOD: The grass grew great, and one of my cats really liked it.BAD: The water got foamy and the filter turned green.Bottom line: It's just not worth it; would rather have clean, non-foamy water."
3,Cats didn't like it,The product performed as advertized but my cats refused to drink from the fountain until I removed the garden.
2,Not the best design,"I had high hopes for the aqua garden but the seed pod doesn't click into the holder, so when my cats go to nibble on the grass, the whole pod gets pulled out of the holder and fountain. I end up finding it all around the house. So the cats don't get to eat much of the grass because the pod doesn't hold still and the roots get all dried out. Not recommended."
2,aqua garden,"The grass grew slowly and one blade at a time. My cat would uproot each blade as it came up, so there was never a nice healthy patch of grass."
1,waste of money,"I bought this add on product to the Drinkwell fountain for my 2 cats. The grass grew beautifully...but, when the cats pulled at the grass, the whole cartridge came out of the fountain and I frequently needed to place it back where it was suppose to be. All in all..a good idea, but bad design. Save your money and don't purchase this product until the company comes up with a better design."
1,What Garden?,"I bought this for my Drinkwell Platinum which I and my cats love. However nothing green grew from the seed pod, just some white stringy things. Next time I'm not going to waste my time. I will buy $0.10 worth of barley grass and a little potting soil and grow my catgrass (barley grass) the right way. No fault of Amazon as a reseller but Drinkwell really needs to improve these or quit selling junk."
2,"great idea, not a great product","This is a fantastic idea, however it has some flaws. The grass grows pretty good, but the clip doesn't hold it on very well. The cats keep pulling it onto the floor, and get the grass out. I cut the grass for them, and place it on a plate so they can eat it."
2,Statistical Consultant,"This book is not useful at all to a beginning level student. You would have to have another book in addition to this one in order to be able to select the appropriate operations and complete them. In addition, the completed results shown are not presented in a way that is comprehensible to a beginning level student. All in all, this book is only useful for someone who already knows what to do and how to do it."
4,Good Book with Great Deal,"The book is handy and good reference for students of statistics and related disciplines. The downside perhaps, is lack of worked examples on most of the topics covered."
4,Exellent foundation for statistical analysis,"I bought this book because it was required for a course, but I plan to keep it. Easy to understand, well-written and clear explanations of various statistical measures and how to apply them, with good examples throughout."
5,You gotta get this book,"For the neophyte researcher/statistician, this is a must have. For those who've been around the block a few times, this is a text that helps put things into perspective, helps organize one's thinking from the beginning of a project right through to completion. It is a great reference. I'd suggest just leaving it on a shelf near your desk where you can reach over and take a look at the words of ""wisdom"" by these authors. Don't spend $50/hour hiring a consultant to help you with your statistics issues. Consult ""Your Statistical Consultant."""
1,Killing the American asparagus farmer,"Please do not buy Peruvian asparagus, even when it is labeled ""fair trade"" and ""sustainably harvested."" The US sends over 60 million dollars per year to Peru to encourage them to grow asparagus rather than cocaine. Then we spend untold barrels of fuel to ship it to the U.S. Meanwhile, Peru's neighbor Colombia picks up the cocaine crops, and the American asparagus farmer goes bankrupt. See the documentary *Asparagus - Stalking the American Life* about the plight of the Oceana County, Michigan asparagus farmers. And make sure you buy asparagus that was GROWN AND PROCESSED IN THE USA."
5,Educational and entertaining!,"Both my 14 mo old & 29 mo old boys love this video! The older one is just starting to pick up on the informative details in each song (13,000 pounds! 13,000 pounds) and the little one just adores the catchy tunes and great animal shots. I would never have imagined an aardvark to be one of their favorite animals!Similar to the Laurie Berkner video, it is one of few that will hold their attention for more than 5-10 minutes."
1,85H7YR Battery won't hold a charge,"The 85H7YR battery has been a great disappointment. It's installed in an 08 Corvette and, if left for two or three days, will not start the vehicle. The Chevrolet Dealer says the battery Warranty is only 3 years or 36K. Seems like the battery is promoted to have a longer Warranty than that."
5,Great Hype,"While the cynical members of the audience are going to worry about the ending not living up to the hype, the rest of the audience has every reason to be excited to see the final episodes. The characters have all had their chance to express how they feel about where they're headed and now it's time to get there. In the final three episodes, it will be time for Red Garden to answer all the questions that fans have. This is a series that continues to get better and will be hard to let go of when it ends."
3,this book does not have enough examples,"The qualitative analysis done in the book is excellent. However, there are not enough example to re-enforce the theory. When doing problems, I find them difficult to start. Also, many of the homework problems are similar, there can be different types of problems."
5,An excellent textbook.,This excellent introductory book provides a clear presentation about the field of semiconductors devices. The author not only has great efforts to make the material easy to understand but also has been careful to avoid compromising the accuracy and thoroughness of the material for which an understanding of the basic quantum mechanical concepts is necessary.
2,Not What I hoped for.,"For some, this would be an excellent DVD but not for me. All songs sounded the same to the point I could not tell when one ended and the next begain. Guess I was just expecting songs of faith. Oh Well, maybe the next DVD?"
1,A Ten-Track Disappontment,"It is impossible to be objective about this CD. I am personally such a fan of Jason and deMarco that I feel I am betraying them when I say thatI was almost relieved when I finally got to the end of this ten-track disappointment. There is so little difference between some of the cuts that one is almost unaware that it's another track; even the beat, the tonal inflections and artistic integrity are the same. The best part of this 1-star offering is the fact that I also own the CD from which this song was taken, ""Till the End of Time"", a 5-star gem that deserves a 6-star rating."
1,Unfabulous,"This product lives up to its name ""Unfabulous""I bought it for my 7 & 9 year olds a whole lot of reading and reading and no game playing.They did not like it at all."
5,FUN GAME..........,Ok.I first got this game last yare and and i chould not get past the the part where thay dance and i was like i hate this game i never will get past this part and so for a LONG TIME I HAVE BEN PLAYING IN THE ARCADE but than my nice friend offferd to help me and gusse what she got me throw that part and this is the funest game and i love the part when she gets to do tasks you are welcome for this good review.
3,Topping left me wanting more but...,"Panic didn't satisify.I won't hold my breath for the next Reese novel like I did for this one. I enjoyed both books, but Topping was far more complex and interesting. Panic feels like a rushed 'publisher pressure' follow-up novel. I know Reese can do better - I read her first book."
2,Once and Again?,"Essentially the same book as ""Topping from Below"". This update of the standard Gothic novel throws in a lot of S&M and a helping of bestiality. I would characterize it as ""Nancy Drew meets the Marquis de Sade"". The mystery was not particularly mysterious, the sex not particularly shocking and the characters not particularly likeable. Thing is, this author writes pretty well. Her prose flows smoothly and does not feel stilted or clumsy. I am assuming that, since her author photographs on the book jackets are obscured by shadow, she is using a pen name. Laura, whoever you are, give us a better book. Or have you already done so under another name?"
2,"disappointing after ""Topping from Below""","I am a big fan of Reese's first book, and bought this one despite the poor reviews. My expectations weren't high, but I guess I expected better from Reese since I was disappointed. The ending was almost exactly the same as ""Topping"" and there was very little character development. Not to mention that the erotic scenes were nothing like the first book!"
1,Disappointing 2nd effort,"After waiting for the 2nd book from author Laura Reese, it was hard to believe the same person penned both books. Her first book Topping From Below was an engrossing read from start to finish with characters you could explore. The characters in this book are flimsy, predictable, and have no depth. All in all, this was book was a complete waste of time and $$."
1,Just A Dull Clone of the first book...,"The first book was excellent. Panic Snap was a complete failure. I greatly anticipated this book, but it was nearly identical to Topping From Below, yet boring, if that makes any sense. (I hate to think L.R. lacks real imagination!)James and Carly were almost identical in personality to Michael and Nora. I also thought the end result of the plot very lame. There were so many wonderful ways the author could have solved the mystery of Carly's attack that would have been a lot more interesting than what she gave us.This novel was no match for the first one. I was totally disappointed."
2,Disappointing,Topping From Below was much more interesting. Panic snap has a slow start and not much to keep the pages turning. Somewhat disappointing.
2,same ol' kinky song and dance. . .,"Laura Reese is a truly gifted writer who, unfortunately, may also be a one-trick pony. TOPPING FROM BELOW, her first book, is one of my all time favorite novels. With PANIC SNAP, I see the author trying desperately to recreate the magic of TOPPING FROM BELOW. The plot is almost identical (female gets involved with sadistic lover in order to learn a ""secret,"" then falls in love with him, then exacts her revenge), but the writing isn't nearly as colorful or skillful. James McGuane, PANIC's resident sadist, is quite boring and not nearly as intriguing as TOPPING's antagonist. I hope that Laura Reese abandons the S & M theme in her next novel; otherwise, she'll just be beating a dead horse (pun intended)"
2,"Exactly the same plot as ""Topping from Below""","In her first book, Laura Reese, captured me. It was with great anticipation that I began reading 'Panic Snap', only to be dissapointed at the numerous similarities as 'Topping from Below'. It's as though she took the exact story line from her previous book and just changed the setting, characters and a few scenes. I was extremely dissapointed, especially at the ending, talk about duplication!! I would probably buy another book of hers, but first I would ask my friends if it was exactly the same as the first two,which wouldn't surprise me one bit."
3,Let Down,"Like the reader from San Antonio, TX, I was disappointed by Ms. Reese's second effort. I thoroughly enjoyed Topping From Below and anxiously looked forward to her new book. Unfortunately, I found the themes in Panic too similar to those in Topping. The characters were not as intriguing and the story was not as well developed. While I understood the motivations of the main character, I was left questioning the significance of the supporting characters. I will give Ms. Reese another try in her next endeavor, but I must confess that Panic Snap was a let down."
4,Try it!,"Good blend of mystery, suspense and erotica. The author grabs your interest in the beginning and holds it, as the main character Carly nervously awaits a verdict. As she contemplates the events which led to the moment, a story of physical and psychological submission unfolds, balancing dark erotica with suspense and mystery. Readers looking for a typical 'whodunit'may be in for a harsh introduction to the world of Dominance/submission, but satisfied with the mystery and suspense. Readers who enjoy BD/SM erotica will be pleased at the insight and understanding with which the author approaches D/s...appreciating her insight into Carly's helplessness, both physically and psychologically, as the 'control' subtly (and not so subtly) moves from one character to the next and back again."
4,Provocative and gripping -- great second effort from Reese!,"Laura Reese's debut effort, Topping from Below, has become one of my favorite novels. Its dark, sinister and controversial world enticed me. I couldn't wait to read Panic Snap.A victim of a mysterious accident that led to amnesia, Carly Tyler tries to put together the pieces of the puzzle that is her past, but she gets more than she bargains for.Despite some similarities to Below, Panic Snap follows Reese's tradition of illustrating the taboo subject of hardcore S&M; with a plot that twists all the way to the end. I didn't want this book to end -- and was savoring the final few pages. This is a tale by a master storyteller, without the bells and whistles that accompany most mystery/thrillers. I look forward to reading this skilled and gifted author's next project."
3,A Foot in the Past,"While just about every other COBOL textbook has adopted the use of scope terminators (such as END-IF) in COBOL programs, Paul Noll still prefers the old periods. Now that COBOL has scope terminators, the use of periods should be discouraged because they are known to make program changes more bug-prone. After all, the original intent of structured programming methods was to make programs less bug-prone."
