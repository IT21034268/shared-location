4,Cash Only,"Nice read, very quick and light. I found myself reading this book after watching the recent film. It gives the reader a deep look into the life of an anguished man from the cotton field hardships and the tragic death of his brother. The musical history was rich and informative, his attention to his audiences was a highlight. He lived a good life, not atypical of many stars during their era."
3,johnny cash,"as a big fan of the man in black i thought this would tell me more about the depths of him.....i noticed he kind of glazed over the relationship with his first wife and never went into any detail about the remenants of that relationship.....i am now reading ""I Walked The Line"" by Vivan Cash and i am getting more out of it. Other than that it was a decent read."
1,Very dissapointed,"I read good reviews but when I received the item and installed it there was not enough power to push the window up and barely enough power to pull it down. I have left it installed for now just to keep the window up until I can receive a replacement from another company, at which point I will hopefully return this one for a refund."
3,"1st one melted, 2nd works great","See title........1st unit's battery compartment, smoked and melted at contact points, YIKES. Notified vendor and they RUSHED a replacement to me. Works great. Fantastic sound for a ridiculously cheap price. Yes, your iPod/MP3 player is running on its own battery , big deal, whadcha want for $4-$6???????"
1,Not worth the $3,"Recently bought the speakers to take camping with my ipod nano. I tried it at home and the sound quality was terrible. Many songs came out fuzzy and even with the ipod and speakers at full blast, I had to hold it up to my ear to hear it. I could just blast the music over my earbuds and get the same sound from a few feet away. Needless to say, the speakers didn't make the trip."
4,Great Portable iPod Dock,"For those who are looking for a great little portable iPod dock with speakers, here's your answer. I use this little wonder when I go camping, great in the shower rooms or at home in your bathroom. Also looks good on your desk at work and it doesn't take up much room. The sound quality is not bad for a little device like this, granted it's not a stereo with top of the line speakers so don't expect it sound like it. It's easy to store, fold up and can fit in your jacket pocket or purse. So for all you iPod owners take a closer look at it, you won't be disappointed."
4,Won't Find Anything Better For The Price,"These little speakers are great! I was just using some extra money on a gift card and decided to order these. I was pleasantly surprised at how well they sound... Obviously, they don't sound like Bose speakers, but then again, they are 1% of the cost... I actually liked them so much I order 2 more sets as backups... They are great for us to take on vacation to the beach, take out on our deck and by the pool.... we have a lot of fun with them. The battery life is good, the only draw back is they do not come with an AC Adaptor. Other than that, I think this is a great product for the price...."
3,acceptable,"I am pleased with the sound quality. I just wanted something that sounded half decent so I could listen to my iPod instead of a cd player. It did not come with an ac adapter - I wish this was an option when buying it. I also am disappointed with the ""dock"". I have a nano and it fits in the allotted space IF IT IS NOT PLUGGED INTO THE SPEAKERS. Because the plug is on the bottom of the iPod, it can't sit nicely in the dock area. It still works though - thus the three stars."
4,Really Cute and pretty funny,"The appeal of this anime lies in the cute character designs and the dialogue. Not very much actually happens here. It's mainly just the characters sitting around and talking to each other. But their conversations and personalities make the show pretty funny. There is a character in this series that is obsessed with the Haruhi Suzumiya anime. I think that's kinda funny since the voice actor was the same as in that series too. There's not really much to tell about Lucky Star, but even if that's true it's still pretty cute and funny. You may like if you give it a shot."
5,Excellent video,"My husband is an invalid so he spends his time watching music videos such as Lawrence Welk. I gave him this one for his 79th birthday, he has played it many times and enjoys it more each time."
2,Not a complete guide,"This is mostly a picture book with very little detail. I read it in under an hour and still had no idea about issues like electrical, pump size, and caluculating flow for a waterfall. If I was in a brick and mortar store, I would have never bought this title. Instead, I have found a lot of use out of ""Ortho's All about Garden Pools and Fountains""."
2,Disappointing,The book has great pictures but no real detail about how to build ponds or waterfalls. How disappointed we were when we received the book. We will look for other books but will not purchase them online. We need to be able to see what is inside the cover.
3,Comic verse for the English reader,"This might be a book that appeals to the English reader,perhaps not so much to an American. The selections are, so to speak, tooprim and proper, too clean and literary. Some exceptions of course but not too many. No Little Willy rhymes, no Burma Shave ditties, no ""Maid from Nantucket"" type verses. Very few double dactyls and the included limericks are really not very amusing. Nothing vaguely resembling:When grandmama fell off the boat.And couldn't swim and wouldn't float,Matilda just stood by and smiled.I very nearly slapped the child.A great poem, wouldn't you agree?What I did learn from buying this book on line is not tobuy a book on line. Moral: When interested in buying a book, go to yournearest bookstore and sample the contents. Don't buy sight unseen."
4,Nice toy,"Nice toy. My 2 yr old toddler enjoys it. Just thought it would be a little bit bigger. Machine washable, so when it gets to dirty you can just throw it in the machine."
5,World's best and most intelligent PDA cover,"Until the early 90's all Palm-PDA cases in leather had one major inconvenient : The slightest pressure in the pocket or computer case would switch on the PDA - without you realizing it. You would eventually find out that the battery had turned low. The reason for this was a misconception of the case. Only the aluminum cases would avoid this problem, but this rigid case was not to everybody's liking. Palm ignored all claims in the meantime.Finally, in the mid-90's ,Covertec came to the rescue of Palm user and offered an intelligent leather case. They had studied the problem and developed an ad hoc case making sure that the leather cover would protect the PD from all pressure points eliminating the above-mentioned problem.Covertec deserves a lot of credit for this. Nowadays, Covertec leather cases are only sold by Amazon and some private second hand sellers."
4,"Fantastic quality, needs another slot","Beautifully made, highest grade leather, but not enough credit card slots to suit my needs (cash pocket would have been nice, which is why I sent this back and went with the similar Piel Frama black leather case."
5,A haunting masterpiece of neo-classical beauty,"Kris Force's soaring voice captivates you from the first track to the last. With a decidedly unique neo-classical sound this CD is composed of not just songs, but modern ballads of haunting effect. This album is proof against those that claim classical instrumentation is boring or stale. Indeed the mix of cellos, violins, guitar, and percussion are anything but. The dark mood of this album only accentuates its beauty. All in all it is one of the best collections of modern ballads in existence."
4,practical and easy to read,"I bought this book used and all i can say is that it's one of the most useful i've read of this nature... it's really a shame it wasn't re-released...the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is that i haven't quite finished it. jam-packed with information, yet a very easy read."
1,"if you want to throw away money,no choice could be better","First:who said that grind-core has to be only noise?that surely is what this japanese band is thinking.Every one could have made this album,since playing instruments without knowing how is what they wanted.So if you like listening to about 55 identical songs in about 25 minutes go ahead. growwtatatatbaaa:that is how it sounds."
3,cd lacks vinyl cover,"I own the 12in of this album and I must recommend that anyone who is thinking of getting this album try their hardest to find the vinyl version. The cover photo for the 12in, a huge b/w closeup of an (...) that is colored pink gives this album the most beautiful cover I have ever seen. It is worth owning it just to leave out by your stereo. The CD lacks this. I personally find this version of noise slightly boring. Merzbow has done better music. No one has produced a nicer cover."
2,Whatever happened to Bustmonster?,"Masami Akita has done some seriously fun punk over the years along with his noise stylings. In particular, Bustmonster, a collaboration with Hong Kong noizhead xper. xr. and a few others, is fantastically funny stuff. Charming, naive, thoroughly no-fi. Even the cover is xeroxed. Pure DIY punk/noise.That said, this release is painful. I love Merzbow, but even I find this relatively unlistenable. The internal rhythms and undercurrents that hallmark Merzbow's wall-o-noise-era material are absent here, and the sense of whimsy that drove projects like Bustmonster is also absent. One wonders, on occasion, if the recording equipment was actually broken. This is noise to sleep to."
4,Classic treasure for a physiatrist,"Thank you for your immediate delivery to the far East, rising sun country. This book is classic but still brilliant in the content or philosophy for the people who are studying rehabilitation medicine. Unfortunately, no detail on the author's career was written in the book. Thus, it is difficult to introduce who he is for the young readers."
5,Universal appeal - more than just sci-fi,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film - I don't consider myself a sci-fi fan at all, but that element is secondary to the twisty plot, depth of characters and amazing scenery/music of this movie. The attention to detail in the scenes is impressive, and the depth of the musical scores surprised me. This is a sweepingly great film, and my only regret is that it's on the big screen so I can see it in better detail."
1,Refund please!,"Okay, this would have been fine if I had been in High School and it was produced by some of my buddies. However, this is not the case. It was the worse acting and writing that I've ever had the displeasure to watch. For example, they hear a loud sound and run to the top of a hill. One of the actors stands looking at the source of the sound in amazement while the other actor looks at him wondering what he's looking at...as if he couldn't see the huge OCEAN right in front of him. I guess I'm SOL in getting my money back!"
1,Terrible. Avoid,This is a really terrible film with some of the worst acting I have ever seen. Do not make the mistake of renting. You will regret it.
4,These up-and-coming filmmakers prove they can captivate you with a small budget and great writing!!!,"These filmmakers did a fantastic job with limited resources. As a screenwriter and having worked as a production hand in Hollywood for many years I think I know a good film when I see it and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this film! These boys did a truly fantastic job. The acting is good; the plot and premise are fantastic! As far as I'm concerned, they prove it's possible to captivate an audience on a small budget as long as your story is good. I have to say, they did a better job than most directors can do with a full crew and seven figure budget!!!WATCH OR DIE!"
1,bad acting,"This is a Horrible movie, Terrible acting, Low budget film, Did not even watch half of this movie. A waste of money."
1,I Wish I Could Get A Refund,"I didn't expect much. I figured I was supporting an ""indie"" flick.Instead, what I got was a high school project.A BAD high school project. I have seen far, far better.To say the acting was ""wooden"" would be an insult to dead wood.Character development? We've heard of it.Costume design? Here's ten bucks. Get something futuristic.I suspect the only reason that it made it this far, is because the folks who made it must be the scion of some rich and famous folks.Also: Don't believe the positive reviews on this. Obviously ringers. I would have given it a couple of stars, just because this was somebody's baby, but the astroturf positive reviews made me realize that the decision I made to ""support an indie flick"" was a stupid one. This should be a solid one- or two-star flick: MAXIMUM."
3,TOO SLICK,I had hoped to use the glove to grasp and land a live fish. Its surface is too smooth/slick for this. It needs to have a rough surface for this purpose.
2,Dissapointed,"The instrument looks great with great features, however the readings are not consistent. Even had a doctor check it, confirmed that the readings are not consistent hence not reliable."
3,not the best of their series but still good,"It's a simple 4 drawer unit made awesome because it goes with the drawer and cabinet of the same series. I've used mine for almost a year. I own the entire series and am very glad to have bought them, mostly because they go together like legos and hold alot of stuff. They have yet to break down or otherwise disappoint me. However, I give THIS one 3 out of 5 because not only is it very difficult to maneuver around once it has stuff in it, but the top of it is not completely flat, and also the weight of the top drawers sags the bottom just enough to make the lowest drawer difficult to open and close after a while. This might be OK if you put stuff in there that you know you wont need very often."
4,Maybe Cheaper Elsewhere,"This is high quality for plastic storage. However, you can buy this for $60 at Home Depot and Walmart as of this date: 01/02/2009"
5,Robust and fast delivery,"Found it robust. It was delivered pretty fast. However, there are some manufacturing defects, however, I am not keen about aesthetics and anyway the moulding defect was on backside. On bottomside it looked little bit unfinished."
3,The smell?,"I bought this for around $65.00 at Walmart, and it has been great storage for my room, which is finally clean. However, it wouldn't come apart except for the bottum drawer that fell out, and since then it has had some strange and annoying smell in it. That sharp smell is still there after cleaning it."
1,horrible product that comes with bedbugs! + awful cust svce,"BUYER BEWARE! I bought this new & they sent me a used unit that had stains on it; this should have been a tipoff; though they discounted it, I LEARNED IT HAD BEDBUGS!a complete loss for me as I had to throw it out; STAY AWAY!"
3,Love the product but....,I love this 4-Drawer unit but it said it was supposed to come with wheels and my unit did not :(. I am missing the holders for the wheels and the wheels themselves. The unit itself though seems very sturdy and well made. Holds my boys very well :)
5,Sterlite 4-Drawer Storage,"It is a nice weight, drawers slide easily, and it came ready to use right out of the box!Perfect for extra storage in garage."
4,Very nice item,"Works perfectly for me. I'm using it as a dresser in my closet.The drawers slide out so smoothly, and it feels really sturdy."
5,My dresser,"The Sterilite 4-Drawer Unit is large enough for holding all my socks, underwear, and the occasional t-shirt yet small enough to fit perfectly inside my closet. The durable plastic and easy sliding drawers have held up nicely over the past two years with daily use. I like it so much that I am planning on purchasing a second one to hold my expanding sock collection."
5,A must have dresser,This product is fantastic. It's light - easy to more around - and almost indestructible. i've given several to college students and have received all compliments in a positive mode. I even have two of my own. Great for storing Xmas decorations or paper work storage. I also use it for a guest dresser when company comes. It looks good - it performs well. What more can you ask. BUY IT
4,"Works as expected, top is not completely flat","Works like you would expect rolling drawers to perform. My only complaint is that the top of the unit isn't completely flat. It pops up in the middle, and you can push it down, like the safety button on a jar lid. It's a very minor issue though.I put a 50lb printer on top recently, and it holds it very nicely. Doesn't even bend or dip, I like it!"
1,booo,didn't receive the bit pictured. received a far inferior product. the bit pictured is a good bit and have used them for years. but received a cheap piece of crap instead.
3,Program,"Everything its ok the USB cable works the program also, but the ringtones, pictures,wallpapers,gifs are awfull. My phone is Sanyo SCP8100, there's not much stuff you can do with it. The good thing about the Program is it can be used with many Sanyo phones."
5,Excellent book!,"Really good intro to Chinese! The language use and content are current, not like something people would say 100 years ago.Topics are especially good for college students."
5,Queer as Folk,"I haven't bought this book, but I read the preview section that they have and can't wait to buy it! Everything seemed to be correct except for the shell bracelet. In the show, season 3, when Brian's nephew is being a homophobic punk, he steals the bracelet and tells the police that Brian molested him. Justin goes to his nephew at the arcade and tries to convince him to tell the truth, when he notices the bracelet. To convince the police his nephew is lying, he gets Detective Horvath to the kids' house, Horvath asks for the bracelet and Justin says, ""He got it in Mexico. His initials are carved on one of the shells.""Here, it says he got it from Micheal for his 18th birthday."
1,never read the book but I have to clear somethings up,First of all Brian and Lindsay dated in COLLEGE not high school Jack met here in college Lindsay and Brian have said that a ton of times on the show and I hate to say this but I have too the Fact that the author steals Last Dance from Brian and Justin actually made me not buy this book besides if I want fanfic I can go to Randall Morgan for it.
3,Every Nine Seconds---could be better,"I just finished reading this book. It is sweet and clever in places. It gives a plausible background to the characters of Brian and Michael and how their friendship evolved. However, on pages 130-131 a scene occurs in a state liquor store of a meeting that is totally out of character of the entire book. It changes the entire mood of the book. I almost closed the book and threw it away. Instead, I just whited out the lines that were so offensive to me. It ruined the entire book. I did trudge through the rest of the book and found it enjoyable. I still think it needs a rewrite, but I do demand perfection for my favortie show."
3,Enjoyable Piffle,"Lightweight and enjoyable ride for dyed-in-the-wool QAF fans. Quite cannily written...as the majority of hardcore QAF fans are apparently female, the book has a distinct ""chick-lit"" flavor. Right, chick-lit with a bunch of hot gay sex scenes. Oddly, it works, much the same way the show did. One may quibble with small facts, e.g. the origin of the shell bracelet, but the characters are consistent with as earlier versions of those on the show."
3,A Quickie,"I really enjoyed this book, though its not the best. There is some discrepancy from the show, but if you can get past that its a fairly decent read. Telling the tale of Mikey and Brian, honestly you really couldn't go wrong. I felt it stayed true to the chacters to the best of its ability. It even made them deeper as their past is often discussed on the show but obviously not to this depth. If anything its worth the time (and its a very quick read) just so you can read Never Tear Us Apart which I loved."
2,Where did the ending go?,"I hate to admit I never had the opportunity to watch QAF, so this book left me confused. I wish it was written to stand on its own. I imagine as it is part of a series I shouldn't be disappionted by the end. But? What the heck was that all about? The characters were decently written, though I kept asking myself why Micheal wanted that jerk Brian when he treated him like poo. I suppose you have had to be a fan of the series. I'm sorry I wasn't because this one just couldn't stand on its own."
3,Good Read,"I must say although I enjoyed reading the book I feel that it could have been much stronger if provided with more history as to how the two met and became such good friends. But, the book started off in much the same way as the series with Michael portrayed as a spineless follower that allowed his friend to have all the fun while he waited to clean up his mess. Don't get me wrong out of all the characters Brian is my favorite. But, just once I would have loved to see Michael get the guy that was placed under that infamous Brian Kinney spell. In addition, I feel the liquor store scene could have been left out. It was something I had a hard time getting passed once I read it. But, all in all I did enjoy the book and look forward to the next installment."
3,Good but leaves you wanting,"The book is much like the television show, it is only good during the sex scenes. Fortunately this book is full of erotic moments."
2,boring storytelling,"Could the novel get anymore trite? After the great writing on the show, I expected a little more than a middle school romance novel. And could the characters be any more one dimensional? Brian is the cool soccer dude who no one can believe is a fag yet he hits on guys all the time? Hmmm. And the sex scene with his soccer coach? How unnecessary. It's like one minute it's a young (and I do mean young) adult novel and then it's soft core porn. And Michael couldn't be more pathetic...at least on the show he has balls every now and then. He just appeared clueless throughout the novel. Too clueless for a gay boy in high school--that's for sure. Gee let's play a prank at the high school graduation...Gee wonder what Brian is going to do...Gee how more lame can I get?"
4,From TV to text,"I recommend it to any viewer of the show.It's what you expect from watching the show. It explains some things greatly, diving right into the nitty-gritty shortly after it begins. Not the greatest writing. :( but you get over that semi-quickly because of the great plot. I loved it, very sweetly going through Michael & Brian's relationship. Word of warning, if your an adamant reader, you might not feel all of the bang for the buck because you realize that the text is pretty large and it's a realativly short and easy read. It's great for smooth Sunday afternoons, you really get into it.I will definitely buy the rest of the series. :) WORD OF WARNING: Buy them together, because once you finish this one, you'll want the next one right away."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Boring! Man, was this book bad. And who's asleep at the switch when it comes to continuity? In the book, we're told that Brian's seashell bracelet is a gift from Michael. Yet two weeks ago on the show we're told by Justin that Brian bought the bracelet in Mexico. Which is it? Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. I'll pass on the next novel."
4,An enjoyable read,"I have never seen the show and opened the book based soley on the back cover copy. I really enjoyed it and will read the others and also will likely watch the dvds now. It was a nice, fun book."
4,One of the best I've seen,"I own several different bellydance dvds and have rented countless others from Netflix, and I have to say that ""Pure Technique"" is one of the best I've seen.This dvd assumes you have at least a smattering of knowledge of basic beginner bellydance and does an excellent job of building off of a basic foundation. 22 moves are broken down and demonstrated and almost all are given multiple variations as well.I didn't rate this 5 stars for two reasons.1= No breakdown or reminders about the importance of proper posture. Yes, it's totally basic, but it is terribly important in order to avoid strain to the low back area.2= Undulations. I can't put my finger on it, but they just looked a bit sloppy to me. (not that I'm an expert) Not done as well as I've seen elsewhere"
3,fair enough if you want hips that won't quit,"After doing this video once, I got a little bored even though I have anything but mastered the movements. I have come up with a few ways to get around this. Each movement is done at half time and then sped up, depending on the step I will either do it a few times and then skip to a more challenging movement or I will skip the half time and do it on my own beat. the later movments introduce some combinations you will use later. This video is also good if you want some help stabilizing your core. Another thing I do is play music over the drum beats, this usually gives a more challenging tempo. There are 3 main combinations where Shamira calls out the movements and you have to follow, the first one I haven't done since the first time I watched it because it is very slow and boring, while the other two get progressively more difficult. The video is mirror image, you should be able to follow."
2,Pretty bad,"I was snookered by the other reviews. It is unpolished, her instructions are not at all what I would have expected. It is pretty awful."
5,Excellent,The disk contains a very thorough break down of three dance routines. Shamira explains each move and practices it with different variations. Fun and sensuous at the same time. I really enjoyed this disk. Good job!
3,A lot of good moves,"Great technique practice. However, it is an indoor video (unlike the cover claims to be by the ocean)"
5,Cute as can be,"I purchased this ornament for my son for christmas. He plans to become a doctor and had attended a medical conference this summer,so this was the perfect ornament for him. It is high quality and just too cute."
3,Too slow!,I've read the other books in the series...a relaxing bed time read. This one seems somehow more tedious. I've gotten bogged down in it.
2,Not really worth it,"The only reason why I give this book 2 stars is because it will still give you a feel for the format of the test. The answers in the back can be wrong- and often times are. It's pretty frustrating when you are absolutely certain that you are right, yet the book is telling you you're not. Unfortunately there are not many books on the market to help you prepare for this test. So, if you must, buy this book. But beware...answers cannot always be trusted."
3,"Entertaining, But Not Terribly Informative","I enjoyed reading Sanoe's book on the surf life, though I had hoped for more intruction on surfing itself. The voice of her book is more geared toward the younger set, and includes some facts, but not enough to get you past the beginner's stage. I'd recommend this to teen girls who are interested in surfing in a more recreational sense, but this book is not for adults who wish to dig in to detail."
2,Palm TX Case with Belt Clip,"After using another style flip case for a few months, I decided to get one that had a belt clip. During my search, the only leather case I found that was designed to support my PDA w/a belt clip was Prima by Bellagio Designs. There was nothing to really compare it to but, I took a chance. Unfortunately, several things annoyed me about the product:1. It was extremely difficult to slide the PDA onto the leather wrapped support hinge2. When you engage the PDA onto the belt clip it swivels and moves way too much which causes the PDA to rock back and forth when walking. It just doesn't seem secure.3. The expansion card slot and the slots for business cards are extremely tight AND upside down. Not very user friendly or practical.If you can get over all the downs, the up would be the softness of the leather. Very nice to the touch."
2,2 stars and three yawns!,More like Duchess for a Few Months! I bought this book on recommendation and was rather disappointed. Perhaps I thought the heroine in the novel was actually going to be a duchess for a 'day' but that actually wasn't the case at all. I was looking forward to reading about her debut into high society only to have it glossed over... the reader is cheated out of hearing how her introduction into society went. We are just to assume that it was a success. I think this book had the potential to be much better.
1,Lazy answering machine ... won't take your call.,"This AM is a piece of junk, don't waste your money. The best it can do is answer the call, make the caller believe they are leaving a message, cut them off in mid-sentence and then delete whatever was recorded so you have no idea if anyone called or not. Junk!"
2,Antique Map,"The product itself was fine, but carelessly mounted and crooked. I am handicapped, with limited use of my hands. It took me over two hours to correct the problem, whereas it would have taken no more than an additional 5 seconds for the original installer to have done the job properly in the first place"
5,WOW!,"This book is incredible and lives out to its title! I knew the author personally and it was just INCREDIBLE to see in the book how the man thought and how he was able to express what most of us are thinking and not being able to say. I offer incredible props to Mr. Cappola, and I just hope that he will continue to write for the people who can't write due to work conflicts, school, etc. More power to Mr. Cappola and thank you for writing your book! 5 stars!"
2,childish,"I think I wrote like this when I was a child, I think ! Outrageous I must say is exactly just that. Aside from being written by a 5 year old, it does make you wonder,laugh & talk. Use spell check next time."
3,Decent story. Glad the trilogy is over.,"I must say that I've enjoyed the first four MTG books. Clayton Emery has done an admirable job of bringing the magic of Dominia to the pages of novels, as well as creating a nice story with engaging characters and a pretty exciting plot. However, I am glad that this story has come to an end and more of the world of MTG can now be explored.In Final Sacrifice, Gull and Greensleeves continue to barely survive fight after fight against a team of wizards that they have thwarted in the past until Greensleeves eventually just snaps and nearly destroys everything around her. The ending of the book comes as somewhat of a surprise, with characters from the past reappearing and the ""final sacrifice"" not being what you'd expect.Another quick, easy, and enjoyable read, I'd reccomend it for someone looking for a short and relaxing read."
5,Finally what I wanted!,"I was looking a long time for some great fantasy book whith the good, beautiful yet extremely powerful sorceress in the main role. This trilogy and especially 'The Final Sacrifice' fulfilled all my demands at 100%. I can only mourn there isn't more books like this."
5,A wonderful endig to the trilogy,Clayton Emery has ended the Magic Trilogy with a surprising ending. He describes every fight to the smallest detail making you feel like you're there. If you would like to talk to me E-mail me.
3,At the least the trilogy is over,"The book brought to conclusion the stories found in the two previous books. I have to admit, it was tough to read it. Boring at times, character flaws. I gave 3 stars becuase the last chapters made up for it. I must confess that I really felt bad for Greensleves. This proves that after three books, those characters, mostly Greenselves and Gull, really grew on me.I have not used this one with my students."
5,GREAT price,"These filters are hard to find in the stores and when you do find them, they are over $10/each. Here, I found them for around $5/each and with free shipping- a no brainer!!!"
4,Just As Described,Fits exactly as described in my Vicks humidifier. A very good deal here on Amazon. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs these replacement filters.
3,Question about first use of filter,I have used this filter before and thought it worked well. But now I can't remember about installing it in the humidifier. My replacement filter box contains no instructions about first use. Am I supposed to soak the filter in water before installing? Any help would be welcomed.
4,Good stuff,This is great. Last longer than the older one that hard not wires in it. Bought a few to keep .
3,Ok Filter,"I brought these filters to go with my childs humidifier. I had to shape the filter to fit properly, but other than that it works fine."
4,turns brown quicker than i thought!,When I bought the machine it said to change the filter two times a year but this thing turns brown quicker than i thought so i may have to change more often we shall see.
2,Filters don't last very long,"We used these in our Vicks 1 Gallon Cool-Mist Humidifer, and each time I replaced the filter it would only last 2-3 weeks. These filters are a little pricey, so the maintenance cost for the humidifier quickly added up.We kept the humidifier running 24 hours a day in my sons nursery so that it was always on and ready to go when he went down for naps and bedtime. Maybe if you didn't run the humidifer for such long periods the filters would last longer."
4,Good Value,These are a good replacement filter for Vicks Humidifier and a lot cheaper than buying in store.
1,A word of warning,"This review isn't about the product itself, but the description that Amazon has. The item title is ""Protec WF2 Extended Life Replacement Humidifier Filter, 2 Filters (Pack of 3)"". This suggests that each box contains 2 filters and they are sold in a pack of three boxes. In a casual glance at the box picture, you can make out a ""2"", but that two doesn't pertain to the number of filters. If you zoom in on the box, the text on the bottom does say ""1 filter"".So just be aware, contrary to the title you're buying a grand total of 3 filters. Amazon needs to correct their description. I tried to call their customer service, but they were completely unhelpful about it."
4,Product was just as advertised,Product arrive on time and in good shape.This was as good if not better than the orginal that came with the machine
4,Works well,"Many gave this product not such a great write up. However, the filter seems to be working just as well as the one that came with my Vicks Germ Free humidifier. So far, so good."
4,filter,"This product fits perfectly in the Vicks Humidifier I have. The filter can be washed once without falling apart, so I use less filters."
1,Poor Wicking and Mold,"I bought two three packs at the beginning of December for two humidifiers we use throughout the winter months. Within a week; the humidifiers output had decreased and mold began forming at the top of the wicks; we replaced them thinking it may have been due to our not cleaning the humidifier very well; so we cleaned the humidifier, use distilled water and again within a weeks, very dank smell and black mold appearing in the wicks. They just do not seem to wick very well and we are now on our last set of wicks - No wonder they sell them in three packs; that's how many you will need! Three in three months is too many; last year we purchased filters from Target (wish I could remember the brand) and they lasted all season with no problems. I do not recommend these filters."
4,This fit really good,This fit the humidifier really well. I was pleased to find a replacement as the one I had was falling apart. I can't seem to find a replacement in the stores.
5,Fits good/works good,Works great in my Vicks humidifier.It's been a month of heavy use and there's no build up on it yet.
3,Humidifier filter,"This product is better purchase online than in local store. The original filter didn't have a plastic seam, which is hard to adjust to the machine. But once you get it it works fine."
4,Great buy,The Kaz WF2 filter is very good. It last for along time.Kaz WF2 Extended Life Replacement Humidifier Filter (Pack of 3)
2,Wish they lasted longer.,"I purchase these every year for my Vicks humidifier. I have spent way beyond what the machine itself cost me on filters. Each filter lasts about a month to 6 weeks before getting moldy and stops wicking the water. I only use the humidifier for about 4 months in the Winter, which a 3 pack of filters is good for. I would use it all year if I did not have to keep replacing the filters. If someone knows a better choice of longer lasting filters, please post.12/9/08-Too bad this is the only place I have easily found these. I cannot believe they have gone up $10 in cost since I purchased them a year ago (11/30/07)!"
2,"Three years using them, but solely due to lack of better options.","I've used a humidifier that requires these for the past three winters, and really am not happy with the entire situation. These last only a month or slightly longer before needing to be replaced, so they simply are way overpriced for what they provide.It feels like I'm getting suckered by a racket. Just out of principal, I'd much rather buy a humidifier that's higher performing and spend the extra money there rather than having to deal with ordering two packs of these per winter. They're bulky to store and it's just a hassle."
3,Disappointing for the price,"I bought these filters to replace the original filter in my Vicks Cool Mist humidifier. In the winter I use my humidifier a lot (all night and often during the day). What was disappointing about these filters was that the metal reinforcements put into the filters rusted within a day of placing them in the humidifier. This made it hard to tell when the filter was worn out (and it just looks gross). I used each filter for about a month, and for ~$20 per set, they seemed too expensive for the amount of time they lasted. I also bought some Pro Tec Humidifier Tank cleaners ([...]) and they seemed to make the filter last a little longer, but, of course, didn't solve the rust problem."
3,"Good, but I like her others better.","This is a live recording of some songs which are on her other earlier CDs. This onbe is a little more raggedy, by still interesting. It is not a subdued as the others, Tapestry of Carols, and Carols and Capers. Those are both excellent, and I would recommend those first. If you like those, you can think about this one a little more."
2,Deeply Flawed,"This book suffers from a number of major problems, but the main one is that it's incredibly predictable. I have never in my life seen a horror movie, and I've read a grand total of two thriller novels, but despite being totally unfamiliar with the genre, I was never once surprised or caught of guard. I guessed which characters were going to survive and which were going to die when I was maybe a fourth through the comic, and the ending was [bad] and predictable. Add to that the fact that none of the characters were even remotely interesting or well-developed, and the result is a very poor comic indeed."
3,ute i really like her,ute.....i really like nearly everything you do...your singling ismore than just singing....it is a type of art presentation.....she sings...yes...she dances....she talks....and it is amazing towitness....it is rare to see any performer that can entertain on a globalscale....most sing or act in their native language....take it orleave it...with ute; there is something for everyone....
3,Hauntingly beautiful,This is well written darker music. It's hauntingly beautiful. We use it (and others) as background for D&D campaigns.
5,A dark and delicious treat!,"I've always been a fan of horror soundtracks, and I'd have to say that this CD ranks right up there with the best of them. At times subtle and chilling, at others fervent and passionate, I found it to be both original and positively infectious. The orchestrations range from hauntingly sparse to powerfully grandiose, and are quite effective in representing the various aspects of a truly classic creature. Well done, gentlemen!"
5,The Perfect October Soundtrack...,"Midnight Syndicate has become a Halloween tradition for me. Light some candles, turn the lights down, prop up your feet and let the haunting melodies set the mood. ""Vampyres"" is yet another great CD from the Syndicate. I found this release to be even better than some of their earlier CD's. Tracks 2,6,8 and 11 are my stand out tunes. If you haven't heard these guys before and enjoy instrumental music with a Halloween flavor then this CD (or any of their other ones) is a must."
3,Good atmospheric stuff but....,If you like their other albums you will like this. If you don't you will not want to touch it with a very long pole. I do have to admit that their albums are beginning to sound the same so I doubt I will be buying any more. Once you have one disc of heavy synth / gloom material you don't really need another.
1,This is getting boring.,"I had picked up the first couple CD's by this band and really liked them. I have to say that I am starting to get bored with them. I am sure that they are accomplished musicians but there is so little they have to work with. There are times when this disc sounds very sterile and synthetic. One can't help but feel the production is a little cheap. For some reason (and I don't know why) this one doesn't hold up to the others. Actually, I started to tire of Midnight Syndicate with their last release so I don't even know why I bothered at all. In all reality, the music is good but it doesn't hold up to repeat listenings (as is true with most instrumental recordings of this nature). I suppose one could pull this out during Halloween for a party or when passing out candy to the kiddies but that's about it. I see that they have a new disc on the way. I can only hope it's better than this or that they try something new. This is getting boring."
3,Not bad,"This is not that bad, as previous report put it. This music is created for playing background, for example, when I'm cleaning up my room, I put this, or when I'm killing people, I also put it in the walkman - I mean, this music creates an atmosphere, while still it doesn't disturb you neither interrupts in what you're currently doing, you keep on being concentrated.But, for example, such songs as ""blackest rose"", is very good even if being carefully listened. It is not that bad, really."
2,Okay...,"Eh, I didn't think much of this cd. I've heard scarier or better gothic atmosphere music from video games. It seems to plod on and on and every track sounds like the previous one or something you've heard a hundred times before."
2,"No Signal, no atomic clock, reduced battery life","I live in Forest Hills, Queens (New York City) and I cannot get a signal (for the atomic clock) despite my best efforts, moving it to different areas of my house. Furthermore, although the display is crisp and clear, the forecast symbol is animated, which can be an eye sore for some.Also, it's probable that electric functions trying to pick up a signal that it can not, is wasting battery life, so that's another strike from the 5 stars it started with."
2,Small,This clock is very small and hard to read at any distance. It would be best for a desk so you could be sitting right next to it and be able to read it.
3,underpowered or overpriced,"neat idea, but the product itself is lacking. it does the job, but it seems in a less than amazing way. get the temp and other readings as described."
1,Unreliable (have two units),"I have bought two of these sets (but about a month apart, so they shouldn't be the same production run). Both of the wireless remote sensor links stopped working after about six months. BOTH WERE PURCHASED ON AMAZON, but one was through an Amazon-affiliated vendor. Oregon Scientific would not honor the warranty, even though the unit was brand-new. It's not an issue with the batteries- tried lots of things to get them working, and called support a couple of times.I am utterly unimpressed and disappointed with Oregon Scientific and their unreliable products. Being an electronic design engineer, I can see they could have done much better to make a quality product. Now I know why they look for loopholes to avoid honoring their purported warranty. AVOID this!!!"
3,Weather Forecaster review,"The clock works great. I had a lot of difficulty finding a place in my house where it picked up the signal giving the outdoor temperature and weather forecast. Once I did find a good place, that worked well too."
2,"Good clock, not so much everything else","This is great for the clock. Thermometer and hygrometer (moisture sensor) are too far off. Thermometer reads ~4 degrees off my professionally calibrated one. Hygrometer is the most unpredictable thing I've ever seen. Sometimes it's within 1% point of my professional one, other times its 10% points off. The outdoor unit's accuracy is even worse. Units are fine if you just need a guess. But if you're looking for any semblance of accuracy, go elsewhere."
1,"Good Looking, but worthless","This is a nice looking weatherstation with lots of features.Unfortunately it could not link with the atomic clock, although I am within half of the range - even outdoors.Also, the humidity indication is woefully inaccurate. The base unit indicated 13%, the remote unit showed 22%, while my calibrated hygrometer measured 36%. I do not have a calibrated thermometer, but at least both showed (nearly) the same temperature.In summation, it's a nice looking thing, but inaccurate; and for that it is a bit pricy.Finally, for those who care: although the device can be switched to french & german languages, it does not have a 24 hour clock mode."
1,Oregon Scientific Weather Forecaster,"I purchased 2 of these, used one as a gift. Fortunately, the gift product worked. The one I saved for myself did not work (the remote device apparently was defective). After communicating with Oregon Scientific, they gave me a RMA number to return the product, which I did at an additional expense of $4.00. That was a couple of weeks ago and I have received/heard nothing since."
4,Pretty good Weather Meter,This is a pretty good weather meter. It does everything as expected. The forecating is a little off. Once you reset it a few times it gets better. It is definitely worth the money.
5,A Picture Book for Middle Schoolers,"The Other SideI used this picture book to teach symbolism to my middle school students. My students connected Woodson's fence to Jerry Spinelli's Hector Street in our class novel, Maniac Magee. After an engaging reading,they concluded that both the fence and Hector Street represent that which divides us: ignorance. Picture books, especially The Other Side,are excellent tools for teaching literary elements. Most importantly, students of all ages enjoy them."
4,The Other Side Review,"Do you like sad, heart-touching children stories? Then you would love, The Other Side. It's a children's story by Jacqueline Woodson. The main characters are of different race, and they end up getting along very well and becoming friends. The main idea of The Other Side is that people, especially kids, can get along with someone even though they are different.Another main point is that children can teach adults a lot about getting along and accepting people for who they are. The book is written for children to understand and also for adults to learn about how it was for children and parents in the past. The Other Side is a great realistic fiction book and will teach people of all ages about history of segregation."
3,OK.,"This book is good. Let's start there. It's an excellent way to open the subject of racism to a young child. But that's the key. Young child. It was a good to start a conversation with my 8 year old, but I think this would be better suited for the PreK to maybe first grade? I would recommend this book as a library book. I will say the one thing I really enjoyed was the imagery. High marks to the illustrator. The illustrations really capture the mood of the book."
5,This is a fantastic book1,"Beautiful pix, fantastic message. I read it to my 4th graders for MLK day and we had a great discussion about author's message."
5,Knocking Down the Fence of Prejudice,"As a former teacher and volunteer I read this picture book to library classes of grades 1 and 2, though even junior high students would enjoy it. It treats the subject of prejudice on a level that children can ""appreciate"" and can become engrossed in. A fence running through the center of town separates blacks and whites, yet two children finds in this fence a loophole in the barrier of prejudice. Although the book is historical fiction and deals with the black-white issue, it is easily applicable to the treatment of any group today. A real pleasure to read aloud, and, it seems, a real pleasure to listen to and to borrow.[...]"
2,I only like one song of the cd.,If you want to buy his music then buy some of his whole albums from the late 70's. I wouldn't buy his greatest hits.
1,Uninformative and useless!!,"I bought this book thinking it would provide detailed information on how to start and run a fan club. I was very disappointed in it, especially for the price. The book is 99 pages with a very big font and double spaced. She spends very little time telling you how to actually secure the services of the celebrity's management and speaks very generically throughout the book. There are a few generic contracts at the end of the book but nothing really useful here. Total waste of money!!"
5,A Dream Come True!,"I've been a member of fan clubs since I can remember being interested in music (quite a long time now)and have always fantasized about running my own club. But how in the world do you start something like that? Well, I recommend this book to guide you. I was so pleased to see examples of letters, contracts and member cards!!!! This truly is a dream come true."
3,Gripping,I believe in UFO's and even think there is something to Ghosts - but the idea of Walk-ins is going to take some acceptance - but I'm getting there. Thankfully over 90% of the predictions for the last twenty years have not yet happened. What this book really needs is substantiative evidence with reasoned support for the theories put forward. There is nothing to convince you to believe unless you want to. As fact/fiction it is gripping - well worth a read
5,Strangers Among us,Very well informative book. Many people is not aware that these things happened but I am certanty know that is true.
5,"If you liked Aliens Amoung Us, you will like this book too.",I have read all Ruth's books. All more than once. She keeps it interesting from the first page to the last. After reading her books you keep searching everywhere for more information.
4,Don't miss the Penn-Dutch series!,"Beware of reading Tamar Myer's latest offering from the Penn-Dutch mystery series, ""Just Plain Pickled to Death,"" in public places. Passers-bye will eye you with suspicion as you snicker, giggle, chortle, and even guffaw your way through the adventures of Magdalena Yoder as she ensures that nothing, not even a 20-year-old murder, will prevent her from marrying her beloved Pooky Bear, the handsome Aaron Miller. Supported by a cast of irrepressibly loony allies and antagonists, Magdalena is bound to be the funniest (and most determined!) sleuth you've ever had the pleasure to read.Chris Jacobs"
4,Thank Goodness. This Book is Hilarious!,"I was so disappointed after the last book, but this book made up for it in spades. It is extremely funny, and the final bit at the end of the book with Magdalena's wedding will make you howl. Even the discovery of the corpse is funny. It turns up in a 20-year old bucket of sauerkraut. Magdalena is less than amused since the sauerkraut was given to her by her soon to be father-in-law as a gift. Now with the discovery of this corpse, will she still be able to get married in a week? You'll have to read to find out what hilarious antics she gets up to this time."
4,An unusual wedding story,"Magdalena Yoder, 44-year-old proprietess of the PennDutch Inn is about to be married. Her future father-in-law sends her a large barrel of sauerkraut as a wedding gift, but unfortunately it contains the remains of Aaron (the groom's) cousin who has been missing for 20 years! This becomes more than a minor inconvenience when the perpretrator appears to be someone in Aaron's family. Magdalena is racing against time as she attempts to solve the mystery, bury the deceased, and jail the murderer before the wedding date. As usual, she gets too close to the truth and the murderer wants to silence her before she makes his identity known. Myers has a clever sense of humor and this is evidenced in some of the hilarious scenes from this book. Read this one when you're in the mood for a good laugh!"
4,"fascinating, useless, riveting...","They said it, do we believe it? Who cares! This book is for the die-hard Kurtney fan who wants to read every crazy morsel that ever dripped from their lips. The photos are great, there is an especially appalling photo of Courtney that is not to be missed...I personally can't get enough of either one of these punk rock cartoon characters and this book is a keeper!"
2,coffee-table book,Disappointing. It's the kind of book that was published about some guy who was smashed in a train wreck the day after it happened accompanied by a whole lot of pictures of the guy while he was alive and some liner notes and that's about it. No insight to be derived from here.
2,There are better books on Kurt Cobain,This book takes many quotes while Nirvana was still a viable band and latter comments by Courtney. I perfer to read the entire interview rather than quotes out of context. I don't know about you but I'm not too interested in what Courtney's perspective is. I liked her in the Larry Flint movie by Oliver Stone but I always felt she saw Cobain as a rising star and hooked her wagon on to him.
1,Poorly constucted,Poorly constructed and varnished I returned product. I couldn't even get the screws off to open it. I found it frustrating
5,Polish rock!,"Mafia was the Polish band existing since about 1990. The lead singer Andrzej ""Piasek"" (which means ""Sand"") Piaseczny went on with a solo career in about 1998 along with the contribution in the band.""Gabinety"" is their first album. It contains 12 songs, which includes 2 in English. Even though you can hear the accent in them, they're still good.""Gabinety"" (""Offices"" in translation) show that Polish groups can also play good rock too. Too bad that the band dropped their style to switch to 'Backstreet Boys' kind of music on their next albums: ""FM"", and ""99""."
5,I Don't Want to Shoot an Elephant,A great book full of wonderful stories. A must read for any lover of the outdoors. Although some of the stories were written 40-50 years ago they are just as readable and meaningfull today as then. Some will bring tears to your eyes while others will have you rolling on the floor in laughter. Babcock is a great writer!
1,Read it for class,"just throwing it out there, this book isn't for everyone. It was kinda boring, and it is riddled with unimportant plot info. It calls itself a fable, but I would say it does not meet the criteria for that. Honestly, unless you are some sort of super feminist or just like boring books I wouldn't recommend it. I would like to solidify that this review is written by a college student, as well as a guy, this is totally my personal opinion, and you all have the right to ignore it. just do not pick this thing up and expect real fantasy, its very plain, and grounded. nothing fantasy like about it apart from the magical dead women writers the protagonist sees on her travels. They even manage to make that a boring point to the book as well."
2,Lasted one year,"I purchased this item for the passenger front door. It lasted about a year before the motor failed. There were no problems on the install, so I have to give it 2 stars. If you plan on keeping the car this part goes in, buy local so you can get a limited lifetime warranty."
2,"Works, fits well, but window controller is backwards","The part was a steal for the money - more than half off auto retailers in my area. The part came in a timely manner and fit into the door just fine. However, the window controller was backwards."
2,You get what you pay for,"This is the second window regulator that I have purchased but only because of the price. The first regulator I bought was extremely loud and slow. I have yet to figure out why. Even the mech that put it in was sceptical. The second regulator was broken before it even came out of the box. Luckily, the mech was able to weld it back together. Like the title says, you get what you pay for. All I can really say is that the product works."
4,This is a good one,"Got this DVD for Christmas. Pretty enjoyable all the way through. I expected the live clips to be about 50/50 Blackmore and Morse. Instead it's more like 99% Morse. That's cool though. This is Gillan's project and he can do whatever he wants. Greatest hard rock vocalist ever, by the way..."
3,These are the PARROT ones not for macaw,"The photo in the description is misleading and shows the bird eating from the blue tub for the macaws. However, the pellets you are ordering from this listing is the green tub (as the description says) which is for birds a bit smaller than macaws. Please don't be in a hurry and know what you are purchasing so you don't make the same mistake I almost made! The photo is a bit misleading."
4,Great band,"While this guys are a little to crazy for me, theres no denying that they are without a doubt one of the most, if not the most talented latin Rock band out there.While I consider myself a huge Mana fan , and I also like Jaguares and La Ley... when it comes down to it, Fobia may be most talented of them all. The only thing that stops me from calling fobia the best latin band ive ever heard is the fact that I cant get into their old stuff. I LOVE their music from the mid 90s (mostly whats on the ""Amor chiquito"" album), but i cant get into the older stuff... while i like every single Mana album there is.So if i had to rank the bands , i would rank Mana # 1, Fobia # 2, and La ley has an edge on Jaguares for # 3.Still, I saw fobia performing at the mexican show called ""Otro rollo"" and the chimestry seems to be gone. I hope im wrong.Fobia's drummer is just insane... hes really good. Not quite Alex Gonzalex from Mana (that guy is amazing), but he is really really good too."
4,All I Wanna Do - Dannii Minogue,"Australian CD Maxi Single Track Listing for -""ALL I WANNA DO"" - DANNII MINOGUE1) Radio Version - 4:302) 12"" Extended Mix - 6:513) Trouser Enthusiasts Toys Of Desperation Mix - 11:044) Xenomania Dream House Mix - 5:535) D-Bop's Innocent Girl Mix - 7:281997"
2,Comprendido Time Flop,"Of the dozen or so albums Deutsch Nepal has put out, this is by far the most yawn-worthy and uninspired. If they were trying to do something intelligent with this album, it must have involved giving the listener a dull headache, and you don't need this album for that (you can punch yourself in the face as many times as you want completely for free). Deutsch Nepal is capable of good music, and for their best work I would suggest tracking down a copy of ""Deflagration of Hell"" (available as a 2003 reissue), ""Tolerance"", or the limited edition ""Only Silence Among the Filthy,"" in that order. Even then, though, I probably would still only recommend investing the effort of such a quest to the most die-hard of rythmic and industrial noise fans."
2,"Good, if you're in high school","This book is too elementary for advanced students (upper undergraduate, graduate or above), * even non-math majors *, and even if you have never taken a course on math proofs or logic. You won't find much in this book that you haven't already gotten from other sources or learned ""the hard way"".However, at the high school or lower undergraduate level, or for an extremely non-mathematically oriented person, I recommend it since it contains information that you're not likely to find in other books at that level, not only about proofs but also basic logic.As for the ""Demystified Series"", I have another book that is great. This one was a disappointment."
1,Another Disappointmentt from this author,I was about 25% through the book and decided that it wasn't worth finishing.Then I discovered the author was Stan Gibilisco. I have had the misfortunate to have purchased two other books of his that were worse than this one. I will have to start checking to see who the author is in the future instead of just buying because the title looks interesting.I don't understand why the publisher keeps publishing Gibilisco writings.
4,Great details of a charlatan an a par with Madoff,"This is one of the few books that I have read twice. I had reada bit of Dr Brinkley before, but this gave an insight to a personwho could have been great - instead of infamous.I'm trying to figure out who could play Brinkley in the sure to bemade Brinkley movie: After watching the Academy Awards: Christoph Waltz!"
1,Songs on CD don't match tracklisting on insert!,"The disc title seems to match the CD insert, but none of the tracks match the track titles listed on the back insert. Therefore, the one track I bought the CD to obtain I did not in fact get. When the CD is inserted into iTunes, the tracks are totally wrong, and I have all the proper liturgical books (Liber Brevior and Liber Usualis) to verify the music and lyrics of the tracks. However, if you're just looking for another random Gregorian chant disc, you should be satisfied."
2,Junk.,"Bought a case of these. Unless you're driving small screws, stay away. These constantly wear down on me and I find myself replacing them every 5 minutes at times. Seems like the screw head is just as hard as the bit... something's not right about that."
1,Must have gotten a bad batch,"I purchased these bit tips from The Home Depot a week ago. To be fair, I was using the bits to drive 3"" deck screws to fasten studs (pre-drilled holes) rather than to drive shorter screws through drywall into studs, but I was still surprised by how malleable (soft) the metal is in these bits. Each bit was shot (sharp edges within phillips cross became rounded off) after driving only five or six screws, resulting in a great deal of stripped screw heads. One bit actually fractured (tip broke off) driving a screw into soft pine.Perhaps I got a bad batch, but I was truly surprised to find how soft the metal is in these bits. The DeWALT website says this item has been discontinued; perhaps durability was the issue."
4,Sasha needs to put a full-length out,"If this is any indication of what Sasha can do without his turntables... he should spend more time in the studio and less DJing. The man can write some great stuff... trance i guess. But Sasha tends not to fall into that old boom-hiss song structure, but instead tend to put percussion into the background behind a birage of synths.... the tracks are probably by purpose overlength and build quite well... though there is a lack of real good hooks... Xpander is probably the only track with a serious attempt at hummable melody, although rabbitweed comes close. Again, i would be interested to hear a full-length."
5,Sublime,This is one of best cds I've ever bought. Three of the four songs are masterpieces. Rabbitweed is so dark and intense. Baja is so beautiful and chilled out. Xpander is the definitive song of electronica. Highly recommended for any electronica fan.
5,An excellent Piece,"I agree with a lot of people that this sets a high standard for Sasha and that it is indeed an excellent piece.The only thing that bothers me about this CD is that it's not mixed. Other than that I have no complaints.Xpander, a track on the CD is very nice and it's tempo is decently fast and up beat.Belfunk is also a nice track, starting out slow and then going into a frenzy bass and electronic synths playing throughout the song.Rabbitweed, the most interesting and probably the most complex songs on the CD, meant something for raves and such, I really like this song.Baja, the last track and a nice ender for the CD, soft and mellow, sorta a cool down I suppose. Kinda dreamy and with some bass here and there.All and all this is an important CD to own if you like Sasha's work or if not it might be a nice starter into the world of trance."
4,what I think.....,"First off again I'm not writing a book here to quantify my authority upon the subject of electronica...I read the reviews ""f-ing"" christ just shut your pie hole and listen to the CD already...what? you think your Mozart's wet dream or something ??...Benjamin T. Young ""Skillz McGavern"" --you are a blowhard...christ I read your other reviews...( yawning ) boring...thanks but no thanks music is music..other people want insightful reviews not your goddamned thesis paper on it...onward and upward...sorry I had to go off like that..The CD is excellent, I cut my teeth with electrica with this CD...I recommend it..get the full version..."
4,Good for the price,I used this on some canadian lakes last week. Trolled at an average of 70 feet and all seemed fine. It certainly brought fish in the boat better than the 3 way swivel. There is a bit of vibration noise traveling through the unit when trolling faster and that is why I gave it 4 stars.
4,"Incompatability of ""Sanburg's Lincoln""","I was impressed with the quality of this package, altho the films from which the transfers were made are slightly pink, from age. There are only two problems with it: The discs will not play on my new bluray machine. These are the only non-bluray DVD's I have bought that won't play on it. I only get the menu, but when I click to play any episodes, there is no response. SO I had to watch it elsewhere, on a regular DVD player. The other problem is more of a puzzlement; these episodes are not in chronological order, as originally aired! They are not in sequence with Lincoln's life. There must have been a reason for doing this, but it is beyond me."
3,Horrible transfer,"I bought this DVD based on the meager four reviews posted on Amazon and was disappointed when I received it, put it in my DVD player and began to watch it. The video quality is extremely poor. I have VHS tapes with a better picture than you get with this and, considering it was just released this year, I'm appalled at the treatment. Why even bother to put this out with the picture quality as it is? Oh, I'll still watch it because I love Holbrook's characterization of Lincoln but throughout I'll be lamenting the quality (or lack thereof)of the picture."
4,Great series,"This was made for TV in the early 70s and remains one of the great programs about Lincoln. Holbrook plays him as a shrewd country lawyer, without the usual Christ-like aspects, which were common in the early film versions. The series is limited by budget and does not show the true scope of the war. Holbrook and Sada Tompson are magnificent, although Lincoln’s makeup is sometimes rather obvious. Holbrook also used the voice that was described in the historys, not the rich baritone that is usually part of the role.We see the shrewd politician and leader and come to respect the intellect of the man. We also see the skills that allowed him to hold together a cabinet of enemies. The resolution could be a lot better and remastering would be a great help but considering the age, it is not unreasonable. The supporting cast is excellent. A must for history teachers."
2,Problem with the performance of the dvd not with the content of the production.,"What I was able to watch was OK. After seeing Spielberg's production, Lincoln,all other productions pale in Spileberg's work of art. My main criticism isn't with the production; it's with the dvd itself. I can only get the third part to the production to play. The rest of the dvd doesn't play. Thank you for your qustions. Betty Grace McCollum"
1,A Better Idea,"Gore Vidal's Lincoln with Sam Waterson is better IMO. It is a superior production, more accurate insight, better casting.Mary Todd Lincoln was certifiable insane and this is shown better in Vidal's production. Also there are virtually no battle scenes in the Sandburg production.Sandburg's Lincoln"
4,Good USMLE review book,"This book is not sufficient for course study, but is a very good choice for Step 1 preparation. Anatomy is a fairly low yield topic on the Step 1 exam and this is a good, concise review of clinically relevant anatomy."
2,It won't be staying on my shelf.,"At first I thought this book was going to be excellent. 4 chapters into the book and I was singing the praises to anyone who would listen. By the time I ended the story I was disappointed and felt a touch cheated. I enjoyed Berlinski's story about getting into the CIA and living in Northern VA, I know the places etc, she talks about, but she never made me feel for the characters. I skimmed the last three chapters with frustration while thinking 'who cares, I just want it to end.' If you have a lot of free time and are looking for a rather unremarkable read, then this is the book for you. This book is not a procedural novel as you may think in the beginning."
3,Ever wanted to join the CIA?,"This is a story about Selena Keller, who on a whim, decides to send her résumé to the CIA. What follows is a battery of tests and then finally training, to become a spy. I'm not sure how much of the book is actually based on fact, but I found all Serena's training to be incredibly interesting. Besides being trained, we see Selena fall in love with Stan, another spy in training, or is he? About 75% of the book focused on Selena's job and the other 25% was on her personal life, so I found it harder to get attached to the characters. Her boyfriend, Stan, seemed like a particularly strange guy for her, but maybe it's because Selena's character wasn't explored so much, so I didn't feel like I really knew her. All in all, an entertaining read for anyone who has ever dreamt of being a spy, or has seen ""The Recruit""."
2,Starts out great...then fades fast,"Like an earlier reviewer, I was also completely hooked for the first 4 chapters, but then it seemed like the story ran out of steam. The Selena that ended the book was not the same woman who started it - she seemed to be making some pretty uncharacteristic errors for someone who had just completed training to be a spy."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!,"I bought the book on tape. There was no story, no plot, and no real ending! It was all about lies, mistrust, and backstabing. It made the CIA look really bad. Don't waste your money!"
2,just for addicts!,"Not the best of Sherlock Holmes films, neither The Deadly Necklace nor The Speckled Band. The last being new to me, was still interesting, but..."
2,Sherlock Holmes Double Feature,The ratings I assign to a movie are based on environment. Another person might have a different opinion. Thats why there is freedom of choice.
2,Not User Friendly,"I bought this assuming I'd be getting a DVD of lots of video clips I could use in making little videos. However, I just watched it and I was VERY disappointed. All the video clips, ""85"" so they say, are combined into 3 VOB files -- very unhandy! There's not even any chapters which could make it at least a LITTLE easier to try and navigate through. In order to snag an individual clip, you have to play through the entire video, stop where the clip you want is, use OTHER hardware/software to re-record each little clip you want, convert it into a different video file format (MP4, AVI, WMV, etc.), and then individually save them. On top of that, the quality is not really DVD but more like VHS.Good news is that, if you're a fan of the Lake Tahoe area, it is spectacular footage, but as I said....NOT user friendly!!! I don't recommend buying this at all, unless you own a small movie studio..."
3,Probably good,"This item is probably good, but I did not get the chance to try it. I used Amazon's fitment guide to get the correct part for my truck but when I received it I found it was way too big. Fortunately, Amazon has a hassle free return policy so it turned out OK. Gates belts are supposed to be very good. Just be sure to get the correct one for your vehicle."
4,A Refreshing Look at the Whole of Australian Advocacy,"The title is somewhat misleading. Glissan covers the entire field of trial advocacy, as can be seen from the table of contents:1. Etiquette2. General Techniques of Advocacy3. Opening the Case4. Examination-in-Chief5. Cross-Examination6. Re-Examination7. Address -- the Final Speech8. The Ethics of Advocacy9. Notable Cross-ExaminationsAs the public defender for New South Wales, Glissan comes from a cadre of lawyers who place service above self. Career public advocates, both prosecution and defense, will never get rich. They will, however, help their fellow man and gain a wealth of trial experience.Glissan writes with good humor and good knowledge, and his presentation is both entertaining and educational. Australian trial practice differs somewhat from the USA, and some of Glissan's comments might not be pertinent to American trial practice. If the reader keeps that caveat in mind, the book can be very helpful."
5,Love it!,"I use this with my 32"" LCD HDTV to switch between my 2nd cable box (hooked up to my DVD-RW/VCR, a second VCR and my DVD Player.This switch box is amazing! And the remote control feature is great!I use my Phillips 8-device learning remote to operate it. I just pointed my original remote at the Phillips universal learning remote and programmed it in 2 minutes flat.It is really great to just kick back and use the remote control to switch between my composite devices.Great audio and video with no drop out or artifacts either.I highly recommend this for anyone."
2,Poor remote reception,"I purchased this audio switch in January 2011. I am now shopping for another audio switch to replace it, because its remote signal reception (from both the included remote and from my Harmony 550 remote) is very poor -- an irritant every time I use my Harmony remote to turn on or off my home theater components. I am considering replacing it with the Nyrius SW200 audio selector (Nyrius SW200 S-Video Composite & Digital Optical Toslink 3 Input Audio Video Selector Switch with Remote Compatible with DVD player, Satellite, Cable, PCM, Dolby Digital, DTS, XBOX360, PS3, Wii, iPod), and if anyone has opinions about that item versus this one, I'd be interested to read them. I gave this item 2 stars because Amazon's rating system says 3 stars means ""It's OK,"" and if that were the case I guess I wouldn't be shopping to replace it!"
5,Way to go!,This product solved my problem of not having enough inputs to go around. It simplified my problem by adding 3 imputs--just what I needed. I hereby recommend this Toslink product.Thomas L. Line
4,works as advertised,"Works great to split toslink to my sound bar. Works with logitech universal remote. Handy interface with individual buttons for each input. don't bother with some lame manual switch, spend the couple extra dollars and integrate your system"
4,Good product,"i;ve tested it with a seperate 2 connections, an dit is working fine, I'm an electrical engineer, and I like it, however, there are other products to with the same funtions."
4,Great SPDIF switch,"I am only using the SPDIF (optical audio) inputs and outputs, but they are working great with my Logitech remote. I needed more optical inputs for my Onkyo receiver and this switch does the trick.Only complaint was that the protective plug on one of the optical inputs was defective and broke off during removal. Had to carefully drill it out with a Dremel tool to remove it."
3,Buyer beware,"I bought this with the sole purpose of intending to hook up multiple optical audio devices to one optical input. I assume the device works flawlessly, only I never got to use it; the optical inputs on the back of the box are the standard, almost pentagonal shape. The output however is a square. I looked around at numerous websites and tried the local Radio Shack (lol) but could not find a square-shaped TOS link cable to save my life. I couldn't find anything regarding this anywhere, so, just a heads up to perspective buyers."
5,Great Optical Audio Switch.,"Like other reviewers I only needed this for the optical inputs. I have my DVR, Xbox 360 and PS3 all connected to this switch with optical audio cables. Then the output runs to my turtle beach X4 wireless headphones that has an optical out that then runs to my surround sound. I like to be able to switch between devices with the ability to use the surround sound or headphones or even both at the same time. The remote is a litle credit card style that I taped ghetto faboulous style to my surround sound remote until I get a universal."
2,Psych-K - An Infomercial,"The Missing Peace in Your Life! By Robert M. Williams, M.A. is a fast, easy read. It is inspirational and motivational, complete with success stories. It appears to be well researched and is well documented. It explains muscle testing and its use to determine negative beliefs through a process called Psych-K. It intimates that the use of Psych-K can bring about positive changes for everyone by changing negative beliefs. It isn't until almost the end of the book that you realize the book will not provide you with tools for using the process to implement change. The book turns out to be a highly readable infomercial for the author's Psych-K workshops. And like all infomercials, the last chapter which provides the tools for actually implementing change requires the output of significant money and time. An interesting read, but definitely not worth the cost."
1,Waste of money,"Psych-K is a $22 rip-off! The print and spacing in this 150 page paperback are so large, the entire text could have been done as a pamphlet. :-("
1,Worthless,"This book promises to reveal the secret of real change, but after reading the book, the last chapter tells that the secret to change is to sign up for a seminar. The book is just an advertisement for costly seminars."
4,Sub-conscious communication for Dummies,"I read this book in almost one sitting and have since attended the intro Psych-K seminar. I consider the information introduced here to be potentially life changing. The techniques Rob has developed to establish communication between the conscious and sub-conscious self, only introduced in the book, are sophisticated, simple and appear to be very powerful. Time will tell. If you're on the path of self-discovery, this might be a great tool."
4,Good book!,"An easy to understand and easy to read book about this method, which i currently have no experince from - but you get a good picture of the theory behind the process in this book - and i can highly recommend it to anyone interested in energy psychology and the new techniques of spirituality/psychology!"
1,Returned this book....,This book is definitely not what I expected. It is a commercial for the PSYCH-K trainings. Not much information and no suggestions about how to use PSYCH-K.I went to the reviews to see if I had missed something and was the only one disappointed. I am not alone.Returned it!
3,Good overview but lacks details,"Good overview of the process but would like a little more detail especially about how to everse the negative programming in the subconscious mind. The book alludes to a ""wholebrain"" process to do this but gives no details about the process - how it works and specifically what it is."
4,Psyched,I love the idea and it was a quick easy read. Not the best book but it certainly got my attention though. It's good if your interested in this subject but don't expect any answers it leaves you hanging. I wish he would not have left the ending with the intent of people buying into his seminar. I would have went to the seminar if I had the option and some kind of answer at the end of this book. I do not like being forced into anything...... to bad it could have been fantastic.
2,PSYCH-K,THIS BOOK IS VERY INFORMATIVE HOWEVER IN MY OPINION IT IS A SUPER ADVERTISEMENT AND COMMERCIAL FOR THE AUTHORS OWN WORK AS A THERAPIST. IT TEASES AND FINALLY LETS ONE DOWN. YOU HAVE TO JOIN OR GO TO A THERAPIST OF THIS WORK. ABIG LET DOWN FOR ME AS OTHER BOOKS THAT THE AUTHOR SHARES WITH DR BRUCE LIPTON ARE A COMPLETE WORK AND VERY HELPFUL AND INFORMATIVE. THANK YOU DR.GEOFF FREED
5,"The book is a companion to the PSYCH-K experiential workshops...""","I took a few PSYCH-K sessions and then read this book to find out more. My life was profoundly changed for the positive. PSYCH-K stands out as far and away THE most effective method I have used for personal change. I dont understand the negative reviews because in the opening description of this book review it states: ""The book is a companion to the PSYCH-K experiential workshops where participants learn specific techniques for changing self-limiting beliefs. The book provides the foundational philosophy and science behind this revolutionary process""."
3,Good information but.....,"I really enjoyed the book and was enthusiastic about doing the basic and advanced courses but unfortunately, unless you live in the USA or Canada where they hold the majority of the courses, you don't have the option of attending them (unless you are prepared to pay for all the travel expenses to get there). What a pity."
3,David Hawkins and muscle testing,"I haven't read the book, but saw a 1 hour video where Rob Williams demonstrated the basics of 'his' PSYCH-K technique. He never mentioned the fact that Dr. David Hawkins also uses this technique - invented it, perhaps - as discribed in his book Power vs. Force: The Hidden Determinants of Human Behavior.I wonder who's the copycat here..."
5,Clarifying an approach to positive change.,This book is a great presentation of the potential we all have to make lasting positive changes. The book does not provide the method for changing but clarifies what is necessary and what is not necessary for making changes in the subconscious portion of the mind - the part that determines the quality of nearly every aspect of life. It is a leader for the Basic Workshop where the tools are presented and practiced. There is too much information to learn the process of PSYCH-K sufficiently from a book or DVD and is best learned by working with certified/qualified instructors for guidance and direction in a workshop environment. See the website for more details and an instructor list for making inquiries: www.psych-k.com.
5,Good book with a great process,"I have studied and applied hundreds of methods of implementing personal growth over my 70 years, and I practice hypnosis, EFT, NLP, etc., every day. I find Psych-K to be a very fast way to cause deep and lasting change."
4,Southeast Asia to Near/Middle East,"Naive by today's standards but nevertheless a poignant read in the context of the April 2003 American/UK/Iraq conflict. While Eisenhower is said to have been profoundly taken with this book thus effecting changes in policy abroad, in all the years since 1958, continued U.S. geopolitical tamperings and arrogance have resulted in the loss of millions of lives."
4,From communists to terrorists,"The book used to have weight but it seems now a mere timely insight in reference to fighting terrorists. Even though Vietnam became a lost cause, it was surely noble and has taught us how NOT to fight future wars. Thankfully the Americans had been fighting communism all those years. (Who knows how many Pol-Pots there may have been were there no resistance?). It surely seems foolhardy now to think that communist expandsionism was harmless now that we know how many people died at the hands of their own communist regimes(and still do). Same goes for the war on terror. The ugly American now, as was then, is our only hope."
5,Two Thumbs way up!,"This book here is required reading for all United States Marines serving in diplomatic assignments overseas and I must say it was fantastic. Personally I do not consider myself a reader but the first chapter just sucks you in. I read the book in two days which is fast for me, so that's saying a lot. It paints a beautiful picture of all the things that are wrong with the American foreign service and by the time you are finish reading it you begin to analyze yourself to ensure you are not or do not become the ""Ugly American."""
4,"A must read for global business, international travelers, and diplomats",A must read for those who wish to excel in globally oriented businesses. I would also recommend this book for those who travel outside the United States for both business or pleasure. It provides a dose of humility for American culture through a series of vignettes about Americans working overseas
4,Very good story and a quick read.,This is a popular book among US military members and I was very impressed with the story and the message.
4,Enduring Lessons for American Foreign Policy,"The Ugly American is a classic book about the manner in which the U.S. approached Vietnam in the 1950s, but could just as well refer to American involvement in the Arab world today. Burdick and Lederer tell several satirical and easy-to-read stories capturing the arrogance, ignorance, and cultural insensitivity which too often mark the image of America abroad. The authors' impatient call for a reexamination of American methods continue to resonate, and their recommendations are no less virtuous today. Anyone with an interest in U.S. foreign policy, history, or the Vietnam era will find The Ugly American a delightful read."
5,Great alternative to rubber stems that break,I have a trailer that I have had problems with the tires going flat on the road due to the rubber stems breaking and a metal type loosing air when traveling. I finally got these bolt on stems and probably won't have another problem like that. So far they are keeping the air in just fine. They fit great and were not that expensive.
3,"ok, not great, quality control needs to improve","Of the four valvestems I got, one would not hold pressure. I bought a spare core and replacing the core fixed the problem. Needless to say, this should not be necessary. I could have just returned the package but I wanted to understand what the problem was.Also, for anyone buying these to use in carbonating water, it's not always easy to get the nut on tight enough. I grabbed the top of the stem with pliers and this trashed the threads for the cap. This does not hurt its value for carbonation but it feels wrong to have to do this."
3,Love Maya's kundalini yoga,"...however, if I'd known this dvd is a companion to the similarly named book by her, I wouldn't have bought it. She shows how to do the exercises from the book, but this isn't a ""workout"" or a yoga routine. Unlike the other reviewer, I like the white look, even though it is a bit on the bright side. I also like the music and the atmosphere - just wish this was a proper routine.I own all the dvds by Maya and the only thing that sometimes bugs me is that she isn't very specific with her instructions. I'd also enjoy longer routines with a bit less hasty feeling."
5,In to Lunch,"While backward-looking pea-brainers like Marsallis walk away with all the money, people like Jemeel Moondoc are making deep, beautiful contributions to the language of jazz. This is magnificent music that Mingus, Cecil Taylor, and maybe even Pierre Boulez would love. The confidence these improvisors have in their vocabularies gives this music an assurance that their 1960's ancestors struggled to approach. This album particularly makes good the promises of Andrew Hill, Bobby Hutcherson, Eric Dolphy et al., without having to think of itself as out to lunch. This is music made by people for the love of it, not because they know you'll buy it, and if your ears were ever open you'll love this. All of Jemeel Moondoc's records are different from each other. Fire in the Valley is as beautiful as this and not at all the same. I'd review that one too, but it isn't available on amazon. Buy this! Let real musicians know some people listen and know the difference."
4,Sounds familiar,"I read Lisa Lanman's book ""Murder By Marriage"" and guess what???It reads just like the 1968 manuscript that Lisa Woessner (now Lanman) typed from the story I dictated to her between September 1968 and March 1969.The title of the 1968 novel originally was ""A Summer At Sakenett"" and then was changed to ""Scrimshaw House,"" according to the two manuscripts in my possession.I see that Lisa changed the title to ""Murder By Marriage."" Interestingly enough, that was the title of another manuscript that I dictated to her in late 1969. That, too, is in my possession.Not only does the plot of ""Murder By Marriage"" appear in the 1968 manuscripts, the names of most of the central characters are the same.It is a shame she didn't contact me before publishing the story as her original work, nor has she made any attempt to since then. It would have been nice.I wanted to set the record straight.By the way, I liked the story. It reads just like the 1968 manuscript.John E. Fitzgibbon, Jr."
3,Missing one little thing,The bits are all good quality but the set is missing a longer flat head piece. All it has are the ones for the adapter and that ended up being longer than what I needed.
4,Gift,Bought this as a gift for my dad. He loved it and keeps it in his car. I haven't heard any complaints.
2,Sound quality is garbage,"You cant get either movie on Blu-Ray so I figured I would give this double feature a shot.Picture looks great as you would expect from a Blu-Ray, but the sound was horrid. I watched a different blu-ray before and another after and they both sounded great. This double feature just didnt cut it when it came to sound."
1,19 pages length. VB for dummies,"The <book> is 19 pages length. It just guides you, step by step, how to create a VB form (how to drag the controls, telling you how to save the project, etc.) and the code to insert in the events.It does NOT show any DirectSound information reference at all, does not explain why they do what they do, and has 0 advantage of downloading the source code from somewhere and just run it.(BTW, their page is not available, and the Microsoft's link they provide no longer exists [note that the book is new]).In short: find a web site with google and get some code. For sure you'll get better information and save 10 bucks."
1,Hard to Install for Nothing New,"I have a Dell Pentium computer...nothing unusual, but installing the new Print Shop was a nightmare. I kept getting errors and it just wouldn't install. I was able to get it going on my office computer to find that it's just the same as the version I already have. The box says it now does PDF. I was just hoping it would do more cards and things I actually use.If you have version 12, you don't need to buy this. Save yourself the installation nightmare."
3,No Manual,"This is a disappointment for the high price as it has no manual. I've enjoyed previous versions of P.S. Deluxe, and this is the first that didn't include a paper manual. I don't like reading instructions on the computer screen/electronic manuals."
1,Do not buy this CD.,"I don't have this album. I haven't even heard all the songs, but I have read the lyrics, and that's enough to tell me that this album isn't worth buying. The songs I have heard were mediocre at best, this music is not challenging, its not even relaxing, its stupefying. You want lyrics with emotions and real meaning? buy a Bob Dylan album or a Nick Drake album, not this garbage."
5,Found Him At JJJ,"I found Pete on the list of top 100 songs of the year at Triple J radio station's website. They're a station in Australia and I frequently check their website for up-and-comers. I found Alex Lloyd on there as well. Both him and Pete Murray are 2 of my favorite artists. Pete's music is so touching and melodic. I hope he makes it big in the U.S. because he deserves it, but part of me wants him to remain anonymous because I don't want him to change."
5,Amazing :),"I can't stop listening to this album. Murray's voice is the centerpiece of this whole work. Smooth and honey-like, but with tons of authority. This is a CD you will leave in your player for WEEKS. I know I will.Favorite tracks are 1,2,3, and 8."
4,Talent to Burn,Buy it now and lock it in. So Beautiful is the song of the year. The rest is 4 * class. The future is over-popularity and the risks of over-production. Buy it now before they throw in the drum machines and complicated arrangements. Straight from the soul but way too marketable.
1,Save Your Money,This is advertised as a Paperback book. A better description would be a photocopied pamphlet. It is very poor quality with about 3rd generation photocopies of photographs which are so dark in most cases as to show no detail. The information is very general and can be found on almost any website.Don't waste your money on this one!
1,Fourty Bucks?,This is a slightly animated stuffed animal. It's animated antics are few and after a few times become annoying. It won't stop gurgling. It has been sitting on my daughter's shelf gathering dust.
2,Arrived broken!,"Well, I bought this toy as an ""extra"" gift to have on hand for when my daughter went to birthday parties, etc. and when I finally needed it, it was broken! It is past the available return date, so now I am stuck with a broken Fuzz Luvz that only moves it's eyes. [...]. My daughter also has one, which was fun for awhile, but now collects dust as well."
1,Do not waste your money,"Purchased this in October for a Christmas gift for daughter. The reviews and item description sounded really cute. My daughter, age 8, opened it and was bored within minutes. It makes a few sounds and movements like the Furby dolls of the 80's. The back of the box actually shows this thing dancing and when you open the package you see the legs are fused together. It is worth a few dollars at most. I repackaged to return and found out I was too late to return, since it was purchased in October. I am happy to say this was the only gift she was dissappointed with."
4,Lighthearted and Fun,"Though not nearly as terrific as his KINDERGARTEN book, Uh-Oh is a great read. Fullugham has some unique perspectives. This is a terrific book that can be savored a few pages at a time. The included essays are often funny, sometimes touching, and always enjoyable. The way the authour looks at the commonplace, and then bestows it with a sense of wonder has brought me back to Mr. Fullgham's books on a number of occassions. Read one and you'll be hooked."
3,We should all look at life this way!!!,"I've recently read Fulghum's ""All I need to know..."", ""It was on fire..."" and ""Uh-Oh..."". Admittedly the go down hill from the first one, they are a great set of books, first, second, and third, on the way we ""should"" look at life, instead of taking ourselves and unimportant things in life so seriously. Much of Fulghum's points of view are as though they are glimpses of the world through the eyes of a child, yet written with the wisdom of an old man. Wonderful easy reading."
1,Horrid,"The author wastes our time describing how he is living it up off the profits from his worthless books. If this sounds interesting to you then you're in luck. Some real gems in this one, including the thought provoking question of what kind of pants humans would have to wear if they had rears that lit up like a firefly. No joke."
4,The new building better English,"Copyrights 1961, 1958, 1944. Row, Peterson and company. Authors are Harry Green, Kate Loomis....Englsh grammar as a basic-skills subject. The book is about four large areas of communication- speaking, listening, reading and writing."
2,Monument to Self not Scholarship,Hahneman is a first rate modernist scholar who proposes history is what he makes it and truth is that forged on his anvil. The volume is a treasure of widespread research. However the author is weak on truth and demonstrates that in trying to recusitate a still-born idea from the 1970's and mold it into acceptance in today's world of lessoning standards of scholarship.Many will stand up and cheer if they hold his weak ideas of truth or when gagging on his multitudinous research and pedantic language they mindlessly adopt his conclusions.A careful modernist scholar will note his fallacious assumptions and oversight of certain facts (as noted by Dr. E. Ferguson) and reject the volumes' implicit claim to be a monument of scholarship. Quality scholars may sympathize but must reject the conclusion for its failures to prove its case.
1,Returned!,"I bought this for my 1 quart Nalgene water bottle but it was way too small! It fell right through the top! I returned it and instead bought a ""Guyot Designs SplashGuard-Universal"" which works perfectly!"
2,Better than nothing.,"This is a decent sipper. It fits nicely, sits a litter bit lower than preferred. I have two Nalgene 32 oz. Wide Mouth bottles, one with this sipper and one with the Guyot Designs SplashGuard. I have found that this Nalgene sipper tends to splash significantly more than the Guyot designs one. It works if you're driving, or if you actually stop moving and drink from it, but if you are still moving it is nearly hopeless. The Guyot designs splashguard can be sipped from even while jogging without spilling."
1,There are better alternatives,I really don't understand why anyone would buy an Easy Sipper over a SplashGuard. Nalgene Custom Splashguard
2,wrong size,"I was mistaken and thought that this fit any wide mouth nalgene, it didnt fit on my 16 oz. The package says its made for a 32 oz. Nalgene. Maybe I missed this detail, but was diappointed that it dint fit :-("
2,ARGH!,I purchased one of these at Sports Authority. They just happened to have one prior to me thinking about buying it online @ Amazon. I didn't like it. I like the concept. The water didn't flow out easily from the sipper opening as I expected. (One can't pour water out from this hole either.)Save your money. Buy a GUYOT SPLASHGUARD instead.
4,Better than nothing,"Less spills and drips overall, but sometimes the water sits on top of the sipper and then it can still drip on you."
3,If you want plain pink dress-up slippers,"The Aurora decoration fell off of both slippers within minutes of my daughter putting them on. They have adhesive on the back like stickers and it appears a glue gun was also used to put them on the lace of the slippers. I put them back on for my daughter and they fell off within seconds that time. She was in tears about Aurora not staying on, so I stitched them to the slippers. It looks quite horrible in my opinion to have thread going through the plastic, but the Aurora now stays put and my child seems pleased. If you want Aurora dress-up slippers I'd suggest trying something different, because these will be plain pink with lace and glue in no time."
1,Do not buy these for a baby!,"I purchased these shoes because they said there were ""one size"" so I figured that they would come really small and stretch out to the child's foot but no, they are gigantic. I needed them for a 1 year old and she won't be able to wear them until she is probably 5 years old."
2,Boring ambient soundscapes,"Mick's releases under the Lull name and some of his collaborations with other artists have always alienated me. I'm a to-die-for fan of his exceptional drumming, no matter if he's in a band called Napalm Death or Scorn, or works alone. But this is a really boring effort, and I think there are dozens of more enjoyable ambient albums than this one. Stay away from Lull and get some of the Scorn stuff instead (see my reviews there)!"
1,Broke after 5 minutes...'nuf said,"I got this thinking it'll make driving screws easier. I thought that the ""sleeve"" would hold the screw while installing to make driving a breeze. Well, the sleeve part is ok, but the attachment point of the screw head to the main shaft sheared off after just several screw-driving. It happened to both of the pieces. What a piece of garbage. DeWalt should be ashamed to put their name on this product."
3,"Works OK, but doesn't last.","These screw guides DO work. They will hold your screws so you can hold on to a ladder with your other hand. My problem is with the longevity of the product. Under constant use in a construction environment they only last a couple of days before falling apart and/ or getting stuck. The little spring clips that hold them together come dislodged and the friction on the tubes wears the device out very quickly.They are far too expensive for a tool that lasts only few days on the job. If they were only a couple of dollars I could see it but...Dewalt seems to be marketing their products as ""Contractor Grade"" but I would expect a professional grade product to last a few months at least!!On the other hand I haven't found any other brand to make a significantly better product so, if you need these you may just have to pony up."
5,Driver Guide,"This is very practical and highly recommended handyman's tool accessory. A quality well built product, good price and shipped quickly."
2,Not very good for a DEWALT product,Have not had much success in using any of the pieces in this set. I do not think the problem is my DeWalt drill and driver. Maybe it is me. These are just not too user friendly in my opinion
4,My first Tools,"I knew I needed tools so I purchased something that I had saw my grandfather use and something that I felt was dependable. The shipping was speedy as always. Everything was where it was supposed to be. I don't know how anything works yet, but I'm going to learn. Just hoping that I don't ""break"" anything.4/23/2012- Good thing I bought these because they came in handy when I put up my curtains on four kitchen windows. Everything fits where its supposed to and doesn't fall out and isn't hard to extract when you need your looking for the right size. Plus there is room for more although I don't know what extra I could put in there."
3,Not enough assortment,There are (6) #2 Phillips bit tips and (3) #2 Square recess bit tips in addition to #2 Phillips power bit and #2 Square recess power bit. I personally would not need that many Phillips bits nor Square recess bits. Would like to see Torx 15 and some Allen bits.
4,"Decent selection, decent price.","There's really not much to say about screw driving bits, they chuck into the screw gun, and they either do what they're supposed to, or they break. These do what they're supposed to. The case is a bit large for what you're getting inside, but I suppose that makes it easy to find."
5,Quality product,Bought it on impulse. Turned out to be a great purchase. Life used to be simple when a screw was a Phillips or slotted. Now you need a set. Ended up building a garage over the summer and used the heck out of the set. Hard to beat the Dewalt quality and convenience of having the storage kit
5,Enough,Meets expectations. Container is solid and bits do not fall out once inserted. Small enough to fit inside any toolbox.
3,"Real pretty, not very comfortable","Very pretty on your feet.Stiff sole and leather upper, not too comfortable but not terrible either.Like the ease of sliding in and out in the summer."
4,Good Mystery,"I really appreciate forensic mysteries and Aaron Elkins has developed Gideon Oliver in a believable manner. I will admit that the forensic part of this mystery is pretty minimal, so if that is what you're after you might want to start with Gideon Oliver in ICY CLUTCHES. All in all, Dead Men's Hearts is an enjoyable, light mystery."
1,Is there a way to rate this ZERO stars?,"You like Lawrence Welk? You like insipid music? If you can listen to more than one minute of this drivel, then you're made for each other!BLEAAHHCC!"
4,Timeless reading,"It appears that Alan Lakein's esoteric look at time has not withstood the sands of time. Only a few copies remain but by their asking prices indicate time has not eroded their value. My copy has withstood the odd chews from a puppy (who they say has no sense of time). Alan collected in 150 pages an odd collection of text and images that still enchant, entertain and challenge how we perceive and use time. The use of many images and icons from the last century do not diminish the timeliness of Dr. Lakein's commentary. My review is done. As Dr. Lakein would say ""What is the best use of your time right now""?"
5,Good Product + Low Price,"Very good product for the price, it really works for a fuji s5100. Fast delivery. Merchandise as advertised."
1,Review on Des Hammil's Power Tune advices,"At first the books starts falling apart when looked in for the first time. The glue does not hold the pages together. Second, the quality of the ""tips"" Mr. Hammill provides us with is below average. The information provide[d to] the potential buyer is unadequate, when compared with the contents of the book. Example: there is no real tune-up info regarding some essential items like tuning carburettors and exhaust pipes.Advice: a waist of money and time. A definite NO-GO!"
5,"Brilliant, Insightful Book","This is a wonderful, wonderful book. Very few books truly capture the spirit of legitimate independent film, and just how much goes into it. I'm pleased to say that this book brings all this, and a whole hell of a lot of humor, too.An essential for any filmmaker looking to break through."
2,Not so Great!,"I bought this book hoping to have a fun read about making movies and this persons experience. Sadly, what I got was a book load of expletives and degrading ideas of what to throw into a scene them film it. I take away three stars for the no effort put in to not writing a fun book that many can read. I understand the shock value of the title, fine, but curses in every paragraph? I'm not saying to write like a bored, stiff, old tenured expert... But the name calling and mud slinging is not necessary (atleast not all of it). I give it two stars for the street level info. all independents need to know before making a film. Please do protect yourselves."
2,Good but the vulgarity is overkill!,"This book has great advice and some really funny moments, but (not exaggerating this) it is likely the most vulgar book I have ever read. I guess the title should have given it away, but man! After reading the book I watched one of the authors movies and realized it's just how he operates. If your interested in making a low budget film and truly think you will try and distribute it and/or show it at a film festival, this book has good advice. Just wish it had about 1000 less filthy words in it."
4,hiimareview,"Make Your Own Damn Movie!: Secrets of a Renegade Director is a combination of argot and total garbage to make something like filmmaking like getting to first base with your sister. Sometimes confusing with mixtures of terms like art and production-value, it makes enough sense to get by at times. I thoroughly enjoyed the blend of filming nomenclature and personal experience to create something that teaches as well as entertains. Though dry at times with ""extensive"" explanations of terms and occupations, it sets out to do what Lloyd Kaufman intended to do in his first book."
1,High School Potty Mouth,"You don't have to be a prude to be fully offended by this piece of trash! The author apparently does not posses enough English language prowess to write any one paragraph without lacing it with EXTREMELY rank, foul, and profane language. (And I'm not talking about hells & damns!) I really wanted to glean some information on the industry, but just could not abide his inability to write above a trailer-trash level. You are welcome to my copy. You will find it in the bottom of the trash bin."
5,Not for dreamers or wannabes,"This book in equal measure shows the why, how to, with what, and how to go abouts, in the world that is indie film. It's frankness is refreshing and it's honesty will either turn you away from the dream or cement your determination to create art. Don't think of it so much as a step by step guide, if you're looking for that go and get ""film making for dummies"", instead think of it more as a personal account of a film schlockmister who tells you that with unswerving determination, dedication, and an unfalling ability to let ""no"" roll off your back as well as having the conviction it takes to learn to defficate in a paper bag, that you as well can ""Make Your Own Damn Movie."""
5,Great reading even if you are not a filmmaker,"This book is a great and hilarious read even you are not trying to make your own damn movie. Written by the B-MOVIE King himself, Lloyd Kaufman, about his experiences making his own movies on tight budgets. If you are a filmmaker looking to learn how to make features on the cheap, or for laugh out loud reading, this book is full of both. Nothing but high praises for this great book. Thanks Lloyd."
5,Lloyd Kaufman is a GOD,"Lloyd Kaufman... What can I say?? He IS a GOD as far as I am concerned! I love Toxie, Tromaville, and everything about Troma. It is because of Lloyd that I have started making my own damn movies. Yes, I really am making my own damn movies. Without this book - I would have been lost. (OK, I am still a little lost, as making movies is hard work, but Lloyd has helped me out!) This book is a MUST for learning the ""ins and outs"" of low budget film making. I have learned so much from Lloyd and this book. It is a great read and above all - It is funny!!! Nothing dull and boring here - Lloyd makes it fun to read this book. Even if you are not making your own damn movie, it is still a great read for any Troma, Toxie, or Lloyd Kaufman fan. Also - I was lucky enough to meet Lloyd Kaufman recently and now I have an autographed copy of this book!!! That makes it priceless in my eyes!! Absolutely PRICELESS. Long live Toxie... Long live LLOYD KAUFMAN!!!!"
5,A Damn fine book,"Lloyd Kaufman's latest masterpiece isn't a film...it's this book, which gives an amatuer film maker the high's and low's of independent film making. As a film maker myself, I found myself reliving movie making moments of my own, since Lloyd describes his stories and memories in such vivid detail. And Trent Hagga does a great job as well, complimenting Lloyd's words and advice with some of his own.Whether you want to make your own damn movie or not, this is a great read, and comes highly recommended."
4,I have never seen a Troma film I liked but...,"That doesn't mean you won't enjoy this book or Lloyd Kaufman's exhaustive, yet candid, funny and didactic conversation of the movie making business. If you've ever wanted to make a film or better yet have, then you will discover that you and Lloyd Kaufman share the same passion and probably the same headaches. There are loads of useful ideas and detailed horror stories that I have and look forward to experiencing myself and for anyone crazy enough to do what a lot of people say they're going to do but never do. This book is definately worth it's Amazon price (which is cheaper than a round trip cab fare to your NYC film school class). It's definately worth your time!"
5,Brilliant!,"If you are someone who has wanted to work in movies, is fascinated by movies or hell, even seen a movie. You should give this book a read. Written by Lloyd Kaufman (of Troma fame)who has crafted the perfect bible for guerrilla filmmaking. Co-written by long time collaborators Trent Haaga and Adam Jahnke you receive an in depth look into the behind the scenes of movie making right from preproduction through marketing and release. It's witty, informative and includes hilarious banter between the authors on every page. I can't recommend this book enough.Kaufman has three other books out on the subject of film making: All I Need to Know about Filmmaking I Learned from the Toxic Avenger, Produce Your Own Damn Movie!, and Direct Your Own Damn Movie! Check them out too."
5,F**king Awesome,It helps a lot. I got some great ideas and tips from this book. The things they tell you to do are supported by real life stories.Hight Five Lloyd! :)
5,bookoo inspiration/ help,"this book has helped me more than any other.well, all i need to know about filmmaking i learned from the toxic avenger is also as good as this one.you learn tricks, tips, secrets, jokes, and all about the coolest idependent film industry in the business.this book inspires you to create YOUR movies and ideas.with all the garbage out today- this film help to get you started on your own art, to make films better and beyond what is out today.id say only get this book if you have a interest in films and want to create something better than you've already seen.Lloyd has been making 10 cent movies for longer than i can remember- and i think he knows a little bit about what hes doing. >;)there are no films like Troma- foreign or otherwise,and this book will help you make your own DAMN MOVIE!"
5,This is a great book.,"It pisses me off when people talk about the credibility of Lloyd Kaufman as a director when writing reviews for this book. The book isn't about making a GOOD movie, it's about making A movie. And it's great. It put the whole film industry and the procedure of making a movie into perspective for me, and it made me laugh my ass off at the same time. I couldn't put this down; I read the whole thing in three days. Buy and read this if you're ever considering getting in to the film industry but have no idea where to start."
5,Great Book By A Great Man,"Lloyd Kaufman is the man behind Troma and the creator of characters like the Toxic Avenger. Now you can learn his secrets and make your own damn movie. The book is informative and very funny. If you are a would be filmmaker and/or a fan of Troma this book is a must read and one that will never be on Oprah's list. Also the novel of the Troma classic The Toxie Avenger is now available, learn the origin of the first superhero from New Jersey."
5,From The Trenches,"Lloyd Kaufman has been there. He knows his stuff. He was making movies when I was picking my nose and screaming for McDonalds. Point is, he really knows low budget filmmaking. This book is packed full of nuggets of wisdom from today's greatest living TRUE indie filmmaker. From casting to post production, he covers it all in a style that is both insightful and entertaining. Even if I wasn't an independent filmmaker, I'd read it on the entertainment factor alone.I highly recommend this to aspiring filmmakers and film buffs alike. I've just ordered The Toxic Avenger novel and I can't wait to see how he applies his unique style to fiction writing."
5,For Those Independent Souls,I bought this book because it has been my lifelong dream to make my own movies. I got that from my dad because we both want to make movies. I am unable to go to film school *though I just got in* so I checked out this book. It's a really great book for those people that don't really have a lot of money to go to expensive schools but still want to make movies. Lloyd is an awesome leader and role model and you will definitely feel like you know him and can make movies like he does after you've read this book and joined the scores of independent film fans/makers. Check it out if you've ever had any interest in any aspect of film! You won't regret it!!!!
5,"Lloyd for President, not Mayor.","In these horribly drab times it's so refreshing to read Lloyd Kaufman's get-up-and-go attitude with regard to independent film making. This should be an inspiration to many who simply want to see their work on a screen of some sort, instead of mouldering on paper at home, or in someone's never-to-be-read, slush pile. Or want to take it further and promote it.It would not be beyond the bounds of possibility for it to screened on a moderately large screen using a digital projector. Sort of run your own damned cinema to screen your own damn movie, as others in America had to do with their own damn projector lugged around in the back of a car, in the 40's and 50's. Or set up a web sever like Exeter Studios have done to distribute their output to the world. Broadband required."
5,Make Your Own Damn Movie,I loved this book.The author must be very wise and handsome;clearly he is talented.
2,Interesting Book,"This is an interesting book for Troma fans and independent film fans. It is really just a book that is meant to entertain and tell stories rather than provide real helpful insight about how to make films. While I appreciate the show of support for independent art, the book doesn't really seem to support independent creation other than Troma's own brand (despite the title of the book). While I will admit that the book is very funny to read, I think sometimes it crosses into somewhat arrogant and self-important banter.To me this book is more about Troma patting itself on the back and reflecting on their wacky stories then about really empowering anyone but themselves. Read if you are a fan of Troma, not if you are looking for encouragement."
5,Now I'm a fan,"I'd never actually seen a Troma movie before I read this book. I don't think I would have been able to appreciate them the same way I do now that I've read the book and seen a couple Troma videos. Although I'm not sure I want to follow in the author's footsteps, I admire the way he's made a name for himself. I think there's more practical information in this book than in many of my text books."
3,Economic Solutions,"This book provides an economic analysis of traffic in urban America. Using data from major cities, the researchers try to uncover the problems with our current urban transportation networks and offer economically sound solutions. Among the problems noted are congestion from suburban traffic and poorly used heavy rail systems. Among the solutions proposed are new rail networks and a time-sensitive toll on all urban highways. The only point that disappointed me was the analysis the purpose of travel and how it was interlaced with the ideas for solutions, but otherwise this was a good text. The reader should be warned that this is a specialized economic report, not written on the popular level. Undergraduate and graduate seminars could find this book very useful for discussion or as a basis for further study."
2,Buyer Beware (or not),"This CD isn't exactly what it seems. While there are many recordings of classical music pieces performed by music boxes, other cheesy synthesizer sounds have also been added. While many of the music boxes are really 'real' (there is some mechanical noise in the recordings) others are suspiciously clean, leading me to believe that they are really synthesized sounds. All of the recordings are drenched in reverb, making it sound as though the entire CD was recorded in a cave. There is no information about who recorded this album, or where it was recorded. It merely says ""The publishers would like to thank the museums, collectors, archives, and art libraries for their cooperation"" although it doesn't get more specific than that.If you are looking for something to throw on to calm your kid, this CD is probably fine. I purchased it hoping for artistic alternate performances of pedagogical piano pieces to share with my students. I am somewhat disapointed."
2,Can't really do anything with this now,I wanted to use this cable in conjuntion with an rs232 adapter to configure a Hewlett Packard switch but no luck connecting my terminal emulator. I ended up going on ebay and ordering a genuine HP black RS232 cable that I knew would work. I don't know if it's the pinout but all I know is I am stuck with a beige serial cable that I have no use for.
3,missing activation code,can't believe that they left out the activation code. quality control was sleeping on the job. had to contact dxo for the code.had not had a chance to use it yet so i can't provide testimony as to results but i have high anticipation based on other reviews i've read.
5,Love This Book!,"This is a very informative book on dolls and their fashions from 1959 to 1994. For me, it's like a blast from the past. Growing up in the 1960's, this book brought back some wonderful memories. I enjoyed the pictures of movie and television stars and their films that were associated with the different dolls. I would highly recommend this book! This book was bought from Amazon through my husband's account."
5,Love at First Sight,"The minute I opened this book I was hooked: Great recipes, fabulous illustrations and a joy to read. It's been my favorite for years; you'll never find another one like this."
4,Good recipes and good ideas,This is an older cookbook and in excellent shape. I like it because I am trying to cook more healthy meals for my family.
4,Fun reading,Excellent book and fun to read. Enjoyed the character Frost and his constant struggle with consequences of having the Demon Blade.
3,Confusing and Intriguing,"It's about this great and powerful sorcerer named ""Frost"" and this mystic McGuffin artifact ""The Demon Blade"". Frost is the keeper of the artifact, a job he doesn't particularly want, but it's too dangerous otherwise. Most intriguing thing about the book is the magic system which involves mages becoming extremely fat because doing magic takes energy in stored calories directly from their bodies. So mages can only go 'all out' about once every few months, and the weight management can be havoc on their systems.I found the book confusing because of the high amount of characters and intrigue. It felt like the middle of a series, but I found out coming here that it was a prequel. I guess it was written after the main story, because there were references I didn't get.Overall the magic system carried the book; the characterization was lackluster and superficial. An 'OK' offering if you like fantasy and strange magics."
1,"well, it certainly chilled me!","I read a lot of SF and fnatasy for pleasure and usually will finish a book even if it's not very good. This one, however, I had trouble even skimming.Confusing and not very interesting plot with characters that lacked depth. And on top of that it was full of typos in the parts I did read. A total waste of time and money, IMHO."
1,A Really Poor Biography,"Most reviews give a description of the book, and then rate it according to a number of criteria. In this case, however, there really isn't much to say, as Quesnal's story is -- at least in comparison to the tales of other bikers -- uninteresting. Very little is actually revealed about Quesnal's time with the HA, and one gets the sense that Quesnal is more concerned about portraying an innocent facade than he is about telling the truth. This is a poor choice for anyone, but especially for those trying to learn a little about the so-called biker brotherhood."
1,I was a killer for the Hells Angels: The Story of Serge,Not a very good or entertaining book. More of a ramblimg egomaniac's diary. The book did not contain much detail on the events and jumped around way too much. He tries to make himself into a heavy and when it got hot he turned.
1,Money making scheme for author,Very poor insight into the Red and White which is why I bought the book.Comes across as a wannabe who could'nt cut it when the going got tough.
1,sing loud and cash the check,A rat is a rat......is a rat. I guess this guy and others like him (see Henry Hill and Sammy the Bull) feel if they can make some money getting average citizens to read about their exploits maybe they can justify (to themselves) their betrayal of their friends and brothers. You'd be wise to save your money and not make these kinds any richer...especially one like this who is short on details when it comes to his association with the Angels. In my opinion he only used their name to help sell the book. Don't bother. Read Sonny's instead.
4,Una verdadera ayuda,"La Actitud Mental Positiva Un Camino Hacia El Exito, es un libro que todos debemos leer, ya que nos hace cambiar nuestra forma de ver las cosas, nos enseña que todas las situaciones de la vida tienen dos caras, una mala y otra buena. Este libro indica que camino tomar para ver el lado positivo de las cosas y haciéndonos cambiar nuestro punto de vista para nuestro bien. Realmente vale la pena no solo leerlo sino relerlo y estudiarlo para así tener una guia de actuacion que nos traera mucho provecho."
2,just spend the money on stamps,"First of all I think the first person to comment must be the author because this book is so not worth it. I only purchased this book for knowledge, I work for the post office. This book was written yrs ago and the things that apply to it don't really work so well today. The whole book could have been summed up with ""just reuse a stamp if you can"" sure you can get away with it here and there. In one instance the author tells you to place tape over stamp to hold in place. Well I've been working for the post office for 12yrs and have never seen a stamp with tape over it make it through. Nor have I ever seen half a stamp get through the system. There are loopholes but this author obviously is oblivious to them. If you want to save money don't buy this book."
3,Crappy Little Gem,"This book is fairly out of date, and pretty useless. The best this book tells you how to do is scam the post office out of a few cents on some letters. Honestly, as much as I enjoy remembering snail mail; I never use it, and I'm sure you don't either. This book isn't going to tell you how to ship $70 packages for free; it's going to tell you how to scam the post office out of a first class stamp or two.That being said, this is a classically written Loompanics Unlimited book. The front cover is funny, and I really enjoy having it in my collection of odd books. Also, the information in the book seems to be fairly accurate and well tested. This gives it a big ""neat"" factor.The book is useless, nonetheless. But enjoyable.Buy it for fun, or for your odd collection."
4,It works on my 2yr old niece,I bought this product for my 2 year old niece that has a bad case of eczema. She stayed with me over the summer and it hurt my heart to see her scratching her face to the point of bleeding. I immediately looked to Amazon for a cure and found one! My sister claims its still working great and keeps my little darlings skin moisturized to the point that she doesn't scratch. Highly Recommended!
3,Not that impressed,My daughter has horrible Eczema. After reading some of the reviews I decided to try this cream. At first it seemed to help but it was very short lived. Not that impressed with the product.
4,Too high,Im tryin to see why this product went up i was payin $11 an some change for it now it sky rocket it high.the first time i order it it was.
5,Vanicream,"This is the BEST product I have ever used on my sensitive skin. I am allergic to so many things and this is by far the best product I have found to not only soothe irritated skin, but also prevent dryness .I highly recommend it"
5,Great product,Suggested by a doctor and it is a very nice product. Really helps if you have got dry skin. The pump dispenser is quite helpful. I would recommend this product by all means.
5,great,"Thick and creamy lotion that adds tons of moisture to my skin. I think it's wonderful during the winter months when the heat makes my skin very dry. It's made for sensitive skin, I can even use it right after shaving without breaking out into a rash. The lotion is also unscented so all of you manly-men out there can use it too!"
5,Great lotion!,"I get this via subscribe and save because we go through a lot at my house. My daughters both have mild eczema, and this works well to keep it at bay. They get it all over after bath, and I use it on my hands constantly, especially in dry Colorado winter weather. Having the pump dispenser is really nice, although there is quite a bit at the bottom that you have to just open up the container to get. But, we love this stuff!"
4,Smells,I use this on my legs only before I go to bed at night because I'm not crazy about the smell.... Don't get me wrong it's not strong but still I don't really like the smell too much. BUt it is amazing for your skin. If I didn't like the affects so well I wouldn't use it.
4,Good Lotion,I bought this for my toddler's very sensitive skin and it works although it is not the best lotion cream.
5,Highly recommended,"VaniCream products are -in a word- amazing. This particular lotion is very VERY thick, a little goes a long way. This is great to use on dry feet or very dry hands...it might be a little much for every day use, but for extremely dry skin, it's fabulous. Once you rub it in, give it a couple of minutes to ""soak in,"" and it wont feel so heavy. For everyday use (legs and arms), there is a ""Light"" moisturizer that works beautifully. It might not seem glamorous or attractive to use products with no ""fresh scent"" or sparkles or what-not, but I promise, these products are so great and I recommend them to anyone who asks me. Very happy Customer."
1,BHT?,"I was about to purchase this Vanicream as I used it in the past and liked it for a sunscreeen. But, I just saw that it contains BHT, a cancer causing ingredient so I will not buy it an longer. I wont even buy my dog anything with BHT in it ! Too bad, as it did work well."
1,Smells like rotting cheese.,"This stuff smells gross. I left the top open a few days to air it out in hopes it would help the smell. It might have helped slightly... but I can't believe anyone would buy this crap more than once. Are all the reviews fake? Haha. I'm sure as a product it works fine, I just don't feel like smelling it, so it's going in the trash and I'll go back to Eucerin."
2,Much prefer CeraVe for my son's eczema,"I really wanted to like this, but it just wasn't as effective in clearing up my son's eczema as CeraVe. I did purchase 2 orders to give it a fair try. The second order had leaked out during shipping (about 25% of the product). On a positive note, I do like the thick consistency and the pump dispenser. However, for the price and effectiveness, I prefer other products."
5,Great cream for sensitive skin,"I start using this cream for my 6yo daughter after her dermatologist recommended it. She has a sensitive skin and suffers from eczema and rashes. This cream is great for her especially in the winter when the skin gets drier. Lately, I have been starting to use it too when my skin feels dry and it works great.Btw, I used to buy it directly from the dermatologist for $25 and I am so happy I found it on Amazon for half the price"
1,Didn't work for my son,"I purchased this product based on all the positive reviews. After using it for two weeks, my son's skin becomes rash and bumpy like never before. This cream did nothing to control my son's eczema skin condition. I didn't expect this cream to cure my son's eczema but at least is should improve or control his skin condition. It did nothing. This product might work for others but it didn't work for my son."
3,Just Ok. Does not treat dryness or flakiness.,"I searched the internet for a cream that would treat dryness and flakiness. This is not it. The flakes are still there and you will have to re-apply the cream throughout the day. There is no hydration. The cream is very thick, like vaseline, and goes on like a film and sits there for a few minutes, it does not absorb quickly. This cream is just ok. If you have dry skin and looking for relief, look elsewhere."
3,So-so,"This is really interesting, because I don't consider myself to have sensitive skin at all. I only bought this because I saw that all the other reviews were great, my friend recommended it to me, and I needed a moisturizer for the winter.Everyone said it was also okay to use on the face, so I did. However, not even 6 hours later, my skin started to break out, which hasn't happened (other than the occasional pimple) in more than 5 years.I've been using Clean & Clear with no problems, so I guess my skin is just really weird!Even though it was horrible for my face, the product was great for moisturizing the rest of my body so far, so I will keep using it until it runs out, but I probably won't buy it again."
5,"Best moisturizer for extremely dry, flaky skin",My skin has been extremely dry for many years now that it tends to be flaky (skin sloughing off) specially during the winter season.I often rely on reviews by other people so i search Amazon and this is by far most recommended by many.I happened to be at Meijers and this 1 pound pump was on sale for $10.49 so i bought just to try. I am so glad i did...It's the most moisturizing lotion i have ever used. It has a thick consistency and yet non greasy when you apply. It penetrates right away under the skin. I used it after i take a shower when pores are still open. I used it on my elbows and heels (put socks on afterwards). My mom and brother are both hooked on this that we put this on the living room.You just gotta try this one. It really works. Best to buy the 1 pound pump.
5,Orange Tea,"Tangerine Orange Tea is wonderful. The rich flavor allows more life to the tea bags. It makes perfect icy tea. (I do not drink hot tea.) It doesn't take long to make. I love it because I don't even have to ""brew"" it; I simply put it in my water bottle with water, stick it in the freezer, and I have icy tea in no time. Ths tea would be perfect with an orange muffin - or any flavor muffin.I recommend this tea to any tea lover."
2,VM on the decline,"If this CD is your first exposure to VM, you may well enjoy it. However, if you got to this one via the stellar ""Elf"" (with former vocalist Anita Lipnicka) and enjoyable ""Ego"" (the first with the more terrestrial Kasia Stankiewicz), you will probably agree that VM has lost its spark. You will find no song like ""Wolne Ptaki"" or ""Orla Cien"" here. Kasia and the band sound a little bored with their own material. Better to check out Anita Lipnicka's excellent solo CDs to discover who got the better end of her split with VM. (Hint: she did.)"
4,Fine Beginner's Text,"This is Microsoft approved courseware geared toward passing the Proficient Level MOUS Exam. Since I reviewed from this text to pass the Expert Level exam, I would not know if the exercises are sufficient for the Proficient Level exam. However, to pass the Expert Level exam, you must study from this book with its companion: Excel 97 Step By Step Advanced. Any other advanced books and some work experience is beneficial as well. The tasks provide fundamental knowledge but Accountants and other more spreadsheet intensive positions may need study aids focused on Excel's more advanced analytical, mathematical, and statistical functions."
2,No Subtitles,Looks like it would have been a good movie if it had subtitles. I dont speak spanish so it was of no use to me.
1,Don't buy this DVD unless you speak perfect spanish!,"Bought the DVD, it claims to have the english subtitles which do not exist and cannot be turned on. There is no menu where they can be turned on and you cannot do it with the remote controller. A pity because I heard that the movie is excellent!"
2,I want to throw it,"This phone is not ergonomical for big human hands and it's easily dropped. Once you drop the phone then your done. It will never work the same again. It usually takes a few careless moments to destroy a phone. This phone interferes with my radios and computer when I place it near them, it causes them(radio and computer) to release a high pitch squeal of some sort.It looks, feels and sounds like junk. Run away, run far away from this offer."
1,Unnecessarily complex!,"I was really excited about getting this phone especially since I'm not happy using a flip phone. Sadly, trying to figure out this phone is almost impossible. Common things like Address Book seem to be buried under several layers of menu. It's weirdly complex to try and figure out how to work it. In addition, it shut itself off in the middle of calls. I'm returning mine."
5,Wonderful acapella vocal harmonies,"This is not the Beach Boys or CSNY. This is three English singers doing old English, Irish and Scottish folk songs. The harmonies are NOT modern. Probably the closest we've heard is Pentangle or The John Renbourn Group, or perhaps Blackmore's Night. None of these singers has a really wonderful voice, but they all do sing on pitch, and they blend well. Medieval harmonies can really sound ""clanky"" to modern ears, but once you are used to it, it is beautiful stuff. I highly recommend this CD. ""The Lyke Wake Dirge"", a 14th century pagan dirge borrowed (stolen?) by the church in the 16th century, is worth the price of the CD, no matter what you pay for it."
2,Product I received seems watered down,"I bought Enjoy hydrating shampoo and conditioner the first time on a recommendation from a beauty product store in the local mall. It has been amazing, and makes my hair look great. Recently, I'm running out and have been too busy to get back to that same store, so I decided to replenish my supply through Amazon. The product I got from the mall is very thick, and I only needed a little bit. When I opened the bottle I received from Amazon the first time and tipped it into my hand, the shampoo came pouring out so fast. Also, I had to use a lot more of it to get it to lather. I am wondering if someone watered down the product. Has anyone else had this problem? I have no complaints about Enjoy shampoo, but I might take the extra time and get it from a brick and mortar store next time."
2,Do not purchase from this seller,"This Shampoo was extremely watered down. Not worth the money. I've bought the product from a salon and knew the difference. The product itself is a great shampoo but from this seller, not so much."
2,Lacking a description,"This product is not properly labeled on Amazon. I received the product, looked at the back... and it said it was for coarse, curly hair! I was so annoyed. I paid all that money for a product I couldn't use. I give it two stars, though, because the seller offered to refund my money if I shipped it back unused. I didn't want to spend more money on shipping, so I gave it to a friend. He likes it, and it smells good."
1,Product was too thin to use,"The product is slightly thicker than water, not the normal consistency at all. I am unable to even pour it into my hand to get it up to my head. Runs through fingers like water."
1,"Really, really disappointed in the seller.","The product was either mixed or swapped with another product. I've used enjoy for a long time and this didn't smell like it (the scent was way too strong, I can't find any reviews that say the product formula changed) and I don't think what was put in the bottle was sulfate free, which I realized before it touched my hair, thank goodness."
5,There are some books that MUST be read,"For a brief moment, I think the most cynical person can give pause to enjoy this wonderful collection of sweepingly emotional and thoughtful letters. I have read, re-read and given away many, many copies of Rainier Maria Rilke's ""Letters To A Young Poet"".Rarely does a day go by without me thinking of something from this book. Rilke's ideas about love, youth and solitude are remarkable, and until this day I still find infinite wisdom and solace from his writings.Some books really don't need much more explaining then to say: READ IT!"
4,Short but Sweet,"Really enjoyed this short read. I'm a bit older now but would say this would be a better book for a 20 something person than later in life. The topics about women, work, isolation, and calm seem to more overtly state what The Cather in the Rye is narrating. All in all a good short read to remind you of the confusion of youth and how to deal with it."
3,3/10 Good Letters,There are three interesting letters out of the ten included in the book. I almost wonder why this is printed and exchanged so much.
3,R&M tulip cookie cutter,"This cutter arrived in time. Beautiful shape, nicely done, just when using you have to be very careful as it is quite small form and dough has to slovly relised from cutter. It's a little bit too small for my needs but otherwise it is a good buy."
3,A good guide to kayaking in Northern California,"Book does a great job of describing kayaking areas in northern california. It rates them as beginner, intermediate and so on and describes what these classification means. Overall it is great what it does. Why not 5 stars? Because the selection of kayaking sites is quite limited, I wish the guide was larger to include more areas. For example, I am interested in kayaking in Mono Lake or in Delta but the book does not include these two popular areas for Kayaking. An extented new edition would be welcome."
3,kelp,"wow this stuff tastes nasty! but i got it because of the fall out from japan ,might not ever know if it helps or not but i guess its better the not doing anything"
3,Stopped using but not because of product,I took this product for a few days because I heard it was good for fat loss. I stopped taking it because I was getting a rash on my body but found out it wasn't the kelp. I am going to start taking it again and hopefully get a better review in.
5,I wouldn't be without this for more than a few days,"I really like this product. I figured out about ten years ago that despite salting almost everything, my iodine level was too low. My nails snapped off when I pulled on my socks, and my energy level had plummeted. I tried the compressed kelp pills but that was too much iodine for me (my skin got very oily, a known side effect of excess iodine). It's very hard to get too much iodine in terms of having an adverse effect on your health, but if you take too much you can get oily skin. The Nature's Way kelp capsules work very well for me. I take one a day before bed and my nails no longer break off or splinter and my energy level is good. I definitely recommend it if you think you might be iodine deficient (is your energy low, do your nails break easily?)"
2,Makes me get nauseous and feel sick to my stomach,"I wasn't sure if it was the pills or not so I decided to test them, one day i'd take 2 pills the next day I would go without one and so on. After a week and a half I found that this product makes me get dizzy, nauseous and feel sick to my stomach."
1,no change,took it everyday for about 3 weeks. After the 3 weeks I experienced terrible constipation and no change in energy or activity level. It did the opposite for me. This is a personal experience and should not be used as a way to determine if this product is right for you. Please consult a physician before starting any supplements or vitamins.
5,Not Bad,I havnt been taking this consecutively everyday so I cant tell if it helps...but I will edit this post after I get back on the ball of taking my supplements. I need one of those daily boxes....im lazy. LOL! Order came fast and was as expected.
2,Kelp for Thyroid,I don't take these on a regular basis so I can't say if they do anything or not. I will continue to take them unitl they are gone.
1,fraud,It says 180 caps. but there are only 93 capsules in the bottle. So it is misguided advertisement. So actually you are going to pay 11 dollars for 180 pills.
1,Buyer beware!,"Compare these two statements from the product descriptions:*""This species of kelp grows in coastal ocean waters from 1 to 10 feet deep with the tide.""*""Kelp is collected from deep in the ocean because Kelp close to shore may absorb many heavy metals and toxins.""Anybody see a contradiction here? It doesn't say THIS kelp is collected from deep in the ocean - it says just the opposite.In fact, kelp DOESN'T grow ""deep in the ocean"" - it grows ONLY in shallow water up to 250 feet deep. By ocean standards, 250 feet is shallow, and it's ""close to shore."" Frankly, I think Nature's Way doesn't know what it's talking about."
4,Fingers crossed for anti-inflammatory properties,"Recently, I started taking these tablets given the documented anti-inflammatory properties of kelp. As many other variables have changed, it is impossible to ascribe any positive benefits to this product. If you Google top anti-inflammatory products, kelp generally makes the top ten list. Currently I am taking all ten (or more) and the results have been positive."
4,Good Alternative to Eating Kelp,"These capsules are no bigger than my vitamin C.Taking once daily and so far no taste issues or repeating.No sure if its a direct effect or not, time will tell, but even in the high humiditythese seem to reduce my inflamation.Also I noticed that I do experience more hunger when I have forgotten to take one.Will update review once i have been taking them for a full two months to see what other effects they have."
4,kelp,not sure yet if this helps. Takes a while for it to get into your system. I sure hope it helps as I have a hard time losing weight and think its my thyroids.
4,Great price,love this natures way kelp and amazon has a great price! The caps are not too big to swallow which is important.
5,Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors,This is by far the best one yet!!! The range of emotions is amazing....All of the songs on the album are songs that we can all relate to. 5 stars is not enough!
4,Tim McGraw and The Dancehall Doctors,"Tim McGraw and The Dancehall Doctors is a timeless country cd. The cd includes songs about love, having a broken heart, and taking it easy; all of which are easy to relate to and catchy lyrics to sing along to and an awesome beat. Whether you want slow or upbeat music this cd has a combination of both. My favorite songs include: ""She's My Kind of Rain"" a song about love, ""Red Ragtop"" a song about relationship troubles, and ""Thats Why God Made Mexico"" a song about removing yourself from hard or complicated situations.I would recommend buying this album because people will be able to identify and take personal meaning with these songs. Even if you are not a huge country fan this cd incorporates a beat that would appeal to pop fans as well. Tim McGraw and The Dancehall Doctors is one cd you can listen to all the way through and enjoy."
1,Pathetic,"Tim McGraw represents virtually everything that is wrong with country music today. His relience on gimmicked, overproduced and formulaed songs have everything to do with marketing and nothing to do with the authentic traditions that are supposed to be present in country music. This is ""music"" for people who don't like country but think that they do. Pass."
1,Billy Ray Lives,"Has it ever occurred to anyone that Tim McGraw and Billy Ray Cyrus are actually the SAME person? Think about it. Both are no talent pretty boys who have managed to convince an almost exclusively female audience that they make actual country music. The clincher is that you NEVER see them together. Pass folks, and flee from this one as if your life depends on it."
2,i want a refund,"This cd is the worst cd this guy has released to date, it's full of songs that alot of artists would consider filler tunes on their own releases, it just seems overproduced and forced, these songs have very little to offer as far as what the singer offers to them all though a few are well crafted which, the writers deserve credit for"
1,not an outlaw,"For anyone who listens and appreciates what country music was and should be again, this is not the album for you. Tim may use his road band like Waylon and Merle, but he is not the same type of guy. While guys like Waylon and Johnny Cash lived hard and played hard, Tim is just like the establishment they were rebelling against. Save your money and buy something by Radney Foster, or Bruce Robison, whose version of ""Angry all the time"" kick the hell out of TIm and Faith's version."
2,Not his best,Tim has had better albums. Personally I'm not crazy about thuis one. It's my least favorite.
5,Tim blows me away with this one!,"Never have I been so anxious to get my hands on a new CD and believe me I was not at all disappointed by it! The entire CD is so pure. My favorites are ""Watch the Wind Blow BY"" and ""Real Good Man"". With ""Watch the Wind..."" you get the feeling of lying in the grass with a new love and truly not caring about anything else but that moment. It brings back all the feelings of being in love. With ""Real Good Man"" it just makes you smile. It captures why ""cowboys"" always get the girl! I love every song on it more each time I play it. A real winner for Tim all the way!"
5,Tim McGraw: Entertainer of the Year EVERY YEAR!!,"I have been a Tim fan since he came onto the scene. This album has by far surpassed anything he has ever done. Accompanying Tim on this album is the best stage band I have ever had the pleasure of seeing live, the Dancehall Doctors. This album mixes a little country with some rock and best of all, this album is TOTALLY TIM. Anyone contemplating buying this album should just do it and you will fall in love with this man's talent. This would make a great gift for any TIM fan.McGrawsGirl (i-squad user)"
5,one of the best albums ever,this one of tim mcgraws best albums i think i love tim and faith and all they're songs.if your thinking of buying this album and you like him go ahead i love it and i reccomend faith hill's cry . i am a big tim and faith and you won't be dissapointed i promise
5,Tim McGraw & the Dance Hall Doctors,"This album is awesome. Tim & the DHD's did a great job. There is a bit of everything on it...slow, fast, you name it, it's there. I really like Tim's music. I like how he isn't afraid to sing about controversial topics. Such as Red RagTop. It is a great song with a message that life does go on despite the choices we make, right or wrong. Also love That's Why God made Mexico, Comfort Me...heck really there isn't a song I don't like on the album. Great choice!"
5,Tim Mcgraw & Dancehall Doctors,"As I am fairly a new Tim Mcgraw fan I would have to say that this is a awesome CD, I've always liked country but Tim's music on this cd hit home to me with alot of meaning behind his songs. My favorite is She's My Kind Of Rain. Tim has excellent taste in his music with the tones he uses. I can't wait for new songs to arrive because I know they will be great! Thanks Tim"
5,Tim McGraw & The Dancehouse Doctors Must Buy!!!,"This CD is amazing. I truely recommend everyone to give country a try. This is the CD which will make you fall in love with the new wave of modern country. For all Tim McGraw fans and country lovers, your CD collection will not be complete without this truely riveting set of new songs. Get ready to feel goosebumps when Tim McGraw sings Elton John's song, Tin Dancer. It is amazing."
5,He's Just the best (sapphireblue78),"Tim McGraw has come a long way from Welcome to the Club. So many of his songs have gone straight to #1! This new album (Tim McGraw and the Dance Hall Doc.) has shown just what this man is made of. Real Good man just gives you goose bumps. What can you say about this man, He's arrived!"
5,Tim's Best Ever!,"Tim's latest CD is a wonder. He broke the Nashville rules to record an album with his road band, a very talented group, the Dancehall Doctors. Not only are the songs great, catchy tunes, the band really meshed with Tim's lyrical voice to make a true, LIVE experience for the listener. This is as close to the concert sound and feel as you can get in a studio. It was a very brave act on the part of Tim and his producers, and, in my opinion, it has paid off very nicely. I hope they never use studio musicians again!BUY THIS CD! You'll fall in love!"
5,One of Tim's Best So Far,Tim has done it again. I really enjoy listening to Tims' music. He keeps up with the times and still keeps it country. There aren't too many more out there like Tim. His music is fresh and uplifting. And the band is just awesome. I have to say I saw them in concert and the sound and music and Tims voice for 2 and a half hours wasn't enough for me on the way home I popped his CD in and listened to him all the way home. I definately would recommed this cd to all the true Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors fans. If you can't see him live then this cd is the next best thing.
5,It doesn't get any better than this,"I have been a the biggest Tim McGraw fan since I can remember. I have seen him in concert everytime he has been in town. I went out and purchased this CD the morning it came out. Every song on this cd is so easy to listen to. From the ballads to the new sound with old feelings to it. I have to say one of my favorite songs is ""Tiny Dancer"". I loved it when he sang it at one of his concerts and when I heard it was going to be on the CD I was very happy. That is such a hard song to do and Tim McGraw and The Dance Hall Doctors make it look easy. Thanks Tim and the band for giving me and my family something we can all listen to!!"
5,Best work yet!,"I love this CD. You can really see how Tim McGraw has evolved over the years. This CD for me ranks right up there with the Eagles. The harmonies are awesome and the CD as a whole is very well done. I highly recommend it. However, if you are stuck in the typical country mode and don't appreciate wide ranges of music - you should skip it."
3,not one of his best,"This CD was not one of Tim's best. I bought it because I am a true Tim fan all the way, but I have to admit ""Set this Circus Down"" was much better. Not all the songs on this album were bad though, I really like ""Tickin' Away"", ""Comfort Me"", and of course ""She's My Kind of Rain"", but the others sounded like they were somewhat thrown together to make a full album. But if you're a Tim fan, go ahead and buy it---its still worth the money...his voice is always comforting on a bad day."
5,HOT,"My fave country artist...amazing cd, amazin vocalist....all rounder....brilliant. well worth investigation. just read some of the other reviews!! wish he'd tour Britain................."
3,Appalling,"Sorry, Tim...you just can't do that.I am a Nashville native like yourself, and have been impressed with the output of yourself and your gorgeous wife on the music front. You have made country exciting and mainstream once again by mixing in some pop sounds.However, you crossed the line when you tried to do a cover of an Elton John song. IT DON'T NEED NO TWANG, my friend. I admire your intentions, but this album would be much more appealing if you had left well enough alone and stuck with 14 tracks."
5,Tim McGraw -THE BEST just keeps getting BETTER!,"I can't stop listening to this CD! I've always listened to all Tim's cd's but since buying Tim McGraw and the DHD's that's all I'm listening to over and over. I love it and it's different than anything he's ever done before. My favorites are SLEEP TONIGHT (I love the chorus on that), ALL WE EVER FIND, WATCH THE WIND BLOW BY, and I KNOW HOW TO LOVE YOU WELL but I love every song on the cd. Tim's voice is perfect and the music is great with the sound of the fiddle, guitars, drums and keyboards standing out on different songs. They compliment each other so well."
5,Never thought Tim could BE better!,"SET THIS CIRCUS DOWN has not left my CD player since I bought it in August 2001. And I thought he would never top it. I was wrong! Thank God for Multi-Disc CD players, because TIM MCGRAW AND THE DANCEHALL DOCTORS just earned it's permanent spot! I also wanted to say that despite some opinions otherwise, I think Tim did a superb cover of TINY DANCER. I normally don't like it when artists do covers of other artists', especially one I love as much as Elton John. But it is obvious that Elton has put his stamp of approval on Tim's version, as he has already sung it with Tim duet style, and will again on national TV in January. It is a very soulful rendition! Another MUST PLAY, in my opinion is ""All we ever find"".. the soulful fiddle playin' on this one nearly brings me to tears. And Real Good Man..well that one just gives me chills! If you don't buy another CD this year, this is THE ONE!"
2,Not Up to Tim's Lofty Standards,"Tim McGraw is a tremendous entertainer. This CD is somewhat different and overall it does not measure up to the rest of his efforts. The proof is in the listening, not the reviewers or marketing of this product."
5,AWESOME!,"This CD is the best! Tim is so awesome! I can't say it's his best CD, because I think they're all great, but it's pretty close. He has some real heart in this one. I LOVE IT!!"
5,Tim Shows His Heart,"In my opinion, this is the best album yet by Tim McGraw. The songs show his maturity as a person and an artist, and show who he really is and where he's from."
5,Bestter Than the Best,"This album is a one of a kind. Using his own band was something he's wanted to do for years and they really did a great job. The songs from this album were really unique but yet they were still ""Tim"". Tim does music that fits to everyday life and fits most everyone's life. He feels his music and chooses songs that people WANT to hear. Not only do I think he's the most brilliant artist to do what HE wanted but he's the best husband and father. He should set an example for the entire population!!! Thanks for the music, Tim."
5,The best of all,This album is the best of all. I have all his album's and I would have to say this is the best one he has done so far. He really has out done himself on this album. I have to say if you don't have this album yet then what are u waiting for.
5,What a CD,"Alright, I'll admit. I bought this CD mostly b/c it was Tim McGraw and you know, I love him!!! But the style of the music and the way that their tones change and the mood is greatly set. This CD is one of Tim McGraw's best. It has upbeat songs, slow songs, songs that make you wanna cry, lol, others make you wanna laugh. I would totally recommend someone who is a great country fan to buy this album. It's one if his best yet."
3,Not As I Expected,"This CD wasn't as impressive as I expected. I do have to say that he did a great job with Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"", Tim sounds great singing in falseto.I personally enjoyed Tim McGraw's older stuff more, but then again I may be a little too traditional. Don't get me wrong, this CD still is a great work of art.I would only recommend this CD to a true Tim McGraw fan, if you're looking for a CD full of ""Hits"" you'd be better off with George Strait's ""The Road Less Traveled"", or Kenny Chesney's ""No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problem"". There are only a few good songs on this CD ""Red Ragtop"", ""Tiny Dancer"", ""Illegal"", and ""She's My Kind of Rain"". Maybe I just need to listen to the songs more often and perhaps they will grow on me."
5,It's Tim,"There isn't anything I haven't enjoyed by Tim McGraw. The day I moved into my new apartment I received this CD, we played it as my family put my new apartment together. I have heard many performers in my 77 + years but I have to admit ...he is my favorite Country Music performer.Enjoy."
5,One of his best and most honest albums ever,"It was really brave of Tim to go out and record the album with his band instead of studio musicians. It is because of this great idea that the album has more of a real sound to it. This album has some great upbeat songs like ""Who Are They"" as well as some wonderful ballads such as ""I Know How to Love You Well"". Some of my favorite songs on the album include ""That's Why God Made Mexico"" which has sort of a blues feel to it and ""She's My Kind of Rain"" which is his newest video. ""Red Ragtop"" has a lot of controversy surrounding it because a few lines in the song talk about the girl terminating her pregnancy, but the song isn't about that. It's just about young people in love and memories about what it was like back then. So if you want great music by a real band and a soothing voice to listen to, pick up Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors today!"
1,this is what they call talent thesedays?,"ok, if lack of talent is what you like,then this is the best cd ever made! i can't believe the music scene thesedays...it's like there's a contest to see who can make the worst music possible in the country music scene today,and ladies and gentlemen...i introduce king of the fools Tim McGraw! He doesn't play ,other that act like it by carrying an acoustic guitar around with him like it's attached to his body...and he doesn't write any lyrics...with sales declining, Tim is gasping for air and this hope of a lifeboat is sinking in the sea of worthless country music...avoid at all cost...read books and expand your mind you budweiser drinking,factory working, mind numbed masses!"
1,Not good,"At least Tim McGraw tried to be creative and do something a little different. But it was still feeble. He has an ""okay"" voice. HE CAN'T WRITE & CAN'T PLAY! That's all it takes for me to discredit him as nothing more than a shallow Nashville Pop Star. His cover of 'Tiny Dancer' is pretty pathetic. No self respecting Texan would buy any of his work. He is a pretty face marketed to the mindless masses, & young girls who know nothing about music. No different than Britney Spears, or any other pop stars that will be all but forgoten 10 years from now. No musical significance, except the significant headache received from listening."
5,Tim does it again,This guy is amazing.. Just when you think his CD's can't get any better....THEY DO! Tim Mcgraw and the Dance Hall Doctor's have so much talent. Everytime I listen to the CD I love it more and more. You can relate every song to something or someone in your life. When I heard people were offened by 2 of his songs I was amazed. How can you get angry for things that really happen in life. I promise this will be the BEST CD purchase and you will LOVE IT! :)
5,COWBOYBOB,"I own all of Tim McGraw's albums and this is his best album yet. You can hear he put alot into this album and the recording is very good. Some of the songs you will hear a new and improved Tim McGraw in his vocals and you also get that classic Tim McGraw voice that you can recognize the moment you hear it.She's my kind of rain and Red ragtop are very good. Sing me home and Real good man are classic Tim McGraw. If you are a Tim McGraw fan buy this album you will love it. If your not a fan, you soon will be when you purchase this album."
5,Tim is a great artist,"I have followed Tim McGraw since his self titled CD. I have all of his CD's and love them all, but I think this is one of the best. He has songs on all of his CD's that other fans can relate to but this one really hits home. I would recommed anyone to buy this CD."
5,Tim has done it again,"I am a huge Tim Mcgraw fan. I have never heard him sing a song that I didn't like. I didn't think he could top ""ALL I WANT"" or ""SET THIS CIRCUS DOWN"", but he has done it once again. He is the best that there is in the music business. I can't wait for his next CD."
5,Soulful Music Found Here!,"Tim's newest album is proof that he continues to grow and mature in the music realm. Country music at its best is found in story songs, and ""Red Ragtop"" is an excellent example. Romance and music are often entwined, as in ""She's My Kind of Rain"". Throughtout the album, Tim's music maturity shows...this is his best album yet!"
5,Tim Does It Again!,"Again Tim McGraw is back with a new Cd and this one seems better than all the rest, from the first song ""Comfort Me"" to the very last song ""Tiny Dancer"" this album is awesome! It has those slow songs we love to hear him sing and a few you can jam on! I listen to it everyday from beginning to end!"
5,Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors,I have all of Tim McGraws CD's and Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors is my favorite. I just love it that Tim chose to have the Dancehall Dr join him to make this CD. This is one of his best and I am sure it wont be the last.
1,aint to good,Ok I'll admit it I bought this album for the picture on the cover of the cd and that was a BIG mistake. Tim looks good and thats where it ends. He has an ordinary voice and ordinary songs and it aint even country. He is nothin but an over hyped product of mainstream nashville and thats it. My advice is only to buy this cd for the picture on the cover cause he shore does look good.
5,Tim McGraw & DanceHall Doctors review by faithhillnut,"I think this CD is Tim's best work yet!! It seems like he is more in tune with the emotions of these songs then ever before! I think it is great that he was finally able to use the band on a record. Tim also sounds like he's more relaxed. I love that Tim was able to make the music the way he wanted, not going by Nashville's standards. I love this CD, and hope that he'll continue to make records this way!!"
4,Another Great One From Tim,"Tim has out done him self AGAIN!! With each CD it just gets better and better. ""Tickin' Away"", ""Red Ragtop"", and ""Who Are They"" are just a small sampling of the GREAT songs on this CD!"
5,I LOVE this CD!,"Tim McGraw gets better and better each album! His songs have a great moral and they really get down deep into my soul! I really love ""She's my kind of rain."" I sing it all the time even when I'm at school, the mall, and at the barn feeding my chicks. Tim Mcgraw is a true country singer unlike some of those whose songs have turned into more like Britney Spears then the true country style. I absolutely love Tim McGraw, I can't till he comes to Rodeo this year and I can hear all his songs live! I really encourage all of y'all to buy this album, it is worth every penny!!!!From Tim's biggest Texan Fan!!! I love you Tim!!!"
5,Review for Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors CD,"My username is timfan for Tim's I-SquadTim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors have outdone themselves this time. They have done a fabulous job on this CD. It sounds like they have put all they are worth in this CD. The lyrics and the overall sounds of each song is like Tim is singing straight from the heart. He puts his emotion and passion into his songs.He is an astounding entertainer, performer and overall superstar. We have seen him in concert 3 times. He just keeps getting better and better!Thanks from some of your fans from Canada! We love you Tim! Happy New Year to you and your family."
5,Just keeps getting better!,"I am a huge Tim McGraw fan. I have each of his cd's, and love everyone. I wonder each time how he is able to outdo the last. This one is incredible, it has so much feeling and emotion in it. I love the fact that he included his band in the process. The song ""Red Rag Top"" is awesome. It tells a story of youth that I think many of us can relate too. I love the remake of ""Tiny Dancer"", and the song ""Thats why God made Mexico"" is my favorite on the cd. He just keeps getting better and better, and cant wait to hear him perform these song live next month. Tim is truly an incredible and soulful singer."
5,Dance Hall Doctors Rock,"Tim McGraw and The Dance Hall Doctors is one of his best. They sound good in person, so it was only a matter of time they would do a record together. The CD has no limits. Tim sounds great as well as the Doctors. He was not worried about bad press with the song Red Rag Top. Tim and the Dance Hall Doctors went all out for this CD and sound great1"
5,One word---Awesome!,"This is Tim's best work yet...I know he will top it though. The songs are such a variety that you don't get board. Their are the romantic then into the toe tapping and then the ones you want to dance to. That's why God made Mexico, is the perfect song to just get away. Watch the Wind Blow By, is perfect when you are in that giddy, I love somebody, mood. A Real Good Man is one of the greatest songs on this CD. I have already played this CD to death. Great Jobs guys...keep up the good work~!!!"
3,Don't Scratch this one!,"More complex than the first, several great, beautiful tunes, the old Shames still at their best!"
1,TERRIBLE SOFTWARE,"You're better off paying the extra $50 and buying a half-decent DVD burner. I saw this product in Best Buy and it looked pretty good, but boy, was I wrong. Whenever I try to copy a DVD an error message comes up. As a matter of fact, I'm uninstalling it as I write this review. Do not buy this product."
1,depends,"a strange, STRANGE piece of software that I would prob not buy if I were you, nevertheless it did rip a dvd in about 10 min, though i cannot watch it without burning it to a dvd or cd."
5,Punk with a soul.,"So good you'll cry. Mia Zapata's voice, the music...unbelievable. The world may have lost Mia Zapata, but at least we still have the music. Start with ""Cut my skin it makes me human""...you won't recover. You're gonna want this CD."
1,The Cloud of Unknowing,The Cloud of Unknowing was written using Old English words and long complicated sentences which made it extremely difficult for me to understand. If you are a scholar of this style of writing I guess it would be helpful. It definitely was not the book for me. I only bought it because of reading Caroline Myss' book which made many references to it. Hopefully someone else may be able to make some sense of it.
3,nice,good reflection. Needs a lot of reflection. Cannot just read like a regular book. Need to get deeper into yourself
1,What a sad piece of work!,"It's sad when a has-been journalist grabs a story that he hopes will attract nationwide attention, and he ends up publishing his book through an obscure imprint, generating virtually no interest except from a few close friends (who perhaps may feel sufficiently obligated to write reviews ... the ""five star"" ratings are themselves a giveaway, since it is inconceivable that anyone could rate this pathetic book as ""excellent."")As for the story: Based on utterly half-baked knowledge of its subject matter, deriving its plot from bad Hollywood cliches."
4,Brain Freeze,"Another excellent book by Polidoro. I would have given it five stars except that I don't understand all the medical terminology. The book has held my attention from the onset. I found it to be very credible and must believe that where so many people are opting for such a process that it is probably not too far from taking place somewhere in the distant future. If not, it is a hell of a money-maker for these cryonics people. I definitely recommend it!"
5,Truth at it's best!,"If the CHURCH would prayerfully read and apply all the truth in all three volumes of Race Religion & Racism, we would live in a world filled with more love and peace."
2,"Vampires, Bondage and S&M","Sips of Blood is a meandering story of vampires, blood worship, bondage, and sadism. I found it rather superficial and lacking substance. The characters, having no real believable personality, also added very little to the story. Even the infamous Marquis de Sade, of who this book revolves around is seen as little more than an everyday man with a secret life dealing with torture, pain, and brutality. Little if any of the psychological aspects of his mind and thought process are dealt with.For those looking for an easy reading book dealing with porn, bondage, and a thirst for blood, then you probably will enjoy the book. However, if you expect something more substantial than superficial flash and shock, if you want to get into the minds, hearts, and souls of people and their behaviors, then you won't be satisfied."
2,I wanted to like it..,I picked this little book up at a thrift store this past weekend. I wanted to like it and the premise was great! The Marquis De Sade as a vampire! Great concept! It was a major disappointment to find that it just really did not live up to expectation! The story jumps around so much for the first half of the novel I couldn't figure out who the characters were or how they fit together. As the plot thickened it started to make some sense but then it just jumped a few sharks too many for me.The best part of the book for me was the quotes from the Marquis De Sade's novels that start each chapter and I actually liked some of the S&M; scenes. The book was really sub par for me. I paid around $.15 for it and I feel like I overpaid. I really wanted to like this book - all the elements were there - and then it just didn't work.
3,A surprising shock,"I found this book interesting in a very individual manner. The plot was somewhat weak leaving the reader yearning for more vampire aspects instead of S&M. The new view of the Marquis de Sade was worth reading. But in my view,this book sends you running back to the staples of vampire literature like Bram Stroker's Dracula and Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles."
4,that's it?,"I was drawn in by the characters and plot, but the ending left me cold... It came to it's conclusion too suddenly for my tastes, I thought there would be a few more pages to it."
2,Fascinating opportunity squandered!,"This premise really had promise. The concept of the Marquis de Sade being ""alive"", forever walking the earth, was chilling and horrifying. Which crimes would he commit in this modern time? What would his view of our society be? However, the author didn't explore this fascinating aspect of the story. Instead, we were treated to some kinda weak (and not at all sexy) S & M that provided little insight into the characters and that didn't seem to DRIVE the story as much as BE the story. This wasn't enough to keep me riveted. I finished it, but the book is already in the ""to be donated"" pile. A disappointment."
3,"Sex, Love and Vampires",Flesh and blood mix in this explicit tale of vampires and their victems. I expected an historical novel of vampires much like the Saint Germain and Dracula's wives series written by Chelsea Quinn Yarbo instead I found a moderm story filled with disfunctional humans and wickedly sensual vampires. Louis Sade is what you would expect vicious and controling. His mother in law is straight from hell and his lovely niece is so sad and lonely. She breaks your heart. The character development is the strength of this novel. The plot takes a while to come together. I would highly recommend this to adult vampire horror fans but I would not suggest it for teens.
4,Gotta Love It!,It was really great of Mitchell to use Sade as a character. it made it seem so much more realistic in terms of characters. The S&M scenes are very descritpive. I couldn't put it down! I read for hours on end without noticing the time. I've had friends borrow this book and they agree it is VERY interesting. The novel is very well-pieced together and it flows like bubbly champagne!
2,some mistake or misunderstanding?,"Well:I not so happy because I ordered this book in Spanish,following an ad I saw in your site.The book arrived in English.I put a complain,asking for the Spanish version,and I received the book ,English version again!!!I have to ask for a label to send it back.Actually,were two different Jorge Luis Borges's books.Thanks"
3,Do the crossword puzzles,"Dry as a ""good read"", it's got the basics down pretty well, but it could have been better organized. I found the crossword puzzles at the end of each chapter a very good review, and more fun than flash cards. Buy it if you must; I'm keeping mine for reference."
5,Great book,Priceless for learning veterinary terminology. I bought this book many years ago before I went to veterinary school & it is a great way to learn the proper terminology--every RVT should have this book mastered...
2,Good for about 3-4 years,"Good muffler, but it only will last 3-4 years. I've gone through a couple on my Jeep Grand Cherokee. Walker pipes last less (about 2-3 years)."
2,Suzuki Delux AS-SC Alto Sax Outfit,Great packaging- Impressive case- Impressive looking-but substandard quality. It simply does not play in tune. Suzkuki needs to works on the intonation of this model. I feel like my $ is used for Fluff instead ofquality control and design.Bottom Line- stay away
4,Very good sound and quality,"I purchased this saxophone for my son. It has been 4 months now, he is learning and playing. The teacher said it is a good choice for beginners and makes of it a very good deal for quality/price.The instrument itself is very pretty, sound is very good and clear (and loud too!). You will need however to buy a better cleaning swab.I definitely recommend it. Very good price (you can find cheaper ones, but the quality is really poor compare to this Suzuki Saxo). I think it is perfect for beginners or for people not sure of which instrument they want to learn."
3,VM's breakthrough CD,"On this CD, VM improved vastly on their lackluster debut, ""the new shape,"" in part by replacing singers Robert Janson and Robert Amirian with Anita Lipnicka on some songs. (NOTE: Edyta Bartosiewicz does NOT sing on this CD. Anita L does.) ""Zanim Zrozumiesz"" is the reason to own this one. The song dominated Polish radio for the better part of a year. Anita appeared again on VM's ""Elf"" which is by far their best CD. After that, she went solo, and anyone who likes her singing with VM must hear her solo material."
5,Great Product,"This is a great product. I have had several catpads over the years and have left them behind at jobs, animals have chewed the cords, and technology has changed the connection with the incarnation of the usb cord (I have never replaced them because of product failure). This one is my favorite because of the large screen pad. I have not used the hot buttons - but I hope to. I will buy the product again and highly recommend it."
3,USB Touchpad,Needed to download drivers since it does not work well as a plug and play device. Preferred the old versions with the serial connector that were better.
4,What a Charge!!,Its Great to have a batery that will last longer than a day. I love having the product.
5,Wisdom Going Forth From Jerusalem,"This book is must reading for anyone intereted in the political process as well anyone interested in the Bible. Author Yoram Hazony demonstrates not only excellent research skills and a good understanding of history but also a logical, clear-thinking mind combined with a healthy dose of common sense (which, as Voltaire once said, is not all that common).Having also read Mr. Hazony's other book, The Jewish State, I can only conclude the State of Israel is fortunate to have people with his degree of wisdom. In fact, I believe he would make an excellent prime minister."
5,Product works,"This product will not help you detect a yeast infection because yeast infections are not caused by bacteria instead its considered a fungus. This will help you detect if you have a bacteria infection which most vaginal infections are bacterial. When i used it, it turned color indicating an infection, I followed the results up by going to my OBGYN and confirmed i had BV, but i didn't have a yeast infection. I would say this product works, but if you believe you have a yeast infection contact your doctor instead of purchasing this product. Also just because it does not turn color means your in the clear, Always follow up suspicions with a doctor visit!"
1,Diasppointed,"I am not saying the music is bad or the quality is lacking, because it is not. If you are looking for traditional music played in the traditional way, then this CD is not for you. It is like listening to everyone's interpretation when they sing the ""Star Spangled Banner"". There is no need to jazz things up that were not written to be. The titles are old but the variations on the score have a lot to be desired if you wanted to hear these songs played the way they were meant to be played."
5,An exhilarating romp with the Hollywood greats,"Bob Sidney's book is refreshingly direct - he tells stories about all the great Hollywood stars he has worked with over the years - Frank Sinatra, Debbie Reynolds, Judy Garland, Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and many more. They are insider's stories which haven't been told before.Bob was primarily a choreographer, but also a writer and director - and sometime performer - and his career spanned the 40s to the 70s, working in film and TV, Broadway and night-clubs. His stories are light, personal, sometimes funny and sometimes poignant - always entertaining.It's a great book to dip into, to pick up and put down, and be sorry when you've finished. Not many people have the opportunity to have lead such an extraordinary life as Mr Sidney, who also had an extraordinary career.... this book shares his experiences, which are fascinating and amusing."
5,Very Simple - a great product,"This alarm clock is great (simple, inexpensive, functional) for someone who does not need a radio as part of the alarm clock. The bright red display is easily seen, it's simple to operate, and has a battery backup."
2,It will wake you up!,"I really liked the size and look of this clock, and that the display was red so it wasn't like a nightlight. But it has a horrible noise of an alarm, and it is loud. There is no way to turn down the volume. I suppose if you are not addicted to hitting the snooze button, it might be more tolerable. But for me, waking up to this alarm was like waking up to a fire alarm. It got moved into the guest bedroom."
5,Sherry's Purchase,"My husband wanted a clock just like his old one. Found one, bought it and he loves it. Big numbers and it wakes him up. What else could you ask for."
1,Tastes like medicine,"I bought the peach flavored tea, because I'm a huge fan of the passion fruit one. I tried it unsweetened and sweetened. I couldn't find a way to make this drinkable. Either way, it was awful! It tasted like some awful medicine. I threw the rest of the pitcher and box away. This was a waste of my money."
1,Ick,"I have a deep and abiding love for almost all of the China Mist iced teas. But, this peach tea has a dreadful, medicinal taste to it that is just awful. I am loathe to throw things out just because they aren't my favorite, but this tea was virtually undrinkable. I poured the entire pitcher down the drain. Get the orange blossom ginger or the blackberry jasmine tea instead. You'll thank me, I promise."
5,A Must-Have for long trips in the car,"We bought this for a 13-hour trip, along with a few other cd's. Unfortunately, of the 6-8 CD's we bought, only 2-3 made the listen to again list.This tops the liste. We listened to this over and over again, without getting bored. My husband and I laughed as much as our 4 and 6-year-old did. Mrs. Ammons is a favorite. Also, my son liked the Battle of the Mad Scientist so much that he is determined to get the neighborhood kids together to put on a similar play. He goes around using the same words from the CD---""no offense..."", and ""I'm wuined"".I would not hesitate to recommend this to any and everyone with or without kids.I am now looking at more Bill Harley CD's to entertain us on our next 13-hour trip."
2,Problematic messages in 2 selections.,"One quick caveat: our CD was damaged, so we only heard part of Battle of the Mad Scientists, which seemed ok but not great. I recommend AGAINST two of the remaining three selections: The Great Sled Race and Mrs. Ammons and the Boys' Room. They do not have positive messages for young listeners. The escapades of the boys in those two stories are not something I would want to encourage my son to copy."
3,"Good, but a little too old for preschoolers","We got this CD because we loved another of Bill Harley's cds so much in my preschool class. But, this CD is a little over their heads- probably great for 6 or 7 year olds, but not catching the ear of the 4 and 5 year olds that I know."
4,Just a nice sounding voice ...,"I first stumbled on clips of the voice of Frances Black from a DVD by her sister Mary Black, whose talents I have long admired.Frances, in talent, certainly equals the talents of her sister, what a nice sounding set of vocal chords.This CD is lively at times, and soft at other times.Like the entire Black Family, a real talent.Would love to have more of her music, a real talented lady is Frances Black."
5,For the budding scientist . . .,"Jim Weiss is an extraordinary storyteller who brings to life the process of scientific inquiry and discovery. My six year old son was so entranced by these stories of Archimedes, Brahe, Kepler, and Galileo he asked if he could go back out to the car to listen to the tape again. Worth listening to again and again."
2,"Badly written, nice tidbits","If ever a book screamed for an editor with a big red pen, this is it. Look up prolix, this is what you'll find pictured. It may also be the most redundantly written book I have ever read -- there are essentially three or four points, and they are repeated with small variation several times a paragraph, a page, a chapter -- AAAARGGHHH! Never elaborated, never intensively critiqued, never actually contrasted to how it's done elsewhere -- just restated with a big handful of superlative modifiers.BUT - I'm about to finish the darn book, and have persisted because there are a number of great, if undeveloped, anecdotes and people, some of them brand new to me, although many are drawn from other books. These tidbits are to the text like raisins are to bran cereal: the only things that make it digestible."
2,Melodramatic puff piece with some interesting nuggets,"This book reads as if it were written as a ""puff piece"" by the internal public relations department of the groups covered in the book. The writing style is way over the top melodramatic and would be embarrassing for a real journalist or serious historian. It is an unsophisticated portrayal of ""Unit 8200"" and other parts of Israeli intelligence and how certain high tech businesses spun off via members of Unit 8200. There are the nuggets of the book that could've been written and if you can get past the unsophisticated, melodramatic, and cheerleading prose then this book might interest you."
3,Education and Business...and successuful,Recommend for anyone interested in a better understanding of the education (selective)and the successfull in Israel (a small country with many successful in the technology)...To read... two o three times.... :) I'm in the second.... :-)
5,Demystifying espionage,"Stacy Perman is one of a rare breed: a great writer, but even better, a great storyteller. She makes the world of Israeli espionage interesting, engaging and relevant, even to this would-be cynic. The jacket says this is her first book, but I can't quite believe that. She has the investigative instincts of a seasoned entrepreneurial journalist coupled with an easy-to-understand writing style that makes this somewhat esoteric subject matter understandable. Can't wait for the second book!"
1,I wonder how many crayons it took to write this book...,"This is a great book for the Michael Moore crowd. If you just want to hear what you want to hear and don't care about things like facts and proof, you'll love it, if you can read it.A fictional story presented with an attitude that it's all true, it reads like a long Yahoo message board post. It would be laughable if weren't for the fact that so many people are chomping at the bit to believe every word of it, as this review section makes obvious.Conspiracy theorists aside, it isn't even well written enough to make a good fictional story. If you live in reality, pass on this one."
1,TOTAL GARBAGE!Buy something else.,"This is going to sound funny coming from a life -long democrat, but I found this book to be so devoid of reality,it doesnt make any sense to any one with more then a kindergarten reading level.The author,besides being ignorant of English grammer rules (like adding commas), goes off on wild tangents that have absolutley no basis in fact...."
1,Don't Bother,"The book is trying to talk about very enlightened thinking using many examples of works from contemporary culture, especially music from the likes of the Beatles, Sting and Jethro Tull to name a few. However, he never quotes any of the music lyrics within the book, just says they are very profound. He also mentions a number of books and poems, again, not letting us read what he is referring to. We are left to go find these references ourselves if we want to know what the heck he is talking about. Very frustrating--I tried to do this for the first chapter or so and gave up. Additionally, this was written for about a sixth grade reading level. Boring. Don't bother."
3,Neutral,So far I have found no real effect good or bad from taking this supplement I guess this is as good as any other brand as there seems to be little evidence it does much good. Price is okay and delivery adequate
1,"Nice, but with problems","I ordered 4 chairs, and 2 out of 4 were chipped in the box. Once assembled we noticed that the paint was rubbed off from place to place, and one chair has a shorter leg..so it wobles. The matching table had problems, so it had to be sent back. Seller had poor customer service; we waited 30 minutes on hold for a manager, since we asked for shipping charges to be refunded; manager never picked up, and noone checked back with us while we were on hold, so we hung up. I still have a box with chairs in my living room that has not been picked up."
5,Reuniting Economy and Ecology in Sustainable Development,This is a book that belongs in every thinking-person's library. Clear and elegant writing in addition to the critical topic makes this a book to give all your friends!
4,Gargoyles remembered.,"Reviewing the Day of the Triffids found a Cheezy move section reviewing this section found two film from my past, I remember staying up until 12 midnight to watch the tv program the midnight hour and seeing those two movies, Wow totally forget about them. The is the way 'spook' movies should be made. Bill"
1,unhappy,"This merchandise was processed through Amazon for a company called Beles or Beals Florida. Long story short; ITEM NEVER CAME. It took 6 phone calls over two months to finally receive a refund. The communication between Amazon and this company is poor. This problem was accentuated by the fact that several representatives from the mug company did not fully understand their own return policy. They were friendly to talk to, but this was a big pain in the neck."
1,THAT'S WHY THERE ARE WARS,"That's why there are wars: the men at command, who gives the bloody orders, always find someone to carry on these orders with maximum effort. Arthur Harris was this guy, ruthlessly obeying the directives to Bomber Command during WW II, and enjoying every piece of his tasks (which was destroy German cities). A good book."
4,Relook time at Mr Brubeck's experiments,"When I first encountered the Brubeck Quartet I could not get enough of the straight ahead jazz of these four, and did not venture beyond TIME OUT. I missed out on some fine albums as a consequence. This is my first taste of the remainder and these other four are worthy editions to own. Very well recorded, with quite good definition of Mr Wright's bass. Something of a bargain. An excellent companion to Mr Brubeck's own selection of his music on TIME SIGNATURES."
4,Why do so many Brubeck sets include Time Out?,"Why do so many Brubeck sets include ""Time Out"". Don't the music publishers realise that Federal Law mandated that all college freshmen had a copy of this album in their campus introductory package through September of 1992. It is SO redundant!"
2,A real disappointment,I bought this for an older friend who found her print Bible too heavy to handle comfortably. It was small and the keyboard hard to use. The screen was dark and difficult to read. The only redeeming feature was that it was user-friendly in terms of being able to find scripture.
3,"Handy, but small","I ordered this to keep in my purse for quick scripture reference. I am prone to knowing a verse verbatim and not being able to locate it quickly! So, this helps.The keys are small and the LCD screen is narrow - I wouldn't take this anywhere and expect to read a large portion - or even a chapter - of Scripture, but for quick word or verse look-up, it's handy.A little expensive, but I recommend it."
3,Good But Eats Batteries Like Crazy,"I still like this unit. It's good for on-the-go situations and looking up things while traveling like on a plane but...Like I said, it eats batteries like crazy and they are not cheap either! It became an ongoing budget to buy bulk packs of batteries for this thing. Also, the instructions tell you that, if you only remove and replace one battery at a time, then you won't lose your bookmarks. Well, this is simply not true. No matter what you do and no matter how careful, you always lose the saved passwords, files, and bookmarks. I'm pretty that sin of fibbing thing is in there somewhere too."
3,Good Item To Have But.....,"Since I have had this electronic bible, which has only been a month, it fronze up on me twice. The reset button didn't work so the only way I could clear the screen was to take the batteries out and put them back in again."
5,electronic bible,"I purchased this item for a friend for his ordination ceremony. He was pleasently surprised ! Something he always wanted but neglected to buy. He loves it . So easy to use, compact and fast. Takes it everywhere and says it is more convenienct than carrying a heavy bulky Bible. Thanks for the quality."
1,"Terrible, such a lack of talent.","After hearing this album, my ears needed to be checked. I've heard better songs in elevators. The only reason she is 'famous' is because of Eamons song, no other reason. Even so that song, 'F.U.R.B' is terrible, lyrics are just strung together to keep a rhyme going, its like a child trying to write poetry. The only thing she possesses is some writing skill, one or two of the tracks she didnt write are good in so far as their meaning, tune and lyrics however Frankee's vocals are rotten and she needs to keep her mouth shut. I really do not recommend this to anybody. Better off jamming in a lift!"
3,Frankee,At first I wasn't really into this girl but somehow some of her songs have grown on me.'I Told You So'-is a very nice song that you can almost tell that Mariah Carey was an influence on this girl.'Don't Be Mad'-very edgy and angry.'How You Do'-Great dance song. I see this song being played in nightclubs. Very Summery.'Hell No'-Again another edgy song with angry lyrics.There are a couple of songs that are a bit weak on the album but overall it's a pretty ok debut album.
1,......how about just the bad and the ugly,"Total rubbish, gonna go on e-bay or trademe to sell it, I can't believe I spent money on this rubbish. But truthfully she has an ok voice, I'll give her that but the songs, the lyrics, the music suck. And the whole Eamon/Frankee fued is ridiculous way for way to get fame."
1,Trying To Steal Someone Else's Fame,"This album does nothing for me. The only song that is maybe ok is ""I Told You So"". Her voice sounds like it breaks throughout the album and getting fame from someone else(Eamon) is not cool."
1,O DEAR,IS THIS ALBUMS IS A BIGGER JOKE THAN THE STUPID EAMON/FRANKEE FU/FURB ARGUMENT!!WHEN ARE PEOPLE GONNA SEE WE AINT INTERESTED IN TRASH LIKE THIS!WHY ISNT THERE A '0' ON THE SCALE!
1,It needs 0 stars and thats to all too!,"She thinks she got it going on by getting the last word. Let me explain on how she's a bigger loser compaired to Eamon. She has no promotion I don't see her music video, she stole Eamon's back ground music to play in one of her songs instead of being original, she will agree to sign a record deal with a studio to say the same stuff about a man like Eamon did to his ex and Frankee is not his ex, she admitted to giving a guy head how trashy is that."
1,FRANKEE IS WACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Frankee is WACK!!!!!! how you gonnacome out w/ a song that has your exs beats & the melody. puregarbage. i saw her video on yahoo music launch and it was wack. Itlooks like they only spent about $100,000 maybe thats just for theequipment. Anyway she's a total fake, she can't sing, and she's justwack. Now Eamon, is the genius. He's cute, he can sing and he hadthe hit before her. I was reading her website and in her bio itmentioned that she was a worldwide hit before F.U.R.B. Bull freakingcrap!!!!!!!! She's a total loser.READ CAREFULLY:DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUMDO NOT BUY THIS ALBUMDO NOT BUY THIS ALBUMDO NOT BUY THIS ALBUMDO NOT BUY THIS ALBUMDO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM"
5,Still the best book on the subject by far,"Yes, there are no color illustrations, and yes, the prose is dense, but if you would like to read what is probably the most brilliant book ever written in the history of art, this is it. Don't expect a page-turner. You may have to read it twice to understand it. I did. And it was worth it. If you are interested in Albrecht Durer, this is a must-read."
2,Looking for good reproductions? Don't get this one.,"I was immensely disappointed when I received this book. I was aware that it was an art critic book, and not all focused on the actual works of Dürer, but still: The reproductions are poor excuses for illustrations. I don't think I've ever seen worse. This is a book for people who are interested in Panofsky's theories, not mainly interested in making up their own minds."
5,does what it;s supposed to do!,"What can you say? It does it's job and doesn't twist the line or screw up. It's a good design in this regard. It is also covered and doesn""t scar the boat when it hits. I like it."
3,meade instruments telestar ng-60 refracting telescope,"I had to put this away temporarily until I could find a larger surface folding table to get it up high enough I could work it. I tried getting on my knees to look through it, but then, at 80, my back gives me a problem. I haven't been able to find a folding square coffee table that is large enogh to sit the telescope safely on it. I plan to get a piece of plywood and lay it on the coffee table, but just haven't had the time. I think it is a quality product but I'm no expert. I get the moon on it, but can't hold it still unless I can get it on a high-enough surface."
3,Reconciles science class with art school,"The most useful thing I found in this book is that it reconciles what I learned in school about light and color with what I learned from art technique books about color mixing and the behavior of pigments. I didn't see much else new in the book, but this one bit of information has made color mixing (and other color theories/systems) a lot more sensible to me.Another thing that Michael Wilcox has done (in his Guide to Watercolor Paints) is pointed out the difference between paints made with a single pigment ingredient and paints made with a mixture of pigments. This has also simplified color-mixing for me...."
2,The Second Coming it ain't,"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. If you are brand new to color mixing this book will be helpful, if only to tell you it isn't necessary to buy all the colors each art instructor recommends. However, if you have been painting any time at all, you know that you need at least a 6 primary system as opposed to a 3 primary system. From there, with a few ""earth"" colors you can mix whatever color you want. The color mixing part of the book is great for that, however, a large part of the the book is spent ""proving"" that the 3 primary system is wrong. Who cares? As long as a system works I don't care if it is ""subtractive"" or ""additive""."
5,a good technical resource,"It is, I suppose, a reference book that every artist should possess and keep handy at all times. It is a book that I return to time and time again for assistance."
5,Must-have book for all artists!,I have taught Color & Color Theory for 20 years and this book is great. It changed my approach to teaching color mixing. My students leave my class well-prepared to mix any color they desire.
2,18th century color theory,"this book gets more interest for its paradoxical (and inaccurate) title than for its contents, which are straight out of 18th century color theory and painting practice. for a review of this book and links to background materials, google ""wilcox handprint"" and click the first few links. i should add that some of the positive reviews posted here appear verbatim at the wilcox ""school of colour"" website and are therefore just viral marketing.the quiller book ""color choices"" and the hilary page book ""color right from the start"" are excellent resources. this book is heavy on simplification, routine, and computer generated color samples."
2,Nothing new here.,"I'm not sure what all the hype is about this book. The color bias wheel is nothing new. If you already know that you need a warm and cool red in your pallette, then spend your $$$ on another book.I had hoped to see more in depth info on the work done by Birren, Itten or Munsell. I found the colored examples to be poorly printed resulting in the purple always looking brown. How helpful is that? There were no examples of artwork to show the benefits of using a color biased pallette which made it a really boring read. Wilcox goes on way too much about the evils of the 3 color primary system and I'm not sure I buy his theory that a PURE blue and a PURE yellow would make a black.Color Choices by Stephen Quiller is a much better book. Stephen note only understands color, he knows what to do with it."
4,A color reference for the serious artist,"This book's central lesson is: ""Color mixing should be a thinking process based on knowledge."" This book discusses the physics of color and light. It has pages and pages devoted to the properties of various colors, and what will happen when you mix Color A and Color B. I just wish this were a lightweight paperback so I could throw it in my painting kit."
2,"Nothing new, much that's not right",The three-primary theory that Wilcox maligns in the introduction has been discredited for a hundred years. But the system he expouses has been around even longer. Much of the theory in the book is simply wrong.http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/book3.html#wilcox
1,Confusing and Useless,"This is a terrible book. I got the video of it too and it was unwatchable. His ideas are mixed up, he thinks colors are warm or cool without realizing any color can be made to look warm or cool. This book does not help anyone learn to paint, or to understand what color is or how it relates to art.Complete waste of money. If I could get my money back I would."
4,Revolutionary Clarification on Color Mixing,"Mr. Wilcox clears up centuries of hit and miss color mixing techniques. Before the theories presented in this work, learning how to mix colors used to be trial and error over and over again until memorized, usually just as Social Security kicked in. The text covers the basics of how light and color work together. Wilcox takes the next logical step and combines those principls with basic color-wheel theory and in doing so answers many questions that baffle beging painters and colorists in general. More illustrations of completed works utilizing these ideas would have made the book easier to warm up to but the concepts are just as effective nonetheless."
5,Makes color mixing cristal clear,"This book is great. As a hobby, I started painting a little over a year ago. However, after investing hundreds of hours and dollars, I was on the verge of giving up painting all together because of the frustration resulting from failing to mix colors accurately, wasting time, money and going nowhere. In his book, Mr. Wilcox, starting from the color pigment level, clearly explains to us the entire color mixing process with thousands of examples backed by illustrated scientific information, and takes out the guess work, thus allowing the artist to concentrate on the composition. After reading this book, my colors are now a hundred percent accurate with colors ending up on canvas rather than in the trash. The only critisism I may have is his continuous repitition of the evils and shortcomings of traditional color-mixing theory. Other than that, thank you Mr. Wilcox for bringing back the joy of painting."
5,Good stuff!!!,"I believe that this is a seminal work in the history of art. Michael Wilcox explores the physics of color mixing, and why it is that if you mix blue and yellow, you might not get green. Artists buy ten blues and ten greens, and STILL don't get the hue they want. If you want to understand WHY, BUY THIS BOOK!A true classic!"
2,Book is misleading,"The photos in the book are mostly made with vintage ribbons from the 20' or 30's. Instructions are lacking. Example: Book tells you to use 1"" ribbon but does not say what kind. I felt it was misleading. Why not show photos of flowers made with ribbon that is readily available. All book says is not to use cheap ribbon. What does that mean? So why have a book with photos of flowers you can't make."
2,Not a informative book,This book is hit and miss. It does not go into ribbon work very well. Not for a beginner or an experienced ribbon master. It needs to be more comprehensive and in detail. It is lacking sorely in content. It was literally a waste of time and money.
5,I Love Sewing,This book is wonderful--I have finished my jacket with the ruching trim included in this book --it was easy to follow and I plan on doing other features in the book iit is a very special book for sewers.
5,Techniques for Making Ribbon Flowers and Trimmings,BEAUTIFUL book...worth having just to look at the pictures. BUT the flowers appear to be more difficult to make than I expected.
4,His WHOLE HEAD!!!!,"If you don't recognize this phrase, you need to watch this movie. I can only assume that being brothers helped the interaction between Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez's characters, because they make the movie work with great comedy. Don't bother watching it for the plot, but if you need to laugh hard, check this movie out!"
4,laughed until we couldn't breathe,A tasteless movie that's so funny we laughed until we couldn't breathe. You'll never look at men on bicycles the same way again.
4,"Corded screwdriver works well, especially on drywall","My drywall projects grew in scope as I gained experience, so I decided to invest in a screwgun. I have installed drywall in a garage and several rooms. I bought the DW 276 because I might also use this for decking or flooring. This tool works great on drywall, rapidly and consistently driving screws to the proper depth. I have placed plywood subflooring with this tool and have found that the ""feel"" of this application was different from drywall, but the tool was good for this application as well."
4,a very different perspective,"this book outlines the state-formation of south africa, brazil and the united states, and links those state-formation practices by race and racism. i recommend!"
2,Only one bud works the left one,I have another pair of these that are great . Threse are a manufacture defect I am returning them for a replacement of the same earbudsN
4,Good for average use,"By that I mean, they are good enough but by no means does the quality impress. I typically just watch movies on my computer with them."
4,Good Good Good!,"Very good for the price, I would recommend you buy this if you need good working headphones for a cheap price!!"
4,Can't complain for the money,"Really, you want fabulous bass, great treble and midrange for 6 bucks? I do too, but come on--I also want a brand new sports car for under 5 Grand. These phones are great for the money. They're not the best I've had but the best I've had cost 5 times as much. I really only use these to fall asleep with a cheap mp3 player so I bought 2 pairs because I toss and turn a lot and assume I'll break them fairly quickly. I need the volume control because my player is too loud even turned down as low as it can go. I'm pleased with these and if they only last a month, I'll feel I've gotten my money's worth."
2,poor product,"Sound quality is bad and they do not fit in my ear, they just fall right out as soon as I move. The adjustable volume control can be useful when using with your laptop when ads can be at extremely high volume and you need to lower it super quick. For that reason I gave it two stars but headphones are useless because I need to hold them in my ear or stay very still once they're in. Don't buy these, there are better ones for just as cheap."
4,Its pretty good for the price.,"I bought this pair of headphones cause I was sick of all the good/expensive pairs breaking. The last four times that I've got a 60/70$ headphones, they've all lasted me about 3-4 months. I just decided that I'm going to buy really cheap headphones until I can save up enough for a top notch one that has a reputation of not break. These headphones are actually pretty nice too. They re a lot more comfortable than the usual Ipod headphones. They also have a pretty good sound to them. I also like the volume control knob they have on the wire."
4,Not bad,The sound is crap but these are far more comfortable than your standard earbuds and are surprisingly sturdy. Get a low-end Skullcandy pair of buds for better sound.
5,Excellent!,I bought this for my grandson and they work wonderful. There is a volume control on the earphones which is a great feature. I would recommend this item.
1,Terrible sound quality,"I'm no audiophile but even to me these headphones have terrible sound reproduction. Get the other Coby's on Amazon if you want something cheap, surprisingly better sound reproduction -- keep in mind that they'll break relatively easily."
5,Worth the money,"These earphones are just as loud as any overly priced ipod earphones and are even better. They have the best bass with clear voices so you dont just hear a thrashing noise with barely any singing in the background,also one important thing I almost forgot was that they are LOUD.Now sound volume is an important factor for people who go through busy streets,bus and train passagers, or even joggers(sweat resistant) who want to block out the outside noises from disturbing them.It completly closes you in to only your music and can even be hard to realize when someone is calling you.I was suprised to get such a great pair of earphones for such a cheap price. I am really pleased with them and if you buy them you definetly will too."
3,Comfort: 10. Sound: About a 4.,"Yep, they're comfy, all right--fit nicely in the ear, block off ambient noise, nice and light. But the sound reproduction... enh, not so much. I'm used to top-quality earbuds and lightweight headphones, and these just sound like an old AM transistor radio. I'll wear 'em for yard work, for the comfort, but if you're expecting really crisp, broad-spectrum audio performance from a pair of earbuds, it's a good idea to look elsewhere."
1,Not what I had hoped for,"I bought these for the comfort and the convenience of having the volume control handy. Although they are comfortable, the sound quality was extremely disappointing. There were instruments in my music that I couldn't even hear when compared with my original iPod earphones. I recommend you keep looking if you like good sound."
3,there ok,there no better than the ones that came with the unit i got . there ok but i have better ones for about the same price.
1,These earphones couldn't fit my ears,"It's cheap, and the function is nice to adjust the volume; however, these earphones can't fit my ears at all, i can't use them; even though I don't move, they still slid from my ears right away!Coby CVE91BLK Isolation Stereo Earphones with Volume Control, Black"
2,Not Good,Sorry to say i wasn't happy. The sound is good but the volume control doesn't last. You get more volume out of one side while the other side is very low. Worked good for about a month.
3,They are ok.,They lack bass and quality. They are crisp to a degree. But you'd be better off buying a different pair.
5,Broke,Great earphones for a great price! I bought this as a gift for my cousin and she really loves it!
2,"Not Good, No Bass, CVE31 or Coby Jammerz r better","Coby makes good sounding earbuds... the CVE31 or the Jammerz anyway. I purchased these in February 2012. I bought them because I have numerous pairs of the CVE31's and the Jammerz and they sound great. I share them with my boys and anyone who needs a new pair of headphones. They're so inexpensive a person can easily do that. I bought these because I like the volume button on the cord but that's where the plus for them ends.I thought something was wrong with either my ears or the device. Nope. It's the CVE91's. They really suck as far as the sound goes. I did multiple switcharoo tests with different devices in comparison to the CVE31's and the Jammerz. The 31's and J's won every time with any device. Glad I only bought one pair of these. I'm serious about my music and the headphones or earbuds must work acceptable to me and these just didn't.No dis to those that they do work for, we all have different taste's."
3,pretty ok,these in ear buds a good at best .. sound quality is decent just not alot of Low End.. in line volume control is handy .. for the price it's a good buy
1,don't buy this,"crappy quality control from this company.this head phone i've received is defected,left side has a lower volume than the right side.i would recommend to spend a few bucks more to get a brand name, coby is not."
3,They are ok,The headphones are ok. i used them for 2 weeks and they broke.I do not recommend it but it was ok.
4,Earphones,"I bought these because I didn't know the MP3 player had them with them. However, these are more comfortable than the ones in the box."
3,I am not sure how much noise these cancel,"OI can still hear loud noises and the TV playing while listening to music wearing these. They do have a convenient volume switch and are comfortable. Also LOTS cheaper than other ""noise cancelling"" earphones."
4,Earbuds,"I love these earbuds. My Nanos down volume button has permantly broke. I love my nano and can not afford a new one. I decided to buy earbuds with a volume control on them. Reading the reviews helped a ton. The only difference is the treble and bass sound took a little adjusting too. Other than that, for the price and the sound and not having to invest over $100 right now, they are great!"
1,Not very Good.,"They barely stay in your ears. I couldn't even go on a walk with them not falling out every 5 seconds. The sound is average, nothing special."
4,decent headphones,Purchased these headphones a few months ago. These are good headphones at a good price. Can't beat it. Not disappointed.
1,not worth the price,Sound quality is so bad. Something you'd expect from a dollar store. I do not recommend this item. However it may work for AM radio and/or low-bitrate eBooks (though I still think the price is way too high for this quality). Included Napster trial was expired.
3,So so performance,Not a lot of highs.Low to mid.I like the ones that came with my ipod better.Wish they had not fell in the toilet. :)
4,Coby Headphones,It was a good product and I got it in a timely manner. I really like the service I got when ordering this product very much.
4,"Good sound, not comfortable","I use this every day, and like it, except that it is not comfortable in my year. When I walk it becomes loose. I suggest something that one does not have to stick inside your ear."
2,These Really are Not Very Good,"I use earbuds to listen to audio books. These earbuds make the voices sound like mush. I can understand the voices, but it is tiring to listen. I bought a pair of GoGroove earbuds at the same time, and they are 20 times better (and 3 times as expensive, which is still cheap). I don't know how music would sound with these. I will not be buying these earbuds again."
2,"If you want decent sound, pass on these","I'm not an audiophile or music snob by any means, I just wanted a pair a headphones with a volume for running. The price at Amazon was great (~$5), but I got what I payed for - not great sound. It sounds OK until you compare them to a good pair.When I tried them out, my daughter happend to be sitting next to me with her skull candy earphones. I gathered up other earphones in the house and compared them. Here is what I found: The skull candy and sony sounded great - big full sound. These Coby's sounded between fair and poor, and a no-name pair, probably from an airline, sounded poor.If you have never tried a good pair of earphones, these will probably be fine for you, but do yourself a favor and try a pair of Sony or Skull Candy."
2,Coby Isolation Stereo Earphones with Volume Control CVE91WHT,"They have bad sound quality, and the ear buds easily slip out of your ears. What makes it worse is that since the ear buds are loose, the weight of the cords itself drags on your ears so you are constantly reaching up to adjust them. This was a bad buy- go for quality, and worry about price secondarily."
2,Muffled/Muddy Sound w/Muted Bass,"I bought these earphones primarily because they have a volume control, thought that might be useful. I instantly found the sound on these earphones to be VERY poor; the sound was muddy/muffled and the base was muted. I tried these earphones on several radios and had the same effect. I also found the rubber inserts on the headphones to be a design I just don't like-frankly they aren't exactly clean when taken out of your ear and they are very flimsy. The volume control in reality wasn't worth the poor sound this product puts out, and really isn't something needed anyway. I just sent this product back, VERY unimpressed with the sound or lack thereof."
5,VERY,I ordered 3 sets of these earphones for my 2 grandchildren and myself. They arrived promptly in excellent condition. My grandchildren just love them. They play their computer games without annoying each other. They are excellent earphones! I would recommend them to everybody!
3,Volume control best feature,They are coby; the low-cost brand at all stores. But the volume control is the best feature because my mp3 player is stuck on the max volume. They were like $1.something and the shipping was HORRENDOUS at over $6 for two pair.
2,Coby Earphones,Bad sound and week bass when compared with iLuv earphones that have almost the same price.
4,One happy camper,"It is great for my use. The only problem is that the right side plays noticable louder than the left. It gets annoying after a while. The ear buds fit great, but the noise isolation is not as good as some other earbuds. The L shapped jack is great for me becuase I am really rough with my stuff and it gave it a much longer life time than other shaped jacks. This is a great earbud overall for the low price."
2,just a ok one,the earphone works just ok. But the quality of sound is quite bad. It is almost not good for any music and song.
2,you got what you paid for,"This headphone looks good, but the sound quality is really bad compare to Sony, I wouldn't recommend this headphone if you are those people who have a higher standard of sound quality"
2,low quality even for the price,"the volume control is definitely nice, but it seems to sacrifice too much. first of all these earphones can't go as high as others. Secondly AND MORE IMPORTANTLY the quality of the sound is much lower than other earphones even in the same price range. they make it sound like its being played from under a pillow or in a foam cup.i bought theCoby CVE92 Isolation Stereo Earphoneswhich were around the same price, and was much more impressed with the sound quality."
2,not worth it,even with the price so cheap these are too bulky (the solid plastic length from the bud is HORRIFIC) to fit in your ears correctly. no matter how far you 'try' to position the earphones in your ear the sound is terribly muted/muffled with no sign of treble/mid or even bass! i gave it 2 stars cos of the solid build quality. i'm still using my old senheisers & newer jvc buds. i'll never use the corbys
2,Terribad all around,"These things are the worst headphones i have ever bought. I mean i guess they might be better than the ones that come with your mp3 player. Its like listening to music transmitted through a potato then a tin can. Its useful to strangle yourself if the cheapass cord holds up. Seriously buy a decent pair for a few dollars more, its worth it. Here's my advice: Memorex earbuds like theseMemorex Stereo Earbuds works with your Ipod and MP3 player - Blackthey have perfect sound and cancel noise beautifully, plus they are cheap. Those are the greatest value headphones on the market."
1,Small Price Small sound,"Well being on a budget i thought i would give this a try,,,I went by the reviewsand was not pleased with this product,However if i look at what I paid i guess its right in line with the cost. The shipping time was great but again having a low end product show up on time didn't ease the bummer"
1,Poor Quality,This product is for people who still use 20 year old sony walkman cd's. You get what you pay for - totally rubbish!I intended to use these earphones to replace my Ipod earphones. I purchased these based on the reviews below and boy what a mistake.Sound Quality: Worse than the Ipod earphones. The music is light sounding with no base.Fitment: It didn't fit my ears snug at all. I realize fitment may vary among users.This is one of the worst products I've ever purchased.
2,Bass Lacking,"I got the Coby CV-E91's looking for a good low price set of earphones. The earpieces are soft and comfortable and the volume control is nice to have. But, if you are looking for a full sound with lots of bass, these are not for you. These earphones just don't have the richness and large bass as the original phones that came with my iriver clix."
2,Not quite what I expected,"When I saw ""with volume control"" I assumed it would be similar to the Apple volume control--push buttons to increase/decrease volume along with a center button to pause/play and hang/pick up phone calls. Well these didn't have a microphone so no pause/play button and the volume control was a wheel control. It was my own fault for not reading the description more closely, but make sure you know you're getting just a volume wheel here and no other playback controls..."
4,Great Quality,"Fast shipping. the earphone works good quality to me. While I am using, there is no annoying voice appeared, but the sound doesn't go dynamic(like stereo.) I have been using for 6 months and there is no problem shown. overall, it's a great product."
3,Not what I was hoping for,"They do fine on the noise canceling aspect, but the sound quality is a bit muffled and really just sub par. They're fine of you aren't really into hearing every nuance of a song."
2,Earphones,"The left side has never worked well and the earbuds are a little uncomfortable, but otherwise the sound control I liked being able to adjust."
3,Buy the other Coby's,For a $1 or so less the other Coby's are better. You can use these to run because the separate volume control thing bounces around and pulls the headphones out of your ear over time. The other Coby's are perfect for running. You can use these for walking and they'll probably be fine. I prefer the sound of the other Coby's as well. This didn't really increase the bass at all so don't buy them for that. If you want a quick volume control these work better than trying to control the volume using the MP3 player you have. That is the only thing I really liked. I'll use the earpieces but other than that won't be using these much.
2,"Descent sound quality, not comfortable","I found the sound quality good enough for ear buds of this price range, no complaints there. But something about their design irritates my ears and makes them itchy, and I can't use them for extended periods of time. Also they're design is a bit of a ""wax trap"", which is gross... I didn't have that problem with my previous ear buds (which were just cheapos that came with a blackberry).UPDATE: 1 month later, the right earbud quit working. Can't get any output from it."
2,Dont recomend,"Ok for starters the earphones come in two sizes. I have average ears I believe and the big size didnt fit and the small ones didnt stay in. The sound quality was poor. Yes I used them to get them warmed up, even after that tough they sound shotty. I wouldnt suggest buying them."
2,not portable,These headphones are only good if you plan on listening to your audio stationary. If you move much they will not stay in your ears.
1,negative,"these were absolutely the worst earphones i have ever had they sounded terrible, and are not what they are said to be in the description."
2,worth every penny,"The good- very low price, good volume control, angled jackThe bad- muffled sound, no highs or lowsThe ugly- neither size earbuds fit, you have to cram them into your ear to get them to stayNo thanks, can't hold a candle to plain jane ipod earbuds."
2,Horrible,"When I purchased these earphones I didn't expect much from it, but I didn't expect it to be as horrible as it was. The sound is so muffled, that I really don't plan to use it. I had gotten these as a replacement for my senhizers after they broke, so after getting used to those, I really couldn't put up with these. I was at least looking forward to the volume control, and find out its an analog one with the dial, not the digital kind that allows you to control the volume of your device directlyAll in all, I guess you get what you paid for, but even for the price, I am not sure it would really be worth it."
2,Very uncomfortible,"These are very cheap, but for a reason. Not very comfortable at all. The are very hard and sit awkwardly in your ear. If you are looking for inexpensive ear buds I would look at jbuds, they are solid. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GS8G0Q/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00"
4,I love it!,"When I first got the headphones I was really excited. It has a little volume controller and each ear piece coming out of it has the same length wire. The white color is nice and doesn't get dirty like the apple ones. They fit nicely in my ears, but I did have to switch out the bigger earbuds for the smaller ones. When listening on the computer, it is fine. When listening on my ipod, I noticed something was off about the music, but I just went into the music controls, did a little tweaking, and they sound just as great as my old headphones!"
2,"Too jank, please try again.","I thought i was getting a deal here with these ear buds. im not an ear bud guy and shouldnt have even tried and gotten these. the buds are cool for having a volume control in line, but thats all except maybe if you just like white ear buds a whole lot. the sound from the speakers sounded weak and far away. to get a satisfactory sound i had to pretty much cram them into my ears and that was very uncomfortable. i also had a problem with them just falling out and changing the size of the noise cancelling tips was no help. my suggestion is to get something else because these are hella bogus."
2,There are better for a few $ more,"These are cheap all around! They are bulky and they dont fit like any other brands I've tried, even $7-10 brands. IMO, do not buy."
2,It sucks eggs...,"Well, its too bad I purchased these ear phones without reading the reviews first....and ITS TRUE! The white ones DO SOUND BETTER, because I've owned them before. These were supposed to be their sexy replacement, but sadly, the sound quality sucks. There is no type of bass and it sounds like your listening to music through a funnel. It has taken some getting used to, but I will definitely replace these as soon as I can. My advice, GET THE WHITE ONES!"
1,Absolute Garbage.,"These are THE WORST, earbuds I have ever had the dissatisfaction of owning. I am very dissapointed in the sound quality and refuse to even use them. They aren't worth the five dollars, and I don't even think I'd use these in an emergency."
2,You get what you pay for....,"Any time I have purchased a product made from Coby I have been reminded that a deal isn't always a deal. Products like this, remind me of why I shouldn't try to save a few bucks on electronics. I should spend the money and buy Sony or Apple, or whatever. The sound quality is horrible, it doesn't work with my ipod shuffle because I can't turn it off. BUYER BEWARE! SPEND 5 MORE DOLLARS AND GET SOME REAL EARBUDS!!!"
3,good sound but really theres no isolation.,the isolation part isnt real. you can hear when someone else is talking when your hearing music. but they do have kinda good sound.
1,These headphones legitimately suck.,"Unless you like blaring music, that you can't understand, and you like distorted music, these are HORRIBLE HEAD PHONES. They truly suck. I wish that I never ever bought them. I HATE THEM."
1,Poor quality sound AND bad design,"I buy the cheap earbuds because I just toss them in my purse. I have had a few pairs of the Coby CVE92 ones, and they are good quality for the money. I figured I would be safe with Coby. But these do not fit well and the design feels awkward. The sound is muffled, which defeats the purpose. if you want a cheap earbud, get the Coby CVE92 instead."
2,Low-Price Earphones == Low-Quality Sound,"When purchasing these earphones for such a low price (from a manufacturer I'd never heard of) that I shouldn't expect much; and I wasn't disappointed. Although I appreciate the older-style volume wheel, the sound produced by this product is of such terrible quality that I've given up using earphones altogether until I can afford a higher quality product; from a higher quality manufacturer."
1,disappointed,"I was really disappointed with these, the sound is FLAT. I should have expected it for the price I paid. I will still use them on my highway trips on my motorcycle just because It is easy to control the volume. I currently have have Coby buds that are great, but they do not have the volume control. I don't know what Coby was thinking."
2,Sort of disappointed,"When I got these earbuds, I was hoping they would surpass my older sony earbuds, but I got what I paid for. But I want to warn you guys now, if you are looking for heavy bass earbuds, these aren't for you, because they have absolutely NO BASS, nada. Overall I would give this a 2 out of 5 just because I'm more of a bass music person."
4,E92 Ftw.,"Not quiete as good as the E92s, but for an emergency backup still usefull.The volume control is really nagging me the most :/"
3,Ear buds for Ipod,"I bought these for my teenage daughter, because she seems to break her earphone buds every 2-3 months. I was tired of spending $20 or more for something that doesn't last. The price was right, but my daughter says the sound is not good and they do not block out the noise like her other skullcandy earbuds."
3,Good for your money,"I've been using this earbud for around 2 weeks. So far I can tell that it's good for the amount you gonna pay.It's not that superb nor that bad in case you only looking for an average quality buds.Bass level is normal, treble is good , length of the cord is good too, an in-line volume controller is a smart touch from Coby.bottom line : Go buy one for yourself if you can't afford the more expensive earbuds."
5,Assesment of Coby Super Bass earphones,I think the earphones were all the manufacturer claim it to be plus more. They are comfortable and the bass is pronounced.
5,Macmillan excells.,Don Macmillan has produced a work of art. He has taken archieve and personal knowledge and combined them to produce a masterpiece of tractor and equiptment history.
5,The DeWalt Keyless Chuck,"I have always wanted to try a keyless chuck on my 38 years old drill. When I came across the one by DeWalt at Amazon I thought I would try it. I made the purchase and installed it on my drill. Wow! What a difference... installing it on my drill was a snap! I no longer get the squealing and chewing of the drill bit as with the old style chuck. Inserting and locking the drill bit in the chuck is extremely easy, not to mention that there is NO key to fight to lock the bit tight enough to keep the bit from slipping, and no key to wear out or lose. I love this keyless chuck and wish I'd gotten one years ago!"
4,Okay,"I'm a big B.G. fan. I think he was the best out of Cash Money. But this album is not really his best. I mean, it's good, but it could've been better. Livin Legend was 5 times better than this. The only good thing though that's better about this album than Livin Legend is that his voice seems to be less affected from the herion and drugs he's been using. His last album seemed as if he was just checkin into rehab or somethin. My favorite songs on this album are the short intro, the second song, and the third song, everything else is just okay. And I don't really feel that song with T.I. that much that he did, it's sort of wack. If you want, you could pick this album up, but if you really want some good B.G. albums, check out:Chopper City In The GhettoCheckmateLivin Legend"
3,ok cd he was better on cash money,ok cd. b.g. was better on cash money.my world{iwant it} is a classic and like that w/ soulja slim is good to. some of the other songs are okay but not that great.good enough to get 3 stars.top 5 in order1.my world(i want it)2.like that f/soulja slim(r.i.p.)3.do what ya wonna do f/bigg gipp and six shot4.get wild with it f/ying yang twins5.street n*gga f/T.I.
5,ANOTHER SOUTH CLASSIC... THE BGIZZLE IS HERE,"This album is HEATED! It will quickly become a classic southern album BG is back and better than ever. He really came back hard on this one. ""I fell off like a bad bag of dope..."" BUT HES BACK ON HIS FEET. Pick the album up ASAP!"
3,"Good, but you'll miss Anita","""Orla Cien"" and ""Ten Sen"" are great songs, although the latter displays some of the emotional flatness of newcomer Katarzyna (Kasia) Stankiweicz's singing. Her voice is pleasant, but lacks the spark that ignited former vocalist Anita Lipnicka's singing. Anita left for a solo career that surprised many by surpassing VM's subsequent efforts. Robert Janson's music on ""Orla Cien"", ""Ten Sen"", and ""Dom - gdzies blisko mnie"" is catchy but does not quite rise to the level of the ""Elf"" CD. And it is already clear that fatigue is creeping in (which will be complete on the weak follow-up CD, ""End""). If you liked ""Elf"" for more than just the vocals, you will probably like this CD. But you really owe it to yourself to check out Anita Lipnicka's solo CDs, which are radiant."
3,Artwork doesn't interest my son,"This is a cute little book, and I bought it for my 1 yr. old son who likes pop-up books. But the artwork is drab and doesn't engage him so he doesn't like this book. I'm a fan of other Robert Sabuda pop-ups though, just not this one."
5,Probably the year's most delicious book!,"Absolutely a stunning feat of paper engineering!You almost wish you could eat the cookies as they pop off the page into your eyes. A clever little story without words occurs behind the simple rhyme that counts out all the cookies. For those watching the waistline, be glad you can only look at the pictures, and this book will stuff only stockings this holiday season and not tummies!"
3,Very disappointed that a damaged new book has arrived today.,"This is a birthday gift for my two-year old daughter.This kind of pop-up books seemes delicate to handle, so I checked its content before she found it.Firstly, the back cover is torn apart. I haven't meant to buy a used book, but it looks so.Then some parts are sealed too tight to pop up, and one broken part is found.Although I ordered three pop-up books this time, only this one disappointed me."
5,Best pop-up ever,Fabulous movement and designs. Great artwork. Well chosen subject matter. Any child would love looking at this book.
5,"Great toy, EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!","My son had his Video Now Jr. for about a year when it quit working. It would come on but the disc would not spin or play. I contacted Hasbro and, with no questions asked, they sent me a postage paid label to return the player and sent a brand new one! I have to say that although I wouldn't rate the player a 5 star item, I would easily give Hasbro 10 stars for their customer service! I have had issues with Fisher Price and all I am going to say is that I would buy Hasbro over Fisher Price ANY day!"
4,Enjoyable Early 80s Folk Rock,"Dave and all the ""Full House"" era Fairport Convention folks crank out lots of tasty fiddle and mandolin tunes (plus one less tasty Sandy Denny song with Swarb on lead vocal). I have never especially enjoyed Swarb's singing, and this is no exception, but at least there is only the one. I especially DO enjoy the sprightly mandolin trios with Swarb, Richard Thompson and Dave Pegg. The fairport gang in general supply tasteful backing to Swarbs fiddle and/or mandolin on most of the tracks. There are also several nice change-of-pace tunes featuring Swarb's old chum Beryl Marriott on piano. Although this album failed to blow me away on first listen, it was pleasant, and it may grow on me with repeated plays."
4,Nice tunes from an old pro,"Fans of Fairport Convention's instrumental side should dig this pair of recordings by their longtime fiddler, Dave Swarbrick. A bunch of his Fairport pals, Richard Thompson among them, join in on this mostly-instrumental outing... Both albums were recorded at the same time in 1981, but released separately for whatever reason. It's nice stuff, though surprisingly heavy on standard-issue reels and such. For my personal tastes, there are too few numbers that really moved me (I tend to like aires and more melodically evocative tunes...) but I'm sure fans of fiddling in general and Fairport in particular will find plenty to enjoy here. A couple of songs do include vocals -- a rare opportunity to hear Swarbrick step up to take the mic..."
5,A fine overview,"This is an excellent, balanced, introductory book, with more content than it's small size might suggest. The ""For Further Reference"" section at the end provides links to further resources."
3,Great Quality Until OT,"This is a 2 disk set-periods 1 and 2 are on disk one, period 3 and OT are on Disk 2-which is not called out in the description. Quality is stellar until the OT period on disk 2, at which point the images become shaky and blurry. Tried disk on 3 DVD players to no avail. Does not appear to be an issue on my laptop DVD player though. I have an email in to NCAA on demand to hopefully rectify, but I would be hesitant to purchase this item as the OT period is a crucial piece of this game."
1,lafebers pellets,"Contrary to lafeber's other products, this food must be made from cardboard and old shoes. I was not able to get the even the wild birds outside to eat it in the dead of winter."
1,Not the greatest,The uke i received had a crack in the base and was a pretty terrible glue job. It doesn't stay in tune at all. Not much to say about this one. Try another brand if mine is any indication.
2,Helen Keller's Uke,"Doesn't hold intonation. Sounds boxy. Feels like a cheep piece of wood, not an instrument. Not even good for beginners. Only function it serves is decorative, and even then, there are better ways you could spend your money."
2,Baritone Ukelele,"The Uke came pretty quick, but I had to get a repair on the frets, so that put me back more money. It's a good product, just not the one I got."
5,Great Job,Great job shipped on time via UPS and was received in good condition. Thank you very much I appreicate it.
1,Avoid this instrument.,"The instrument arrived without being glued together properly. I had to take it to a luthier to have it re-glued. Return shipping costs are too high to make the return worthwhile. Even cheap instruments like this ought to have a higher standard than this. Pay a little more; or at the very least; go for the 'Rogue' or 'Savannah' brands instead. They are cheapos, but of a half-decent quality."
2,Just My Luck,"Received my Hilo Ukulele last Friday 1/20/12. It worked great for 5 days. By working great, I mean it was in tune for the entire length of the fretboard. Then on Wednesday (1/25/12) it developed a ""twangy"" sound. The glue under the fretboard gave way, and I also noticed that the fretboard was bowed. I contacted Amazon and the unit is currently in transit to Amazon. Amazon was very good about delivery and also the return and refund process. I elected to go with the refund instead of replacement."
3,"Great for the price, but still cheap","If you want a cheap baritone uke, this is it. sounds pretty blah, but would probably improve with some decent strings.Mine arrived with a broken neck, i was offered a refund vs replacement. I live a long way, shipping return would have sucked, and no stock left to replace it, so this was the smart thing to do.Since I have a friend who works with Ukes, he fixed it for me, and got it going again easily enough (Just applied a bit of glue and let it set)."
4,decent,Its a little louder than a stock toyota tacoma muffler. I wish it was just a little bit louder but I like it. It sounds good in the truck.
5,Super item,I love using the system. It is great to be upstairs and not have to really yell. The monitor allows us to tell them we are coming to help them. They know that we are on the way to help them or scare away the monsters at night.
1,"piece of crap, plain 'n simple","This is my first review anywhere. I bought two of 'em relying on reviews here, so I could be in contact with my elderly mother downstairs. Less than 20 feet in a regular old house. Nada, crappo, noflo. I ended up getting a Phillips Avent 2-way for close to $100. Crystal clear one-channel with no stupid sub-channels or anything. I've only had it a week, but it's what I expected from the other 2-ways that I had to pay return postage on. Do yourself a favor. Spend the money -- you'll come out in the longrun."
1,Didn't last long...,"We have the tria three way model. We loved this monitor when it worked, as the sound was quite clear and the range excellent. However, four months later, both handsets are broken with no clear reason. They died one at a time about a month apart. They beep continuously with or without the rechargable batteries, and we have tried everything. Will not buy again."
4,More than a baby monitor,"I bought this product to use with my mom who has recently moved in with me due to Parkinson's Disease. The two way feature is especially helpful. When she calls for me, I can immediately answer her, tell her where in the house (or yard) I am, and let her know how quickly I can be to her. She can use her monitor hands free which is also helpful.Evenflo Whisper Connect 900Mhz 2-Way Nursery MonitorEvenflo Whisper Connect 900Mhz 2-Way Nursery MonitorIt is a comfort for us both. So not only is this monitor great for using with babies, but also with elderly parents as well!"
4,great device,"We have it already 3 weeks, it works very well, we can hear every little noise. The 2 way function also works well. We're very satisfied with it and sleep much better since we got it.There are only two minor shortcomings: first, that the baby's unit isn't rechargable, so if you want to move it to where the baby sleeps during the day, for example, you have to plug it to a socket. And second, that once the parent's unit is recharged, it lasts only for one night, maximum two."
5,"Great product, a sleep saver!","This monitor is great. Very sensitive. Very clear. I can hear my son breathing while he is sleeping. I bought this product because my son was afraid to sleep in his own room. It was getting pretty crowded in our bed. He is 7 years old. He was afraid I wouldn't hear him if he got scared in the middle of the night. Since this monitor is 2-way, I can talk to him and he knows I can hear him. It works very well. We tried walkie-talkies, but after spending a small fortune on batteries, because we would have to leave them on all night, these can be plugged in, so it's much better. It's a sleep saver for me and my husband. My son now sleeps in his own bed without any problems. I wish I had thought of this earlier."
4,really nice features,"I like the two way radio, rechargeable batteries, reception is good. You can page the handheld if you misplace it. Very nice"
1,Makes More NOISE than the Baby!!,This thing clicks inceasantly. It fails to pick up minor noises the baby makes and yet clicks and chatters on its own. We already own a Sony BabyCall and it worked great for about a year and then started the same clicking. But at least it worked for a year.
3,"Does the job, put picks up bad interference","This monitor does the job and we can hear our daughter when she wakes up in her crib very clearly. But increasingly we are picking up peoples' phone conversations and getting terrible static. Last night at 5 am we were woken up by loud, screeching static- not what you want when sleep is at a premium. We registered for this because it had some of the highest rated reviews; considering that this baby monitor woke us up for no good reason, I wouldn't get this product again."
4,Great for Baby!,"This monitor works great. We can hear our daughter clearly when she needs us. The price was right too, getting a good product for not a ton of money."
2,Disappointment - Sony is MUCH better,"I received this monitor as a gift with my second child. I also have the comparably priced Sony Baby Call. The Evenflo gets much more interference and the battery doesn't last nearly as long. The Sony is at least a little water resistant. On the Evenflo, the AC adapter spot is open so water (or steam in your bathroom) could easily affect the unit. The Sony is just better and a good long-term investment and doesn't cost any more."
4,Much better than Sony,"We purchased the Sony at Baby's R Us and had to return it. It was horrible. This is much better, but still not perfect. The first Evenflo we had better reception.This was the best we could find."
1,Nice but bad quality,Nice but bad quality. I bought them almost three months ago and they already have a hole in the sole. Even the water comes in. I don't recommend them.
4,"Basically well done, but . . .","Too many weird tangents. As other reviewers have pointed out, Lazare correctly identifies a variety of government policies that have caused urban decay. But most of his points have already been made by other commentators (e.g. James Kunstler, Alex Marshall). Also, Lazare goes off on tangents about things like the life of Henry Ford, labor union policy, etc. which really aren't that relevant to his major point. Like many leftish urbanists, Lazare seems to think that good urbanism leads to a liberal welfare state -- yet that most urban of industrialized nations, Japan, has a government as small as that of America."
5,Best Fantasy Book Ever!,"Sparks of Rebellion is an exciting book that captures your attention from the very first page to the very last. It draws you in with its characters that are very complex and real. Unlike a lot of fantasy books Sparks of Rebellion keeps moving. There's a lot of action and fantasy fans all over the world will be more than satisfied.This new fantasy world is also quite unique. It is very detailed and realistic, and the creatures are one of a kind. Even its elves, dwarves, halflings, dragons, and monsters are not your stereotypical races. For example, goblins aren't half-sized monsters but human-sized thugs with half intelligence. Carnei is a solidly created world with its own languages, history, races, maps, etc. It's as exciting as watching The Lord of the Rings Movies and as captivating as the novels. I've read it a number of times, and I can't get enough. There simply is no equal!"
4,Nice to Look At,"This a nice stuffed animal, and a cute change from the standard teddy bears. I think my favorite thing about it is that it actually looks like a real octopus, not cartoonish, which is what I am used to seeing. My 18-month old likes it since it's big and bright-colored and he likes to throw it. If you're looking for an educational, interactive toy, then this is not the one....but as a decoration or a durable stuffed toy, it works."
3,"OK, but a little wobbly",We got this to use with the Solar Group mailbox and it was definitely super easy to install and worked with the mailbox nicely. The only problem is that the mailbox is very wobbly despite the fact that we put this in the ground as specified. We are likely going to have to pull it out and take a trip to Home Depot for a bigger wooden post and some concrete because the mailbox teeters whenever we open the door to get the mail. Would have liked for this to work out because it was definitely an easy installation!
3,A little light,"The product was a little light for use in my area.It was exactly as pictured ,and may hold up in an urban area,but in a wet season it would be easy to tilt.One advantage however,it would be extremely easy to install compared to a full length post and concrete.Would also save you a trip to the hardware store when Amazon delivers it."
4,Anchor Post Kit,Fantastic product! It's only negative is not using pressure treated wood since it has direct contact with the ground.
5,essential when installing a rubbermade mail box,this item is essential when installing rubbermade mail boxes... this item installs in less than a minute with a simple hammer. And once the rubbermade box assembled it takes seconds to screw mail box to the post using a drill..
3,Mail box post,"Would be better if the wooden post were longer, so that when the mail box was slipped over the post, the post came all the way to the top of the plastic sleeve."
2,post kit,I don't feel the post is long enough for the mailbox. It isn't real stable. The mailbox is top heavy and this doesn't seem to be sturdy enough to hold it.
1,Who is Leroy in Poland,"If u want to listen to Polish Hip - hop this is not a best choice. Liry is the worst polish hip - hop artist I ever seen. I absolutely agree thet the best choice is Paktofonika or Kaliber 44. You must also know that to undarstand polish hip - hop it's not enough to only know polish language, u must also know a exact sytuation of polish tenagers."
5,The cd is good but a bit mellow,I got this cd when I was in Poland and I do like it but some of the songs just don't hit. You have to be able to speak polish in order to really like some of the songs. There are some fantastic songs that me and my friends really like too.
1,Beyond awful,"If you like clichéd, one-dimensional characters and plots telegraphed via sledgehammer, you'll enjoy this book. I slogged through the first two books of the trilogy through sheer determination, but 1/3 of the way through this one I just couldn't take it any more. Spend your money on something better - there's plenty out there."
2,fun in a National Enquirer kind of way...,"Reading this book is akin to watching ""Spinal Tap."" It's played serious but you can't help but laugh. In that respect, it's a fun book to read, nothing heavy but could be an entertaining afternoon.The major problem with the book is it's adoration of Anton LaVey. It's been known for some time he was nothing but a conman and most of what he told the public about himself were lies. Despite the author's claim to present Satanism ""warts and all,"" he conspicously avoids the largest wart in the book!"
5,Lucifer..rising...rise with him,This was a good read detailing the history of Satanism. One of the few books I can think of on the subject written from a Satanists perspective. ....
4,Looking forward to a hellishly good read,"I haven't read this book yet, but i've been looking for it since I heard that it mentions Glenn Danzig."
5,La Crosse Technology wireless weather station,"We found the weather station easy to set up and use. We have had a very cold winter so far with a lot of snow, so it has been a joy to see the weather indoors. We have found it to be accurate and amazing."
1,Does not work with additional sensors,"While the instructions and the manual lead you to believer that this unit works with additional sensors, it does NOT!."
5,Great Product!,I have been very pleased with this product. I did not have any problems setting the station up and it has worked perfectly ever since. Would recomend it to anyone looking for a wireless weather station.
4,La Crosse Technology Wireless Weather Station,Quite satisfied with the two installed units in two homes. One station lost it's atomic clock signal during a heavy rainstorm but has since reacquired the signal. Pity that there's no tide indicator but the outstanding price reflects the lack thereof. Two thumbs up...
4,Awesome for anyone who loves the outdoors!,"We (my fiance and I) LOVE this weather station! We have the outdoor sensor outside (under our grill that's covered)- and it's GREAT!We check the monitor (station) every morning to see what the weather's like- it's been helpful on really cold or hot days, and it definitely helps us know the humidity and how it would feel to go be active outside!This does not have a wind detector....and it does have a ""cheap"" feel to it- it's large and ""cumbersome"" to have sitting on a dresser or table.As my other half puts it ""it's not like it was designed by Apple. It's not a very 'sexy' piece of equipment"".But, it definitely does the job, and gives us the information we want! It's definitely worth the money!"
5,Christmas Gift,This being a Xmas gift I don't know how well it will do. If it's anything like mine it should do fine.
1,PIECE OF JUNK!,My weather station was a piece of JUNK. After one year I took the batteries out (properly) I must add to change them because they were going down and it hasn't worked right since. I did all that la crossetold me to do to reset it but it was to no avail. I will NEVER buy anything that comes from or is made by la crosse AGAIN because all Igot from them was a piece of JUNK.
3,Under the weather...,"After initially receiving my weather station, I tried in complete frustration to get the remote sensor to work. Onecall to Lacrosse, and they determined my remote sensor was D.O.A. and sent me a new one. Somehow the new sensor made it from Wisconsin to California in 2 business days (YAY).Everything (now) works fine, except my weather forcast feature (which is claims to be 75% accurate), tells me it is suppose to rain at least twice a day... Everyday for the last 3 weeks... Guess what... No rain... Except the one day it showed it was supposed to be sunny. It also is giving me a humidity reading of 10-20% higher than www.weatherchannel.com does on it's website. So I'm not impressed with tyhe accuracy... And I'm definately not impressed with the overall construction... Cheap plastics ruin the overall look and feel of the product."
5,Absolutely the best weather station/atomic clock ever owned!,This is the best system i've ever bought. It's several years old now and still works perfectly. It looks great too. Never ever had an issue. Sensors work at over 100 feet and i'm using 3. Would definately buy again.
2,"Fun, but poorly made","The unit is a lot of fun to have, and easy to set up and install. However, it is a poorly made item. The feet for the base unit, and the mounting hardware for the outdoor unit, are very cheaply made. Also, the barometric pressure sensor stopped working after less than a month. I would not buy this product again, though I would like it quite a lot if it was well made."
2,Be Careful Before You Buy,"Be careful before you buy this one. The display is so dim that you have to go right up to it to read it. Battery life is short. Watch out when you change the batteries. It has to be re-set and heaven help you if you've misplaced the instructions. You'll never get it! In short, this is not user-friendly in any acceptable meaning of the term."
2,A might-have-been,"It's a brilliant conception, but spoiled by dreadful acting (the actors all appear to be on permanent automatic pilot - or something) - and inept direction and camera work. I enjoyed it up to a point, but I was constantly thinking ""this could have been so much better""."
2,not as good as the others,"I loved Neale's Conversations with God books. This book says tobe brutally honest, so that is what I will be about this book. I got nothing from it. I am disappointed that all it does is attack the establishment ( mainly military) without any constructive alternatives. Dr Blanton seems to me an angry manwho assumes he is always right. Neale's part of the book is less abrasive. Maybe they have something useful to say here but I didn't get it. If you haven't read Neale's other books don't start with this one."
4,Fantastic Game,I love this game and this book has all the rules you need along with plenty of flavor and background. It's cleverly written and entertaining even when in the sections about rules.The only real weakness I see in the book is the layout. The page numbers listed on the table of contents don't usually match up with the actual pages that the chapters start on. Also the index is surprisingly sparse. If you're looking for a specific rule you'll probably have to do some searching.Overall it's a great book. If you want to try out the Vampire LARP then get this book.
3,A Necessity,"Laws of the Night contains just about everything you need to run or play in a Vampire LARP. I say ""just about"" because the number of contradictions and vaguaries make house rules a necessity. However, if you're a creative soul, I've found that this is really the only book that you truly need. If you're prepared to deal with situations that the rules don't cover and are capable of covering interpretations of the book's many contradictions, then you'll be fine.It's fairly well-written and not too hard to reference. The photographs for the book leave a good deal to be desired. The models and scenes are corny and are a great source of amusement, but do little to contribute to the feel of the game.If you're interested in LARPing, then pick it up. The mechanics are useful to know and can cover a wide number of games, not just Vampire. However, if like me you collect roleplaying games as interesting reads I'd pass it by."
5,Beautiful,"This was a very hard to find book for quite awhile it was almost impossible, considered a collector's item among many M.E.T. players. Beautifully bound in black leatherette cover, embossed with silver lettering, silver edged pages, and ribbons to mark your place in the book. A beautfiful book."
2,"Easy to use, but...","Scale displays only partial after using one day.So I can't see if it's 3 or 5 or 8....Easy to use, so they should improve front panel quality."
4,Good product.,Pros: Easily to use and read. Seems to be accurate and precise.Cons: Wish the top were larger to prevent flour and sugar from falling from the edge of the weighing platform to the area below the platform where cleaning is difficult.
2,IF the batteries lasted it would be great,"Polder KSC-310-28 Easy Read Digital Glass Top Scale, SilverI received this as a Christmas gift and did not take it out of the box until March, when I needed to weigh kittens which was primarily why I wanted it. It looks very nice, is easy to read, can be used easily with a bowl or without, and takes up little space BUT the original batteries lasted about 10 minutes. I hoped that they were old or just cheap batteries (they weren't name-brand) and bought a pair of name-brand replacement batteries for $6.50. These did a bit better - probably lasted 15 minutes. But this is completely unsustainable over the long haul. And now I discover that I have to return the product to the manufacturer paying the postage BOTH ways for them to decide whether to repair or replace, or if it's even their fault. Why, if your product is defective, must your customer pay the shipping charges both ways? I am completely unimpressed with the manufacturer's handling of warranty matters."
3,Good but only for a year.,I purchased this a year ago. It worked great at first and I loved it. But one day it just quit working. I tried to replace the batteries (2 more expensive 3-volt CR2032 batteries) but it still won't work. I just purchased another model. Hope this one lasts longer than a year.
4,As Advertised,"We like the Polder digital scale very much. It's easy to read -- as advertised -- which is very important to us, and the appearance is attractive, very sleek and modern."
4,"Great scale, works as advertised, very easy to read","Looked at many scales and at Food Network's Alton Brown's recommendation tried to find a scale to weigh up to 11 pounds. Did not like those that did for various reasons, mostly large size. The Polder weighs up to 6.5 lb. and has proven to be just fine. My main purposes are to weigh flour and other dry ingredients for baking, and for smoothies. My glass blender jar is 3.6 lb and the 6 smoothie ingredients, at 4 oz. each, are another 1.5 lb so well under the max device capacity. Scale is easy and quick to tare as each ingredient is added. Only concern is that when adding liquid ingredients, there is sometimes a delay for the added weight to actually change the display, so add slowly or stop for a second or two until display catches up, otherwise you could easily add too much. As other reviewers mentioned this scale is compact, absurdly simple to use, very easy to clean, works well."
2,"""splashdown"" it ain't...","Those of us, like one of the other reviewers here, who relished and cherished the blissful psychedelic dreampop of the self-titled album (sadly out of print, but sure to turn up in some bargain bin as the lonely detritus of Sony's ill-fated attempt at licensing Creation releases for the US market... anyone remember Idha?...) probably will not find much appeal in this release. Rather than a return to form, it's a progression into the electronic world in the post-rock Chicago vein, and while personally I'm all for the Morr Music school of prettytronica, it all just makes me want to dig out the 1992 album. But then, those of us who also liked the Telescopes' kick-out-the-jams persona a la 'Taste' may find this release even that much farther from their initial point of reference.On the other hand, what sad state of affairs does this reflect when one waxes nostalgic over shoegazing? Whatever. I'm digging out my copy of Ride's 'Nowhere'. ""Vapour Trail."" Yum. :)"
4,Durable Sword,"This sword has made it through Christmas, except for the small attachements, which was to be expected! My son is still playing with this after two and a half weeks. Worth the money"
4,magi staff......,my five year old is a die hard power ranger fan!! so anything power ranger he wants!! this toy is one of the most interesting thus far from the mystic force series!! there are three or four different weapons all in one toy!! for a mom on the go that is really wonderful!! it is alot less to carry around and alot less to have to pick up!! the magi staff does make sounds and they arent really loud. all in all this is areally great toy!!
4,Realistic and Intriguing Police Procedural,"Serpent Gate is my first McGarrity novel and I am duly impressed with his work. I found the story to be intriguing and Kearney very likable. McGarrity's characters are, for the most part, ""real"" people who live in a world with shades of gray. His writing is solid, though he delivers no lines that you will remember, his words fulfill their purpose of driving the story forward. I particularly liked Mr. McGarrity's plotting; his involvement of two separate cases added to the realism as the novel. I enjoyed Serpent Gate and I plan on coming back to McGarrity's other works."
2,HO - HUM at it's best,"What a yawn. No exposition, emotion, or description, generic characters and situations we have all seen before in better written novels. SEE: the strong silent lawman, SEE: the evil Mexican drug lord, SEE: the wacky supporting characters, an old guy so cliche-gay -it's-amazing-he-doesn;t-fly-thru-the-air. Plus a cagy-smelly-nutjob-who-knows-more-than-willing-or-able-to-say. SEE: the head-shaking regret over the spoiling of a once-pristine smallish town. SEE: the bored housewife dropping this book and going off to find something more interesting to do , like laundry."
4,A continuing pleasure,"This series keeps geting better with each entry. The author is not afraid to let a bad guy get away, he'll come back later in the series, as we've already seen. The author can leave some questions unanswered, because he knows we'll be back for the next installment. A lot like life, we need to come back tomorrow and see how things turn out. Normally this would drive a reader crazy, but with McGarrity enough questions are answered to leaved the reader sated and happy to return."
5,#3 does charm!,"I have now devoured all 3 McGarrity and I'm wishing for more. Kevin Kerney is sexy, dangerous and moral. Pick up this book ASAP if you have read ""Tularosa"" and ""Mexican Hat"", if you haven't read the first 2, BUY all 3 and read them in order."
5,HE'S DONE IT AGAIN!!! THIS ONE'S A GRABBER!,"he's done it again!!! usually, the third book is the one that does in new authors but this one is a winner!!! mc garrity is just getting better and better with each book....and i just love his great cast of characters....hopefully, we'll be seeing fletcher again...and the women allllllllll adore kerney, don't they? mc garrity writes such vivid descriptions of every scene that you are there...you feel the winter air or the hot mexican sun on your back...you sense the terror of a shootout...keep 'em coming and i'll keep on enjoying....one book a year is just a perfect pace!!!! also, the cover of each book is so beautiful...thank goodness, what's inside equals the cover!!"
5,Romantic,I highly recommend this CD for all married couples. (Single couples listening to this CD on dates will soon have reason to get married - so be careful.) It is a CD that you must give as a gift to all couples you know because you will not be lending them your copy - if you do never expect to get it back. I never remove mine from the sound system in my bedroom. (You will find out why soon enough - when you hear this CD.)There is no need for any other CD. It is sooo seductive. I promise you will not regret buying this one.
4,Covertec Case does the Job,"Case protects the device very well. The cover extends over the sides enough to protect them as well. I would give it five stars, but the belt clip is NOT secure IMHO. I would recommend it."
4,A little slow-paced,"After having just been introduced to Feist, I've only just read this book a while ago. It's a good read but has a huge change of pace from his usual books. Instead of focusing on the royals (ConDoins), he focuses on two ordinary people, Erik and Roo, who get caught up in the war.If you like your action fast, this is definitely not the book for you as it concentrates on stocks, bonds and the dealings of the business world in Krondor. It was interesting to see how business works in Krondor if not a little on the slow side.The characters are fairly interesting (esp. Calis) and there are some new ones such as Dash and Jimmy (James' grandsons). However, some characters don't really work such as Miranda.All in all, not Feist's finest but certainly entertaining."
2,A lemon,"I love Raymond Feist's Midkemia novels, but I don't like this one. I found the main character to be unsympathetic and difficult to sympathize with. Normally his characters are not so sophomoric."
5,Give this a try,Read the whole series and you will not be disappointed. feist is a great story teller so get ready for the ride
4,A Different Sort of Focus...,"Picking up right where _Shadow of a Dark Queen_ ended, this book shared none of the slow introduction of that book. The action began immediately. It focused on Rupert Avery, or ""Roo"", though in typical Feist-fashion, the other main players' P.O.V.s were still touched upon through the book. Roo is one of the least likable of Feist's characters and this book's business focus set it apart from the others. It is a unique fantasy book that introduces a stock market and options! Still, the book stayed entertaining and exciting, if in a different fashion than the other books, with deeper intricacies of the plot unfolding."
4,Very Good,"After being used to the quality of Feist's writing, I foundthis novel to be not quite matching the fast-paced yetdetailed novels previously written, particularly whencompared to 'The Kings Buccaneer' and 'Shadow Of A DarkQueen'. It was refreshing to take a look at the kingdom froma different perspective, namely its trade and commerceinstead of its military situation, but I must admit I wasmore interested in the chapters concerning Erik and Calis'mission to Novindus. The impending confrontation with thedemons is going to be explosive, and I cannot wait for thenext novel."
1,Couldn't even finish it,"I started reading this book when it first came out, but put it down when I finally grew too disgusted with the main character (Roo) to care about how it turned out (except to hope for his well-deserved death, frankly). The way he treats the people close to him is seedy at best, and repulsive at worst. After reading Feist's much better earlier works (particularly the Empire series), I was *very* disappointed with this entry in the Midkemian saga."
2,Shoddy.,"While the story is fine (though this does mark the beginning of Feist's downward spiral from respected author to money-grubbing hack), the Kindle edition was apparently generated by scanning (with optical character recognition) a print copy of the book. No proof-reading was done, which resulted in irritating spelling, punctuation, etc errors on nearly every page. Additionally, unlike more professionally done e-books, this has no chapter markers in the Kindle's progress bar.Buy the paperback. It's cheaper and has fewer errors."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Cash over swords.The second book of the Serpentwar series follows Roo Avery as he gets involved in financial machinations, trying to bootstrap himself into the world of Midkemian big business, and all the deviousness and underhandedness that goes along with that. He still prefers this to people trying to separate parts of his body from the rest with weaponry or magic.The conflict with the Dark Queen won't go away, and even rich businessmen will be needed in the war."
4,Didn't have problem with this book,"That is when it finally got off its rocker and decided which direction it was going in(it takes a signifigant amount of time). I like Roo less than I like Erik so I found this book a lttle hard to get into at first. Than about halfway through the book I started to realize that the charecter of Rubert Avery was starting to grow on so I ended up not minding all that much. This is all coupled with the fact that there was some very cool ""Power behind the throne"" stuff, an approach in fiction that I have always been partical to.Overall-Thew most redeming quality of this book for me was that if left off at exactly the point where the book should have ended. You know, when you read a book and you feel that the book should ended ten chapters ago? There is none of that feeling here, I can't wait for my chance to read book 3."
3,Just the middle book of the series,"Though the book was not horrible, I would say I felt it was a forced reading on my part. It did develop Roo's character more, but quite frankly the reason I read fantasy Adventure novels is to read about adventure, not about how a fictional character makes it financialy in a fictional world. Unfortunatly I do feel it is required reading if you wish to continue with reading the series which overall I felt was pretty good."
2,so -so,"I've been reading Raymond E. Feist's books since the Magician, and..this book is the worst of all.The main characters, Roo and Erik , I think, are boring. Not exciting as the characters in other books like Pug, Jimmy .I was disappointed.To the AUTHOR :PLEASE write about the characters that have good characters, and interesting enough. Since this is a fantasy book, why not follow Prince or King or Magician,instead of following two very ordinary people."
2,HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT,"Of all the books I read by Feist this was by far the worst. When I read book in the genre of fantasy I expect,well, a fantasy. This is where this book fell short in my opinion. It was simpliy not a fantasy exept for the end with Erik. The book is (with the previously stated exeption) about Roo's rise to wealth and fame. Its a few hundered pages of a man becoming rich. No magic, battles or anything else you would expect from a fantasy.Also, the change in Roo is to differnet from the last book. Roo went from being a troublemaker with a good heart to an adulterer, murderer, and a drug dealer. If you think about it he's closer to a mob boss than a merchent. The only things he cares for are money and women. The only reason why I didnt give it one star was due to very good ending. My advice is to skim the book up to last 100 pages and then read thouroughly."
1,Complete waste of paper,"When I read a fantasy book, I expect there to be elements of fantasy in the book. This thing reads like a business journal. A little action please? A little adventure please? A little excitement please?If you like reading about people sitting in coffee houses and discussing business propositions, then grab this book right away - This is for you!However, if you like some fighting, adventuring, and pure escapism, then burn this book as soon as you come in contact with it.The serpentwar saga is the worst set of fantasy books I have ever read. And to think this same Author wrote the magician series...A pity..If I could have given this snooze fest negative stars, I would have..."
1,Feist needs some new ideas,Worst thing Feist has written yet. They'd been getting steadily worse for a while but at least they remained entertaining. This book was a struggle to get through. Erik and Roo are his dullest characters yet. Mindless.
5,"Greed is Good, Greed Works....",I was truly tired of reading other authors make their characters wealthy beyond imagination simply by finding it in a dungeon and slaughtering everything in sight. Roo's ambition for commercial conquest became a driving force of greed that could only be rivaled by the ensuing armies of the Emerald Queen. This is by far my favorite book by Feist.
2,"Adequate, but just barely","I picked this up expecting an exciting sequel to Feist's page-turning Shadow of A Dark Queen but was disappointed to discover little more than a flimsy pseudo-sequel that reads more like a business text than a fantasy novel. Most of us fantasy readers have little interest in syndicates, trading enterprises, etc., even if they do involve the beloved Roo Avery. Roo is revealed as a rather unappealing and shallow character; Erik's presence in the story is tantalizing, as he appears but is scarcely granted any character development. This addition to the series doesn't add much, nor does it satisfy any of the curiosities left behind at the end of the first novel. Still, it's not as bad as it could be."
4,Rise of a Merchant Prince,"The sequal doesn't measure up to the Original? Are you dense or just of low intelligence?In the first book, Shadow of a Dark Queen, we met the characters, and set the scenario, then we watched them grow up and become men. In Rise of a Merchant Prince, yes we do focus on Roo, more than Eric or Calis, but it not only sets the scene for Rage of a Demon King, It continues to show Both Eric and Roo evolving into more complex characters, and still discovering who they are in the world.Oh and if you didn't like the the characters evolving and becoming more like real humans than fictional non entities, your gunna hate the next one...HURRAH for Feist."
2,Disappointed,"I have eagerly followed Raymond Feist's books, from Magician through the Riftwar and onwards. But this book made me wish I had not tried to keep up with this recent trilogy.The book is like a trashy romance novel, and the way Roo treats his women is contemptuous and without excuse. Feist appears to have wondered what to do in between novels, and this has caused a great rift in my desire to read the first, and my complete desire not to buy the third.Here's hoping that the next novel returns to form, and that I can once again enjoy the Feist I have come to know and love."
4,Inrtrigue is what it is all about,"Many people feel dissapointed about this book, mainly because there use to large giant battles and adventures, this is not that. this book will really appeal to all those who loved the Empire series, there is Intrigue a plenty to keep you happy. I enjoy a book that makes you think you have it and then twists at the end. A definitive book on the series, a little dissapointed with chracter evoltuion thoug"
2,This is not Science Fiction Fantasy.,"This is basicly a cheap romance novel with a very minimal amount of fantasy, except for Roo's business acumen. Roo has few redeeming features. By far Feist's worse try. I am not sure I even wish to look at ""Rage of a Demon King"" now."
4,Another excellent adventure told by the Master,"Feist surperbly creates intrigue, lust, and suspense in this novel. The story is full with adventure as the reader endures victory and sadness with the characters. Another enthralling Feist novel which will hook readers and leave them anxious to read his NEXT novel."
2,"Dissapointed, The book is a gap in the new saga's story","After enjoyed the whole Riftwar saga books, and started again with 'Shadow of a Dark Queen'(the first novel of Feist's new saga), I was eager to know more about. But this second book 'Rise of a Merchant Prince' is pretty boring, in Roo's tale, the characters don't develop well. The story is a 'domestic one' and not an heroic quest, the whereabouts of Roo in his search of richness are like the bad chapters of 'Dallas T.V. Series' of the eighties."
4,"Loud, but somewhat high frequency","Took me about 2 hours to install. I used as much of the already existing hardware on my 1998 Ford Expedition as possible. (see customer pictures and corresponding notes) Another reviewer mentioned spending 300 to have it installed professionally, which is ridiculous. It really wasn't that hard to install... I think he got ripped off.The sound is exactly what I expected based on the ""Check out related media"". It is a lot louder than the stock horns, but I still wish it would have been a lower frequency.The only thing that bothered me about the installation was mounting the compressor. The bolt that secures the compressor to your vehicle spins freely as you tighten the nut, and considering how cramped the area was where I installed the horns, I was getting pretty frustrated trying to tighten the nut/bolt."
4,Wolo Long Horns,"Excellent product, although I was expecting a lower tone. I did have some difficulty mounting the horns in my 2005 Ford E-150. I finally had to put them on the wheel well under the coolant resivour. Not the location I had imagined, but they work very well there. The length called for some creative mounting, but in all a fine product. I highly recommend that you check the length in the description to make sure they will work where you want them to. Otherwise they are a welcome addition/replacement to the factory horn."
1,Compressor quit,The compressor went out after a few days. Nice loud horn when it worked. I did not contact the Wolo as I threw away the packaging. I guess that's what I got for $26.00.
4,"Good, but not the best.","I purchased the same horn at a store after reading the reviews on hear, and decided that I might as well give it a try. I already had the smaller version mounted and wired in on the passenger side under the hood, so I wired in and mounted these on the driver side under the hood. With all 4 at once, it has a pretty good sound. Plenty loud, sounds like some of our trucks (My family owns a trucking company). Not all semi horns have the deep sound that people think of, some are higher such as these horns. After installing them, I am glad I bought them, but my only griping point is that they had a weird mounting system, so I just zip tied them in place, and have no other complaints."
3,Installed in F-150,"This is a loud horn that will catch the attention of inattentive drivers. Unlike the big rig horns that apparently have pressurized tanks that instantly create airflow (and thus sound), this horn has an electo-mechanical compressor that drives the horn directly; there is no tank and so there is no instant sound -- you have to have your hand on the button for a fraction of a second before the horn will sound. Under normal situations, this is not important. Under emergency situations, this could be problem. I also wonder how well it will work with my alarm, because when I lock my car remotely, there is not enough airflow to sound the notification warning. Lastly, it is a REAL PAIN to install. It took my mechanics 4 hours and nearly $300 for the parts and labor necessary to install it. Had I known what it would take to install, I would have avoided this horn and opted for a loud standard horn that could be installed with ease."
2,$40 Shipping,This item was ordered Over two weeks ago with a shipping cost of $40 and I have not received either it or any word as to why it was delayed. With a $40 shipping charge I would expect better then this treatment.
5,Now I Get It!,As the aunt of a nut allergic child - I had really never understood the problem. My own children don't have this allergy so I just didn't get it. My sister has a copy of this handbook and MADE me read it.Now I get it. I recommend this book to anyone who ever has or will have to care for a nut allergic child. I know that the bright yellow page with the instructions for how to use an epipen as well as all the personalized information will be very comforting whenever I have her kids.
1,"As the author indicates, this book is written based on fear. This book did more harm than good.","As a mother of a son newly diagnosed with a peanut allergy, this book did more harm than good. It is written, as the writer admits, out of fear. Yes, this is a dangerous allergy and great caution needs to be taken, but fear is not the answer. Parents and children need faith, support, and strength when confronting this challenge. There is no information in this book that is not found on the Web or in related books authored by medical professionals."
5,Easy to read and share!,"I have a nut allergic toddler and have read all of the information I could find. This book is the easiest to read. It skips alot of the whys and background info. It is great for a babysitter and for relatives who will be providing food for your child. I bought four copies and had all of our relatives read it and any prospective babysitters (and any future teachers). It helps them to keep your child safe and in the case of an emergency, tells how to recognize reactions and what to do. A must have!"
2,Too general,"I have an infant that was just diagnosed with peanut allergies. This book was highly recommended - but I have to wonder if it was only by people with no common sense. There is nothing in this book that common sense doesn't tell you. And where the author has the opportunity to supply details or action information that can be used, she fails to go that extra step. The author repeatedly says to supply a list of ""alternatives"" to peanut snacks to other parents, but doesn't share what those alternatives are! She says peanuts are hidden in all sorts of items like common body creams and shampoo but doesn't list any brands! Thanks, Sheila for your taunting tone of, ""I did the research and want to wave it under your nose, but you can't have it!"" This book was a waste of money and a waste of the 20 minutes it took me to read it. Not worth the time and effort I put into tracking it down. I need real information I can use to save my child's life, this book didn't help."
2,No new information,"If you have a child with a peanut allergy and you have already done your research, then this book does not contain any new information. If you are just starting to research information on peanut allergy then this book may be useful in some areas. It is not a big book and is not very long. The book does, however, give you the option to personalize it to your child (you write your child's name in the blanks)and gives detailed instructions to leave caregivers on how to use the Epipen and a place to put emergency contact information...but it is not worth the money. If you can get it used or for half the price...then it is worth it...Otherwise, type ""peanut allergy"" into Google and get the same info for free."
3,Poor Quality,You can tell it was cut a paste project--- I could have made theses myself. Please do not spend your hard earned dollars... Disappointed !!!
3,Good on all but technique,"As a total beginner, I thought this book was very strong on presenting information about materials and archival vs. non-archival and such. However, I found the author's instructions on specific techniques to be lacking...I often had to read them many times just to understand a fairly simple procedure."
2,I was disappointed with the content of this book.,The author uses terminology which he has not previously defined and the instructional steps are not always easily understandable.
1,A huge mistake,"As a non-muslim woman who has traveled to iran, i am appalled at what this book states. the situation is not nearly as horrible as the book states; indeed, it is only one of many books written to demonize the good religion of islam and its followers. to all women out there who want to read books by actual muslims: read material from the people who practice the religion, not from people who despise it and want to spread hatred of a religion."
1,Clearly one-sided,"Reading this book was like reading a speech by adolph hitler...someone with a twisted view out to force their view on everyone. As a Muslim, I was shocked by the inaccuracies in this book -- this is a classic example of reflecting a few people's behavior on to those of billions. Read this book with care and keep in mind the gross inaccuracies."
1,Truth and Ignorance mixed together,"Although this is a very tragic story, the author is fighting ignorance with ignorance. We all know that Iran is extremely dictorial and has about as much to do with Islam as the US has to do with Christianity. Anything negative that happens in a Muslim country people always blame Islam, however no Muslim would ever hold Chhristianity responsible for happeniings in US. We live in such an ignorant and hate filled society, it really is a shame. :("
1,Completely inaccurate and opinionated,"The reason why this book is such a ""page-turner"" is because it is pure entertainment and completely out of touch with reality. There is no substantial evidence to support any of Dr. Parvin Darabi's theories, except for a personal experience which she uses to demonize an entire religion. The book is extremely inaccurate in it's protrayal of Muslims as a whole, and quite demeaning. Readers be aware that this book is a false depiction of Islam, and should be read the way it was written...as pure entertainment."
1,There is a problem in generalization,"Ms. Darabi is a well-known crusader against Islam. Her views on this faith have been shaped by tragic death of her sister, so her reactions are quite understandable. However, to generalize such personalized feelings into condemning a religion is criminal.I won't recommend this book to anyone."
5,Reads like a novel,"Well-written and informative, moving and touching, this cultural biography is a real page-turner that reads like a novel."
5,Mystical,"I just read this book and wanted to write my review. Since Ibelieve in God, I think Dr. Homa Darabi's act was ordained by God tobring the plight of the Muslim women to the world's attention. Growing up as a muslim girl, my rights were constantly violated by my father, brothers and male cousins. What Parvin Darabi and Romin P. Thomson describe in Rage Against the Veil is a life lived by many women in the Islamic world. I was told that my function in life as a woman is to marry and bear children and to serve my husband and my children all my life with no expectations for mine. This book is any Muslim woman's life. This book is about my life, my female friends and relatives life. I am so pleased that this book is written which tells the world what women like Dr. Homa Darabi and so on have lived through. I am buying this book and giving it as gifts and I ask others to do the same. Thank you Parvin Darabi and Romin P. Thomson to tell others what we go through. END"
1,Disappointed,"Nichole Nordeman and Jennifer Knapp are two of my favourite female Christian artists - and it was their involvement in this album that inspired me to purchase it. From the very first listen I was disappointed at the lack of depth in both the music and the lyrics. The music lacks solidity, the lyrics are somewhat predictable and lack the depth that I would usually associate with Nichole and Jennifer's own music. I look forward to more albums from Nichole and Jennifer, but I will be more careful about compilations such as this in the future."
5,Tapestry for His Glory!!!,"I bought this CD when it came out (1999) for Michelle Tumes & Jennifer Knapp. Several years later and I'm still listening. Each song is beautifuly woven together (better some times that the City on a Hill series) and reflect the glory of God through the voices, melodies, images, movement of the listener to worship. I rediscover this CD in challenging times in my live. It helps me resettle in the peace, healing, and joy found in Jesus. Buy this CD!!! It will introduce you to several powerful women vocalists and bring joy to your heart."
3,"Good, but instructions lacking","These bars look good, and seem sturdy on my 04 Dodge RAM, but the instructions are seriously lacking - fuzzy black and white photos in which you can barely see how things go together, washers which are too big to fit in the designated space, etc... Really, just a few good assembly drawings and a bit more care in the instructions would make these 5 star in my book. Took me 2 hours to put 'em on, start to finish - most of that was just trying to figure out what bits they were talking about."
2,missing items / bent,"Box came torn up, instructions were missing. black plactic cap that cover the edges of the bars to prevent metal to metal contact were missing. I contacted Westin and they emailed me the instructions. I'm going to contact them again to see fi they will send the plastic caps.. they look nice in the box. All the brackets are the exactly the same as the OEM bars (black) I'm replacing. Waiting to here back from Westin before install, seems like it should be pretty straight forward. If Westin doesn't send caps I can see these things rusting out quick. - Still waiting to hear back from Westin, it's only been 3 days, 2 were over the weekend. I decided to pull the bars out and polish them up while I am waiting to hear back.. I found that these bars are dented, scratched, metal looks to have fatigue stress marks.. Not as clean as they appeared at first glance. Very disappointed.."
4,Westin 23-2310 Polished Step Bars,"These bars are very nice and farely easy to install. The directions were pretty vague but if someone has just a little mechanical knowledge, they can figure out how to install them. It took about an hour or so to install these bars with very minimal tools. These step rails look really good on my truck, I'd recommend them to anyone wanting to put step rails on their truck."
5,Reading about Markov processes and semigroups,It's a very good book to read about this subject. It is clear and well organized. I fully recommend it.
5,Tamplin Delivers,"Anyone who says anything negative about Ken Tamplin simply has no clue what real music really means. ""Tamplin"" is a heavily studio produced CD that showcases two things: Screaming guitar and Ken's amazing 4 octave voice. If you buy any CD by Ken Tamplin, buy this one."
3,Not great for cycling...,While this brought back memories of living in the lovely Monterey Bay area it was too slow paced to watch while spinning so it got a bit...boring! I like to go fast when I ride! Some camera work was a bit shaky - sudden large pans which made me have to close my eyes - and seemed out of focus at times. Might be more enjoyable if you are on a treadmill.
2,"Slow leisurely walk, NOT a workout!","I had rented this video with the intention of using it to get the feeling of walking outside while walking on my treadmill. Although the scenery is beautiful, the person shooting it walks at a VERY slow pace and I didn't get the feeling I was working out at all. I walk on the treadmill at speeds of approx 3 - 3.5 mph, but the pace of the video is approx 1.5 - 2 mph ....very slow. So I was quite dissapointed and feel the name of the video is very deceiving. I wish they would come out with videos that list the speed of the walker shooting the video or what level this is intended for. I would rate it as an entry level leisure walk."
2,uninspired,I down loaded this video from amazon instant video thinking I would use this with my stationary bike but it has poor video quality and went very slow. Slower than a walking pace. There was no preview clip. If there had been I wouldn't have bought it
5,As good on CD as it was live,"As one of the audience members for the taping of this CD, I can surely say that FIF sounds true to form on this recording. I was so impressed with the sound quality and the vocal clarity. FIF keeps you laughing with their silliness and expresses their faith openly. Its only too bad that the average listener would never know that they all had on long wigs and spandex clothing like Stryper for the show. That was a real treat!"
5,"I don't like Canada, but I do like this album","To be honest I was never bothered getting into Five IronFrenzy, I figured why bother. But I was on a road trip with a friendand he popped this into the CD player and I was laughing my foot off. These guys are funny the songs are tight, and the little speeches in between songs are hillarious, I especially like Recieve Him, cause my mom is proud of me becuase of the way I dress to."
4,Five Iron,This is an excellent example of the energetic shows that FIF puts on. I have attended one and this is the nearest you can come without being there. A great collection of their best songs
5,FiF ROX. nuf sed,"upbeats and beatdowns - rockedour newest album ever - rockedquantity is job #1 - these are not my pants!proof that the youth r revolting - the best EVER!this album is SO the best. the out-takes are SO funny! reese is a total nutcase! the fold out poaster rox! hey, even the plastic case that it comes in is cool! SO GO OUT AND BUY IT WHY DON'T YOU! <><"
3,"Solid ""Proof"" from FIF","Keep it coming! This is my second FIF CD (my first was ""Our Newest...""), and I even make a guest appearance in it (kind of). FIF made this album during the 99 Fest Season, and I saw them at Creation East. A couple of the songs are notably faster than the studio version (Oh Canada in particular). If you listen, you can also detect a few changes from the originals...In ""Superpowers"", instead of asking ""does he have a girlfriend yet?"" they ask ""does she have a boyfriend yet?"" and in ""Oh Canada"": ""William Shatner, Captain Kirk,'s a Citizen"" instead of ""William Shatner is a native citizen"". One of my favorites is ""It's Not Unusual"", originally from Tom Jones (I think). The only thing keeping me from serving up 5 stars, is that in the fun of the concert, they get a little squeally in the breaks between songs. After a while it gets old, but other than that, it's great...especially if you were there for the recording--look for yourself on the reverse side of the poster."
5,My mom's proud of me because of the way i dress,"Maybe i'm crazy. Maybe i've gone completly insane,but i LOVE this album. FIF is my favorite band,and they always manage to impress me. I bought this CD last year,and i love it still. The songs are live,so the fun,the silliness,and the worshipful moments are all captured beautifully. I have seen FIF in concert only twice,and i hope to see them many,many times more. i am so impressed at them,because they aren't sell outs,and they haven't compromised their faith. They have made me laugh,smile,cry,and laugh some more. My favorite songs of this album are One Girl Army,Every New Day,Blue Comb '78,and A Flowery Song. i recommend this album to EVERYONE. it is simply the best."
5,A great live album,"Five Iron Frenzy rules! The are so musically talented! Anyway, this live album rocks, go out and get it! This is some of the best christian/punk/ska music you'll ever hear. One thing that I would like to point out is that Five Iron Frenzy pulls off incorporating Christianity in their music better than most bands out there. Another thing is that their music is happy, rather than dark and depressing like other music out there today. More about this album, the musicians themselves are really funny! Which makes the album all the more enjoyable. Where the Zero Meets Fifteen and Every New Day have got to be my favorite songs on the whole album. But anyway, this CD is awesome, so you should go check it out."
5,Great fit to water bottles,I use the 24 oz. polar insulated bottles with these cages and I was very happy to see that they fit really snug. I haven't lost a bottle yet and I just completed Battenkill - a tough course full of gravel and potholes. Great cages.
5,blackburn camber cf bottle cage,"Very well made bottle cage. Holds bottles very secure but not too tight.Bottle go in and come out well, and i have no fear of a bottle coming out.looks great and works awesome."
4,So far so good,Installation was very easy. I replaced my old cage due to wear and tear. I tend to use 2 different size bottles depending on my distance. The cage has held both sizes very well and they are easy to pull out and replace
5,Blackburn makes great products.,You weight-weenies need this cage. Easy in/out but has a solid hold of your bottle. Super light and looks great...you know you want it.
3,Like a Milky Way Candy Bar but With Peanuts!,"Snickers Candy Bars are good, they are like Milky Way Candy Bars in that it has chocolate and caramel but unlike a Milky Way a Snickers bar has peanuts and lots of them too. I prefer Milky Ways but Snickers are good too and I recommend these to people who like their candy bars to have lots of peanuts in them."
1,Too Many Peanuts!,I know I will probably get slammed for saying this considering how popular Snickers Bar are but I really don't care for Snickers. I'm really don't like peanuts in my chocolate candy bars and I just find the peanuts to be too dry and that is why I prefer a Milky Way or Three Musketeers.
5,Easy travel skit.,"I took this skirt to Italy where you can't where bermudas in the churches. So, I carried it with me and slipped into it everytime I went into a place I had to wear long pants or a skirt. Doesn't wrinkle easy at all and with the buttons down the front, it was easy to step into. Highly recommend."
5,Erika Higgins gives this album the extra twist it needed,"This disk was recomended to my by a DJ working in a record store in UK. I definetely recommend this album. Spin is absolutely the best song on the album, featuring Erika Higgins."
1,Expensive Doorstop!,"I've had mine for several years. It worked for maybe 3-4 months and then it blue-screened my laptop and it hasn't worked since. I thought it was my laptop, so tried it on a new Sony laptop. Dead. Contacted customer support, who had me try several things and then concluded that it was an ""interrupt problem"" with my firewire port, suggesting I change the interrupt. Not gonna risk messing up my primary work laptop so I didn't go there. Then got a brand new MacBook Pro, figuring it has to work on a Mac. Dead as a doornail, even the Mac OS wouldn't recognize it. All it does is blink, showing that it is getting power.It's easy to blame problems on the software, on configuration, on the laptop for months and months until the thing is out of warranty and then find out it was the interface all along. Now it's just a very expensive ($500 back when I bought it) doorstop."
1,i HATE IT,"1- sound quality SUCKS (duh...)2- many plug ins they dont work on pro tools m-powered3- took me about 4 months to complete the buggy initial set up of this junk box,4- when its operating normal the sound would just stop all of a sudden (you'll have to restart your PC )DON'T BUY IT"
1,worst box ever!!!,"I've owned the 410 for a few years now and I don't think it's ever worked 100%. Numerous live shows have almost been canceled due this temperamental little beast. I would not wish this thing on my worst enemy! I recommend the RME Fireface series, they're expensive but worth it, totally professional, never had a problem."
3,Needed the instruction manual,We need the instruction manual for this product and we had to order cables separately. It is not working with ProTools!
1,Piece of Crap,"Any one who rates this interface higher than a 2 star certainly works for M-Audio. Configuring the system with the ""latest"" drivers from the M-Audio website has proved to be a nightmarish experience.Buy this at your own risk if after seeing all the negative comments you still are not convinced."
1,"terrible compatibility problems, terrible support","m-audio does not have forums on their site.there is a reason. their drivers are unreliable and highly incompatible.absolutely refuse to provide any documentation nor do they accept returns.if you value the stability of your computer, stay clear. stay well clear"
1,$300 blinking light,"The product worked decently for about 3 months. The mic inputs never sounded great. Suddenly, for no reason, it stopped initializing on startup. Now the extremely bright LED light just blinks. While this is good for party time in the computer room it is not good for recording songs. Buy something more reliable."
5,Works Great,"I have worked on ProTools HD for 6 years at a studio. I needed something at home that was small yet flexible. So, I bought ProTools M-Powered with a M-Audio Firewire 410. It is small yet still really flexible. There is a little latency with my setup, I think it is more computer related, but if you know what you are doing it is not a problem."
1,Be careful,If you buy the FireWire 410 - be warned that the device is not a hot swappable firewire compliant device. If you unplug it while your computer is on you stand the chance of damaging your firewire port. I blew out mine while trying to initially install it. I would definately recomend staying away from this product.
1,Unreliable.,"I got this interface to play live shows with my synthpop group. I've used plenty of other recording interfaces and fixed countless problems with them, but the problems with this interface seem to be unfixable.The audio skips and crackles. Sometimes the unit will stop working in the middle of a performance. I have to restart the computer to fix it.I haven't heard of this problem anywhere else, but mine buzzes loudly every time my laptop accesses the hard drive.It looks like some people don't have problems with this interface, but it's definitely a gamble. This is the only piece of M-Audio equipment I've ever had a problem with."
1,"Pop, pop, pop!!!!!!","I wish that was the title of a new song I had just recorded but it is not. It is the sound that I continue to get, on this week long recording sesion, I was doing. I could not understand what the problem was. Now I have to do it all over again, I am ticked off, and about to go and give an earfull to the folks who sold me this piece."
2,good card when it works,"I got this card about 2 weeks ago, to use with music software. I use mostly Protools M-powered and Finale. The card is excellent when it works, but it is the buggiest hardware I have ever used. Sometimes it does not turn on when I start the computer. This requires shutting down, unplugging everything from the card, and restarting the computer. There are alot of excellent cards out there, I would recomend getting a different one than this."
1,A NOT GOOD SELLER.,"I NEVER GOT MY PRODUCT M-Audio FireWire 410 4-In / 10-Out FireWire Mobile Recording , I PAID EXPEDITED SHIP , I WROTE TO Garrick2007, NEVER AWNSERED ME AND I DONT WANT THIS SELLER ON AMAZON WEB PAGE , IT IS NOT A SERIUS SELLER....I WILL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN..."
5,We love it!,"We saw a Bill Harley concert and quickly purchased this CD. Harley's music is very fun to listen to and my sons both sing the songs over and over. They really like ""Monsters in the Bathroom"", ""You're not the Boss of Me"", ""Dad Threw the TV our the Window"" and You're in Trouble."" This CD is a MUST for all of our road trips. It's really great."
1,A COMPLETE waste of money...,I bought this and quickly threw it away. These cartoon very VERY old. They are cartoons I do not remember and I love to watch cartoons. They are not in the classic looney tune style. I beg you not to waste your money on this DVD. I'm sure you could probably download it free somewhere online.
2,Not that great,I have had several that were better quality and less expensive. Thought it would be good because it cost more but it wasn't. Flimsy and feet were not quite aligned.
5,This book is extremely well written!,"This book truely answered all of my questions about credit and then went into suggestions that I could understand and implement. My credit is now perfect with a credit score of over 750. You will learn that scores over 700 are considered ""A"" credit. You will also see the importance of paying off high interest debt first. It sounds so simple but many people, like myself, were paying more on our mortgage while still carrying a credit card balance. This book has changed my family into knowledgable consumers. We are now debt free and I would strongly recommend it to anyone- and no, I don't know the author."
4,Even Christians Can Rock; D&K present a vital message.,"I bought this in July 1993 and have really grown attached to this CD. The message of new life in Jesus shines clearly in all of the lyrics, the songs are well produced and the band works together like a precision machine. 'God Good, Devil Bad' is a highlight, as are 'Never Look Back' and 'Soldiers of the Cross.'I can almost detect a bit of Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore here, so any Deep Purple fans out there might want to give this a listen. I saw D&K; live at a show in Tulsa in the fall of 1981 and was impressed; the only better live show I've seen was Eric Clapton in Hartford in 1985."
2,Crook of Credibility,"The two best parts of this book are the ending and the dust cover. Very disappointing considering the potential and the plot line. The main character of the book says at one point that it's time to take action. He's right, but, unfortunately about 150 pages late. This is a man who you want to cheer for, but who continues to love his wife insanely after she stabs him in the back to escape back to the cult and have the baby of the cult leader. This is also the man who can't tell the difference between a dream and a woman who comes to his bed in the middle of the night and makes love to him. Definitely wanted to generate more sympathy for him and at the same time feel more menace and suspense from the cult leaders and at the cult compound. But, somehow, they were just stolen from this book."
5,A very suspenseful read,"I got this book from the library today, and finished it today. I could not put it down for I wanted to see what happens next. The author introduces the reader to a whole different life that is unreal. I really enjoyed this book and could not put it down."
4,Surprisingly Good,"After reading the first Queer as Folk series book, I wasn't impressed. It didn't keep my attention and lacked greatly in detail. However, I highly anticipated the next book in the series, hoping it would be better than the first. I was pleasantly surprised after I read Never Tear us Apart. It had a captivating story line and I wasn't bored within five seconds of reading it. It delved depper into all of the characters and gave some insight into why the characters are like they are on the show. I reccomend this book to people who like good fiction and are fans of the show. Unlike with Every Nine Seconds, you won't be dissapointed."
4,Queer Continues...,"Like ""Every Nine Seconds,"" this latest installment in the younger lives of the Queer as Folk characters follows suit with the personalities and characteristics we love so much. It delves into the lives of the characters as they grow up together and meet one another in the first year of college. The author has done an excellent job in capturing the spirits of Michael, Brian, Lindsay, Emmett, and Deb. A must-read for any devoted Queer as Folk fan!"
2,Meet-Cute,"While the first novel was an easy read, this one is plodding and cloyingly cute, which seems to be the same malaise that hit the writing for the series itself. We have the origination of some speech and mannerisms of Brian, the meet-cute business of Emmett and Michael, the meet-even-cuter business - totally lacking originality - of Brian and Lindsay, who is busy dating a gay guy BEFORE she meets Brian, proving she's a one-trick pony. This is all so dull and predictable - and yet outlandish - that it's a poor man's soap opera. It's like the author used a check list to configure the thing! Fans who are still satisfied with the writing of the series after its aired three seasons will find it passable."
5,Taurus 1999,"My son's 1999 Ford Taurus sounded like junk when we purchased the vehicle. I have dealt with the muffler guy that we purchased this muffler from for 10 years and this is what he recommended. The Superturbo sounds great. I always doubt the performance numbers that the companies claim, but if nothing else the sound is GREAT!!. My boy is happy and it really does sound great."
4,SPOKO POLSKI/AMERIKANY,"THIS CD IS TIGHT, HE HAS THE BEAT AND HE GETS OFF SPITTIN ENGLISH. THIS IS A OLDER CD, I THINK HE SHOULD PUT OUT ANOTHER CD WITH SOME ENGLISH. IM SURE IT HAS IMPROVED, AS THE BEATS DID. MAD PROPS TO MY POLISH BOYS. CZESC."
1,Huj z Liroyem,"Liroy nierepresentuje polsky hip-hop bo sie odol swoj talent dla kasy. Wzgorze-Ya-Pa 3, onnie so pierwsa prawdziwa grupa hip-hopowa ktora do dzisaj representuja rapF*ck Liroy"
4,Persevere,"Kunjed Gyalpo or All Creating King (here rendered as Supreme Source) is an important Dzogchen Semde (mind series) tantra. At times the reading can be tough going, the text is deep and extremely repetitive, but that is the point! The use of repetition and the momentum of the text creates a mesmerising quality that left me buzzing.The one main drawback of this book concerns the double translation (from Tibetan to Italian to English). In a few instances, passages make no sense at all. But to be fair these are few and far between and do not detract from the overall meaning being conveyed. Also a glossary would have been most helpful as there are quite a number of technical terms and Tibetan phrases throughout the book.Allow yourself time to savour this work, persevere and read with care and you will be rewarded."
1,Public information for sale,"60% of this book is a rehash of information publicly available for all to see on the web. The balance is made up of some observations of the relative utility of candle work and other operations. The problem with this book is that you can buy an Anna Riva book (Not that I am suggesting that is a substitute) that is reasonably close in content for $5. But then again, you wouldn't get the fancy cover. I bought it and reviewed it and dropped into my ""Second tier"" books. The herbal and magickal formulary used in this book is all over the web. Buying it for the high price is not worth it in my view. The only justification for buying this book is if you have no clue about the topic and are just beginning. Given the cover it appears to be designed for that crowd."
3,repetitive,"I ordered this book based on the reviews in my 2006 wiccan calender. i was disappointed, as this book was praised as the ""best"". i have many other books on this topic, yet it sounded intriguing, so i thought i would try it. it was repetitive as well as containing basic information, that are already included in the other books i have. i sent it back. if you are a first timer, it would be a good one to have. but for those who are seasoned, i would avoid it."
5,Chinese Review and Enhancement,"After studying Chinese for over a year using pinyin, without learning to write Hanzi, I decided to start over with Integrated Chinese and learn to write Chinese characters. This book not only was a great review, but I was actually able to learn to write Hanzi quickly using this text. At the same time, audio related to the text has helped me learn to hear spoken Chinese much better. I am now working on Part 2, Level 1 which as a natural sequel. As in using any text, learning a language takes dedication and daily work."
4,Integrated Chinese: Level 1 - Unabridged Audio CD,"We'd ordered the Integrated Chinese Simplified Character Edition textbook and work book but apparently the Unabridged Audio CD that accompanies it is out of print with limited availability. Without the audio CD the workbook is useless. My attention stuck on the words 'limited availability'. If there is any way that we can purchase the audio CD, used or otherwise, we would be so grateful. Thank you very much, Laura"
1,Horrible,I would strongly discourage anyone from buying this book. The translations in the book are often very ambiguous and confusing. The book often presents new grammar without explaining it. For the grammar it does explain it gives very few example sentences. If you look at the authors they are all Chinese. Regardless of how well they may speak English many points are still lost in translation. When learning a language every small grammatical detail should be broken down and explained. This book will explain the main details but will leave you to figure the rest out on your own.
5,Dissapointed,"Y unfortunely ordered integrated chinese level 1 part 2. This was incorrect so I reordered level 1 part 1 which is what I needed. I immediately returned the first book, however with out sales slip which I had lost. The Kentucky office, where I was told to send it, held it for several weeks until the 30 days had expired. Yesterday I received the book back stating I had not purchased the book from them. I have used no one else besides Amazon,com. I also noticed my order had been taken out of the computer. I now have a book I cannot use nor do I want. Therefore please take my e-mail off your mailing list as I will not be ordering from you again. We start Chinese 1 and 2 june 12. All students will need new books but they will be advised not to buy from your company. I will try to find a place locally or elsewhere."
5,SOOO gooood!!,"I gave up diet coke last year. I drink water but it gets old after a while. I don't like sweet tea, but I do like to have a little flavor. This is has such a wonderful, light flavor. Even my kids like this tea! I've been stocking up so that I have plenty at all times!"
1,This book is Awful (and only 75 pages),"As someone who's been working in the business of privately placing securities for public companies, I can confidently say that this book is terrible!! Not only is this the most expensive 75 page book I've ever seen (only half of the pages have any text on them) but it's written for grade schoolers. This book assumes that you have ZERO understanding of finance. Of course, if you are new to finance, you probably don't want to read this book anyway....."
3,Good sweat but very repetitive,"This tape is a challenge. It got my heart beat up, I sweated and I felt good but this tape is also very repetitive. The same moves are done over and over and then Tamilee reverses her position on the step and does the same moves from the beginning all over again! This a great tape for someone who is familiar with the step and more advanced than begiiner but beware that the same moves are done over and over and can lead to boredom."
1,unable to see clearly,"I received this VHS and put it in my player, and I could barely see it. It was incredibly fuzzy--very poor quality. I didn't bother to return it since it was just a dollar, but I can't use it. I was really disappointed."
1,After a month this product broke,The side rechargeable battery part became lose with no repair. I should have not waited so many months before I gave it to my daughter b/c once it broke it was past the warranty period to get a replacement or refund. This is JUNK! The folks at Mobi have the worst customer service.
2,Incredibly slow book,"It is hard to improve upon the review by Kenneth R. Bridges. I will add that it is not until 100 pages into the book that anything happens: an act of sabotage. I do like Stephen Baxter. I loved ""Manifold Time"" and liked ""Manifold Space."" But ""Anti-Ice"" is maddeningly slow.Manifold: Timehas one of the most imaginative characters ever created in science fiction: Sheena 5, the intelligent squid. Baxter is talented, but this book is a dud."
5,"A fun, exciting, Vernian alternate history.","This is the novel Jules Verne might have written, if he'd suspected the possibility of nuclear energy,and been able to write interesting, likeablecharacters.Set in the 19th century, the novel concerns theeffects of the discovery of ""Anti-Ice"", a substancewhich is inert when frozen, but when heatedreleases colossal energies. It can be used as anenergy source for fantastic Vernian vessels, suchas luxury liners, trains and spaceships, or as acity-destroying explosive.An adventure story, ""Anti-Ice"" follows the fortunesof young Ned Vicars of the foreign office, whomeets explorer/inventor Josiah Traveller and iswhisked off into fantastic and horrible adventuresand romance.The novel also features some typically Verniandescriptions and explanations of a variety of craftand devices which employ anti-Ice."
3,Not sure if I'll buy these again...at least not online.,"I started taking these after I ended a detox/cleansing program from the same maker that left me constipated for whatever reason. These are supposed to be good for the digestive system. I have been taking 2 per day (the max recommended dose). I'm not constipated anymore but it's not like I feel great and I can say ""yes, this is really helping my digestive system"". It may be that it will help me in the long run and I just don't notice anything spectacular right away. Kinda hard to tell. The real issue I have with these pills is that it says right on the package ""keep refrigerated or frozen"" yet these came to me in a cardboard box via mail, in the heat, and took 3-4 days to be delivered. Since these are ""live cultures"" shouldn't they be mailed perhaps with dry ice or something to keep them in the cool?"
3,The lid is flimsy,"The carafe is wonderful with the coffeepot. The only problem is if the lid is removed to put the carafe in the dishwasher, the prongs that hold the lid on are poorly made and break off."
3,Not very bright,"Got these bulbs since they are reasonably priced, and I have been quite happy with Hella products in the past. Each bulb is packaged in a thin paper box with no cushion whatsoever. So be very careful not to drop them or touch the bulb with your finger when you open the box. For 100W bulbs, I expected it to be much brighter. But the sad truth is that the output light seems slightly dimmer than the 65W 5500K Korea made bulbs that it replaced. I only hope that the longevity of these bulbs will be better than the Korean ones. Otherwise it will be a complete waste of money."
1,Junk. Don't buy,"They don't look bright white. They actually look like the cheep blue head lights you see kids rolling around with. They are supposed to be brighter than stock head lamps, but they are actually dimmer and annoyingly blue."
1,WARNING. DO NOT BUY THIS,"I have been interested in astronomy for about 9 months. I own one of the best telescopes, a Celestron Nexster 11 and do reasearch on variable stars and measuere double stars, so I know whats a good instrument and whats not. This is whats not.while very little can perform up to the grade of my telescope opticly and mechanicly, this can not even perform to my 50mm finder. Optics are horrible, or at least the eyepieses are, and the say this thing can magnify 800x. Right there is an indicator how bad it is. Never use magnification as a spec. I dont think that this could perform well at 30x. Let alone 800x. The mount is also terribly wobbly. DO NOT BUY THIS."
3,Fit of 2(x)ist Men's Essential Contour Pouch Brief,The manufacture of this brief has changed from same product ordered last year. The product is smaller and has a tighter fit. If you are considering this item I recommend that you consider the 2(x)ist Men's Pima Contour Pouch Brief because it fits better.
2,They're changed the cut/fit for the worse,"I usually love this underwear and have purchased many pairs over the years. I was very disappointed with theses because they've modified the cut/fit and now they are very uncomfortable. They're called the Contour Pouch because there's suppose to be a pouch to give your privates room. The new cut cuts out the pouch so your privates get crammed between your legs, not a good thing."
2,Not my favorite,"I bought this pair in order to replace boxer/briefs, but this pair disappointed me to a great extent. The pouch is a neat idea but still constricts my anatomy, and even more so than any other pair of underwear that I have tried before. I will be going back to my Fruit of the Looms after this review.The material seems nice and of good quality."
2,Smashed My Man Bits,"These undies are a little too tight in the groin area. These things fit so snug that I was only able to wear them for a few minutes before having to take them off again. However, I have already found some undies that fit me perfectly and have ample room for my man parts:Calvin Klein Men's Trunk Fashion"
3,Not What I Expected,"Doesn't fit very well on me and not exactly the style I was looking for. And of course you can't return them after you try them on. For me, they're okay, but wouldn't order them again."
5,Bought again,"Comfort, fit, durability and all I could ask for in under wear. This is the second or third time I bought this product, and probably will do so again. They are a bit expensive, but until I find the same quality cheaper, I will stick with them. Prompt delivery as promised."
3,Too many errors,"I'm studying for my third PA recertification exam and thought this would be a good tool to use. Unfortunately, this book has lots of mistakes, leaving me questioning what I know is correct. It has a great layout, is easy to read, and has nice summaries for each topic. But if you're unsure of the accuracy of the information, you end up going to other sources to study, which is double the work."
2,You can do better for step 3/for FP boards OK,get nms questions and strong medicine for step 3this is way out of date and does not even cover the topics tested on step 3 let alone ccs
4,Nice broiler pan,"Despite what's said in another review, this pan is the size promised in the product guide on the buying page: 16.5 x 12.8 x 1.8 inches. The size and composition are fine. Hard to get excited about a broiler pan, but this one does the job nicely. Bottom is useful for roasting a small turkey or roast, also."
5,"Wonderful, thought-provoking stories by a Unique Individual","The characters in each of the stories in this book are so real that sometimes it is frightening, but in the very best way. I was completely engrossed (shocked, touched, amazed) by each tale. I discovered Jenny's writing after taking a Creative Writing course under her tutelage at a university in upstate New York. On the last day of class she let us read ""Touched."" I read it the first time, and thought it was good. I read it again a few months later, understood it much better and thought it was great. I then proceeded to read the rest of the stories and was completely amazed. (I think if I had read these stories *before* I took the class, I would have been too intimidated to let her see my own writing.) This is a terrific group of stories, and I wish I could read some more of her writing."
3,It's... Ok.,"The bowls are a heavy duty plastic, but I'd I think they're too small to do much with... except if you like small dishes for ice cream. It really is 4"" x 2"" x 2"", get a ruler and see for yourself how small that is before you go ahead and order. Other than that, they are quality and have no visible flaws. I plan on using these for cat dishes, so I'm pleased with them for my use."
2,2 stars,"At first, it would seem Bianca Balducci's worst problem is fried hair as a result of a curly perm gone bad. As anyone who has undergone this will tell you, that's bad enough. Things rapidly get worse as she lands in the middle of a feud between two friends and the feeling that her boyfriend is drifting away. Beyond the usual teen woes are bigger issues. Her sister, a PI, is on the trail of an art forger, and it would seem that at least one of the suspects is all too close to one of Bianca's friends. That makes it her business as well, so Bianca goes on the case.** This book relies heavily on knowledge of the first book in establishing the characters. Thus, if you don't remember it well, it will be difficult to relate to them now. It is light, amusing, and very real, and Bianca is a good role model for young women. **Amanda Killgore"
4,one of the best goth groups ever,"Closterkeller's 4th album for me is one of their best (second after ""Blue""). Anja Orthodox good as always. As I remember ""Scarlet"" & ""Owoce wschodu"" were quite big hits few years ago. Really worth buying."
1,Lost in space,"I never received it!!! When I try to track it it was delivered, but nobody has it and it was supposedly delivered 3 weeks after it shipped. Records say they shipped to wrong address. I don't know who has it but I sure don't.I won't order from amazon again."
1,did not love,"I appreciate ""off-the beaten path"" exploring, but this did not make me want to go to Fiji. It is a dream of my husbands. I guess we will be sticking to the resorts."
5,Yum!,This chocolate is very rich and creamy. It was a big hit at the party. The nice thing is that you don't have to go to the trouble of melting the chocolate (especially if you aren't around a kitchen). Very easy to use. Expect to use a lot of this chocolate (it goes fast). The container leaked a little but it was wrapped up pretty good so I didn't lose much. It is a good investment for the quality.
3,Easy but not elegant,"I bought this fountain to do Chocolate Fantasy at work and at campouts. I also purchased the Sephora chocolate specifically for fountains. It was all easy to put together, easy to use, but I never got the full cascade effect like is pictured. Actually it was easier to dip into the bottom bowl than to let the chocolate drizzle on the fruit/pretzels.Clean-up is HUGE - very messy getting it apart. Nice that it fits in the dishwaser but you really have to clean it prior to putting it in there.I would not purchase this again."
5,Awesome!,"Awesome chocolate, easy to use, pour, eat and everything- so worth the money- don't mix your own- just buy this already done!"
3,Liquid Chocolate,"When I purchased this product is was because of the convenience of not having to melt chips. I was using it away from home and access to all kitchen appliance needed. It worked for convenience, the taste was great, but the chocolate was bit thick....I was not able to use it in my fountain."
2,CHOCALATE FOUNTAIN,I FOUND THE MAACHINE A LITTLE HARD TO CLEAN OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS FINE FAST SHIPPING NICE PACKAGE GREAT FOR PARTYS
2,Dont expect much from this product,Have to take at least 3 capsules to equal 1 lactaid pill. Not that effective either. Not the best choice on the market.
4,They work,"At about half the price of other lactose intolerance meds, these seeem to work just fine. I can have my pizza with extra cheese again."
1,Not enough info,They do not state what the FCC units are so you can't tell if this is a good deal or not...
1,Not as good as Lactaid,"It's my experience that this product is not as effective as Lactaid. Whereas I was taking 1 Lactaid pill per occurance, I required the recomended dose of 3 capsules for this product to be effective."
3,Do I have a choice?,I am still trying to decide if they work. I still get stomach rumbles when eating allegedly lactose free milk products while taking these pills.
2,Wrong dosage,"Lactose supplement medications seem to come in two strengths: effectively take one at a time or take three at a time. So far as I can tell none of the various lactose supplement products on Amazon actually state the strength/dosage. I guessed wrong on this one, expecting the one at a time version. At three per meal, it turned out a good bit more expensive per dose than the locally-available Target or Rite-Aid house brands."
2,Serving information,"It's not as cost-efficient as I thought it would be. What drew me to it was the price and the quantity. Now that I see the actual product, it says you're supposed to take 3 capsules prior to ingesting dairy or other meals with milk. Not happy about that. I just hope it's effective, since I'm already taking three, it might just work, right?!"
3,"Ok, but I won't buy again.",Not as comfortable as other Sketcher shoes I have bought. These shoes are not the most comfortable and don't seem to wear as well. Maybe it is just this one pair because I ALWAYS buy Sketchers.
5,Great Little League Fundamentals!,"Some excellent and dynamic drills are used to get basic Little League fielding fundamentals across to players. Should players always be taught to catch with two hands? Why do fielders tag baserunners who slide on the thigh instead of the foot? These and other fielding skills are explored and explained for coaches and parents. As is the case with young players, practice and repetition are the keys to success and FIELDING DRILLS & TECHNIQUES point you in the right direction."
5,Will Elevate Your Baseball Teams' Game!,"FIELDING DRILLS & TECHNIQUES is a right to the point DVD that does not mince words or baseball fundamentals. The explanations are clear and this product tackles many different defensive situations that come up in games.Our 11 & 12 year old team was diligent in practicing a lot of the drills with the techniques shown and they seem to work well. Logical answers abound in this program. Listen to this coach. He seems to have a wonderfulgrasp on youth sports.Baseball glove, $75.00.Baseball bat, $100.00.This DVD, PRICELESS!"
2,not quite blasted,"While there are tons of memorable riffs off the previous album comp. dehumanized, after listening to this album through, not one part really stays with me. I may have been distracted by movie samples. It's angry though, I'll give it that. Rock on!"
1,This thing made too much noise and didn't clean my windshield.,"I have a 2001 Saturn L300 and I saw the reviews on this windshield wiper so I gave it a try....it was AWFUL. It left HUGE streaks across my winshield and made too much noise, like it was rubbing against my windshield rather than gliding across it."
3,Probably adequate if you put in the time,"I stopped using iListen after a few weeks because it was just too hard to make it work accurately. I get the sense that if I put in more time to correcting mistakes that it made or reading to it more to improve it's accuracy, I would like the results better. But, it processed words so slowly on my 867 mhz laptop that I found it easier to type."
1,Doesn't work,"I bought iListen 1.7 for Mac OS X and it has been completely useless. Not only have I not been able to get it to work, I paid a tech service almost as much as the software costs to help me get it working. They couldn't do it either. I resorted to paying for tech support because iListen tech support is only online and useless as well. They send multi-page emails with detailed actions, most of which I'd already taken, and they make excuses such as that voice recognition software is highly complex technology. They suggested that I buy another usb connector because iListen apparently doesn't work with the more recent versions of Mac OS X. I note that there is no mention of that in their ads. I bought the usb connector for the Plantronics mike because I didn't want to downgrade my OS. Again, it was useless. Even recording myself counting produces gibberish, and I have done professional voiceovers for training films, so I know my voice records well. What a waste of money!"
1,iListen didn't iHear what iHad to say!,"After purchasing the software version 7, I downloaded the upgrade to version 8. No documentation came in the box, one must also download a PDF from their website. Documentation for the latest version was NOT available from their website. After exhaustive hours of training the software with no results, I emailed the company asking for more specific instructions for recognizing WAV files. Over a month later, I still haven't received a response. I found this product to be completely useless."
2,Poor performance for my son,I got iListen to help my son with a learning disability speed up his writing. The system seems to be unable to understand his 10-year old voice. I'm going to try training it again but he's pretty tired of reading (not his strong suit) aloud into the microphone over and over.
2,"OK, I guess","This is mostly a listing of the hunderd tree species that are recommended for planting in Texas gardens. Usually per tree there is one page, of which more than half will be devoted to pictures (some trees rate two pages). Printing quality is good with full color photographs throughout.The information given appears in order (I only browsed through). Picture quality is only so-so. We live in an age of splendid photography, and there are plenty of tree books with pictures of a Wow! quality. The pictures in this book fall well short of such a standard. It looks to be mostly a matter of composition.I guess this book is OK, but I see no reason for enthousiasm."
1,Not worth it,"It is not a foaming gel, so that it irritated my skin. I will never buy not foaming gel anymore. However, the fragrance is very nice."
2,Suck,"My mother-in-law found these on sale at JCPenney. We were so excited since they were supposed to be a really good brand of pots and pans... The little metal bowls rusted after one use when used as dog dishes. The first time I used the larger skillet, I had it warmed up and tossed on some cold meat. The pan itself curled up like a tortilla, then uncurled most of the way. It's still warped though. I haven't tested it on the little skillet since I like it, but I use the larger skillet for 70% of my cooking. The pans cook way hotter than any pans I've ever had, so I burned a lot of things until I figured them out. The hollow handles also get very hot quickly, so you have to use a potholder for what you're cooking.I would really rather have some thick stainless steel Chefmate pots and pans like my sister has."
3,OK for small family,"Its complete set for small family .I felt sauce pans ok for 3 people family but not useful for parties (10 people parties)They would have given one large frying pan instead of these many small spoons ,utensils ,pans . May be i chose wrong set for my needsThey gave steel spatulas which should not be used in these vessels as they told .I am not comfortable making fry(dishes) because they stick to bottom .To avoid this we have to use lot of oil which we can't do for health reasonsOther wise its is good for small family .Its complete set for small family .it includes measuring cups colander which are useful .Nothing is free.It's only worth of $49.99 .Don't expect more than that .."
1,Too small to be any use.,For the money you would expect to get a blanket you could at least lay over a standard bed. The shape is really very stupid it is way too long and to narrow to be of use for the average guy. Even on a standard bed it would be only good for one person and even then if they were skinny.Don't waste you money.
4,Ok,"I liked this book,I am eagerly awaiting the next ,and I'm a big R.E.F. fan,but I was disappointed that Rage of a Daemon King basically says all the other books are lies this is the truth. I think he destroyed the the previous books for any readers who read this book first."
4,"Must finish the series, expectably good","How do you rate a book when it is the last in a series of great book. It was not as great as the others, but still very good. A must read, although I was a little lost at the end with all the different kinds of magic, paths, gods and demi-gods floating around."
5,LOVED IT!!,"This book is about 1 million times better than ""Rise of a Merchent Prince"" a book that I little actually dislike but will not re-read agian either.In this book preety much everything pays off from the first two books we have a lot of conflict on all fronts and while some of it doesn't get wrapped up smothly it all comes to more than a satisfactory conclusion. At a point this book is just one drawn out slugging match with the forces of the Emerald Queen.Everyone who has possibly even remotly been in a Feist serise of books has a part to play and for the most part this works out really well.My favorite sequence in the whole book is the conversation between Duke James and the leader of the Thives Guild. This is a book that I will gladly rwead agian.Overall-Took a while to get going but in the end it packs quite a punch."
4,Fun read!,"Really enjoy just about everything that Feist has ever written, and this entry is no exception. Feist really is a master of characters and of world-making."
5,Superior!,"Raymond Feist is one of the greatest fantasy writers of alltime, in my judgment. I especially enjoyed his Serpentwar Saga,which began with SHADOW OF A DARK QUEEN. The latest book in this series is RAGE OF A DEMON KING. This series chronicles the lives of two boyhood friends, who went from being convicts to playing preeminent roles in saving the Kingdom from utter destruction. This series is very engrossing and transports you into the Principality of Krondor, and into the lives of the characters. I would recommend that anyone who likes books from the fantasy genre to read this series, though you may want to read the Riftwar Saga by Feist first in order to get background information.A masterful work!"
3,Feist gets bloody,"I give Rage of a Demon King very mixed reviews. The well-loved characters get further developed - well Eric does. Roo suffers a bit. However, the book is all blood, guts, and destruction with a few gags thrown in. More worthy of a special effects/action movie than a Feist novel. Worth reading to follow the story and hopefully it leaves a clean slate for the next volume"
2,YOU MUST BE JOKING,"OK. I loved the Rift War saga, so I do enjoy reading works bythis authour. But I think Feist has fallen to that most dreadeddisease to which many successful authors succumb to, complacency. Damn, at times the man hardly seems interested enough in keeping the story moving. Give me a ******* break! Some of the very foundations on which the popularity of Midkemia are based on are torn down. Well, hopefully that he has now destroyed everything, and ""...all that remains is that which is a Sarth."" (shades of Silverthorn) he can now recreate this interesting little area of the world into something filled with the politcal intensity found in Princes of the Blood, the urgency found in Darkness at Sethanon and for **** sake the magic, wonder and sense of discovery we found when we picked up The Magician. MAN GO BACK TO THE FIRST FOUR NOVELS AND YOU DEFFINITELY CAN NOT GO WRONG."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Invasion preparation.Things are a bit worse than they seem as the Dark Queen is really a demon in disguise, and a large army is heading Erik's way as he desperately tries to train enough men to do something about it.Roo is involved in high level economic issues, and even more importantly on the magic front, Pug and Tomas have to find Macros the Black if they are going to have any hope of stopping what is coming to Sethanon and the Lifestone."
5,The death of all life or salvation for all,"By: Trent VolkmanAn army from across the sea, a demon king, a war of massive perportions.This is Fiests third installment of the serpent war saga a 4 book series. It tells the story of Erick Von Darkmoor and his life training the many raw recruits for the special fighting force the crimson eagles. The story of Rupert Avery as he clashes with the mighty merchant Jacob Esterbrook and his seductive daughter Silvia for control over trade to Kesh. This also speaks about the magician Pugs part in this he is combating the mysterious third player Nalar the mad god of evil. My favorite part in this book is when the Marcos the black, magician, fights the demon king Maarg.The theme of this book could be considered protect your heart don't give it away to anyone unless you know they are the right one for you. As far as I'm concerned this was a good book it had suspense, action, mystery, even a little romance everything a good novel needs."
3,"Great Book, some drawbacks, though.","Let me just start with saying this book was extremely imaginitive and very, very exciting. However, the one thing I disliked was how it in a way cheapened the previous series, making all those occurences less important. Furthermore, there is a great deal of mystique taken away from characters and creatures such as Macros and the Valheru, beings who used to be a source of awe that are now to be viewed as either fakes or minor pawns. But, this is an excellent read, especially for those who love the series as much as I do."
2,What a let-down.,"The pros: There's a genuinely touching moment with James and Ghanima that takes place near the end of the Battle of Kronder. A wonderful piece of writing in that scene, certainly rare to see in a genre author, and one that seriously brought tears to my eyes.The cons: The rest of the book stinks.I can't believe Feist is the same author who gave us rounded, thoughtfully-developed characters in the Riftwar series.This thing is just a collection of dully-written action scenes separated by occasional conversations between characters who apparently all suffered from a personality-killing disease sometime after Rise of a Merchant Prince took place. You get the sense that Feist just wanted to get this book over with as quickly as possible.Worst of all, these isn't even a real resolution. You have the requisite Big Fight at the end, and then we're left hanging.Oh well, I guess even best-selling authors still have to make a living."
1,HAS MIDKEMIA BECOME MELROSE PLACE?,"MIRANDA SLEEPS WITH PUG...THEN CALIS..THEN PUG...BUT ALL THAT TIME, PUG KNOWS SHE'S SLEEPING WITH CALIS AND ACCEPTS IT! WHO IS THE SORCERER I USED TO KNOW SO WELL....I GUESS FEIST KILLED HIM AND REPLACED WITH A GENUINE LOSER."
2,audio version of rage of a demon king,"This particular audio version of a very good book is terrible. the story is chopped up, key charactors left out, and scenes mutilated. The story is hard to follow, and makes little sense."
3,Climax is not up to Feist Standards,"A fair fiction story by general comparison but a real letdown compared to Feist's other books, better to have left Pug out of it than depict him the way he did. Sexual adventures of Roo became monotonous, as did his name. Of course Feist has his work cut out for him after having written THE BEST SF/FANTASY CLIMAXES I HAVE EVER READ!!! But where are they in this series -- NOWHERE???"
1,TOTAL IDIOCY..AND THAT INCLUDES THE BOOK AS WELL AS FEIST,"Pug, the most powerful wizard in the known universe...throws a giant fireball that is reflected back by a sub-demon lord and almost kills him.....I quit"
4,A SAGA WORTH READING!!!,"Good storyline, but to many dead friend... Worse still, the bad guy doesn't even defeated. The heroes just plug it and wait until next time... what!!! Just like x-file, the enemy is out there... where? don't know. geezzz Overall it's okey... and I just love the twins, they bring back the memory of Jimmy the Hand. In future (I just know there will be new books of Shadow of the Nameles One)I hope that you can ask your publisher to send to Malaysia on time. Because last time the books arrive a little bit late. Raymond E. Feist please write new book soon... hope you add a new character."
3,Feist has definitely done better..,"While this book grabs and holds your attention, it is probably Feist's worst work. Other than a rather creative philisophical discussion about the origin of the universe, this book is mindless. It's almost as if Feist got bored of developing his characters and decided that he wanted to write 500 pages of non-stop war... which is fine as long as you create a story behind the war (which isn't there). This is the first book of Feist's that has disappointed me."
4,An overall thrilling read...,"Raymond Fiest returns to enchanting Midekemia with a novel ofErik and Roo, the two heroes who we have begun to love. Pug andMacros, along with Miranda, must thwart the efforts of the demons to enter Midekemia from Shila, the Sauur homeworld. The Emrald Queen's army begins its invasion of the Kingdom, and...... you'll just have to read it. Overall, this book is a sure winner"
4,Very wonderful book,"A great book for anyone thinking of per suing drag racing as hobby or going further, well written and explained, in simple terms to getting started, to safety equipment needed, car prep to taking off down the track!"
5,Crutches-Alum Youth,Exactly what I wanted and for far greater less of a cost than medical supply stores. Exact size needed and good quality; no damage in shipping. Thank you
2,I've had it for two years and it always irritates me!,"The big problem with this software is this:You CANNOT copy and paste from the articles--they are stored at image files, NOT as text files.Worse, if you try to print out the pages, the text is illegible. NG released a patch that would darken the text, but it didn't work--it darkens everything, so you just end up with a darker page.I am a teacher and I was hoping to be able to use the articles in class, but I have not been able to.I have had these CDs for more than two years and I have NEVER been able to use it in the way that I had hoped.In short, this product has been nothing but a waste of money for me."
2,This software is not produced properly.,"Like other reviewers, I found this set of CD ROM hard to use. Its quality of text and photo are poorly made. Worse, it may have some bugs in its program that I can only zoom to the point of full pages, no zoom in further. The print out is very bad too. So it is hard to read both on screen or on pages. I tried some later years, the quaility doesn't improve much.The program like to ask for registration but failed to log on to its server through my cable connection.By buying this set of CDR, I was hoping I can get something useful, but now, I have to find out a way that 'unlock' it photos like NG claimed to be one benefit of registration but I never was able to."
1,A Nice Wooden Box,"This is a decent program although I wouldn't have gotten it had I known the troubles I was going to have. The software is very outdated and does not have a nice presentation for the photos or articles. The big problem I've had, and still have, is that I'm unable to register by modem or mail. The software is designed to only search for dial-out connections and it doesn't recognize broadband. I have e-mailed and snail mailed out 2 copies of my registration form to the Mindscape software company and have gotten no reply. My best guess is that the product is no longer being made and no one will accept responsiblity for the copies still out in the stores. The best part about this program is I can store the CDs in the nice wooden box it came with."
1,Neat concept worthless execution,I was very excited about the product. I thought I would spend the next few years exploring the set. I find it impossible to use. It is like reading very poor photocopies of the magazine. the print quality is very poor and the photos are very grainy.On the bright side it looks great on my shelf gathering dust.What a major disappointment.
2,Just awful,"The software is not compatible with currently updated Quicktime, XP or my monitor. Can't even download. I backdoored some of the files and articles appear to be scanned, are fuzzy and disappointing. Cannot online register and the mail registration address is not valid. Very very worthless in my world."
2,It worked for a few years . . .,"I own the 108 Years set and enjoyed it while it lasted - until I upgraded to WinXP, then Vista. There are no upgrades available. According to their website (www.nationalgeographic.com/cdrom/complete/faq.html): ""The only way to have a complete and fully integrated product is to purchase the current full set, National Geographic 112 Years. We apologize for any inconvenience."". The paper version of their magazine still has a longer lifespan!"
2,Great idea; shabby execution,"Others have observed: the 31 CD set becomes like swapping floppies for a serious search result. Worse, this edition is now obsolete. Most users have operating systems that will no longer run the software on these CDs. It is difficult to adjust monitor resolutions for these scans. Text legibility is poor, and there is no way to capture anything.This collection cannot be considered an archival library investment. Computer technology obsoletes this collection; National Geo made no allowance to ""future proof"" this material. Instead, it seems they chose in favor of database protections and copy-proof schemes. When their database software cannot run on your system, the set becomes useless. Plan on buying a new set of DVDs about every five years to stay current with technology."
2,cannot use it in my PC.,"I bought this CD set and can't use it in my computer. The tech-support people of its manufacturer said that's because the CD was incompatible with my CPU (Cyrix MII). They said they knew this problem before and are trying to solve it. I don't know why they don't mention it in the ""system requirement"". So you'd better not risk buying it if you have a Cyrix CPU."
2,brand new generator and needed new engine?,"I bought this generator because it was a honda. well, i received it and it ran fine until I noticed a oil leak from the underside of the block. I took it into honda as told. they said it would be a week until they got the gaskets. a week goes by and it's still leaking!!! so, honda says i need new engine and it will be another week before they receive the new engine. i guess it was just a freak thing, but i'm still unhappy that i paid $560 for a new generator and i need it to wash clothes,lighting, water, living, and i'm without. i can't hack on amazon at all they were just the middleman. it's northern tool you got to watch!!!!"
3,Mystery lover,"If you love all things British, you'll probably enjoy these, but the series is dated and there are few subplots."
2,Boring Brits,"A lackluster production based on a great series. Hollywood did a much better job. In spite of some well known British actors, the series is boring and it appears that the director was bored or asleep and incapable of bringing any spark to his actors or the plots. Look for the old movies!"
4,"Raffles, the Master Cracksman","Saw this years ago, most likely on PBS, and it's stuck with me ever since. It's a lovely production, the sets and dialogue really draw you in and make you feel like you're in another decade.Unfortunately, my rating has to be 4 stars because ACORN didn't add subtitles, something that I thought all DVDs were supposed to have. I'm not hard-of-hearing, but sometimes the audio or a thick accent garbles a word and that takes away from the overall enjoyment of the experience.Still...If you want to have a good time with a likable scoundrel and his sidekick, I recommend RAFFLES. It's a wonderful way to while-away an afternoon, sipping tea and laughing at upper class high-jinks and impecunious young men inadvertently saving the day."
1,Not as described,"Despite the fact that the item was called ""Reflective Legbands"" (emphasis on the plural), I only received ONE legband. Furthermore, although I ordered the lime, I was sent the silver. For a $10, I can't be bothered to pay return shipping, so I guess I'm stuck with what I ordered.Check out this other item instead:Reflective Bands by Jog-A-Lite ( Pair)"
1,Skip this book and get the Huxfords' Guide,"I love all things Fiesta, but this book is terrible. My main complaint is the ""quality"" of the photographs. They are so grainy-- sort of clear but fuzzy at the same time. And the color is way off. I mistook several pictures of gray Fiestaware for lilac at first glance! So forget about his ""comparison"" of the greens because it will not help you. What gets me is that any crap digital camera would have done a better job but from the reflections in the dishes it looks like he had a professional shoot the pictures. By the way, I also completely ignored the text (even though it is in LARGE print), since the Huxfords' book and the HLCCA's book cover everything. The bottom line: don't waste your time or money."
4,Ultimate Collection,"This DVD collection is more of a show ""highlights"" disc- culling the best episodes from the run of the show. Those looking for a collection of the episodes as they were aired will not be satisfied with this DVD set."
5,Sonny and Cher,"What a blast from the past! Sonny's less than adequate singing, and Cher's Bob Mackey costumes. I had a wonderful time watching this DVD. Very nostalgic indeed!!"
4,I really enjoy this collection,I only wish I could buy more! These were definitely some of this shows best moments. Good investment of time and money. Any fan of this show will love it I think.
5,Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour Rocked,This is a great collection of shows. I hope that they release some more.
3,Sony & Cher is not a 'best of' collection,"I never realized how dated this variety show could be in its entirety. Carol Burnette had the right idea... Splice the BEST parts into 1/2 hour shows. Parts of these shows are really good but not entirely so. Cher's comments run about 5 minutes.This SHOULD have been ""The Best of Sonny & Cher, Volume One"""
3,Disappointment,"I am a huge Sonny and Cher fan and of course, rushed to buy this DVD collection from their much beloved TV show. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I cannot understand the reasoning behind the selection of shows included in this collection. The comedy sketches are decidedly NOT funny, given the passage of time and the change in popular tastes on the comedic scene. What would have been far preferable, would have been to have included ALL musical numbers performed by Sonny and Cher, and also by Cher alone. Ultimately this duo will be remembered for their music, not their comedy. Hopefully the creators of this DVD set will put out another collection of just the music...PLEASE!!"
2,Buyer Beware,"I purchased this DVD set and waited with great anticipation. However, the DVDs will not work on older model DVD players. I took the DVDs over to a friend's house who recently purchased a DVD player and DVDs worked fine. I had this issue once before with another DVD. So, if you do not want to purchase a new player and you have an older model player, I suggest you do not purchase the set. What a bummer!!"
5,Very comprehensive book,"This book is an excelent complement to panel data textbooks (such as Arellano's and Balthagi's) because it deals with problems generally encountered in microdata, such as sample selection."
1,Terrible cable,"Ghosting and static all day, every day. If you need a replacement cable, find one with better shielding."
4,Monitor Replacement Cable,I am very happy with the product and service was very prompt and reasonably priced.
1,Use on High Res LCD monitor,Terrible results. Scan line interference. Looked like steady stream of waves.
1,How bad can it be?,"I purchased one of these at Staples when the red and green stopped showing with my current monitor cable at a LAN party and needed one ASAP. I was using a 15"" LCD at 1024x768 and it could not display that low resolution without awful ghosting. I was a bit hesitent to purchase it becouse it looked flimsy compared to most monitor cables, but there were not any others available at the store. Needless to say I was very disappointed."
1,Avoid!,"I got this cable to use with a VGA switch. This cable creates terrible ghosting. Sure, it's cheap but you get what you paid for. I suggest paying a few bucks more and getting a better cable."
1,Ghosts!,I had the same results as everyone else--tons of ghosting. I couldn't even look at my monitor for more than a minute or two before my head felt like it'd explode. Go with any other brand than this.
3,You get what you pay for,"I wanted a cheap VGA cord that I can use for when I bring my work laptop home so I can hook up my monitor and have a dual display. When I plugged it in, the resolution was off pretty badly at first. So I switched this monitor cable with the ones my parents had for their computer....assuming they would enjoy the larger resolution since they are...well....older :-)A few days ago I was using their PC and I re-adjusted the resolution up a little so it looks much better. Maybe it just takes a few days to get the settings right?Though you get what you pay for. It does the job."
4,Prairie Vignettes review,"Having reviewed many books in my time,and being a native of South Dakota all my life, I found it to be a very true and heartwarming book. Prairie Vignettes brings back many memories of good old South Dakota. I strongly recommend this book to readers everywhere."
1,Great CD for Tai Chi. Rating change to 5 stars,Ihave just received this CD and it was worth the wait. I teach Tai Chi/Qigung and will recommend this to my students. It has a 1 min soft start on the 1st CD. This allows time for brief instruction before beginning movements. The transitions are smooth and does not distract from the Tai Chi flow. The artistry is first rate and as background I have not found any better. The length is perfect for a 1 hr class and ques me to wrap up each session. Strongly recommended for Tai Chi & Qigong. Jim
2,Not as good as they used to be,I used cutting oil to help blade life but only got 5 cuts across 26 inches on steel roofing panels. Used a second blade with same result. Blades used to outlast abrasive type. Not anymore!
4,House of Doolittle Planner - very pleased,This planner is exactly what I needed for planning the month. It is easy to read and is well made. I have really enjoyed using this planner.
4,Pretty good over all,"I have recently purcheased a Siemens S66 phone. This phone has mean nice features and a few draw backs. The first thing to notice is that it comes with bluetooth, InDR, and a 32 megabit scandisc card (for storing photos). The phone has a very large display and it isnt a flip phone. It is Tri-band functional, and gets service better then any other phone I have owned with a internal Antenna. One of the nicest things I have noticed is that you can actually see the screen just as well in direct sunlight as you can in the dark (major kudos in my book). The only draw back I have found is that they battery life isnt all it is cracked up 2 be and it weasn't untill I got a bluetooth headset that I was completely satisfied, a must have with any bluetooth cell phone."
3,"Good screen, cool games, average phone","This phone has lots of nice features: A nice large screen, a 1.3 megapixel camera, bluetooth, and good games(even worms).However, it was a bit bulkier than my Sony Ericsson T637, didn't have a significantly larger screen, and the bluetooth didn't work well with my headset. I don't think the voice quality on my bluetooth headset was quite as good either.I have seen pretty nice photos taken with the camera of this phone, but they show up on the LCD with lots of noise. And it crashed once while trying to take a photo in the less than one day I owned the camera.This was the first phone I've used which had games I wanted to play, including Worms. The size of the LCD made playing games a real possibility.For now I'll stick with my T637, and maybe I'll upgrade to a RAZR when they become cheaper or a new Sony Ericsson phone in the future when there is a compelling upgrade."
3,"Poor Graphics - but hey, it's winter!","Looking for an ultra-modern, fast paced, exciting racing game with end-over-end crashes? Well this ain't it!Looking to get over the winter blues because your hog is benched for the winter? This may help!Race Across America isn't the greatest looking game and it certainly doesn't have the greatest playability but it does offer a brief winter reprieve. The backgrounds in the game are nicely done and with a little imagination you can picture yourself out cruising America's highways - minus the smashed bugs in your teeth. Well worth 20 bucks."
2,Save your money.,The playability is lame. The graphics are below average. This game is not even close to being realistic. The sound f/x are not good. F.Y.I. I am running a 700 mhz pentium with a voodoo 3000 16mb 3dfx video card.
5,"Yeah, they're tops.","I saw the same router bit comparison article everyone else has and this is the nicest bit purchase I've made so far. Everything is perfect there's no gaps in the base behind the blades. The blades are thick and have a smooth edge on them. I cut through an inch of pine with it using a 3.25hp router at top speed and when I touched the bit shortly afterwards it wasn't even noticeably warm to the touch. The cut was clean and smooth. And yay, it's made in the US. Maybe the price is too much for a one-shot but if you plan on using it regularly I highly recommend it."
3,don't buy it for the integrated microphone,i bought this camera because my notebook computer didn't have an internal microphone. I was initially excited to see that the mike sound went thru the usb cable. I was quickly dissapointed though to hear the quality. A $5 (before $4.95 rebate - yes one nickel) no-name mike sounded infinitely superior. Video quality for webcam use exceeded my expectations. furnished software is so-so.
2,This webcam isn't very good,"This webcam isn't very good. The video is grainy, especially in low light. The drivers don't work very well in winXP either. Sometimes it won't let me save the settings for the camera. One good feature is the built-in microphone. I would reccomend a more expencive cam if you want better quality."
3,"3.5 star , not too bad at all","this thing is far SHARPER and colorsar e MORE saturated and contrastylike a semi decentdigital camera compared to junk by creativein same price class.GET ITits not too intuitive to install, you might helpeven on xp.but once you get it going..its SLOWER than creative.. probably abt 10 or less framesper second...butthe sharpness,colors and brightnessare much much betterin the price classif you can get it landed into your home forless than usd 44GET ITtksk"
1,BAD,"This webcamera is terrible. I didn't even get to use it because I couldn't get past setup. On the packaging it says it is made for windowsXP but can be compatible with three other systems including Microsoft Windows 98. I tried using it with 98 and it didn't work at all. I deffinately do not reccomend that you buy this camera. I've also heard that its performance with windows XP isn't that great either. If you want a webcamera that you can happily use, don't buy this camera."
5,Excellent Imagery,"I have owned and i have seen alot of PC Cams and they have been what i thought was excellent exposure, but i am here to tell you that the GE PC Camera is by for the best that i have ever seen. When i turn the cam on, the action and movement on screen is so real and the sharpness is also fantastic, i highly recommend that if your looking for a PC Cam, this is the one. It is great and i am happy that i bought it."
5,Monkey,This is a great cam i am 13 and i am good at complaining trust me so if i could i would complain but this is perfect i mean if your computer is slow all ready don't worry this cam has no efect. + this cam has great vedio my old cam was so slow that if u waved at it you looked like a robot but this cam shows every thing in real life speed and i really like its mic. it is clear and never skips what u are saying if u are looking for a web cam or just cam u MUST GET THIS ONE!!!
4,Easy Setup,"Found the setup on Win98SE, WinME, WIN2000Pro, and WIN XP, exceptionally easy. Works as advertised. Only complaint is that it is poor video in low light, but in a well-lit room, it works well."
4,Great feel-good book,"The authors of this book have put together a practically seemless yet intertwining collection of personal experiences with and lessons learned from their beloved dogs.If you're looking for profound philosophy, you'll want to go elsewhere. But if you simply want to take into consideration some stories and thoughts that might help you better enjoy your daily living, buy this book!An easy read that you can pick up any time you need a dose of emotion, this book is great for all people- not just dog lovers."
5,Beautiful!,This is the most beautiful CD I've ever heard. Putting Andrea Bocelli together with this music was pure genius.
3,Andrea Bocelli - Amore,"So, so....got this one because we learned of him during an Olympic preview on a morning news show. Also like the group Il Divo and thought this would be similar. As it turns out, no comparison. Il Divo definitely the best."
1,If a tone deaf person can sing....,"I don't think there is only 1 person out there knowing music and especially music education. Bocelli is always out of tone, and his voice can be heard just because somebody invented amplifiers some decades ago. Please, he has a nice voice, but that's it. The only merit he has is singing (or trying to sing) opera's arias; maybe young people will learn something about Melodramma. But please stop with these fakes like Bocelli or the actual Pavarotti, one of the greatest voices once, now good only to sing Funiculi' Funicula'. The Britney Spears of Operas."
4,Sweet,"Sometimes too sweet for a man. Sometimes cold and unnatural, as if he doesn't know what he is singing about. But mostly great."
5,Andrea Bocelli -Amore,Andrea Bocelli Beyond words.His voice is heavenly.I have at least a dozen of his C.D's.I have been an opera fan for years and he always delivers the best performance.I especially love the old Italian songs that he brings to his audience.
5,That's Amore,"This is my first Bocelli CD and I love it. His voice is amazing and so romantic. The live performance of ""Can't Help Falling in Love with You"" in English, just didn't seem to fit. Wish it would have been a studio cut in Italian. Over all a beautiful CD and a must have for any music lover."
4,I'm in love!,Andrea Bocelli is wonderful in this CD. He can make anyone fall in love with his voice and the song selection. A great gift for a loved one...
5,ms GG,wounderful!! at his best !! I listened to it for hours and have never tied of it. would happily buy it again
5,Smooth,I sure to love his work--anything he does.This album only has one english song-but sometimes it is better not to be concentrating on words and just let it all flow through you...........
1,Big disapointment,"I like Bocelli in classics and when I bought Il Divo this was reccomended to me. What a waste. Bocelli should stick with what he is good with. His Spanish sucks, it seems all songs lack sentiment. Maybe because I compare with original renderings of those songs they all suck. I could not finish Amapola, hated Somos Novios, played the CD once and retired it. What a waste!"
1,A Real Loser - Two Thumbs DOWN,"One of the earlier reviewers got it exactly right "" Bocelli at his worst., June 12, 2006"". This album of songs sung either off key or with their melodies reinterpreted is not listenable. The acompanament is thin to sparse. All but one song is sung in Italian or Spanish versions instead of English; e.g. ""Autumn Leaves"" and ""It's Impossible"", othewrise beautiful songs which are disasters in the treatment given them. Track 9 is REALLY awful ... actually discordant as Bocelli attempts to render it in ajzzy style. The entire album is awful.The morons who designed the paper insert will no doubt receive awards for this unreadable pice of work ... tiny red printing on a black background ... lyrics printed in Italian or Spanish so no English speaker can even see a translation."
1,Embarassing,"Liberace, Glenn Gould, Britney Spears... sometimes immense popular success is inexplicable. I just went to a cocktail party given by an American in Rome, at which the American played this album to ""make his guests confortable."" Fortunately his Italian was minimal, or he'd have heard the mockery. Bocelli has very little vocal technique, so you might think this performance would be more plausible than his opera CDs. Well, you'd be wrong. These songs derive from a tradition of very virtuosic singing in Italy, a tradition which is fading today but still well remembered. Just listen to the early recordings of Claudio Villa if you want to hear how these songs should be sung. If you've seen the movie The Big Night, you've heard Claudio Villa singing the beautifully decorated theme-song. Get the soundtrack to that movie and I promise you'll hear the difference!"
2,Simply amazing...,"It's simply amazing that people with such little talent become famous, bravo to Bocelli for hustling people to believe he can sing. I agree with the previous reviewer, how on earth could you ever compare Bocelli to the great tenors of the past? According to most of the reviewers on this site so long as I develop a life long nasal infection and am permanently forced to sing in a clogged and obnoxiously nasal fashion I too will become one of the worlds great tenors. If you can even call him that (I prefer the term piece of trash). Kudos to you Mr. Bocelli, you've become almost as talented as 50 cent..."
2,Opera For Dummies,"While I am no classical aficionado, I'm not so nave to impudently compare this universal mega-star lite-weight to that of Pavarotti or Lanza. This man is opera for the VH1 generation who couldn't tell a sonata from an opus. He overreaches each dirge after another, racing for the crescendo with the orchestra, signifying the big finish/happy ending with not so much a modicum of passion or emotion. Industry fiend David Foster pontificates the production until it sounds like Bocelli is about to spontaneously combust, melodramatically exaggerating in a multi-lingual smorgasbord of cheese. Downgraded because I blame him for Josh Groban and Il Divo. My grade: C-"
2,Not the usual quality,"I have every cd of Andrea Bocelli. All are beauitful, save for this one. I was disappointed at the mediocracy"
1,Andrea Bocelli has disappointed me greatly,This is not the Andrea Bocelli that we have all come to love. The music and background is very disappointing. His voice is not used to potential.
3,Mediocre - Andrea can do better,"I bought this CD a while ago, I tried to make myself like the songs, but really I regret buying it. I loved 'Cieli di Toscana' and compared to that this hardly makes the cut. For me there was not enough Italian (if I wanted Spanish or English I would have bought another artist but then again I should have checked the track titles) and it seemed rather cookie cutter. I bought the CD based on my previous good experiences with Bocelli, but this did not live up to my expectations. If you are a first timer go with 'Cieli'."
2,Still do not understand?,"Why people like his voice so much? I listened to this whole album (ok I tried!) and was turned off by the 3rd song. I don't know whether this is due to his voice or the lack of good producing...either way the album wasn't bearable. I've also listened to his ""opera"" albums and I must say it was even more disappointing than this! Still, like I said above..I do not understand why people find his voice great, when there are way better singers out there who can do it better. Sorry, but Andrea Bocelli just doesn't cut it for me."
3,Not quite a dolphin-like as someone said but still doubtful,"Is he really a great singer? or does he gets a benefit from the selection of the songs put together for him - i.e. other artists's hit songs or the familiar tunes.And, I am always nervous watching him sing on TV as he often goes off the keys and cannot hide the inconsistent vibrations. I hope he puts more heart in the songs he sings to make me believe it, not just a sweet melody. For the sweet ballad sounds, we have too many artists who have done it better than he did and many of them at least creatively re-arranged the original songs and get their credit for singing in their unique ways. But, Bocelli sings songs that Sarah Brightman or Julio Iglesias interpreted, but not as close to perfection of Brightman's or heart-felt sounds like Iglesias. I just can't believe he has great talent as many would think he has or unique. I have heard many songs of that style from Europe, USA, and Asia, and I can pick out better singers' names of his kind."
2,"I just can't get into it, maby if it was in english","I heard andrea bocelli on a sarah brightman CD and it was amazing, but some of it was in english and the song was a great one, I just can't get into this CD maby if it were in english I'd enjoy it. It could be the songs but since it's not in english I can't say for sure."
1,Bocelli at his worst.,"To say this was a wrong turn for Bocelli is an understatement. This record is a wreck from beginning to end. The music arrangements are sappy; Andrea's vocals are lifeless, especially when he sings in Spanish.Bocelli does not compare to Pavarotti or Domingo but he does have a nice voice. I hope he has the opportunity of using it in the future instead of falling for these empty commercial releases that no doubt will bring him a lot of money.Sad."
2,very middle of the road,"when Andrea Bocelli first emerged into the Mainstream I really dug His Vocal tone&the way he would phrase.but over the course of years he has been stuck in a middle of the road slick format way of Making records which is cool for the audeince it caters to,but the Man has more range than what He puts out.I don't really like these standard type of Projects because it seems so middle of the road&a last ditch effort in some ways.I hope Bocelli challenges himself more in the future because He has the range."
3,disappointing,"While Andrea's voice is ALWAYS dreamy, this collection was not as great as I had anticipated. There was nothing that was totally moving and uplifting, nothing that drew me in or made my heart swell, which is the gold standard for me, for opera. Such a talented artist, such a mediocre cd. I will still buy his cd's, but, if given the chance, I would pass this one by. I gave it 3 stars, simply because he is the great Andrea!!!!"
3,Great artist.,"Good cd but have enjoyed some of his others better. Would still highly recommend it .Service was great and on time ,Thanks."
3,This is not the same songs as my 1st Amore CD.,"I purchased ""Amore"" for myself over a year ago and decided to purchase it for my Boss for Christmas. Some of the songs on this ""Amore"" CD are a little different from my CD. Why have some changed?Sincerely,Barbara"
4,Bravo Amore,"Once again, Bocelli has presented us with an endearing recording, Amore. I especially love the Elvis Presley tune, ""Can't Help Falling in Love"". There are several easy listening serenedes on this disc."
4,Andrea Bocelli - Amore,"An excellent compilation which suits the master Opera/Classical singer's first venture into more traditional music. Partnered by some great artists it is a very good CD.Prevented from a 5 star rating for me because despite being stunning musically the recording (quality of the CD)is very slightly flat, lacking punch.Very enjoyable though."
5,happy for Bocelli's successes.,"It's apparent there are a couple 'opera/tenor snobs' in previous reviews. if someone likes and enjoys an artist's talent, then success. your voice and music is pleasing to listeners - great for you Bocelli! all you snobs out there, go spout your little intellectualized diatribes in your bathroom mirrors to 'impress' yourselves. no one else cares!"
2,Beware: Product has changed,"I have been using the excellent Lynco sports orthotics for more than a decade (the L420 Men's 10 to be precise), buying half a dozen pairs per year. But the most recent set is different: With the new orthotic inserted, my feet no longer fit in my shoes. Not off by much, but enough to make an uncomfortable difference - the foot now rides higher in the shoe. The only outward sign of change is that the new ones have an 'Aetrex"" logo imprinted on them - not previously seen. Does this mean Aetrex acquired the Lynco line and changed it? I don't know. I do know I just spent $240 for a product that no longer works for me. Bummer."
1,I'm steamin mad!,"I purchased my DW359 about four years ago. I am a home hobiest, and the saw gets very little use. I would guess the saw has less than one hour of run time total. Last weekend while cutting a couple of 2X4's I noticed the saw emiting lots of sparks from the brushes, way more than usual. I cleaned the commutator and brushes, the saw still sparked. I took the saw to the repair shop and was told the armature was burned out. What? The saw has hardly been used. Dewalt customer service blew me off and would not offer any compensation. I purchased a professional grade saw so I would not have to deal with broken, cheap junk and possibly someday I could pass it along to my grandchildren. I guess Dewalts idea of professional grade is one hour of run time with no customer support. Spend your money somewhere else, This could just as easily be you writing this!"
1,Another fried armature,"I got mine as a Christmas present a few years ago. It has only a few hours of use. I still have the original blade on it! My armature blew while cutting a pine 2X6.I was considering getting it fixed, but I think I will go buy a new one. I'll probably just buy a cheap, disposable one since the high end saws appear to be crap too."
1,Fried armature here too!!!,"Very light use, still on the stock blade, armature fried while cutting mdf. Just like someone else the saw stopped dead in it's tracks. Shame on you dewalt!!"
1,Another one bites the (saw)dust...,"Same story: Low mileage (less than 10 hours over 3-4 years), armature burned out. Repair too expensive. Also lost a Dewalt hammerdrill this year drilling through brick to hang hose reel. Looking for good saw for shed I'm building to replace this piece of junk but I'm done with DeWalt."
2,Good but got disappopinted..,"First of all, the product pic needs to be changed. The pic looks like Wireless and the real one is wired. though the headset is compact and works fine, i am still terribly disappointed with the feeling of being betrayed by the Picture. Strongly felt there are much cheaper and equally good headsets for lesser price..."
1,bad design,"Purchased this as a Christmes present. The design was bad, joints were loose, bit were cheep. not a good purchase. I returned this and am still looking for a better one."
4,22 piece Ratchet Screwdrover Set,"This is not top-quality stuff, and having no place to store the bits in the tool itself can be inconvenient. But I wanted one of these to keep in my office drawer so I don't have to run to my regular, better-quality ratchet set every time I need to use a screwdriver. Cheap enough, and for that purpose it is perfectly adequate."
1,Very Poor Excuse for Cheap Tool,This product was delivered on time as always with Amazon. The product quality is very poor. No rigidity in the flex-handle making almost unsafe to use as a regular straight screwdriver. I bought this to come up with the difference to get the free shipping. I tossed into a box and will never use it again. I didn't even get to use it the first time. Don't waste your money.
1,"Horrible, Horrible Transfer To Blu","I have both of these films on Miramax DVD and they look SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better than this horrible, horrible blu-ray transfer. I was hoping to get rid of my older DVDs and replace with blu-ray, but with this crappy release, I will hold onto my DVDs for now. Echo Bridge churns out NOTHING BUT CRAP!!! Don't waste your money like I did!!"
3,minus special features,"both of the films are great ... because i am a number one fan of jackie chan ... unfortunately, those blueray disc doesn't include any special features. The worse part is , there is no original language of the movies"
4,Haunting Prose,"This collection of letters serves as a wonderful primary source of information about the Germans' perspective of the war. Sometimes heartbreaking and sometimes overly prideful, these show how soldiers felt on the frontlines. Also, these letters show how sentiments changed over time -- in both good times and bad."
1,Whatta shame!,"The audio quality on a lot of these songs sounds like what you'd get if you recorded your favorite Doris Day records by playing them on your stereo and then put a mike in the middle of the living room to pick up the sound. Murky and echoy. This CD also contains the strangest song for duet I've ever heard, ""How Lovely Cooks the Meat!?!?!?!,"" since Sinatra sang ""Mama Will Bark"" with Dagmar for Columbia. While I'm mentioning Sinatra, there's a similar collection ""Duets with the Dames"" by this same outfit that I was going to pick up, but after suffering through the poor production values of this CD; I'm giving it a wide pass. What could have been two finds for both artist's fans instead just turns out to be a crying shame."
1,save your money,this one is not that great. There are better DD restrosepctives out there. The one with all the sitcom movie themes is much better.
3,50 Years of Formula One,Was expecting more on the racing aspect. This was more on the race tracks and the views of them. Not enough on any drivers just a flash here and there. Was a little disappointing.
5,A Great Book - One of a Kind,"In the work place, we all know that we are good and believe that is all that it takes to get ourselves promoted, automatically. Mr. Rye does an excellent job of pointing out that this may not happen unless you take action to promote yourself every day. He gives you well over 1,001 ways to do that. I use it as a daily reference book and it has already helped me get the promotion that I have always wanted. I'm already working on my next promotion, thanks to Mr. Rye's advice."
2,Underwhelmed.,"The author may have been an innovator in her time, but the book does not hold a candle to the beaded-flower books of today. Large step-by-step color photos are almost a requirement for clear understanding of techniques. This book doesn't provide them."
2,Not for weak stomachs,"I have used several types of this genre of product. To be honest, I can not rate it based on effectiveness, because I get severe stomach pain after taking one capsule. I'm not sure if it is the cayenne pepper or the horse chestnut (or another ingredient) that causes the discomfort. I took the product over about two weeks, intermittently, to be sure that this was what caused my stomach issues. After testing, I was left with no doubt. I am not saying it isn't an effective product, but I can say that it is hard on the stomach .. mine at least, and I've never really had stomach issues (I can eat habanero sauce with most)."
1,Makes me nauseous,"I have a very strong stomach. Hardly ever I get stomach sick, but this suppliment just did it every time. A snack is not enough, you need a mighty big meal and you still feel nauseous. Could be just me, but as I said I could eat anything and feel fine. I used Life Extension, that sits just fine with me."
4,Candy,"Great combo for vein support. All vein support, not just legs. I assume the word is out. I really had trouble finding this stuff."
5,Honest Music,"I was so moved by my first listening of this amazing album. The entire album is a careful, simple, lovely piece of artwork. From the personal stories told through her thoughtful lyrics to the amazing artwork on the album, this is a singer songwriter that you should not miss. This brave, stripped down recording is a rare find these days. (...)"
1,Get a different textbook!,"Poor organization and focus. Repetitive material sometimes conflicting. Inadequate information in some areas, too much in others. Abandoned this text for another to prepare for national registry."
4,A worthwhile text and great reference,"While the information can, at times, be repetitive or confusing, overall the book stresses those skills and topics which are important for prehospital emergency providers. The book is easy to use as a reference, reads at a slightly higher level than many introductory texts, and can be a valuable resource even for an EMT-P. This book does require, however, some direction and sometimes elaboration from from a knowledgeable and organized ""Basic"" instructor.Worth owning and using."
1,Our entire EMT class hates this book.,"Contains conflicting information. Is written more for memorization as opposed to garnering a true understanding of how and why things work. The workbook provides answers to the questions, some of which are incorrect. A poor learning tool."
2,This is an old version of the book,"This book has the majority of the same info as the new book, but be advised, it is an older version."
3,Good Huxley Footage,"This film is unique in the fact that it contains a good deal of original interview footage (15-20 minutes) of Aldous covering many topics from social reform to hallucinogenics, however, I found the parts in which the director Oliver Hockenhull applies Huxley to his own life rather odd, and slightly demented. However, to own this video, is also to own very rare footage of Huxley. Well worth it."
4,It's In The Praise,"That is one of the praise and worship CD's I've heard in quite sometime. If you like praise and worship, I would get this project."
4,chefs fun shack,"now i want to get this straight, yes this game is repitive andit is ... but its fun. i bought this game after hearing dire reviews and i think its had too many bad reviews.the game is funny and i have had it for a month and only had 1 question repeated, and why are people bothered about the begining bit cause i always skip it. this is a really fun game to play with mates and on your own so dont listen to everyone who thinks every game should be as good as shenmue or tomb raider. its a fun game which grows on you so rent it then buy it."
2,"Fun at first, boring and repetitive later!","This game is ufnny yes, and it is fun but when this is all you play, and when you play it alot it gets very boring. So many of the same questions over and over, and you can't choose the mini games if you want to play them, they are selected randomly after every round. Sometimes there are games you want to play and you can't because the comp never chooses them. The game gets very very boring when you've played it alot, take my word for it, if you can stand playing this game regularly for more than 3 months, go back to pre-school because thats where you belong."
1,Do Not Buy This Game,The Mini games in this are so simplistic and lame that I thought maybe the game was made for preschoolers even the biggest south park fan will be very disappointed with this game.
1,Dumbest Game Ever,"Dont get me wrong I'm a Huge SP fan, but this has to be one of the most dissapointing games in my gaming experience...it would probably play on my Atari if I could hook up a CD-rom to it! Back to the drawing board for these guys and here's a Hint: The new Dreamcast system has 128-bit graphics and 3-D capability, why dont you use that to your advantage! I hate to give this game even one star."
2,South Park: Chef's Luv Shack,When I rented this game I was hopeing for a fun and hillariousgame. As I started to play I thought boy this is awesome. But thenthey started asking the same questions and it got old. This might be a game that is worth a rental but I would never buy it. I wish this game was more like the N64 South Park game that they have. Here are 4 good reason why I think this game doesn't deserve to be bought.1.)The only real fun thing about this game is the mini games.2.)They ask the same questions over and over again.3.)It isn't as funny as I thought it would be.4.)This is a major upset compared to the game on N64 of South Park when you make yellow snowballs and shoot cows.END
3,Fun but repetitive,The game is a lot of fun but with just two people playing for less than a day we have already seen repeated questions in the trivia sections.The old style arcade games (with a South Park spin) takes us back to the days of plunking quarters in the machines in the 7-11's.
2,not what i expected,"i thought this game would have more game interactivity. This game has too much CD processing; and not enough game time, game scence taht are on it, are funny and cute , but VERY short."
2,Didn't work well on two systems,"I first installed this game on a Pentium Pro 180 with Win98 about a year ago when I received it as a christmas present, and it simply didn't run. I don't remember whether or not it hung my computer, but needless to say it didn't work. A few months ago I built a newer computer (Athlon 800/384MB/Win2k) and tried installing it on that machine. It installed and worked.... sort of. There's lots of CD access and some annoying quirks with my otherwise flawlessly working video card. I was able to play it however, and it wasn't all that fun. Rent it if you're really curious, but otherwise I'd say stay away."
3,"OK for the Office, but No good for Gaming","I have to admit, the main reason for buying this was, 1. the reviews, 2. the price. This is a very cheap set for a wireless mouse and keyboard. And althought the mouse is NOT optical, they both work very well seperately. This is a perfect set if you DO NOT play modern PC/online games. However, the systems cannot handle simultaneous mouse and keyboard actions. Holding a key down and moving the mouse will not work. All in all, it's a good set for the standard user who wants the freedom of wireless."
2,Insufficient Range for Conference Room Application,"We purchased this product for a conference room computer which we use for presentations. The distance from the head of our conference table to the A/V cabinet where the computer is housed is 20 feet. Based on our testing, the RF range of the Michael Graves Wireless Keyboard and Mouse combo is only about 12 feet.We ended up replacing this product with the Microsoft Wireless Desktop for Bluetooth, which has a 30 foot range. Another excellent choice for conference room applications is the Gyration Keyboard and Mouse Suite."
2,Not Spill Resistant,"I can't believe it, I used the keybored and mouse for 2 months then I spilled a few drops of coke on it , most keyboreds will take that but not on this one. Now I have to use a wired keybored and a mouse that constntly runs low on battery! I would NOT recomend this product."
3,MICHAEL GRAVES VS GE,"I just wanted to say that by reading the reviews for the Michael Graves Wireless Keyboards. . . has 110% more positive feedback on it. (Which I am in the process of ordering right now.) As oppose to GE. All reviews on Michael Graves are positive and would recommend to others and GE's reviews are pretty much negative and makes you not want to buy any sort of wireless keyboard or mouse no matter what brand it may be. So I hope they read the Michael Graves reviews and return their GE items in exchange for Michael Graves and not just stick to the wired keyboards and mice thinking that they will all be the same. I am giving 3 starts because I have not yet used the product, but am confident that it will be a 5 star after I do."
3,"It's good, but it's bad...","In my ""it can't be over"" quest for Queer As Folk, I found out there are books written about them, so of course, I go off and read them, but not in order. *laugh* Anyway, this one is right after college - kind of the ""back story"" to the series, I suppose. It was just ""okay"". The writing was mediocre, but it was nice to visit with the QAF crew again - if only through a book.Hmmm... maybe they will write a book for the ""after"" the show type of thing. The end of the show sucked so bad, surely they want to redeem themselves *laugh*Okay, back to the book... the oddest part for me was the little run in with Justin and Daphne as 5th graders - just kind of an oddball thing to throw in there.I dunno... it was good, not great, but nice. Yeah, I know... indecisive much?"
3,Trash or Treasure Guide of Buyers by Tony Hyman,All in all it is a good book and covers a good variety of things that you might normally not think to keep. Know it's hard to cover everything in just one book but I was disappointed that several of the current collectibles weren't covered (or I couldn't locate them) in this book. You almost have to read or scan through the whole book because some items that weren't listed in the index are referred to under other parts of the book. Takes a bit of time to read through but very informative.
2,"Got Stuff Made Before 1970? Buy The Book. Otherwise, Forget It","This is a review of this product:""Trash or Treasure - Guide To Buyers"" by Tony Hyman. Amazon may display this review on the page of another version of this product, for which this review may not apply. After reading this review, please click on the link so that you can be assurred that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for.--------------------------------------------------I bought this book because I have a lot of 1980s and 1990s action figures, comic books, magazines, trading cards, and the such. I was hoping to finally find someone to sell them to. Well, I contacted some people listed in the book, and ... I've still got the stuff. If you have something made before 1970, this book may be of use to you. But if your stuff was made after 1970, don't waste your money on this UNCOMPREHENSIVE book. Hey, Tony Hyman, how about writing/compiling a separate volume covering items made after 1970?"
1,I believe I was ripped off by a dealer listed in this book.,"This book promotes itself as a source for ""honest"" dealers and buyers for your antiques and collectibles.I sent 2 pieces of glass to one of their ""honest"" dealers, who had me send them insured for $800 and $500 respectively.Since then that ""honest"" dealer has disappeared along with my glass. Disconnected phones and so on.In a call to the author in California, to see if he knew where the dealer had gone, since he had recommended the dealer in his book, I was welcomed with an attitude of no desire to even talk to me, let alone to be of any assistance.I wish I had never seen this book."
5,Very helpful,I found this book valuable in saparating my hoarder brother's junk from valuables. I found it interesting even in parts that weren't relevanty to my taask
1,Not very useful.,It's very difficult to have an up-to-date price guide. Just do current web research and you will have better results. I haven't seen the buyer's guide companion to this book but it is probably more useful.
4,Tan's illustrations carry it.,"Gary Crew, The Viewer (Simply Read Books, 2003)Any book illustrated by Shaun Tan is probably going to be a winner, and Gary Crew's The Viewer is no exception. A boy finds a box, takes it home, and finds a Viewmaster inside with a set of discs that are unlike anything he's ever seen before. Very short, and Tan's illustrations are the star attraction here, but still well worth your time, no matter your age. ****"
1,Horribly dark,This is the worst childrens book I have ever read. There should be a warning label on this book. My daughter is in first grade and brought this book home and I was amazed at how graphic it is. This is not a children's book and should be relabeled to something else instead.
1,what an ass... part two,"I couldn't help noticing that the author raises the book rate everytime he decides to respond to a review. C'mon, man, you must be old enough to accept criticism. You have more entries than all your critics together. How about some reality check?"
1,What an idiot.......,"""Dude"", you sound like a real idiot. Not everyone is going to like your work so just chill. Although, that review by your ""editor"" was a nice touch."
5,Recommended for students of Yoga and Buddhism.,"Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche's Guru Yoga examines the beliefs of Vajrayana Buddhist traditions of Tibet, focussing on the practice of 'guru yoga', merging with the mind of the master, and considering its practice and benefits. Chapters provide important links between devotion and the power of the master to provide ultimate realization."
1,Not Impressed,I was disappointed in this product and felt that it didn't do what it should have. I would not buy it again.
5,Great for a trip to the dentist!,"I've used Rescue Remedy with cats but never tried it myself. Then my periodontist (a scientist!) recommended that I use it pre-surgury to calm my nerves, and use a few drops more during the surgury any time that I started to feel anxious. It really did take the edge off without making me feel drowsy. Now I use it whenever I go to the dentist for any reason or any other stressful situation, even at work. It's worth a try."
4,Great Product that has helped many!!!,"I was first introduced to Rescue Remedy through a holistic bodyworker who used it on specific clients and it worked like a charm. According to the bodyworker and my doula, it is not as effective as the original remedy called 5 Flowers but I would say definitely better than nothing! It's more difficult to find 5 Flowers....I'd say try that first if you can locate it, otherwise Rescue Remedy is the next best option!!!"
5,Calms my kitty,"This is a great product. We have traveled all over the world with our cat and we give this to him about an hour before we leave for the airport. He does really well but it helps that we were blessed with a cat with a great personality and temperment. We do notice a difference though if we give this to him or not. When we dont hes more grumpy and tends to whine more and breathe heavy with panting, but when we give him this as soon as it kicks in he sits quietly and usualy falls asleep after a while but not drug enduced sleep more like becasue hes bored. Im 100% against drugging your animal for travel it tends to make things worse for them but this stuff dosnt make them drowsy or lethargic in any way. Just calm. I also give it to him before he goes to the vet or groomers and he does so good with them. I recommend this product to any one who is planning on traveling with a pet."
2,Didn't work for our dog,"We have a rescued dog who has turned out to have severe separation anxiety, and we've been trying many different things that might help him. We bought the pet version of Rescue Remedy hoping it would help -- but at least for our dog, it seemed to have no effect. It may be that his anxiety is too strong for this product to help it -- we're trying prescription medicine from our vet next."
3,stress relief?,"not sure if I like or would recommend this product. It tastes awful and I really honestly do not seem to get any relief from taking it. I will keep trying it because I spent my money on it, but I don't think I will be ordering anymore of it. I would not recommend buying this product if you are looking for stress relief in a bottle!"
1,BikeSomeWhere Sux,"These guys are not honest. Ordered this item. Did not arrive. (For over a MONTH!) Several phone calls to full VM box. Did not reply to emails. Submitted claim to Amazon then, BikeSomeShere canceled my order so that I could not leave well deserved negative feedback. These guys cannot be trusted. Go to their storefront and see how many similar complaints. Buy this from someone else."
4,Annually Outstanding,"If you have used the maps in the past you won't be disappointed.The most visible new feature is the flexible plastic cover.Almost every new street in Riverside County is there, and the constant city boundry shifts are there, the newest schools aren't there though, at least in the Alvord and Riverside Districts.I would have given the map Five stars, but they have yet to update the footprints of Downtown Riverside's main buildings such as all the new court buildings, in which some are almost ten years old. And how hard is it to put a red dot at the corner of Harrison and Garfield to denote Juvenile hall.I sometimes get the feeling that Thomas Bros. doesn't spend quite as much time working on the Riverside County maps as they do for other counties.Still, 4 stars out of 5."
4,Missigng Episodes,If you like LONG dramas I recommend this one.I downloaded most of it but its a pity that episodes 45&46 are missing.I hope that amazon would put it for download.
4,matchbox 20 live,"If you're a matchbox 20 fan, you might like this DVD. Great live performance.Don't like the LIVE version of the song ""If you're gone"" and ""Disease"". all the rest are nice."
1,SHOW-A NIGHT IN THE LIFE OF MATCHBOX 20,"Very, very disappointed! I read the reviews but I didn't believethe vocals would be so low that I coudn't hear the lyrics. This DVD is going to the garbish. I don't think Matchbox 20 could take it back nor the producers, otherwise this DVD will be out of the shelves.Amazon.com, will you stop selling this DVD so no more customers get mad and disappointed like me?I lost money so they lost a fan too. Never again I'll buy another CD/DVD from them, and no more tickets to their concerts unless I get my money back... Yeah right!!!DO NOT BUY THIS DVD, DON'T BE A FOOL."
2,Poor Sounds Destroys Great Concert DVD,"I have to concur with the several other people regarding the putrid sound quality on this DVD. The band is great, the songs are wonderful, the shots are good - the sound is shocking (I have a reasonable 5.1 sound system and over 100 music DVDs to compare against).I would strongly recommend (insist actually) that the producers of this DVD a) retract the product until another - qualified - sound company can fix it, and b) ensure that the sound people who did this DVD never work in the industry again.Matchbox 20 should take this up with the produces as well, as it hinders their brand and the beauty of their music. I doubt they want their fans to be so disappointed."
5,GREAT DVD!,"I was at the DVD release party premier at the Avalon Hollywood and to put it simply ""THIS DVD ROCKS""!!! The sound and image is excellently implemented - its as if I was at the concert!"
5,Amazing,"I just received this dvd, and I must say it is the best concert dvd I have seen!! Even if your not a huge Matchbox Twenty fan, you'll appreciate this. Rob Thomas at his best!!! A must have for all Matchbox fans."
4,"A good concert, an ok documentary","This is an entire concert from one the tour to support the bands 3rd album. It has a good mix of songs, a few surprises. High quality video (shot in digitally with HD cameras), the sound is about average for a 5.1 mix of live concert. SRS adds a bit of depth (if your equipment support sit).The concert is 16:9 (anamorphic widescreen) so if you have a widescreen TV it looks really good. The documentary is not widescreen and mildy interesting. I was bit disapointed in the documentary part because I was envisioning something more along the lines of U2's Rattle & Humm, but instead got something suited for a VH1 special. Those were my expectations, not something the band promised."
2,Yes... the sound is REALLY bad!,"I am a HUGE Matchbox Twenty fan and went to three shows on this tour. I was chomping at the bit waiting for this disc to be released only to be extremely disappointed.Yes the audio quality is as bad as others have said... but the thing I find the most distracting is the artifical crowd noise inserted throughout. They make it seem as if every audience member is screaming their head off from the moment the concert starts until the band walks off stage. It's really annyoing.Visually, the concert is quite stunning. Great to see.I would re-buy this disc if they re-released it with the audio corrected. How about it MB20... how about fixing the sound?P.S. And please don't tell me I don't know how to set up my surround sound."
1,Bad sound makes this UNWATCHABLE,"I love Matchbox Twenty and love to see and hear them play, but the sound on this is AWFULL! I would like to listen to the band, not the crowd. What was the production team doing??? I can't stand to plug this DVD in, what a shame and a waste of money!"
3,Crap - bad sound ruins it,"I have a pretty good surround sound system (Pioneer 1014, JBL Northridge all around) and when I played this DVD I seriously thought something was wrong with my system. The audio sounds very bright and harsh. The crowd noise is way too loud. Rob's voice echos too much.I'm an MB20 fan and I've been excited about this DVD for a while. I'm so surprised to find out that for such a great set list the editors didn't take care of the audio. Major disappointment. I really wish I could get my money back."
4,"Great disc, but not DTS sound","This disc is packaged nicely and beautifully shot, but it DOES NOT have DTS sound. The DTS logo does not appear anywhere on the disc or packaging. The only options for playback are stereo and 5.1 surround. The 5.1 mix is pretty heavy in the rears with crowd noise to give the feel of being at the show. Otherwise this disc is very professionally filmed, edited well and all in all, it's well worth the money."
5,Only Great,"Great Performances, Great Pictures, Great Sound =Great DVD.This DVD's only rival is Dave Mathews DVD, except Matchbox 20 sounds a bit more like your'e at the concert.Awesome."
3,GREAT VIDEO...POOR AUDIO!!!,"WARNING!!!! Believe others that have rated the poor audio on this DVD. I have a big dollar system, so don't say it's the surround system or not knowing how to set it up because it's all crap!The annoying crowd noise and Rob Thomas's voice not carrying though on the audio are true. Those that have rated this dvd high have probably not seen many live concert dvds to rate this against. I have a large collection and I would rate the video on this dvd as the best because it is filmed in high definition! If the audio was as good as the video it truly would be the best concert dvd so far...a true shame because the set and the song collection are great...a true waste!I would recommend; Eric Clapton, One more Car One more Rider for true sound and video.... and if you truly want to feel the BIG LIVE EXPERIENCE then try.... INXS Live Baby Live or Tina Turner One Last Time both at Wembley Stadium with crowds that will give you the true feeling of being there!"
1,Sound Quality is AWFUL!,"I was so disappointed when I watched this DVD! I wasn't even able to watch more than 4 songs because the audio was so irritating. First off, you can barely hear Rob Thomas' vocals over the band and second, you can barely hear the band over the crowd. It was very muffled sounding and impossible to make out any of the lyrics. My husband said it was just like listening from the bathroom where the concert was being held. Since this DVD was assembled from many different concerts, I am shocked that the filmmakers did not correct the audio after reviewing some of the footage. I really like this band and was looking forward enjoying this DVD for a long time. I feel like it was a waste of money."
3,Surprise,"One thousand years in the future following a great war, the people of earth have been moved around, ""shuffled"". This story follows a group of fighter-priests-samurai in a walking tour of the old northeastern US. Plenty of action and new people move this story along. The end surprises due to a twist worthy of entry into the old ""Dangerous Visions"" anthology. Alien reptiles have made a play to take over and the heroes infiltration of the alien ship will take you unprepared."
1,Don't buy this video,"This video was extremely boring to me, my husband, and our young son. He has another farm video that showed a lot more detail about farming and tractors. This didn't really show anything about tractors other than the inside controls. It showed a tractor pull that was also boring. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone of any age."
4,Surprisingly great indie rock in the veign of Death Cab For Cutie - chances are you'll love it! - 4.5 stars,"It was only upon the recommendation of a friend that I even found out about this band, but I'm glad I did! It's not entirely original, but chances are you won't really care. It's basically straight-up indie rock which somehow manages to sound different and unique yet familiar at the same time. The singer does a pretty good job - he doesn't fit the music perfectly, but I think most people will like him. What's great is that the lyrics are interesting (though hard to make out), and that the musicianship is fantastic. Every song here is good, too, as they definitely can make a good hook. I wouldn't call it a classic, but it comes close. Indie and pop rock fans will most likely really enjoy this album. Highly recommended!Highlights include:the entire album!"
5,you'll heal the world in spite of itself,"Indyrock with super melodies. And a songbird voice at the helm. Think Jeff Buckley. Not like Jeff Buckley, but songbirdish in that way, perhaps. And these songs are all phenomenal, every one. I saw them live at the 929 in richmond. That's how I discovered them, and they struck me. The bass player is Chris Squire esque, because the bass guitar is sharp and driving and dynamic in a lot of the songs. The harmonizing between the three members is also divine. Nobody really harmonizes like that much, anymore. It's a sixties thing. And it works great, here. Maybe you should think of Death Cab for Cutie except take Gibbard out of the equation and put in early-Yes vocalization capabilities, full with the harmonies and everything. Yes! Or no. Anyway, if you love your tender sweet and edgy melodic lo-fi rock, you'll have to get this, fersure."
5,Just get this!,"Without going too deep into this, I just have to say this is the best unheard album of 2002. This band has it all. They go hard, they go soft, and they have a great singer. The attention to mood and detail is succinct. We could trot out some namechecking but this is beyond simple spot the influence. They just want to make music that endures. And their skills show that they can do so. This is not some sort of emo-thing, this is about sincerity and insight. So if you aren't afraid of music that reaches for emotional connection over simple minded booty shaking, this is for you. I can't wait to see what comes next!"
1,Baby Newton minus the clown!,"This was Baby Newton minus the clown. I felt cheated, the format was so similar even my son picked up on it. No new material. He got bored after just a few minutes. I love the movies, my cildren learn a lot from them, but I think the producers got lazy on this one. (I have a two year old and six month old) We love doing the discovery cards together and learning new words, as well as watching the extra puppet shows- again nothing new for him to learn- and there were only three extra puppet shows...I haven't been inpressed with the comapny since Baby on the Go, and for the record- I have seen, and own EVERY einstein dvd!"
5,Great BE video!,We love this one-I really feel that it has helped my son with learning some of his shapes-have watched it over and over (and over)
2,baby einstein discovering shapes,"the video is hit or miss as to whether it will play. Sometimes it will, and often times it won't. It will more likely play on our computer, but that is not convenient for our children to sit around and watch. Otherwise it's a great educational tool I wish we could view more often. We love Baby Einstein."
3,Another good video by Baby Einstein,"We like this video as with most Baby Einsteins, however, have a problem with the sound on our home stereo system. The sound for music comes out load and clear but the speech for the shapes is very, very quiet. When you want to learn the names, it creates a problem."
3,TOO QUIET,"I know everyone raves about Baby Einstein, but I found it irritatingly quite. The speak practically whispers when she says the colors or shapes. I think it's more for parents then kids. If you kids is like mine and they have alot of energy They will be too board to learn anything. Which would be pointless?"
3,Didn't they already do shapes?,"I have Baby Newton, which was the first Baby Einstein released after Disney bought out Julie Aigner-Clark. It is all about shapes. Isn't this redundant? I'd hope to see more original ideas for dvds, as we love Baby Einstein."
5,entertaining,"my grandson loves it and that is all that matters to me and his Mom. Of course the teenage children are like ""not again"""
5,Great Service - Great Product,"I buy these DVD's for my grandson and me. He's 20mths and he loves them. He gets so excited, he actually screams with glee when they start playing. That's the part I love. He always learns something new each time he watches them."
4,Baby Einstein Does It Again,"My son loves the Baby Einstein videos. His Great Grandma got him this DVD. I honestly wasn't sure if he would be into it. To me it seemed a little boring. He loves it though! It's not his absolute favorite, but it is up there - and does a great job at holding his attention. He has also become interested in shapes since watching this, and is now very into his shape sorter. Like all the Baby Einstein videos, I wouldn't say it makes your baby smarter, but it definitely sparks their interest in learning. It also helps if you watch the video with them to reinforce what they are watching :)"
3,Didn't work for my daughter,"My daughter was not very interested after the first time; however, I know other kids who love this video."
1,Misleading Advertisiing,"The description of this blade says it can cut aluminum, brass and sheet metals, but a CLOSE UP of the photo reveals it's clearly printed on the blade ""not for use with ""concrete, masonry or METALS."" Bad, bad bad people!"
3,Pretty okay,"I've been eating Matouks Calypso for years, it's probably my favorite sauce. I thought it's so good that I wanted to try another one.This one had really good reviews various places and some people said they like it better, which was not the case with me.I like it, but I prefer the flavor of the calypso sauce."
5,Great flavor and fire!,You absolutely cant go wrong with Matouks sauce. Have been using it for years a little goes a long way with great flavor.
4,"Not their best, but good",Salsa Picante hot pepper sauce is not my favorite Matouk's scotch bonnet sauce. I like the Calypso pepper sauce better.
3,"Just another winter blade, it's ok.","I've owned winter blades before and this one is nothing special. It works just like any other winter blade. When I first installed them they chattered and after break-in they streak just like other blades. The important thing is the ice doesn't freeze inside the frame, the rubber boot keeps them flexible after a winter storm. I'm glad I didn't pay retail because then I'd be disappointed. But for the price I paid on Amazon, they'll do for winter use."
4,"A Religious Earth, Wind & Fire","I was pleasantly surprised when I had the opportunity to listen to this CD recently. The music reminds me of Earth, Wind & Fire, with layers of many different instruments creating ribbons & threads of music. Highlights include ""Right Here At Home"", ""I've Got Joy"", ""All I Need To Know"" and ""I'll Stand For You"". It's worth a listen!"
4,GE Optical Mini Mouse this is a neat item,it is a little small but i like it and you actually do have to have drivers for it to work on Win 98se just make sure you unistall all other mouse drivers in use first espacilly other GE Mice drivers took me a bit to figure that out but o well got it to work :-)(drivers are on the win98se disc they come up crystal optical mouse and then you install the GE mouse software) if you have your comp in your bedroom and leave it on it the wheel light makes a good nitelight hehe if ya want something small and cool get this but stay away from it if ya have bad hands or really big hands ok i am out of here
1,I liked it for two weeks...,"I would agree with most reviews here - this is a decent little mouse for the price. However, mine broke after 2 weeks of use. As far as I can tell, the cable has had a failure and can't send a signal anymore. Very aggrivating - I will be buying a better constructed replacement."
2,Mistaken purchase,I wanted a DVD of Bob Marley and I thought it was all him. Instead it was him and 3 others.
2,Very poor,None of the comedians on this DVD blew up. What a waste of my money. All the comedians failed dismally to give me a giggle.
1,did not receive item,the item never did show up. There was a mix up in my address and so i beliebe it was returned. I don't believe I have been billed I hope not.
4,Very entertaining,"It's funny how we watch movies without always knowing there is a novel behind the plot, that the story was not just the product of some screenwriter's imagination. I have watched the original movie version with Walter Matthau countless times and never knew about the novel. I came across it on Amazon, borrowed the audiobook and loved it. Great action, excellent suspense, well worth the time. I preferred the ending in the Walter Matthau's movie version though."
2,"a fair quality tale, but of dated perspective","A novel of only fair quality that is dated in its awkward handling of characters of different ethnicities. The plot idea is clever and imaginative, but the 1974 movie with Walter Matthau carries it out better than does the book."
3,Not the right edition,"The description said it was not the movie edition and that is was an older edition, that is why I specifically picked this item. I did not want the movie edition. Either way good condition and an exciting book."
4,Suspenseful thriller,"I picked up this book because of the publicity from the movie. A thriller about 4 men who hijack a New York City subway train for $1 million, it is interesting and exciting. It is a quick read, and the chapters are divided into sections based on different characters' points of views.I found the formation of the plan and the execution from different lenses interesting, as well as the escape plan. Not all characters have depth and dimension, but is balanced with the character formation of Ryder (the leader of the hijackers) and Longman. The only negative about the book in my opinion is that there were too many characters to keep track of. It took me a few seconds to figure out who was who, who was a hostage and who was DCI.Overall it was enjoyable, although I think some parts were a bit slow."
3,Showing its age,"One of the more interesting things while reading this book was how people thought and reacted before terrorism became something we all now live with. The increased security and surveillance we now accept as the norm would have been tossed out as a crazy idea by the characters of the book.I had read the book many years ago and remembered it as enjoyable and did enjoy reading it again, it is an easy read but not a book you can't put down."
3,Can be much improved with the employment of a good editor,"I do appreciate the author's good intent of writing on the spiritual meanings or purposes of waiting. However, I am obliged to say that this book could be much improved with the employment of a good editor who could advise on her wording and writing. IMHO, the phrase ""loss of control"", which the author counted as one of the seven spiritual gifts, can be replaced by more appropriate phrase. In short, okay for common believers, but better for church leaders who can benefit more from the last two chapters on ""How to use this book with a group"" and the detailed plan for a daily ""Retreat: Spirituality of waiting""."
3,Broad theological views,"We are using this book for a group Bible study. The author's writing style is easy to follow. However, the title of the book is slightly deceptive. This book does not speak on actual spiritual gifts - but that is given away in the list of topics if one pays careful attention to the details. The book also is not Bible-based. The author uses a variety of spiritual ideas adopted by the world to make her points. It is important for the Christian reader to not get lost in the wordly views expressed and keep focused on the Truths that are touched upon and use other Biblical sources in conjuction with this book to truly grow in relationship with Christ as you experience waiting with a new perspective."
5,Removed scratches on the front bumper of my Prius,"This product is great! I bumped into the car in front of my while parallel parking on a hill (will never do that again) and scratched my bumper. The bump was strong enough to break my front license plate holder and leave a little line of tally mark-like scuffs and scratches to my bumper. Luckily, the scratches were shallow enough that I could not feel them with my fingernails (this is the test of whether Scratch X will work). I went to Target, bought some Scratch X and a foam applicator, and worked the cream into my bumper. The scratches pretty much disappeared and I can no longer see any indication of damage until my face is 2 centimeters from the bumper.The label says that the remover is safe for all clear coats and this seemed to be the case for my dark blue Prius. I was worried that it would make the clear coat cloudy but everything looked perfect after I wiped off the excess product.I definitely recommend this product for shallow scratches!"
1,Does nothing.,"This stuff does not work. I used it on my truck that had small scratches on it and it didn't do a thing. If anything, the scratch remover made the scratch even more noticeable. I rubbed it in like the bottle says and wiped it clean with a microfiber cloth. Did nothing."
3,Marginal,As others have said don't expect miracles. Applied to minor scratches and only saw moderate improvement; most were still visible.
4,Scratch x,If you are ready for wax on and wax of for like a 5 session the product will do the job my car was scratch with a key and very dip so the dealer give me some matching pen paint I used the pen paint leaved for 3 days then used the scratch for about 5 times and my car look like nothing ever happen. the scrath absobe the extra paint and leave the mark invisible. So like I said there is no miracle you have to worked out.
5,Amazing!,I got a sample a year ago and never tried it until the other day. I was able to get off all of these horrible marks and stains from my car.It was very easy. I almost paid lots of money to get a wax Thankfully I tried this first. My car is shiny and looks great. I love this product and the price is also really good.If you are thinking about it definetly give it a try.
2,Bad Product,"I have bought one of these to conceal some small scratches. My Initial reaction was that it it worked well butafter a rainy day my initial assumptions proved to be wrong. Water brought every single scratch back to its initial condition.Save money and don't buy this product. I would recommend Quixx, it works really well."
3,Meguiar's G10307 Scratch X 2.0,"Had some really nasty swirl marks on the daughter's car, as she used the kitchen pot scrubber to remove some sap. Thought that this would be able to remove the marks, but it was not totally successful. It did reduce the amount of the scratches, and works great on lighter scratches and swirl marks on a car, but slightly deeper scratches will probably require something stronger. Eventually ended up getting a cut polish done on the swirl marks.Oh, I used a orbital polisher with this product, but good old muscle power works just as well (in removing lighter scratches, and lighter swirl marks."
3,good scratch remover,this is a decent scratch remover. it doesn't seem to remove some of the lighter scratches on the car as you think it would.
1,It doesn't work,"It only works for minor hairline scratches. These tiny scratches can also be removed by the regular car wax (Eagle 1 nanowax, Nu Finish). Some of my scratches does not even cut through the clear coat but this product fails to remove it! I was disappointed with other reviews. I used to have Eagle 1 scratch remover that comes in a round can with screw top. It is like wax paste and it worked! I guess Eagle 1 has discontinue that product."
1,Do not use on new car,"Someone online suggested this product to me on removing the water spot on my black Acura TL. Unfortunately, it did not work at all. The car is less than 2 month old. After applying the product onto the area where I wanted, IT DID NOT REMOVE ANYTHING BUT MY ORIGINAL PAINT!!!! yes, the paint fade out a little, and cause the area look lighter than the surrounded.If you love your car, you'll know how paintful and regret I am now.Maybe I do not use it the right way, but if have a deep color car, don't risk it!"
3,What is a scratch?,"The surface scratches that I hoped to get rid of with this, did not work for my scratches. I have used this on real surface scratches with success."
3,Doesn't work as expected.,"I had some large scratches, that I filled with touch up and wanted to polish the surface (the paint of touch up wasn't used too much, it was just visible).I tried to remove the extra paint to make it more smooth and then I intended to use a wax, for making it more invisible. After struggling for 20 minutes, I gave up, seems this product isn't intended for such cases. Though according to other reviews there are some cases when it might work."
3,"Works well for light to (somewhat) medium scratches, but creates a haze","A car's mirror had scraped the side of my truck; fortunately, the black marks were only on the surface. So, after some researching, I kept hearing how great Meguiar's Scratch X was at removing marks and scratches. Well, that's only partly true. It would not remove the black marks left by the mirror. So, I ended up using Turtlewax Rubbing Compound and it completely removed the black marks and (as should always be expected when using a rubbing compound) left some very minor scratches on the paint/clear coat surface.So, this is when I used the Meguiar's Scratch X. Initially, I didn't think it worked at all, but after applying 4 coats of Scratch X, the scratches disappeared.However, the Scratch X caused what appeared to be hazing in the areas I applied it. After several coats of Polish and Wax in the same area, the haze is gone."
1,"Not a scratch remover, but a shiner","This product is meant to remove scratches from plastic, but all it does is give your plastic items a shine. I bought this product believing in web videos demonstrating a scratch being removed, I guess it was all a fake. That is my case, unless the original formula was changed. It will not REMOVE SCRATCHES."
1,This is a filler and does not remove swirl marks.,I had my car for less than a year and my mother backed into it with her car when backing out of her garage. I got it fixed and the body shop left swirl marks in the clearcoat. I've already taken it back twice and they even repainted it because of a paint mismatch and they still left swirl marks. It's getting exhausting dealing with them so I thought I would try this. I used as directed and even followed with the wax that was recommended in the directions and it seemed to work and I was so pleased. Then the next time I washed it the swirl marks were visible once again. I'm so irratated about it I'm considering trading it in already.
1,Avoid,"This is not a rub on, buff off product, like wax. It takes a lot of rubbing against the scratch.It appears to be doing more harm than good, adding scratches to my fairly dark vehicle. I'm using it by hand with a foam applicator, which never has scratched my finish when waxing. I find the results of a good coat of wax do a better job and don't add additional swirlmark scratches like this stuff. It may work better with a power buffer. By hand, it's pretty useless."
1,Didn't do anything,"I purchased this product to do... something, but it didn't hide or conceal the light scratches in my clear coat any better than a thick coat of paste wax did.In short, if you're looking to remove scratches, investigate another product."
