2,Too small and awkward,"While cute, this little pan is difficult to use. There's no room to use a spatula, so you'd better like the eggs cooked through - you can't flip for over easy, and the egg white is too deep to do sunny-side up. Also the handle gets hot and the little plastic egg bit is not enough to grip, so you have to use a potholder. Plus, it's so small that it won't fit any normal-sized burner - another burn risk to your fingers."
1,Don't buy This!,"Not only is this pan unbalanced (the weight of the handle tips it over), it is terribly made. The first time I cracked an egg in it, after a few seconds of cooking I noticed black flecks in the egg - it was the non-stick coating on the pan! The coating had chipped off and was floating in the egg. Don't waste your money."
2,"Very cute, but doesn't work","I bought this pan and it looks lovely as an ornament in my kitchen. It never worked for cooking, it's to small and difficult to cook in. The biggest problem I had was that the handle is to heavy and the pan too small, so it is not balanced and tilts over. If you like how it looks and want to display it in your kitchen, buy it. If your looking for an egg or pancake pan, don't waste your money!"
1,TERRIBLE PAN,"I make my husband an egg bagle sandwich most mornings so I thought this would be handy as it's so small - DO NOT BUY. Even with using non stick spray on a teflon surface it is terrible. I did however purchase the Starfrit Eco Pan and it works very very well so I ordered 2 and gave away this dumb thing. Here is the link to the significantly better small egg pan.Starfrit Eco Pan 5.5 Inch Mini Egg Pan, Black"
2,not a very good nonstick,"My wife bought this a while ago. I like a one-egg sandwich in the morning.The first time I used it, I sprayed it with a non-stick spray, just as I do with all of our nonstick pans.The egg stuck to the pan and I had to scrape it out. The egg was a mess and the pan required scrubbing to get it clean.Each time thereafter, the egg stuck pretty much the same way.This pan reminds me of the nonstick pans when they came some 50 or so years ago. Most then did not perform as advertised.It is cute but performs poorly. It is not worth the money we paid for it."
5,ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!,"My daughter gave me this little pan for Mother's Day and at the time, I thought it was cute and a little gimmicky, but I doubted that I'd use it much. After all, how useful could such a tiny pan be? But I gave it a try, and have come to really, really love it. It is the perfect size for a single egg, although it will hold two eggs at a time, and it makes perfectly round eggs for a sandwich. And it's fun to use. I can't help but smile when I'm using it. I had to come find the pans on amazon so that I could buy another pan so that I can cook two eggs at a time. Lots of fun, great non-stick surface, a fun little kitchen gadget!"
2,scary fumes,"I basically like the one egg fry pan. With patience and pratice and a small spatula I am able to turn the egg over. The egg is the perfect size for a croissant or a English muffin. However, even though I use the smallest flame on my simmer gas burner, the handle gets extremely hot and emits a disconcerting burnt metal smell. The silver band on the handle has become discolored. I am afraid that the handle is emiting toxic chemicals. If I can find another one egg frying pan, I will toss this one."
2,"Perfect size, but cheaply made!","This pan works perfectly for making a fried egg for a breakfast sandwich, but I was very disappointed when the Teflon started wearing away! I never use metal utensils when I cook so that was not the issue. Obviously a seven dollar pan is not well-made, but I'm concerned about the safety of my family ingesting the Teflon! I loved the pan, until it started peeling. Don't waste your money."
5,Excellent pan!,"I found this pan at our local grocery store and love it! I know other reviewers said there are flaws, but I have not found any issues with it (and plan to purchase one for my mother). Easy to use, perfect size for making an egg & cheese sandwich for breakfast. I spray oil on the pan before adding the egg, cook most of the egg on the first side (and loosen sides once while cooking on that side), then flip, a bit more cooking, and voila! Love it, and highly recommend it. I have no problems using our spatula (I use OXO's flexible, plastic (heat-tolerant) one, and the pan handle has not gotten hot to my touch (2 other reviews mentioned these as issues, which I have not encountered). Great item!"
2,Quickly broken,"This product's handle broke off within a week of using it. It did manage to successfully fry an egg once though. And I guess the little egg face is cute, but really, don't buy this thing."
3,Pretty good!,"Wow, I can't believe all the problems that were reported with this pan. I had no problems with the eggs sticking, they cooked picture perfect, it was easy to use and clean up. I also didn't have any problems with the handle, but I used my 6 inch burner to avoid potential burns. I was satisfied with this product and would recommend it for quick and easy eggs."
1,"Cute, but that's about it.","Issue #1 I have a large gas stove with grates on the burners. This skillet is so small it is always falling between them.Issue #2 The non-stick coating? Not non-stick, and definitely not durable. Somehow, I managed to scratch the coating with a soft plastic spatula.Issue #3 I like to be able to grab the a skillet with one hand and with a quick motion of the wrist, flip the egg in the air(without the aid of a utensil.) Not possible here, as the sides of the pan are not sufficiently curved and on top of that everything STICKS to the surface (see Issue #2.)I LOVE CUTE KITCHEN GADGETS, but this one is really not practical. I bought this to cook appropriately-sized eggs for bagel sandwiches. But alas, the eggs are so mangled after scraping them out of this, they're not even close to the right shape!"
1,"Spatula good, Pan not good","The pan is poorly designed. I like the small ""one-egg"" size, but the sides are 90 degrees to the bottom. Getting an egg out is a nightmare. I trashed the pan. I kept the cute little spatula."
1,"Poorly produced, more junk for the landfill","I confess that I was taken by how ""cute"" this pan is, and very enthusiastic about the size--perfect for a single fried egg, or for quickly browning some garlic. But this pan is so poorly designed and manufactured that I'm sorry I bought it. Even though I'm very careful with it, the teflon scratches easily (and now, we're hearing more and more from the government about the dangers of non-stick coatings). Furthermore, the pan is actually too thin to make a good egg, and the handle, which is clumsy in its size, gets VERY hot. I have a lot of house guests, so I even took the precaution of writing HOT with a sharpie all over the the little egg decoration--not so ""cute"" anymore.To conclude, I would say that this is just one more piece of junk to clutter our landfills. Look in your kitchen: you probably have a perfectly good pan at home already. Wish I'd thought of that before I bought this product."
1,Not safe!,"I am very disappointed in this pan. Not only does the handle get hot but I found that he pan occassionally throws sparks! I also get a funny smell when I cook with it, even when I keep the stove on low and food sticks to it. I had to throw mine away and am not shopping for a higher-quality pan."
3,Non stick needs improving,"I decided to wait to create this review to see if the pan would hold up over time.I've used the pan about 30 times so far. Seemed to work great for the first 20 times, but the eggs are sticking now.The non stick is VERY easily damaged too. Several times lately I've had to use a spatula to remove the egg and now have scratching on the non-stick. Non stick these days should be able to handle a metal spatula. I've had my current non-stick cookware for 10 years now and it holds up well.I was going to give this a 2 star review, but since my only complaint was the non stick surface I decided to give it 3 stars. I'm feeling generous I guess.This pan would be perfect for me if the non stick was better. Even spraying with cooking spray, it seems the more I use this the more the egg sticks."
1,not happy,"i bought this pan because i really like omelets but they are a pain to make. i bought this thinking, at last i can have a good omelet . what a joke. it is not non-stick and it just is cheap junk. sorry manufacturer about that, but it is true."
1,Don't buy it,"Cooking temp. is uneven. Makes no difference if you use oil or cooking spray, eggs still stick and burn easily to the non-stick surface.Interior of pan is harder to clean than a non-stick surface should ever be. Eggs difficult to remove. Handle is heavier than the pan making it prone to tipping and spilling. Bottom line: Don't buy it. It's useless and worthless. Man-up and select a bigger, better pan."
2,Cute...but doesn't work as well as I expected!,"This is adorable...I love the little egg! It is actually my 2nd one. I ruined the first one...totally my fault by placing it on a styrofoam plate when it was still hot - OOPS! The handle on that first one got SO hot! You had to use a pot holder. My second one is a little different. The handle is insulated so it does not get hot. GREAT! However, I've used it about 20 times and the non-stick stuff isn't very non-stick anymore! Because of this it is difficult to clean. It still works ok - I just use TONS of cooking spray."
1,"burned fingers from below, it's all bad...","first - there is a screw or bolt attaching the handle to the pan that is exposed on the underside that heats up as hot as the pan, and i repeatedly burn my index finger on this. you won't see it, as it's on the underside, and plus it's at about a third of the way up the handle, exactly at a place where your index finger will encounter it. as others have said, you'll need an oven mit for this, which is ridiculous.second- the balance, as mentioned, is so off that the handle is so heavy that it makes the pan tip over, especially bad since it already is so much smaller than any burner.third- it is not nonstickfourth- it comes with scratches and divets in it, brand newfifth- it is horrible for trying to do sunny side up or over easyi bought this at a store thinking it would be awesome for eggg bagel sandwiches. i was more than disappointed.i strongly suggest that you not buy this!"
2,"Convenient size, but not the best quality product.","A very convenient-sized pan, but not without its defects. The handle of the pan, which is all metal, heats up along with the pan itself, so you need to wear an oven mitt or something to be able to lift/move the pan. The non-stick coating isn't all that great to begin with, but I've owned my pan for probably a year now and at this point the non-stick is ineffective. Everything sticks.If you're considering a different comparable-sized pan, you're probably better off buying it instead of this one."
1,form over function,"While this pan is cute, it's completely useless. It's unbalanced so the handle tips it over. It is NOT nonstick. Even with a generous piece of butter, my eggs got demolished when I tried to pry them free from the ""non-stick"" surface. Probably worst of all, the handle got extremely hot in a very short period of time!I also have the plastic orange spatula of the same set, and it melted after a couple of uses. That is in the trash too.It's great when cute product design is actually functional, but Joie has failed with these items."
1,don't waste your money,Like most of these folks said - no matter how much oil or cooking spray you use - it sticks every time - even with a lower temperature
1,Complete crap,"It is supposedly a ""non-stick"" pan but in reality, it is not. Everything, especially eggs are sticking to it like hell and while trying to clean it the non-stick material peels off. I just trashed it after a few uses. It is a useless cheap product, stay away from it."
2,"After 2 months, egg sticks","I bought this mini fry pan because of it's proposed function - we eat breakfast at different times, so the one-egg pan was perfect. Then I discovered that I needed a small spatula. The store where I purchased the pan did not have the spatula so I shopped around town until I found a small silicone spatula that worked. On a gas stove burner, if the handle is not turned to balance on the prongs, it easily tips over. Now, after just over 2 months, the egg is starting to stick to the bottom of the non-stick surface. This is so disappointing. When it gets too frustrating, I'll just throw it away, but I won't buy another one."
2,There are no lids.,"One of the pans was bent, still useable, yet bent. Quality seems ok, yet would have preferred unbent pan and rating would have been higher. I ordered this set because it was described as coming with lids. There are no lids."
5,A very nice ring at a very nice price,"I would suggest getting at least a half size larger than you usually do, because stone rings don't have any ""give"" like metal rings do. I'm not positive this ring is actually onyx, but it's still very pretty. It also came in a cute little gift box. I'm very happy with this ring."
3,it's exactly what i was looking for but...,it's exactly what i was looking for but it turns out that there's a store in town that have the item but at a lower cost. so i would recommend looking around your area first but i still have this item 6 month later :]
5,beautiful ring,what a beautiful ring! I'm very sensitive to all types of metal so i was looking for something that is simple and beautiful that wasn't metal to wear as a wedding band! This caught my and my husbands eye! Very fast shipping and a great product! Thank you
5,onyx ring,"This black onyx ring is simply beautiful but I did accidentally drop it on ceramic tile flooring. The ring did not shatter to pieces but only sustained a small chip and that impressed me. While the chip is very small, I do intend to order this excelently priced item again."
4,Very Pleased,"I wa very pleased withthis ring.It arrived in great condition ,early,and was very well pakaged I wold buy fro this company again."
5,"Simple, yet elegant","This is a simple, yet elegant ring. It came in its own gift box, which surprised me. I love the feel of the band, and how it keeps its luster even after wearing it all day. I highly recommend it."
2,Cool,"I like this magazine, but it got really tiresome quickly! Was so big to read I never had time to finish!"
1,Dissapointed,"This item is short in length, the hand control is lacking many feature of the Homedics BMS-10, lacks heat, vibration is almost completely dissipated in the SQUSH and padding, and there is no cross stiching so the SQUSH falls to the bottom of the channel if used in a chair (upright position). IF ANYONE KNOWS WHERE WE CAN FIND THE HOMEDICS MODEL BMS-10H please email us at mgrw@c2i2.com. If their was a zero that is what this product deserves in comparison to all of the other product of this type we have used over the last 15 years. Mike & Genny"
4,My husband likes it!,My husband has a bad back and when straining it uses this mat and says it does help.
3,Nice but not great,"the massage given by this mat was nice, but not as deep and relaxing as the description would be to expect. I will keep this item, but not use it as often as I had hoped."
4,Very comfortable,This mat is cushioned all the way and feels very comfortable even if it is swithced off. It has a nice pillow with it for effective neck massage.Only problem i felt is its length is less compared to the other massager mats of this same brand. It covers only upto your knees.
4,Massage Away,The Massaging Body Mat can be very addicting.....it soothes your muscles and relaxes you. Very happy I purchased it!
2,Disappointing !!,"This book has disappointed me. The authors could have included some real life cases on NPD. The ""handbook"" tag is highly misleading. For example : One would tend to compare it with Juran's Quality Handbook.Also the foucus in this book is more on New Product Launch and less on real product designing."
3,good but VERY OVERPRICED,"let me begin by saying this is a really good album. if you have heard 'nature of the experiment' and 'citizens' dont worry that those are the only two or even the best songs on the cd. they're not and the whole album is really good. my main problem is that it is very overpriced. I had tried finding it at Best buy before but they didn't have it. I finally saw it and it was only 10 bucks so I quickly snatched it up. Well, there's only 7 songs and the entire cd runs about 15 mins. So 10 bucks for 15 mins left me feeling kinda of cheated, but if you can get past that the album itself is very good. maybe download it on itunes for cheaper."
3,Good old-fashioned songs by the original artists,"If you are into classic old songs, by the people that made them famous, this is the album for you. It's a load of all the great singers, who sang these great melodies, if your in the mood for Dietrich, Astaire, Maurice Chevalier, Glenn Miller, this is definetly the best I've heard from all of them."
1,Terrible,"Sorry, but this is 2005 and this game sucks. Even in 1995 this would be a poor game. I would have given it zero stars, if that was an option. With games like Rome - Total War out there, I can't say enough bad things about Alexander. It's obviously a marketing scam to sucker money from people based on the movie and appeal for these types of games. The people who developed and marketed it should be shot."
4,Porper Shaft Polisher,"Decent product. Does not do all that it claims. Chalk residue still remains on shaft, the only thing that actually removes the chalk is sandpaper. The shaft polisher is good right before a game to smooth out the shaft. Quick delivery. Porper makes excellent products but this is not their best."
3,Just a padded wiping cloth,"Nothing too special here. It wipes the cues down nicely, but nothing a good cloth can't do. At least no one will walk away with it in their pocket."
3,Not the best.,I bought this and used it for quite awhile and was never very impressed with it. Now I have found the q-wiz and am much happier using that for almost all of my shaft caring needs.
4,Interaction of the physical and biological world,"This three part series explores the relationship between the physical world and the biological world, including human culture. It is excellent for teaching geography or biology or earth science."
1,0 Stars - I actually threw this out,"20pp on what a great int'l fencing photographer he is, followed by fluff, then a rehash of some digital darkroom basics. Absolutely a disappointment; publisher's marketing group pulled one on us with this title.(BTW, great work in the photos; sounds like a good guy)"
2,Nothing More than Common Sense,"If you're brand new to shooting sports or photography in general, then this isn't a bad book. It covers alot of the basics acrss different sports that if you'r not familar is a decent introduction. However, if you've ever been on a sideline shooting as I have for the last few years - you'll learn very little new that will make you're pictures better. I learned more in a 20 minute conversation with a real sports journalist than I did reading the book. My recommendation is to rent this one from the library or buy it used if you have to have it. My copy is now for sale on ebay."
1,Where do you get those ideas?,"I'm a sports photographer and shoot a lot of soccer and baseball games. Of these two sports, I totally disagree with this book's approach. I tried to return this book to Amazon but can't."
5,Extremely Useful!,"This book is divided into sections covering nearly every kind of sport, and each one features a set of standard tips for setting up, assessing exposure, and getting a dramatic shot that fits with the nature of the particular sport you're shooting. I've already found it to be extremely useful for shooting my daughter's soccer games, and I'm looking forward to using it to get some cool skiing shots this winter. I noticed another review here where the writer has critiqued some contradictory advice regarding monitors, using Photoshop, etc. That may or may not be true. At any rate, I haven't noticed. What I *have* noticed is that this book is packed with information you can put to work for great results immediately. I recommend this highly."
4,"Nice, but not as pretty as the picture.","It's very nice but looks kind of flat as opposed to the picture here at Amazon, where it looks a bit rounder and more detailed. Still, very pretty and my wife loves it. Off to the next Ren Faire!"
4,great for all types of adoptions,"I bought this book for our 3 sons, all of whom are adopted. It is great for both our 6 & 8 yr. olds. Eventhough the story is about a girl adopted from China, it is not specific to that type of adoption. Our boys were adopted here in the U.S., but the content of the story is broad and talks about basic adoption issues but specifically that she knows she is loved. Every year in November I take a day at our school and read adoption books to grades K-5. This book was a favorite for almost every class. They enjoyed it so much we got one to donate to the school library."
2,Not very durable,"My 3-year-old loved this toy, but the battery compartment in the rear tinder was easily opened (no screw securing it), and so the battery was always falling out, and getting lost along with the lid to the battery compartment. Then, there are wires going from the rear to the front engine car, and over time they break, rendering the toy useless. The Henry is designed the same way, and the same thing happened to us with that one."
1,Outdated Book,"I'm sure this was a good book when it was written back in 1996!!! 5 years later, this book is very outdated and very unhelpful."
3,"Interesting, Readable, But Far From Compelling","Interesting, highly readable, but ultimately pretty inconsequential, ""Citizen Vince"" attempts to tell the story of crime and redemption as personified by the title character, a man in the FBI's witness protection program. He's sort of half trying to go straight, but is still involved with stealing credit card numbers. Fans of such crime novelists like Elmore Leonard might find this of more than a passing interest, but if you are looking for tales of redemption surrounding morally ambiguous characters you'd be a lot better off checking out the masterworks of Graham Greene who did this stuff much more compelling and more convincingly. Not bad, but not exceptional either."
4,intriguingly balanced between humor and gritty realism,"[***** = breathtaking, **** = excellent, *** = good, ** = flawed, * = bad]In 1980, Vince is a former con-man now in the Witness Protection Program in Spokane WA, and he fears his past may be catching up to him. Absorbing and often hilarious. Longer review at ImpatientReader-dot-com."
4,A cut above,More than you expect. And that's a good thing. The author creates characters that ring true and drag you along.
4,"Great character, great plot","This is the second book I've read by Jess Walter. I love the realism of his characters and the inventiveness of his plots. Vince is a flesh-and-blood character you can visualize even if you'd never inhabit his world. There's nothing predictible or trite about this book, it kept me fascinated to the very end."
4,"I Vote, Therefore I am","Vince Camden is a new man living in a new town courtesy of the FBI. Vince is a low level crook from NYC who becomes part of the witness protection program and is relocated to his new life in Spokane Washington. Vince is on his way to becoming a model citizen. He has a legit job running a donut shop. He reads many books, well, the first 50 pages of many books anyway. The setting is 1980 and Vince is interested in the politics of the day and the upcoming Presidential election between Jimmy carter and Ronald Reagan serve as a backdrop throughout. Vince is intelligent and introspective, he cares about people and he cares about the world. He has the makings of a fine upstanding citizen, so what if he makes extra cash selling drugs and stolen credit cards. So what if his friends are hookers and gamblers. Vince is a good guy making a new start, until his past catches up with him. With writing and story a cut above the regular crime novel I really liked this one."
3,Fun Read,"A little predictable but a few surprises too. I'm not sure I buy the ""redemptive"" nature of the principal character. At times it seamed like a death wish instead of seeking to change his old ways."
4,Recommendable reading,"Enjoyable reading, not much of a crime/mystery novel in a pure sense of the meaning, there are other issues mixed into the plot (e.g. redemption, politics). Nevertheless it is pretty good book to read, even though one might not exactly agree with the author's line of thinking (as expressed in the novel)."
2,"Highly Readable, But Not Highly Memorable","It's hard to exactly know what to make of this book. It is generally well written. The author has a way of using clever turns of phrases and the prose is rarely awkward or stilted. One the other hand the plotting is, while engaging not particularly captivating. Voting as a form of redemption? Well...maybe...but I don't know. That was a mite too anticlimactic for me and the chapters that tried to capture what was going on inside the thoughts of Carter and Reagan in the Sunday before the 1980 presidential election seemed forced and a little half baked.Readable, but utimately less than satisfying and not particularly memorbale.2 1/2 stars."
5,mystery book review,I found this book intellectually intriguing. I purchased it based on the award it received. I have ordered additional titles by this author as a result of reading this one.
1,Citizen Vince PS,Not a bad read. Pretty good plot and reasonably well written. I was left wondering a bit about the point or if it was supposed have one. Perhaps not.
4,Interesting,I Read this for book club in February. Easy to read and kept me wanting to read it more and more.
3,A nightmare on film,"Have you ever gone to bed right after a meal of hot, spicy food? Did you keep waking up and going back to sleep again? That gives you an idea what this movie is like. It feels like one of those surreal ""waking dreams"". I don't know any other way to describe it. If you've seen David Lynch's Eraserhead or Luis Bunuel's An Andalousian Dog, then you might have an idea what I mean. Don't expect it to make any sense, at least not in an orderly, linear way. You have to be in the right mood for this one."
2,ok ok ok i get it you want to be David Lynch,"Well this little art house flick left me wondering what i just seen and why i wasted 2hrs to see it. The film is shot so terribly that it gets to the point of annoyance. The plot to this movie i have no idea, the horror in the movie laughable i really don't understand the hype that this movie is getting on here.if you are a horror fan especially disturbing movies like cannibal holocaust or i spit on your grave things of that nature this movie will leave you bored and wondering where 2 hrs of your time just went. i know i keep saying 2hrs and that may be the biggest problem with this movie. the length and filming with strobe lights camera angles that make no sense black and white grain every 5mins a half lit screen most of the movie just gets annoying after about 20mins let alone 2hrs.hate to say it but this is one of them film festivil arthouse flicks that got way over its head and way over rated on here."
1,Are you kidding me?,"People gave this movie 5 stars? What, are you the producers or something? This is one of the worst ""movies"" i've ever seen, if you can even call it a movie. If you like absolutely terrible trance music and scenes that drag on too for lack of good editing, maybe. The cover for this looked awesome, but i couldn't wait until it was over. It took me four or five times to get through it, no lie. The plot is stupid, the acting is terrible, and half the scenes are just strobe lights and sound effects in a club. Buy something better with your money."
1,Don't Bother,"This movie was impossible to follow or understand...there were some cool graffics, but other than that, it blew moose balls. Sorry Landry...Maybe if I ate 5 hits of acid it would have made sense."
2,disappointing,"I purchased this because a) it has been compared favorably to E. Elias Merhige's Begotten and b) I liked the title and cover. Unfortunately, it bore little resemblance to Begotten aside from being gross and weird, which is not necessarily a laudable thing per se. Although I liked the opening sequence featuring the character on the cover, the movie descended into total ridiculousness and empty shock value really quickly. About three quarters of the movie take place in a Russian goth club where some guy has apparently taken some bad acid. There are flashing strobe lights and dizzying camera movements that seem to go on and on forever, with the occasional scenes of necrophilia and a woman being repeatedly punched in the face thrown in for good measure. This would all be fine and good if there seemed to be some central purpose or theme to the whole thing, but there just isn't. Save your money."
5,Great movie but you need to know the Russian language,"Very interesting movie. Only problems was I could not find the English subtitles. I tried and tried in the extras section and could not find it, even though it says that it is there on the box. Good part for me is I'm studying Russian. If I have the subtitles, I probably will probably not try to translate. For me it is a great movie and a way to practice my Russian language. Vampires in this movie is a little different than the common one most horror fans know of. These are more like creatures that attack you when you sleep through your dreams. Hard to explain if the movie was in English. Main character is charismatic which helps the crazy jumping around in the movie."
2,Where are the subtitles???????,"Being a fanatic of foreign horror, especially surreal cinema, I've been chomping at the bit to watch Visions of Suffering when I first saw the trailer on Unearthed's website. I got my copy, dimmed the lights and pushed play, ready for a psychadelic rollercoaster of macabre imagery and surreal effects.Problem is, there are NO subtitles. And I don't speak Russian. This problem is compounded with the trailer having English subtitles and the back of the DVD cover clearly stating ""Russian soundtrack with removable English subtitles"".After inquiring with Unearthed about this, they got back to me immediately and said that some DVD players turn off the automatic subtitles for some reason and hitting the Subtitles button on your remote should do the trick. Didn't work for me but Unearthed is still looking into other possible solutions, which is unbelievably incredible customer service, hats off to Unearthed."
1,watch out,"Leo Yankevich, though born in Pennsylvania, styles himself a ""count."" ""Lamon Cull,"" by the way, who reviews this book favorably in one of the reviews here, is none other than Yankevich himself. The book shows a musical talent wasted on bizarre screeds. Don't bother."
1,Mr.,"Sadly, Leo is a racist of the first degree. A Google search for Leo Yankevich Jews, returns a plethora of interviews about how the Jews and Russians are destroying Western Civilization. The broken meter, common throughout, is laughable....don't bother supporting this hater."
4,Great Picks,"I love these picks. The grip on the picks really does help you keep a hold of them as your playing. These are really thin though, so if you're looking for a firmer pick, try finding some thicker ones. The only issue I had was the product picture shows 6 different colors of picks, but then says Light Grey in the product description. Color isn't a big deal, but it would be nice for them to change the picture to match the product more precisely."
4,A good book,"Although the book has been written from an American perspective, the written content and the photographs are well balanced. A reader may think that too much importance is given to United States. Yes and No. Yes, because the entry of United States changed the whole proportion of World War II. No, because a fair amount of coverage has been given to fighthing at other hemispheres (although from a birds eye view of an American).Winners write and rewrite history. This book has been written by United States. If you do not mind that, then it is a really fascinating book.The book is well balanced with writting and photographs potraying World War II. I felt it more like a movie.The book is a good one. I bought a old one in almost new condition for $10 and I never repented the money spent."
5,Great Book,"Wonderful pictures and a comprehensive, readable text make this one of the best world war two books out there."
1,"This is ""new"" history?","This is a work of absurd fluff. This is WW2 from a solipsistic, silly All-American perspective that really is a fantasy. 600 pages of WW2 ""history"" with 45! count'em-45 pages on the Eastern Front where the bulk of WW2 was actually fought. Its the same old boring photos we've all seen mixed with a an even more jingoistic editorial slant than the old American Heritage WW2 History. A more appropriate title would have been Stephen Ambrose's WW2 Fantasy; no pesky Russkies in this story."
3,Don't waste your money,"Don't get me wrong, the content of the single is pretty good, but you don't have to buy it, if you like the songs, they're all on the ""G sides"" album that you can buy for almost the same price. The single is just for big fans."
3,Great for learning; dismal for reference; rotten visually,"The first half of the book is a great tutorial on using the CGI.pm module. There are all sorts of tricks, and Lincoln's explanations are very good. If you want a tutorial, this is it.However, the reference section is a mess. It's not clear how the various functions are grouped, and there are no guides in page headings to tell you where you are as you thumb through. If you're looking for a desktop reference, you're probably better off using the CGI section of ""Perl In A Nutshell"".Finally, the book looks like it was thrown together in Word, with no real thought about how it would look. Chapter titles are in grey: Why?"
3,Information is invaluable but organization needs work,"This is an invaluable book for using an invaluable library module (if you do CGI coding). There is absolutely no substitute for CGI.pm. However, this book is very frustrating to use because the Reference Guide section is organized into different weird categories instead of just listing all the functions in CGI.pm in alphabetical order (like in Perl books, for example). Therefore the reader has to try to figure out what category a function in the module belongs in in order to look it up. Very very aggravating! In fact I trained a group of developers in using CGI.pm and many of them avoided using it because it takes so long to find what you're looking for in the reference section of the book. I am hoping for a new edition of the book SOON with this problem corrected. The material is invaluable, but I have to give three stars because of poor organization."
5,Easy Web Magic,"This book is so easy to read and understand.In about two days I was using cookies to maintain state, I have since writen a form mailer that puts data into csv, and a bunch of other cool stuff. EASY, a fast read, and you'll be able to jump right in and do a lot of cool stuff immediately."
2,man pages are designed better,"I've bought this book basically not to burn my eyes reading man pages from the screen. The text itself is good and is exactly what the title tells you - a printed user's manual to (most) popular Perl module.Now I have to ask: how on earth can a book be designed as poorly as that? Whoever the designer is, I'd strongly recommed him(her?) to buy ""The Form of the Book"" by Jan Tchicold (hope I spelled it correctly)."
5,so easy to use with a tiny effort,"we have spent a month every year in italy for 28 years. The first time we went, i did not buy the red guide because it wasin italian. WHAT A MISTAKE! i ended up throwing away the 2 guidebooks that i did buy instead. You only need to translate about 25 words that are used like the months and days of the week - and ""closed"" - then the guide becomes what it is - TRULYTHE BEST EUROPEAN GUIDE - nothing comes close. I now plan theitaly trips for all our friends, and their friends - and i usethe red guide exclusively. Don't be lazy - figure out this bookand you will be rewarded with the best hotel/restaurant/sightguide there is!"
3,"Not in English, but good if you want to work for the info","While I can understand the first reviewer's criticism, I can also understand the others here who say this book is helpful. Thing is, everything is in Italian. Yes, there are symbols and a key in English. However, all the descriptions for places are in Italian, and that does me no good. For [the price], a guide should have descriptions in the language I read... But, if you want to work and sort through the symbols and such, then this guide is an excellent source of information."
3,cartonish,Its a fun game over all the only complaint when you run out of ammo your done. You have to reload to the beginning.
3,"Difficult at first, but then got it.",I too found this book to be hard to understand at first. I thought I'd never get done with it. I decided not to let a book get the best of me so I really applied myself and soon I had the hang of it. The only thing I would have added to the book is more tests at the end.
4,Very pleased.,"This is the textbook I used in my Beginning Medical Transcription course and I found it to be very helpful. Audio cassette tapes were given out from the teacher with model operative, autopsy, H & P, cytology, and consultation reports that coincided with the lessons in the book. The terminology that was in each chapter was used frequently in the reports to assimilate the student with typing the words, as well as being able to hear it pronounced in different ways. It gave a background lesson in basic terminology, including suffixes and root words. I thought that this book helped me in great ways."
4,Second career?,"My daughter works with horses, makes very good money, but only works 20 hours a week. She was considering taking medical transcriptionist courses. I bought this book to give her a real taste of what the courses would be like. It would be a good additional career if she could work it around the horse training she loves and excels at. This book is perfect for anyone considering a medical transcriptionist career. I gives you a very clear idea what is involved in beginning transcription."
2,Hillcrest Medical Center Beginning Medical Transcription Course,"The book itself was great but when I tried the CD that it came with it would not work. I inserted in my PC and tried to download it but it does not work like it should. I really was disappointed in that,because that is actually why i ordered that book for is the CD so that i can have a tool to practice with."
4,Hilcrest Transcription,"This is exactly the book I was looking for. The information and examples are fully explained. My only criticism is that the book is specific to Hillcrest Medical Centers and affiliate care facilities. Other formats will most likely be used wherever I work but the information necessary for each document is explained. Before beginning with a new employer, I will get an example of their formats. But the information is perfect for me as someone learning the field. I see where this book will be used as reference in the future."
1,Horrible Video version,"I bought this hoping to get the BBC's 'Proms' summer series I saw a few years back. What I got was the worst 'Directors vision' of what he interpreted the video should be. For Holst's 'Mars the bringer of war', this Hack threw together a bunch of various armies marching and driving machinery around and setting up missiles. All of which was Stock footage. The stuff found in every editing lab laying on the floor -where it belongs. Instead of sticking to the theme (The PLANETS!!! REMEMBER?), he slaps together a heavy handed personal opinion of the world and it's constant termiol with war. All at the expense of the BBC who pays him. Hey Hack, no one gives a split pea about your opinion of war. Leave your opinion at home and stick to the program!!!! This guy is a real armature and shouldn't have ever been allowed to stand near the editing door let alone touch the equipment. The BBC should apologize for releasing such a politically swayed video of Holst great work.HORRIBLE."
3,Musically acceptable; visually bad,"I purchased this in the hope of giving my daughter a reasonable replacement experience for ""The Planets: An HD Odyssey"" as put on by the Seattle Symphony this past summer; she had to miss it because of a last minute trip, but, it was not to be. The musical performance is fine (though the level is very low; we had to turn it way up), but the video accompaniment is pretty poor. There's nothing inherently wrong with stock footage, but this was just bad quality stock footage. Frankly, it looks like somebody threw the video together in a week or so.I'm giving it 3 stars for the musical performance; it comes with a ""bonus CD"" of the performance, so at least you can rip it and put it on your iPod."
3,"decent book, lousy title","When Kate Cann initially wrote these books, she titled them (in order) ""Diving in"" ""In the deep end""(this one) and ""sink or swim"". This retitling seems like a lousy attempt to have an overused loud title and cash in on ""sex sells"". It may work, but I, for one, am unimpressed.Putting the title aside, I found the book itself quite decent."
5,Jazz & Beyond!,"This has 8 full-length music videos -- Herbie Hancock - Hardrock, Chuck Mangione - Diana ""D"", Al Dimeola - Sequencer, just to name a few."
4,"Good for Simple, Indoor set-ups","This product has been poorly marketed in my opinion. If you're looking to do table top set-ups with these lights, just as the other reviewer says, there are other, superior options, so don't bother.But if you buy the stands for them (a must!) they make great, simple lights for shooting indoor video. Things like interviews, or simple presentations, or low budget movies. They give off a good soft light, very little heat, and you can get daylight temperature bulbs to match the sunlight. So for indie filmmakers, or poor videographers shooting interviews who need something that isn't complete garbage, you could really get your money's worth. The only drawbacks here are the relatively low light output (though acceptable for most video), and they aren't conducive to repeated set-ups and tear downs - these aren't Arri HMI lights here that can take decades of abuse. But in the right situation, well worth the cost."
4,Does A Decent Lighting Job,"Bought this light set years ago and forgot to leave a review. Pretty easy to assemble and easy to use. Wish it was more compact - it takes up a lot of space on a table - but overall I'm pretty happy with it. It's not the most advanced or the most perfect lighting but it's better than regular household lighting and I've gotten some pretty professional looking results with it. if the price fits your budget, I think you'll be pleased with it."
4,Instant help for my grandson understand football in the NFL,A great book from the past. I gave the book to my grandson after I reread the book from a long time ago.
1,"Flat, cold sound","Ever lived next door to someone who loved to play music on their great sound system? Thats how these speakers sound. No, not like a great sound system -- like the sound coming through a wall. Everything I play on these speakers sounds flat, dull, and cold. They get loud, but who wants to listen to such numb speakers? It sounds like the music is coming through cardboard or a wall or something.NOT recommended at all. I've never had Sony speakers before, but if they can't make slightly decent speakers for this price I'm sure not going to pay them more for a better Sony system. I recommend Altec Lansing, Boston Acoustics, or Klipsch speakers if you can find some in this price range. Actually, anything should be better!"
4,A great primer to capitalism and economics,"I read this book because it was on the recommended list of Tom Woods. Woods was the author of ""Meltdown"" and I thought that was one of the best economic books I've read in some time. Essentials of Economics is just that, some of the basic ideas of our capitalistic economic system. I loved the simplicity of the basic economic ideas and with it's Austrian school of economic slant, it really resonated with me. It's a very short guide to the basics but it's efficent and laser like focused on steering the reader to Austrian science."
2,Its ok,"It was ok for its use, but kind of cheap quality. Mostly light weight plastic. Instruction book not very helpful with features."
3,Shingles Prevention,"I bought it because I had chicken pox as a kidand I read that lysine will help with keepingShingles at bay.Does it work, I have no clue.It does have a strong garlic smell when you openit and when you take it you'll be smelling garlicall day. It also has more than lysine in the ingredients.You also have to take three at a time which is1500mg of lysine. So it means you actually get 60doses. I have amazon prime and beleive I bought itfrom Amazon. If I didn't buy from Amazon,the delivery was still fast. 3 stars for delivery."
5,Makes My Body a Little Easier to Live With,"It would be nicer not to need this kind of supplement, but for me it has helped. I will buy it again when needed."
2,Produces Gas,"I've used ""plain"" lysine a great deal. It did not produce gas. This product caused problematic gas, perhaps due to the non-lysine nutrients added."
5,Product as described.,"I haven't seen a difference in using these for a month versus not using them at all, other than that my breath and skin smells a bit like garlic. But maybe that's just me."
5,What a great product!,"I've been getting the occasional cold sore or fever blister every since I`ve been a child. Like most people I've been looking for a product to control and eliminate breakouts without a prescription. I have found Super Lysine+ to be VERY effective. I started taking two pills a day when I first received it. After about a month I felt that tingle that indicates a sore is coming; I increased the dosage, taking three pills every few hours, along with using Abreva cold sore cream. The sore came but never got larger or irritating, and it was gone in about 48hrs. This is truly the best product I've found to beat cold sores, and I will continue to use it!"
2,Stinky,"I have taken Lysine before & have had no trouble. But, the odor from these were too much & I gave up and threw them out."
4,Super lysine,Delivered promptly. Pills are large but coated. Not difficult to swallow. There is a slight garlic smell/taste but nothing extreme or offensive.
5,"Let's Face It, this is so good.","Marlene,Lottye & Kurt,and Edith were what was going on in Europe at this time. This was what was going on here. The original recordings no less. Makes a great companion to Astaire Sings on Verve,both different styles, 50's jazz vs 30's pop. Something to treasure for a life time. The other Amazon review is unsurpassable,Anne Van Auken good job! There may trouble ahead, but as long as there's moonlight and love songs and romance, let's face the music and dance."
2,Too many errors to be truly useful,"I did not want to have to read the MSPress 240 exam book which weighs in at over 1300 pages. This book is about half the pages and given I hasve been using this product for almost 2 years now since Beta, I felt comfortable with the slimmed down version. However, this book has way too many errors to be useful. There is not enough detail about RIS or unattended installs. I have heard a good deal of the 240 exam is on this. It does not even tell the reader to register the RIS server in DHCP. The review questions are not always covered in the chapter so you do not know where to look for the correct answers. Great concept but unfortunatelely in the MCSE arena, 3rd party books are usually poor. It is back to MSPress for me. I cannot risk failing this test using this unedited text."
2,"The way the book is,,,","This book has very good informations that you need for the exam, ""BUT"", it is hard to understand. I've read many other books and this is the only one that I had to read it over and over to understand the info. If you don't have the time or in hurry to pass the exam, this isn't the book for u.Authur tries to describe 3 things in one sentence, which is hard to understand, it is not straight forward to the point like sybex does."
3,"Liked it, but...","Well, I read it thoroughly, and can tell you it's a good book in general. But there are things I can't put up with. For one, there are mistakes even in the answer sheet of the practice exam! Also, the acronyms explained in the text and figures conflict in various places (such as USN - Universal in the figure but Update in the text). The MSPress book wasn't ready when I got this one. Anyway, you can use their site for practice."
3,Not my first choice,"The book does have a LOT of information crammed into it's covers. BUT it was like reading an instruction manual. Not much better than a book from Microsoft. the ""real life"" scenarios at the end of each chapter were nice. The glossary, and index could use a lot of improvement. There were a LOT of new ideas and terminology introduced in Win 2000, the Glossary left a LOT of them out but still included definitions such as RAID. Terms an already certified MCSE would know. For the amount of information packed into it I was impressed but it's not one I'd put at the top of my list. I found several places where explanations were not very clear, or understandable or even where they used the word to define it's self. One of the sacrifices for packing a lot of info into on book. Over all it was a disappointment when I compared it to past books from this publisher."
2,Not so great !,"First of all, This book is suppose to prepare you for the 70-240 Windows 2000 exam.I fell that to many important material like DNS, AD, Ris are not covered in detail.Be carefull there is a lot of typo and mistake in this Exam Prep ! Use other references liky the Ressource Kit and other Core Exam Guide for a good preparation."
3,"Good book text, incorrect exam answers","The text of this book is pretty good, however, be VERY careful while taking the practice exams at the ends of the chapters. MANY of the answers are just flat out correct. You can use this knowledge to realize whether or not you know the text though, you should be able to identify the incorrect answers.I really like the ""real world projects"" at the ends of the chapter, a feature I have not seen before in one of these books."
1,Do NOT buy this book!,I purchased this reference plus the Exam Cram Core for Windows 2000. This reference is full of errors. Portions of the exam are correctly assembling lists. The exam does not fully function and has several errors and incorrect answers. I brought them to Exam Cram's attention in Feb. 2001. No updates have been issued nor replacements for the defective product. They have basically ignored the issues. I have swore off using any ExamCram products.
4,one of the book should buy,"This book contains lots good info for accelerated exam, but only missing few info that appeared on the exam I took. But it still helped me passed the exam. I think this is a good book to buy since it help me passed it :)"
2,"Errors, Errors, and More Errors","I was really disappointed to find some downright wrong information in the first couple of chapters, such as discrepancies between requirements for Windows 2000 (listed as 166 MHz in some places vs. 133 MHz in others), processors supported in Windows 2000 Server (the book says that 4 processors are supported for upgrades only, which is wrong), 1 GB free space (actual minimum is 685 MB), and dual-boot support (says you should use FAT or FAT 32 and that NTFS doesn't support it, which is flat wrong). And that's just chapters 1 and 2. Don't waste your money on such erroneous material!"
2,commercial for brain respiration,This book has a bit too much self-promotion for me. Over and over and over and over and over again the author claims that through his program 'Brain Respiration' one may become truly enlightened. His message is encouraging and I like that he says enlightenment is nothing if it doesn't help somebody else. However... this book is simply laced with too many references to his 'Brain Respiration'. If I wanted to read a book on Brain Respiration I would have bought it. Now I won't thanks to this author's rampant self-promotion. This book seems to be merely a lengthy advertisement.
2,not worth the price,"The writer says he is enlightened. Is he sane? I don't know. I don't want to ask him whether he is enlightened or not. Because when I ask so, he will answer me he is enlightened because he realized that there is nothing to ""realize."" So, I don't need another teacher who want me to surrender before him. Dalai-lama said ""spy on your spiritual teacher before you surrender yourself before him."" Dalai-lama himself never says he is enlightened. But we know lama himself is a very trustworthy teacher for humankind. Be careful, people. I'm from the same country where this writer came from."
2,What a downer,"Although I read the previous reviews which commented on the cushion's tendency to break down, I too, wanted to believe the best. I had tried the SBM-200 model in a store and loved it but when I heard the 300 version provided spot and width controls I thought that would be the better gift. Of the 7 times that the cushion was used since Christmas (two days), it was a hit. As my mother said, the best Christmas gift. But then the machine all of sudden had a mind of its own and shut down completely. It only allowed for the demo afterwards. When calling Homedics they said that this was highly unusual but based on the responses on this web-site I find that doubtful. Although my parents would like a replacement model, I don't think that would make the most sense, unfortunately. Until Homedics works out the kinks in this model I think we're going to stick with the SBM-200."
5,IT'S BETTER THAN THE QUAD 400!,"I JUST BOUGHT THE SBM300 AS WELL AS THE QUAD 400. THEY BOTH DO A GOOD JOB, AND THE 4 MASSAGE BALLS FEEL NICE IN THE QUAD, HOWEVER IT DOES NOT GO AS HIGH ON THE UPPER BACK AS THE SBM300! AND THE 400 IS SIGNIFICANTLY HEAVIER.SO IF UPPER BACK/SHOULDER MASSAGE IS NOT IMPORTANT TO YOU, THEN THE 400 MIGHT BE THE BETTER MNASSAGER FOR YOU BECAUSE OF THE QUAD ACTION - BUT A LOT OF MY TENSION IS IN MY VERY UPPER BACK, WHICH THE 400 DOES NOT REACH. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE SBM 300 (even though it runs a bit louder than the 400, but it's nothing too bad). JUST A SIDE NOTE - I AM 5 FT 2INCHES TALL -- EVEN THE SBM 300 WILL NOT LIKELY REACH THE UPPER SHOULDERS OF SOMEONE CLOSE TO 6 FEET TALL, AND THE 400 EVEN LESS SO.I HOPE THAT THIS HELPS!HAPPY SHOPPING :)"
1,"Works great if you only want a 60 sec ""demo""","Otherwise the unit is completely unresponsive after just one 20-minute use. I'd like to get another one because it seems like it could be a good product if it actually worked.And even worse we bought another one for a gift not yet given... Here's the gamble, is the gift defective? or is it one of the flukes that isn't? Based on the reviews, perhaps I should keep shopping."
1,Great while it lasted.....,"I took a chance on this item thinking that maybe the past reviewers just had bad luck. Well, I guess I can add my name to that list. This item worked great for about 3 days and then shut off by itself, (after 4 minutes of use), and would not turn back on. Fortunately, Amazon's return process is easy. Buyer beware....."
2,Good while it lasted,"We bought this item at Costco after trying out a floor model in the store. We liked it enough to buy it and brought it home this afternoon and set it up for use by family members that came over for dinner. Everyone that had an opportunity to try it (3 people) liked it. However, the device failed to work completely after being on for only about 30 minutes. The power light started to blink (which the manual indicates means the device is trying to turn off) and has not worked since. We tried letting it blink for 10-15 mintes, unplugged the unit from the power source (AC) for several hours and plugged it back in again, all to no avail. Turning to the homedic.com website provided no help whatsover as it only offered an online version of the owner manual. The unit will be retuned to the store this week for a refund. We only paid $100 but I expected the unit to work for more than 30 minutes."
1,Homedics SBM-300 Therapist Select,"Another defect the shiatsu selection not work, it rolls up and down like the rolling selection. returned for a lost of return shipping $20.00"
3,BACK MASSAGING UNIT,O.K. UNIT WORKS O.K. AFTER THE FIRST ON I GOT I TURNED IT ON IT SHORTED OUT FRIED THE RELAY IN IT .
1,TOTALLY DEFECTIVE PRODUCT!!,"I work as a Paramedic and as a result, tend to get back fatigue and general wear and tear of the muscles. I ordered a SBM-300 with high hopes for curing my back problems. When it arrived I removed it from the box, plugged it in and switched it on - a green LED light came on under the ""Power"" heading. The control unit gives several options for massage so I chose the ""Full Shiatsu"" mode. As soon as I pressed the button, the LED went off and there was a very strong burning smell coming from the power adapter. It has not worked since and the Homedics technical support have been very unhelpful - AVOID AT ALL COST!!!"
3,Needs to massage higher to reach neck!,"This is a good massager...it is really strong. I had tried one at a friends house, and it must have been a different model...because it felt great on my neck. So, I decided to order one for myself. I tried it the first day and it was a deep massage...I was pretty happy with it. In fact I was sore the next day after using it the first time. I have a terrible neck...and upper back...and I wish the machine reached my neck. I have tried to adjust the shiatsu ""balls"" to fit my small neck...but they must be made for a larger person. I cannot get it to fit to my neck...in fact I cannot even feel the massage on my neck. The rest of the massage is good...It feels great on my lower back. The rolling mechanism is good too...I just wish the neck part would work."
4,nice but does not fit any chair I own,best massage cusion I have owned but it does not fit any of my chairs...the price is very steep
4,Great product,"I have had this massage cushion for almost three months now and it has worked great. I like that it has a spot feature that allows you to focus on one area. The only negative thing about the product is that it probably fits best on an office-like chair. I've been using it with a straight-backed kitchen chair and I have to readjust myself a lot to make sure it hits the right spots. I think a chair with a little tilt to it would work best. Other than that, I am 100% satisfied with this product and I use it while I'm working on my computer- a great combo."
1,"Worked great, FOR 15 MINUTES!","I got this massager for my wife for Christmas. She tried it for 10 minutes on Christams day, then I tried it for about 5 minutes. It felt great. When we tried to use a couple of days later....nothing. It wouldn't even turn on. I am very suprised because Homedics had a good reputation. Now I have to pay to ship it back to Homedics, PLUS I have to pay a $10 fee for them to look at it even though it is brand new."
4,Just what I am looking for.,"I have had a spinal fusion between L4, L5, and S1. I am a larger fellow with thick back muscles. I am three months out from surgery and having great difficulty with the back muscles healing. Lots of spamisms and cramps. This massaging cushion is realitvly inexpensive and works out the kinks very well. After several weeks, spending 15 minutes on it after work, my muscles are much more relaxed. It is not a cureall or the overly fantastic. However, it works well, feels good and I am very satified with my purchase."
3,Was awesome while it lasted,"I bought four of these for myself and family members for Christmas. I absolutely loved it, but mine died yesterday. I had people over at my house who were using it and at the end of the day it would not power on. I thought someone had over-used it and not let it cool down, but it looks like tons of people have had the same problem so maybe it is a defective product. Luckily, mine was purchased from Costco so they took it back, but they do not have any more in San Diego. I would buy it again in a minute from Costco since they will take it back if there are problems. I was using it every day and my back felt great. It really is a wonderful massage chair, just needs to last."
4,"Love it, love it, love it!","The best thing about this massaging cushion is the ability to pause and hold the shiatsu massage in one place. Would be nice if it could reach a little higher and a little lower, but simply adjusting how I sit takes care of that. I don't use the seat bottom vibration and would prefer that the seat bottom be pliable to make it easier to adjust the back up/down for higher/lower back massaging. I am average build/height so the range works pretty good for me. For the money - a great buy!!"
3,Works ok but I don't use it as much I thought I would,"Tried it in the store and loved it. I have sore back and neck and thought this would help BUT after a couple of days of using it, I found that the rollers actually started making my back more sore in new places. I don't have regrets about buying it because I could spare the cash at the time. I think the biggest surprise I found was that you really can't set it up in a chair that you normally use because its too uncomfortable. I originally put it on my PC chair, which I do alot of gaming on, and it is quite uncomfortable to sit on. It now sits beside the chair on the floor and I only use it about once a month now. Quality wise it seems to be quite well built and works as described. If you buy it just remember to remove the screw in the back before you plug it in!"
4,Well satisfied but not excited,"I received the item in good condition and in a timely fashion. Functionality was as advertised. What feels like two hard balls moving under the cover of the devise provide the massage. One can lean against the devise as hard or as gently as one chooses to adjust the depth of the massage. I find that ten minutes or so on the shiatsu setting nicely relaxes the muscles in my back and shoulders. I find the alternative setting of little value. Since I have had the item for only three weeks, I have no estimate of its durability."
4,Well worth the money,"Although I'm not to thrilled with the roller massage, the Shiatsu massage feature is great. The only thing I wish it did was go up higher on the upper back. (I'm a 5'8"" female and I sit rather tall). If you're shorter, it'll perform better in this area. One feature that I love, and is worth paying the extra money over the SBM-200 model, is the ability to adjust the width of the rollers. Another feature I like is the ability to do a spot massage, where the rollers stay in one place (and that place is adjustable). Overall, a great product. It really makes your back feel good."
4,A nice Shiatsu cusion,"As a nurse, I have back problems from time to time and decided to try this cusion to see if it could help. I must say that with the many features the cusion offers, I was pleased. The only thing I would like to see improved is the distance the massager reaches. I'd like it to massage a little higher and a little lower. Maybe the next model."
1,another one bites the dust...,I bought this one for my wife at Sam's club. She loved it for the three sessions it worked. On the fourth try it would not power up - just like others have experienced. It's going back tomorrow for a refund. Too bad.
3,HoMedics SBM-300,"This wasn't as comfortable and relaxing as I had hoped, so I returned it. When placed in a chair, it was hard to get comfortable no matter the position."
1,Bad product description,"Hi, I recently purchased this item and was very disappointed with the product once it arrived. Product description doees not mention that what you are purchasing is a massager in a hard plastic shell that is very uncomfortable."
1,"Not all parts included, so...","...makes it difficult to tell how great or not-so-great this product is. It didn't come with the adapter for the outlet and Homedics doesn't make replacement ones, so they gave me some obnoxiously long specification list for finding one at, say, Radio Shack (at my expense, of course). Bummer to say the least. For the price, you'd think that Homedics would have that part covered for replacement. I got it for Christmas and it was a month or two before I even got around to trying it. Oh well, at least I'm not the one who paid for it....right??? :-("
5,Best Massage Ever,"I brought this item for my husband and tried it out for myself. It was the best massage that I ever had! It worked out all the tension in my back so good that I wanted to keep it for myself. Even though I bought it for my husband, we now are sharing it together. I recommend that everybody have one."
3,Just What I expected,"I didn't expect more form this inexpensive massaging cushion..I liked it for what it's worth...I will in the future buy the more expensive massaging chair from Sharper Image, which I tried and loved..."
5,Wonderful!!,This massaging cushion is the best!! I love it. The shiatsu massage really works your back deeply and it makes me thorougly relax. The up and down roller is delightful as well. I highly recommend this for anyone w/ back pain or who just likes to have their back massaged. I use mine everyday.
1,No Fluke,"I read ""Good while it lasted"" and should have listened, but I thought it was a fluke also. We had this item for only 4 days before it decided to stop working. Probably just the power supply, but returned item for refund...."
5,better than a therapist,I love the HoMedics SBM-300 the messaging action is VERY GOOD and I like that you can adjust the width of the rolling action. I have had the SM-200 model before and it was okay but the dual action on this is GREAT. Much cheaper than seeing a massage therapist several times a week.
4,"bought 2, 1 didn't work at all","I bought 2 of these cushions yesterday and surprisingly only one of those worked. I came upon this model a week ago and I liked it so much that I wanted to give it as a christmas gift. Shortly they were sold out virtually everywhere, but I managed to get them anyway. When I arrived at the store they had it on display, but I was a bit stumped because when I powered on the unit, it made a loud banging noise (I figured it was over used since it was on display). What do you know, one of my cushions did the exact same thing, remote wouldn't respond to anything, rollers won't go up or down. I'm exchanging it today and hopefully it will work as well.If you read all of these reviews to the very end, you will see tons of problems with this cushion's last year model (end of 2005-beginning of 2006). And not one though later in 2006. So hopefully mine was just a fluke and they fixed a serious glitch in it from 2005."
5,It's like having a daily visit from your massage therapist in your own home!,"i discovered this product waiting in a line at the pharmacy one day. love it. it saves me lots of money because instead of calling up my massage therapist i just sit on the massager. It's like having a daily visit from your massage therapist in your home!also - i have lower back pain at times/muscle strain and this baby really helps me stay limber/avoid throwing the back out AND it helps me get back to normal when i do. it works for me because i don't have a more serious issue requiring surgery or doctor's attention. and, most of the time, doctors just wanted to get me to take a pill, which didn't work for me.lastly, i find the massage helps with general relaxation! i'm in the computer chair most of the day and this is great for getting out the kinks!"
5,$$$ saver,"I bought this for my sister because she normally goes to the massage therapist at least once a week, figuring how expensive they are I purchased this as a birthday present. After the first month past it payed for itself."
5,Great Product-Really Works,This massaging cushion works exactly as the manufacturer's description says it will. It is helping loosen my back muscles and takes away the pain and stiffness. Glad I bought it.
2,More pain than pleasure,"I purchased this for my aging Father because he was having back pain issues. He tried it once, and he said it hurt quite a bit. I tried it myself, and he was right! No matter which setting I used, it seemed to poke my spine. It didn't really help my muscle tension, but rather made it worse. It is a shiatsu massager, but I thought it would be a deep muscle massage, not a poke in the spine and ribs. It's also heavy and cumbersome. It's in the closet waiting to go to the Thrift store."
2,Stopped working after about 100 uses,"I noticed that the top rated reviewer in this section reduced his review from 5 to 2 stars after the unit stopped working. I had the same experience. I had the unit about 2 years and without warning it just stopped functioning. I suspect it may be something wrong in the corded remote controller, but that remote is wired into the unit. Homedics should anticipate that electronics will sometimes stop functioning and allow you to detach the controller and get a new one. (Why not a simple external plug like many electronics units have?) I estimate I used the unit about 100 times (about once a week).As far as the massage goes, I go to a masseuse once a month and nothing can beat the human touch. I also found that it did not help with a sore back -- the roller mechanism is just too hard and inflexible. It did provide relief from tension in the back."
2,"""The back massager that burns twice as bright burns half as long ...","... and you have burned so very, very brightly, SBM-300.""Sadly, I agree with all three of the previous reviewers. This massager is the best I've tried, but mine stopped powering up after three uses. Five stars for the massage + One star for the 40 minute lifetime = Don't lose that receipt!"
1,Total JUNK!!!,I got this for Christmas and got the exact same results as everyone else. Only worked for 15-20 minutes then refused to turn on for days. Came home this evening to use it for only the 3rd time - wont turn on at all. Tried everything to no avail. Save your money and avoid this piece of junk!!!
1,Good when it's worked...for two weeks.,"I loved it. Left my back feeling good. But within two weeks, the massage heads started stuttering in the lower region - still working, but making a sort of slipping noise, as if the gears were missing their purchase. Then, it just stopped. The lights on the control blinked, but the machine was dead. Would've been nice to have spent this much money on something that worked. Not well made."
1,Wish I knew,Hard to say whether I liked this massager or not considering it won't power up at all. Guess I should have paid more attention to the other reviewers. There is definately a problem with this unit.I think I'll give the SBM-200 a try.....it seems to have a better track record.
2,chinese torture devise,"I bought two of these cushions for my elderly parents who have back discomforts. They were reluctant to tell me how they like them, but eventually admitted that they were pretty brutal and uncomfortable. They asked if I would mind if they sent one back. They also said they were quite unattractive."
1,Works great ... then stops working,"This was great, while it lasted. It worked for a month, then suddenly stopped and cannot get it back to work. Unfortunately, I bought this at Walmart, and they treat you as if you had stolen the item and would not let me exchange, nor return this defective product. I would say not to buy it; just looking at the other reviews, it has the same feature: stops working suddenly!"
4,good for the money,Pretty good product for the money; No complaints aside from that it could be little higher to get at the neck area. Works well!
5,Homedics Therapist Select Shistu + Massager,"I bought this because I have Fibromyalgia which gives me pain all over my body at times and my husband has low back problems. This has a massager that just about covers the entire body when you place it in a chair. We use a reclining chair. Then the Shistu kind of rolls up and down your back and legs. It feels wonderful. It really doesn't take my Fibro pain away, but at least I feel good while I'm using it. And it does help my husband's low back pain. I love all the Homedic products!"
5,Almost like the real thing......,"I love this cushion.....I have had it for 6 weeks and think it is terrific. I have alot of back problems and tight muscles, and this cushion is the next best thing to a deep tissue massage for someone who can not make a regular visit to their massage therapist(and I AM a massage therapist, so I speak from experience!). The fact that you can concentrate on a tight spot is great and vary the width of the rollers is smart....I only wish it would go up higher on the back, to the neck(maybe if you are shorter, it does). But all and all, it is a worthwhile purchase for use in between your massage therapy appointments!"
1,Broke after 2 days of regular use,"It was great... for 2 days. The third day, I sat on it and the rolling action wouldn't work. The rotating things remain fixed at the bottom and won't move up!"
5,Husband LOVES this cushion !!,"I purchased this for my husband for Christmas. He is a warehouseman,and does a lot of lifting on a daily basis.He has a achy back on a daily basis too. When he opened this gift at Christmas he was rather skeptical. Then he tried it...and fell in love with it.He now uses it several times a week just before bed time.He sleeps like a baby, and his achy back does not wake him up during the night.Thanks HoMedics and Amazon !!"
4,SBM-300 MASSAGER,"I may have given it a 5 but I don't have much to compare it to. Its much better than the kind that just roll up and down because it kneads too, approximating a person better. For what it is, its great. a little loud, but all in all, feels/works great. Hope this helps."
1,Failed after 9 months,I bought this after going to the junkyard & pulling an idle speed control & it not working right. This unit began to stick & not allow a proper idle after 9 months. A year after purchase it was completely dead. Out of desperation I took this unit apart & discovered it is a cheap aftermarket. It is NOT AC delco. After taking apart my original ISC I could tell a difference between the OEM & this. The OEM is three times as heavy & the plastic gears inside alot more sturdy. Once I had them both apart I discovered hard greasy crud in the original. I cleaned & lubed the original & it works like a charm. So $101 spent on this & its garbage. I might as well went to the strip club with that money!Also the bracket was bent 90 degrees from where I needed it & they failed to drill out one of the mounting holes!
4,A New Addition to My Favorites List,I have recently discovered this work and how delighted I am that I did! This music is very appealing. How could it not stir ones very soul? I think this is the third rendition I have heard and the quality of interpretation and performance is superb. The soloists are outstanding. Only the quality of the recording is somewhat lacking.
4,Refreshing and entertaining,"Toure's mixed bag of short stories is nothing short of entertaining, sometimes funny and refreshingly UN-PC. His words jump at you and in your mind's eye, you can see the story as plainly as you would if you went to the movie theatre. Not every author has that talent, and this reader is holding her breath waiting for the next Toure publication. Worth every penny."
4,Great writing...!,"Through the short stories that Touré serves to avid readers, you are able to escape to a place where only African Americans exist. In all their glory and short comings, Touré walks you through the lives of those who reside in the exciting Soul City. Great writing, sir! -LC"
1,One of the worst books that I have read.,"The best thing about this book is the title and the cover illustration. Toure is ANOTHER African-American writer who seems ill at ease with being an African-American; so he delves in the enormous bucket of Black Cultural Stereotypes to people his lackluster stories, all in the name of being hip. From fried chicken to [lusty] preachers to athletics, there is no Black cliche beneath Toure and his word processor. The entire book read as if it were written by a really dorky guy looking at a cool party through a window. He wasn't that good when he wrote for Rolling Stone, and he is even worse here. Whomever decided to give him his book deal needs to recoup their advance and have him try again."
2,just there,while Toure has some interesting ideas I find His writing style too be very boring&just kinda there.I think He is a Very Overrated Writer.He was kinda Lame at Rolling Stone&now with a Book which while being cleaver at times basically just says the same thing over&over.
2,Disapointing,"I read the first two stories in the bookstore ""Steviewondermobile"" and the second one about the Chruch of Kentucky Fried Souls and I thought they were fun and hilarious and refreshingly colorful. So I bought the book but the rest of them were no where near as good and many times bordered on boring. I wanted to like this book because I was laughing so hard at the Kentucky Fried Souls, but it was like he repeated the same ideas over and over again in increasingly less interesting ways. THis book did however sell out in my bookstore and I think its because the cover art is as entertaining as the Kentucky Fried Souls story. Is that story, however funny or colorful, worth the price of the book? Not really."
2,I think the sequel will be better...,"Now I'm not really a fan of magic realism. In fact, every other book I've tried to read in the genre I've never finished. This collection was actually not so bad. The stories take place in Soul City, a urban black utopia of sorts. Some of the stories left me a bit bored, but others were good. I got the chance to meet Toure and he read some of the stories that will be in his next book which centers around more residents of Soul City. I'll be sure to pick it up because it seems like he is only maturing as a writer."
5,Jeremy Brett IS Holmes!,"This complete series is magnificent! The pricing was great as well. Once again, Amazon has come threw . I was nicely surprised at the way the DVD's were packaged. There were several boxed set to choose from and I think I picked the right one, I highly recommend this set!"
5,Sherlock Holmes: The Complete Granada TV Series 12 DVD,"The Granada Series is the clearest and sharpest video that we have seen on our HD DVD player and HD LCD television!! The picture is almost 3-D and the sound is wonderful. If you want Sherlock Holmes to come into your room with you, then this set is for you. Only a ""live performance"" would be better then this set. FANTASTIC!!"
5,Definitive Holmes,"Beautifully reconstructed. First class attention to detail and the period.Excellent performances by the entire cast especially Brett.I watched the entire series telecast in India in the '80's and '90's and am indeed have been recently watching the episodes again on History Channel.Ive also collected each and every one of this series on DVD via ebay. First class quality.Well worth the expenditure to add to your home dvd collection if you are a ""holmes-ian"" or Sherlock Fan. Highly recommended, in my opinion.Except for a few episodes - Last Vampyre, Eligible Bachelor etc, every other episode was brilliant. These two mentioned above, were slightly implausible and only based on Conan Doyle's work - not very good adaptations because too much license was granted to the directors/ screenplay.Otherwise, a ""simply Must Have!"""
5,Probably the Best SH series you can own,"The DVD set is of amazing quality, even in a High-Def TV.You get everything that was released in this series, including the movies and TV series. Worth every penny. If you like Sherlock Holmes, this is probably the best series you can own."
1,This description of this product is misleading.,"This DVD set was supposed to be a complete collection of the Granada's Sherlock Holmes series, in 12 DVDs. I received only 6 DVDs, under a box that labeled ""Volume 1"". Supposedly there's volume 2 somewhere that is not available on this site. For those who want the entire collection from this purchase, you should be advised that the description for this product is misleading. It comes with only 6 DVDs, and NOT the complete collection of the series. I would have given it a minus star for the hassle this purchase brought me, in calling customer service all the way from Thailand, and in the effort to pack and return the merchandise. Really not a good experience. It would have been so much easier if they would just give you the correct description."
5,Simply THE Best,"There's nothing much to say. This is simply and definitely the best Holmes ever. Brett is out of sight!I can't say much about this specific box, since I purchased the European edition by Koch Media years ago (3 boxes).Absolutely a have-to-have!"
5,Brett is the definitive Holmes,"There are certain actors when they bring a character to life, bring the character as written to life. David Suchet is Poirot, Patrick Tull the definitive reader of the Aubrey/Maturin series by O'brian and Jeremy Brett is the definitive Sherlock Holmes as written by Doyle. The others are cartoons beside his portrayal. For anyone who is already a Holmes fan or for someone who is wondering what all the hullabaloo is about, this is the dvd set for you. There are reasons classics are classics as written and Brett will show you why Holmes fascinates after all the years he has been before the public. Enjoy."
2,Beware: these are not accurate transfers.,"There is a major problem with DVD's like these,the original Granada tapes were mastered and shot in England in the PAL format for English tv- which runs at 25 frames-per-second. BUT this box has been slowed down to the NTSC format of 24 frames-per-second and thus it is an inaccurate representation of Jeremy Brett's frenetic performance. Basically an extra minute is added every 24 minutes.I ordered my complete set from Amazon.co.uk in the original 25fps PAL format. Why have remastered picture and sound at the wrong speed??"
3,Later episodes disappointing,"The quality of the recordings is excellent. We enjoyed the early episodes, when Jeremy Brett was healthier. In the later episodes, it is clear he is not well and to compensate, he seems to be overacting."
2,set arrived with disc problems,"The item Sherlock Holmes: The Complete Granada Television Series (12 DVD) (Purchased on 11/06/2009)was received and upon playing the discs, I found that one disc was impossible to read and would not play at all and, another had problems with search mode and transitioning to the next episode. I complained to Amazon and they refunded a partial payment. The item should have been pre-tested to avoid such problems."
1,Sherlock Holmes : The Complete Granada Television Series,"Not only is this the complete series,but it comes with a small booklet filled with information about each episode, the cast and behind the scenes ""factoids"". No other series of Sherlock Holmes mysteries has such consistency of the characters. Not to mention, Dr. Watson is at last portrayed as Conan Doyle intended. Each episode stands alone, but viewing them sequentially adds yet another dimension."
1,Worst Sherlock Holmes Ever,"If you have read A.C. Doyle's Holmes, there is no way you should like J. Brett as Holmes. He is just awful.....the epitome of 80's acting (and that's not a compliment). But don't think he is the only shortcoming of this series.Ronald Howard...Basil Rathbone....actors who portrayed Holmes well. Do yourself a favor and forget the Granada Series was ever made."
4,Sherlock Holmes Mysteries,"As a Sherlock Holmes buff, I find Jeremy Brett's portrayal of him to be absolutely the best. The stories in this DVD collection are faithful to the Sherlock Holmes genre and beautifully photographed."
4,The definitive Holmes!,"I watched this series when it began in the 1980s. Our PBS station plays some of the episodes occasionally, but I wanted to see all of them again. They look brand-new to me. Would highly recommend them."
5,Spectacular Picture Quality,"Terrific extras...interviews with Edward Hardwicke, Jeremy Brett, and the son of A. Conan Doyle. Picture quality is exceptional. This is clearly the best production of the Holmes saga."
5,Wonderful,"I grew up watching this incarnation of Sherlock Holmes on PBS ""Mystery"". When I had the chance to buy the entire collection on DVD I did not hesitate. The transfer to DVD is very good, but it does have it's rough spots. The collection is complete and includes a nice ""book"" with some very interseting information regarding the episodes and actors. There are some nice special features which include interviews and are worth the time to watch. I highly recommend to anyone who loves Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes as I do, you must have this collection."
4,Wish I had bought 2 sets because the price jumped.,"This set turned out to be everything the good reviews promised it to be. My only regret is that I only bought one set. I want to give one as a gift, but see that the price has increased by 30% since I bought my set only 2 months ago. I am not sure I want to spend 30% more for the same item.Update: Just one day after I posted the original note, the price dropped to below what I paid for my first set. I ordered my second set immediately. What a bargain."
5,Let me join the chorus: Brett is the best Holmes ever and the Granada series is great!,"I'll keep it short: No one has ever captured Holmes as well as Jeremy Brett and no Holmes productions have been as true to the character- his gifts and his demons- as the Granada series. I own very few DVD collections of TV shows, but I wouldn't part with this one."
4,IS THERE SUB TITLES?,"I purchased this series from another place and it was horrible. no disc matched the number on the disc. one was really eight, five was one, etc. no subtitles at all and no way to select anything from the menu. I needed subtitles for hearing impaired. any feedback would be great so I know whether to purchase this set."
3,Expected Better Quality,"Haven't looked at all discs yet but on disk 1 several brief periods of digital noise while viewing. The plastic holder for disc 6,9 and 12 have cracks at the top. Otherwise the rest of the collection is in pretty good shape. Will update as I view other discs"
1,Really? Broken? For real?,"First of all, the butter dish is gorgeous. The bottom plate is a bit larger and more square than I expected but whatever. Warning: This is about to be one of those annoying low rating reviews that has nothing to do with the product but everything to do with the packaging. OH MY GOD, after the other reviews here that announced the broken condition of the product, this company STILL sends poorly packaged merchandise?! Are you kidding me? Was it so foolish of me to take the chance that they could be bothered to read all of four reviews and see that their packaging is horrible? *Sigh.* Sadly, the answer to that question is ""Yes."" So, the plate was broken cleanly in two pieces, diagonally from one corner clear to the other one. I'm returning the butterdish. Buh bye. Have a nicer trip home than you did getting here. Honestly. This can't be good for business."
1,another broken item,Unbelievable! Another broken item. Please replace immediately. My mother is elderly and should not be expected to return it. It is so beautiful...too bad it was received in pieces.
3,BROKEN AND MORE BROKEN,"This is not a criticism of the dish itself, which is great. We were buying another to replace one broken by our kids. We ordered it and it was shipped by placing the dish, in its native cardboard box, in the corner of a slightly larger Amazon cardboard box, with two air filled pouches along the two exposed sides as the only buffer. Of course, it arrived smashed.We did an RMA and the replacement came packed in the same way and even more smashed.We requested another RMA, but now Amazon says they are out of the product.Even during the Holidays, it shouldn't be hard to get good help in this economic climate."
2,Good product Lousy Packaging,"The dish looked beautiful, unfortunately they don't know how to package it. Received with several pieces broken off. The return process was great but I shouldn't had to return it if it was packaged right the first time."
1,"Arrived broken, poorly packed","I love these items, but I ordered this and the sugar bowl and both arrived broken. What a disappointment, not to mention a waste of time. I hope Amazon has improved its packing since then..."
3,Edward de Levie,"This book is not for the faint at heart. This would be the ultimate guide to Robet's Rules, however, it is not designed for use by the casual user. Don't expect to use it as a quick reference for the average person that has general knowledge and limited experience.The physical properties of the book make it difficult to handle as it is small and quite thick and the print is quite small. In all likelyhood, the binding will give out quickly with moderate use.While all the information is there you would have to be an expert to utilize it properly. Save this for a true Parliamentarian or a student studying Parliamentary procedure."
4,The Bible of Parliamentary Procedure,"An excellent reference book, but not designed as a tutorial. If you want to look up parliamentary procedure, RONR is the place. If you want to study it, keep this book by your side, but read something else."
4,Comfy and Stylish,"The sandal is very comfortable. The toe part is a little too wide but it is still wearable. However, the first day the front chipped off on the side walk. Wore it for about 12 hours and my feet did not complain."
4,A Great Treat,It's always a treat to read a new Gifune novel. The writing flowed freely and easily. I wished it could've been longer.
4,Blast from the past!,"I love the classic NES series! Here we have the only Legend of Zelda game that is side scrolling. This is very reminiscent of games like Metroid and Castlevania 2. Some have expressed their dislike for this particular chapter in the Legend of Zelda saga, but I think they are insane! This adventure is definitely worth embarking on."
5,zelda,i loved these games and i have found out that these last a lot longer and work better than the old nes games. i love the classics and they look just the same the only thing is its on a smaller screen that is the only problem in my opinion
5,For a non Zelda fan a breathe of fresh air,I must admit I own 3 Nintendo systems and never got big into the Zelda Franchise. This game I enjoy for two reasons one it's basically a port of the original no graphic upgrades and such. Secondly I enjoy the fact that it plays way different than your standard Zelda game. Maybe I'll give this one a chance.
4,Oldie but a Goodie,My wife bought it for my birthday as I have always been a Zelda fan. I play it on my Nintendo DS and it's still as fun as it was on the SuperNES.
5,Collectors dream,Another great game to add to my collection. Anybody that loves Nintendo or the Zelda series would be smart to pick this one up.
2,what?,I am a big Zelda fan and this game was different from other Zelda games like it was a sidescroling rpg type game. That idea could acctully have made this a great game but the thing I realy hated is that this game is like the hardest game ever. If you die three times your done for. Also the enimies are way too hard. Being able to use magic was preaty cool though and unlike the first zelda game you can see people walk through the towns instead of standing in one spot which was preaty facinating back than. I wouldnt recomend buying this game but if you do see it for like a dollar or two than go check it out. I think every Zelda game is worth trying out even this one.
2,not as fun as other Zeldas,"I had emailed this company to cancel my order when I realized I had ordered the wrong Zelda, but they never responded to me, even after 3 or 4 emails.This game is boring and not as much as fun as the other Zelda games"
5,A classic sequel gets shrunken down for GBA,"Zelda II: The Adventure of Link is the sequel to one of the best games ever made for the NES. It was released in 1987 for the NES and was the first Zelda game to cause quite a stir as it was revered and loathed at the same time. But I won't get into the huge debate that still rages on to this very day and focus on this port. It was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2004 under the ""Classic NES Series"" banner.This is an excellent port of the classic NES sequel to The Legend of Zelda. It is perfectly emulated for the Game Boy Advance and with the button layout, Zelda II is great to take with you wherever you wind up. Though you could find the original NES cartridge, you can settle for tracking down the GBA cart instead and it probably won't cost as much. I loved this game and have the original NES cartridge so if you don't have this game yet, do not wait any longer! *****HIGHLY RECOMMENDED****"
1,This game is not for Zelda fans,"If you liked The Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening and you want more of the same, do not buy this game. I've had it for one day and I am trading it in. It is nothing like the other Zelda games; the graphics are different and it is side scrolling instead of overhead view. There are no clues. I didn't get past the first level - and I didn't want to continue. It is not fun or interesting. I felt like I was playing something like Ms. Pac Man."
2,MEH......,"This book is too punny. I think that if this book read more like the ""Zombie Survival Guide"", it would be much, much better."
2,Average at best,"I bought this book along with the Zombie Survival guide based on the reader recommendations here as I wanted something a bit out of the ordinary to read. I'd have to say this is by far the worse of the 2.Unlike the Zombie Survival Guide, which actually reads like a real factual book, this one is just lacking. I realise its a parody book, but there wasn't a huge amount of detail or humor involved. Maybe it's aimed at a younger age group or possibly someone with a minimal knowledge of super heroes and comics, I don't know, but as an adult who was an avid comic book reader in my younger years it failed to make the grade. It just didn't quite capture me, I read it on and off over a couple of weeks and don't feel the urge to read the last few chapters.Maybe if it was sanctioned by Marvel or DC comics giving it more liscence to refer to more specific characters it would have been a better nostalgia peice, in its current form it reads like a weak joke stretched way too far."
3,Good Book,"This book is pretty good. It can get a bit wordy, but it doesn't detract that much from it's overall purpose."
2,Disappointed,"I was kinda disappointed with this manual. I had great expectations after reading the Zombie Survival Guide by Max Brooks, and was hoping for more of the same, but this book was a joke. There was very little substance to the book, and was very much designed only to be a gag. I received no helpful advice whatsoever on becoming a superhero."
2,not recomended,"This book has been done better elsewhere. The illustrations were possibly the best bits - but then only if you are a fan of the art style used in games such as Fallout.If you are into ""How To"" parody books, readThe Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection from the Living DeadorHow to Be a Villain: Evil Laughs, Secret Lairs, Master Plans, and More!!!instead."
1,Don't waste your money,This book tries to be funny but does not quite succeed. If this book was a superhero it would be the INCREDIBLE LETDOWN.
2,Meh.,"Mildly clever, by-the-numbers satire of a fairly easy genre to mock. I'd recommend flipping through the table of contents and reading the first 5 pages; you'll get the idea and have no need to read further."
2,Loves Old Sweet Song Leaves a Bitter Taste,While the performances on this CD are great the transfers from the original recordings are about the worst i have ever heard. No care whatever was spent in dubbing these records to Cd. The originals in my collection sound many times better than these. I bought this for convenience but find it too terrible to listen
3,Colditz on Blu ray disc,"This review will focus on the quality of the Blu ray disc, since the plot and performances were reviewed by everyone else. The image quality is equal (perhaps slightly above) to an upscaled DVD. Do not expect the crisp image of a recent big screen movie, you will be disappointed. The colors may be a bit more intense than a DVD, but the sharpness leaves a lot to be desired. Obviously this is a made-for-tv miniseries, but still. There are no extras whatsoever, no chapters, not even a trailer or subtitles (which makes Damian Lewis' character a bit hard to understand at times, since he speaks with a heavy Irish accent). In conclusion, this is a decent movie on a poor Blu ray disc. For under $10 though, it's worth a buy if you like WWII/prison dramas."
2,2.5,"Not that good. The acting was good with a host of stars in the early part of their career, but the storyline of repeated escape attempts was kind of silly. Basically, the prisoners were given ample room to walk around the castle, do what they want, and attempt to escape. The only punishment to scare them from trying was a month in the hole. Was this a real story? I find it hard to believe a prison designed specifically for the ""best escape artists"" would give their prisoners so much freedom. SPOILER: If you do watch this movie, the ending is pretty good. Not a happy one, but good none the less."
3,Loose Drama on the Real Ife Events at Colditz,The drama presented generally follows the real life events of Colditz but the intrigue centers more on the fictional interaction between the fictional characters than the actual events. Entertaining but not ranked high in historical content.
3,Colditz Review,"Compared to other movies on similar topics, I think this one falls short. Mainly, it is dull, with a few moments of interest. None of the acting is stellar, except for maybe the artist. He isn't in it much though. I did give it three stars for the above mentioned interesting moments. However, I judge a film based on its ability to draw me in, and I didn't get drawn in."
5,Cloditz,If you like true WW11 stories then you have to get this one for your collection. Beautifully filmed with an excellent cast. 10 toes up
1,Not what I expected,"As an amature student of WWII prison stories the title of this movie led me to believe it would follow the book. I thought it might take some liberty, as did ""The Great Escape"", but this turned out to be a human-interest story. While it wasn't bad, it was not at all within my range of interest. Anyone want to buy it cheap?"
4,prison camp,OH this is a heavy flick. about the prison camp during WWII and the guys in it.Its well acted but takes a strong stomach to watch it. not for just any one or the faint at heart.
2,I DON'T EVEN RECALL ORDERING,I WILL ADD IT TO MY LIBRARY OF DVDs AND IT WILL BE AVAILABLE IF I CHOOSE TO USE IT.
3,brentlydroberts,The movie was pretty good how ever I though that it was going to be historically accurate. However it was still a good movie and I would recommended it because the movie did show what life was like in the infamous Colditz Prison.
3,Colditz:,"This movie was very interesting about world war 2 and prisoners of war it had profanity, which actually takes away from the movie"
3,Colditz: The Complete 2-Part Miniseries,I enjoyed it but was a little disappointed with the actors chosen to play the parts and the story line of the series. I would recommend it be rented or watched on rental web site before buying.
2,Wishful Thinking,"The content of this story is a good mystery and a totally unheard of way of life, but the author left me feeling as if this were a sexual, imagined event fulfilling a wish, the author's own fantasy. I think I learned more about the author than just enjoying a good read. Sounds as if this author is a picture perfect, exaggeration of self and probably comes straight from the author's own wishful thinking. Jax Laffer, Silke Saybrook, Joe Green, Felicia...give me a break! Sounds as if this author's training came straight from Soap Opera Central!"
4,Brittannia rules the waves,"This is just a beautiful book and if you are a British reader, by all means go out and buy yourself one of those cheap used copies floating around. American readers, however, may find it upon close reading rather less helpful because Royal Yachting Association instructor Jeffery has written a book closely tailored for his British audience. Americans and Britons may sail the same seas but the endless difference in detail of how things are done (mooring between posts, mooring in rafts, ""drying out"") and how they are said (the term ""warp"" seemingly used in five different ways and I could only gather two from context) make British sailing seem like almost a different sport. An experienced American sailor will, however, find some good food for thought in discussions of method and there are numerous color photographs of small, sleek, well-crafted British sailboats that aren't sold in North America, to our dismay!"
5,Instantly useful,"This book got me into doing very cool work with Elements within minutes of opening its cover. I'm a big fan of this visual series, which features a step-by-step illustrated approach head-and-shoulders above the typical documentation, and this was a huge help in my small business and personal photography. If you want to save precious time while creating expert-looking photos, get this book!"
3,Blue Hawaii - Various Artists,"If you are looking for an album of Hawaiian music where you have a good selection of artists, this Blue Hawaii album (Various Artists) is the one to buy! One of my favorites is Blue Hawaii #4 and also Sweet Leilani #5. The album is worth the price just for those two songs. The variety of other artists also make this album one you will want in your collection. Just listening to the various selections will make you feel like you are on the beautiful islands of Hawaii."
1,If only there was an option for zero stars...,"As someone who considers herself reasonably well-read and well-traveled, this book is an insult to travel guides. As a woman, this book was also offensive due to the authors advocacy of hooking up with a guy while traveling, then using him to leach free lodging, meals and entertainment. There is also a theme of alcohol use as an excuse for her poor decision-making.If you enjoy stories about vacation romances, this book may be appealing. But if you are seeking a resource as a woman traveling alone, please don't waste your money or indeed the 2 hours needed to breeze through it."
2,abdullah yusuf ali trans,I read a the Abdullah Yusuf Ali translation at my local mosque and thought it was very good so I ordered it from Amazon. It arrived today and I must say it wasn't exactly what I expected. The pages are VERY thin and can rip easily and the text size is just too small.
1,Qur'an text translation,"the information in this book is the key to happiness and prosperity in this world and the world after.But the paper in wich this book is printed on ,is tissue paper,in wich the text from the following page<s> is very evident and makes trying to read the holy book very very difficult.not recommended to be purchased . A better printed copy is available elsewere."
3,"Great translation, lousy print - recommend amana print","The Yusuf Ali translation of the Qur'an has long been considered among the most precise and eloquent renderings of the holy book of Muslims into English. However, I would recommend purchasing the amana publications version of this work, due to its superior print quality and binding. amazon.com thankfully now sells it, its ISBN is 0915957760 . The Meaning of the Holy Qur'an Abdullah Yusuf Ali."
1,Quran,"Difficult to read, the paper is so thin I get a lot of bleed through from the opposite side of the page. I have tried placing a dark sheet of blank paper underneath the page. It was of no use as was a white sheet used in the same manner. This caused a lot of eye strain. I will purchase another but at a book store so I can see the paper quality prior to spending my money. I would suggest that tracing paper not be used in the future."
2,extremely thin paper,the Qur'an is perfect with the translation just one thing the paper is extremely thin. i just think the pages should be just like a regular book strong not more or less
2,Not a clear translation,"The author does an admirable job in his translation. However, in the effort to covey Arabic words in English, he uses words that make the reading unusually difficult to follow. Unlike the translation by Rashad Khalifa that flows very well and remains true to the original essence of meaning, this author loses the reader."
5,"To Understand Islam, One Must Read the Qur'an","This is a beautiful book, containing the full text of the Qur'an, in Arabic, a full translation in English, as well as commentary in English.I purchased this translation of the Qur'an, that I might read ""The Truth About Muhammad"" by Robert Spencer, with greater facility. According to Spencer, ""Qu'ranic verse numeration is not standard."" To be able to lookup the verses mentioned by Spencer, one must have a copy of one the translations which he used as a reference. This translation of the Qur'an is one referenced by Spencer."
5,Gives a person an understanding.,"I brought this book for the purpose of finding out about the Islamic faith. What I have read so far is an eye-opener (and I'm not talking about having to read the book backwards!). Hearing fundamentalists calling non-Islamists ""Infidel"" (non-believer) on TV many times, challenges what the Quran actually says. The Prophet Mohammed states clearly that Allah is the same God as whom Christians and Jews pray to, so that tells me that Islamic Militants don't know what they are talking about when they call a Christian or a Jew an Infidel. The Quran tells me that the faiths have a lot more in common than what some persons would like us to believe. While I don't intend to abandon my Christian faith, reading the Quran will make me rather more tolerant of those Muslums who don't espouse violence."
2,Quality of paper is very poor,"No issue with the translation or commentary, they are probably the best in class. The issue is with the paper quality, it is extremely low! I'm disappointed to see people using such low standard materials for books, as important as Quran! Note, these kind of Books are supposed to stay/used on long term basis, so there should be a minimum standard of quality!My advise to publisher (Tahrike Tarsile Qur'an) is to charge more price but for the sake of God don't sacrifice quality, not for Holy Books like Quran, at least!!"
5,Divine Words in Human Language,"Very comprehensive and clear manual to operate in this world. Excellent source to understand the purpose of life. These are the true words of God revealing the code and way of life to make life easier and purposeful. Commentary is very helpful to understand the literal translation. Language is simple and beautiful. Summing up, this is the most useful book I've ever read and it is imperative to read this book for anyone who is trying to find the purpose of this life."
4,One of the Foremost English Translations,"The translation by Abdulla Yusuf Ali is printed by several publishers. A much better printing is by Amana Publications ISBN 1590080254 (hardcover)entitled ""The Meaning of the Holy Qur'an"" with a soft cover and pocket edition also available. It contains the same translation and notes but has been updated more recently than the Tahrike version. The Amana edition is printed with the pages turning left to right, as an English reader is used to, rather than right to left as in the Tahrike publisher version. Also, the print is much easier to read, it is printed on acid free paper and leather(ette) bound. Overall the Amana edition is much finer for virtually the same price."
5,Get a better Understanding,If a person wants to get a etter understanding of Quran then this is the best translation of the meaning of Quran. Ihaveother copies bu this copy gives a much better understanding.
5,A find!,"This book was given to my granddaughter when she was dedicated as a baby. After opening it at the family brunch after church, my daughter started to read it aloud to the gathered family. Gradually, we all leaned forward, listening intently, because it's simple enough for a child, but the universal truth about prayer was for all of us. A blessing.I would wish every family could have this book on the shelf with the Bible, the dictionary, and the atlas."
3,Perfume of Egypt,"For the layman this book contains stories with a supernatural slant but for someone with some occult training the events related in this book are interesting ""case"" studies. The book seems to have been written for the general public is easy to read.Minor explanations are given by the writer at the end of each story.Overall a nice book by a highly skilled occultist whose other publications are much more complex and insightful."
2,Just don't buy it in white!,We tried this sink in black at home from Lowe's but it's actually more anthracite than black and didn't match our granite topped so settled on white which matches our tile counters. Unfortunately the white stains VERY easily and is very difficult to keep clean. We're planning on returning it as soon as we can find a good alternative.
5,Love it!,I am very impressed with my new granite sink. It is everything I had hoped for. I received shipment much earlier than I thought and I am very impressed with the company I purchased it from.
4,High quality geopolitcal military history,"The Norman invasion of England has always fascinated me, as it has a great many English-speaking historians. Gravett is a military historian/wargamer, so his approach is very detailed. You can follow the invasion, from the geopolitical rationale behind it to its preparation and the landing at Pevensey, almost day by day, mile by mile. And the culminating battle -- a pretty close thing, actually -- minute by minute and yard by yard. The strategic and tactical maps are excellent and there are also a number of plates displaying typical arms and armor on both sides."
3,"Weak on context of campaign, comparisons of opponents","This book does a fairly good job at describing the battles that eventually led to Hastings and the actual battle itself but, unfortunately, if falls weak on providing a context of why the war itself occurred. Most Osprey Campaign series books provide a few pages providing a geopolitical context regarding, the causes of the campaign's the cover and the nations/forces involved. Unfortunatley this one does a poor job hence the reader does not really know (at least based on reading the book) as to why the campaign was fought and what the opposing side's goals were. In addition, although there is fairly decent discussion regarding the commanders on both sides, there is little discussion comparing the opposing sides armies. What was lower and middle officer quality like? What about troop quality? Were there differences in tactics? These, among other questions, are simply unanswered. These are gaps that should not have been left open."
5,Excellent Product and Delivery,"This tambourine, was just as I expected. I was very impressed with how quickly it was delivered to me."
1,Made In China Vs Made In The U.S.A.,"I've been using the Rhythm Tech RT Tambourine with nickel jingles for a while and I loved it. I decided to purchase another one. I was shocked the first time I used the new one. It sounded awful, like a cheap toy. I compared the two tambourines to see if I could figure out what was wrong. Same shape, both nickel jingles, the only difference is the new awful sounding one was labeled made in China. So there ya go!"
4,"Excellent, Crisp Jingle!","Rhythm Tech makes good, durable tambourines. They have become maybe a bit pricey, but I'm a tightwad! Ha ha ha!"
5,"A thought-provoking, thoughtful & educated look","A thought-provoking, thoughtful & educated look at brain influences on behavior.Welch's experience in neuropsychology and theology make this book useful to one interested in the challenge of making sense of recent research on brain influences. His easy to read and personal style make what could be ponderous and stuffy into an enjoyable, challenging experience."
3,Good belt for the price,"ProsGood sturdy belt.The buckle is very well made and has really good welds on it.Good Price.ConsLeather only under one side of the buckle, unlike others I have used.Clip ends- the spring tab felt a little flimsy and were difficult to get the proper angle and correct movement in a tight areaOverall... does the Job, I have no worries of flying out of the car."
3,Pricey for what you get,"This is a strong case that fits both my Sandisk Sansa E-260 and Koss KSC-75 headphones. However, my perceived value for this case is at a maximum of ~$3.00. $10 is quite expensive."
2,"Well made, but too big",The egg shaped case is made very well but too big for earphones. Koss makes good products. It would be nice to see a more compact case for their earphones.
3,Fits my Porta Pros fine,Just the right size to hold my Porta Pros when I travel. I'm glad I purchased this item. Seems well constructed too.
2,Does the job but too big,The case does the job but is way too big and not something you will carry around with you. Should be flat enough that it at least could be stowed in a briefcase like computer bag.
3,Audio is good but Wiring is poor,"The sound quality is good, the over the ear design allows me to hear what is around me and the ear clips sty put on my cycling trips. All that's good. However the wires that connect to the 3.5mm jack are not held in the jack well at all and after some use I have found that I get intermittent failure in the left earpiece. Annoying when it really can't be saving that much in production costs."
1,"Worthless, not even worth $2.00 because it doesn't work","This is a cheap replica of another item, I wish I had not purchased it. Absolutely no suction. I actually purchased two of them at $1.99, and wasted my money."
1,Worthless,I did a little study of face vacuuming. Neither this handheld vacuum nor a household vaccum will remove my blackheads.
1,Got this at the Dollar Tree!,"I bought this exact same vacuum at the Dollar Tree for $1! It does work, for a little while, then it loses suction and doesn't work anymore. But for the few days it does work it really does help bring zits to the surface faster. It's just not worth what's being charged for it here. I mean, if you could get 100 of them for that price so you can dispose of the broken one and use another, then it would be worth it. But it was barely worth the dollar I originally paid for it."
1,Crystal Gayle in fine voice but this CD is damaged.,"The short problem and answer here is the disc and the manufacture who pressed it.Songs 1 through 8 are fine. Track 9 through 20 are damaged.I purchased two of these and both show the same problems and defects. Skipping, short bursts of sound, clicking noise etc etc."
5,For the price . . .,"it's a wonderful book, and in color to boot. If you want to have a book illustrating Picasso's works, then you won't go wrong getting a hold of this. It's loaded."
3,It is just French,"English is my second language. I have learned a lot about how books are importan in learning the language. I would not buy this textbook if my professor did not make me to do this. The organization is not good. Important grammar things are not high lighted. Explenation is not good either. Also, there is no phonetic. I still have hard time to read in French, even Iknow that there are some rules. If students know them, they can read without problems. There are tonnes of cheaper books, and I believe a lot of them are better than this book."
5,Worth it,I am glad that I chose to purchase my textbook through this seller. I received my book quickly and it was in great shape. I now purchase all books for myself and family through Amazon.
5,mariah carey is amazing!,"i cannot believe that she can sing that well! she has such a big range! one sweet day isa magical song, and it is definetely one of my favorites!"
2,One Sweet Sleeper,"Arguably, when it comes to duets, they often don't get any attention in the music industry. Ironically, when they do, they possibly seem to get overdone within the process. That happened to be the case with Mariah Carey & Boyz II Men, with their duet, or should I say quintet performance on One Sweet Day. The song is a good one at first, but definitely gets to become quite a sleeper. The 5 were very big songs at the time, but they seem like they're all trying to out do each other, and not really sing to their heart and the content. Still, it is unlikely Boyz II Men and Mariah Carey will ever conjure a duet, quintet like this ever again."
1,zzzzzzzz....oh it's over,a snoozer of a movie that turned out to be a format to hear the lead actress sing...the movie is pathetic...don't bother...The best part of the movie was the ending credits....sorry...we wasted money on this one....
2,dont bother,"Slow moving, predictable and not the least exciting. Really, this is at most a made for TV fill time movie"
5,Must Have,"I already had this cookbook. Bought three more for gifts. I actually got rid of most of my other cookbooks. Miss Mary was a genius in the kitchen!!!!! This is a true southern cookbook. I lived in the south for ten years, and have never eaten at a restaurant even close to as good as Miss Mary's Boarding House. When I am back on the east coast, if I am within 6 hours of Lynchburg I make the drive. That is how much I enjoy this place."
5,southern mama,I was so very happy to get this book. Other than a small rip in the cover it looks brand new. Great cookbook and wonderful stories. I was so happy that I could afford it.
2,Not Too Impressed,"My parents met in a boarding house in Dallas, so I expected this one to have more of the stories that I have heard from them, like the ""boarding house reach"" means that you have to keep one foot on the floor when reaching for the food. The recipes are not anything special. I am just not happy with the cookbook although I was attracted to it by it name."
2,Why not call it Jack Daniel's Boarding House,"I love Southern cooking but am disgusted by this book. They make mention that Miss Mary Bobo did not allow spirits across her doorway, yet the Jack Daniel's company decided to disregard how the woman was. They even made a point in saying that on dish every meal has Jack Daniels in it. Well the joke is on them, there are several recipes that I wanted to try but they have Jack Daniel's in it. I am just going to leave it out. If you are going to do a cookbook about a boarding house that has been around for generations leave the recipes alone. I borrowed the book from the library to see if I liked it before I bought it. It has saved me some money because I am taking the recipes I want and not wasting my money on the book. It has also saved me from wanting to visit the area since Jack Daniels must own the city of Lynchburg by now."
5,one of my favorite albums.,"Awesome album...Heavy, groovy, melodic. Index Case are extremely talented and it's a shame they'll go unheard by the world. This cd is just perfect. I listen to it on a daily basis. Pick it up!"
3,best metal I've hears in quite a while,"Don't know what to say for sure. If you like death or thrash metal this probably don't apply to you. For me personally this is the best metal cd I've heard since Korn's first cd. Not to say it sounds like that cd, but to me personally it is the first cd I've heard since then that has sounded that dark and powerfull. 'Between Us' might be the song I've heard since ""Blind"", and there are a handfull of songs on this cd I like nearly as well. Whether this review interests you or not listen to a few sample songs and jugde for yourself. Personally I think this cd is great, and will unfortunately never get the recognition it deserves.My suggestions on best tracks - ""the L"", ""Silent Side of You"", ""Between Us"", ""Sincere"". And ""Listen"", ""II"", and ""Deserver"" are pretty good too."
1,wow,"i bought this cd after reading all the ""raving"" reviews. what the hell? are you all actually listening to this junk. i was dissapointed to say the least. i wish it would have been better because the singer actually has a decent voice. the lyrics are written by an 8 year and the music is really generic. but thats what all you kids are listening to these days. junk."
2,"Salem: Place, Myth, and Memory","I took Dane Morrison's graduate Historiography class 10 years ago. He taught me that one can learn more about an historian (Morrison etal) than about history (Salem) when reading history. The chapter about Salem's religious history seems to have been written by a Harvard Divinity School Pagan; half the chapter is about Laurie Cabot. The chapter about the House of Seven Gables tells us nothing of value or interest. I guess she didnt like what she read in my term paper about the House; the reason I didnt get a good grade in her Archeology class. Shultz' chapter on Hawthorne excellent. Chapter on crimes excellent (I know Mike Szczuka,sp?); I've read her fiction. Overall good. But the anti-Conservative Christian bias is a downer."
4,"If there is a genre of ""road movie""","This is definitely one you'll want to see. Great music by Henry Mancini, great song ""Ask me no questions, and I'll tell you no lies."" Sweeps through America's back roads with a minimalist cinematography that pays homage to the landscape and the cultural landscape. The story has many allegories of human desires, triumphs and foibles. Sally Fields is HOT!! as the hooker with a heart. Tommy Lee Jones in one of his best roles, somewhat reminiscent of his role in ""Rolling Thunder"" done earlier. Add this one to your collection."
5,Back Roads,"Back Roads starring Sally Fields and Tommy Lee Jones is one of my husband and my favorite movies. We were thrilled to be able to find it on Amazon.com as we lost the copy we made on video. It's a classic comedy featuring these outstanding actors in their prime--as funny, romantic, and outrageous as can be with an unforgettable theme song--one you'll want to watch again and again!"
3,Oldie but Goodie,"This movie is somewhat dated but still very cute and entertaining. See Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones many years younger...would recommend for light, fun entertainment. Guys might say it's a chick flick!"
2,A casting problem,"This is, of course, only my opinion. This movie would have been a great opportunity for a new actress to debut. I could not believe ""Sally Fields"" in this role. Her past films affected me while watching this movie. A new actress might have been willing to put more realism into the character than a well known actress, afraid to show any skin. This is a prostitute. To be a good film requires enough realism to convince us. Other recent movies have fallen short of greatness because of this same short coming, lack of realistic portrayal of the character, thus the two stars."
3,Straw Fishing Hat NATURAL/ TAN BAND X - Large,WE BOUGHT 2 HATS A XL & A LARGE THE HATS LOOK THE SAME IN THE PHOTOS BUT THE XLARGE WAS MADE HEAVIER THEN THE LARGE .THE XL WAS THE BETTER BUY FOR THE MONEY (3 STARS FOR THE X LARGE & 2 STARS FOR THE LARGE)
4,"Nice product, a bit pricey","Pros: It works as advertised, small.Cons: This product is unidirectional! There is both the RCA Coaxial to Toslink Optical Converter, and a Toslink Optical to RCA Coaxial Converter. Just because you can connect your two pieces of hardware, doesn't mean it will work. Also, the unit requires power."
2,Good Intro - but terribly out-of-date so of marginal value,"This is a good introduction to Perforce.However it is quite *OBSOLETE* at the time of this review (Aug-2012) - and because of that is of marginal use.A new edition desperately needs to be written. There has been a *lot* of changes since '05 which this book does not cover (p4sandbox for example, streams for another)."
2,A wolf in sheep's clothing,"Well, I'm disappointed. I'm new to Perforce and found Perforce's documentation a bit unwieldy so I thought this book would help. I was wrong. What I was *hoping* this book would do was to provide a tutorial on getting set up and started, then serve as a reference on how to do at least some of the common things that you'd frequently need to do. Unfortunately, the book doesn't help with any of that.The book isn't organized so as to be useful as a reference, and it doesn't really offer much (if any) help on how to get started. Instead the book spends most of its space on discussions on advanced topics (branching, merging, automated builds, and so forth). It also focuses mainly on the command-line interface rather than the GUI.I'm sure this book is useful for some, but it sure wasn't what I was looking for."
4,Just what I Needed!,This book has everything I needed to advance my reef tank knowledge. Very informative.
4,"The Reef Aquarium: Science, Art, and Technology, Vol. 3",I have found the volume 3 very interesting because even if it treats many matters as the precedents books it is done in a better way. Especially it clearly explains the new and recent technologies.For this reason I am very happy to possess this book.
4,"The Reef Aquarium : Science, Art and Technology, Vol 3","Great read with all the information you would need to create, maintain, and sustain a reef tank. However, the book can be overwhelming with information about every theroy out there about filtration, etc., with out really recommending the best approach/technology to maintaining reef systems. For a beginner, it was a lot of reading to get what I needed. Overall, I would buy it again."
2,disappointing,"boring,monotonous every chapter is remarkably similar with different locations,no dept to characters and is constantly reiterating that he is not a criminal.a very dull representation of troubled times"
4,Fascinating Read,"Mr. Gardner is not to be taken lightly. A good portion of the book is about his exploits as a younger lad when violence in football was more common. The stories are quite amazing and you just wonder how he would get out of some of those situations. However, out of all the great stories in the book, what I find speaks most to me is what sort of character Bill Gardner is. That is what I respect the most. His themes of honor and courage speak volumes of what people have forgotten in recent times. This man has values and will not sacrifice them for the sake of saving himself. I would give the book 5-stars based off Mr. Gardner. This is a role model who doesn't realize or wouldn't want that sort of attention. Excellent book."
2,below expectation,I bought this product in excitement but when received the mouse wasnt working well and the keyboard does not respond after 1.5m range. I mean there are equally or lesser priced products in the market that provide at least 20 ft range for wireless IR but this product did not. It is sleek looking however. Returned it at the first opportunity. I am sure Kensington makes great products but how could they just be charging almost $70 for the product and does not think about where the wireless industry is going. I could've gotten Bluetooth keyboard and mouse for the same price or lesser.
1,Wireless??,"I ordered this to work with my iMac and when it arrived it was missing the USB port connector ... I tried to call to find out what to do but had to give up as no number was found to call to report a problem .. I finally sent an email and got a response form 'Hajib' or something to the like. I informed them by email that I needed to send this back and finally got the instructions to mail it back. I then had to re-box it and bring it to the post office for delivery. A real 'Pain'. I made a point in my email that I wanted credit to my account and I would be buying the keyboard locally.6/7 days later what pops up on my doorstep? You guessed it .. another keyboard. I called UPS and told them to return to sender.As for the Kensigton keyboard and mouse .. well, I bought another brand locally for a few bucks more and no hassles.Al"
2,Not really for Mac,"Works well on a WinTel PC, if you keep it on the same desktop as the PC. Keep away from any other cordless/wireless/radios or both will be adversely effected.The update software didn't make it fully functional for the Mac, but at least it sees it now.Be sure to keep a LARGE supply of batteries. They go faster than free food at a family reunion."
5,I only need the keyboard and it rocks.,"In the very beginning, I really would say this product is awesome. For a basic wireless keyboard, I don't need so many extra function keys on my keyboard, since I will never get used to use them. All I need is to have a keyboard with good feelings of typing. The design is good. Keys are so quiet and comfortable. It makes you want to type in front of your computer all the time. Why bother with the mouse which comes together with this set? I got many mice at home, so just threw the combining mouse away. The last thing I would mention was that the USB receiver was located under the mouse (in side of the mouse)...... I have no idea why they put it so undercovered. Anyway, the mouse is ugly. Once you found the receiver, the installation will be so easy. Put the receiver into USB port, then your keyboard is ready to use."
1,BEWARE!!!!,"This item looks great and works great but only under one condition:YOU MUST BE WITHIN 2 FEET OF THE WIRELESS RECEIVER (LITERALLY) FOR THE MOUSE TO WORK!!!I returned this because this totally defeated the purpose of a WIRELESS keyboard, if i had to be 2 feet away from the damn computer. I bought this to hookup my laptop to my tv and sit about 10 feet away- very bad product for that purpose."
1,POS,"I wanted to love this keyboard. Small footprint was great for a crowded desk, and I loved the style. It ended up being nothing but problems. The keyboard would frequently cut out, or one press of a key would result in 5-10 of the letters appearing on the screen. First I put foam on the battery door to keep the connections and that seemed to work for a while but eventually the problems kept coming back and out to the trash it went. I'm back to using USB keyboards and mice, but I think I'll try Logitech- I have had great success with their wireless mice on my laptops. As I said, it's too bad- the design of this keyboard is great."
1,Not that practical...,"I had this for a few months and for a time it worked perfectly. About a week ago the wireless connection started to short out. The keyboard would only work in certain places and the mouse was VERY finicky. I tried changing out the batteries and the USB port it was plugged into, but still the same problem. The design of the USB receiver leaves something to be desired, with the end sticking out so far on that thin piece, leaves room for it to break if bumped. (that is what happened as well.) When calling the Kensington Warranty folks to cash in on the 5-year warranty... nope, the problem was due to misuse.... Misuse?? bumping the computer? Not a good experience AT ALL."
1,I do not care at all for this keyboard.,Never have I wanted to take an electronics item to the roof of my building and toss it off.1. The mouse is flaky after about one year of use. Gently whacking it on your desktop usually gets it too work.2. The MAC key. I am a windows user. There is a MAC key (it looks like a cute little apple) right where I am use to having my control key. I use keyboards shortcut frequently. The mac key and its positioning is a problem since I usually hit it and not the control key.3. Sensitivity - I have large hands. The keys on this keyboard a close enough that I frequently hit mutilple keys at once.I hope this helps...
4,"Nice Keyboard, Mouse a little weird","Generally, I was pleased with this purchase. I have a problem with some stiffness in my finger because of typing to hard on traditional keyboards, so this thing was perfect for me. I think I actually type faster on this thing. Great tactile feel.As for the mouse, it doesn't really seem like a 1000dpi mouse, and the low profile takes some getting use to. It's a little strange, but I'm sure after a couple of months it should be fine. I just wish it was a little more precise.So, generally, very pleased with the product. The only other complaint about it is that the dongle has to be really close to the keyboard and mouse. So, don't pick this thing up if you're planning on using it more than 15 inches away from the dongle."
1,no cap light on (decent) keyboard but mouse is HORRIBLE!,"Decent keyboard with both Mac and PC buttons, a soft touch... until all the keys stuck, no cap light either. Crappy heavy mouse too. Save your money!!"
2,Windows Users,I just plugged in my wieless keyboard and it cant find any of the drivers for it. I have windws 7 and I went to the webssite and they only have a MAX OS image file .dmg so you have to go convert it then burn it to the disk but keep saying its invalid. If I dont get it to work byt tommrow im returning it.
1,good product,"Keyboard is great. Help with adapting this to a Mac they want to charge for which I don't think is right. So I fumbled, found a download and all is well."
3,Kensington Wireless Keyboard/mouse combo,"This is a thin lightweight wireless keyboard purchased to use with a MAC mini. Some of the favorable features of this combo is that the keys on the qwerty keyboard are large and comfortable and the keyboard sensitivity is preferable over other keyboards I have used. The keyboard is comfortable in my lap. Since I prefer using an ergonomic type mouse, this particular mouse is flat and it isn't as comfortable in my hand and the scroll wheel is a bit rigid. Overall, this combo is sleek and attractive in appearance and it gets the job done!"
2,not the right color,"This keyboard has several nice features: very compact, which allows it to pack easily in a laptop bag or aluminum briefcase for air travel as carry-on; silent keys; stylish design. Unfortunately, the color is silver, not titanium grey. I had to return it and pay the return postage.I ended up going with the Logitech Classic 200 and a red Logitech optical mouse, all for $35 total instead.Many people had complained here about the reliability of the Kensington wireless.The Logitech looks great, matches with my Dell Studio 17 in red color, and is compact enough to pack inside my 2 laptop cases. It's a USB wired keyboard paired with a wireless mouse, but in fact the keyboard is not inconvenient and never misses a keystroke nor has repeated entries, which seems to be a problem with this Kensington model.I use my laptop for typical Office stuff, plus Internet and intensive calculations.Frequent traveller."
2,"eh, I'm not impressed.","First of all, the description states this product is ""Titanium"". Perhaps the color resembles titanium but it's all plastic. I was disappointed. Second, the keyboard randomly stops responding. Not sure why.I'm a graphic designer. While using this mouse I found that the double click almost always gets stuck. I hated using it when I needed to work.I returned this product and would not buy it again. Perhaps if you need this for regular, everyday use it will suite you."
3,"Great crockpot, crappy lid!","I love this crockpot. I now have, however, a lid without a handle. The plastic handle is just a bad design, period. Its not snug enough that funk won't get underneath it if you soak it, so it traps gunk in there. There is no way to tighten it when it starts to loosen. Eventually mine came off in my hand. I will still use the lid with a pliers because I like the crockpot itself. Whatever happened to the design where the lid and the handle were all one piece of glass? Bring that back!"
1,Definitely cooks too hot on low,"I have owned a LOT of crockpots. In fact, as we speak I not only have this one, but also a 1 quart, 3 quart, 7 quart and 18 quart. I liked the pretty looks of this one, but I agree with the other reviewers that said it cooks too hot on the low temperature. You MUST have your crockpot about 3/4 full or so to avoid it. High liquid recipes like broth based soups are ok, but thicker food like stew, chili, etc. are inclined to burn if left for a long time."
4,Rival Crock Pot,This crock pot is very good. I had the smart crock pot last and it just overcooked everything I made. I was beginning to think I just couldn't use a crock pot anymore. This one does exactly what it's supposed to do. Makes dinner delicious and easy. I usually leave the crockpot on from 6:30 am to 5:00 pm and everything comes out perfect. I've used this crock pot more in the last 2 months than I used the other one in over a year.
1,Broken Low Setting,The LOW setting is actually HIGH. Burns food severely within 2 hours. Went to manufacturer for new one. Would have ruined Thanksgiving if I hadn't tested it ahead of time. Tested it twice on 2 favorite recipes. Same results.
5,Easy Cooking,"When you are unable to stand by your stove to cook a meal, this crockpot can do the cooking for you without you standing by. Since I have ""MS"", it is sometimes difficult for me to stand. I can have a wonderful dinner waiting for me in the crockpot, plus when I fix a larger portion of food(s) in it, I would have enough for two meals."
5,Excellent!,"My book arrived in excellent condition and in record time. I thought it was used, and I paid so little that my classmates are jealous! I am happy. Thank you."
4,Good starter book,"Just learning how to play the piano but this book seems to be a good start. It explains the key arrangements, hand placements and answers a lot of beginner questions. There are instructions on reading music and understanding the scales.There are a number of increasingly difficult practice sessions. It's an easy read and I'm hoping it will get me a good foundation.I checked out several books from our local library to see which is best. I felt this is the best one of the bunch.Wish I can tell you more but I'm just getting started on the piano."
2,One Stupid Movie!,"Mourning Wood has gotten some really positive reviews on horror websites. After watching the movie, I think the reviewers who liked it must be on drugs. It is a very stupid movie with only a couple of funny moments. Very little gore, too. I'd say to avoid this even if you like Lloyd Kaufman's Troma movies. This makes his movies look like masterpieces in comparison."
4,silly stupid hilarious,"I am used to indie and very low budget, so was not expecting much from this film. I was cracking up the whole time...there is a lot of subtle weirdness, bad acting (ina funny way!), dumb jokes but surprisingly good makeup and effects .. sound track is pretty nice .. its stonerish. I think anyone who has attempted to make films and is into zombie type of aesthetic will find some enjoyment here."
1,Made by SOUTH PARKS Kissin' Cousins ???,"Wow,What a STRANGE TRIP(ed,) this flick was,OUCH !Totally bizarre comedy premise about unusual products that may turn users into zombies.These jokers are hoping you are drunk when renting films or high...Some of the comedy bits would work for all TROMA fare.Hey,It (film) was amusing,if not ingratiating to fans of low humor and bathroom/bedroom antics by college pranksters."
2,"Long, Boring and slow","I started with an expectation of something that would be fast paced; however, this was not to be. Sculley's style is repetitive and slow. He makes a point in a couple of paragraphs and then goes on and on about the same thing. He also gives too much importance to his personal life in the book."
5,GREAT optics with unparalleled results,Phenomenal resultsI cosidered buying the zoom 70-200 with f2.8 or the 70-400 with f4-f5.6Eventualy I bought the 70-200 with f2.8 wich is a piece of GREAT optics with unparalleled resultsAND the 2X convertorMost of the time I need the 70-200 and when I'm taking wildlife pictures I'm using the 2X -For me its a win-win
5,She can certainly grow on you!,"I was introduced to Jann Arden when I searching for lyrics and I discovered her amazing song, ""Hangin' By A Thread"" and it reflected my pain, heartbreak, and sorrow during that time in my life. When I first listened to ""Cherry Popsicle"" I was astonished to how much I could relate to her lyrics, her humor, and pain. This is wonderful purchase and every song on the album is wonderful especially with ""Sleepless"", ""Mend"", ""Best Dress"" and others."
4,Happier but less substance,"Jann's music plumbs emotional depths, and stimulates a view of the world that sometimes is quite depressed. However, her music also celebrates the joy of love, and friendship. This album is more upbeat than her classic previous album, Happy?, but it doesn't touch the emotional range that that one did. Sleepless is a wonderful song, and most people will find it rather addictive. There are many enjoyable songs on this album, and some are clearly playful and humorous. It just doesn't rank up with her best, in my opinion."
5,THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL CD!,"First let me say that I just love all of Jann Ardens music. I get her. She is an amazing songwriter. She is an amazing singer. This cd has a little bit of everything, and everything is great. Some songs are very melancholy, and others are upbeat. My favourite song is ""Taste of This"". This song makes me feel so romantic, and in love, with life. Very sexy song. Very sensual. Every song on this cd is great. You will feel happy, sad, flirtatious. It is a very therapeutic cd. Buy it, you will not be disappointed. I have been playing it everynight, since I bought it. I take it in the car with me when I go out. The songs are very addictive. Thank you Jann Arden for this wonderful cd. And thank you for your past cd's, which I still listen too. I just never get sick of her music at all. I will be the fist in line for her next cd. Can't wait."
3,Right down the middle,"Best Track: Piece of it AllI really wanted to like this CD.I like Jann's voice, and her style--but Blood Red Cherry just left me wanting to listen to some of her earlier stuff.Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad album, it just didn't touch me at all.It is still filled with Jann's artistical style of songwriting that can leave the listener knowing exactly how she feels."
1,Don't waste your money,"Just wanted to say that this game is horrible. We had the first version and, even though it had a few glitches, it was fun. This one's glitches are way worse. You can do the same shot over and over again and get very different results. Also, you don't get much range of where you want to aim and where it lands is crazy - you can't tell most the time if you're in the rough or what. Read decent reviews, but.... don't think they played the first one. The first one was way more realistic in its pictures, where you aimed and where the ball ended up. Also, you weren't asked if your husband played - very annoying."
2,A waste of Money,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband against my son's advice. He warned me that this game would be fun for about 10 minutes and never played again. Exactly what happened. The graphics are very elementary compared to video game quality. This one went into the yard sale.
5,Great Sci-Fi,"I really love this set of books, especially the first one! He uses real science to ""explain"" his points. Different take on things, for sure."
5,The origin of man.,"This story spun by James Hogan draws you in and doesn't let go. Don't start this book unless you have a lot of time on your hands, you will not want to put it down. The plausible scenerio laid forth as to the origin of the human race keeps you guessing up until the end, it's one of my favorite Sci-Fi books. I have read it several times and probably will read it several more, don't pass this one up!"
1,the giants novel,the first 25 pages were missing. what was left was ok but i'm mad because of what was missing! thank you for asking
3,I really liked the first book....,"This book was recommended to me by another SF fan. He told me this was one of the best SF stories, with the sequel being one of the best sequels, and the third being one of the best trilogies. I have to disagree a little, I really liked 'Inherit the Stars' I was captivated and thouroughly enjoyed it. The second book started out good but ran flat for the middle 70% and finished with a 'this is how it happened' finish. I was disappointed they just told us the mystery through dialogue, instead of taking us through the journey like they did in 'Inherit the Stars'. The third book is totally unlike the first two almost leaving the SF category, but still enjoyable for what it was. So, in my honest opinion, get 'Inherit the Stars' and forget the other two, you would do better to spend the time having read those two on some other novel."
2,forced myself to finish,"I recently bought (and read) a few dozen science-fiction books off Amazon purely on net recommendations and reviews. This is one of the few that disappointed me. The characters feel phony (to the extent that I actually grew to loathe them), dialogue is mainly used for explaining things to the reader (almost as bad as Chrichton) and the story, third book excepted, consists mainly of boring characters solving scientific riddles thanks to fortuitous discoveries. The premise is interesting at first, but the development is so drawn out that what should be intriguing ideas feel obvious when they're finally ""discovered"" by the characters. I suppose this might be perfect for a reader who is somewhat slow on the uptake."
1,Is this SF?,"For what it is worth: I am highly dubious if this is SF. It may be enjoyable to science buffs who are into Space Age stuff like Sputniks and Apollo, but otherwise it lacks anything which makes a book SF, most notably a readable story.Warning: do not try to read this unless you have a lot of time and really nothing else to do: after some pages of this book sweeping the floor the will look like high entertainment."
5,Made me wish I was a real scientist.,"All of the giants novels stand alone as foul-proof stories, but I was most impressed by the original story; Inherit the Stars. The brief intro on the back had me captivated. I found myself following the events in the other books simply because of the strength of the main characters. The only fault I could think of was that Mr.Hogan went into too much detail on the biology of the other species and not enough into the structure of their societies. I know this was due to the two species he did cover remarkably well being the main characters for all the stories. But they were so different it becomes necessary to find out what other types of life the Thuriens have discovered in the last 25 million years. Role on the next book."
2,Bigger rip-off than final rip-off,"First of all, this book is neither big, nor red. It's quite thin actually, and is blue. There is limited new material in it, and the actual new material isn't very special. This doesn't seem like a Monty Python product at all. It was probably thrown together at the last minute. I purchased this today, finished it an hour ago, and I'm still frustrated with it. However, I purchased the ""First 280 years of Monty Python"" book, and really like it so far. ""The Pythons"" is also good, but is kind of all over the place, but ""280 years"" is mainly focused on the television show. So in conclusion, hesitate on this one, unless you think it will be the last Python book you'll ever buy."
2,"Causes Insomnia, should probably avoid.","I took 6 pills for two days, and was unable to fall asleep as a result of these vitamins. A co-worker recommended these to me, and when he increased his dose to about the same, he also had trouble sleeping. It probably causes the adrenaline levels to increase and keeps the mind active, even if the body is very tired. There is no denying that the vitamins are effective, however, its the wrong kind of effectiveness if you ask me."
3,Taste is pretty bad - like rotten veggies,"I have to be honest, I have a very hard time taking these and at times have gagged and nearly vomited from the taste. I had to stop using them."
5,Excellent Flaxseed!!,"I really do prefer the ground flax over the whole seed. It's easier to add to things and go unnoticed and it creates texture and volume to things you add it to. You can really use it on just about anything that you want an added nutrient kick to. Try adding it to ground turkey or chicken tacos (after cooking), it adds volume, for lack of a better word, to the meat.. Really good."
2,Didn't Care for the Taste,"Simply didn't care for the taste and texture if the flaxseed. I would recommend wheat germ instead as it has similar health benefits. I dropped candy (well, almost) and combined fish oil, wheat germ, exercise, and limited my red meat intake to get my cholesterol down from 209 to 135 (without Lipitor). While the flaxseed may do the same, as advertised, it's difficult to mix into various foods (my dad likes it on peanut-butter), and alters the taste and texture."
1,great,Im sure it would have been great to get from here but I never got my order. Bought the same at the health food store and it is great stuff.
3,We'll Meet Again,"The CD was in excellent condition as advertised. This was not the version of this song I was looking for, but that was my fault. I would have prefered a later version of Vera Lynn singing it."
1,Worked for few months and died,"I do not it is too harsh to give this product 1 star for the following reasons.1) This thing that we spent big bucks on died within just a few months.2) We need to hassle with packing the item and paying for shipment to get it repaired even though it is still under warranty.3) If you do not want to have less hassle of packing the product to ship it for warranty repair, you are supposed to keep the original box as I was reminded by a customer service rep. Then, I asked myself. Should I rent storage to keep boxes of all products I buy because I expect to send them in for warranty repair at my own cost or I choose to only buy the products from manufacturers that truly honor their warranty and replace the defective products without having me go though extra hassle and expense? Obviously, I will not be a repeat customer for any Watertech products."
1,"junk, worst customer service",warning do not buy unless you want to replace this every 2 years with less than 6 months of use.The pump motor is made in china
5,A Good Second Piaf,"Once she has won your heart, you will want this collection to hear how she developed as a performer -- and came to be a great symbol of France in the 20th Century"
4,This was a better than average book,"This is actually a serious look at the role of TV anchors, done by someone who is a producer. I read the book several years ago, and I recall that there was an effort to look seriously beyond the personalities of the TV anchors, and into the role of the anchor. At that time, it was a glamorous profession, with Rather, Jennings and Browkaw. With the exit of all three from the anchor spot, and the considerable decline in TV's ratings power with the advent of the internet, this book captures a bit of the struggle for the top job, at a time when it meant something. She's not Ben Badikian, the well known critic who seriously explored media concentration, but she's not the National Enquirer either. This should be in journalism schools everywhere, at least for showing how little of TV anchor duties really have to do with journalism."
4,This Old House got it right!,"I am a general contractor and saw this product on an episode of This Old House. This is a great tool for hanging cabinets! You can be extremely precise and the hanging process goes much easier not struggling with a cabinets weight or having to nail a board on the wall, when you have a wall surface that is finished. highly recommend"
3,t-jak reveiw,"the discription of the item indicated it was more convient to use, it is not hard to use just inconvienent."
2,"Very awkward for ceilings, great for cabinets","Purchased this to hang drywall on ceilings as advertised. The cleats are rudimentary and the 400lb capacity Jak is way overkill for a sheet of drywall. The real problem is lifting one edge of drywall over your head to a height of 8' (bending, cracking, difficult to position in tight spots), inserting the edge under the cleats, reaching for the T-Jak and adjusting the sliding nut to a height that will support the other edge of drywall. The instructions are completely inadequate - no tips or hints on making this awkward process safer or easier. Three sheets came crashing down around me before I could get them positioned.The T-Jak is just great for hanging cabinets. The adjusting nut means you can dial in cabinet height exactly. If you hang cabinets often, this is the tool.I'm a home repair professional. If I had to do it again, I would probably purchase the 3rd Hand as a more versatile addition to my business."
3,Somewhat useful,"I used this (and a friend) to help hang a drywall on the ceiling of my basement. While the tool made the job much easier it still was difficult to get the jack into place to hold the board. In the end I ended up renting a drywall lift for a week for about the same price as this tool and got the job done in one weekend by myself. It would have take 2-3 times as long with a helper just using the jack. If you are working alone hanging drywall and care about time, skip this and just rent a drywall lift from a local rental store. You won't ever regret the decision."
4,It's definetly an extra hand,"I am not a contractor or a handyman. I am just trying to finish my basement on my own to save money. I bought T-Jak to be able to attach 2x4 to the basement ceiling to avoid some pipes before attching drywall. With T-jak holding 2x4, I was able to attach 40 of them in one day. The metal rods are strong, I do think that they can hold 400lbs, however, the plastic ends, base and top are not that strong. I will have to attach to a stronger and much biger base & top to use this unit for drywalling.It's worth every penny I spent on it."
3,Good tool,"I've used this for putting in cabinets and it almost makes a one man job. I still need an assist lifting large cabinets onto the jacks. I have used these for quite a few other things as well--adding an extension to a table saw, assembling a lathe, etc. I would not use it for installing drywall. It's just too awkward. I would give it 4 stars if it weren't so spendy. It's just pipe, threaded rod and some plastic parts."
1,ONE HERO,"This score has only one Hero, the main cello theme for the whole movie. The rest of the score is mostly a constant rambling of music so simular to Tan Dun's Crouching Tiger I found it ruined the movie for me. The main cello theme is huanting and sad like the movie. The price of this disc is even sadder. Go for Crouching Tiger or The Last Samurai by Hans Zimmer."
1,Good idea but badly done,"The idea for this book is good but the book was badly done. Unexpected style is something that intrigues me, but that's not what this book actually is. The book is pretty dated in the way it is done because it's all about one unknown designer's ""take"" on decorating. No one today wants to be dictated to or to just copy what another person has done. So this book misses the mark by several miles. If you want a decorating book that helps you create your own style, this is not it. Don't buy this. It seems more like a book about this designer's own ego."
1,A big waste of my money,"I've never heard of this author, but I bought the book anyway, which was my mistake. I did not find one new thing in the entire book. I've read it all before. I've read the same ideas in other books and magazines many, many times over the years. There is nothing original in this book, so I am really disappointed."
5,inspirational,"fabulous pictures, great color and insightful comments. the book is packed full with different ideas to create an exciting environment."
5,Remarkable Design,"I can't believe what a strong emotional effect these Kelly Wearstler interior designs have on me--some I love, some give me the creeps, but they all have such wit and power that I find myself looking at this book again and again--and I'm a shabby chic kind of gal. Of course it's disturbing that she features herself in so many of the photographs but I think she's a genius. Most design books have pictures of rooms are nice, or cozy, or calm. These are rooms are glamorous, smart, and sexy.Since I bought this book I've seen Wearstler's influence spreading everywhere. I just wish I could afford her to decorate my house."
1,Enough already!,"More bad design from LA -- I live here, so it's personal -- via yet another over-styled, over-hyped -- well, whatever they're being called (this month).Bottom line: Hicks did it already. More to the point, he did it authentically. Which means he did it far, far better than the silly replications being peddled as ""Modern Glamour"" here.And ""The Art of Unexpected Style?"" Please. Enough already with the matching yellows. The cover tells you everything you need to know about this silly book. No need to look further.My recommendation: Pass on this one. Quickly."
2,"Narcissitic drivel, but some great photos","I bought this book thinking it would actually discuss design, but all it talks about is the author's/designer's methodologies, not necessarily exploring other facets or designers of glamorous style. Also, it's littered with photos of Kelly, nearly 20 to be exact. Are they all of her working in her surroundings? No, they are her, posed like a prop in a movie set, sitting at the beach or gazing at antiques on her fabulous travels. What? They do nothing to reinforce her work, it seems only to prove how fabulous she is. Her designs are quite beautiful and sumptuous, but reading about 'me' and 'my' and 'I' gets tiring. Pretty to look at, I suppose good reading material if you can't fall asleep. I kinda wish I had bought this book used instead of paying full price."
3,"cute, with some real laughs","Filmed in Massachusetts, us natives had fun recognizing stuff. Good actors fooling around. The laughs are worth your time. Have fun."
4,"Quirky, indeed","The jacket labels this movie as ""quirky,"" and for once the copy is right. The cast is interesting, including a generally restrained Christopher Walken, an earnest Morgan Freeman, an unrestrained Bill Macy, and an interestingly layered Marcia Gay Harden. Worth a viewing."
3,MY GRADE: B minus to B.,"The tale focuses upon three museum workers who are each obsessed with a different piece of art. All said the particular art pieces are being moved from the USA to Denmark and this puts them all over the edge and thus do they decide to steal the originals and replace them with believable copies. The cast is quite impressive with Morgan Freeman, William H Macy and Christopher Walken but somehow the overall show doesn't get beyond somewhat good. Their appreciation of art and Macy's attempt to not get caught during the end heist were the best parts of this picture. It could have used some more humor, too. Walken's wife, played by Marcia Gay Harden, was well done.This picture is more about the character interactions than the story.CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; HUMOR: C to C plus; ART FOCUSES: B; WHEN WATCHED: early May; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B."
4,A Nice Little Sleeper,"I had never heard of this movie until my wife brought it home. As the film had no advertising or press junket, we did not expect a great story. We were pleasantly surprised. I would not have put Christopher Walken, Morgan Freeman, and William H. Macy together, but they really complement each other. And Marcia Gay Harden fits her role perfectly. Their characters are fleshed out in subtly humorous ways.The plot follows three men living the quiet autumns of their lives. They decide to support their passion for three works of art by planning an uncharacteristically bold art heist. They slowly bumble through a security-busting plan, trying to prove to themselves that they can do it.The nuances of this film make it a quiet charmer. I recommend it for a low key evening at home."
3,"Great Cast, Great Execution, ...But","I'll purchase just about anything these actors are in. The movie has some great moments, but the whole premise of the movie is illogical. If it doesn't make sense, then it's hard to swallow. Why would intelligent, talented individuals risk going to prison to save something they don't own? Take a picture, it lasts longer."
1,Worst film In a long time,This has got to be one of the worst fimls I have seen in recent memory. It's rare that I am unable to finish a film because it is so bad. This was one of them; silly to the point of adolecent.
2,Waste of talent,"One of those movies that bring an occasional smile, but never any laughs to the viewer. Skip it."
1,Boring and unengaging,"Wow, this was a slow, boring and totally un-engaging film. I could not find anything about this story to relate to, or connect with... at all. The plot is not very interesting. The humor is NOT very funny. I never laughed out loud once. The actors are great actors, but this film did not really show anything about their abilities. I felt like it was a thrown together movie, with a small budget that just gave these actors an opportunity to work together. Some speaking segments were cliche - I didn't know movies still had ""Step on it!"" in them. It's very clean however except for one blurry video image. The ending was better than expected, but I was not expecting much.Glad some people enjoyed this film. I'm not trusting Amazon reviews anymore though. The reviews here were high, but my experience with the movie was low."
5,Strikes the Pefect Note,"Normally, I don't like films about bumbling crooks, but this film transcends that. The characters are characters, but very real. The acting is perfect. It's refreshing to see a movie with no car chases and breast implants. Overall, I found this fun and entertaining."
3,Not very funny,The previews for this movie are much funnier than the movie itself. I struggled through it and then it was sent to the garage sale pile. Fantastic cast in the movie but poor story line.
2,Maiden Heist,"OK, but you can do so much better with about anything else. Only bought it because the reserve line at the library was too long. I can't figure out why so many people were waiting to see something this weak. Excellent cast. Weak story and acting."
2,"Good cast, trite plot","I really should beware of direct-to-DVD films, but I couldn't resist a movie with Morgan Freeman, Marcia Gay Harden, William H. Macy AND Christopher Walken. Too bad their talents were made so little use of. I am a great fan of caper movies, and appreciate good satire, but I was left feeling unfulfilled by this film. I'm not sure where the director was trying to go with this movie, but I don't think he got there. Not worth a Blockbuster rental, maybe a $1 RedBox, but putting it your DVR and watching it (or not) would probably be your best cost-effective alternative."
3,Funny Men?,"British Prime Ministers (with a few memorable exceptions) learn to see themselves in a less than serious light thanks to continual press bombardment. Failed Prime Ministers see their successful colleagues in a more comical light still. So it is that Kenneth Baker, who rose to the dizzy heights of Education Secretary, has compiled this collection of irreverent cartoons from across the ages of politics, lambasting the great and the bad in equal measure, right up to John Major. There are some genuinely funny moments, but a lot has changed in art and humour since 1840 and some sections of the book are for fanatic cartoonists only."
2,Only one reason i liked,"ok this movie was fairly ok but there is only one reason i liked it....IT WAS FILMED AT MY HIGHSCHOOL lol. I know a lot if the cast, I met Ben and Jason. I was in the audience when they were performing the show and it was actually really cool watching how a movie was filmed...granted i had to do the same thing like 15 times lol it was really interesting and was fun to be a part of it. Overall i can give 2 to 3 stars if you like movies about music."
4,Yeats and Alchemy,"Yeats found in alchemy a pliable discourse that could represent the range of relationships between spirit and matter, whether separated or merged, harmonious or divisive. He also saw in alchemy a multifaceted metaphor for transformation, as it applied to both art and the human psyche. Alchemy was the poetic precursor to modern chemistry, a compensatory undercurrent to Christianity, an archetypal dream, and the science of spiritual transformation."
5,"a ""MUST READ"" for Yeats fans!",Dr. Gorski is a great writer and professor of literature! I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about Yeats or broadening their own literary horizons.Does this mean bonus points for me? *grin*
3,Grohe Relexa body spray,"product appears as pictured. It was brushed chrome in appearance. There are no adjustments possible, it just sprays straight out. If this is what you want in a body spray, then this will serve your needs."
5,Just as expected!,"Be sure you are ordering the wrong size. This didn't particularly mention large shank or small shank, and it happened to be the wrong size for what I needed (it was large, i needed small). None the less, the peice was quality and cheaper here than in the local store by $20."
3,Better than I thought it would be,"The Bacon Brothers are an actual rock band and not the vanity project so many other bands with movie star front men turn out to be. Kevin Bacon sings with authority and when his lack of range betrays him, he still attacks each song with gusto. Michael's voice is well suited to the more folk-like sound of the songs he sings lead on, but when he tries to rock he does not quite carry it off. The songs themselves range from bad ballads like ""Paris"" and Heart Half Full"" to cute numbers like ""Baby Steps"" and ""Leave the Lava Lamp On For Me"" to truly good numbers like ""I'm So Glad I'm Not Married"" with its solid rockabilly sound and Kevin's ode to the tour bus, aptly titled ""Bus."" And with ""Summer of Love (Woodstock '99)"" Kevin writes a classic with a song that neatly sums up that particular disaster. This band is worth checking out and even though there are rough spots; you definitely get the feeling these guys are working hard."
5,"As always, the Bacon Boys CD is a real treat....","I first got hooked on their first CD ""Forosoco"" and I will admit it I first listened because it was Kevin Bacon. That lasted for about half a second and then I got very into the songs. These guys are really terrific and their third CD ""Can't Complain"" backs that up. Their lyrics are touching, funny, amusing all at the same time. The harmony is fabulous and after being lucky enough to meet them recently, I know that all their songs come from the heart. They are serious artists and deserve all the musical success they get. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes good old fashioned rock and roll!"
5,No Complaints Here!,"Of the three Bacon Brothers CD's, this one has officially become my favorite. The songs are fresh, the writing is funny and insightful, the music is a departure but a welcome edition and the band is sounding better than ever. I didn't like ""Paris"" the first couple of times but then I started to get it. Keep on listening, it gets better each time. You don't just hear ""Grace"", you feel it. ""..Lava Lamp.."", ""Light the Way"", ""Baby Steps"", ""..Married.."", and ""Bus"" are great car concert songs! Get the CD and then see the Bacon Brothers live for an even bigger treat. You'll be glad you did!"
3,"""Can't Complain"" veers away from spark of previous albums...","If you already love the Bacon Brothers...buy this album because you'll probably like it. However if you're just getting acquainted with the group, I would suggest starting with their previous album entitled ""Getting There"", which has songs with spark and passion. I felt that ""Can't Complain"" was produced just because they could do it. The orchestrations are a nice addition to the group, but the songs themselves leave much to be desired throughout the disc. The song Baby Steps was really the only song on this disc that shows what the Bacon Brothers do really well...folk rock. I missed their playfullness. This album got really serious all of a sudden."
5,Quality kitchen faucet,Very attractive and high quality kitchen faucet. Excellent support from YourRemodel. The faucet and YourRemodel deserve rave reviews.
4,Great faucet,"We just had new granite counter tops installed with a new black silgranit sink, the fauct was that added touch our new kitchen needed. It's a very very very nice item.."
3,Not a Hit Collection,"In fact, this is really the first colaboration Raffaella did with the spanish company Hispavox....But there where some hits in this first LP... Like ""Mama dame 100 pesetas"", ""Bailo Bailo"" and ""Super Rumbas""... Of course, if you want to have some of the greatest hits of her, you should try to find a major compliation of her work with CBS (Sony)... But, this is a great sample of the talent and carrer of one of the most amazing singers that come from Italy...Enjoy!!"
4,Almost a great compilation,"This is a compilation of Carra's spanish hits made for Hispavox between 1981 - 1984. This compilation is exactly the same as other coompilations from EMI called Los Exitos, Colección Aniversario, Grandes Exitos en Español, and many more. They all include exactly the same tracklist but differ in the art covers whis is not much but Los Exitos. If you want you can try All her recordings for Hispavox Vol 1 (2008) and vol 2 (2009) by Ramalama, they include everything with more photographic material and explanations."
2,Left Hair Greasy,I used the tea tree oil in my hair for a short time. I stopped because it left my hair sticky and greasy feeling. Had to wash my hair to take it out. I maybe used to much but this product is not for me. I went back to the Organic Root Stimulator Olive oil.
1,cheap stuff,i wore this no longer than 2 weeksthe watch belt broke becasue they used clue to attach joints
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book SUCKED! First of all, the entire first half of this book had nothing to do with the migration process. Second, the parts of this book that did deal with actual migration were very skimpy, and full of misinformation. It almost seemed as though the authors had no knowledge whatsoever of Windows 2000 or Windows NT. I akchully think that this buuk maked me stoopider! :) In all seriousness, don't waste your money on this terrible book. If you want a book that will fully fill you in on the migration process, get MCSE: Windows 2000 Migration Study Guide by Sybex."
2,Not a good introductory book,"This book is difficult to follow, although the examples helps to clarify some of the concepts. While it might be a good reference, it is not a good introductory book for someone who didn't have any prior knowledge on copulas."
2,Thumbs Down if you are a serious traveler,"I thought I was getting a 'real' map ... unfold it, spread it out on the kitchen table type Big map with details. Not the case. The actual Map dimensions of Beijing and surrounding area, when unfolded, is ONLY 9 in. x 11 3/8 in. Only 1 in. bigger than standard print paper.There are MORE streets WITHOUT names than there are with. Then on the other side is the same size Blow up of Central Bejing.. Small! Again, not good on details. A magnifying glass is needed to find most of the other sights that Lonely planet did put on the map..... but then there no names of the streets to be able to find the sights .. only larger streets are listed.I only give it 3/4 of a star for showing the Subway stops with their name.I give them 2/4 of a star for laminating. There just wasn't much to laminate.I give them 3/4 of a star for the map index"
1,don't bother,a night light is briter....none of the homedics or conair lighted makeup mirrors have good light...obviously a man designed these...LOL
5,Lincoln's Man,"Ben Bedford is a young singer songwriter out of Springfield, Illinois. This album has received heavy play on the folk DJ stations with many of the songs reaching the top 10. Bedford is known as the American Portrait Songwriter. A listen to ""Virginia Girls, "" ""Lincoln's Man,"" ""Harley Albright,"" or ""Migrant Mother"" quickly shows why he is known by this designation. His songs are populated with fully realized American characters with a story to tell in Bedford's perfect poetic lyrics. He should be a household name in all discerning musical households across the nation. After one's first listen you are hooked and must tell others of what you have discovered. Ben's latest release Land Of The Shadows is a continuation of this wellspring of great music. Buy his music and enjoy!"
2,"Not a bible, more like a quick review","Having used Excel for a number of years and various other Excel guides, I have been disappointed each time I have tried to use this book.The worst feature? The index. Any reference book should be able to point you to where you want to go, but with only one description of most functions -- and you have to guess at which word the author will choose to pick for the index -- you're often spending more time trying to figure out the ""bible"" than you would if you were just fiddling with Excel on your own.So if you're looking for a guidebook for Excel, my opinion is to find a different book, perhaps one of the Que ""Special Edition"" series instead."
5,Who says you can't judge a book by it's cover?,"I gave this book 5 stars, but what do I know? I just bought the book because I was feeling impulsive, and it had such a pretty cover. But I will say one thing, the cover of the book is reeeealy pretty!"
3,not bad for the money,"I have 20 of these clamps in lengths from 18"" to 60"" and wouuldn't work without them. I haven't had the breakage issue that others seem to be having and I've had mine for more than five years. I tried the ""B"" brand and would have bought more of them if the handles were as big as the ones on the Jorgensen clamps. All things being equal performance wise, give me the bigger handles."
1,Buy Bessey Products,"I bought two of these, and put them to use a couple days later. I had the project all glued up and started clamping. One of the clamps broke (the pig iron in the mechanism), without my having put much pressure on it at all.When it's glue time, it's crunch time, and failures like this are inexcusable. Unless they can send me a new clamp before my glue dries, I don't care how friendly and responsive their customer service is.Since then I've purchased about 10 similar Bessey clamps, and haven't had a bit of trouble with them. I won't go back to Jorgensen--can't afford the risk."
4,I hate the Disney Channel!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"and find CBeebies far superior, BUT..I love these dudes, I find their mastery of different genres of music and catchy tunes extremely watchable. Far more likeable than The Wiggles who frankly, I find quite unsettling, and their songs are better than Hi-5, but of course they lack the cute babes of the latter ""beat-combo"". If the movers were to go on tour, I would hope that the supporting act would be those 2 blokes at the end of Jake and the Neverland Pirates who sing the amusing pirate songs, they are great as well!!"
5,FANTASTIC!,"My daughter loves the Imagination Movers and I DVR them all the time, but this saves me! Now we can watch them in any room! She loves this video! Great buy and great educational value."
5,Not Disappointed,"I ordered the item for my grandson who LOVES ""movers"". He certainly enjoyed this one as well, and requests it frequently."
3,Not enough episodes!,"My 2 year old is completely obsessed with the imagination movers and unfortunately, our DVR with DirecTV doesn't always record when we set it to...so we bought this DVD which has 4 great episodes. However, it ONLY has four episodes! I looove the movers, it is my favorite show of his, but I think I am going to go crazy if I have to watch one of these four episodes one more time. And he wants to watch it at least twice a day. I wish they had another video out. Also it was disappointing that the bonus episode wasn't a mover episode---it was Oso. Please Disney--make a decent dvd with more than just a few episodes! $20 for 4 episode just stinks."
1,Lack of imagination,"This show is not about imagining, it is about problem solving.The concept of imagination here is limited to bright colors, gadgets, pop music, goofy antics and a mouse puppet. Actual imagination movers would demonstrate how to move the mind into different ""what if"" scenarios, not a fanciful approach to problem solving with trial and error."
5,My 19-month old LOVES Imagination Movers!,"My son used to hate car rides, but now with the Imagination Movers DVD to watch in the car, he doesn't budge. They keep his attention like nothing else does and he now asks to go in the car to see them. My son is 19 months old and loves these guys! I like how this DVD had 4 different episodes so it lasts awhile!"
3,In an airplane,"This works great in an office where the noise level is not too high, in an airplane the noise is not totally canceled."
1,"Looks nice, Sounds poor","The Philips looked great and had a solid build but the Noise Canceling was very poor compared to other headphones I have tried (the old Logitechs this one was to replace, Bose QC2 and 3, and various airplane ones). How disappointing to have bought this new pair and then preferred the ones I used on the airplane.When listening to movies on my Dell laptop I had to crank the volume up to maximum, even in my quite hotel room. And if I had the laptop plugged into a power outlet I got a buzzing sound.The carrying case is slender and sturdy but it leaves no room to include an ipod.I returned them and will now order Audio Technica ATH-ANC7B."
2,Inferior Quality,"I liked the phone when I bought it. However, the contact between the wire and the headphone does not work well any more just after using the phone several times. Sometimes connected, sometimes not. It is very disturbing to hear the broken music. I had similar problem from Philips TV set. It seems Philips has quality problem."
4,Great Headphones,"A few points--Pros:removable audio cablevery comfortable on my head--Cons:Noise canceling does not reach higher frequenciesThe removable audio cable seems to be a bit weak, and I had to replace on my old pair once (they cost about $5)My previous pair of these headphones broke after 1 year, so I decided to get another pair. They seem very durable, as they were not well treated for that year. The noise canceling is not as good as the Bose headphones which I have used before, but considering how much cheaper these are, it was worth it. The noise canceling cancels out lower frequencies, but fails to cancel out higher frequencies. I recently took these on a plane trip, and found sleeping nearly impossible without these. They are nice because you can remove the audio cable, and just listen to noise cancellation. I would definitely recommencement these headphones to anyone."
3,Not very sturdy,"I've had my headphones for about 2 years and they've been falling apart for the past year. The headband engineering is a bit weak as it doesn't accommodate adjustments very well. There's a rotating joint where the cans join the headband that's come apart and there's a sliding band adjustment that doesn't stop sliding if you slide the band too far. You can work around the later problem by being *very* careful when you adjust the headband. The former problem can only be worked around by gluing the pieces together and hoping that you got the angle right when you freeze the pieces together.Sound quality is good and noise cancelling is fairly good. Not as effective as the Bose headphones but good enough.If they'd only designed the headband as well as they had the electronics, the headphones would be a good deal. If you don't mind having to replace them after a year or so, they're worth buying."
4,Philips Noise Canceling Headphones,"These headphones are great! They look and feel very high-end and expensive but carry a decent price tag. I love the extra features that you usually only find on more expensive sets such as the mute button, cool hard shell carrying case, and detachable cable. These are very comfortable and do a great job with noise cancellation without the annoying hissing sound. The only downside is the sound quality is a little on the normal side. I was hoping for some dynamic bass and clear trebles but it seems to lack the acoustic range I was hoping for. They still sound really good, but compared to the other positives you would think it would be a little better. Also, when you switch on the noise canceling feature the sound gets a little muffled. Overall, I would recommend these headphones to anyone looking for a mid-range pair of great quality for a lower price tag."
2,Philips SHN9500,Can't say I am too happy with these headphones. I prefer my previous pair (Sony MDR-NC6). I believe the noise cancelling feature was much better than Philips which at times not only sounds distorted but volume decreases when I turn the feature on. I will say the Philips is very comfortable and comes in a great hard case.
4,"Cheap, Good, and Confortable","I've been an owner of the Philips SHN950 Noise-Canceling Headphone for two weeks now. So far, I must say, I am very impressed. I live in a loud college dorm and for a math major that I am and with the nearest library almost half-mile away, my dorm room has been the only reasonable place to study. So far, I noticed that this headphone is able to drown out a lot of low-frequency noises. And I no longer had to deal with a loud neighbor that plays loud bass-based music all night. The music quality is acceptable. But for a 50 dollar headphone that's initial purpose is for noise-canceling, the sound quality is pretty good.The only con is that I can't really sleep with it on. I'm a side sleeper and there's just no way I can sleep with this headphone on.I would suggest this to a plane-traveler, mainly because of all the low-frequency sound on planes that drive people nuts.Great headphone though. Worth my money."
5,everything I hoped for,"I'm not a big audio-phile, but I can tell the difference between this and some of the cheaper headsets, and it was totally worth the extra money. These are comfortable and well made. I'd recommend anyone who uses headphones a lot to get these. The noise cancellation also works very well for me."
3,Good sound quality...but the noise canceling,"The sound quality is good, Comfort its also good , but the noise canceling it's a joke."
4,NOISE CANCELING HEADPHONE,THE PHILLIPS NOISE CANCELING HEADPHONE I PURCHASED IS A GREAT VALUE. THE HEADPHONES HAVE GREAT SOUND AT A WONDERFUL PRICE.I AM VERY PLEASED.
5,WORKS GREAT AROUND THE HOUSE!!,"This is an AMAZING product. I purchased them because while trying to listen to my classical music around the house, my wife kept NAGGING me to do the dishes or take out the trash. I kept telling her that these are part of her womanly duties and that I would have no part in this. Even after explaining this to her, she kept demanding that I do these chores. Since purchasing these headphones I can now enjoy my music and while I can see her mouth moving, I can not hear a word. These are god's gift to men everywhere. I strongly encourage you buy them!"
2,Ridiculous Packaging,"These headphones are small and comfortable. The noise reduction works well on low to mid frequencies. External conversations and music vocals still come through but at reduced volume, easily covered by your own music through the headphones.My biggest complaint is the ridiculous amount of packaging these come in. Basically a whole plastic and cardboard package within another super heavy duty plastic and cardboard package. And...also included is this ugly zipup hard shell covered with fabric case for your headphones. Who keeps their cheap-o headphones in a case? There must be thousands of these in landfills everywhere. In the end there is a total of 2-3 times the weight of the headphones in packaging and other garbage. Philips should be ashamed."
1,Very disappointing,I have a pair of Sennheiser PXC 250 earphone which are far superior. I also have a lower cost Altec Lansing noise cancellation earphones which I would also rate better than these Philips earphones. I may well return them to the them and get my money back.
5,AMAZING,"This is a great headphone. The sound quality is great, and the price is amazing. I got this when it was 32.45! so the entire order was 42. I bought it for my girlfriend so she can use it to study and enjoy her music. She loves it! she said that the noise in her living room (she has 2 younger loud siblings) we greatly reduced but not eliminated. I have just borrowed them for the weekend, and WOW they are amazing. Currently I am ordering them as of right now, even though the price is 20 dollars more than when i orginially got them, should have got 2 of them then. But it doesnt matter, for this high quality built, super comfy headphones with leather pads that feels like pillows, amazing sound with Noise cancelling , and decent working noise cancelling that corresponds to what was stated on the box 85%. I gotta say these are the best headphones i ever bought, and now I'm getting another for myself!"
4,Great Headphones For The Money,"I've used these headphones on several flights in the past month and I am impressed with their noise-canceling ability and comfort. I've tried the latest Bose headphones at an in-airport kiosk and was pleased with their noise-canceling as well, but couldn't justify spending that much on a pair of headphones. For less than a quarter of the price of the Bose headphones, these Philips deliver impressive noise cancellation and decent music quality (though the bass tends to be a little soft when noise-canceling is turned on). So if you're looking for a decent set of headphones to quiet your plane rides for not much money, I'd recommend these over the Bose any day."
4,Comfortable and Adequate,"They are comfortable to wear and do a decent job at canceling abient noise. But if one is expecting headphones that cancel all noise, these are not going to do the job."
5,Philips SHN9500 powered headphones,"This is an awesome product! Philips really means business when it comes to these headphones. I am able to study my classes on CD in a noisy room. All I do is activate the noise-cancelling option, and walah!! No noise! Great product for an unbelievable price."
2,Poor quality of construction,Do not buy these headphones if you have a larger sized head. The way the arms are constructed naturally leads to them breaking if you need to extend the phones and then significantly widen them for them to fit over your head.The steel band that goes over your head basically levers out the plastic casing that is supposed to hold it in and act as a brake on the phone extension.This is very disappointing since these phones are very comfortable and perform very well for the environment I want to use them in.
1,Do not work,"DOA. The noise canceling feature does not work, instead a loud static noise attempts to cover the ambient noise... a new concept.Philips does not manufacture them anymore, all I could get as a replacement was a different model, worth half what I paid for these ones."
4,Worth the Buy!,"After more than three years my headphones have finally bit the dust.These are probably the most comfortable headphones I have tried. They fit completely around the ears and provide the best sound quality for a great price.The only problem is that when I had them on, the sound was so good that I stood up and forgot they were on. The jack broke and I haven't been able to use them since.So if you buy these be warned that that you could be deceived into thinking that you're listening to your song/video through speakers!!!"
2,Broken after 10 months.,"This product was good in the beginning. Although battery life wasn't great, I have nothing to compare to. This is my first noise cancelling headphones. What I can't accept is that it only took 10 months for the noise cancelling to stop working (I can hear the ocean when its on!) and a couple of weeks later the left speaker's hinge gave up. It is hanging by the wires now.Now, I'm not a ""heavy duty"" user. The headphones rarely left my work cube in the past 10 months and I can't imagine what repeating strain they had to endure to fail so badly."
4,Great thing to have when you fly,These headphones made a trip across the Atlantic much more enjoyable. They cut ambient noise immensely but allow you to carry on a conversation with your seatmate. Only negative is the audio jack doesn't quite fit right sometimes. That requires a little jiggling to hook up to the airplane's audio/video channels.
1,Hard on the head!!,I puchased these about a year ago. This summer the hard plastic broke and they scratched my scalp badly. Definitely a consumer hazard.
2,Not noise cancelling,"These headphones' only claim to noise-cancelling capabilities are the ear-pieces (which are very comfortable by the way). I had bought these specifically for a long plane flight, and the noise-cancelling function made no difference re: the engine noise. Worse, when I plugged them into the in-flight entertainment unit, turning on the noise-cancelling function effectively muted the sound of the system! Turning it off, however, amplified the sound coming from it, so much so that I had the volume on minimum and still felt it was a bit too loud (good thing I wasn't watching an action flick). To top it all off, there was a malfunction with the battery operating the noise-cancelling function, so it would just turn off by itself because it couldn't detect the battery anymore. While the sound quality is good and it muffles some sound due to it's earpieces, this is no noise-cancelling headphone."
3,Of limited use to me...,"While this was the first pair of noise-canceling headphones I've had, I can't comment on how well it does that in comparison to anything. I must say, they seemed to accomplish that task okay... although I was expecting something a little more dramatic. The build quality was pretty solid, although the headphones seemed a little ""hard"" (i.e. slightly heavy and uncomfortable). What really peeved me is that the cord is so short and there's no volume adjust. I've read another review here that mentioned the volume adjust being ""on-cord"" but I've looked through my package thoroughly and unless there was a different cord that was removed/replaced at the factory, my Costco-bought headphones came only with the lamo cord I mention. That's enough to make this unit pretty much worthless to me."
2,Noise-Canceling?,"I do like the audio fidelity of these headphones. I had high hopes for much better noise-canceling ability. They do reduce the noise some, but not nearly as much as my cheap, passive, ""drum phones"". Though my drum phones have less fidelity, I'll be wearing them when I mow the lawn. And I'll be wearing the very comfortable Philips at the office."
2,If you like to hear bass these aren't the earphones for you....,"The earphones were ok. The noise cancelling was good but the sound of my music wasn't so great in these headphones. Before I had ear buds by Sony which were great but when I workout they tend to slip out. I thought getting these would be better plus cancel out all of the noise around. They actually were worse than my Sony ear buds. If you are someone that doesn't care about the sound of music and mainly need it for travel, it would be great for you. I just expected more out of them."
2,phillips noise canceling makes music sound worse,"these headphones are very comfortable and when not listening to my ipod, they cancel noise reasonably well (~70%). BUT when listening to music, turn off the noise canceling feature - your music ears will appreciate it."
4,"Pretty good, so far.","I like these much better than the Sony noise-canceling headphones I bought about 2 years ago. The Sony model created an uncomfortable feeling of pressure on my eardrums. Noise was reduced, but the noise-canceling was uncomfortable for long periods and made me worry that it was going to damage my hearing.These Philips headphones do not create that sensation, and the noise-canceling works well enough. Unfortunately, I started getting a very high-pitched sound in the right-headphone today that varies in tone, especially if I tap on that side. It sort of sounds like the whine you get when tuning an AM radio. It seems to come and go, but it might just go beyond my range of hearing. If it continues, I'll try trading them in for a new pair to see if it's just a defective unit. So far it seems to only happen when connected to my iPod with the noise canceling turned on."
5,Cisco wireless security at its best,"Wireless and security go hand-in-hand. Enabling wireless without implementing security is a disservice to your client; it makes them totally vulnerable to intrusion.This book gives you the technical capabilities and knowledge to understand what it takes to implement current (2004-2005) security techniques in your Cisco Aironet wireless environment. It includes detailed information, including sample IOS configurations, about Cisco wireless security and intrusion prevention. The book flows well from chapter to chapter and builds upon previous topics. The authors discuss Cisco SWAN (Structured Wireless Aware Networks) in depth and then offer several enterprise wireless deployment scenarios.All-in-all, a very well-written technical manual that I highly recommend for WLAN engineers implementing Cisco Aironet solutions.This book was written before the Airespace acquisition and does not cover that architecture."
2,Who read this?,"I bought this book based on the synopsis and the many 5-star customer reviews. All I can say is that it appears that most of the reviewers are either loyal followers of the authors and/or don't read much else. The writing is simply awful. Stilted dialog and unimaginative descriptive narrative abounds. There are missing words, awkward phrases and incomplete sentences througout. Honestly, I read a lot of fanfiction and many of those amateur writers are better. The only reason I don't give it one star is because the storyline has some originality. Too bad it was so poorly executed."
2,Not bad,"I read this book after reading ""The Kingdom and the Crown"" trilogy by Gerald N. Lund and I thought it was an incomplete repetition of those books. Whereas I completely fell in love with ""The Kingdom and the Crown"", I found ""First Light"" boring and hard to read. I personally don't recommend this book."
1,Overpriced,Love the hardback books but these kindle prices are outrageous! Very disappointed in this $24.99 price. I might as well buy it brand new in the store. This has got to be the authors. Are they greedy or what?
5,"Refreshing, intriguing, riveting read","Simply put, this book took me to a time and a place that I couldn't wait to go back to. All in all it was an encouraging and educational escape. ~steveT"
4,"First Light, First Rate",This audio book is very well done. The authors bring the story of the beginning of Christianity alive with characters you can really care about. You get a better understanding of how difficult life was for the common men and women of Judea at this time of Roman occupation.
5,Great book,"This book is the start of one of the most amazing series I have ever read. Brock and Bodie Thoene have an unbelievable talent of making history come alive. When they apply that talent to the time of Jesus, the gospels come alive while staying true to the scriptures. You will never regret reading this series!"
5,Brilliant,This book is amazing! You will travel back in time to the most pivital period in history. The character development is outstanding and the facts right on. This series is a must read. You will learn as well as enjoy this fantastic book. Even though this time period is long gone you can still see and feel its impact today!! Well done Thoene's!! Kerrin
5,Great story,What can words say for books written by the Thoene's? I have not read any Christian books until these and I find that these are the best! They enlighten you on the life and times of Jews in Israel in the first century.
5,First Light,Book arrived quickly and in shape described. I am very satisfied with the seller. Thanks.
1,I am so tired of receiving books without jackets!,Why can't you be more clear in description if a book doesn't come with a jacket. I am buying for a library and NEED the jacket.
4,Nothing tricky here!,The description of this CD clearly states that the artists are Bing Crosby et al. And that's what it is... Nothing deceptive at all. A fun CD that demonstrates a variety of styles from another era.
4,Very Good Player,"I already had a DVD player for my computer and it performed really well, however I wanted something for my home entertainment system. This product delivered. It surpassed any picture quality that I have seen so far--only to be rivaled by movie theaters. The menus and options will take a little practice to get used to, however, the remote control comes in handy with its navigation buttons. Sound is definitely great on this player, when good speakers are attached to the player. Overall, this is an excellent buy."
1,Dont bother,We bought this item and returned it the very next day.We used the older (round bucket)rival that belongs to a friend with no problem but this oval shaped rival was useless to us. The salt and ice didn't have enough room to surround the bucket. the motor kept coming unattached from the bucket or would stop turning completely. It never made ice cream. We just figured we got what we paid for and bought a more expensive Cuisinart ice cream maker and have had wonderful results thus far
4,Rival Electric Ice Cream Maker,Used over the holidays and had no problem making the ice cream. One of the recipes included was very good.
3,oval shape is inefficient,"Freezing time takes longer because the oval shape does not allow ice to be placed EVENLY around can. If shape of ice maker was ROUND, sufficient ice would be able to placed around entire can and freezing time would be less.Motor did work well and instruction stating that if can stops turning prematurely then add water to bottom of maker was helpful."
1,"DO NOT BOTHER! PAY MORE, PLEASE!!!","We were so excited to receive our ice cream maker. But it looks much more sturdy in the picture than it actually is; it is actually very flimsy. We have made ice cream before so we know we were not doing anything ""wrong;"" BUT...After 1-1/2 hours, we still had nothing more than mush....after adding ice, adding water, adding salt, ad infinitum. Pay the extra $40 or $50 to get a good one....we just wasted every cent on this one. We may give it one more try, but after that disappointing episode, I kind of doubt it. We still have the box so we may check into sending it back, but I am not sure if this seller makes refunds and it will be more cost to shipping than it is worth, in all probability.Also, it took longer to receive than anticipated."
1,What was rival thinking????,"We bought the pink version of this machine as we wanted a second ice cream maker to use at a family gathering. What a huge mistake. The oval design has several HUGE issues. First and foremost, the ice gets jammed between the side wall and brings the machine to a halt and container so you litterly have to crush the ice to even get it to work. Second, after you have gone to all the trouble to crush the ice small enough, the motor doesn't latch on well so on occassion it will come loose while it is running. Third, because of the oval design, it seems to lack adequate ice capacity to cool and freeze the ice cream efficiently. Our old ice creem maker can make two batches of ice cream in the time it took this piece of junk to make one. Not sure what rival engineers were thinking when they created this, but clearly their focus was NOT on making ice cream."
1,Not worth the headache,I wish I could give it - stars.This is a piece of junk. The oval design is horrible. I had to crush ice fine just to make it work.The lock is so flimsy that it would jump out of place and I would have to hurry try to place it back in correctly.I finally gave up and tried to salvage what I could of the VERY soft ice cream.I PROMISE you it is not worth the money you spend for it....even if it's only five bucks.This only is going back to the store. I have learn my lesson. I will be spending the money on a good qualityice cream freezer. Since the store is 1 hour away and the ice cream ruined this was an expensive experiment.:(Be warned.... Do NOT buy!
2,"A word of advice for people who have never owned an ""ice cream maker"".","We had never purchased an ice cream maker. Our mistake. We purchases a Rival 6 Quart Ice Cream Maker.We were surprised to find out by reading the instruction manual that we had to mix the ice cream (with large amounts of costly ingredients like whipping cream and half and half) separately, then refrigerate mixture for half an hour or more, finally place it in the ""ice cream maker"", let it mix there for 40 minutes, and lastly, place it in the freezer for a few hours. I guess we were foolish to believe it would make ice cream, not just mix it for a while."
1,Not sturdy,"I have used this ice cream maker for 3 years and have made approximately a dozen batches of ice cream with it. As I was cleaning the machine tonight the center of the bottom of the metal cylinder, in which you actually make the ice cream, came out! I now have a 1.75 inch diameter hole in the center of this thing. I certainly will not be buying this item to replace it."
3,great!,We bought this ice cream maker during the summer when no other ice cream makers were being sold. we were really happy with the maker other then the fact that if you used rock salt it would throw the whole maker around and your ice cream didnt get made. We have had to use ice and then use regular table salt with it. other then that this was a good deal and works just fine.
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun!","This was exactly what we needed to make the healthy, homemade icecream at home. The instructions were easy to follow and even included some recipes - the vanilla ice cream recipe is good! It is plastic but it hold up well."
1,Bad item,"I purchased this ice cream freezer. It locks down about 3 minutes into the freezing and the motor will not stay locked on the top of the bucket. I have had issues with this machine since I got it. I would not recommend this model. I believe that part of the problem is the design of the unit. I will be searching for another round, bucket style freezer."
1,A flimsy plastic container makes this a disposable item.,After only one use the flimsy plastic container cracked and is no longer usable. Not at all the quality of my former Rival Ice Cream Makes!
1,Don't use rock salt with this one,I've only owned Rival and White Mountain ice cream makers for the past 21 years. This Rival 6 quart and the similar Rival 4 quart are not consistent when making ice cream. Sometimes they work fine and sometimes not. I'm unsure why not except for when I use rock salt. The rock salt is too large to fit between the sidewall of the bucket and the freezer cannister itself. We have had several times where the rock salt stops the freezer completely in the first couple of minutes because the opening in the oblong bucket is too narrow to permit the salt to move past.
4,6 quarts!,"comes with a recipe book to make either 6 quarts, 5 quarts or 4 quarts and within about an hour, you've got homemade ice cream. the ice cream container has a lid to store the remaining (if there is any) in your freezer, but if all you have is the freezer above your refrigerator, you'll need another container because this one is too big."
1,Quit after three uses.,"On the third use the gears inside the motor stripped out, rendering the ice cream maker useless. I've been making ice cream for a long time and the last freezer I owned lasted ten years or more. I've never had anything this low quality. Label said ""made in China"" so the low quality didn't surprise me. Given other ratings I may have pruchased a lemon, but I won't buy another one."
5,GREAT ICE CREAM MAKER,"This machine is a great little ice cream maker.. Its not that big (for a 6qt maker), like the bigger round ones, but it sure makes the ice cream.. GREAT purchase and great price.."
4,"Good item, good price.","I've really enjoyed this product. I was worried when I first purchased it over a year ago that it might a little too cheap quality-wise but figured since the price was cheap too, it was worth the risk. It certainly was worth it. I have made countles batches of fantastic ice cream without a problem yet."
4,Good ice cream maker,Ice cream maker worked pretty well. It was hard to get the ice down to the bottom of the tub. I will work harder at it next time.
2,WEAK MOTOR,"VERY NICE LOOKING ICE CREAM MAKER, BUT A BAD DESIGN AND THE MOTOR DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH TORQUE. IT WAS CONSTANTLY STALLING AS ICE WOULD GET CAUGHT BETWEEN THE HOUSING AND THE ICE CREAM TANK. COULD BE SOLVED BY SIMPLY MAKING THE HOUSING CONCENTRIC WITH THE TANK SO THAT ICE CAN MOVE FREELY. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS PRODUCT."
4,very good ice cream,"Makes very good ice cream, but not particularly in love with the shape. The oval shape doesn't lend to the ice surrounding the container, making the process shorter."
4,No worries so far,"Has worked great through half a dozen large batches of ice cream so far. Six quart capacity is nice. Plastic ice bucket is light, leak free, and easy to clean - but has zero insulation properties so ice does melt rather quickly. Definitely can't be described as whisper quiet, but on the plus side you can tell when it stops from another room. Can't go wrong for the price."
2,Takes too long,"I haven't had much success with this ice cream maker. I usually give up after 2 hours of churning, and the mixture is far from ice cream at that point. I usually have to throw it all in my freezer to get it to solidify into something resembling ice cream. I saw in another review that it has taken another user 2.5-4 hrs to make ice cream. That's way too long...seems like the old hand crank ice cream maker my parents used to use was a lot quicker."
2,Motor too small,The motor isn't powerful enough. The ice cream starts freezing to the outside edge of the container causing the motor to quit when the bulk of the ice cream is still liquid.
3,Studying the G.E.D.,I just want to said I had my first exprenice with using the materials from the Pass The G.E.D Book. I am using it to help assist others study for their G.E.D. The reason I am give this a rating of 3 stars is because the colors in the book to do copy good when you want to copy pages from it. The picture draft do not show clear after you make a copy.
5,Excellent audio rendering of Larkin's poetry.,"Larkin's poetry captures the melancholy, timelessness, and small dramas of everyday experience, and The Whitsun Weddings contains some of his best work (the title poem, Sunny Prestatyn, Dockerey and Son, for example). Alan Bennet's reading captures precisely the feeling of these poems. His careful, restrained inflections and changes of voice heighten Larkin's subtle effects and let each poem's feeling come in a natural and unforced way. A delightful tape from beginnning to end."
5,nanbrit,"The breakfast cups and saucers are larger than the average tea-cup roughly twice the capacity which is perfect for a start of the day ""cuppa"" and much nicer than using mugs. A very good addition for anyone with other Portmeirion dishes."
2,The title used as a mantra is better than the read itself....,A boring read. Does not really get to stage freight problems in my estimation. Too much discussion before getting to the meat & potatoes of it all.....
3,Had high hopes for this one,"I had high hopes for this book. The title is a powerful anti-anxiety technique. It all starts with feeling the fear...and not letting it stop you and doing it anyway. That's the true solution to anxiety.But the book explains it in such a complex way, that I didn't really like it in the end."
1,"Read the book, did not respect the opinions offered in it","I read the book, and found it very opinionated, and less factual. I wasn't about to put a comment about this bad book here, until I found out others were outraged. I highly recommend to look elsewhere for reading material, that is, [...]."
1,Did nothing for me,"An over-simplistic approach - the title says it all. The author doesn't help you or tell you how to overcome your fears - she just keeps telling you ""you can do it"". She also refers to herself too often as her primary topic of research without taking into account that just because something worked for her it is not necessarily universal."
1,Poorly organized and uninformative self-help book,"A poorly put together book with limited ability to actually help someone who requires concrete ideas and facts to bolster their understanding and knowledge of a situation in order to help. The authors delves too much into the metaphysical, pseudo-science, faith-based world and fails to flesh out the more interesting details.The book comes off as superficial and incapable of helping someone who is not faith-based. The author attempts to coin awkward phrases to explain otherwise helpful intuitive concepts. There are better self-help books that actually teach as opposed to coddle the reader with benign phrases and ideas."
1,"Important topic, awful book","This is a vital topic in our fear-mongering society - overcoming fear to accomplish our goals. It is unfortunate that this book does not live up to its premise, [...]. It may be frightening to avoid buying this book, but you should feel the fear... and do it anyway."
5,Personal Growth Must Read,"I read this book when it first came out 20 years ago and now, with updated material, it's still the most wonderful resource on courage. I ordered four copies--one for me and a copy for each of my sisters. Do yourself a huge favor if you're looking for a shift in courage and hope and get this book!"
4,Helpful little book,"This book was recommended to me by a career counselor who was assisting me in the job search. The book has some helpful and important ideas concerning overcoming fear and getting things accomplished. Well-written, easy-to-read style. Not every chapter will be relevant to your situation perhaps, but at least the main message will be. Of course if you buy it based on the title, because you have trouble overcoming some fear, then it will be worth the purchase price."
4,Feel the Fear and do it anyway,I love this book. It's a step by step journey to stop being blocked by fear and live the life you were meant to live. One of the most powerful points in the book for me was that everyone feels fear. When you walk into a situation that makes you uncomfortable don't assume that everyone else isn't afraid along with you. Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway is a call to change yourself and start living.
5,"Inspirational, encouraging and so TRUE!!!","Susan Jeffers has touched many people with her no nonsense, reality books. No one is going to make progress if they stay in a comfort zone in life. Learning to walk wasn't easy, and we must have been afraid of doing that at one time, but look at us now!!! I have conquered many fears over the years thanks to the suggestions in her books, and today I find myself in a place I want to be! Thank you Susan.........so bad experiences really do make us ask ourselves ""What can I learn from this"" !!!! Bless you, and carry on with the good work.....Onwards and Upwards!!!"
5,Personal Growth,"I ordered this book on the suggestion of a friend from Italy. I really haven't had time to get into it as yet, but from what I've read it is just exactly what I was interested in."
5,Excellent resource for improving your life,"I am a clinical social worker and have recommended this book to countless clients. It is an excellent introduction to cognitive-behavioral techniques and is helpful in dealing with a wide range of issues, from a breakup of a relationship to a job change to general self-esteem improvement. I especially like the exercises that give the reader an opportunity to try out the theories and apply them to everyday life. Some of her phrases (like ""chatterbox"") are corny and she repeats them too often, but try to look past it. The content is worth it."
5,"Yeah, Susan. Yeah!","Everyone else was too afraid to review the cassette of Susan Jeffers Ph.D. reading a condensed version of her splenetic book, Feel the fear... (etc). I haven't touched the book. But on the tape she's sweet but harsh and really hits it home that you've got to face this thing....and I've known it all along, but she paints it so clearly, that this stuff's all going on in your head, and it's only a game. But she paints it SO clearly, so clearly...Everybody. Listen to this. (Or read the book)Fear is fun. It's like a drug--pushes you on, feel that slimy up your spine as you push the limits, and just keep repeating [it's only a game][it's only a game]"
5,A healing book.,"This book gives important advice and strategies on how to fightdefeatist thought patterns, especially fear, that usually hindershuman endeavours or even normal life.I highly recommend this book if and only if you are serious aboutdoing all the exercises. If you can do that, you are guaranteedto deal effectively with your fear."
5,How are you being?,"So much about achieving anything worthwhile isn't just about ""doing."" It's also about ""being"" -- the understanding of where we are now, the sensing of ourselves in the moment. This is probably the toughest thing to understand when moving forward on a goal. On the other side of fear is exhilaration, great power. Once we get this concept of ""feeling the fear,"" and sense it deep within our bones, the transformation can be spectacular as we rise to battle and defeat a most scary foe. So what's the downside of feeling the fear? Absolutely nothing. It's a good thing. It helps us know when we are most aware and whether we're on track. Like sadness and pain, it's an integral part of a well-lived life."
4,"May work for some, but here;s the catch","Sometimes, it DOES help to know how and why you have a fear and the right therapist (it can take time to find the right one) can help lend insight that relieves anxiety. Understanding that one is not ""crazy"" or ""weird"" for having certain fears and that they may actually have started for some pretty good reasons (at one time) but the precipitating factors may no longer be there.For other people, this book may be all they need - if they have the courage to keep going in spite of massive anxiety attacks, pounding hearts, etc. Ever try to convince a person who is hyperventilating that he or she is not dying or having a heart attack? Ever try to get an agoraphobic to leave their safe space and venture outside?Reading this book may help give insight and a great pep talk to those who live in fear and anxiety but the real work starts when the book is put down. The ultimate courage is up to the reader."
2,Well... here goes....,I have crippling social anxiety that prevents me from telling people how I feel....I can't do this...
3,Worth reading but not a 5 star,"This is perhaps not my most favorite book but it does tackle the subject of Fear and how paralyzing it can be. There is no doubt that the only way to overcome any fear is to face it and deal with it. Not easy to do, but fear will be a factor in moving forward for many of us, as we move out of our comfort zones and into our new ventures."
4,Worth the Read,While not seismic it is helpful. There are many not so self-evident truths that I found very useful. It is worth reading.
3,Conquer fear or fear will conquer you.,Fear is the crippling emotion that has caused many people to not achieve their potential. This book discussed how eventhough you may have fear you must still continue to move forward.
1,Feel the Terrible and Read it Anyway,"I knew after reading the reviews, this book was going to be terrible, but for some reason, I decided to read it anyway.Hated it, worst book I have ever read."
1,Feel the Fear and Don't Do it,Lame book.I returned it and got my money back.Would have settled for half!
1,Terrible...Just Terrible,"I bought this book because it seemed like something my mother would be into. Decided I would read it first. The author is seriously out of touch the the world and reality at large, not to mention the English language and the rule of law. I returned this book the next day. I would recommend you find yourself another self-help book,"
1,Condescending Tone of Book,This book takes the turn that all self help books should avoid. It is condescending and talks down to the readers.
1,Disappointing,"For those who buy into the current American new agey affirmation laden culture, this book is great. Buy it, read it, and it may help you.For those who question, think deeply, and are introspective try the more compassionate and realistic _Fear Book_ by Cheri Huber."
4,Simple Advice That You Can Relate To,"I must admit I have been reading this book for about 3 months now. That is my only complaint. It's easy to put down and not pick up again but once you do you can completely relate to the ideas of the book and see the pitfalls and results of ""Feeling the fear and not doing it"" in your own life.Dr. Jeffers reminds us that fear is a part of growth and guess what, if you are feeling it you aren't growing. She also points out that when faced with a difficult decision the is no losing choice. The power to always make your choice a winner lies in yourself. I found this point particularly empowering and have since used this new found knowledge in my decision making process.Overall a book that can be applied to your life with positive results at the end of each chapter.Danielle Millar, Glenn Simon Inc."
5,Realistic and Usable,"Just understanding what fear is has made a significant change in my daily life. It's short, easy to read, and applicable to everyday life. Dr. Jeffers is also very personable and well-spoken. I recommend the unabridged book on tape."
5,Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway,What a great book full of insight material. The best thing is to buy this book with the intent of constantly reviewing and usingthe material contained within its pages. Now I know why a lot of fears persist. Not your usual motivational hyperbole. Thank youSusan Jeffers
2,A not-so-good shopping experience.,"It took 4 weeks for me to get my purchase! I emailed the company several times and while they offered to refund my money and expedite me another copy if mine hadnt arrived in a timely fashion, I have yet to see my refund and they were more concerned with me removing a mediocre review than anything else. Their public response to my last review was ""Wish she had let me know, I would have been happy to help."", which was absurd because I contacted them SEVERAL times and voiced my displeasure. I will definately not be ordering from them again."
5,"IF YOU READ ONLY ONE SELF HELP BOOK, THIS SHOULD BE THE ONE!",This book really gets at the heart of self-empowerment. It will change your life. Guaranteed.
1,Dont try it,"A bland and overly generic book, just a repeat of ideas I've heard many times. Looks like the author just took a bunch of ideas that have been around forever and decided to write them down as if they were her own."
1,Rubbish,"Horrible! A friend of mine was reading this book to try and over come their fear of heights. They weren't sure if the book actually made sense, but continued reading it because it was written by a Ph.D. Unfortunately, that degree only gave false credit to a poorly written and pseudoscience work of fiction. Do not buy!"
1,Waste of time and money,"There is nothing new or creative about this book. Its is a repetition of many common ideas. I regret the time, and money, I wasted with this irrelevant work."
1,Quite possibly the biggest waste of time and money.,"To put it bluntly, this book is the worst thing I have ever read. It was absolutely nothing but a waste of time and money. To prevent someone else from reading it, I'm burning it the next camp fire we have."
1,I did it anyway,This book was about as valuable as those horoscope scrolls you used to see at the grocery store. The only fear I have is that I won't be able to sell this book and recoup a single dollar of its cost.
1,Worst book I have read in years.,"I have read many books in the past, but arguably this has to be one of the worst. As I was reading through the book, I did not understand what the author was trying to argue. Do yourself a favor and purchase a different book."
1,The author is out of touch with reality,"The ideas and arguments presented in the book are completely idiotic and the author doesn't seem to have a grasp of reality. While this book makes out on the outside of the cover that it will give you courage in your life. It is a bunch of pop phrases she has make up that have silly meanings and after reading this book I feel the money would have been better spent elsewhere. Bottom line this book sucks, probably the worst book I have ever read (and I read 4 -6 books per month). Give this one a miss."
3,I wish it was on Kindle,"This book is a quick read, and very basic. The entire book can be summed up in the title. Sometimes we need to hear what we already know."
1,Sorely disappointed,"As a woman who's dealt with anxiety for decades, I was sorely disappointed in this book. I'm always on the lookout for useful NEW ways to get a handle on anxiety, this book was merely another repeat of what's already out there-and has been proven not to work. Coming from a doctor, which now seems a stretch in itself, I expected more."
2,Twinkie,"I found the book quite superficial and unrealistic. It has some good insights but to say you can just overcome deep emotional problems by recognizing them and using affirmations is a bit idealistic. Also, some of the suggestions are downright twinkie! My 2 cents worth..."
5,Motivating! Get moving!,"This is a five star motivating book! I was impressed with the writing and the skill the author offered to anyone needing a little extra push or a heavy duty push to get moving, face your fears and begin to do what you enjoy and what needs to be done!I have a notebook full of tips and inspiration on taking that first step and continuing to create the rich and fulfilling life you deserve. Great book and a keeper to refer to throughout your life!"
1,Useless,"Understanding for fear does not help to overcome them! I know exactly what is wrong with me but that still didn't help. You just have to jump in the fire and get burned, no book can help you."
1,Not worth your time or money,"Just read the first few chapters and what a waste of paper! I'm going through some hard times and bought this book to help give me courage and strength, but I found it totally useless. Everything she says is obvious, she offers no insights your 5 year-old couldn't come up with. Save your time and money and look elsewhere for help![...]."
1,Very Disapointing,"I don't understand. Why do I see this book recommended by so many respectable professionals? It is really terrible. I waited and waited for something useful to be given but it never came. I mean, the premise was good, the argument that you must do what you fear to increase your power and decrease your pain. The rest of the book, however, gives no useful ideas on HOW to do what you fear. What? Think positive? That's not helpful! We've heard these things in hundreds of other books. She needs to get a lot deeper than that to offer any real substance."
5,This book just continues to help me every day.,"When we are reading and the words in front of us reflect our very thoughts and feelings, we must come to face the fact that the author is right on about something. This author taught me how to overcome a myriad of fears I hadn't even recognized I had until they were there on the page. I read it probably over a year ago, yet I still say the phrase whenever I need to: Feel the fear and do it anyway. One of the best self help books around."
5,Words That Ring True,"I started this audio tape with a bit of ""I heard it before"". However, Susan Jeffers presents the concept of making life change with excellent examples and a matter of fact style. By the 3rd cassette, I realized that I was stuck and missing out on a life because I was taking things to seriously and was following the plan too closely. I am the person who perseveres until I get the outcome I was looking for. If I can't see the outcome before I start, I won't even consider taking the risk. Susan helped me to see things in a different light. I always believe that gifts come to you at the right time in your life when you're willing to take the lesson. I found Feel the Fear at the perfect moment for me."
1,Just Terrible,I read this book throughly and felt nothing different about my fears. This book is completely uninspired.
1,No good,I read the entire book and it was no good. No good at all. I don't see how anybody could enjoy this.
1,Horrible excuse for literature.,I do not understand how anyone could find this book remotely helpful. This book is pure trash. I have no respect for this author's writing. Reading this book was like an odious task. I would not recommend this book. It makes me feel the need to become an hero.
1,Very generic advice.,"A lot of what's in this book is very generic advice from the perspective of one person. You are much better off finding books that pertain to the area of life you are having problems with... ie health, romance, personal friendships."
1,Feel the fear and do it anyway,"check it out, this book was so trite and useless that I actually recieved more help from a homeless man that I had given a nickle to. He was more helpful than this book and when I tried to offer it to him, he balked and spat at my feet as if I had insulted by my precieved gesture of kindness. Nonetheless I fell disheartened from this exchange and felt the need to tell the savy consumers of Amazon that this book will only be useful if you enjoy reading regurgitated common ideas. [...]"
5,Life changing!,"I read this book, after some major events in my life and I was facing scarcity. This book help me to find courage within me, and to know everything will be ok. It help me to make a quantum leap in my life and reconnect with who I am.If you face adversity or challenges in your life, if you are undecided about a direction to take, or simply want to play bigger in your life, this book will help you to do what success people are willing to do to achieve their dreams."
1,Buy it if you want to waste your money,Usually I won't review anything I don't like but here this book is so bad I had to write something about it. It's just a re hash of the same self help book clichés ideas - nothing new here only the same old boring stuff. I had to bury this book deep - I don't want anyone else to come across this. feel the fear and do it anyway? ORLY?
2,Not a must have book...,"It seems too strange to see those raving possitive reviews,After reading over 100 self help books and 3 books related to overcomming fear. I think this book is very simple and does not really have anything powerful insights.For example if you want to do some affirmations everyday or hype yourself up that you can ""do it anyway""... than this book is for you.I personally recomend the ""sedona"" book. it will set you free and let you deal with fear in a much more unique and effective way."
2,Warning - voice used in audio can be irritating,"My rating is specifically directed at the ""audio"" version of this book. The narrator's voice is not very pleasing to listen to and can become in fact a little distracting. Rather than listening to a clear professional voice, there's a nasal quality to it and a bit of a lisp. You hear a lot of her tongue, swallowing & spit in her mouth...a bit gross. If you don't need the audio version and you are sensitive to these types of sounds (it can over time become as irritating as listening to someone who makes tons of slurping noises while eating), I recommend you read the paperback book version instead."
4,Life changing. And I wasn't even into 'self help' books!,"This book gave me the courage to abandon my human resources career, into which I'd poured massive effort. I cashed in my superannuation to fund a year of creativity. I then became a copywriter and have not once regretted my decision."
1,Awful book,"This is a terrible book. I borrowed it from my mom and managed to get through half of it before I whipped it against a wall - it's cliched, new-agey, general, and unoriginal. Don't buy this book!"
5,Helpful!,"Now I know why I've heard this book recommended by so many friends! I am so glad I finally took the time to read it. I also know why my friends didn't give me their copies, it is worth a re-read! I can already tell this will be a friend I will refer to over time.It is comforting and motivating at the same time.I appreciate Dr. Jeffer's warmth during times of such scorn and cynicism. It's refreshing.I highly recommend! And for perspective, I am a happily married woman with a great job. I just wanted a little push. That's what I got.I've done my research, Dr. Jeffers has been married for over 20 years and actually has a life that works. I'll take advise and wisdom from her!"
4,Not too shabby !!,"The P-40 is my favorite bird, and this part is a good bit of WW II, on the ground training footage, with quite a bit of cockpit operation detail. Aside from the Nationalistic ""Hero corn"" , ("" With planes like these, and men like these....(think white scarf blowing in the breeze out of the open canopy), it is good, and quite detailed on the controls. P-40 part mostly B&W. The P-38 part is also military film, but in color, and has some really good footage in the air, also cockpit training with emergency stuff. All in all, if you like these planes, you should like this tape !!"
5,"Great watch, Subtle yet Stylish.",Subtle yet stylish watch. My favorite three features:1- Coaxial movement2- See thru back3- GMTThe Bond watch does not have the GMT. GMT comes super handy if you are a frequent international traveller or if you deal with people in another continent on a regular basis.It's sturdy watch.. solid and heavy. Don't buy this if your idea of comfort is a Skagen :-)
1,mem card worked great... for a while,"ive had a sony ps2 mem card for three years now that still works great. i bought this card, rather, got it for a gift, about a year ago. well now it has begun to corrupt my game files and it wont erase them and i cant save anthing or load anything from it. DO NOT buy this product, by a sony card they work great."
3,not to great,the same as the Sony brand. has you to loose your memory. on my one max the whole thing is blank. one thing i really do not like about Sony memory cards can delete the memory or something. i got like 2 of these can not really use.
1,"Failed RAM sucks! This isn't a game Amazon, it's RAM! : (",RAM failed!I am unable to access memory via browser.Memory should never do this.2 buns down
1,Unhappy with this,"I bought this yesterday from our local Toys R Us after reading about others' negative experiences in trying to get it from Amazon, and I'm really disappointed so far, because my PS2 won't recognize it. It's frustrating, to say the least. And now that I've opened it, I'm sure that TRU probably won't take it back. Waste of money."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!,"Not only does this memory card function extremely slow (writing and reading), I cannot even begin to count how many game saves have gone corrupt on this card. I have 4 other Sony 8MB cards that I have yet (in 4 years) to see a single corrupt (blue square icon of death symbol) file. However, with this card from Datel, I have had many many game saves go corrupt. The most recent and back breaking being 42 hours into okami and the entire save lost. Some others have been MGS2, MGS3, Tekken (multiple), various network config files, etc, etc. Don't be a cheapskate and jump at this deal. It sounded too good to be true when I bought this card, and it was!!!! Save yourself some ulcers and don't buy this card. I am now boycotting all things DATEL unless they were to magically send me my dozens of game saves they lost!!!!!"
1,Don't Buy,Don't buy! My memory wen't corrupt and now I can't load or save anything!Buy Sony's brand it is better. I'm never buying from Max Memory again!
1,ONLY HOLDS 2 MB!!,"This card isn't worth crap. I bought one at Walmart and after a few days, I had only saved about 2 MB worth of files on it and it kept saying save failed. It acted like it was full even though it said 14 MB of free space. So I returned it, thinking I had a defective unit, and bought another. It did the same exact thing! Don't waste your money on this."
5,Excellent Product.,"This works just as great as the Sony Memory card that we have, but it was a lot cheaper. Definately a great buy."
1,AMAZON WASTED MY TIME,"Apparently reviewer M.Twain is correct about Amazon pulling a fast one. Either that, or they're just incompetent. The ""usually ships within 24 hours"" statement is obviously false. Below is the shipping information e-mailed to me by Amazon for an order entered on November 15, 2005. I'm canceling it.--------------------------------------------------Shipping estimate for these items: January 15, 2006Delivery estimate: January 19, 2006 - January 21, 20061 ""DATEL 32MB Max Memory Card for Playstation 2""CD-ROM; $22.99"
1,I should have read the other reviews before ordering,"I ordered this product last night (November 28, 05)....Noting as others have that the description includes ""Usually ships within 24 hours"". The order confirmation now says the shipping date is expected February 06. I ordered 2 other non-related items at the same time, and hopefully this isn't holding up everything. I'm giving this a one star since it seems to be an ongoing problem."
2,Extreme Hastle,"The 32MB capacity of this card is a great value compared to the standard PS2 memory cards. However, this is completely outweighed by the inconvenience of having to load a cd to initialize the card every time you wish to use it. I now only use it to store game data that I don't use regularly and have reverted to a standard card for day-to-day use. (Rating would be a 5/5 if initialization wasn't necessary)."
1,"Be aware, these don't seem to work with new PS2","We have had some problems with these memory cards not being very user friendly. You have to use an installation CD everytime you want to use the cards. But the biggest problem is that we just purchased the new PS2 and we cannot get them to work at all. I just opened a brand new one that I had not used previously, but had purchase last Christmas and it does not work either and of course, now, even though I still have all the packaging, receipt and everything since I just opened it, Best Buy won't take it back, exchange it, nothing... I just wasted almost $20 on that one and now the other two we had been using are useless also. What a way to burn money. I wouldn't advise anyone to purchase these memory cards."
1,please dont waste your $$$,"we had this memory card for 6 monthes and now it just doesnt work anymore. can't believe how unbelievable crappy this thing is put together. dont be fooled, just because its 16 mb not 8 like sony's doesnt mean its a better bargain. now im here on amazon to buy another memory card, a sony 8mb."
5,HP Projector lamp L1809A,Thank you for the original product sent to me. It was installed and is working very well.I am very satisfied with the service of Amazon.comAll the bestk j jose
3,A1's lead singer makes his solo debut.,"Ben Adams steps out away from is band A1 with his solo debut ""sorry"" I think it's a great tune, however I don't know if it will be strong enough to support buying an entire cd, but I am curious to hear more from Ben. This is an upbeat pop tune in the vein of Kelly Clarkston's current slew of hit singles or even A1's ""caught in the middle"" tune, it's pop with a bit of an edge."
3,Great music....but skips,"I purchased this CD....all the songs are great. However, when I got to the 2nd CD the music started skipping so I had to return. It is the best and still even when Waylon Jennings is gone, his music still lives on. Right on...Waylon. God Bless you."
1,a living nightmare,the book was in real bad shape for them advertising it as good for a used book .i really was dissapointed with it.
5,Colonial American Indian Wars...gripping!,"No serious student of history, or anyone with the slightest interest in colonial America can read Eckert without becoming completely engrossed in the narration and the unbelievable attention to detail, and volume of detail, that are provided in his novles.In this novel, the attempts by the British and the French to gain favor and alliance with the Indian tribes, and in particular the Iroquois League are so very well documented and then stated in a manner that flows like a gripping thriller novel.The attempts and efforts by both nations to control the new continent lead to war, and it is a brutal and ferocious war told by one of the best story tellers around. I would recommend these books to anyone."
4,Very good reading for history lovers,"I only rate this book a 4, because the first book in the series, ""The Frontiersman"" is the best, and I rated it a 5. But really, this book is great reading.If your kid is bored with history, this series of books should make him not so bored.However, I would start with ""The Frontiersman"" as it is the best."
5,Widerness Empire,"Second time I have read it the first time was over 25 years ago, it is an oustanding narative of the early days of America detailing important events in the early setteling of our country."
5,A True Classic,"If you love classic Westerns, This is for you. The settings and the drama are nothing less than spectacular."
5,perhaps the best season ever!,"The Oakley/Weinstein years were the silver age of the simpsons, and when it best hit its comedic stride. four of my top 20 episodes are here!"
4,Good,"This season has some terrific episodes, along with a few disappointments. The previous season is definitely more consistent. A couple of highlights include Radioactive Man and Much Apu About Nothing. A fun season, though not the best one."
4,Why they use crap packaging is beyond me...,"I own all of the series and love the show. Why does FOX and others continue to use crappy packaging? The head idea is pure stupidity. However, the ""digipak"" is close behind. Paper is ridiculous medium for DVDs or CDs. It is not durable whatsover. I will not buy CDs that are not in a jewel box. I put up with DVDs in paper, because I watch them at home. Why don't they put the Simpsons in the standard plastic snap case with multiple disc trays? The DVDs are protected and the outside is durable and its, surprise...cheaper!!! FOX does this other countries for the Simpsons. I don't get it."
1,I Confirm and Verify Last Review...This Book Was Disappointment,There are good outsourcing how-to books that came out in 2005...I have two. I also bought Corbett's book through Amazon and gave it to the local library for their community rummage sale as it couldn't be returned for my money back. The info is dated and the advice is too subjective.
2,High level Overview of Outsourcing.,"Provides a simple overview of why, what and how. Note: Books Does Not get into process details or offshoring details."
1,Nothing New,"The arguement on why to outsource has been debated ad nauseum. Either you see the financial and organization value or you're behind the curve.Most business leaders are convinced, but if you're not, this book will provide you the same old reasons. I found the book dated as compared to other selections on outsourcing in the book store.My suggestion is borrow this one...don't buy it."
2,Easy read but not extremely instructional,"I was hoping for more, and found it in other outsourcing books I found here in Amazon. This book is more of a consultant's calling card than a guide or manual of how to outsource correctly. It is certainly not the earth-shaker some of these other book reviews spout. Also, I have done a bestseller search several times here under term ""outsourcing"" and two other books have consistently come up as the bestseller, not this book as another reviewer below suggests. Let the buyer beware."
4,Strange Debate,"I can tell you in India and Singapore where I work in management for a rather large outsourcing firm (which, by the way has moved many USA jobs away from the Americas to us), that the book is well received.It might not be magical or ground-breaking but its instructional and thought-provoking no matter how many times you read its content and from wherever you may read it otherwise.Perhaps the Americans and Brits are still very angry that outsourcing has spoiled what they selfishly thought were only their career ladders and choices. Now that foreigners have opportunities brought clearer from a book like this, Americans get annoyed and nasty at the messenger.I am thankful to Mr Corbett for his contribution to equalizing our countries(even if that had to mean hurting the American worker.)He has given us overseas the information we needed to level the playing field."
1,Good for Historical View on Outsourcing but Not Cutting Edge Current View,"This books is a short, conversational style (not instructive or informational) read that will leave you largely unsatsified if you are looking for a how-to, why-is, where-are, or what-if.Outsourcing and offshoring are evolving too quickly and they've already left this offering behind. This book addresses the when-did and who-was, as in personal memoirs. Its not what I would categorize a business book and I think that is what people have expected of it. You get what you pay for so don't let the value price fool you. It was one of the originals but the bookshelves have filled with dozens of much more value provided guides on the subject matter.Borrow - don't buy, is my advice"
1,"Dangerous to life, health and purse","These outsourcing firms like Corbett's promise the world, I can tell you that first hand, and at first glance this book reads like a font of wisdom. However, I learned painfully that if something sounds too good to be true it is. We gave up after six months of Hell, trying to work with an Indian call team. They were incomprehensible to most of our customers, and we lost 30% of our customer base! Not to mention the death threats from the anti-outsourcing nuts out there - one published my address and phone number on a site, as well as my kid's names and where they go to school! The bottom line: you get what you pay for. Stay away from Corbett and his kind; they'll lead you down the path to ruin."
3,Plastic Looking,"I have used many metallic spray paints, this one did not impress. It just didn't look like metal. Not worth the money."
4,paint ssticks to the surface,this paint was great for the price i had painted a bike i had just recently bought made my bike look good but it was just wasnt enough paint to cover my whole bike the way i use paint i will post up a picture of it leater
5,GREAT SHINE!,I was reluctant to spend the extra money... after using it earlier today I am SOOOOO glad that I did! It looks great! And you should have seen the ugly bathroom rack that I painted with it.... LOOKS AMAZING! Great Buy!
1,Stay AWAY from this stuff!!!,"Sorry...there is no substitution for the real thing!I tried this stuff on my microwave and the color and texturelooks as fake as can be. It doesn't look like stainless steel.It looks like grey paint, silver paint or something in between but it ain't stainless steel. My alternative is to now contact one of these online companies that can custom cut a piece of stainless steel each for my microwave and oven.JT"
5,The creme de la creme of New Orleans,"I love the New Orleans sound and Kid Ory was one of the town's great ambassadors for that matter. His Band had the creme de la creme of New Orleans players. I am really attached to his Muskrat Ramble interpretation but you can find here a chest full of gems, not just one or two occasional good moments (like with so many other unfortunate artists of the period).ASV has done a great remastering work here but for some it is not enough. I know.Although the quality of recording may sound poor to those ears, compared with Ory's 50's and 60's late bloom recordings, you should at least taste the feeling of one old Grandpa's Spells before dismissing this vintage records as some museum pieces or a lesson in history.Yes, sure, it could function as both but it is much more than that. The music here is alive!All the rare and special of New Orleans is preserved here note by note and you can actually hear the streets and visualize the band marching down there."
2,Better compasses out there....,"This compass doesn't have an on / off switch but appears to switch off when not in use. I suspect mine has a fault as it keeps losing it's calibration.At the end of the day, this is a budget compass and I certainly wouldn't rely on it for orienteering or anything life saving!"
2,"Not a good product, bad quaility, display fads battery compartment cheap","I bought this and it was not a good product, bad display, fads battery compartment cheap, better to buy a non digital or you may get lost in the woods with a nice hungry bear chasing you as you freeze and your wife nags you about your navigation skills."
4,Bought this Compass for my directionally challenged family,"While some might think that this was a practical joke, I purchased this item for my aunt who, while reading mapquest, google maps, etc directions, will get extremely frustrated when being told to ""start out going south on such and such road"", with no idea which way ""south"" is. This is an affordable way to overcome this difficulty, while also providing entertainment in the car for long road trips. I would definitely recommend for any directionally challenged members of your family!"
3,Perfect for some,"This is a great little machine for portable usage.I do wish there were more formats to choose from.I do wish there wasn't a delay in immediate record time.I love the USB port so much.I take this with me everywhere I go around my neck.All in all, for the price, this is a nice little toy to capture life with when you don't want to lug around anything bigger or more expensive."
3,No auto switch?,"It's a pain to have to turn this on and off manually. It sounds OK - about what you might expect for the price. I actually bought a Polk 10"" for $100 on sale that beats the heck out of this one!"
2,Lasted 46 months and went dead!,"Sony subwoofer went dead after 46 months of light use. Used only for DVD movies, and never turned up beyond normal. I expected something this simple to last longer. Sony products either break in a shorter time that normal, or they last for a longer time than normal. The quality seems to be unpredictable. This sub is still for sale at BestBuy Stores. I bought a Polk sub woofer from Amazon, rather than another Sony.Over the past three years I have not been buying Sony products, and every time I make the mistake and buy Sony, they seem to break down. In addition, they are overpriced on their products if they cannot make a product that lasts."
4,great little addition to your stereo system,"To add a little extra to the bottom end of my garage stereo system, I bought this Sony sub to augment a Bose Acoustimass speaker system. The front side power switch adds a bit of flexibility as you can power it down easily if you really don't want or need the extra low end. For under $100 it's got to be one of the better sonic improvement bargains you'll ever find."
4,Sony SA-WM250 Subwoofer,This product performs very well and is a good buy for those wantign to enhance the sound of their entertainment system that did not come with this type speaker.
5,WoW!,"Bought a Sherwood home theater tuner/amp to take advantage of all those unused speakers in the basement bought over a 20 year period. Hooked up five speakers and had a great sound. Bought this damaged box special at Radio Shack warehouse outlet and then watched Starwars 4, 5 & 6 again. What an amazing differance. It doubled the intensity of the surround sound experience."
4,GRAND PRIZE WINNER - FRANKFURT eBOOK AWARDS,"This witty and amusing Frankfurt eBook Award winner positions Edgar Allan Poe, that most mysterious of literary legends, in the appropriate medium of murder and mystery. A clearly delineated plot and straightforward prose make this a quirky mystery right up an ebook reader's alley. It's a modern blend of literary history and spunky humor that deserves its Frankfurt nod. ~Publishers Weekly"
3,Jedi Junkies,"It was an interesting movie, done in the vain of the Star Trek fan ones. I enjoyed it - but I don't think they touched on everything Jedi."
2,Another Lifeless Documentary,"It takes great skill to make an interesting documentary, and it's clear that these folks did not have said skill. It's boring, drones on, and seems to fixated on women dressed as Slave Leia. Even the most die hard Star Wars fans will find this documentary to be a waste of time."
2,Boring,"Very boring. Go back and watch ""George Lucas versus the People"" if you want a good documentary. The best part of this one is the guy who makes lightsabers, but that is only a few minutes in the very middle. The rest is an endless barrage of people showing their star wars toy collection and their fan films."
2,Eh... worth one look.,"I thought quite a bit about how to describe this one and what I came up with was: Informative but not entertaining. Doesn't come close to the really engaging Trekkies fan-based documentaries primarily due to a consistent feeling of a blase, routine, and dull look at what really could and should have been an easy one to produce: a look at Star Wars fans. Instead, the filmmakers seemed to choose the dullest and most lifeless subjects they could have picked, and presented them in an equally banal and uninteresting way. If you are a Star Wars fan, it's probably worth watching once, but even then you'll probably be disappointed. Hopefully, someone else will give this subject matter a try in the future (pardon the fun) and give us something more deserving of the material."
1,Worst Star Wars documentary ever!,I am a huge Star Wars fan and have seen a lot of Star Wars documentaries and this has to be the worst. Don't be fooled by the Slave Leia on the front of the box. This is very bad and very boring. Don't waste your money!
5,The FIRST book you should read.,"I think this book is great, it addresses the children involved in infidelity much more than any other book I have read. It also explores how people can react when you confide in them. I honestly think this is the very first book people should read upon discovering an infidelity. It can act as a great guide post keeping the situation from getting any worse than it already is. Pretty quick read, and VERY helpful."
2,"Used book, paid for new",The shipment was late for a few days and I received a used book eventhought I paid for a new one....
3,big,"way bigger then i thought it would be it smell really latexy/silconey and seemed sorta sticky, when i took it out of the package but i think most things of that material are. it is hard to keep it lubed up enough it seems to absorb lube. it seems like an overall good product just not the one for me"
3,"Very Average, Not Great at all!","I received the steamer with very large visible scratches on the top. If I wasnt in such dire need for the steamer I would have returned it. I thought oh well its just cosmetic so I kept it. Then after I threw out all the packaging etc. one of my clients complained that as she was being steamed, large ""spits"" of water kept hitting her randomly in the face from the steamer. This is very scary because it could potentially burn someone. I also dont like that the spray of steamer is very weak! I have to almost put the flow right on the client's face to have them feel it. Pretty Dissappointed, but I really needed a steamer and couldn't afford to go without one while a return would have been in process."
1,STAY CLEAR!,"After only owning this wireless router for about 2 months, I am now shopping around for a replacement travel wireless access point. This device's firmware is EXTRMELY buggy... here are a few of the issues that I have noticed while using this paper weight:1) If you use WPA-PSK with this device, expect your connection to drop every 60 minutes -- and sometimes at random. The only way to recover from this is to either wait it out (about 5 minutes) or reboot the WGR-101 (about 3 minutes).2) This device is EXTRMELY slow -- and what I mean by this is not network speed, but the WGR-101s processing speed. As I mentioned above, it takes the device about 3-4 minutes to fully boot this device.3) I tested WEP briefly on this device and noticed some issues with this as well. The connection would drop as it did with WPA-PSK, only it seemed to be at random.If you are looking for a reliable travel wireless access-point, this device is NOT for you."
1,I wish 0 stars was an option,"I bought this quite a while ago, and finally got the opportunity to use it. (or at least try to use it)Setup was very easy, but I could not get it to work in shared mode. Windows didn't think I was connected to the internet. I searched live.com for this product and found others are having the same issue. Apparently like another review says, there is an issue with DNS passthrough. I was able to get it working, but won't be taking it on another trip with me."
1,Worked great for four months . . .,"then it died. I purchased it months earlier, but never used it until four months ago. Yesterday, the lights went off and the router stopped working. I called Netgear's support line, and they ran me through some questions and then informed me that the one-year warranty had expired and the router it is bad and cannot be repaired."
2,fair,This product was not that satisfied to me..... thats why I about to buy another router. this product is usefull only for a temporary use only. It is good if you use this for 2-4 hours only. If you keep this connected daily the connection automatically gets disconnects since this is mentioned for travel purpose only.
1,If all you use are default settings it works sometimes.,"This product has serious firmware problems in two areas, encryption and DNS. I have spent many frustrating hours when I could have been getting work done. Upgrading the firmware makes it no better. However if you don't make any changes to the default configuration (do not encrypt your connection), reset the unit each time you use it, and are lucky and it passes through the address of the DNS server, perhaps you won't notice anything wrong. At least for the first few times. Eventually everyone who buys this product realizes it's got problems. Netgear is of course no help because they are told to treat everything as a user problem. It's so small and could be so useful, I really hoped it would be OK, despite the negative reviews I saw. Now I must join those negative reviewers. Don't think a firmware upgrade will fix it or that you will figure out the correct configuration. This product is a waste of your valuable time."
2,Not happy,"I purchased this for my daughter to put on her first car, She loves anything with a rebel flag. I was disappointed when she opened it, it looks like it was used on the one side it has little bubbles on it like it is going to peel."
4,Gentle folk sound .,"An album whose songs run gently into one another . Warm , perhaps melancholic , a smooth easy listen . Music that would appeal across the generations . Definitely worth having in the collection . ( it just arrived , and I immediately played it twice , pretty darn good stuff ) ."
3,"Recommended, with reservations.","Grant has, perhaps, the best voice in popular music. For that reason alone, I think the album (like his others) deserves more attention than it is likely to garner. On the other hand, as a long time fan I'm dissappointed with what he's done with his voice on every album since Mighty Joe Moon. He sounded uncanny on that album, and on subsequent albums he's simply great. Not exactly scathing criticism, granted, but frustrating all the same. He's more or less abandoned the truly compelling and nuanced baritone that distinguished MJM and Fuzzy. He now vascillates between breathy but high, high, and really high. Still sounds great, but he's dropped the torch I had hoped would pass from Van Morrison. Still, I'll buy every album he cuts to see if he picks it back up, and casual fans should not be discouraged. If you haven't heard him, you're missing out."
3,Personal Best,"Grant-Lee Phillips has a big angelic voice that, when he's lucky, doesn't turn him into a fool. Artists blessed with pipes this pure have a tendency to either coast or overreach (k.d. lang; Thom Yorke; Jeff Buckley) with mixed results. Phillips certainly did both on his Grant Lee Buffalo CDs, as well as write and perform songs of delicacy and scope (especially their debut Fuzzy). On Mobilize, he maintains his focus and sense of stability (except on the opener ""See America"", which is too grand for what follows). It bests his previous Fuzzy highlights - ""Love's a Mystery"" and ""Like a Lover"" are ace - and bodes well for his future as a minor artist with modest sales (like his heroes Michael Stipe, a cult artist writ large, and Robyn Hitchcock, cult by default)."
1,Aural Wallpaper,"To sum up Grant Lee Phillips new career direction, I have a chosen this phrase: A day late and a dollar short. Having heard songs that Phillips wrote about 10 years and comparing them to this is silly. This material is dreck fit for the consumption of fans too ignorant to move onto better artists and better material."
5,Tacos?,"I just sat down to read a book that is not ""Son of Orbiting Death Ray Platform"" and, can I just say, it is NOT ""Son of Orbiting Death Ray Platform"". This book is about some rockstars or rich kids with not enough money or too much time and not enough taco seasoning - very disappointing. Truth be told, I knew going into it that it was not ""Son of Orbiting Death Ray Platform"" and really I've been served the dish of fudge that I ordered. I made my own platform, now I've got to sleep under it's looming shadow. I tried to run out on not ""Son of Orbiting Death Ray Platfrom"", but was caught on account of all the tacos; that IS a lot of gas, you know. Had I known now what I knew then, I don't think I would have ever put this book in my dishwasher. I think that really says it all. It really is a penultimate read."
3,Nice boots but fancier than well built,"I recently purchased these boots and I have to say that I have mixed feelings about them.1.- On one side they are confortable to the feet, although a bit tight on the ankle, especially when you put them in, but I only expect them to strech-out a bit since they are new.2.- I have used this pair of boots less than 10 times so far, in a regular way, and the heel of the right one already peeled on one side and also it separated from the leather section, which is strange, considering the brand.Now, I have to say on my behalve that I owned a similar pair of boots made by Bostonian for 8 years and they werer excellent. I bought the Timberlands to change the Bostonian ones and I am disapointed. I am affraid to send them back and get the same quality pair back.In few words, the design is nice, they are confortable but the quality is not reliable. Be prepare to send them back."
3,Just Average,"There are a lot of books on investing in the markets. This one is just average. Personally, I found the layout of the book to be very 'busy' and disorganized. I think there are a number of other books that would help the beginning/novice investor more than this one. Look at my other reviews for suggestions."
3,Advice for the novice investor,"This book is for the reader who is new to investing. If you are interested in investing in the stock market, but are worried about the outcome, then this books provides some good advice. The investment approach recommended is truly for very conservative types - but the truth is, that the author's recommendations have worked well in the past and are worth consideration by all investors. Reviewed by the author of THE SHORT BOOK ON OPTIONS."
2,Bizarre effects - actually keeps me awake,"It seems as that this product works differently for each person. On a few occasions that I have used this product, I have had a very difficult time sleeping. I experience incessant itching and generally increased skin sensitivity. Also, almost as if the chemicals in Cyclin are working as advertised, I begin to very rapidly fall into sleep, but so rapidly that my body ""notices"" it and I involuntarily jerk myself awake. It is very bizarre to say the least. Nevertheless, I have noticed some decrease in muscle soreness after my leg workouts."
4,Poor white,"Freakwater may seem like a band that has more in common with Gillian Welch or The Handsome Family. So it is equally weird that this record is released on Thrill Jockey. The band Califone produces this record, so that would make more sense. The interest in American roots music has become more pronounced every year. This year alone we have similar minded records by BRMC and Abigail Washburn. Freakwater comes off more like The Carter family than most. The core of the band are two women: Catherine Irwin and Janet Bean. They have doing records for over 15 years. This is very soothing."
4,Bitter Ladies,My wife doesn't like this album I do. A companion to Randy Newman's Bad Love on my CD changer.
3,Central Tools 3M230 Digital Brake Rotor Micrometer,"I bought this item to determine the condition of my rear rotors. It worked fine, but this item is a lower quality of the Central Tools line of equipment. This is fine for me, but for the Professional, it might make a difference. Also, my Micrometer came in a plastic case, not the nice wooden one shown in the photo - not a big issue again for me. The Micrometer is easy to use and appears to be a fine tool for the individual that wants a good tool to use. Todd H."
1,Not Suitable for Family,This video Series does not engender typical family values regarding marital relationships between a man and a woman. It flaunts permiscuity.
2,A solid 2 1/2 stars....,"I picked up this first novel at a used book sale (perfect condition; price $3) shortly after it was published. I did not get around to reading it until a couple of weeks ago. The tone of the book was sort of ""Seinfeld"" crossed with ""Sex and the City,"" or maybe more accurately, ""Seinfeld"" if it had been on cable TV.It is set in NYC in the 1990's. That part is nice, but the protagonist was not enjoyable to me. I have been trying to find out if this Andrew Postman is the same Andrew Postman who gave the eulogy at his famous father's funeral (Neil Postman). The eulogy was one of the most sensitive pieces of writing I ever read. If the author of this book is indeed the same Andrew Postman, I wish he would have injected this first novel with the same humanity as was in that eulogy."
4,"Good Quality, Runs Small","I think for the money, this is a good tee. It's nicer than Hanes or Fruit of the Loom. However, it runs quite small. My brother wears a boys' size 10. I ordered him the L (14-16). It seems to fit quite well after washing it. It shrunk a fair amount after 3 washings. Sturdy? I'll find out!"
4,A good book for LITB fans,"As a Leave it to Beaver fan, I really enjoyed this book. Jerry Mathers opens up his life and tells many behind the scenes stories about his career and the ongoings of the television show. The book is about ""The Beav"" and as a result, some people may (and are) put off by some of Jerry's ""bragging"". While this does seem to happen in the book, the information and stories that he provides more than makes up for this. A nice touch is towards the end of the book where he gives some of the television show cast members their turn to talk about how they felt about the series. Gee, Beav, are you gonna write another one?"
5,A must for any baby boomer!,"As a baby boomer, I grew up watching ""Leave It To Beaver"". Jerry Mathers does a great job of describing his life as ""The Beaver"" on the show and how it compared with his personal life away from the studio. He gives the reader a thorough description of the ups and downs of being a child actor and how it has affected his adult life. What a trip down memory lane!! If you ever wondered what happened to all those wonderful characters on the show, then I encourage you to buy this book. It's a ""Where are they now?"" readers dream. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. I now look forward to reading Frank Banks book about his acting days on the set of ""Leave It To Beaver""."
5,Leave It To Beaver Fan,If Your a Leave It To Beaver fan you will find this book very enjoyable. I found out many behind the scenes bits of information that gave me an even greater appreciation for the series.
3,"Used in Madonna's ""Sex Book Movie""","If you watch Madonna's rare ""Sex"" movie, you will hear the songs ""La Mer"" and ""Boum!"" playing in addition to some other french singers. The film was shot on Super8, so there's no sound. The sound that was added included those songs. Just wanted to point that out..."
5,If it's good enough for Rush It's good enough for me!,I heard this on the Rush Limbaugh show yesterday and I fell in love with it. Thanks Rush for a new genre to listen to!
4,Great,These filters are great in our humidifier. Never had a problem with them and the order came in fast.
2,Short lived filters and there are only 3 per box (not 3 sets),"I believe it's necessary to let everyone know that there are only 3 individual filters in the box, not 3 sets as the description says. I purchased this as a replacement for the standard filters that I normally use and because they were cheaper and another review said they would work I figured I'd try it. However, these were not a direct replacement (at least not right out of the box). I was able to get these to fit by cutting off some of the bottom and then they were able to fit, so I was able to use them. The life of these lasted less than a month, but as another reviewer stated, the wicks are a necessary evil."
3,They're fine.,what's not to like? They're fine.We're currently processing your review and we will email you at warrenwh@pacbell.net as soon as this is complete
5,Works great!,I bought two sets and have been using one in my Bionaire humidifier for a few weeks. Fits perfectly and wicks well. It has put several gallons of moisture into the air already. Don't forget to wet the filter thoroughly when you first use it and each time you refill the water container. Good price and fast shipping too!
4,Filter,"Does the job. All of the filters I purchased seemed less beefy than last year. I hope that this is not an overall decline in quality. They work fine, but it's been two weeks. I'll have to wait to see if they last."
5,Good replacement,"My originals were shot, so I bought these as a replacement. They filters worked well, with no problems at all."
4,Humidifier filter,This humidifier is ok to cleanworks greatThis qty is good if you use this humidifier alotThe filter quality was fine
1,filter,This filter is no good. It lasted only a week. I tried to wash it everyday but it still didn't work the way its supposed to work. I will never buy a holmes product anymore.HWF100 Holmes Humidifier Replacement Filter
2,Not the same filter!,"This was delivered 2 weeks later than promised and it is not the same filter as shown in the photo. It is a cheaper version and did not have the round button attached to the filter like the original has. It had a plastic square that could be attached anywhere but really won't stay put when attached so I just left it off.Fortunately, just by stuffing the new filter into my machine, it worked Ok. I really hate returning stuff. It is just frustrating when they show a picture and you receive something else."
3,"not the right filter for my unit, but they work","I have a hard time finding filters for my Sunbeam cool mist humidifier. These are a little long, but when trimmed they work fine. They come 3 to a pack and the unit needs 2 filters at a time, so I buy 2 packages at a time."
3,Holmes Filters Seem Flimsy,"Purchased the replacement filters for my Holmes Humidifier. They seem much more flimsy than the filters than originally came with the humidifier. Unfortunately, due to the season change, I am no longer able to purchase them in store, so I purchased them online. They work, but I am not sure the quality of the filter is the same as the previous ones I had."
2,Won't last long,"The filter works just fine.The problem is that mineral deposits build up very quickly in the filter, and it will become hard and lose its ability to absorb water upwards. Only the part always in the water stays wet.Each filter lasts 2-3 weeks and then you have to replace it!"
2,poor quality,These filters seem not to last as long or stay as clean as previous ones I've purchased. These seem to need to be replaced sooner.
3,"Filters Work, But Why 3?","Obviously the filters work. They are just filters after all. However, they really should come in packs of two at a cheaper price, or packs of 4 at a slightly higher price. My humidifier takes two at a time so that only makes sense."
3,fail,bought six of these so i could use em 3 times....put new filters in worked 3 days and humidifier took a dump fan quit working. Bionaire was barely over 1 year old. Went and bought one that has no filter.works better
1,Fragile Wicks - Is not durable,"Even with a very light use and not wringing them or handling very softly, the filter had weared out. Very weak and fragile wicks and is not durable for even few months. Not recommended."
3,Generic version of what is advertised,"These are not the original Holmes filters as advertised, but an off-brand version. They are the same size as the originals so guess they will do the job."
3,Order Review,Item received were a substitute for the filters made by Holmes and I was not satisfied with them. They were returned to the seller and I was refunded my costs. I appreciate the effort the seller made to ensure I received the actual product I wanted.
5,Great source for filters,"Decent price and great service make this a quality source for hard to find humidifier filters at a good price, thanks."
4,Good Value,These were the best value I could find. Only thing keeping this from being 5 stars is that they took an unusually long time to arrive.
1,Problems,"Bought a new HP MD6580, delivery from New York to LA took 9 days by ground which was very reasonable.TV worked great for 1 week and then died. Three HP factory service calls and two weeks later the TV is still Dead and the tech team has no ideas for a next step.Have been told that HP will consider a swap of my new (but non-functional TV) with a REFURBISHED TV, but no definitive answer as the HP ""Quality"" department is very busy and has not returned my calls.Very frustrating"
3,Get On The Dance Floor,"Get It Together marks a decided shift in the band's sound. Gone are the soulful ballads and r&b rhythms and entering are thumping disco beats and heavy dance sounds. The title track fires the opening salvo, but it is the propulsive ""Hum Along & Dance"" that shows off their new sound. It is a dance floor classic and its hypnotic beat drives you to the dance floor. ""Dancing Machine"" appears in a different version that the hit song and the band made a good decision to remix it. Get It Together started bringing a sound that young Michael would cultivate for the rest of the 70's."
2,No new ground plowed here,"Mediocre writing, recycled plot. Told in the first person, a difficult voice that this author has not mastered."
3,Too old to be useful,"This book was published in '89, yet it still covers 32 bit operating systems. I recently bought the book for a used local store, hoping on finding help creating my own operating system. I was sadly disapointed.First, the 32 bit section was almost purely theoretical. Remember, that was before Windows 3.0-- which was just a shell for DOS. It was even slightly before Linux!The 8 and 16 bit sections were detailed, but they focused on hard ware, and not how to contol it. If you have a good understanding of C or preferbly assembler, it might help. 16 bit is sadly outdated, though, so unless your trying to write an OS for the dinosaur in your garage, don't waste your time.I'm disreguading the 4 bit section-- 4 bit processors have enough umph to power traffic lights, and not a whole lot more.I gave this book 3 stars despite the fact it didn't help much, because when 16 bit programming was in its hay day (Late 80's, early 90's) this book would have been a lot more helpful."
4,Camera Battery,The battery seems to be a very good battery so far. I just didn't realize how big it would be until I got it. It is about half as big as my video camera. But at least it last so I can video tape longer times without recharging. I gave it 4 stars just because the battery is sooo big.
1,Not compatible at all,"Bought on Amazon at December 2006. Battery not compatible with any Everio Models. My vacation was destroyed as original jvc batteries not yet available in my country. I was not able to use camera on resort at all.Sent to Lenmar to exchange on January 25, 2007. Still waiting(March 2007). I checked battery with all JVC Everio camera's available in BestBuy. ""Wrong connection"" appeared on all of them.[...]"
5,AppleCare Protection Plan,"Always buy this whenever I buy a laptop, since laptops have such an immense amount of micro engineering and gets a lot of mobil use. Worth every penney if anything goes wrong with the laptop. I've used AppleCare in the past and have never had a problem with them."
4,Nice Plan,"With apple stores and friendly employees, this is a nice plan. if you think you need it, get it."
2,"Not worth it for Tech-Support, maybe for parts","It's possible that parts replacemnt is worth the price, assuming something major does go wrong, but I have two major issues with AppleCare:1) When your case is open, don't expect your engineer to ever call you back. I have never received a callback or e-mail from them---ever. I have an issue with my 17"" Mac-Book Pro that has been an issue for six months! I have to keep opening new cases! my laptop also has an issue they can't solve, and won't even talk of replacing anything.2) AppleCare hours suck.So, get this: The iPhone was released in the U.S. at 5PM on a Friday evening. Isn't that close to the time AppleCare support closes for the weekend? Sneaky, hunh?So, what did I really pay for? Complete waste of money!"
4,Works ok for me,I just purchased this from avancity and everything went very smoothly for me. I just successfully registered my early 2009 MBP.
2,Beware - This is not insurance . . .,"Both of my children have MacBooks for school and have been told that AppleCare is void once there are any dents or other indications that the MacBook may have been dropped. My daughter brought her MacBook in for a drive problem and was told she would have to leave it there for several days so she decided to wait. Then, when she brought it back for the repair she was told it was not covered because it looked like the computer had been dropped. The service is fine for software problems, but the chance that a college student's laptop will be in pristine condition after a year is pretty low, so next time I'll save my money."
1,Applecare is Necessary but Beware of This Product,"I am in North Carolina and ordered this product. I don't know if there is issue with NC, but there is no warning on this.If you own an Apple product, you owe it to yourself to get the 3-year warranty with AppleCare. Don't make the same mistake my sister-in-law did! She had to replace an iMac that was 14 months old (weird since I own 2 and never had trouble).However this product may or may not work. The seller did not ship me anything, but gave me a number over email to register the product online. This failed. When contacted, Advancity (the seller) told me to call AppleCare Support to get it registered. 30 minutes of wasted time later, and Apple says that I have to get a refund.Buyer beware of this product from this seller!"
3,"Extends your warranty, but I'd like to see more options","Although this extends your warranty on a laptop to 3 years, it only covers parts that fail over the next few years. For $350, I'd like to seem them offer some accidental damage protection."
2,Do not buy this for 13 inch MacBook Pro!,This is not for the new 13 inch MacBook Pro. Had to find out through Apple tech support that this is the wrong one. Working on getting a refund from Amazon so I can get the correct plan. Packaging and description is confusing!!
2,Save over 50% on the MacBook Pro APP somewhere else......,Great product but APPLE & Amazon's price is way too high. I was able to purchase this at THE well known auction site at 52% off and I received verification from Apple of my coverage!
5,Great,Great product. Actually I already used it :-)AppleCare Protection Plan for MacBook Pro/Powerbook MA515LL/A 3 Years
1,Beware AppleCare,"Simply put, Apple is contemptuous of it's customers.I brought my 11 month old $2500 MacBook Pro to the Apple Store in for a broken enter key and was told that the dent in the butter-rigid aluminum case from a slight drop that happened 10 months ago voided my AppleCare THAT I HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED USING YET (AppleCare covers from month 13 thru 36.) They offered to ""recertify"" my AppleCare for $600-$1200 dollars (HELLO!!! I can get a NEW Dell with equivalent specs for $500!!!) The computer has no problems other than a failing battery and a broken enter key (OBVIOUSLY those issues were not caused by the dent.)Rather than support their customer their looked for a way to limit their liability. Apple SUX. Don't enable their contemptuous behavior towards their customers by continuing to buy their products. Maybe if more people stop acting like they had Stockholm Syndrome Apple would start acting like a company than understands how to support it's customers.Hello Mr. Dell! I'm back again."
1,"Don't get for 13"" MacBook Pro","Apple informed me that you have to get the Care Plan for the MacBook, which doesn't make sense but hey it's cheaper."
1,Disappointed and apalled!,"A dangerous book for almost any woman to read. The author believes we should all strive to be Elle Mcpherson (who, by the way, must choose between 2 meals a day) or other supermodels and female celebrities who fast for days to lose wieght. The diet ""tip"" are hackneyed and there is not one passage about learning to like yourself."
1,ridiculous! Not worth the paper it is printed on!,"Diane, what exactly are you professing? That we all adopt ridiculous ""hollywood secrets"" to become anorexic in order to be thin? Your tips are dangerous, not sound nutrition and make you look like a snake-oil salesman trying to peddle this junk to the dieters of America. Really, there needs to be some sort of standard someone must pass before they can put out a diet book, like that you should have had to atleast have been heavy once and used these tips to lose weight. Those that can't.......teach~! right Diane!?"
4,Loved it,"This book can make you feel like you're overhearing a conversation between supermodels. Personally, I loved hearing all of the diet ""secrets"" of the celebs. Although not all of the tips worked for me, I've lost 5 pounds with the help of this book, and this book only. It has great diet plans inside, as well as exercise tips."
3,Pretty good diet tips... if you want to be a stick thin model,"This book really does what it sets out to do. It tells you the tricks models and celebrities use to get skinny, like only eating 2 meals a day (many models) and having a piece of chicken for breakfast (Cameron Diaz). If you are interested in little tricks, this is the book for you. For overall health, I'd have to take away a couple of stars. Some things these people do are obviously unhealthy. I'd recommend the Live Food Factor if you care more about your overall health, rather than just want to get skinny."
4,OFF THE CHAIN,This book is a bit old school but the remedies in here actually works and its always best to use things that are naturally prepared for us. I even shared this book with my co workers and they went and order them also.
3,Read it in a half hour,"I actually kind of like that this book is laid out in ""snipets"" of information. Most of it you've heard before. Each ""dieter"" has a completely different approach, so I found it to be confusing. But really all that means is the old ""whatever works for you""."
3,When will we have a book by a real woman who used to be fat,"I think that the book is good overall, however, I am tired of people whom have never had a weight problem telling us what we have to do to be thin, walk in my shoes, then offer improvement!!"
2,not a comfortable fit...,"this headset paired easily with my t68i and provided very good reception but there were a couple of issues that led me to return this accessory:1. the headset won't stay put. as hard as i tried, i could not get comfortable with the way this headset attached to my ear. i had to adjust it constantly and even then, i felt that the headset would come off if i moved my head too quickly.2. the headset is designed so that the speaker rests on top of your ear. this contributed to issue number 1 but also made it difficult to hear your called party. even with the headset volume at maximum, i sometimes had to press the speaker against my ear to hear clearly. kinda defeats the purpose of hands-free!3. you can only use this on your right ear.i would recommend the jabra freespeak as an alternative bluetooth headset. peace."
3,Not really about dogs.,"This is a cute, nice family movie. However, the dog(s) don't play much of a role in it. I was hoping for something more like ""Santa Buddies"" which my daughter loved. If you are looking for a dog movie, probably better to keep looking."
2,very disappointing,"THE acting was SO awful,and your lead to think its about puppies and Christmas but the story is anything but that.I had my 4 year old grandson with me and he was asking where the puppies were??? he has 2 golden labs at home The story is not bad but the screen writer and promo directors and casting was so bad its just to bad it could have been a pretty good movie."
1,DON'T BE FOOLED BY COVER,"Being a huge dog lover I thought this movie would be about dogs, even after reading the movie description. I was so wrong. Nothing about dogs, just some sappy story. Oh well, lesson learned!!"
2,Fooled by storyline review on tv,I saw the ads for it and it sounded interesting. Certainly not something you would reach for a second time review.
2,making out with your dog might be more entertaining than this movie,"How in the world are you going to put puppies on the cardboard cover, puppies on the dvd box and puppies on the dvd menu... And then have literally 1 minute of puppies in the actual movie???? This movie is a disappointment, whether you were dying for some fuzzy love or not. The cinematography is downright embarrassing and cheesy. The main character was about as lovable as a troll with herpes and the guy she falls in love with was possibly the most boring man in the world: he carves crappy wood objects for a living! The golden retriever was the best actor in this movie and she only did things my dog could do."
3,Predictable with some disappointment.,"Slow moving story that is very predictable. Expected to see more of the puppies displayed on the movie cover. It is a heartwarming story and certainly not the worst movie we have seen, but also far from the best."
1,NOT what I'd expect from a G rated movie,"Do yourself a big favor and avoid this movie. The G rating and the puppies on the cover caused my 8 and 10 year to want to watch the movie.....thank goodness I was watching it with them, we turned the movie off at about the halfway point. Why? No puppies, no kid stuff......try sexual innuendos (over and over), drug reference (""...meth lab in the basement""), and adult issues (parental death, confusion in job/career, on and on). Again, the content of this movie is NOT the same as a Disney G-rated movie and certainly not what the cover implies."
3,It Does What It's Made For,"Any nut tool will do the same job. I purchased this one because I particularly like Black Diamond products. You will need a nut tool if you purchase stoppers or hex-nuts for trad climbing. I recommend Black Diamond simply because it's my personal preference, but any nut tool will do the same job."
1,Absolutely disappointing and no value!,"I have struggled to complete this book with many moments of giving it up.The book is a consolidation of articles, methodologies and write up from others. The authors do not have much or any own inputs. They are merely combining what they could find out there.ALthough many methologies are being stated eg EVA, Information Orientation, Activity Based Costing, COBIT, I could not find how these could be used to quantify the value of IT investments in modern business world. The authors have just defined and explained the terms without any real life examples in how the quantification should be carried out.I do not extract any value from this book and felt disappointed. The book is attractive by the hpye of the title only!!!!"
1,fa davis,i have found the cd that came with this book to be a great review so mush so i have not even looked at the book much i really like the way the cd gives an explanation after you awnser each question.
1,F.A. Davi's Practice Guide for the Radiography Examination,"This product is worthless. I really don't recomend to buy it. I just bought this book because it offered a CD-ROM wich does not work with my operating system (XP). I opened from the package because it's labeled that works with XP, but it does not, it get frozen my computer as soon as it reaches 61% of installation. If you are going to prepeare for your radiographic examination the books you have used during the program will help yuo out a lot. On the other hand I could not return this product to Amazon for refund because I opened it and I tried to contact these people (F.A. Davi's publisher) trhough the internet and then they are just around the bushes solving nothing. This product has to be updated and they have to offer a better product for what you are paying for."
2,poor work,"This work is recomended by Edward T. Welch, but it is not as good as any of his works.Not only this, the ideas in it may be counter to a classical view of guidance from God.I am currently reading the book: ""Steps for Guidance in the Journey of Life"" by Peter Masters that is in opposition to the ideas put forth by this book recommended by Mr. Welch. Will try and update this later."
2,decepcionante...,"Como tantas otras escritoras latinoamericanas, Laura Esquivel pasa de ser original a totalmente comercial y sin sentido... un tema totalmente traido de los cabellos, una prosa forzada y un CD terrible. Se nota que lo escribio a las corridas... money, money, money"
4,"Es un libro muy loco, y bueno","Este libro es muy bueno, toca un tema en verdad poco explotado por la literatura: las reencarnaciones. La forma en que Laura Esquivel se aproxima al texto es muy diferente: usa el humor, la visualización del futuro como tal vez pocos lo harían, ilustraciones muy lindas, y un CD que, bajo las instrucciones de la autora, debe ser usado para bailar o para acompañar la lectura de los dibujos, según la canción o melodía. Es un libro que vale la pena."
2,"a good, user-friendly Spanish book to practice on","I would recommend this book for those who are just starting to learn Spanish, or are coming back to it after a long absence: the Spanish is easy, while not being geared for a learner.Your dictionary will choke on some of the Mexican slang, but for the most part the situation is not out of control.As for the story itself, there are some interesting ideas, though the author's ditziness certainly comes through on every page. However, if you're just looking for the language practice..."
4,Libro para Pensadores,"En La Ley del Amor, la autora pretende presentar temas que requieren pensamiento crítico, imaginación y exceptisismo. Esta novela habla de temas místicos, los rodea de una visión futurística que no tiene nada que ver con lo ridículo. Para resumir es un libro para soñadores que nos deleitamos al imaginar aquello que no podemos explicarnos sin perder la noción de la realidad. Excelente."
2,La Ley del amor,"Este libro me decepcionó. La historia, aunque pudo ser interesante y divertida, me resultó aburrida. La señora Esquivel trata de llevarnos en un viaje cósmico inverosímil y confuso donde los personajes continúan cambiando su físico y sus capacidades. El concepto, que parece interesante se convierte en una burda caricatura."
2,"1/2"" ratchet binder",I ordered a CM chain red ratchet binder #48366 made by Columbus McKinnon/Dixie and made in USA I received a Ancra International #45943-21 load binder which was made in China. I asked for refund and I was told my credit card will be credited. I will verify this on my next credit card statement.
5,The prime of the simpsons,"For me, these are the best episodes that Matt Groening and Co. have ever come out with. They are so funny, but also, and i know this sounds wierd, they are actually really good stories. The animation looks its best (compared to the early seasons).The case is brilliant, even the inside.There are a lot of episodesIts not like i have to even write this because how can you not buy the simpsons?"
4,A lot of entertainment !!,"It's certainly a lot of entertainment you get for a small amount of cash. The seventh season is one of the best. There's not a lot you can say about The Simpsons that isn't already said. Therefore I will review the package itself it's nice to look at but too soft plastic, I liked the older standard boxes better that fitted in the bokshelf. // It's really funny : )"
3,It's okay,"I wouldn't of been slightly disappointed if this dvd was rated Good instead of like new. It really wasn't like new. There was some wear on the box, when I opened the dvd box the dics fell out and weren't able to attached to the case as well. One of the discs had 2 long scratches on it and you can tell it's been buffed okay. Other than that It wasn't really that bad. Just wish It was rated differently so I could of expected something else."
5,Very Pleased with Season 7,"The shipping was fine, the package arrived right on schedule. All four discs are clean and they run excellently. I am very happy with this purchase. Thank you!"
1,Cheap Products,"Is anyone else having problems with their Simpsons DVDs? Ever since season 5 I've had to return my DVDs because one or more of the discs don't work properly and certain episodes skip. I'm stuck with a faulty season 6 because I lost my reciept and I've already discovered I need to exchange my new season 7 set thanks to at least 3 episodes that skip. (All on the 2nd disc.) Please let me know that I'm not the only one out there with this problem.The Simpsons has been one of my favorite shows since I was just a little trouble maker in elementary school. It's great, but I'm only giving it one star because of the cheap manufacturing."
3,"""If you want to watch tv, and I mean really watch it...""","This will dissappoint you. I am on my third of the 4 dvd disks, and that is the only line that really made me laugh out loud. As an owner of seasons 2-7, this was almost a waste of $, but why?All of our favorite characters are still with us (mine are Mr. Burnes, Patti & Selma, Ralph Wiggium & Lisa Simpson). Matt Groneg (sp?) is still the creator, but as some reviewers have said, the simpsons have been through every scenerio-slice of life possible and then some, and all to often now are victims of pop culture-- (remember when Dustin Hoffman guest stared and they used another name?).If Arrested Development gets cancelled, please Fox, please send some of the writers over to the Simpsons."
4,Alternative packaging again?,Does anyone know if Fox will offer the option of sending away for the sleeve to fit inside of Marge's head ala Season Six? This way we can have both packaging options instead of buying 2 sets of Season Seven...
3,The wrath of Marge-head,"Basically I said what I had to say in the review for the slip-cover version, but I will say this.I don't find this one around very much for sale. And the ones I do find are all damaged!Like the vile Homer-head package, don't expect this one to last very long before it gets damaged, if it's not already damaged when you get it."
4,A very good manga,"This manga is one of my favs. this story never gets old, the animation is a little hard to tell whats happening but its not that bad. the manga is much less modest that the anime, alot of panty shots in this one. it has the same shoujo-ai as the anime but it also has some shonen-ai with was kind of a turn off, the kurumi sense of humor is in full bloom with this one. the series has no lag in it and damn near no wasted time. the time that they spend introducing the characters is well spent and not to long (unlike the lord of the rings). the anime is still my favorite, i recomend watching it first. FYI the storys are different."
3,T&A,"Title says it all. Pretty drawing style, lots of fan service (including some shounen-ai amasingly enough - in the US they would never mix straight and gay eye candy). No plot really, no point on getting it for any other reason. For those that like that sort of thing, enjoy."
1,Xerox 8550 low quality,"I've owned two 8500/8550 printers. I was initially impressed with the print quality and the ink block technology. But both printers died, the first after 13 months and the second after 15 months. In both cases it inexplicably imploded, requiring repairs so expensive it made more sense to buy a new one. The second time I had learned my lesson: Xerox has a great technology, but they don't know how to make a durable, reliable product. I'm switching back to HP printers; I've got two HP's that are still running after years of service."
2,wont buy again,Put 2 of these on my truck. Doesn't cam enough. You will have to spin it every time to get the fork on and off. Waste of money. regret the purchase. Ended up just laying bikes in the bed. Could be good but needs improvement.
4,A hilarous look at the Insane,"Submitted for your approval. A planet populated by teddy bears. Cute, Cuddly, and friendly. Tooo friendly! I'd give the book 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that it is several short stories put together(don't like that format). I was rolling in the aisle during most of the book. The writers made one slight mistake though. No human being could live with the Hoka's for so long and not go permamently insane, or die of alcohol poisoning. :) Truely a unique book and the author(s) should be congratulated."
4,This book was FUNNY. If you enjoy drama read this book!,"Alex, a human, becomes the representative of a species called the Hoka. They are great actors and take any story seriously, and play the part for all the've got. No one can tell if they are just acting or if they really beleive they are the character. If you enjoy drama, or like to act out characters you enjoy then please join Alex in his adventures with the Hoka.Travis"
3,Average,Doesn't perform as well as advertised - average dehumidifier with no extras - better deals are available at the local hardware store.
5,My gossip magazine addiction,"I LOVE reading US on my down time. It is a mindless fun magazine that helps me relax. I love looking at the outfits the celebrities wear and trying to re-create them with thrift store clothes. I used to sit and read these with my grandmother and love looking at the pictures, and I am always happy to see US in my mailbox."
5,Great product...lousy packaging.,"I have purchased this product for many years; it is the best I've found. As a matter of fact, I like it so much, I ordered two. It out performs other hand cleaners by a mile. NOW, about the packaging; it is the most poorly done I have ever encountered with Amazon. I have been buying at Amazon for more than 10 years and have never, ever, received a mess like this...not once, but twice. See my photo #1 for original shipment...then photo #2 for one of the replacements they graciously sent out. Buy the product, just pick a different seller. 'nuf said, a picture is worth a thousand words."
4,Great Product Lousy Packaging,The hand cleaner works Great. Cleans grease and dirt from working on cars really good. Works with water and without. Container was open in shipping box first shipment and second shipment.
3,"Ahh, is it supposed to be black?",This item along with the dispenser came in one box that was pretty banged up. One of the containers had leaked out it's vent hole and the other container looked as though it had been opened and some of the cream used by someone with real dirty hands because it left a large amount of black streaks.
1,Men's Sexuality Series 3 Volume Set,I would not recomment these 3 DVD's to anyone. A waste of time and money.In fact I do not think I will buy anymore of these type of DVD's. It left mevery cold and uneducated. Poor quality images.
5,Folk Music Memories,"It was great to hear the Kingston Trio again. I listened to them as a teenager. My favorate is ""Fast Freight."" I hope this is part of a new Folk Reival."
1,Incompetent,"The product arrive missing most of the hardware.The package containing the screws and other assembly hardware had been obviously opened, screws removed and the torn-open package put into a ziplock bag and put in the box.Rest assured that we WILL be contacting the supplier immediately, but in the meantime, save yourself the hassle and shop elsewhere.If Amazon's policy on 3rd party supplier's remains ""it's not our problem, call the supplier"", I would suggest shopping on a completely different site altogether."
3,CONNECTS TO SERIAL PORT!,"I purchased this modem thinking it was a USB modem. It is not. Instead, this connects to your computer's serial port. The item description should make this clearer."
3,complicated,"seems promising, but installing is a great hassle. Technical Support department extremely weak. don't buy unless you are a professional."
5,No issues,"I have had this modem for a couple of months now. It is working just fine, Windows Xp Pro with SP2 automatically reconized themodem. I didn't even have to install the drivers that came with the modem. Works just as good under linux as it does windows xp pro"
4,Sand Castle Mold Rip-Off,"These molds are extremely over-priced. Add the S&H charges and you'll pay many dollars per mold. If you search the toy section at Target, you will find the same items (and more choices) for $0.99 each. Target Sand Castle Molds have the same quality but also have an attached plastic handle on the molds for easy-out removal of molded sand. If you buy at Target, you'll pay for taxes, but not shipping."
2,Expected More,"When I did a search for sand castle molds the result was the smaller molds. The large ones popped up stating that they were sold separately. Since the picture had several different shapes and you did not have an option to choose, I assumed you would get all of the pictured molds. With shipping I paid over $15.00 for one mold. This is definitely not worth the price. I do not recommend that anyone purchase this item."
1,Ripoff,"For this price, I thought all 4 molds pictured came together. I was shipped a single blue mold. Way overpriced for the one item. Very disappointed."
3,Keeps them busy.,"Ordered 2 and recieved 2 different ones , which was great. Not to small or large , but just right for kids hands."
5,its just what we needed,"Easy to use, reliable, and just what we needed to haul our mountain bikes on the Yakima racks! Very sturdy material."
5,it is an extension cord,"I don't know what you expect from the world, this is an extension cord. It does its job as an extension cord, i.e. extending the cord.-rPS: It didn't seem to experience signal loss.I'm writing this review because I like exercises in futility.-=-"
1,doesn't work,THis product does not work. It does not connect to my standard N64 controller. I need a replacement. SO until they replace it with one that fits I have to say this is terrible.
1,cargo mat,"This is a review for the cargo mat. This is the second one I purchased and it does not fit. I searched the make/model/year and trim of my vehicle and found the matching item on your web site but the mat is too big - I have a 2006 Jeep Cherokee with the 65th anniversary trim, the mat is too wide. It would be helpful if the item description contained width measurements! I didn't want try three times on ordering another mat---I am not a satisfied customer."
3,Didnt realize i would have to cut...though was able to...,Not sure if I didnt read the description well enough...I though this would come customized for my car...I had to cut along the lines and make it fit...I was able to do this but it was a bit confusing...A lot of money...would have looked for something that was truely made for my vehicle. Also wish it had come in grey.
5,Who says 13 is unlucky?,"Even though it may be volume 13 the good stuff keeps on coming! it all starts with Ryoga getting this crazy mark of the gods, that whenever someone charges him it triggers this involuntary spasm so that even Ranma is no match for him (GASP), but Ranma takes care of that! Then the little panty-stealing pervert Happosai *CRINGE* gets some new disciples (who thinks this won't end well)The next part is Ranma may just have a way to get rid of his curse, but it would mean a date with Kuno! Finally, never bet your life! If your a Ranma fan you'lle reheheheally be a fan of this book!"
2,Too much claptrap,"The book is a group of essays really on the world grid. Some are good, most are not. I thought the book failed to give a coherent account of the world grid and the demonstrable lack of precise alignments of important ceremonial sites with earth grid points. Besides the grid itself the book also did a very poor job of articulating how the grid might be used."
5,always be the greatest!,"wow mariah is great in this single, she is so great that i find that no one can really compare to her...buy this ! u won't regret!"
5,"The Best Track From ""Daydream""","While others would say it's ""Fantasy"" or ""One Sweet Day"", both much bigger hits, I think, while those were both great songs and prime examples of Mariah's talent, ""Always Be My Baby"" is the best song here - a mix between a pop ballad, R&B, soul and it sounds great. Mariah's black heritage shines here - you could compare her to Dian Ross or Aretha. The melody is soft and sweeping, laid back and soothing. It's such a nice song. Mariah Carey used to be my all-time favorite musical star in the early 90's until she got blown WAY out of proportion and got too commercial (around 1993)."
4,Great Song,"Always Be My Baby will always be one of my favorite Mariah Carey songs. It's such a positive song about breaking up, and not giving up on the fact that the person will be back if they truly were meant to be. The remixes are pretty good too, although I didn't care for the Reggae mix. If you want one of the best remixes of this song, try and find the import of this single with the Morales Mix, it is the bomb!"
5,Search Hard To Find The Right Single With Unreleased Track,"This cd single is very worth buying. The remix tracks certainly give a customer/fan the incentive to purchase it. If you get the chance be sure to get the Always Be My Baby single that has the unreleased track ""SLIPPING AWAY"". It is a rare treasure. The track is also found on the aussie import cd single for the song ""Open Arms"" which also contains a version of Open Arms sung in Spanish."
5,Mariah's BEST?,"Many people consider ""Always Be My Baby"" Mariah's best song... So why don't you buy this and find out for yourself... There are some awesome remixes on this Maxi single. ""Always Be My Baby,"" isn't my favorite Mariah Carey song, but it's on of my favorites! Great song by the GREATEST artist... Buy it now!"
4,OKAY,"The remixes are very cool but the no rap radio mix and the extended mix are pretty much the same. Towards the end of the radio mix, it turns into the Mr. Dupri mix without rap by Da Brat. In the extended mix Da Brat raps in the beginning of the song, so there's no rap in that remix either. The Reggae Soul mix is very funny and Lil' Vicious cracks me up with that crazy rap! I also have the Cassete Single, here are the tracks: Side 1: 1. Album Version 2. Mr. Dupri mix featuring Da Brat & Xscape Side 2: 1. Slipping Away (Very cool song!)Also, I couldn't really hear Xscape in the remixes they were in."
4,Well worth a listen - it's hitorical!,"It's always nice to listen to previous music styles and `Swing' is still something that is regularly played today, albeit mostly on radio as most of the big bands have unfortunately gone, though the Glen Miller band still tour the UK regularly.Swing came to prominence in the 1930's in America and stayed around until the early 50's. Although it was of black American origin it was immensely popular in the dancing eras of its time, both here and in the States. Its jazzy style still sounds very listenable today although unfortunately it seems far too expensive for large bands to tour the theatres and dance halls. Perhaps one day it will be revived and set a new fashion trend for the modern day dancers and clubbers.All the old classics are on here as are all the top bands of that era. This is well worth an hour of anyone's time. It's part of our history!"
1,Waste of money,Dont buy this product it was crap and a waste of money..you would do better to go to walmart and buy something similar..
5,Not just for harmonica fans!,"I bought this out of curiousity as I collect music from 1920-1939 and I am glad that I did. Adler was not some corny, tasteless performer inflicting ""Lady from Spain"" on the listener. This guy was a superb musician with good taste who really tweaks these great standards from the thirties and gives them a new twist. Enjoyable arrangements with small and large orchestras. Well worth having."
1,Conversing on a subject while lacking knowledge,"This book was written by a professor of Japanese culture and literature. She herself admits that she was not familiar to anime and manga before being introduced to it by a student. This shows, as the author makes many comparisons between series that are not compatible in order to draw out conclusions that seem forced. When I read of ""Akira"" being compared to ""Ranma 1/2"" and see that the supposed underlying theme is the alienation of Japanese youth, something about the text seems to smell. When she begins making slapstick comedy series out to be psychological commentaries on the concept of ""carnival,"" I find myself becoming sceptical about how much she understands the medium of anime. My overall perception of this book is not that she explains anime to the reader, but that she uses specific elements in anime to prove the preconceived points she wishes to get across. This is not the worst book about anime, but it is pretty close to it."
3,"Not Great, But Not Horrible","Previous reviewers have gotten it right--Napier's book reads more like a college thesis than a definitive guide to anime. She gets carried away with the philosophy and psychology at times, to the point of Freudian symbology (i.e. San's costume in ""Princess Mononoke"" being symbolic of female genitalia). Occasionally, the reader might find themselves begging Ms. Napier to just relax and enjoy ""Ranma"" for the zaniness that it is.However, there are some good aspects. Her analysis of ""Evangelion"" shows a great deal of depth of knowledge of the subject, and I found her comparing it with the ""cultural shock"" of Japan following WWII very interesting. Also, her ability to place series in context with Japanese history, symbology, and philosophy is helpful to fans who want to really get into their favorite series.On the whole, I would recommend this book for a thesis on anime, but not for newcomers or people looking for a simple review of a series."
2,"Sometimes interesting, but dense and slanted","As other reviewers have stated, this book is not really an overview of contemporary Japanese animation. Rather, it is a work of film criticism. Unfortunately, two problems mar what would otherwise be a halfway decent book. First, the author writes in dense, verbose academic style that often uses pages of text to say basically nothing (the entire first chapter is especially bad with respect to this information/verbiage ratio). The second problem is even more annoying, in that Napier seems to see all sociocultural issues through the extremely tinted lenses of ""political correctness"" melded with a simplistic and shallow form of feminism.If you're looking for a work on anime that will really give you an appreciation of the form along with a more in depth (and unslanted) look at the Japanese culture which created it, then I'd much sooner suggest Samurai from Outer Space : Understanding Japanese Animation by Antonia Levi."
4,Literary guide to Anime,"I actually had a college lit class that used anime text as the basis of the class. This book was the reference work that pointed out the literary merit of anime. Not only was I impressed that there was anime of literary merit, I was surprised by the depth of the popular works that she covered.Each chapter uses a popular Manga as the focus to explain a concept, bringing in additional references as needed. The book as actually very easy to read considering that the book really is about literary analysis.I learned a lot from this book, but it is not what I originally thought. When I first picked up the book, I would not have expected a literary analysis textbook. Make sure thats what you expect if you pick up the book because the title might seem more ""fun"" that it actually is."
5,Attractive and Functional,"I was given this same casserole as a wedding gift almost 25 years ago and I needed another one so I recently purchased this one on Amazon. I've used this casserole at home for special dinners, holidays and I've also used this casserole to carry dishes to parties or other dining events. It's very attractive and will hold a casserole or anything you would normally bake in a 2qt. casserole dish. It will need polishing every now and then and since it's silver-plated, don't use anything that will scratch it or remove the plating. Store it in a box with with tissue paper to help retard tarnishing between uses if you don't like to polish on a regular basis."
2,New Orleans?,"I must admit that I picked up this book because it was written in New Orleans, and I love to read books in that setting. The fact that it was a forensic mystery was, I thought, a bonus, since I love forensic mysteries. Well, this book did disappoint me in all aspects. There is very little New Orleans flavour to the book at all, and the forensic information was extremely minimal. Not only that, but it wasn't even an exciting mystery. The character development was extremly weak.I did not enjoy this book and did not find it exciting to read. If you're looking for good forensics, try Kathy Reichs."
5,The Presidents are the best band in the whole world,This CD is out of stock and I am angry because I cannot find it anywhere. Could somebody please sell me all of the presidents singles. If amazon doe not have these cd's then who will. I am going insane.
5,They are so good it hurts,"My friend dave has this cd and I love it only I cannot find it anywhere. The Presidents are my favorite band because there music is fun, original, and just plain good. Every song on this album is worth listening to several times."
2,Essential for who?,"This book is the ""official authorized guide"" to the world of 007. It's just a pity that the authors are obviously not real Bond fans. The book casually glides past Fleming;s novels and the Bonds themselves and instead does a film-by-film recap. This would be nice were it not for the fact that you often get the sense that the authors were trying to divide Bond fans into 2 distinct camps rather than prasing the series as a whole. My personal tastes were also insulted as brilliant movies like ""man With The Golden Gun"" and ""A View To A Kill"" are slammed, mocked, and scorned, while later on they gush and sing the praises of the dull villain Carver from ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", and stop just short of calling George Lazenby the best Bond ever. I couldn't help getting a sense that this book was written to be deliberatley provocative and irritating, and really that's not what you want in a book called ""The Essential Bond""."
5,The Essential Guide to Bond,"""The Essential Bond"" is probably the best general reference work available today on the world of everyone's favorite cinema spy. Authors Lee Pfeiffer and Dave Worrall, long-established experts in the field of Bondage, have assembled an impressive array of previously unpublished photos (from the ""Eon Archives""), as well as comprehensive data on every villain, Bond Girl, gadget, car, and weapon. They have also included thoughtful chapters on the Literary Bond (which should never be neglected), the members of the ""Bond Family,"" 007 and Popular Culture, and more. And lest anyone think this is (or wrongfully accuse the authors of writing) a ""love letter"" to Eon Productions (producers of the 20-film Bond franchise since 1962), P & W have included insightful, often highly-critical analyses of each film in the official Bond canon. If you buy only one book on James Bond, let this be the one."
5,Steven Seagal plus Russian Mob against Chinese = Killing,"I'm a big huge fan of Steven Seagal. I mean I had all his movies (maybe I have some that He does not have in his own collection). Steven Seagal is at the wrong place at the wrong time and for that He is going to kill a lot of people. This movie is full of killing and action. Any action movie fan should see this. I really enjoyed. Actually the movie makes sense and is really good. The last movies of Steven Seagal were really bad, but this one and The keeper are getting our action hero back in the field. If you like Steven Seagal you should buy it. You won't regret."
4,Great Action,"The new action flick from Mr. Seagal "" a Dangerous Man "" contains all you can expect from a great action movie . Seagal did it again , he is gettin older , yes ( We all do ) , and hes is gettin more violent and mean . COOL MOVIE . Keep on Steven , give us more entertainment please ."
2,Dangerously Strange,I did not really like A Dangerous Man very much and the script just did not seem like a good fit for Seagal. The movie started out ok then got a little confusing and strange I thought. Probably worth a watch for the average Seagal fan.Peter J. Miller
2,Fat and Old,"Sorry, but Steve needs to hit Weight Watchers and drop 50 pounds. Very unrealistic for a man his age and size, but Seagal fans will overlook this, no doubt. Save your $$$$."
4,First Louis Amstrong CD,"If you are going to buy only one CD from Amstrong, this is the one I suggest."
3,"It is indeed a teacup, yet no saucer...","This teacup serves it's purpose of holding tea and allowing you to drink tea from it in an English manner, yet this product does not include the saucer. I was disappointed when I opened my package and discovered no saucer, despite there being a picture of a saucer in the product image.I now have to enjoy my afternoon tea like a commoner."
4,"Nice set, but...","This is a very nice item. My only complaint is that it is available only as a set that includes right and left handed models. Whether you are right or left handed, one is going to sit in a drawer. I would have preferred to be able to buy two of the one I needed."
1,Junk,Humidifiers that require filter changes are junk and so are the filters required. This filter literally fell apart very soon after putting it in the unit.
3,re-recordings,... these are re-recordings of the Varukers' songs... the songs stand up but I'd much rather hear the original recordings.
4,Civil war curiosities,This book was ordered as a Christmas gift for a friend. He is interested in the Civil war and reads all the information he can get his hands on.
3,Civil War Oddities,"Have recently gotten into reading about the Civil War and thought I would give this one a try. It was pretty interesting but I thought it would have more longer stories about the war curiosities and oddities. On the contrary, it has chapters about certain topics, example ""Strange Weapons of the War"", and within that chapter there might be 25 to 40 short paragraphs about different types of guns, cannons, or bayonetes that never made an impact on the outcome of the war. While these short paragraphs are interesting, there isn't much substance to them - just short snippets of information. That said, they are interesting but guess I was wanting a little more depth to the stories. I would recommend you give it a try - you might like it..."
3,Difficult to Close,"I used one of these for cat food storage for about 2 years. Once you get them closed they are great, nothing is getting into these things. However my husband and I always had difficulty getting it to properly snap closed. We now use it to store some random supplies in the garage."
5,Great alternative!,I bought this container wanting to replace the bag the dog food came in. It's sits perfectly on the floor and is high enough where you don't need to kneel down to grab the food. I does seal perfectly to preserve the food. Great product and value!
2,Lid doesnt shut right,Overall the product is okay but the lid does not easily close. You have to push really hard to get it to stay and it usually pops back open anyway!!
1,Storage for the Storage,Where was this dog food storage container stored? I received an absolutely filthy unit which required major scrubbing instead of the usual cleaning that you would expect. It is also more cumbersome to use that I expected.
5,Teacher's Survival Resource,"Several things that I wanted to know before I purchased the product were to get a glimspe of the table of contents, a peek of any page, description or phrase that its a recommeded book for teachers with teaching experience of 1-4 years or so."
5,The English Teacher's Survival Guide,I really enjoy all the templates included in this book. It provides many templates that help the classroom run smoothly.
4,Good product,"I recommend that you buy this product. You can decide for yourself or you can listen to me. It's your choice. Don't blame me for buying it. It would help you, I think. It's better to have many ideas instead of one, that's my idea."
3,Better options available,"While I did get a few ideas from this book, it quickly went into the dark abyss of my classroom cabinet as I found several other titles more helpful/relevant/usable."
4,Great for Brand New English Teachers,I had imagined that there would be more reproducibles in this book. That was my only disappointment. It's more of a how-to guide to the many aspects of teaching English.
2,Why?,"The album was called Victory and it was put out by Epic in 1984. Also in 1984, Epic discovered that the album wasn't wasn't true to its name so they pulled it from the shelves. The fifth track is ""State of Shock"" which is how you felt after discovering that you paid $ for this puppy in 1984. The first track is called ""Torture"" and believe me, IT IS! The third track is called ""One More Chance"", this is how many chances that you gave Michael to redeem himself. The seventh song is called ""The Hurt"", this is what this album puts on you after a complete listening."
5,Torture,"It was torture to my ears...but I liked the way Jermaine got to lead for a change, he is my favourite Jackson by far - Gill"
4,One more chance for me to wax nostalgia.,"Amazon's info on this product suggests that it was remastered, yet what I received is the original CD pressing from the 80's. Not that the sound is bad, but a good remastering is needed to bring it up to its full dynamic potential, at least on CD. It's a great album that brings back lots of nostalgic memories of my childhood. A great trip down memory lane!"
3,sorry did'nt like this in 84 or now,state of shock was a smash it features mike with mick jagger plus mj was still enjoying the fruits and labors off thriller that was cool but the titkle song weas a smash mike onmly has a few lines jermaine sings the lead but to all jacksons fans it's a must have.
2,Mighty Weak Stuff,"Oh how the mighty had fallen. In the wake of the Michealmania of 1983-84 came this bust with the once-great J-5, whose album withered on the vine in the wake of Prince's Purple rain that summer. ""State of Shock"" will put you in just that, an atrocious mix of Michael Jackson and Mick Jagger that goes together like fire and water. ""One More Chance"" is okay, but nothing special, as is the case with ""Body"" and ""Torture."" However, it does have a shining moment with the lively and bouncy ""Wait,"" which is easily the best thing on the album. Other than that, if you need a good frisbee......."
3,Correction...,"I do not have this album because it appears to be the weakest of the Jacksons' work but I had to respond to some rather egregiously incorrect comments.First of all, State of Shock is a good song in my opinion. It has a very distinctive sound which is loose and fun to listen to.Secondly, Michael did do victory as a favor to his brothers although he wanted to work on his solo career. The Jacksons wanted Michael on the album so they could capitalize on the success of his Thriller album. Michael was pressured to do it. It was in fact Michael who put a stop to all of this at the end of the Victory tour.Thirdly, Michael was not the only one who was not in the Torture video. Jermaine, the other lead vocalist on the song, did not appear either. As a side note, the song was just okay (at least in my opinion).Triumph and Destiny are really good albums if you are looking for Jacksons material."
4,classic !!!!!!,"this was the last album to feature all six brothers working together after always being a quintet and it is off the hook.it also showcases the talents of the other brothers instead of just focusing on the gloved one. Randy's ""one more chance"", Jackie's ""wait"" (check out the ad-libs by michael and jermaine) and Marlon's ""body"" are the three phat cuts that truly makes the album an authentic family affair instead of a michael jackson show. If it wasn't for the unity they had in the beginning, michael would've never became a standout. his contribution ""be not always"" is also one of his great performances on wax.Jermaine and Tito should have played their instruments instead of using mostly studio musicians for this album. another classic cut is ""torture"" showing michael and jermaine teaming up on a song like their motown days.pick this album up and see why their forthcoming album is going to be monumental."
3,alright,"torture,wait,one more chance &the hurt stand out. randy jackson is showcased rather well on this disc. he&michael always made a strong song-writing duo. but vocally on the disc no one matches michael."
5,Very good album,"This is a very nice album, must have for all MJ fans. It has one song Michael sings, which is particularly beautiful, Michael's heavenly voice comes there in full force. The songs by other Jacksons were very good, too, makes me want to explore their own work more."
3,"Not the best Jackson Album, but not bad","This album was the LAST Jackson album with the 6 Jackson brothers together, off course to include Michael. It has some great tracks. Give it a listen."
4,Mike shares the stage,"Victory is the first Jacksons album to truly show the talents of the other brothers. Randy, who co-wrote many of the groups best songs (""see ""Things I Do For You"", ""Lovely One"" and ""Shake Your Body""Don't miss the harmony and vocals of Jermaine on torture."
4,"Jackie, Marlon, Tito, Randy, Jermaine and Michael","Alot of Jacksons fans don't care for this album. I've been listening to it for about a year, and I actually love this album. I also own Destiny, Triumph, Goin' Places, and 2300 Jackson Street, so I know what there other albums sounded like. Most jacksons fans want to hear Michael and maybe Jermaine on leads and that's it. I love this album because It proves that the other members aren't dead weight. Everyone gets a song to lead execept Jermaine, but he co-leads torture, and ad-libs at the end of Wait with Michael(best part of the song.) What keeps this from being 5 stars is some of the backing being cheesy,(but not as bad as you think) and the brothers not playing their instruments more. Definetely recommended."
2,"Smell fades in less than an hour, synthetic smell to it","Not at all happy with this product. The only way the smell stays is if you spray it a bunch on your shirt, etc.. and then only that one spot gives off the scent (not like cologne/perfume where the scent carriers)."
3,Great scent that doesn't last,"The scent was amazing and absolutely as described. The problem is that it doesn't last very long at all. I ended up using an entire bottle in about a week. If the scent lasted, I would give this product a perfect rating."
1,got the wrong item,Well the price was good but we got the wrong thing. And the one we got smells like dirty water.
5,Life's Lessons,"""How is it, I wondered, that obstacles that appear so daunting often turn out to be easy, while the unnamed threats do us in?"" (From Chapter 12, ""The Chatooga, Revisited."")I enjoyed reading John Manuel's memoir, The Canoeist, for its white-knuckle descriptions of river adventures, and for its exploration of the friendships that develop among diverse personalities out together battling the elements. But I also found, in the process of moving from chapter to chapter, reflections of life's journeys and hazards, the ""unnamed threats"" that can do us in. I like the way he weaves the story lines of his most important relationships in and out of the sequence of river chapters. A good read!"
1,Dangerous and Expensive,"I was wondering why I just didn't feel well after a night of using my humidifier with this product in it. I'd wake up feeling like I had bad allergies or a cold (head stuffed, nose clogged and a general, tired feeling). Plus, I don't understand why this company charges so much. It costs $6.99 in stores and on other websites. I think a drop or two of Calgon water softener might prove safer than this toxic product."
3,Not sure if this is for my cool air filter....,Wanted to purchase to ensure quality of water/air coming out of unit for my baby. I only used one capful for the VICKS cool air humidifier. Read somewhere that this product is more for the wick units (the ones that use that honeycomb filter looking thing). It left a white powder residue so I will not use again with baby; not sure if it is toxic. I will use that little ball thing instead and clean unit more often.
1,Opt for something safer,"I was bit hesitant about using this product with all the warnings on the label. It is bad for your eyes, skin, and lungs?So why would you want to put it in a humidifier? Well that said, I used it for two days and had minor chest pains and headaches.I had burning sensations in both nostrils. I would not recommend this product and opt for something with less chemicals. Its pretty bad stuff."
3,Different formula--no sanitizer,"They used to sell a combination water treatment and bacteriastat--this is just the treatment to keep scale and lime deposits from forming. I guess they figured they could make more money selling the two separately but since you have to fill up a humidifer daily, it's a pain to put a capful of BOTH solutions in there."
1,toxic?,Gave me a headache after 5 minutes of use. Not sure why but I think it's from dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride
3,OK I guess,"Does not keep lime scale off warm mist humidifiers...well, it seems to help, but not much. I've been using this a long time for borderline hard water and I'm afraid that without something, the humidifiers would die within a week or 2, instead of a year or 2.With the newer Vicks Humidifier it seems to help a bit better. Although the Vicks has those little scale-absorbing pads too.Guess you just have to try it for yourself...sorry."
4,Good Product,"It helps to keep the minerals down to a lower level in your humidifier so that the parts don't calcify as quickly as they would otherwise. I've used the product for three years with good results. I still have a mineral build up, but we live in an area that has very hard water and I expect those results. I think you'll like it."
5,"works great, every time","I have been using this poduct in my humidifier for six years. I live in a semi-arid climate and run my humidifier for at least eight hours, every single day. I have never had a single problem with algae, mold, or bacteria overgrowth."
5,Chuck Key,"I managed to lose my chuck key in the yard while repairing a fence. Ordered a replacement that evening for Makita and very quickly it arrived, before I needed to use the cordless drive motor again. I appreciate how responsive the seller was in completing my order and the availability of replacement parts from Makita."
1,Does NOT play in American DVD players.,This item does not play in North American DvD players. It is only for Regions 2-6. This Fact is Not Clearly marked so that Buyers will Know.:-(
1,Finger away!!!! Attention fraud!!! Blu-ray only,"Finger away!!!! Attention fraud!!! This disk is fraud. With camera trips strong picture leaps arise. The photographs are not in 24p 50i, 60i, 60p. Unfortunate, the image definition is enormously, only with this picture leaps must one hand itself over. Def records apparent employ only blind laymen. From this label I will never buy again something."
2,not that good.,"music sounds good, but the direction is not very good. this is a concert video not a music video."
2,Poor sound and pic,"Its not DTS Master audio.I am really disappointed because its sounds and looks like a reg dvd, not a blu-ray.Dont wast your money on blu-ray."
4,Great performance,This concert is very entertaining. Not long but I prefer that. This is definitely the old Rihanna. Fun and not depressing.
1,Boring....,"Take away the flash, the makeup, the scandal, and everything 'around' Rihanna, and you are left with...well...not much.The music is fake.Good Girl Gone Bad Live is one heck of a boring set of songs."
5,Great Dvd,"If you like Rihanna in the least, you'll enjoy this dvd, she looks amazing in the concert dvd.. I enjoyed it. She just knows how to perform.."
4,Good Deal,Got that book for a real good price even when it looked much more used than described. Nevertheless good qulity for such a price.
3,A Bathroom Book All The Way.,"Definitely a light read. A few items are either incorrect or misleading; but for the most part, a relatively entertaining book. Written in the light, easily digestible style of any good ""bathroom reader."""
3,A decent read,"I expected a book that just gave a bunch of examples of dumb stuff that rock stars have done. Which is what the title suggested. Actually it separates out only a few bands and rock stars then gives their stats and basically is just a list of dumb quotes and some dumb things that that particular person or band has done. Some of the stuff wasn't even dumb. It was just facts. It was a decent read, but don't expect any spectacular revelations."
5,I laughed until my face hurt!,"This is a great book. Not only is it funny, but it'd be a terrific gift for anyone you know who loves a good laugh. The quotes alone are worth getting it for."
3,"Interesting, but gets a bit tedious","The theme here is drugs meshed with money. For almost all the ""rockers"" drugs are mentioned. Moser and Crawford have an array of musicians from Spinal tap to madonna and list birth dates, places of birth, some hit songs and films if applicable, dumb quotes and idiotic things they have done. I have to wonder about the authenticity of alot of the things, but then again money can be poison. It isnt a book for teens there is alot of sex, violence and drugs. It can be interesting, albeit embarassing for those listed. If there isnt a thing better to read, give it a whirl."
1,Authors Do the Dumbest Things!,"Margaret Moser and Bill Crawford live in fantasy land? What a waste of money. Obviously these two clowns have not done any proper research and have filled the book with lots of myths and wildly exaggerated stories. I'm particularly peeved with the Keith Moon stuff, complete rubbish. Keith's antics have been well researched by other people and what these two have used are stories that are well known to be grossly exaggerated. They have basicly taken the most stupid myths and exaggerated stories from other peoples work, put in no research, and expect people to buy it. I wish I hadn't!! Save your money."
5,muy taco,"Item recrived as advertised. Prompt shipping, and great customer service. Would not hesitate to purchase from Ultimate Paintball again."
5,A Classic Study,"Nancy K. Miller is best known for The Heroine's Text: Readings in the French and English Novel, 1722-1782, which is clearly not a book that passes unperceived (to paraphrase Peter Brooks of Yale). Here Miller takes on the role of women with her trademark unsentimental criticism. Her style is terse, often funny, and readable. After a thorough linear analysis of a narrative sequence, she discusses the ideological consequence of the novel. Because she doesn't have an axe to grind, her critiques cannot be dismissed as ""feminist"" but rather bring added depth to the study of the novel."
4,"Not just what, but why and how","The DVD effectively explains how to use the camera. The narrator's analogy to the manual found in the glove compartment of a car is true. You can't learn how to drive from that car manual -- and you can't learn how to use the camera from the manual that comes with it. The DVD explains how, why, when, and where to use the difernet features of the camera."
4,Helpful book I think.,"This is a good book to have, but the narrator talks so fast I have a hard time keeping up.Maybe it's because I am 87 years old. I will keep looking at this DVD until I do understand.Thank you for the great service. It arrived in good order."
4,but what does that have to do with david bowie?,"Dude, I mean, like, Dostoevsky's poetics have, like, lossa problems man. I mean, like, what's the deal with that Marmaledov dude? Is he related to Ziggy or something? I don't get it man. It's all voodoo to me. But it's a good read, I mean, making love with his ego is such an, ahhhh, maybe I should keep this to myself. But I really dig that stuff about the landlady and the axe, that was inspirational, metatarsal, trippy dude. Whatever."
2,More photos,With a book about glass and jewelry made by Tiffany more photos are needed to make this a wow book!
3,The picture it misleading..,"You get a small vile of the product. It's a bit clumped up, but it makes green water for feeding your shrimp. I think I would go with a different option next time."
1,Exceptionally poor support for platform bed,"Perhaps this bed will work with boxes under mattress, but it is marketed as platform bed. I purchased it with the purpose of using it without boxes, by placing mattress directly on the slats. The support is constructed very poorly. The one middle support beam has same thickness as the rest of the slats and is not attached neither to headboard nor foot-board of the frame. It is attached to few slats by bolts, and is supported by two legs. It gets easily bend on the edges, and bed is making a lot of creaking noises. I tried reassembling the bed few times, even tried to use beeswax to prevent the noise, but nothing helps.For this money I would expect sturdier construction, with heavier beam attached to the bed frame itself, with more support legs.Amazon return service was good though, but beware of the shipping charge. There's $90 shipping charge that you end up paying, even if you are Prime customer, to send it back."
2,Only fair,"While this collection does work with the author's cruising guide, it in no way replaces the need for the actual charts. I had hoped the author would have applied a consistent format in terms of depth coloring, lat/lon demarcation and Loran lines. All are variable from page to page. Compass roses are not consistently avaialable. The large scale chart showing the location of the individual pages is not clear and does not even show the first few pages at all. The volume I bought had 8 pages inverted, further adding to the difficulty. My advice is pass on this edition."
2,Of limited value,"While useful for armchair sailing, it is no substitute for the appropriate charts. It's really an attempt to bridge the gap between a Rand McNally map and NOAA charts, which I guess it does, but it has no really good use on board. Buy the charts."
3,Coastal NOAA Charts for Cruising Guide to Western Florida,"We have found the charts difficult to use because there is very little overview. Being unfamiliar with the waters, and planning a cruise, we would like a page that includes landmarks by name that would help guide us to the right chart. The zoom in charts are unclear, and there are not enough zooms that are logically arranged and easy to follow. We are used to using Richardson's and MapTech chart books and found this disappointing."
2,Very ordinary,"Waste of money. Music is OK, but video is silly. Save your money. Do this instead: 1. download royalty free art and space .jpgs, 2. load them into powerpoint and set slide timing for 25 seconds per slide. 3. while playing the powerpoint show, listen to Pandora.com set to an ambient station of your choice. You've got the EXACT same thing, but at better graphics resolution."
5,Electronica in Surround!,"From start to finish, this album gives me much pleasure on an almost daily basis.If I need to start the day feeling uplifted, energized, amused or even relaxed, I can chose many of the tracks and have my mood tended to by this (somewhat) eclectic mix of electronic sounds. The album has been compiled cleverly and each track merges into the next seamlessly. You will all recognise a few of the tracks and I'm sure the tracks which are new to you will become favourites.I will let you decide which tracks work for you best, as we all know each person's musical tastes vary tremendously. But mark my words, if you enjoy dancey beats and surround sound, this album will not disappoint you! I hope you agree!"
5,Works great! Very pleased so far.,"I was concerned about getting a tandem on the roof of my Honda Pilot SUV, but this rack works very well. See the 2 pictures I uploaded."
2,A Moan for this Moen Faucet,"I ordered the Moen #87581 kitchen faucet for parts, no longer available separately. Unfortunately, I was sent a different Moen faucet, similar, but with components not matching the faucet I ordered. Kind of hard to rate this experience positively."
5,The Incomparable Hildegarde!,"It's funny how I know Hildegarde now that she has been gone for almost 3 years. Hildegarde was the leading first lady or queen or Dame of the Cabaret circuit. Anybody else who followed her had a tough act to follow. The voice is stunning, smooth as silk, and it would be wonderful to see her in a recorded video or film of her singing voice with gloves and fantastical outfits with long gowns, hats, gloves, etc. We don't have anybody close to match Hildegarde's power as a leading cabaret singer. When you listen to her, you just feel like dancing or in a better place. I just can't believe that I never heard of Hildegarde until now. I wished that I knew her then. This compilation is her original mono recordings from 1935 to 1944 with big bands like BBC Dance ORchestra, Carroll Gibbons and his Boy Friends, Mantovani, etc. Hildegarde will always be remembered because of her contributions to the art of cabaret singing where it's intimate atmosphere."
4,good costume for my 8 year old,"This costume is exactly what I expected, and it looks great. It is not too flimsy. I think the headband is a tad bit short, so we might have to improvise, but the rest of it is fine."
5,Rythym Tech Tambourine Makes A Nice Sound,The Rhythm Tech Tambourine has a nice sound. It is easy to maneuver. It can jingle softly or louder at different intervals of usage. Tambourines have come along way since the 60's. This one has a nice soft hand grip. It comes in a variety of colors. I like the purple. I have been playing a tambourine all of my life--was in a band years ago. I recently donated the tambourine to my church ministry team. It is a nice gift.
3,Beware! No Answer Key,"Warning, Hebrew learners who buy this book! The most egregious drawback concerning this book is that there is no answer key. Therefore, we have no way of checking our work or measuring any progress. The learner is completely left in the dark as to whether his/her answers in the exercises are correct or not."
5,My favorite.,"I bought these for my youngest grandchildren, age 4. These were my favorite books as a child. Every time I went to the library, these were the books that I brought home. I was so happy to be able to purchase them."
5,great purchase,"portable DVD player + Mickey Mouse Clubhouse = 30 minutes of distraction for 2 year old each morning of our cruise, which was just enough to get organized and out of the cabin for the day. Definitely worth it."
5,watched a million times already!,"It is great my 2 year old has watched it a million times already!! Have paid more for others in the store, so great value."
1,Terrible! I Hate It!!,"It's buy far the worst show with Mickey Mouse! It's very disgraceful to the mouse we all know and love! Mickey and his friends acts more like Dora (which I hate that show to), the plots are lasy written, and there's no good humor for adults on this show! It also lacks creativity on the learning part and it's very bad! Why did they ruin the mouse and his friends?! Why?!?! These are my favorite characters from my childhood and it wasn't a good idea to make a show where Mickey just talks to you on the camera oftenly! There's nothing new to the show, It's a rip-off of other shows that we've already seen before, like Dora the Exploror and the Elmo's World segments at the end of each Sesame Street episode! TRUCK YOU DISNEY! TRUCK YOU!!!"
1,bad buy,"Dvd won't play... I guess thats what happened buying a used product. Sometimes you have luck & sometimes you wont. This one is a piece of junk, wasting my money. Never again.."
5,Quiet time!,"It's a great video to keep a child, 2 years old quiet for a while and at the same time learns from it."
4,Very similar to other Mickey Mouse Clubhouse titles,"My kids love Mickey Mouse Clubhouse in all its glory. They wanted to watch this one for a week straight whenever they had a chance. I enjoy this show, it doesn't grate my nerves like some other kids shows do and the kids seem to learn from it and enjoy it. If you like Mickey Mouse Clubhouse definitely add this to your collection, if you're new to the show I'd recommend giving it a try."
5,Love it!,This video keeps the baby entertained for a long time. He loves it and that makes me very happy I bought it.
4,Love Mickey! Love Disney!,"We bought this DVD for use in the car. Very entertaining. Holds the girls' interest every time. I recommend this and most of the other Mickey Mouse Clubhouse DVDs. When we are in the car, these DVDs are a must have for a peaceful, happy trip!"
5,How to Be a Happy Medium,"This was a very well written book. I enjoyed the easy step by step directions on learning to connect with the spritual world. The book is not written in a ""mystifying"" fashion, rather a rational explanation of all the questions you might have when actually visiting with a medium . Further, the reader is encouraged to open themselves to learn more about themselves and their own spirituality."
1,Don't buy this table!,"I ordered this table from Target and it arrived with several huge cracks in the place where you attach the legs. I sent it back and the 2nd table has a big crack and other blemishes on it, so I have to send it back; it has been a waste of time and money. I must say that Target's Customer service has been very nice and helpful, but I am not going to re-order this table and not sure if I will order any furnature from them."
3,Australian SF Reader,"Luddites in space. You would think that people that work in an asteroid belt wouldn't be anti-technology, but there you have it.However, this particular part of society is definitely in the 'if you have to take me apart to get there I don't want to go' camp.One of the leaders decides to cause a bit of trouble, and it is up to the protagonists, both human and machine, to stop him."
3,maybe good for MBA,"The book might be good for someone with MBA as a general review but definitelly not for someone preparing for quant job/interview.For that purpose ""Heard on the Street: Quantitative Questions from Wall Street Job Interviews"" is at least 100 times better."
3,Potentially Good But Spoiled by Errors,"Considering the academic qualifications of the author, I expected more from this book. I have a finance degree from the top undergrad business program and bought this book to review some topics for an interview. There are some places where the author's explanation takes a leap that is simply hard to follow. In some example problems she works out, there are major errors as the math gets worked out, which ruin the lesson. Because this book is an overview of important finance topics, each example problem is that much more important to the learning value. The errors make it hard to put faith in this book. Hopefully these errors get corrected in future versions, as I feel this book has the potential to be a very good tool."
2,"Terrible Editing, has mistakes, still useful","I learned some stuff from this book so I don't regret checking it out from our library.But the editing is just terrible for a book going out to print. Undergrad project reports are better structured than this book. Lots of typos, editing issues, blocks of white pages, etc. -> NonprofessionalAlso at least once I noticed a deep conceptual mistake. (Working in risk neutral measure, and using mu, the risky return of a stock? That's unforgivable!)"
3,"Adorable, but not perfect","I love the look of this kettle, and I love the size. It's just big enough to make 2 mugs of coffee/tea. However, the handle does get hot, and I need to use a towel or something to pick up the hot kettle. It also gets a musty smell if I leave any bit of water in it after use. Being that I use it twice a day, that's kind of annoying. I just wash it frequently. Maybe it's because it's enameled? I never had this problem with stainless steel kettles. But, nothing bothered me enough to make me return it. There's also this tiny rust spot that looks like it's under the enamel, on the cover of the kettle, that I noticed after just a couple days."
3,If the tourist thing is your appeal buy this map.,"For a general map this is a very resourceful map. But for more detailed streets and more tram details this map could of definitely used. After traveling in brussels for a week, there are at least hundreds of streets this map needed to display. There were too many times my partner and I got lost. I find the Lonely planet series to be extremely helpful overall, and would look forward to the new edition of this map to be more descriptive."
2,Cheaply made,I couldn't believe how cheaply made this thing was! For the price you would think the pieces would fit together. Very disappointed.
4,Radio engineers handbook,Glad I found a copy of this classic. Well worth the price and a resource to have available. The seller was also very prompt in delviery. Very pleasing experience throughout.
3,Looks interesting,"just started reading it..looks interesting with medical related examples.I am not sure if there are examples in SPSS or any other software..haven't reached that far yet.Wish it was an e-book, would have been easier to carry around !"
2,Defective,"It took 2 people an hour to assemble the bed, at least two parts were defective, and after the back-breaking work we didn't feel it was worth the effort to disassemble and return it. I just hope it lasts for a month or two. I guess that's what you get for forty bucks!"
4,An O.k. TODDLER BED,"We bought this b/c of course my super-fanatic Dora fan needed an Dora bed to accompany her at night to sleep. We have had this over a year and my daughter quit sleeping in it B/C she likes her brother's Step 2 yellow car bed.. but up till then, she slept in this bed every night, and it really helped to get a bed that had a character she knew to transition from crib/mom & dad's bed to her own bed. This bed has also held up very well. we never have had any problems with it. i would recommend it to you if your daughter loves dora. Otherwise, i would go with a step 2 bed or somthing else just because those do generally hold up longer."
4,Good bed,"We just bought this bed for our 16 month old daughter and she LOVES it!! She has no problem climbing on or off the bed. However, like someone said in an earlier review.....our mattress is a tight fit too...it kind of bows the footboard out a little bit. And again.....our mattress isn't as thin as the one shown and because of that the rail is only a few inches above the mattress. But it hasn't been a problem yet and she seems to love it. It's a good bed for the money (we spent $30 for it)."
5,Cute bed...Will Serve it's purpose BUT......,"My mom gave this to my dauther for Christmas. The bed is so cute despite the bright pink color that I was worried about. She loves it but...she keeps falling out of it. If you have a good mattress this is not the toddler bed for you. It is a tight fit with our mattress which is the top of the line mattress that Babies R us sold. As in it is all I can do to the mattress back out to change the sheets. The other down side is that because the mattress is much better than the one shown on the bed in the picture, the rails only stick up about two inches.I had very little problems trying to put it together. The hardest part was getting the medal frame to fit inside the plastic head and foot board to screw it together. Needless to say I lost it after I smushed my finger between it. Other than that, it could be a great bed! My daughter loves Dora on it ofcourse."
2,Same problem as others,"We bought this bed for our daughter even after reading the reviews about the problems other people had...we hoped for the best. Unfortunately, we encountered the same problems of poorly designed pieces that did not fit together the way the manufacturer intended. The right bed guard will not stay attached. I guess you get what you pay for! It is a cute bed but just not worth the trouble."
1,"Cheap, Rickety, Very Dissapointing Bed",I was very tickled to find this bed this morning at a Toys R Us store. But when trying to assemble it I found the instructions confusing. None of the pieces are marked and the screws won't line up with the holes. The screws won't screw in straight resulting in a very rickety bed that has fallen apart. Now I am left with a pile of scratched up pieces and stripped out screws that I am taking back as soon as possible.
2,Not my cup of tea,"I'm a big time prog metal/prog rock fan, and I just didn't care for this album at all. The song structers were predictable, the lyrics were annoying and hypocritical and I just didn't care for the overused cliche concept of the devolution of mankind. If Britney Spears played prog metal with lyrics written by Al Gore, it would sound like this. There are plenty of better prog metal concept albums out there."
2,Not the typical Lee Smith humor and voice you expect,"For those familiar with Lee Smith's work, some of these stories seem very familiar, like rehashes of themes and ideas from some of her previous works. The mood of this collection is darker than her other collections and the stories seem disconnected. They do not engage the reader as so many of her works do. As a huge fan of Ms. Smith's, (I have read all her work), I was a little disappointed and left a little flat."
2,"Lots of words, no meaning","Reading the stories in this volume is entertaining, like watching TV. I don't have a TV. I read because I don't like TV. I read short stories because I often find sharp snapshots of crucial life moments.Not in News of the Spirit. I found elaborate images and scenarios that, having been created, are left to whither with no sense of life force. If you don't like to have your beliefs challenged, this is probably a good choice.If you're interested in exploring what we feel as we go through life, pick up a Kingsolver book."
3,"works, but lacks instructions...","This product worked, but I was mystified as to why it didn't come with directions. I gave the cats a dose per day for a week, problems resovled."
5,Much bigger than I anticipated,"I didn't realize just how little you need to use, so this actually dewormed an entire household of cats, plus my neighbour's dog, and I still have more than enough for any new adoptions. Great product, great price."
5,"Very Attractive, Very Practical","Great looking little crock. I received mine as a bonus with the purchase of the heart shaped 2 qt. sauce pot, and it's a very attractive serving piece.I made chili in the pot, and used the crock to bake a creamy cheese dip to spread on the corn chips/tortillas I served with the chili. The crock was just the right size for the dip, and the heart-shaped pot and crock made an attractive presentation."
1,"They changed the formula, not nearly as good","I have used this product for more than 10 years as an after shave balm. The soothing menthol, moisturizers and antiseptic properties made it an ideal aftershave. It was light enough (almost pourable) that it didn't go on heavy or leave a greasy shine. Unfortunately, they have reformulated and repackaged the product. The new product contains less per unit, costs more, and does not have the same properties. Per the ingredients listing, they have added gums to the formula, which makes it go on like a thick white cream. I'm not sure what the application for this product is now, but it definitely isn't as an aftershave balm."
3,Worship -,"I am a big fan of Vineyard worship and am a fan of several of the CD's in this set: Healing, Intimacy, & Father. I personally feel that real worship should be genuine and organic traits of which this album does not contain. The performance is very produced and canned."
5,Most unique anime,It's ethereal without being groundless. A real treat for the family to watch. The story lines are haunting and creative. It shows what the imagination is capable of if freed.
5,Beautiful stuff,"I'm really not much for anime, but there's something about the rich storylines and nuance behind Mushi-Shi that keeps me coming back for more."
5,Great show.,"Mushi-shi is great. Ginko the mushi master travels around studying mushi and helping people affected from encounters with the mushi. He's essentially Dr. House of turn of the century Japan. I refer to him as Dr.House because of the way he thinks outside the box in his treatment of the people afflicted and his desire to not harm the mushi when possible.There's no wackiness , robots , fan service or other usual anime stuff. There's just series of great stories that are very interesting and entertaining . The mushi themselves are as varied as any life form , everything from microscopic to enormous and all with different results with contact with humans. The show also does a really good job of making you get emotionally attached to the victims of the encounters, you really want these people to get cured.So if you want a good show to enjoy , then pick up Mushi-shi."
4,Video quality disappointing compared to original discs,"There are seven, rather than four, episodes per disc, and the extra video compression shows. The picture of the box set cannot compare to the original, individual releases. This is a shame, considering the care and artistry that was lavished on the series."
2,Size and weight are not up to snuff,"I am a medium framed person, but I ordered the large just in case they ran small. I thought, then, I'd just have to wash it to shrink it down. That wasn't the case at all This shirt is pretty flimsy and the large is more like a medium/small. That said, it looks decent and if you layer other shirts under it, you won't notice the wind coming through.I have received compliments about how it looks and so forth, but I do not wear the shirts often (I bought the grey and the blue ones). For the price I paid, I suppose I should not complain. I recommend buying these to wear in the early fall or during the mild spring months."
1,Mediocre at Best,"The book is antiquated with information that is complex and not essential. For example, shooting trap really boils down to stance, mount, balance, and see bird - shoot bird. Complicated angle diagrams and field layouts are not helpful in the least. While Missildine's writing is straightforward, he has omitted diagrams and a clear, concise presentation of the basics. The diagrams that are present within the book are confusing. If you want a truly helpful and complete book on wingshooting I would suggest Chris Batha's book, Breaking Clays."
5,Gospel sounds,Very uplifting Words of praise to help the spirit rejoice in the Lord And if you like lee William you will love this video .
3,Maybe would be great for beginning teachers,"I have been teaching for 3 years, and thought this book would be a great addition to my yoga library, something I could turn to for inspiration in my teaching.. However, while there are a few inspiring points in this book, the title of it is ""Guiding Yoga's Light: Yoga LESSONS for Yoga Teachers""--and I found the actual lessons to be very brief and lacking. But the topic of this book is a great idea, and I am glad someone has at least thought of the idea to write on this subject."
1,Bad business!!!,Disgusted!!! The flags I ordered were NOT sent. Instead I was sent flag designs that I already owned. GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT.
3,A Good Arrangement,"I'm not big on short mystery stories, mainly because the plot seems to be either way too thin to offer much intrigue, or way too complicated to be packed into a few thousand words. I was pleasantly surprised with Murder Most Crafty. Most of the stories were meaty enough to offer some level of speculation regarding ""whodunit,"" while not too complicated to follow. I found some old favorites, as well as some new authors to check out - and the craft projects were an added plus."
3,"Easily read, an excellent translation","I have to preface my review with the fact that I don't really like Confucius' underlying themes and messages. As a religon or a philosophy, Confucius tends to leave me unfulfilled.However, this translation by Arthur Waley and the introduction by Robert Wilkinson are excellent. Easily the best of the translations that I have seen, this book is a must have for any serious study of Confucius."
4,Not to be confused with Bert Hellinger's Family Constellations,"I bought this book by mistake - I thought it was about Hellinger's work. It was interesting nevertheless. Very easy to read, very simply formulated ideas. It almost seems it could be three times shorter, so those non-professionals of us can go straight to the sections that describe personality profiles and marriage profiles. Remember though that it was written in 1961, so it seems that a lot of information on ""typical"" family structure is outdated (% working mothers, % of divorces). Still, people remain the same and our early childhood experiences with siblings would of course shape our later relationships. Reading this book may not give you ultimate answer to life, universe and everything (no one theory does), but will likely help you understand your family and friends better - and that's always worth the time, right?"
2,Entertaining Factoids Without Conext or Sources,"If you're looking for a fast read on the plane or waiting room, this collection of odd news stories is good for entertainment. It is a collection of anecdotes with no connection or context and is designed to be read in little bites. The stories are not well sourced, and one wonders if they are accurate. But most readers won't be that concerned with this."
2,The Carrying Handle Failed Within A Week,"For such a nicely designed bag, it has a light weight and poorly attached carrying handle. I gave this to my son for Christmas this year, and within one week of light use (carried his laptop, notebook and a paperback), one side of the carrying handle ripped off. He can still use it with the shoulder strap, but this kind of workmanship is not up to the multiple other LowePro bags I use primarily for cameras.Thumbs down on this one."
5,Excellent price for flexible messenger bag,"I bought this messenger bag for $12 with shipping, so meeting my expectations wasn't difficult and this bag has done that. I have an ultraportable (Dell E4300), so I was looking for a smaller bag and this suits me nicely. It has quite a few small compartments for its size, including 2 zippered compartments for coins, etc., 2 compartments for phone/MP3/other devices, and room for notebooks or other not-too-bulky items besides the laptop. Two nice features for an inexpensive bag are a webbed drink holder and a stabilizer strap for load stability."
5,Great bag for biking,"I have been thoroughly satisfied with this messenger bag. I do use the extra strap when I bike. It snugly holds my 14.1 inch wide-screen laptop (Acer Aspire 4330).The only negative this I have to say about it is that the strap does not shorten as far I would like.Overall, this bag is easily worth the fifteen dollars I paid."
3,"Not for 15"" notebooks!","Description says, ""M Computer Bag--Fits Most 15.4-Inch Laptops..."".The tag on the product clearly states for 14"" notebooks. A 15"" notebook is such a squeeze- you'll look like a fool in front of people trying to make it go back into the bag!Change the product description!"
3,For the money - best bag you can buy,Summary - It's really a good bag for the money you'll pay. It's not the most sturdiest of the bags but gets the job done. I like that there's not a huge space to carry around junk. My last bag used be 20 lbs cuz it could carry stuff. Overall - i'll recommend this bag if you understand you're getting the best bag for the money but not the best bag.Good:- Light- Sturdy- Attractive design- CheapBad:- Limited Space- Limited compartmentalization (is this a word)- is not travel friendly. Can't tie it against to travel suitcase
4,A bag just works.,"This bag has two major compartments for laptop and notebooks/textbooks/papers. My 14 inch Thinkpad T61 can easily and safely fit into the padded laptop layer. The rest space is big enough for at least two 800 pages books (I won't encourage you to do so). However, this bag is like a spacious car with a small engine as its trap is a bit too narrow which makes it hard to carry too many heavy stuffs. My everyday load with this bag is:1 laptop + scratch papers + ~30 pages of reading papers.Besides the major function, this bag also has >10 smaller pockets for your iphone, flash memory key, badge, name card and so on, most of which I found really useful.I've been using this bag for >3 weeks. All my experience is positive. It's not an expensive fancy bag, but you can trust the name of Lowepro. They really know how to make a bag that works."
5,Perfect Bag,Lowepro Messenger Factor M Computer Bag--Fits Most 15.4-Inch Laptops (Black)Terrific bag. Fits my Dell XPS 1530 perfectly.
4,Great for the price.,"I bought it a month ago. Works pretty well for me. I can put my 15"" notebook without a problem. There is another pocket to put your AC power adapter, a mouse and some small items like cell phone, pens, notepads etc. It feels quite comfortable on my shoulder when loaded.The materials seem like in a good quality except the two plastic locking devices that keep the cover close. They are a little flimsy and seem that can break easily. If they break you cannot close the bag anymore because there is no zipper to close the inside pockets. Other than that it is a good buy for the low price. I like the black and orange color too, looks great."
3,"Decent bag, but did not fit my Dell","NOTE 11/17/09: This review no longer applies. This was originally written for their 15.4"" bag, but it somehow ended up here with a 14"" bag. Not sure what happened.I have a 15.4"" widescreen Dell Latitude D820, a fairly common business laptop, which doesn't fit in this bag (it's about half an inch too wide).Other than that, the bag seemed well-constructed except for the shoulder straps and top handle, which seemed rather narrow.On the positive side, the bag is lightweight, has a lot of pockets, looks pretty decent, has a cushioned back, and sturdy-looking zippers.I would've kept it if not for the size issue. Guess I had to learn the hard way that ""most"" doesn't mean ""all""."
5,Lowepro Messenger factor M computer bag,Awesome bag for the price. Does everything I need it to do..Lowepro is always well constructed.
5,A now forgotten crooner,"I am familiar with the works of Gene Austin for a number of years. All that had been available were scratchy old 78 rpm's. This digitally mastered CD eliminates the noise to reveal the smooth and easy ambiance that characterized his style and times. One the most popular crooners of the Jazz Age (Roaring Twenties), now largely forgotten. An excellent and rare find!"
4,Glad I found it,"Glad I was able to find this CD.Supposedly, my father was named for Gene Austin, but had never heard any music he recorded.Chose this CD because it had two of the songs that were reported to be favorites of my grandfather.I find it to be easy listening - taking me back to another time - and imagine grandparents ""courting"" to the music.I even ordered multiples for brothers and sisters so they could have same experience.As far as satisfaction with ordering, delivery, and condition - GREAT!"
4,Wild and Crazy!,"These guys are Wild, we need more of good times like this in todays music! Good old fashion fun and nobody gets hurt, well, maybe Hitler. Just a good time CD, enjoyed it a lot!"
5,need I say more?,I love fiesta ware. I LOOOOOOOVVVVVE it!I broke my gravy boat and could hardly wait to replace it with a new FIESTA WARE gravy boat.
4,Fiesta Uniquely American,This is my wife's present to our daughter. We have a lot of Fiesta which we enjoy so my wife thought our daughter would too. And she does.
4,fiesta ware,"I purchased this Fiesta Ware for my daughter, she was delighted.I bought several colors and it looks bright and cheery.Amazon was very fast and I had no trouble with the delivery.Price was also great."
5,Perfect with our Fiestaware,The beautiful scarlet color made a simple gravy boat really shine on our Thanksgiving table. An excellent alternative to the standard white and it cleaned up very easily in the dishwasher. Perfect size to serve enough gravy for nine people with a little room to spare.
4,No more spoons,This gravy boat is finely made and highly glazed. I don't think it will chip like some cheaper dinnerware. Used it for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it because they could take just the right amount of gravy.
5,The perfect gravy boat!,"I looked all over for a gravy boat - didn't know it was going to be so hard to find one, but this is great! Big and sturdy and doesn't drip all over. Arrived securely wrapped in bubble and in excellent condition. Would recommend this gravy boat, regardless of if you have Fiesta set or not (I don't but it still matches my set perfectly)."
4,Change in all types of organisations.,"Though the book is written for nonprofit organisations, it can be used by anyone studying the subject of change management or transitions. The role of the CEO as the chief change agent is critical in any change strategy. Chapter 3 & 4 clearly explains the importance. It is not just applicable to non-profit organisations; it applies to all organisations. Chapters on creativity and implementation are useful too as they offer some good suggestions. One thing I will find useful when I refer to this book in future is the summary at the end of each chapter. This is invaluable when you occasionally want to dip into a book in future to find a little 'nugget' of information"
4,I Don't Remember,"""Remember"" is one of the strongest and hardest songs on the 'Believe' album and aside from the title track, ish my favorite song. And this Single for it is one of the best! You can't beat the live version of ""Remember""."
5,THE BEST NOVEL FOR ALL AGES !,NINE LIVES AND THREE WISHES IS THE BEST FANASTY NOVEL EVER ! BELIEVE ME I HAD READ SEVERAL ! IT IS ABOUT CATS AND FAIRES - I WON'T SPOIL THE PLEASURE OF TELLING MOREEXCEPT THAT THIS NOVEL IS WONDERFUL FOR ALL AGES !!JBOOKFIEND@YAHOO.COM
3,Love the pattern; disappointed in the size,"I love Portmeirion and have many pieces of this pattern. Love the shape of this bowl. Was disappointed, however, in the SIZE of the bowl. In the description, it was stated that the width was 9.2"" inches, but it's not. It's about 8 3/4"" wide."
2,A Review for How to reach your favorite sports star,I got this book becaue I wanted more information on how to write some of my favorite figuer skaters and atheletes. We'll turns out the book was soo out dated. I thought it was the new one that just came out. I know more about tara then this d*** book does. It has wrong info and probaly does for the other atheletes also. Don't get it if you just want it cause Tara is on the cover it's a waste of money plus the info in it so WRONG!!!
5,an album you just gotta hear !,"Eric Clapton - Debut Album , Polydor Muisc, 1970 (Deluxe Edition)Here is another great example of where the wrong mix got pressed and issued to public (aka Klaatu's HOPE) and now you have the choice of the two versions in this Deluxe Edition. CD one is devoted to what i think most of us likely owned on vinyl ....the Tom Dowd mix while CD 2 showcases a very different mixed version by Delaney Bramlett. Each version sound nice and warm and have been well remastered and offer a very different view of this great firs solo album from Eric Clapton. The bonus tracks are excellent as well with an 11 min version of ""Blues In A"" and the psychy ""Teasin'""."
5,Excellent,"I'm happy to have a remixed version of this fine 1st solo project of one of the finest guitarists of all time. I do enjoy the horn enhanced mix from Delaney Bramlett included in this package and the original lyrics for the tune ""Let It Rain""."
1,Great Idea - Poor Research & Execution,"I happen to own the vinyl of ""Eric Clapton"" - The Delaney Bramlett mix (as it is now known). When I first bought the album,imagine my surprise to find all my friends' copies sounded totally different! I was thrilled to read it was FINALLY coming out on cd. I rush out to buy it, put on disc 2 and behold ----- IT'S NOT THE DELANEY BRAMLETT MIX!!!! I burned my album to cd some time ago, & you play them back to back --THEY ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT RECORDS! My copy has a different mix, different vocal on ""Bad Boy"", a Leon Russell intro (singing & playing)on ""Blues Power"", and other intros. They didn't bother to listen to this cd before they made it, or I have the only copy that exists(I highly doubt it). The extras are ok, and the packaging is beautiful, but the representation of this as the Delaney Bramlett mix is fraudulent. I'm out $25.00,extremely dissappointed & mad. Next stop is to contact Polydor."
3,Eric Clapton,I would have preferred the original version to the deluxe version. I did not realize I was getting the deluxe version.
4,It was better than expected,"It is kind of the thing about these type of anime that makes people wonder why so many chicks focus on one guy, but hey it has worked before and it still works now, It does not come close to sekirei in storyline in this subject, but it comes in behind it with some precision."
4,Not Bad....,"I brought this DVD based on a feeling that it might be pretty good. It was. After watching it all the way thru, I found myself really liking it. The only thing I thought was a bit of a turn off was that main hero doesn't ever make a choice between the many gals he deals with at the end. (Sorry about the spoiler!) If you fellow what he says over and over again during the series, then what he finally does at the end is a cop out. Oh, well. It let's him off the hook, so to speak. Anyway a really good DVD."
4,its a good anime,If you like fuuny action and some sexy then here you go now the anime itself is good the story is not that hard to understand at all but I will say that the ending just watch it to find out i mean the ending should have been better In my op
3,Better series out there,"This series is not as good as many other harem anime out there. If you like harem anime then freezing, Sekerei, or. Rosario & Vampire are all far better than this one."
2,what i said,i purchase this mobo on december for 2007 and i never try it because i didn't found a processor for it so i can't tell if it's good or not.
4,what mom in law wanted for Christmas,Mom in law suffers from sinus pressure that affects her vision. Not only does this improve by reducing the swelling but also xalms her while doing it.
4,A Ravashing Book!!!!!!!,"Drivers Ed was a very exciting and suspenseful book! Every chapter was a new adventure and nothing came out until the end.This book is wonderful if you like suspensful,exciting relationships. Things happen that you would least expect and it is wonderful if you are between the grades of 7-9. This is an outstanding innocent suspensful book! Hope you enjoy!!!"
4,Driver's Ed,"So far what I have read of this book, I like a lot, and it seems really good. It's a book from a high schooler's perspective, and it's really intersting."
3,an okay book,"The book i read was Driver's Ed by Caroline B. Cooney. Its abot these teenage kids named Remy,Morgan and Nickie. They are all good friends, Remy and Morgan like each other. The part i didn't like was when Denise Tompson died.She died because Remy,Morgan and Nickie took the stop sign. They were just trying to have fun. They didn't want to kill anybody. The book was kind of boring. I think is not a good book to read its a boring book."
5,Drivers ED,"This review on the book Drivers ED, is on the cool events of the book. The author is Caroline B. Cooney, she has written many books such as The Face On The Milk Carton.The book is about a girl named Remy Marland, and her friends Nickie Buddie, Lark, and Morgan Campell. It takes place in Junior High. They have been planning a sign-stealing trip. Remy wanted the sign Morgan Road. What better than the name of the boy she had a crush on. They didn't know who did it, but some one stole a stop sign, and it would have dire consequences. It is a stunning novel and I think you should read it. Just take my word for it. It is full of suspense and mystery, read it and you will be on the edge of your seat."
3,This book has an interesting plot but is entirely to short.,Caroline B. Cooney does an excellent job of showing how a teenager feels and acts. She has very fine details and and interesting twist by putting the romance in the midst of this chaos. The book shows one how a simple prank can end in disaster. Remy and her hubby did not think about the consequences and look what happened a person was killed. This book shows the attitude of the world. The parents where shock at this horrific event but the fathers accepted it as a simple teenage screw up. The mothers however overreacted and did the worst thing possible by shunning their kids.
3,homeschooling,"Excellent book, but not exactly what I was looking for. I finally got the manual from DMV, which is perfect.Thank you much."
5,Great book!,"I had recently read this book for a reading project, and it is yet another great book from Caroline B. Cooney! I would definitely recommend this book."
5,STOP and think,This book is about 2 teens named Morgan and Remy. It is about them and the journey through the troubles they are having.First of all both of them like each other but is to afraid to tell. Then there driver's ed class comes up with the idea that everybody should get a road sign. When Remy and Morgan take theres it leads to someones death. Can Remy and Morgan get past it or will they tell that they did it?
4,Driver's ED,"The High School has a driver's ed class. They go out and drive with Mr. Feilding. In class they were talking about stealing a sign. So one night they go out and take Thickley Settled, Morgan Road, and a stop sign. Later they are watching the news and at the place they took the stop sign there was an accident that killed a women named Denise Tompson. They keep it a secret for a while and then they couldn't bear it any more and told. Then their moms were especially mad at them. Then they finaly made it up with their moms and every thing worked out in the end."
5,This Book = Good,"Books like these don't come along often. Books that lock in on your heart and bond it to the hearts of the characters. I could picture the faces of Remy, Morgan, and Mack when they found out about the accident. I could feel their hearts drop into their stomachs. A riveting novel."
4,Live and Learn.,"I thought that this book was great. If you were to take two normal teenagers and put them into this situation, like anyone, they would be completly shocked. Remy and Morgan did have many real life-related obstacles, and that's where every other teenager in the world and I come in. We can relate to this sort of thing. This book teaches you about love and friendship. And how two lovers mascarade can lead to others' loss. I think the punishments could've been harsher on Remy and Morgan, but more importantly, the book teaches teenagers all over the world how stupidness can always lead into something tradgic. This just goes to say that we can all make mistakes, but some mistakes come when they are least expected."
3,This book was pretty good,"I thought that this book was pretty good until it got to the point of Remy and Morgan falling in 'love', it was pretty boring at times, but a lot of the sequences were very accurate in that sense, but I feel that this has already been done before. I've heard this type of scenario many times. A lot of teenagers do really stupid pranks without really realizing what could happen. They are immature and don't know how to grow up. The road is a very serious subject and I think people should think more about what they are doing, it's a continous loop affecting one another in different ways. It's good that Caroline B. Cononey wrote this book but I'm not sure if people will change that much, maybe it will make people think.. My personal opinion I didn't think it was a very bad book.. people should read it."
3,This book was good but it was a little slow in some parts.,"This book was very interesting. I believe that if this happened in real life the the characters would of acted pretty much how they did. It was well written but in some parts it just sort of dragged on. The main charaters, Remy and Morgan, were written very well. I recomend this book if you have a lot of time on your hands."
3,The book was decent.,"I thought the book was OK. The beginning started out a little slow, but it gradually picked up.The book was a real life problem like kids stealing a sign. Remi and Morgan's two families are very different and I think that kids can relate to that. I do think that they should have been punished more, because they did take a life. But overall the book was pretty good."
2,DE Review,"Driver's Ed is about some teenagers that steal a stop sign and someone dies in a car crash as a result. The teens are guilt-ridden and ask of each other whether or not to confess.This book was very hard to get into. What little action there was was at the end of the book. There were many unneeded characters at the beginning, too. I really didn't enjoy reading about someone's guilt trip because they did something stupid like steal a sign. If this book was written to teach a lesson, it was one I already learned, so I didn't need to read this.I wouldn't recommend this book. If you're looking for a suspensful book about peer pressure and teens doing morally incorrect things, I would suggest Breaking Point by Alex Flinn over this book."
3,Will remind you to think about others,"Remy Marland and Morgan Campbell are just like any other sixteen-year-old who just got their license. One night, Remy and Morgan, along with a boy named Nickie Budie who everyone knows is ""pond scum"" decide to take part in what they think is a harmless prank: stealing road signs. However, the teens steal a stop sign from a busy intersection, and the next day on the news, Morgan finds out that a woman was killed in a car accident on the same intersection in which they stole the stop sign. Remy and her driver's ed class soon all find out what happened, and she and Morgan are constantly bothered by their own consciences. This book taught me to question your actions, and to think about others before you act.I recommend this book for kids age 12-14."
3,Courtesy of Mother Daughter Book Club.com,"One mom described the book as having a storyline perfect for ""an after-school special."" It involves a senator's son, a girl from an unconventional household, teen love, a burned-out teacher, death, a horrible secret and facing the consequences of one's actions.Most of our book club members thought the characters in Driver's Ed were two dimensional, and everyone agreed that both moms in the book were unrealistically portrayed. But we had a good discussion about actions that turn out to have dire consequences even though they seem harmless when you choose to do them. And we all got a chance to talk about our current experiences, with moms weighing in on frightening times in the passenger seat and daughters talking about parents ""freaking them out"" and making them nervous behind the wheel. It was fun to realize that most of our stories were similar.I would recommend reading Driver's Ed for the discussion it prompts rather than for the book itself."
3,I think the theme of this book is good.,"On the other hand, I found the reading level of the book too easy for high school readers. The theme was excellent. It shows what simple things kids take as a joke can completely destroy the lives of others. I also found it interesting how each character dealt with the disaster. For example, Morgan is eating frosting and he thought it tasted like smashed car, destroyed flesh, and broken bones. Overall the book was average. It conveyed a good message."
4,Tragedy yet reality,"I'de have to say...WOW! This book was great. It did have a slow start but as the story went along, I went along with it. As a beginning driver, it really clarified the dangers of being on the road and all the stupid stunts that people do and what to look out for. It was just so great that this book was so realistic and that it relates to teenagers' lives in many ways. I would reccomend this book to anyone learning to drive or even thinking about doing a stupid stunt like taking away a stop sign or any road sign...even though you might not be hurt in an accident, it will hurt you worse to know that you caused it."
4,Driver's Ed,"Driver's Ed by Caroline B. Cooney started out as a fairly boring book. Remy is a high school student starting driver's education class. She is very eager to get her license and always wants to drive. Later on in the story, Remy, Morgan (Remy's dream boyfriend), Lark (Remy's best friend), and Nickie (the only one of the four with a license) all play a ""game"" where each one of them steals a street sign. On the night it all happens, Lark backs out because her mother becomes sick. They go on with it anyway and steal two road signs and a stop sign. Soon after, a horrible accident happens in the same place that the stop sign was stolen. Now Remy and Morgan either confess to the crime they committed or live with the horrible guilt of someone dying because of them.I enjoyed this book because it was very suspenseful and the words that Cooney used made me want to keep reading. On a scale of one to ten, I would rate this book a solid eight."
4,Drivers Ed in a twisted way,"Three teens Remy, Nicky, and Morgan are your average teens. Grow up around wealthy high class parents who would never think their son or daughter is ever bad. Well this time they all are going to be surpirzed when their children tell them they are partially guilty in the death of a woman. Denise Thompson who was in her twenties with a husband and baby boy was killed from crossing a road and a truck t-boned her. The cause of the accident was from a stop sign being cut down. Remy, Nicky and Morgan are the theives of a the stop sign. Not in their wildest dreams did they ever expect to see on the news that someone died from their actions.I give this book a 4 because it was a good suspensionful book but the ending was not all that and a bag of chips if you know what I mean. The climax and plot are wonderful and can make anyone relate to a scary memory from the past where you tried to keep a secret and couldn't sleep, because you always thought about it."
4,timeless bedtime,"A comforting little tale, classicly illustrated.Caring for his lands in his nighttime rounds,with words of comfort for all who will hear,The Tomten reminds us all of his Earth's simple treasures.Wights blessings!publication note: Be sure to find one of the older prints from Europe or Canada...based on other reviews here,I guess that the newer and/or paperback copies are poorly printed in cheaper facilities. The one I got wasprinted in Slovakia in the early 90s and is beautiful."
3,The Tomten,"This is an English translation of a traditional Swedish childrens tale. I thought it was a nice little story, the illustrations could have been better though. This would be a good one to get for your kid if your trying to avoid the usual pop culture garbage."
5,SUPERB & COMFORTING Memories,"The Tomten was my first and favorite childhood book. Today, I read it to my daughter as her bedtime story. It is her favorite book also. This book is the perfect comforting bedtime story for children of all ages. The author magically weaves fantasy and security into the story of The Tomten. Reading The Tomten gives you that ""safe in the bed between your parents"" feeling we all remember.The author, Austrid Lindgren, passed away today. The world has lost a timeless treasure. Thank you Mrs. Lindgren. You will be missed by generations."
2,visual environment pollution,"Don't go for this cheap version if you care about your child's visual education. As other reviewers noted before, the printing quality is very poor, so the illustrations look sketchy and dull. Result: all the magic is gone."
4,"Remembering ""The Tomten""","I had this book when I was very small. My uncle who was a librarian gave us a library bound edition hardback. I discovered it at my grandma's house when I was visiting about 15 years ago and almost cried. I could still remember it. I brought it home and read it to my kids and they all loved it. I agree about the picture quality in the paperback, sort of washed out and not as good as the old hardbacks. If you can get hold of an older copy, from a library or something, it will probably not be in pristine shape but will have the nicer paper and illustrations."
3,Not what I thought,OK this Book is nuthin what everyone in delaware hypes it up to be ok it was accurate in location and shouted alot of my people out but its not the bomb like that.
1,WOW,"OK, This is what I think the book was wack. I was Born ANd raised in delaware, this is nothing like Delaware. we got our hot spots but the hustlers i know will tell the story a lil different i wish Leondrei would hae keep it gully instead of making stuff up and told the true story about the lil hustle game in D-ware it migth hae made a better story."
5,Is the Game Fair?,From start to finish this books captures your attention and draws you into the story. All four men have a bond that is unbreakable and loyalty for each other beyond belief. You have to purchase the Pt 1 and 2 together and to be honest there should be a Pt 3 the way it ended.
3,Review of The Untouchable,"Beware, this is NOT the Intouchables about the black nurse's aid for the rich paraplegic man. That one is very poplar in both France and the U.S. according to the French and the Americans I've talked to. It's what I thought I was getting when I ordered this movie. My mistake.This The Intouchable is about the grown daughter of an unmarried French woman. The daughter learns her father is Indian (Asian), so she travels to India to find him. I think I'm not giving anything away by saying that he's of the untouchable caste in India--the film's title is The Untouchable afterall. The movie shows the daughter's experiences in India. It's in both English and French, with English subtitles."
4,"The series really ""LAUNCHES"" here....","I've read most of the books in this series and I have to tell you that this one really made the series take off! The reader is welcomed into the lives of these characters with more depth and meaning than ever before. The story itself (The dating service and the serial killer) lends to enough suspense to keep the reader on the edge of the seat, but when one of ""our own"" (Peabody) goes undercover, you feel the fear akin to one of your own loved ones putting herself at risk.An excellent story with quite an unexpected ending. I would recommend this series HIGHLY!"
5,Fantastic Series - All Keepers,"I have read all 28 reviews and the reader from Minnesota sums up the book the best for me. Since I am a big fan of romance and mystery, I don't place much emphasis on the sci-fi aspects of the book. Therefore, if you are into sci-fi you will probably be a little disappointed. But it is truly the best of its kind out today. If I could I would read the series from the beginning to the end once a year. It is that good."
5,Even the Holiday Season attracts Killers....,"Holiday In Death is another great addition to this thrilling series. Not only is it Eve and Roake's first Christmas together but there is a serial killer running around. A serial killer who dresses up like Santa Clause, is very neat and tidy and uses ""The Twelve Days of Christmas "" as his theme. The suspense in this series just keeps getting better. I never know the ""who done it "" until the very end. This is an excellent installment."
5,Oh yes,Love all J. D. Robb books keep you guessing all the time. Can't put the book down once you read the first chapter.
1,"Love the story, hate the book",My husband ordered this for me as a Christmas gift. I love the In Death books by JDRobb and am trying to convert my collection from paperbacks to hardcover. However this one is a joke! The size is ridiculous its just a paperback with cardboard slapped on the front and back!
5,Loved it,"This book really shows the struggle that Eve has with friendships. Along with Roarke and Peabody.....what more do you need? Did I mention Roarke, hot, hot, hot!"
4,J.D.Robb hits a satisfying triple as always.,Count on Nora Roberts to deliver as J.D. Robb. They're all good ... when is the next due? Sign me up....
4,Great mix of suspense and romance.,"This is the first book I read in the ""In Death..."" series, and it definitely won't be the last. I'm generally a romance reader, but the mystery half of this novel really engaged me and was a nice change of pace. I think the romance side of the story suffered a bit for me because I hadn't read the previous books and wasn't up on on the history of the characters' relationship. However, I still enjoyed it and was particularly impressed with the way Robb/Roberts successfully added some tension and interest in a long-term, committed relationship."
2,Not so Thrilling,"I don't understand why this book keeps getting positive reviews, maybe they're all loyal fans of J.D. Robb. I'm not going to write any negative about the author,because I havent't read any of her other books, but this one is not so special. For those looking to read an orginal and clever book this wouldn't be the one."
1,Positively Garbage!,"Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this one stinks!It is set in the future: what a great opportunity for adding an interesting element and yet nothing is made of it! The characters are flat: the protagonist is not the least bit likeable. Her husband seems to function merely as her sex toy as their relationship seems to consist of nothing but panting at the sight of him. Otherwise, she is driven, mean, abrasive--not the kind of person you would want to meet.The mystery itself lacks any kind of suspense and is utterly predictable.Take it from an avid mystery reader: you'll be hard pressed to find anything more ridiculous, predictable and trashy anywhere. Strictly bottom of the barrel."
5,Pleased,"Purchased for wife, who has set out to read all of Nora Roberts Books. This was one of three of the last she had not read in the ""..In Death"" series. Book was received on time and in excellent condition."
5,Another good addition to the series...,"I'm rereading the In Death series and writing reviews for those I missed the first time around. This was another good addition to the series, with Eve learning to deal with all the extra people in her life, and the relationship issues that arise from that. Eve and Roarke are still going strong - Robb does a great job of keeping their relationship alive, and making us care about the secondary characters just as much as the primaries. The plot idea was good, and the story was well paced."
2,Average thriller/Below average science fiction,"I seem to be one of the few reviewers who occasionally writes a lukewarm to bad review-Somebodys gotta do it! This book is a hybrid consisting of science fiction and mystery and both genres suffer. Science fiction readers will find it pedestrian and trite. It will appeal to some mystery readers, however, I am not one of them. The characters were pretty much ""stock"" and the writing pretty much bestseller-ish. No surprises here and not much depth or wit either. I prefer Deaver or Daheim, and Kress and Gibson."
1,Short story,"This is not a full length book. It is a short story that was published in a collection that I have already read called ""Silent Night"". Good story, but not what I expected. I've read all of the JD Robb ""in Death"" books, but thought I had found one I had missed. My fault for not having a list to refer to before I ordered."
3,Holiday in Death (In Death #7),"redundant, but ok. problem with disks not ejecting which is not a normal event with other cd's. too much time spent in bed, booorrring."
4,One of the better in the series (in my opinion),"This was one of the better in the series, I think; I liked the premise behind the murders (i.e. the 12 days of Christmas). However, as with many of the books in the series, she does fall back on psychological cliches to explain her killers; there is little creativity in the ""why"" of this one, even if the ""how"" is entertaining. Her characters are entertaining as always. As with any In Death book, it's a fun throw away read if you aren't expecting too much."
5,Loved It!,Took this book on vacation with me and could not put it down. Every time I thought I had it figured out the characters proved me wrong. Love the whole series!
3,Good book,Thank you. Nora Roberts always provides an outstanding and entertaining story. Good book. She makes Eva Dallas and Roarke sound so real.
5,Worthy addition !!,"This excellent recording contains a superior version of ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"" not found in earlier renditions where the song seems to have been given a 'second fiddle' or lesser role to the hallmark tunes of this musical. SoM fanatics need this for the sake of completion!"
5,"Gene Autry ""Back In The Saddle Again:""",It is Gene at his all time best. If you are either an old or new fan of him I highly recommend it for your collection. Again my cassettes do not even start to compare in goodness to this CD in showing his great musical talents both vocal and instrumental. A must have.
4,Very romantic !,"I enjoyed NIGHT WORLD very much. Lucan Wolf is very romantic and his voice is spooky but sexy. ""The Vampire"" is a great song along with ""Along The Edge Of Time"". I give this CD 4 stars for Lucan Wolf's voice and singing alone. Worth having !"
5,Night World,"Lucan Wolf's First Vampire release is darkly romantic and seductive. The listener is transported into the world of the vampire. Lucan's haunting vocals and dark romantic lyrics will enthrall you. If you enjoy this release you must get his others. He gets better with each release. His sexy, vampiric style is sure to mesmorize the listener. It's great for couples too. ;-)"
3,Cool CD,"I thought this was a cool CD. Why would someone give it a bad review when they didn't bother to listen to samples or the whole CD like the two morons who gave it bad comments?I liked ""The Vampire"" and ""Kindred"" my two favorite songs on the CD. This isn't like some heavy metal ""I love Satan"" crap I have heard."
4,Enjoyed this CD alot,"I enjoyed this CD alot. His 2nd CD ""Vampire Nights"" is even better but this CD is cool. It's opening track ""The Vampire"" is really sexy and Lucan Wolf sets a romantic but spooky tone from there with songs like ""Night World"" and ""Kindred"". The song ""Along The Edge Of Time"" is beautiful. I give it 4 stars for being different from the usual angry grunt and scream vampire stuff out there now. Lucan if you're reading this you can have my neck anytime!"
5,Haunting and Lyrical,Amazing stuff! - Absolutely original! Lucan's voice is simply glorious - amazingly rich and full with an incredible range. His lyrics are haunting and thought provoking and his music a lovely counterpoint - I highly recommend this album!
1,Misleading picture,"I bought this with the peridot earrings from the same seller, so if you see a repetition of the points i make its because the seller is the same,firstly the picture makes it look a lot better than it is,its a very pale green, at more than [...] including shipping it looks more like a [...] piece of costume jewelry,i am really surprised some reviewers claim to have worn this as wedding jewelry,this mainly was what made me buy it, goes to show caveat emptor, its now to late to get anything else so i really can't return it,would not recommend it to anyone else"
3,Content - OK ::::::: Presentation - Awful,"The reviews written by others are pretty accurate. This is a half-decent 2-DVD set of a sampling of some old TV shows. It is the presentation of these shows that is so annoying. The ""intro"" to each show, mostly by Dale Reed, is watchable ONCE but one has to agonize through them every time one watches any of these shows again ... and they are not able to be skipped except by tedious fast-forwarding thru them. Very, very annoying."
1,Better deals elsewhere,"I purchased this cellophane-wrapped box in a bookstore, as I was searching for TV classic DVD's. There was nothing listed on the back of the box as to what particular shows were inside, just some vague information. As the box was wrapped and I couldn't open it to look at the contents, I decided to just take a chance and get it, as I love classic tv. Well, after getting it home, and unwrapping it, I found, also cellophane wrapped inside, two disc-packages, with information on what shows were on each disc. It did not give specifics about the shows.I opened the first and played it, but there was a gentleman giving a long narrative before each show, which I found very disconcerting and off-putting. Not even bothering to watch, I returned it to the store where I purchased it. Look around on Amazon, as there are better deals in classic TV shows to be found for the money. Thumbs down on this one."
4,Could use better labeling,"The episodes and the introductions to the episodes were great. However, it would have been nice if they had listed the title of the individual episode. That way, I could check to see when it aired and add it to my database of classic television. Most DVD collections list the name of that particular episode of the show."
2,too bad about the film quality,"The episodes were good, and a nice sampling of shows. Unfortunately, the film quality did not match the quality of the shows. This affected the rating."
5,JUST GOT IT,"I was motivated by ""On With the Song,"" a wonderul tribute to the Dixie Chicks. I am in awe of the entire album. ""The Calling."" This record may be next year's ""Album of the Year"" at the Grammy's."
5,MCC's best ever,"Her trademark mix of reflective and assertive songs that the lyrics to actually make sense. More mystical than some of her stuff. Defies categorization, she's NOT country! I can't stop listening to it, and am not one prone to gushing."
2,Get back to the music...Forget the message,"I was really disappointed in this one. What a shame she is wasting such a talent on such bad material. If you want to write a comentary, or go protest, then do it. Then get back in the studio and produce some more great work like you used to."
1,Not up to par for Mary Carpenter Chapin,"I absolutely love Mary Chapin Carpenter's ""Essentials"" CD. So I was very, very, very disappointed with ""The Calling.""""Essentials"" reveals a woman who is highly talented, who sounds like she loves the music she is singing, who has a good vocal range and quality, and who has musicians, composers, and studio technicians who know what they are doing and do it.""The Calling"" is exactly the opposite. Mary Carpenter sounds unpracticed and bashful, she sounds like she does not enjoy the music she is singing, it appears she can only sing about 10 notes, and the accompanyments and the mixing sound amaturish. I'm sorry I spent $10 for this download and wish I could send it back."
3,It was ok,"There are a few songs on here that I like but all in all, not nearly as good as her last CD. That was magic this is like I said just ok."
2,most songs lacking what makes me a fan of MCC,"This collection lacks the mesmerizing quality of ""Stones"", my favorite MCC offering, and the poetic phrasing so typical of nearly every other one of her previous releases. Lines like ""jingoistic bumper stickers"" and ""attention must be paid"" clank loudly compared to past gems like ""sienna shades of light"", ""halcyon days"", and ""lambent wind"". The celeb solidarity anthem ""On with the Song"" is half-baked as well as disingenuous. This is political braying, not the thoughtful eloquence delivered in ""Grand Central Station"" or the title track of ""Stones"". Plus, who is being addressed with the line ""So do what you want 'cuz I know that you can""? You can't feel a radio backlash when your songs aren't played there to begin with. Still, there are a few redeeming tracks, like ""Twilight"" and ""It Must Have Happened"", and MCC's talent for combining imagery and melodies resonates through them."
3,Better when she doesn't try to preach politics.,I like it better when an artist doesn't try to tell me how right thier way of thinking is and how wrong any other political view has to be. I mean they should just stick to entertaining since none of them are smart enough to do more than that.That aside this is just okay music compared to much of her other work. If you happen to be a big fan (like me) you will likely want this cd (and mostly enjoy it). If you are looking to give Mary Chapin Carpenter a try then I would look into Stones in the Road for a first purchase.
5,Excellent Buy,"Just Enough AutoCAD 2007 is an excellent purchase. It does just what it's title entails, it give the user just enough information on the use of autocad to give them a fairly decent jumping off point. It is extremely easy to use and read and offers a more inexpensive way of finding out what you need to know/"
3,Effective,"I ordered this product for my nomad jukebox since the regular chargers are kind of difficult to find. It works and does the job, but it does take more time."
5,THE Isherwood book,"Largely autobiographical,Isherwood covers his life from prep school to Cambridge and a brief,ill advised stint in medical school and brings to life the characters that illuminated him (thinly disguised Auden and Spender amongst others) on his journey to self awareness and becoming a writer.This book is so good. The narrative is rich and never bores and Isherwood wonderfully evokes the atmosphere of post WW1 England;the fleeting mentions of Hitler,Mussolini and the 1926 general strike all add to the narrative,and the wittisisms and anecdotes are superlative. Odds on you'll be refering to the 'watcher in Spanish' 'Poshocrats' and the 'Poshocracy' ever after!The copy I bought had a crass 1970's illustration and stencil lettering on the cover.If ever a book so completely proves the old adage re not judging a book,this is it. Arguably better than even his 'Berlin' novels.A definate five star book."
5,Classic Isherwood. I enjoyed it tremendously,"This is sort of a novelization of Isherwood's years as a student and the between the wars era in England. I find that era fascinating and this book is filled with details about how life was lived back then.The book is very readable. Isherwood has a distinct, clear writing style that I love. He makes everything interesting. If you liked Berlin Stories I'd expect you'll like this as well. (That's how I came to this book). Highly recommended."
1,Run! Run! Avoid with your Life!!,"The. Worst. Movie. I. Have. Ever. Seen.One star is too many. This makes all the other bad movies I've seen look like Shakespeare. Honestly. There is no script, no plot, no characters, no story, no scenes, no acting, no direction. The audio and video quality are atrocious. Whoever financed this were utter fools. There is the barest hint of an idea in the premise on the DVD blurb, but it is NOT executed. There is no attempt to even tell a story. The documentary special feature ""Burning Sand"" is almost as bad.I really, really, really want that two hours + of my life back."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 50\50 BUY,"ON THREE SEPERATE OCCASION MY BABY'S CARSEAT HAS FLIPED OVER. I TRIED IT WITH THE LACHTS IT FLIP OVER, THEN WITH THE SEAT BEAT IT FLIP OVER THEN I MOVE IT IN THE CENTER AND STILL FLIPED OVER. THE STROLLER I HAVENT HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT BUT THE CARSEAT IS A DEATH TRAP!"
1,UNSAFE!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I purchased the Eddie Bauer Manchester travel system before my son was born and 3 months later, the safety straps fell off. I returned that one and purchased this new updated version. I put my 3 month old in it and turned into a parking space and the whole carseat tipped over!! Luckily he wasn't hurt. The reason it tipped is because the base is smaller than the carseat so it is top heavy. When I returned it that day, a worker told me I was the second person that day with the same complaint! Needless to say, I will never trust anything Eddie Bauer again. When I voiced my complaint to the manufacture, they were very rude. So, if you want your child safe don't buy this travel system!"
2,Fitness book,"The book was advertised as new however, the book has a permanent dent in the middle.I do like the material in the book but was diappointed in the condition of how the book was suppose to be."
4,Worth Reading for Historical Information,The historical information makes this a book worth reading. I have just started reading it and find it very interesting.
2,white vessel bowl that is really green,"The service was excellent, but the sink is green rather then white! That makes me less than happy. When I order a white vessel sink I expected it to be white, not green."
2,Dial a Storm,"I bought this book mainly out of curiosity. The main theme I got was the correlation between past geological disasters, such as the eruptions of Mount Vesuvius and the disappearance of Atlantis, and what the future has in store for us. What I read wasn't really that big of a surprise. California has been expecting The Big Quake for decades, and each year I hear that it could come in the next thirty years. There is no countdown or predicted date because nobody knows.What the author is trying to do is predict when certain storms or eruptions will pop up in any given area by using the astrological positions of the planets. She lists each geological area, along with the date and the disaster that is supposed to strike. If I had a choice between believing the weatherman and this book, I think I'll look outside and use my common sense."
1,Terrible Movie,"I would not recommend this movie to anyone.Bad script,bad acting,shark attack images are very dodgy, the moving sharks are a cut and paste job from a National Geographic documentary.Don't waste your money on this."
3,"Good, not Great",This book provides a number of case studies on applying data mining. I didn't learn a lot since the studies weren't applicable to what I am doing. Someone else might get more out of than me though. I did like their first book (it was very good) but this one wasn't nearly as good. There are better books that discuss the use of data mining software.
5,A master piece,"Although aged the book remains a precious guide for business and CRM people. It argues that data mining is a discipline that must be mastered by concentrating in how to approach analytics than how to use tools. Specifically it stresses the importance of:- the iterative nature of data mining activities (and project life cycle)- the active involvement of business people- the business objectives and needs- the preparation and split of the model set (mining view)- the evaluation of produced models and patterns- the business interpretation of data mining results- the power of data exploration (by example)""Mastering Data Mining"" is a much more concrete and comprehensive book than ""Data Mining Techniques, 2nd edition""."
4,Ideas for GUI design of data mining software,"While doing a graduate elective on Decision Making Technologies, I realized that data visualization and representation is crucial for data exploratory and validation of data mining analysis. To get some ideas on how the various data visualization and workflow techniques are applied and integrated into the GUI of commercial softwares, survey the various chapters of this book."
3,so-so,"The book did keep me hooked, but even while I was turning pages, I kept having questions about the reality of the physical setting and characters that were never answered - for instance, about the background of the protagonist and Laurentia. I think that the lack of credibility on this level of the story kept me from enjoying the more supernatural aspects of the plot, even though they were intriguing."
2,cunningham clamp,"The measurement 1 to 2"" is not defined. Purchased a ""regular"" it is smaller than expected. If the urine is released with the clamp in place, the urethra will be painful. It is not being used."
4,I Never Expected This,"I never expected that Vanessa Carlton's debut CD would be this good! First, to start with, I wasn't really thrilled with her first single ""A Thousand Mile"", because it sounded a lot like Michelle Branch, but then I got the Cd, because I was curious to see what kind of other songs she had on it. And I was amazed to see that she can play the piano very well! I love this style of music. My favorite songs are ""Pretty Baby"", ""Paint It Black"", and ""Wanted"". Those show the most of her talent, I think. She really sings with a lot of heart, and you start to understand what she was thinking when she was singing the song. I really like this CD. Buy it, and you won't be dissapointed! :)"
2,I am disappointed,"Vanessa Carlton is a very talented singer and I had the greatest expectations about this album. ""A thousand miles"" is a great song. The video is good as well, with vanessa and her magical piano going everywhere.I ordered this CD without even listening to it, because I thought all the songs would be like the debut single. Actually, I was wrong. The album is kind of boring. I don't think it is Vanessa's fault. She is great, but ""be not nobody"" does not work as an album (perhaps because the songs are all a little depressing). By the way, ""ordinary day"" is good and worths to be checked out.I bought this CD, and I also have avril lavigne's ""Let go"" and michelle's branch ""spirit room"". I listen to these last two CDs a lot, unlike vanessa's album.I'm surprised that many people on this page have the same feeling about vanessa carlton CD, and I do not recommend it. I'm sorry."
2,Good thing I checked before I bought,"""1000 miles"" is defintely catchy. The piano sounds great, and it had me beleive that perhaps Carlton's whole CD would be like that: the strong and powerful piano a-la Apple or Amos. However, when I checked samples before I bought the CD, I noticed that something bothered me, and it definitely was the voice. It does need more work and much more improvement, and piano could be as loose as in ""1000 miles"". I am still holding much hope for the second album, because this one surely sounded like a demo."
1,ok,This girl can play the piano yes. But she cannot sing. She sounds like a little girl trying to put words together and sound cute. The best song is a thousand miles and that song rinse is so annoying and so is the rest of the album.
1,she's awful!,"after hearing her song ""a thousand miles"" I couldn't stand her. she's a terrible singer, just awful! that song got so annoying too, i heard it in a few stores quite a bit and I couldn't stand it, the song and her voice, just horrible! horrible, horrible horrible! also, it was embarassing to listen to her! it was just as bad as listening britney spears or shakira! i honestly never heard anything so awful in my life!"
1,"Puh-lease, spare me","Like get real. Once I saw Alicia Keys's success I knew that lame wannabes would start flooding in. So wut if she had proper piano lessons? So do I. So does my 7 year old cousin. Alicia Keys is the original of this generation. This is juz some money making scam. Come on, the girl has no talent. If she can write like Alicia then maybe she deserves some credit. And honey, it don't hurt if u attend vocal classes as well. In fact, u should stay in those classes for a good 5 years or so b4 u release ur next album. This one's goin into the trash. Always remember : stay away from the mic. Dont go anywhere near it and the world juz might live to see another day."
3,Not too shabby,"I prefer Alanis, Sarah MacLaughlin (sp?), Jewel, Sinead, Tracy Chapman, Dolores O'Rierdan (sp?), and Gwen Stefani, as artists who have that extra ""something special"" for me to hear. While this CD is good, it doesn't grab me the way the other artists do. The only song I thought was fantastic was ""Thousand Miles"" and most people are already overexposed to that song."
4,Poetic Beauty,"Vanessa Carltons' first atempt in the musical world was an instant hit. Her album, Be Not Nobody, took the world by storm, with lyricly driven verses, and catchy chorus tunes.The most famous of her first songs, A Thousand Miles, has become a staple of any movie/road trip theme. Here skills on the piano have only helped raise her above the rest of the music world, by giving her that edge few artists ever find.The best song on the album though, would have to be the first track, Ordinary Day. The semi love song speaks wonders to the true feelings of many young people in their first relationship. And the musicality of the song is undenieable.Look for her second album to really step up her game."
4,great album,This record is the most unique and stand out debut in years .It flows from the start too finish . From the haunting rinse to the bass driven prince this album is simply slendid .Vanessa carlton shows maturity far bayond her 22 years . This setlist of songs makes you only wonder what her next record will sound like after such a brillant debut .
1,so overrated,"A Thousand miles may have that delicious, catchy piano hook that makes it one of the biggest hits of 2002, but don't be fooled. Her voice is really annoying, worse than scratching your nails on a chalkboard. None of the other album tracks are good, they're very boring and have no substance. Go listen to Mozart or some other real pianist if you're looking for good piano music.The only reason they hyped her up was so alicia keys could have competition. Don't let your ears decieve you"
2,"great songs, BAD recording","Love the music, but the recording sounds horrible!! I took the first cd back to the store to get another hoping it was just a fluke, but no such luck. It sounds like the record levels were set too high....lots of static and scratching sounds in most of the songs. Has anyone else experienced this? I first thought it was just my equipment, but all my other cd's sound fine. I was pretty bummed b/c I'd been waiting for this cd to come out for a long time."
2,A Disappointment,"After hearing A Thousand Miles and then downloading a few more of Vanessa's live solo songs...I was really looking forward to this album's release. But what a disappointment! Not surprisingly...overproduction has ruined this CD. On top of that...the CD had a bit darker of a feel to it than I expected after hearing A Thousand Miles.There are only 3 songs really worth listening to on this CD. A Thousand Miles, Ordinary Day, and Twilight. But do yourself a favor...if possible, download live versions of these songs with Vanessa playing solo because that's when her talent really shines."
4,in finding herself,"Wow. Completely unexpected. She's not one dimensional at all. She's not like every other artist on TRL. She has something most artists today don't...talent. I was expecting something of the moment, something that you'd find at a garage sale 3 months from now, but this beautiful music takes you so far away. She's young still, as is evident by her elementary school lyrics, but with the time, her lyrics will improve and the power that flows through her fingers will rival that of Tori Amos."
3,The Son of Sam had a fine day,"I must admit to eagerly awaiting this debut album. I loved ""A Thousand Miles,"" I haven't heard such an effortlessly beautiful single in quite sometime. But alas, the album doesn't quite live up to that promise. I love Wanted, its almost hard to listen to at parts, but it comes across as entirely real and full of emotion. Thats where I believe the rest of the album falters the rest of the songs just seem like going through the motions, and emotion seems to be lacking to me. I was thoroughly bored, and the Paint It Black cover is just plain embarassing, its almost as bad as Britneys ill-fated attempt at Satisfaction. Vanessa is obviously one to watch, hopefully this album is only a hint of what she has in her."
2,I was disappointed.,I was disappointed. I have waited for a long time for this cd to come out and when I finally got it. It was a big let down. On the whole cd only 2 songs are the only things I'm able to listen to. The whole cd is overproduced and overdone which does not let the true talent come out.
2,Sorry,"I bought this CD since the single wasn't bad and I'm always greedy for music by girls with a piano and a nice indie sound. Unfortunately I didn't like it much. Vanessa's voice is monotonous, always sounding like she's making a major effort to sing - she tires me out. The tunes are pretty monotonous too, and the lyrics, well, she's not deep or sophisticated like a Fiona Apple..."
4,Great Cd .,"I bought this cd because I liked a thousand miles. This cd has some really good songs like a thousand miles, Sway,Ordinary Day. Unsung,paint it Black, and Wanted. Also Pretty Baby. I enjoy this cd but it is a little creepy sometimes for me that is why i rate it four stars."
2,So! This a Nobody huh?,"Ok this is not what I planned to hear but I thought it would be a good CD by the song ""A Thousand Miles"" but I was wrong and then poof! I spent my money on a CD that is only half good. Vanessa Carlton has to do a lot better than this if I am to buy her next CD if she makes one."
3,...,"I got this CD a few weeks ago with the thought of it being good. Ordinary Day, A Thousand Miles, and Pretty Baby are the only songs worth listening too. They are actually great songs. The rest are pointless. Unsung is good...but only the first half of it. Since others are comparing her to Michelle Branch...I might as well also. Michelle has very good songs and seems to be singing the way her emotions are...while Vanessa seems fake. The same day I got Avril Lavigne. Although she is very different from Calrton...I would FOR SURE recommend Avril. Out of 13 songs...there is only 1 that I dont absolutly LOVE. Carlton on the other hand...well, don't buy it if you are not made of money...it's a waste. (Besdies, of course...the 3 songs that I mentioned)"
4,Raw pop?,"In the wake of such synthetic bands like *Nsync, and cookie-cutter singers like Britney Spears, has come a revival of the singer/songwriter that transformed music in the sixties. The first of these big names was, of course, Michelle Branch. Branch's album 'Sprit Room' unleashed an instant radio classic with 'Everywhere', and the spirit of that song flows through the entire album. However, Branch's lyrics leave much to be asked for by people sick of overly sappy, childish love songs. Enter Vanessa Carlton. With only three love songs to her album, one being a song about an ambitious boy ('Ordinary day'), the album is actually raw pop. The music isn't all that catchy, but it's still good stuff. Carlton's skill as a piano player and singer is still rough, but promising. Her singer/songwriting ability is amazing, given her young age. All in all, the CD is a nice revamp of a fallen genre, but it's not Sheryll Crow."
3,It is okay....,"I liked this album but it wasn't what I had thought it would be. It was rather bland and Vanessa's style got annoying at times. She had reminded me of a little girl playing at a concert recital. But the tracks Wanted and the remake of Paint it Black were pretty good. But overall, dissapointment."
2,Someone shut her up please,"Vanessa Carlton is an astouding songwriter and pianist. This album is filled with truly haunting melodies that will stay with you and lift your spirits.And then she sings. Carlton whines nasaly and completely spoils any and all songs she sings. She fails to distinguish herself in any way from Michelle Branch and Avril Lavigne, all three are exactly the same as far as vocal talent goes.I can only hope that at some point instrumental versions of these songs become available so I no longer have to suffer through the worst singing since Bob Dylan."
2,Should have just downloaded the 2 hits,"I really wish I hadn't bought this CD. I don't like any of her other songs aside from her 2 radio hits. Some songs are like the same 5-6 words over and over again. The illustrations are pretty. I am giving 2 stars for ""Ordinary Day' and'Thousand Miles"" I AM BEING VERY GENEROUS. sorry!"
5,Well Worth The Money,"This amazing Debut CD by Vanessa Carlton is well worth the money, and the time to sit down and listen to the whole album all in one sitting. Al the way from Ordinary Day to Twilight, the songs keep you interested and relaxed. Her cover of ""Paint It Black"" is one of the best covers I've heard of yet. From song to song, there are beautiful lyrics which probably hold alot of meaning. Vanessa can go rocking or tone it down with her soothing voice. I am so happy that I found out about Vanessa around New Year's day, and the wait for the album was well worth it. Do yourself a favor and buy this album! Trust me, you won't regret it!"
5,"Don't Be the Only One Without ""Be Not Nobody""!!","Vanessa Carlton is a perfect alternative to the mainstream ""pop queens"". She writes all her own songs and plays the piano as well for all of the songs. Her voice is also truely unique. With mellow tracks to more upbeat ones, the album has a little something for everyone. My personal favorite is the melodious song ""Twilight"". Check it out!"
1,Vanessa's voice just ruined everything!,"I found this CD is definitely overated! I like ""a thousand miles"" though but the rest...I have to say I cannot swallow her moaning, weak, annoying voice. Especially songs like prince, paradise, paint it black. It is very painful to listen to her voice. She needs to take some serious vocal before do anything else.I like music background though. I would buy this CD again if they produce just the music NOT Vanessa's voice."
