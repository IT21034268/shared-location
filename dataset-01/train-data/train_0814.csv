5,Love It!,Joe Satriani is one of my favorite artists. I think this album has been his best. It is several years old but it seems fresh every time I listen.
5,The most influential album on my guitar playing,"My first guitar teacher exposed me to ""Satch"" for the first time. She encouraged me to learn Midnight and other bits of songs from this disc. Since then I've learned to play many of the tunes and parts of all of them.Satch inspired me to develop my own style. He's not my only influence (I also love blues, jazz, and classical), but he's certainly been the strongest. I've written a number of instrumental tunes that have a bit of the Satch flavor, but I've borrowed from a lot of other musicians as well.I definitely recommend his other discs as well. Crystal Planet, The Extremist, and Flying in a Blue Dream are probably the most accessible, but the others are great too."
5,THE Guitar Master,"I think what sets this album apart from all the rest for me is not so much Joe's lead work (which is EXCELLENT don't get me wrong) but the rhythm section that provides that ""tape loop"" element that is designed to showcase the lead guitar work (listen to a few of his albums and you'll see what I mean). The rhythm guitar, bass, and drum sections are so tight that the lead comes across so much more dramatic than it actually is on its own. It's sickeningly powerful concoction, and its hard not to just sit on the edge of your seat in anticipation of the wild lead stacattos that permeate the entire album. Steady diets of this stuff will probably bore you, making you feel like you're playing Nintendo (around and around and around the race track). But when you're in the mood to hear some incredible lead solos, always grab the Satriani, since their's nothing to beat it."
2,"Interesting album, takes the Alien theme a little too far...","I really did not like this album much when I got it, and was quite disappointed. It has grown on me a little since then. It reminds me of background music used on 70's sci-fi shows like Blakes-7 (or perhaps the film Flash Gordon) - it probably sounds synth. like. I think the album keeps the sci-fi like alien theme going through out (hmmm) -- if you bear that in mind, it kind of makes sense. Things that are growing on me: the wooshing silver surfer effect on the title track, and ice 9 (it sounds like the guitar is almost talking -- actually it sounds like it is saying ""surfing with the alien""). Joe is reputedly a technically awesome guitarist -- but I guess I found this self-indulgent."
5,To those critizicing the 80's sound of this album,"Of course, if you buy this album today it is going to sound 80's. It was recorded in the 80's!!! Some of the ratings here even complain that there is no singing!!! hahaha. That made me laugh. I can see why those who do not play guitar or think of Ashley Simpson when they hear the word ""music"" can't fathom the technical and musical skills featured on this album, but for those of us who do play, even though not many get to the level of Satriani, it was, back then, an incredible source of inspiration, an eye opener to endless possibilities. After I heard this album for the first time, I saw the guitar in a whole different way. There is much music out there these days, more ""modern"" sounding albums, new styles, etc. But you have to appreciate this album for what it is: one of the greatest, most influential 80's-instrumental-guitar albums."
5,No refuse in this C.D,Everything is perfect. This is the kind of C.D that makes like heavy metal for the first time. Every genuine musician will tell you.
5,more than great,this is one of the most jammen cd's ever. flying in a blue dream and this one are his best. i would highly recomend this to any guitar fan.
2,An interesting album which takes the Alien theme too far...,"Although this album has grown on me a little, I did not care for it when I first listened to it. It reminds me of the synthesizer-like background music used on 70's sci-fi shows - perhaps due to heavy doses of effects such as flangers and/or phasers(?). The album keeps the alien theme going throughout, which I find gets tedious. Things that are growing on me: the wooshing silver surfer effect on the title track, and ice 9 (it sounds like the guitar is talking -- saying ""surfing with the alien"") -- perhaps a Digitech Whammy-wah effect? Joe is reputedly a technically awesome guitarist and guitar teacher (Steve Vai and Kirk Hammet were pupils of his!) but this did not ""float my boat"". I am seeing a pattern with solo artists -- perhaps there is creative benefit to being in a band and interacting with other humans (rather than aliens?)!"
2,Half-transcends,"2 1/2Surely an important or influential electric solo guitar disc, but one whose tracks have only partially withstood the test of time. A select group of compositions extend melodics usually not found in the restrictive genre, helping to steer away from the collective 80's metal assault that still crept into much production and robbed at least half of SWTA from staying fresh."
3,Very overrated album,"After hearing so much about this album I had to see what the buzz was about and I'm still wondering. There is some good guitar playing but there is nothing memorable about the songs at all. If you like long, aimless, never-ending solos then go for it. Otherwise avoid this album like the plague."
1,90210 theme music at best,Are you kidding? I felt like putting on my acid-wash jeans and sitting by the fire with my girlfriend in her flashdance sweatshirt and stirrup pants. This is not music to appreciate - this is music to accompany some cheasy 80's movie or Aaron Spelling series.
5,A Must For Guitar players,"""Surfing..."" is an album that anyone who call's himself a rock guitar player should have. A masterpiece from guitar genius Joe Satriani. Amazing in all aspects, a lesson in guitar playing: Tremolo Bar techniques, Wah-wah, great legatos, harmonics, and of course, a great tapping lesson: Midnight.The only thing that could annoy somebody is the feeling that Satch is just too damned focused in his music, and makes no mistakes at all."
1,Guitar School Wanking Pays Off,"This is wanking at its most overwrought. No heart, no soul, just a bunch of mindless guitar school excercises, delivered with studio quality sterility. Only teenage guitar wannabes could find this interesting, and even they outgrow it soon enough. The rest of us who don't really care how fast one plays, how hard they push the whammy bar dives, will find this ""music"" nauseating. I got this CD as a gift, now it is my favorite beer coaster."
1,The Worst I've Ever Heard Him Do.,"A true sell-out embarrassment. I was shocked when I got this and slammed it in my player. Absolutely terrible - and this after Mark & Brian's glowing interview on 95.5 KLOS (Los Angeles) with Joe Satriani playing live. Jumped on my keyboard and ordered it immediately. Man, what a let down."
5,The best instrumental album I've ever heard,"Surfing with the Alien is the finest instrumental guitar album I've clapped ears on. Every song is a masterpiece. The stuff Satriani can do on a guitar is amazing.Even though I've listened to it many, many times, my jaw still drops at his fretboard shenigans on tracks such as Ice 9, Always With Me, Always With You, Circles, Lords of Karma, Echo... This is certainly one of the best albums I own.You really should buy 2 copies of it, one to listen to and one to keep in an air tight glass case to stick on your mantlepiece. It really is that good! I recommend this to anyone who wants to start off listening to instrumental rock."
4,Groovy,Very good solid rock album. Sounds are interesting. Satriani brought these legato flurries with him to the guitar scene. True masterpeace!
5,One of the best Satch albums ever.,"This album, along with Crystal Planet,the best Satriani has ever made. If you don't like this album, you've got a screw loose. I've been listening to it for twelve years, and I still can't get enough."
4,just ok,"My only complaint is that these wrist weights are very tight. I hope they'll loosen up after a while of wearing them, they are flexible afterall. I'm an average female, not especially blessed with thick or skinny wrists, and they are way too snug on my wrists."
1,Wrist weights WAY too small,"I am a small woman with very skinny hands and wrists -- could barely get these wrist weights on, even with much pulling and struggling. Very disappointed with product. They could use some more ""elasticity"". I had to throw them out."
3,A little on the small side.,I purchased these as a gift for someone with large hands/wrists. They said that the weights were hard to get on and cut off their circulation.
3,"I like them, but...","If you have large hands, you might not be able to get them on.But, they are a good weight for wearing at work and on walks.They were tight at first, but they seem better after multiple uses."
4,Perfect Size for Child (Therapy),"These are really too small for a medium-large framed woman. I also bought Valeo WW2 2-Pound Wrist Weights, and the Valeo are slightly larger than these Bell weights, and the Valeo are also a softer material. However, these Bell Softone weights are a perfect snug-but-not-tight fit for my 8 year old to wear on the wrists during therapy."
4,hand weights,"the set was what i expected. i don't use the product, it was a gift for my sister. she seems to be happy with it."
1,Turned my fingers purple,"I had to have help from my football playing son to remove the one torture device I managed to get on. I don't know why I didn't read the reviews first, I was in a hurry and just grabbed some wrist and ankle weights. I have officially learned my lesson.My wonderful husband has been trying to stretch them out for me, and the opening does look slightly larger. I am going to let him work on them a bit more before I risk it though. Who wants to try and get the blood pumping only to have it all get stuck in your hand?"
3,Softone size issue,"I really like the softone wrist weight, but I feel they should be offered in different sizes. They don't fit around my wrist. I slide them over a bottle after I use them to help stretch them out. I slide them over my hand and basically carry them. They are still easier to use that the type that have to be straped on."
5,Outstanding piece of Equipment,"I'd give this machine 10 stars if I could. At 46 i've been weight training/power lifting all my. I've been to and used a mulituide of gyms, gym equipment & home gyms, but this simple Lat machine is the best machine for the money. It only took about 1 hr. to assemble and you could literly assemble it from the picture alone. It's incredibly stable & the slide action is smooth as silk. Shipping was extremely prompt, however the box was torn in several places (that's Fed-Ex for ya) but their was no damage or missing parts. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to improve on a more dynamic workout and increased muscle gain, without a decrease in your wallets. A+++ to IncrediBody & Yukon for such a well built machine, at a cost much lower than the competition."
3,Don't believe the hype!,"Unlike the description above, this game ONLY includes the world cup tournament, which was not included in FIFA 2002 (its biggest fault).FIFA world cup looks nice, but isn't nearly as good as FIFA 2002. The gameplay isn't as interesting, there aren't as many moves and even though its supposed to be specific for the world cup - rosters and players aren't up to date. Replays and and play-by-play are a lot better, but thats not why we play the game. Its also too easy - I rented the game and less than half an hour later brought Mexico to the finals (playing at ""professional"" level).Bottom line - buy FIFA 2002 (a must), this one is a rental."
3,Slow in PS2,"The game is pretty cool, the new stuff about lobbing and making runs is awsome, but you can only play wolrd cup mode, and in PS2 it is pretty slow, mainly when you are in midfield.It also pauses randomly, i don't know if this is a known issue of the game"
4,Preview of FIFA 2003?,"I rented this masterpiece a few days ago and it is very fun if you have FIFA 2002. The game is visually beautiful and the stadiums look and feel like the real thing. Cheers to the design team on that one. The gameplay is identical except for the in-air ball control which has changed slightly. It takes some getting used to but once you have it somewhat mastered passing and shooting are a joy. Unfortunately for the price ... it's not worth it if you have FIFA 2002. The team section is limited and the tournament is short. I've won the cup with England and Brazil in a couple of hours which did unlock some additional teams to choose from - All Europe stars, and an All American stars side. All in all if you can find it for less than the usual price it's a good buy. If you are just a World Cup and FIFA fanatic, just get it.I have a feeling this is what 2003 will play and look like."
3,Disappointed.,"I am actually a big fan of soccer games especially from EA Sports since Word Cup 98. This World Cup 2002 is not as good as I expected really! The graphic is just the same as Fifa 2002. But World Cup 2002 has no any other option than Friendly mode and World Cup mode. In this game, you can't customise your own team or players. You only have to select the teams that had been qualified. Moreover, the worst thing that bothers me the most is you can't random your group in the first round. That means if you select Brazil, your first match will be playing with Turkey always! I mean always! I don't understand why EA Sports took this feature off. It's really a big mistake!Bottom line, if you are looking for a great soccer game in the market right now, don't buy this one. Go get Fifa 2002, and you won't be wasting your money like I did."
1,"Disappointing, low content","I did play this last version for the 2 last days (Alone and with friends). And I really feel that the FIFA series did not evolve at all since the last world cup. Graphics and music are flashy, I do love to watch ""between actions"" scenes, like the keeper getting mad after a goal and the interface is really cool. But well, playing chess is more funky and entertaining! Everything is perfect except the game, which is absolutely boring. I did enjoy it 2 hour, the time to score something like 100 goals... You just have to dash and shoot! Imagine a combat game with the craziest combos, with secret fireballs and pretty fighters ;) but where tapping one unique button repeatedly is the best way to win. It is the same for FIFA 2002...."
3,FIFA World Cup-not as good as it looks,"2002 FIFA World Cup is not as good as you may think it looks. First of all, scoring is difficult. You have to control where you are kicking when you don't KNOW where you are kicking it. Secondly, at the main menu, you have four options. Friendly Match(Exhibition), FIFA World Cup, Settings, and Bonus Material. And if you don't already know, international teams only play the FIFA World Cup. So pretty much, you can't be the Dallas Burn or LA Galaxy or D.C. United. And the World Cup is really short if you win it. It's not even ten games. Thirdly, you can't create players! I have FIFA Soccer 2000 and you can make players on it but not on world cup. This game is kind of a rip-off.Well, I hope this helps you guys!!"
5,Even Better then FIFA 2002,"I think the game play is even better then FIFA 2002. The graphics are awsome and the gameplay is quick and fluid.""The PlayStation 2 version of the game generally looks good. There are lively crowds holding national flags in the air. The stadiums are accurately modeled after their real-life counterparts and filled with plenty of detail. The player uniforms are all accurate, and some of the player models look like accurate representations of the actual player. The frame rate remains brisk throughout most of the game""I would recomend any soccar fan buy this game. It is the only game that you can actually play for the world cup. How good would a football game be if you couldn't play in the Super Bowl? The bottom line is that this game is the best soccar game out there."
2,Dont Waste Your Money,"They should just call this game what it is - an advirtisement for the 2002 World Cup. The gameplay options are very limited, there are no statistics kept on goals, bookings, etc. at least that i can see, and why the hell does the game go into slow motion so often? Also Amazons description of this title is misleading. There are no club teams and only 40 internationals plus whatever teams you unlock. I shouldve just bought FIFA 2002. Really apart from some beautifully detailed stadiums this just is not worth the money."
3,"World Cup 2002 , better than FIFA 2002?","No, is the answer to that question. I feel that compared to FIFA 2002, the gameplay is very poor, and there is far too much color in. The graphics seem to be an improvement, but the game on the whole doesnt seem to live up to the FIFA standard. I would advise a potential buyer of a football game to veer towards the non world cup range, as this reduces the whole game-playing enjoyment and addictivness factor, because in FIFA 2002 you can buy and sell players, control the players fully, (on World Cup 2002 the players had a habit of passing on their own accord) you can win leagues, trophies, and play in many amazing stadiums, were the color level is just right i feel. Speaking as a 15 year old game-a-holic, i feel that one buying a football game at the moment should be advised to wait for the release of FIFA 2003, or if you need a good football game now, buy FIFA 2002. I hope this review has been helpful. Hitman.:-)"
1,2002 FIFA World Cup.,"This game is the worst soccer game out there. There is only two modes, friendly and world cup. There is only 32 international teams or so. There is no HOLLAND, ROMANIA just to mention a few. There is how ever Iceland, Scotland. Two joke teams that did not qualify. No creation center, player-team editor!!!!.This title is a total waste of time and money avoid at all costs!!!!!. Stick to FIFA 2002. Also gameplay is horrid, major slow down....it just feels lame. Finally ignore any favourable reviews you see, these people do not know what they are talking about!!!!"
5,Believe,"Every child should receive this book as a gift. Very beautifully done. I work with kids and I have this book available for them to read. If they are touched by it, I give it to them as a gift."
4,Good bench for light workouts,"Only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that it is only rated for 300 lbs, otherwise, the adjustability is great"
2,no title,Box totaly destroyed. looks like it was a return that was not reboxed properly. Light surface rust on parts of the frame. It functions so it was not worth the hassel of returning it.
5,Great movie .,Sensitive subject matter for its time but well presented. I liked the movie better than the book. I would definately recommend this movie.
3,Forgetable War Drama with a Great Cast,"Frank Sinatra nad Tony Curtis star as two GI friends who both love a young french girl played by Natalie Wood (who keeps loosing her accent during different scenes). The the three of them cast in this forgetable film is worth three stars by itselfSinatra seem too old to play Wood's love interest. Curis seem too perfect in this role as the blues playing GI in the thick of war.... and Wood-see last paragraphThe world war two melodrama is soapy at best. AS I said before, there are very few suprises in this film, except for the acting of Sinatra and Curtis who outshine the scriptFoe Sinatra and Curtis fans only!Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
4,No kings and so forth.,This is one of the lesser known Natalie Wood films but she is always a pleasure to watch. The story line attempts to handle one of the major prejudices of the time against a WWII background but stumbles a little. If you want to see a good war movie this is not it. Frank Sinatra and Tony Curtis carried their roles very well except they were not very kingly. The picture quality of the film is very good. All in all this is a good film if your looking for a little drama rather than an action movie.
1,"dull, disjointed, and dishonest","As someone who has read a lot about Thailand of the 1960s, I found this novel difficult to bear. Worse still, it struck me as dull and disjointed. It inexpertly tries to weave together the mystery of ""Silk King"" Jim Thompson's disappearance with the unhappy marriage of a strangely spaced-out American housewife enduring life in the midst of ""exotic"" Bangkok. Throw in a murder and the muddle is complete. The fiction seems oddly amateur, the history uninformed, and the descriptions of Thailand and Thai customs come straight out of a second-rate guidebook. The decision to include ""Siam"" in the title seems crass and dishonest as the novel has nothing to do with Siam. Tuck appears guilty of breaking the cardinal rule of beginning writers: write about what you know. Tuck demonstrates that she knows very little about the setting or circumstances of this novel. I rarely dislike any book about Thailand. I guess for that reason, this novel is special."
3,Read it by the pool in Thailand,"This is a book to read by a pool in Bangkok, before going to visit Jim Thompson's house or the Royal Palace and heading to a nice restaurant. By no means deep, it catches well the flavor of Thailand, and Claire, the main character, is definitely not the most interesting heroine in litterature. Nonetheless, there is some suspense and we get an idea of the Thai monarchy, its recent history, some of the complexities of this beautiful country, and what it means to be an expat in Bangkok. Things haven't changed much since the late sixties. I liked it, though."
2,"Educational, but not creative","I read this book and and found it to be a tedious endeavor. The main character(she was so empty headed and dull, I can't even remember her name), well, she wanted to know what happened to this wealthy man that ran a silk company. He had been abducted, this bothers the character very badly, and what makes the book kind of a downer, you'd think the main character would find out what happened to the guy, but in the end... oh well, you can figure out what I'm trying to say. Well, the prose was very noncreative and flat, but she did have an eye for observation and wrote the settings and atmosphere of the novel convincingly. She made you feel as if you were in Thailand. Another thing, if you like traveling, this might be the book for you, Ms Lily Tuck did a good job of explaining Thailand. But if you are expecting poetic imagery, or a explosive plot, you might not like this book."
4,Book club purchase,I needed to purchase the book for my book club and the price was right and the timing was great. The order was sent out to me in plenty of time.
1,Siam: The Woman Who Shot a Man,"Upon reading this book, I was totally amazed that it received such glowing editorial reviews. It was one of the most ridiculous novels I have ever read. The author, in my opinion, used the format of the novel to expound upon her knowledge of Thailand, however, not in an interesting manner.The book had very little plot and, I felt, very little characterization. If one would enjoy reading about the main character's Thai language lessons, excerpts from her readings of Thai history and architecture, and her endless ruminations about the disappearance of a man that she met once - then you would immensely enjoy this novel."
5,A very good cable,Good packaging and easy to install (some cheap cables are not easy to install).Very good quality and the cable seems to be reliable.No complaints so far. I highly recommend it.
5,Digital cable TV split signal through this cable,"I used this short cable to split the digital signal from my cable TV box to the signal splitter in order to run a TV input to a computer system. The cable was easy to install and required only finger pressure to adequately tighten the cable connection on the cable box and to the AR signal splitter. While I read that as much as 50 percent of the signal power can be lost through splitting the signal, my regular cable TV signal is running quite nicely with no noticeable difference that I can determine. I'm just a computer geek and haven't done much with TV signals in quite a few years, but I'm pleased with the cost and performance."
4,No complaints - great product,"I don't know how complicated it can be. Its just a piece of coaxial cable, and it does the job like it should."
5,Clear,"This cable provides a clean, clear picture. It secures well to your TV and unit. They do a great job, and the price is great!"
2,A'Ight At Best.. Unless You LIke Biographies,"OK First of All IM NOT A KID I'm just to lazy to sign in. Anyway I was in NY this past weekend and I saw someone who was selling CD;s on the street that WERE NOT Bootlef [Amazing To See In NY] anyway they were used CD's ranging from $8-$3 per disc. Anyway since I'm a DJ i decided to buy a s**T load of music and i saw this CD for $3 so i grabbed it assuming it was a new release or old music but I was sure people would wanna hear it so when i got into my car i tested the discs out [They were used so you can't be sure] and this is just interviews and info about her so i personally dont like it, my girl somewhat enjoy's it but she of course prefers her music if your a gwen fan get it but if you just want music... Don't Waste Your Time. It's actually a pretty good biography i fyou like that kinda thing so we'll just i recomend you only buy it if you kno its not music.[Another Half Asleep/Hung Over Review By]***DJ C.I.***"
4,Love It!!,"This sarong is just great. The pattern is just what I wanted and expected. The fabric is very nice and I'm sure I'll get a lot of use out of it this summer. Watch out for the shipping charges though. I am a new Prime member with Amazon and I assumed the shipping was included. When I got the bill I found out otherwise after I received it. I contacted the seller and complained because the charges were so high and I never heard a word back from them. Live and learn, I guess."
2,Copy and Paste,"I believe that this text & its review is a money-maker item, published for the sole purpose of gaining profits. It seems as if the author mainly copied and pasted old data to accomplish his goal of completing a book for monetary purposes. The valuable information provided could have been handled in the form of a 2-3 page article, providing that the author and company, did not intend to profit form this book. Any monies earned from this book should be used to stimulate the economy and/or as a donation to the students paying for it. I am not saying that Mr. Fullan is completely responsible or that some of his information is not credible, but why not use it as a paper-back to the Educatinal Leadership (2nd Ed.) book provided for schools."
2,Functional,"The title is mis-leading since the book is actually already dated. The insights are fine, but the material is not as relevant to the current, 2013, changing landscape of education."
3,No Dolly Parton,"This was a good dvd and rather funny however even though Dolly is mentioned on the back of the DVD along with a few other people, she nor others are actually in the movie though there are a few jokes poked fun at them."
3,Bob Hope Christmas Classics,I love Bob Hope and all the wonderful things he did in his life time. Most of the video brought back pleasant memories sitting in front of the TV with my family. The sitting at his home with friends and family was disapointing and non professional. I think a single narrator would have been much more effective.
3,"Bob Hope Christmas years, Parts","I too grew up watching the Bob Hope Chritmas shows, even saw most of his movies on TV. This DVD was ok but there wasn't much to it. We start with Bob talking at the begining of some of his shows. One joke for each show. Then we have the fake gathering at a stage house with Mrs Hope, She is great and a great singer also. A few stars show up to talk about the show they were in with Bob. Loni Anderson, Barbra Eden, The Judds, football stars, an actor and Joey Larence. The best part was the few sketches with Red Skelton and Jack Benny, that was great stuf. And the Silver Bells with about five different stars of the day.The shows over seas for the armed forces was good to see. Oh and there was Brook Shelds also, they loved her legs. Thanks Bob"
4,A Great New Stitch to Add to Your Repertoire,"Camel crochet creates a fabric that closely resembles knitted ribbing, with a bit less sideways stretch than knitted ribbing.I think it makes a much more attractive ribbing than traditional crochet ribbing techniques. I have used it on a sweater in place of the ribbing stitch the pattern called for, and I was very pleased with the results."
2,Not like an eagles album,"If you have listened to a lot of eagles stuff, you'll notice a couple things. A. Don Felder is a HELL of a guitarists, and B. his vocals are mostly in the harmonies.Airborne still has that really good guitar. But the guitar does not cut this album, after the first two minutes you'll realize that you really didn't care that there is great guitar. Felders underproduced sometimes pitchy vocals are somewhat annoying.The album is produced awfully and things simply aren't mixed well. There are no stand out songs and evrything sounds the same. There is a lot of synthetic instruments playing so the album is pretty dated.The album has it's moments, and I feel that most eagles fans would like adding this sick rarity almost inaccessible CD to you're collection, but this disc sounds nothing like the eagles and really has no point."
1,not great,"I have used a lot of waxes (both hard and soft) in the past, and this product is not that great when compared to others. Does not grab on to hair that is thick or shorter than a quarter of an inch."
5,"Great product, not too painful","I liked it. I liked the epilation oil that comes with the kit - I think it really works to soften the skin. This stuff doesn't make me break out like other products have. It does miss a few hairs, so tweezing afterwards is always needed. And all the used up wax makes a big mess. And - I'm kinda clumsy - it drips on me. But it works, and doesn't hurt as bad as I thought it would!"
2,total let down,bird non existant in 2nd half. expected some amazing showdown since it was this game and not the michigan game vs magic that was on sale.
5,Beautiful,"This is beautiful, quiet, contemplative jazz, with fine interaction between two master artists well suited for each other."
1,These headphones are the worst,"I purchased these headphones to use with my portable mp3 player. Technically, I purchased the HP-700 model which does not fold, but I assume they are similar.Right on the packaging, it says ""Gold plated mini-plug"" yet the plug is NOT gold-plated at all, it is in fact a standard nickel-plated mini plug. The sound is incredibly tinny and even with the volume control is lower volume than my Sony headphones without the volume control. In addition, the plug does not create a tight fit with the player, so that as you move on a cardio machine, it slides around and causes static and lack of sound in the headphones.This is the second pair of Maxell headphones I have had trouble with in the past 6 months. I have learned my lesson. NO MORE MAXELL!"
1,Don't buy these.,These sound terrible. I bought the same model number a few years ago and love them. Needed a second pair. What happened to this product?
2,Jersey Ragtop...,The shirt ran a little big... and this merchant does not allow for returns or exchanges ... I will not purchase from again.
2,This is not what I thought,I thought this was for the old atari system 2600. When I got this game it did not fit in the system. Very disappointed. I used to love this game when I was a kid.
2,Amateurish,I really thought this would be a book to add to my studies of Germany during the period of the Third Reich. Not to be. The narrative is very amateurish and sounds more like a script directed at the mentality of people who enjoy watching commercial television. A big disappointment but maybe they thought that would help to sell more books.
3,good produc,"Good good product only mind that the game is not very maneuverable, but everything in there but this well for any minor child."
1,uhhhhhhhh,"Ok first the only fun part is when cars crash and go flying, otherwise it isn't to much fun. The music can be compared to ameteur musician players. The graphics are great but thats not enough to compete with anything else. Heres how I rate it.Fun 3/10This won't keep you entertained for longMusic 2/10Just so bad, Not even realGraphics 9/10They are solid, but who cares when the game stinksTracks 3/10BoringCars 5/10They are just okOverall 4/10It's not worth buying... But renting is ok, I guess??"
1,Not worthy of Gamecube,"The graphics on this game appear to have been ported from code written for a machine of much less capability than the GameCube. The soundtrack sounds like it was recorded for a 1970's arcade game. The play may be good but this game does not take advantage of the GC the way Sonic or Luigi do. However, if you cannot wait for a racing game worthy of the GC, you are sort of stuck with this one, as I am."
5,Bam! Entertainment is back,"I have to would've given it 4.5 stars, because the other games from Bam! Entertaiment [is] so bad, but the game is new. The game is probally one the best games Bam! Entertainment made. I tried a game called Formula One for racing game and it [was not good].My rating1 out of 5, 5 is the best4.8= controlling5=gameplay5=graphics"
2,Not Ideal,I was hoping to get a pair for shadow boxing but these turned out to be really flimzy... Not at all like gloves. They slip around your hands and you cannot truly get a grip on it.
2,An overly cerebral history of the universe.,"This book is for dominant left-brain people. Whereas Brian spun fact and poetry together into the classic 'The Universe is a Green Dragon', this book fails to enchant in the telling of what should be a very enchanting story.What we are seeing here is the scientist mind overshadowing the poet. Unless you don't know much about the Big Bang through Hawking or the theory of evolution, this book is a miss."
4,"Excellent detailed account of the ""Great Patriotic War""","This is an excellant book for those seeking detailed accounts of the war between the USSR and Germany. Mr. Erickson does a masterful job of detailing the Soviet failures at the beginning of the war through their successful defense of Moscow to the fall of the Crimea setting the stage for Germany's catastrophic defeat at Stalingrad. This account is largely from the Soviet perspective, but I do not believe that detracts from its value. The author displays little bias, he rather lets the facts speak for themselves. This has one weakness: as others have said, it has no maps. The lack of maps make it somewhat difficult to follow unless one has some idea of the geography of the USSR; even then, it is still difficult to follow at times. However, overall this is an excellent work for anyone seeking more detail about the Great Patriotic War."
3,OK but not the best,"If you've read the rest of the Skolian books you'll need to read this one, but don't expect a lot of your questions to be answered. The story focuses solely on Kelric after he leaves Coba, and we see very little of the rest of the family. Kelric does learn some interesting bits of information about the Aristos though that make the book worth reading.But if you're expecting romance like Ms. Asaro has had in her other books, you'll be disappointed. This book is a boy's fantasy, full of compelled sex with and by slaves, fully described. There is one romance that comes close to redeeming all this, but it's a small part of the book.Buy it if you've bought all the others, but if you haven't, read the others first."
2,Ascendent Sun,"The story was great, as usual, but the were so many transcriptiom errors (hundreds) in this Kindle version that it wasn't worth the price of the download"
4,He's Lovin' it.,I bought this for My Husband for X-mas and he plays it all the time so i would say he loves it.
3,OK,"OK, BUT SAVE YOUR MONEY AND PICK UP GRAN TURISMO 3 FOR 19.95 NEW; AN INSANE PRICE FOR THE BEST DRIVING GAME EVER!!!!!!!!"
4,The Best F1 game since World Gran Prix,This is easily the most well rounded F1 game since N64's World Grand Prix. This game will take quite some time to learn just the basics and memorize the tracks(if your new to them). Dont expect to breeze around the turns on your first try. This is not a cheesy game like Gran Turismo that has not one bit of realism in it. This is real racing! I give it 4 stars just because there are a few bugs with the rules system. 1.) if you are leading under yellow you can get a penalty for passing. How? 2.)You can get a penalty for dangerous driving if a guy slams you from behind?...Behond that this game is excellent and Im happy to have something finally rival that old N64 classic.
4,Needs context,"I devour Stalingrad books, and have them all, good and bad. This one is in the middle, its okay. For me its flaw is that it's very hard to place the events described within context because they deal with combat half-way through the battle itself but also before either the Soviet counter-offensive or the Luftwaffe air-lift start. It reads well, has good photos and is indeed quite interesting, but I do think that the book should only be read after the reader has studied the two essential Stalingrad classics: Antony Beevor's ''Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege'' and Joel Hayward's ''Stopped at Stalingrad.''"
4,Forgotten Greats,Whiskey Train is a little known but GREAT blues rock number. The dark side of Harum tends to be self indulgent and pompous but egocentricity is a staple of the artistic community and forgivable. The entire album and band stands out as part of the history of Contemporary Pop music. This album is part of the pre-history of non pretty music which foreshadowed much of the angst music that followed. A Great Album and far from a triviality.
3,A feel good movie,This movie is a great family movie and because it is based on a true story not everything makes you happy. I gave it a 3 because of the casting. They just didn't seem to fit. Local people were fine but known stars not so much.
3,I enjoyed the movie,I would reccoment this movie to others. Loved the story line you just hope they directors followed the real story and they didn't add to make the movie better in their eyes.
4,I truly enjoyed this,"I truly enjoyed this movie, partly because I remember the event in 1988. It was one of those events that sucked people in (like that girl who fell down the well or the miner's in South America). I couldn't get the news fast enough so I had a buddy of mine create a thing called the ""Internet"" so news could be gotten quicker. John Krazinski was quite good as was, dare I say it, Drew Barrymore. I didn't care much for Kristen Bell's character. I felt bad for the whales and was sucked into the story yet again."
2,Big Miracle,"Predictable, but a good story for a child towatch in order to teach believing one can do anything and anything is possible. Good animal story."
5,Awesome Movie,this is an awesome movie. this movie is based on a true story where three whales two adults and thier baby gets traped in the ice and fights for thier lives. when a news caster descovers that the whales are in trouble he broadcast it all over the news. when people descover how much the whales need help they help them. this was a really good movie and was heartwarming. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
5,Good family movie,Wonderful heartwarming movie! So nice to see a non-violent movie with a beautiful message. A perfect movie to watch with the family.
3,Watch with the kids,"It was a feel good movie that we enjoyed.It didnt hold the attention of our kids very well though. For a family movie with kids 10 or older, give it a shot."
4,Family Friendly,"I saw this movie at a Movie Tavern with my wife and 5 yr old daughter. Have to say it was an enjoyable movie based on true events that I vaguely remember. The story centers around the efforts of a small, remote town in the northernmost point in Alaska to save a whale family trapped beneath the quickly freezing ice. The story gains national and international attention and many different people from around the country converge on the town in an attempt to free the trapped whales.The movie does a nice job in sending an environmental/work together message without being too heavy handed and preachy. There aren't too many over the top/unnecessary melodramatic conflicts and the story rightly remains centered around the efforts to rescue the whales. The performances are all good, save that Drew Barrymore is overacting a bit. This is no special effects spectacular, just a nice little movie that is enjoyable to watch and certainly family friendly. Easy to recommend"
4,Big Miracle,This is a great movie. My children are both in to animals and making sure they were safe. I thought there were positive messages in this movie.
5,Very uplifting movie!!,The fact that this was based on a true story made the movie for me. Very uplifting as it portrays peoples' willingness to help animals as we all should.
5,Wonderful family film,"Touching, sometimes funny, sometimes sad. I really enjoyed seeing the real newscasts from the event. Brokaw, Jennings, Rather. And, what a hoot, the future governor of Alaska. And wonderful to see so many different people coming together for these incredible creatures. Too bad we can't all do that for everything."
1,Blue Ray DVD Combo Pack?,"This is NOT a combo pack! There is 1 disc included, with the Blue Ray on one side and the DVD on the other. Besides that one side of the disc is bound to get destroyed, the main purpose of getting a combo pack is because people have both Blue Ray and DVD players. This ""Combo Pack"" will do you no good when your machines are in two different locations because the destributor didn't want to spring the extra nickel for another disc. Rest easy though, I'm sure they'll tell you it's for the ""environment""; as they explore every possible avenue to get the most money out of you"
4,Big Miracle Drew Barrymore,"I had been looking for this DVD but couldn't remember it's title. Once Amazon showed it, I knew I had to get it. I love these movies with real life saving events."
3,Way too political...,"Was a good movie plot and had a lot of good ideas and plot twists in it. However, it was filled with so much anti-Republican-politics and anti-Reaganism that the other parts of the movie got drowned out by the screaming rhetoric, regardless of your party affiliation or which side your political views fell on. They could have very easily played up certain parts of the movie that were of real interest and played down the trumpet section a little and had a much better movie."
4,Whales,Ok so I rented this movie to watch a feel good movie. Let me start and tell you their are some top actors and actress's in this movie. Lots of them. The movie is centered around whales which is great because we all love God's creatures. So you will enjoy the movie but there are some LONG drawn out scenes that seem to be put in here just to make the movie longer. Its worth renting for the great parts especially for kids 8-12 but dont forget to keep your phone near for the added length parts of the movie. (the kids wont catch it but you will). Its not a buying type movie but worth renting.
3,Slow,Was a good movie but it was very slow getting here. Don't understand why it takes a hole five days before it leaves your place before it is allowed to be shipped.
3,Enjoyable,I enjoyed the movie. I had forgotten about the true story and it was nice to be reminded. The Greenpeace character was a little over the top.
4,"Tea: Yes, please, more!","Overall, a really great feel good story, with a variety of characters and great dialogue that had me laughing and choking up along the way. I always know a story is good, if I'm talking back to the screen.This movie is inspired by a true story, and follows the trials of a tiny town in Alaska as they band together, to help save some whales who go stuck in the ice, along with the Eskimos, U.S. Government, National Guard, Green Peace, and even the USSR makes an appearance. I know, unlikely bed-fellows, who end up working together to help free the whales from the ice.I was surprised by how good this story was. It grabbed me, got my heart even, and wouldn't let go. And I adored the unique and different characters. Variety in characters is so important. And amusing dialogue, good casting, and good pacing.This is also a pretty good family movie, though the baby whale ends up not making it.I would purchase this, and re-watch it."
2,"The GF made me, and that's the only reason I watched.","My gf made me watch this because it was filmed in Alaska and she is from Alaska. That was about it to this movie. Hippie Drew Barrymore was pretty annoying, and the only part I enjoyed were the two Minnesota guys who made the de-icing machine.Dont watch unless you must. This movie is really sappy."
4,good one,this is a very good family movie. it also appears as though the movie has some truth to it. good save the whales movie.
4,Big Miracle,This was a good movie and I like any movie based on reality.I don't like Drew Barreymore but this was all right.
4,a real miracle,A really beautiful movie. I love movies about animals. It was sad once and turned about to be a happy ending and I love this.
3,A little boring,It's a nice story but was kind of boring. I know they were probably trying to stick to the true story but it needed something to liven it up a bit.
3,Great Family Film,"Even though this was a ""soft"" movie, I enjoyed it because of the positive outcome and the caring for Nature's creatures large and small. A good film to watch with the family. There are indeed good deeds in this world. Wouldn't it be nice if we were aware of it more?"
3,Didn't watch whole movie,What i did watch was a little bit corny. Meh. I would maybe watch again if it came on TV.
2,How to Read - Overkill!,"If you've never been instructed on how to read a textbook before getting to college, then this is for you. It's like beating that dead horse over and over again. The detailed ""thought processes"" with examples don't even include the transitional words that clue you in to what the process is. Contradicts itself often. This had to be someone's Ph.D. thesis. If I didn't have to take this course, I'd never pick up this book."
1,Never Received My Order,"I really wanted to see this movie, that's why I purchased it, so I could watch it. So far, it has not arrived. Hopefully someday it will appear in my mail box and I can do a proper review. My friend, Jay Tavare, is in this film, and he was the reason that I purchased it in the first place."
2,sappy movie,"this movie was a bit far fetched. the actress who played the sister over acted. the cop and both indian guys were hot!a+ for them.even the older american indian was a cutey!good movie for kids, better than spirit of the eagle."
5,Return to Grizzly Mountain,It was a wonderful movie that went back in time to the days of the pioneers were a bear cub could run free and be safe. The scenery was spectacular and majestic and I would reccommeen it to anyone especially a family. The actors were all wonderful and they did a good job. The ending is left open for two sequels going either direction. I am looking forward to future movies from the prodcers.PS thanks for the wonderful movie. Thank you amazon.com for your couteous services.
2,Not for me.,Well what can I say? I guess I was suffering from nostalgia for Grizzly Adams but believe me this is definitely not the cure. If you're seven years old or younger I guess you could suffer through it but it is not for grown ups. Pass on this one.
3,fantasy poorly done,"we loved the bear cub and the boyand his love for a captured bear.then movie oozes of spiritualismand indian lore poorly done.......i would have liked to see the movieedited, used the fast forward buttona lot. not sure if i will let mygrandson watch it again. should haveread the reviews more closely. i dependon them prior to movie selection..."
1,B is for Bad,I was execting the Best of Sesame Street but this was not. this is 3 DVDs Anniversery in music (which I kept) And then Elmo and Zoe go on an adventure with letters and numbers. I was expecting the best old skits and re-accuring muppets but it is crap. I sold them at a second had store for 2 bucks each. Sad.
1,Not happy,"I had looked for a very long time for one of the songs on this C.D. Well wouldn't you know the one that was so precious skips during the whole song. I should know better than to purchase used. Be careful when buying used!!!!!!!!! Enemy's Camp is really,really bad and such a wonderful tune."
5,TIME TO SHINE,"THIS IS A GREAT RECORD, i HAD NO IDEA THIS GUY HAD SO MUCH TALENT! HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WRITING HIS EX BANDS MATERIAL BY HIMSELF...MAYBE THEY WOULD HAVE STILL BEEN AROUND........LIKE IT MUCH BETTER THIS WAY............."
2,Not trixter,"If you liked Pete as Trixter's lead singer, you won't like this album. Gave it a chance and probably won't listen to it ever again. Doesn't sound at all like I expected from Trixter."
4,Introduction to Melville,"Redburn refers to the main character of the novel Wellingborough Redburn, a young lad from New York who embarks on his first voyage to England as a member of the sailing crew. It is the story of lost innocence, breaking away from the comforts of home and country to experience life on one's own. Melville captures poetically, Redburn's journey, observations, feelings, and dark reality of life in pre-civil war America and England. If you have never read Melville before, this is a page turning introduction to a very much admired author. His style of writing is poetic, and clever and his narrative captures the feelings and thoughts of the time. I highly recommend it."
3,"A great story, worth reading","""If journals interest you, than by all means this is an excellent book"" Heck yes,journals interest me- especially sea journals. Though this may not be a book for literary snobs, i enjoyed it very much. The story is supposed to be fiction, but I could easily believe Melville was describing scenes that he had personally witnessed. It must have been like writing his own journal, with keen insights into strange human quirks and scattered with observations about social issues like poverty and immigration. Not every book has to be a masterpiece to be worth reading! I just finished reading Billy Budd, and it was heavy going compared to the simpler language of Redburn."
1,A Literary HORROR,"Let's get real here folks. This book is a literary disaster. Does the reviewer above want to argue that with me? Well, than he or she can talk to Melville himself. Melville wrote this book for money. It doesn't have the literary charm that comes with Melville's books. Moby Dick was a literary masterpiece. Redburn is garbage. It is simply a journal of his travels to Liverpool and back. If journals interest you, than by all means this is an excellent book. But this book was not written by Melville, rather by his quest for money while he was in poverty. I would give it negative stars, but Amazon.com doesn't give that as an option."
4,THE LOVE STORY OF A WEDDING SINGER IN THE 80's,"SO IT'S PREDICTABLE. WHO CARES. IF THINGS WOULD'VE HAPPENED ANY DIFFERANTLY, YOU'D BE UPSET THINGS DIDN'T TURN OUT THE WAY YOU HOPED. SANDLER IS LEFT HIGH AND DRY BY HIS FIANCEE. HE GOES INTO DEPRESSION MODE. BARRYMORE IS ENGAGED TO A REAL CREEP. SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT... THERE ARE ALOT OF TERRIFIC SUPPORTING CHARACTERS TO FALL IN LOVE WITH, LAUGH AT, OR WANT TO KILL. CHRISTINE TAYLOR IS WONDERFUL AS A 80's MADONNA CLONE. IF YOU CAN KEEP A STRIAGHT FACE WHILE WATCHING ALEXIS ARQUETTE'S BOY GEORGE IMPRESSION, YOUR NOT HUMAN. ALL AND ALL ""THE WEDDING SINGER"" IS AN ENJOYABLE ROMANTIC COMEDY FULL OF STICKY TREATS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN BEFORE YOU EVER STUCK IT IN YOUR PLAYER."
4,A great movie!,"I really enjoyed this film, it has a my favorite actor Adam Sandler, who shows a different side of him in this movie. Drew Barrymore also gave a nice performence. The movie just seemed so natural, and life like. The story is a great. Its a good love story between Sandler and Barrymore. The ending is just terrific."
5,The Wedding Singer...PRETTY GOOD!,"The Wedding Singer is a great romantic comedy that takes place in 1985. Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler) is a wedding singer, that was supposed to get married, but the marriage was called off when his fiance' never showed up. But he finds a girl name Julia (Drew Barrymore) which he likes better anyways. But you see, the problem is that Julia is supposed to get married also, but to a man who cheats on her, yet she doesn't know that. The story ends with the two, Julia and Robbie falling in love and geting married. Some of the DVD feature's are: Karaoke Bar (including Billy Idol-White Wedding, Sugar Hill Gang-Rapper's Delight, and a bunch of other 80's songs). The DVD has both widescreen and fullscreen versions of the film, 80's music trivia game, cast boigraphies and filmograhies, and a wedding album (photo gallery of the movie). If you like good, clean, fun comedy, i definetely recommend this DVD!!!"
5,The Best Movie,I don't care what anyone else says this was a great movie. I have seen it at least 5 times. It is so great I would recommend it. Drew Barrymore and Adam sandler are both very funny. If you are a fan of either one I would go see it.
2,"The more I think about it, the less I like it.","I didn't mind this movie when I saw it, but afterwards I thought ""That was really lame!""Adam Sandler's character was a complete wimp (what happened to Happy Gilmore?) and Drew Barrymore was a drip.This was a big hit with a lot of young people, which is a bit hard to understand because a lot of them wouldn't remember 1985."
1,wedding singer dvd,no use to me as live in ireland so twas the wrong region wont work.have ordered books i need for a course and am still waiting a few weeks later.assignments will be completed by time the books come
4,Okay movie,This was more of a love movie between Sandler and Drew Berrymorethis and Ok movie to have from Adam Sandler this is good I guessStory 6 Acting 7 Directing 8 Action 7 Entertainment 7Overall=35/50 wich because of the old lady who sings rappers Delight I will reward it 4 stars and plus its Sandler.
2,Not the worst,"It's one of the better Sandler movies, but that's not saying much. After Billy Madison & Happy Gilmore, Sandler lost any kind of edge that he had. He wants us viewers to love him too much, abandoning the wackiness. I miss the old Sandler. The Wedding Singer had potential, and the 80's is a ripe target for a comedy. Unfortunately, instead of being a parody of 80's romantic comedies, The Wedding Singer reilies on same lame plot devices. Go see Billy Madison for the hundreth time instead of this wasted oportunity."
2,This COULD HAVE been such a great movie!!!,"The general story of this movie is great...but there are just enough vulgar parts to turn me off. I don't know what it is about most Adam Sandler movies, but why is it that he can be so sweet and charming one minute and then be so crude you just want to slap his face? (He was like that in Happy Gilmore, too) The movie is cast well and the retro music is great. It's too bad someone didn't try to clean up the movie a little bit before it got released, because it could have been one of those few that is funny, sad, and romantic all at the same time."
5,Great Movie,"I love Adam Sandler, he's funny and in this movie was not too lude. Drew Barrymore's a funny sweetheart. The movie was not trashy, it was just a good, funny movie."
3,Cute movie,"I watched this movie as research, as I costumed a stage production of it at a local school. It's a cute movie, though I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have selected it as a film I would want to personally watch just for fun."
3,entertaining but tries a bit too hard,"Good underlying story line and good guy wins theme that is refreshing. On the down side there are way too many out of place crude lines and gestures. The sheer number of these is what makes it seem like the movie is ""trying too hard"". Sandler shows a new and very good side of his acting ability."
5,Sandlar is good,Adam plays a great role and is funny but not as funny in other movies a great side we have not seen that much. A funny movie but not as funny as WaterBoy.
4,DVD Sing-along was fun. Like him? Like her? Love it.,"Do you like Adam Sandler? Do you like Drew Barrymore? Answer either of these yes and you'll like this movie. Answer both yes and you'll love this movie. Don't be pretentious, just enjoy, then sing the songs on the DVD. The language is a little harsh for under 10. Wake the wife for Billy Idol."
5,Fantastic movie!,"This movie has everything...comedy, romance, fun soundtrack. All you Children Of The 80s will love the ""MTV generation"" pop culture jokes and references. If Adam Sandler made more movies like this and fewer of the ""Big Daddy"" types, he'd be my favorite actor."
5,Oldie but Goodie,One of our favorite fun movies. I shared it with my 12 year old and he loved seeing the 80's and the stuff we grew up with.
4,The 80's Just Got A Facelift,"I have to disagree with some of the other reviews stating that this movie didn't have a decent transfer as I see it as one of the finest looking Blu-rays in my entire collection. The 80's scheme is vibrant with near perfect contrast and saturated colors. This movie isn't meant to look grainy or natural, it's meant to look synthetic and completely out of this world which is the exact effect this beautiful HD conversion had on The Wedding Singer.It is however lacking in extra content, so much to the point that the movie autoplays like a menuless VHS tape because the only real special feature this disc has is a backstage examination of the Broadway musical The Wedding Singer."
3,"BUSCEMI, BUSCEMI, BUSCEMI !","THE WEDDING SINGER raises an important question for those who, like me, are movie fans since their chidlhood : to spend two hours laughing and having good time in front of your television is that a proof that the movie you're watching is a good one or not ? Undoubtedly, Drew Barrymore and Steve Buscemi are terrific in THE WEDDING SINGER. For sure, the music is the cause of the nostalgia you feel in your very heart. Furthermore, the ending is a pure Hollywood style weeping moment. Nevertheless this movie is nothing more than a suite of small comic scenes or one-(wo)man-shows put one after the other. You can call it whatever you want but certainly not a movie. For a simple reason : there is no style in it. A DVD to rent for an evening with friends."
5,Best Sandler movie yet...,"This movie is as sweet and funny as they come. Is the basic plot cliched? Sure... Are the 80's spoofs totally blatant? You bet... It is the stars of this movie that make it so great. Adam and Drew are absolutely adorable together, and make this movie as fantastic as it is. Drew has never been more lovable. And anyone who grew up in the 80's, like myself, will love the nostalgia that this movie brings with it. All that, and it's pretty darn funny, too..."
4,Surprisingly good,"I admit I was skeptical. From the look at Adam Sandler's resume I was expecting a pointless waste of film. Instead I found a Sandler who was (could it be?) almost an adult. I found that the chemestry between him and Barrymore was absolutely worth seeing. Its fun to watch people make fun of themselves, hense the cameo from Billy Idol. I'm in love with 80's movies and this one goes at the top of my list (even though it was made in the 90's)."
4,"It's stupid, but you'll laugh anyway.","The story line is very cliche. But there are two or three scenes that make it all worthwhile. I still laugh thinking about them - a couple months after watching the video. I want to watch it again, but I may fast-forward to those scenes."
5,movie purchase,this is a great movie every time I watch it. love adam sandler and drew barrymore together
3,Not At His Finest,"This Adam Sandler movie is by far the worst one he has been involved in, close second would be ""Little Nikki"". This movie tried to be a little too cute while trying to keep the Sandler type of humor working throughout. I still gave it three stars because it is an Adam Sandler movie and because there were a couple of funny sceens in it."
4,A nice day for a white wedding...,"This is a typical Adam Sandler movie--full of laughs and entertainment. If you like revisiting the 80s with the music--Boy George, Billy Idol and Frankie Goes to Hollywood, you'll enjoy this. Adam plays a wedding singer that was stood up at the altar. Drew Barrymore play a waitress that is about to marry a ""Miami Vice"" wannabe. As you may have guessed the two realize they were meant for each other and the rest is pure good entertainment. It was fun to reminisce about those 80s. I'm a wedding photographer and I must say the kind of gigs the wedding singer did and the people he encountered, were so typical and realistic--especially table 9! Anyways, not the most technically perfect movie, but full of good Adam Sandler comedy. I had to watch this movie again. I laugh a lot everytime I see it..."
5,Early Adam Sandler Classic,"Adam Sandler plays sweet guy Robbie Hart in mid 1980's New Jersey. In my opinion, this is one of Sandler's best pictures (Happy Gilmore was the other classic). He's not a mega-blockbuster funnyman yet who's trying to be overly pretentious & hilarious here... maybe that's what draws me to this movie. Drew Barrymore is great as Julia, his friend and eventual wife (I was never a Barrymore fan until this movie). Some great scenes... Hart singing ""Love Stinks"" at one of his gigs; Hart on a few ocassions getting the best of Julia's ... boyfriend; Hart singing his soulful incomplete love song about his 'ex' to Julia; and Robbie's bandmate singing Culture Club's ""Do You Really Want To Hurt Me"" (twice). Sandler has a heart in this movie... he has wit, charm, and an unquitting character. Nice cameo by Mr.""Dancin' With Myself"", Billy Idol, and a great soundtrack - if you grew up liking 80's music."
1,The Wedding Singer,I failed to receive the DVD. Amazon credited my account right away and for this I am grateful. I remain confident that if I use a re-seller through Amazon that I will still be protected. Thanks for that.
5,Rolling with Laughter Funny :))),"Funny, funny romantic comedy!If you remember the 80's this movie makes such great fun of it, making it hilarious. There's even a cameo of Billy Idol.Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler is a great, zany pair. They're a good match here."
2,IT STINKS,"I think your rating system is a bit out of whack! There is no way I would give this movie anything higher than 2 stars!! Email me if you disagree or care to, but please put movie review in the subject line so I don't delete it."
5,Excellent fun and good message,"This movie has become my favorite comedy. It has a great cast, excellent acting, good comedy, a great message about marriage, great soundtrack-- everything is so nice about it! This movie really tackles the idea of marriage and finding the right person. I am sad that this movie wasn't praised as much as it should have. Go see this movie-- I was depressed about love the night I saw it and it really did brighten my spirits! Be prepared to laugh and cry at the end!"
4,Good Movie - Poor Packaging,"The movie is very funny and well deserving of the good recommendations I received from friends. Be advised that the manufacturer has packaged the DVD in a cheap cardboard case. Additionally, the widescreen and fullscreen versions are on opposite sides of the disk! The poor packaging alone should reduce the cost of this disk."
1,Adam Sandler needs help,"I saw this movie and it confirms all my assumptions about Adam Sandler. 1. He is not funny, and he cannot act. 2. He ranks up there with Tim Allen and Jim Carey as one of the least funny comedians of the modern era. 3. He should not be an actor."
4,8mm,"I'm 14 years old and recently saw 8mm. At first, I found it boring and pointless but once Joaquin Phoenix came into it, I was practically hanging off every word. As much as it shocked me because of the violence and butchering, I found that it was a unique and interesting film. Nicholas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix especially, played excellent parts that I don't think anyone else could of matched."
3,Ok,"It's an ok movie, I thought it would be funnier, but it's not a bad movie, just wish I would not have bought it."
2,"Some funny moments,but...","..not my first choice for a romantic comedy. Adam Sandler acts in his movies (that applies to Big Daddy too) as if he's Bruce Lee, who is afraid of no one, and could lift a mountain with one of his fingers. At least that's what appears from his threatening tone when he speaks it (and he does that a lot.)Pros:*Some parts are very funny(like Sandler's version of Madonna's ""Holiday"").Cons:*Those parts aren't that much.*A lot of childish humor,especially near the end.Bottom line:kind of enetertaining,especially the first half,but gets too emotional and childish near the end."
2,"If you like Adam Sandler - okay, but movie drags.","Adam Sandler has some good character pieces in this movie.(as does Drew and other supporting actors) This movie drags out too long. Editing could have cut another quarter of the movie out.(especially piano tutoring scenes) Sorry Adam, you are very very talented, but this wasn't your best."
2,Here's a brief synopsis of the movie,"Real quick review of this movie...15 years ago, there was music, television, and clothes. Today, all those things have changed. Therefore, showing how these things were back then is, today, funny!Yeah, right. Homer Simpson probably put it best when he said ""his clothes are different than my clothes"" as justification for something being funny. But you know what? HOMER SIMPSON IS AN IDIOT.Lame movie"
5,Growing old with you.,"The Wedding Singer starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore is the cutiest, sweetest, and funniest film of the late '90s. Although this film takes place in 1985, this film is refreshing and relevant. The chemistry between the two stars is dynamite! This is one romantic comedy a guy won't be able to turn down, the music, the fashion, the lingo is screams the '80s. I love, love, love this film and so will you. Enjoy!"
3,MAYBE IT WAS GOOD BUT IT WAS NOT A GREAT MOVIE,"ADAM SANDLER AND DREW BARRYMORE ARE A PAIR OF ROMANTIC COUPLE THAT FALLS IN LOVE WHILE PREPARING FOR HER WEDDING. OF COURSE SHE IS GETTING MARRIED TO A JERK THAT THINKS THE SUN RAISES WHEN HE WAKES UP AND SETS WHEN HE GOES TO BED.EVEN THOUGH ADAM WAS ABOUT TO GET MARRIED HIMSELF, HE GETS STOOD UP ON THE ALTAR WHILE HIS FUTURE WIFE WANTS MORE OUT OF LIFE."
4,"Nice one, Adam!","Good movie!!! I guess this is what triggered Adam and Drew's newest movie ""50 First Dates"". You know why? BECAUSE THIS MOVIE WAS SO GOOD! It was pretty good. You just have to see it a few times. The first time I saw it I thought it was OK. Then, after the next few times, it got funnier and funnier! Its overall a pretty good movie. Especially the last 15 minutes when he gets on the plane and meets a famous rock star. (WHO? GET THE MOIVE AND FIND OUT!) So...yeah. Get this movie. You won't regret it."
3,Fun Movie To Watch,"The Wedding Singer is a fun movie to watch even though it's not a classic. The guy who looks like Boy George and sings a Culture Club song is pretty hilarious. Adam Sandler does a good job in his role and so does Drew Barrymore. There are some pretty good songs from the 80s heard throughout the movie. Billy Idol is pretty cool in the movie too. A good representation of the 80s. Not the greatest movie, but still has some funny moments."
1,This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen,I went to see this movie with my friend and her mom and this has got to be the only movie I have ever regretted seeing on big screen. It was a total waste of money (and don't think that just because I'm a teenager and don't remember the eighties that you shouldn't pay attention to my review. The jokes in this movie are always comparing the eighties to the nineties-- for example: one guy starts to wear one white glove and another guy stops him saying it looks wierd-- ha ha). The storyline is way too predictable and this movie is way overrated. There was maybe one funny part in this entire movie and it was funny for about 2 seconds. In short- don't waste your time or money on this movie.
2,"Been there, done that","The Bottom Line:Though perhaps The Wedding Singer deserves points for being less Adam Sandler-y than your standard Adam Sandler movie, it gets all those points deducted for being a stupid, formulaic romantic comedy that skimps on both the romance and the comedy in favor of beyond-cliche sitcom situations and oh-so-tired 80s faux nostalgia: please skip this boring paint-by-numbers film and watch something that will at least offer one surprise.2/4"
1,Adam's worst!,"i hated this movie.i am sorry,but this movie was very boring!very weird and not a good romantic comedy.it wasnt touchin at all.the acting was kind of bad and....god! i hate this movie."
5,"Quick shipping, great price",Thanks you so much! I got the movie fast and it made it super easy plus it was cheaper then most of the places I looked at.
3,Classic Adam Sandler,One of the best movies in the Adam Sandler collection. Even with all the bad hair dos you have to love all the cheesy characters and songs.
2,NOT REALLY FUNNY,"I will make this short. This was another one of those bad comedies that just about everything that was funny, you saw in the commercial. I gave it 2 stars strictly on Jon Lovitz."
5,How could anyone with a soul hate this movie?,"This was a really funny and sweet suprise to me. It wasn't exactly as funny as Happy Gilmore, but it had a better story and it was just a nice movie to viddy. I pretty much fell in love with Drew Barrymore after seeing this movie; she's really, really sweet in this one. Sandler also does a pretty good job at being a nice dude instead of his usual rude guy routine. I think the funniest part in the movie is when Jon Lovitz is like, ""He's losing his mind... and I'm reaping all the benefits..."" and then the curtain closes over his face really slowly and his facial expression just remains evil. HAHA! Doesn't make any sense does it? Yeah, well, the nonsense jokes are usually the funniest ones. If you haven't seen this movie yet, try buying it so you can pat yourself on the back later for having such good judgement."
5,Its hard to admit(not for me)but this movie has GREAT acting,"we have all seen this movie and we know its funny and romantic plus. But think about all that great acting. Like the look in Robbie's eye that tells Julie's friend that he loves Julie was perfect, Deniro couldn't have done it better. or have bout the look in Robbie's eye when he decides to test Glen to see if he cheats. whoever played Glen did a great job. This movie has suck great acting i once watched this show and how much in love they were him with her and her with him on scales of 25%. Great damn movie"
4,"If you grew up in the 80's, you've got to see this movie!",Adam Sandler and Drew Barrimore will take on a hillarious ride through the greatest music and trends of the 80's. A must see.
5,An Absolute Howler,"Adam Sandler is incredibly good (and as of yet underexposed) and would expect this one takes him to the top. Clearly the next major comedian to come through our time ala Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Jim Carrey - he's that good and this movie is that funny. A must own, imho!"
4,Funny,"Very funny movie, one of Sandlers best. There are lots of laughs with the time-period jokes that are thrown in as well."
2,Ok at times but overall it was boring,"This isn't a biography of Led Zeppelin. Its an academic analysis of Led Zeppelins music, fans, even their body postures while they were performing. There were parts of the book that I found interesting but most of it left me bored and uninterested. I'm a huge fan of Led Zeppelin and if I was lukewarm to this I can't imagine a casual fan being into this."
2,Misses the point,"This is an unfortunate example of an academic trying very hard to understand with her mind what she obviously does not with her heart. To her credit, she tries very, very hard.I can only imagine one of the band members endeavoring to read this intellectual over-analysis and gasping for breath in between bursts of laughter. It reads like a parody of itself, and it sure cracked me up."
2,"Not a book for someone looking how to ""do"" genealogy.","For a book on such an important subject with regards to genealogy, I was a little disappointed. While there are ample examples throughout book, this book is out-of-date for today's genealogist. No mention of electronic sources and how to document. Save your money and buy ""Evidence: Citation and Analysis for the Family Historian"" by Elizabeth Shown Mills. Ms. Mills refers to Lackey's book countless times and gives better examples."
2,Now Obsolete. Mills' Evidence!... is the latest.,"This was THE authority on the subject, however Elizabeth Shown Mills' book Evidence! Citation and Analysis for the Family Historian is better."
1,Worst speaker if you can even call it that!,"I didn't get the speaker I bought. The one that was shipped says 700 watts. The rubber surround is barley visibly!! In the picture it is huge! What false advertising! I should post pictures to show you ...I hooked it up, replacing my stock Velodyne sub. I turned the MTX amp on and thought a wire was not on or something... then I realized that it was 'working' but there was hardly any air moving. I turned off the mids and highs so I could hear just the sub. It sounded like a sub without any low end. What a nasty joke on me! Yeah it is cheap, but I thought it would at least work a little bit. Other than a stage prop, it is worthless!!!"
4,Paul's side project is one to be reckoned with.,"It's shame that fans of Enchant don't know about this album because it's one heck of a disc. Recorded at the same time as Enchant's ""Break,"" this album shows the guys from Enchant stretching out a little. Tracks like ""She Plays,"" ""Red Letter Day"" and ""Middle Ground"" are tracks that could be on ""Break"" pretty easily and some of the other tracks - ""Prettyznenuf, ""Birthright"" and ""Existentialist"" - shows Paul branching out musically as well as lyrically (check out the very introspective lyrics on ""Existentialist""). For Enchant fans, this is a MUST have."
3,Average at best,"Yes, you get it for free and it has the H&R Block name behind it. But don't get fooled and expect too much. If you want to go back and add/edit entries to the tax return in progress, you can't be sure that the software will re-calculate everything. Alteast it allows manual entries, which is how I finalized my return. The software also has several disclaimers (on Schedules A & D) that they are not finalized. I will probably do a manual check of the numbers. I would go with TurboTax, which I used last year and was much better than this."
1,Taxcut Quality has taken a nosedive.,"I have used Taxcut at least 6 years now. I used Turbo Tax Deluxe once between tax years and returned back to Taxcut because it was a better price. This year I was ripped off. I should have gone with Turbo Tax. Not only did the software crash on XP, but it crashed at the end of my ""Interview"" of entering in all my information. Locked up every time I got to this point. There were also a few points along the way where data was lost for charitable contributions and a couple of other worksheets. In all I think I had at least 4 quirks to work around in the software. I did eventually figure out the lockup problem and got my taxes finished. Then after downloading the CA State and e-filing I spent another $45. I could have paid a tax guy to just do all my taxes in the long run. Taxcut will never get my business again. I am going to Turbotax next year."
1,Only good thing was the price,Found it difficut to follow and the first time through some entries were not correct and on the wrong lines. After going back several times and very carefully checking the return is correct I hope. It would have been much easier to have made the entries on the 1040 Forms.
1,"COOL Motorcycle---16 Tests To Pass, BEFORE You Can Play Game","ARGHHHHHH! After You Pass The ""Skills"" Tests from the ""Storyline"" , You CAN'T ACTUALLY Begin the game until you pass 16 ""Leila"" (name of HQ) Tests, to get your bounty hunters' license back!~~ NO REAL Gameplay until you Complete ALL 16 ""Leila"" License Test!!!!!! So, i just ride around town on the motorcycle. You can feel the leans on the bike, but GOD forbid you HiT something! You CAN'T back-up, OR Turn Around, or get off the bike! ~` Again, ** ARGHHHHHHHHHHH!! I paid $8.95 for this game, and THAT was TOOOOO much! :0("
4,VERY UNDERRATED!,"I actually liked this game! I considered this game one of the most underrated games ever. The physics and action play is quite good and the abundance of play is worth the buy. If you like to do a little fighting with a little puzzlin' to solve than this is a good game you might have not heard of. I like how you can ride a motorcycle around the town from place to place but you can't do it at will which really stinks but hopefully they will allow that in the sequel! Well, there is alot of things I like about this game but to put it in short, very good graphics, very good play, very good story = VERY GOOD GAME"
5,A Buried Treasure,"I've played this game on PS2, and now own it. Originally on Dreamcast, this game is bound to be and is compared to Metal Gear Solid. I feel that it should not, for it is very different from that game. One of the coolest things about this game is how when you go somewhere, you go there. You're not just suddenly there, you hop on your cool motorcycle and ride throughout the town to get there. The game takes place in the future and the developers really built up a solid, futuristic world. The story is intriguing, and the gameplay combines stealth with shootouts. Put that with a killer gamesoundtrack, and you have yourself a buried treasure. The only two things that could have been fixed in this game are the animations when you hit a car on your bike and some camera issues."
3,A Rental,"Head Hunters is one of those games that is not worth buying. It may have a lot of action but in the end it is simply a puzzle game. The whole game fits together way to easily. One thing leads to the next and to the next until the game is over. Action is just thrown in to keep the game from getting boring. Game play is pretty much a bad Metal gear Solid Game. You can roll push up against walls and snap people's necks from behind. The only useful feature in the game is rolling since it is a great way to doge bullets, and most of the time you'll be fired on by enemies off the screen, so rolling to cover can be a life saver. The game also has terrible camera angels, and at times your character will be hidden behind walls while enemies are beating the sh** out of him. The worst part is once you beat the game you wont want to play it again it has no replay value. This game is a rental and is not worth buying."
3,HeadHunter: A bit too much like MGS2:SoL,"HeadHunter's storyline is quite original, although hard to follow at points. The character portrayal is solid, as are the controls. But be warned: This game is like a cross between Metal Gear Solid 2 (stealth aspect + radar + VR missions), Winback (stick to wall corner shot + pistol has infinite ammo), and Resident Evil (item and menu system). But even with all the rip-offs, its story makes up for a good game.This game also has a lot of CG sequences, a quality not found in too many shooters these days. The length is a solid 10+ hours, and makes for a good rental. Recommended for 3rd Person shooter fans who don't mind a little bit of stealth neck-breakin'. Not recommended for die hard MGS2 fans (you'll think it's the world's biggest rip-off). But still, it's a whole heck of a lot better than Winback!!"
1,Difference between Dreamcast version?,"They should of waited for the sequel. The nearly identical game was out months ago for Dreamcast. It's no Max Payne, that's for sure."
3,"Its not Metal Gear Solid 2, but its close!","Headhunter really isnt such a bad game. It has its ups, and it has it downs. The only good thing is riding a super-bike around town(the town and its surroundings are cheaply designed though).Overall, Headhunter is not worth the [money]. ..."
5,headhunter,the best game i ever played that makes you think about every thing you touch look at and do
2,Disappointment,"This game will seem to be the worst ever for all those who enjoyed Metal Gear Solid and maybe the Syphon Filter series. It pretends to be a stealth game; but it is certainly not. Besides , there are huge control and camera issues. Don't buy it, just rent it so can realize by yourselves how bad the gameplay is."
2,not that good,"headhunter is a very challenging game and not very fun, it is a waste of money, don't buy it!"
2,Not so much....,"I need to keep my neck aligned with my spine, this pillow seemed perfect.. But... It's really too thick if that is your goal. It's a very fat, fluffy pillow. Darn."
2,Just a so-so cervical pillow.,"Neck is still hurting. Found that the pillow really did not do what I hoped it would. It seems as though it didn't really support my neck the wayI thought it would. Very disappointed. Unfortunately, I threw away the box and shipping materials, otherwise I would have returned the pillow. A waste of money. I'm glad it wasn't an expensive item."
4,My 8-Year-Old Nephew Loves It,"When I asked my nephew what he wanted for Christmas, he replied, ""A funny mask."" Well, that's what this is. He tried it after opening it, and it really was funny-looking. We all had a laugh, then passed it around so that everyone could get their picture taken with it on. Guess it really depends on the kid or the family, but he was happy with it."
2,Club Music Fans Rejoice. Oldfield Fans Ignore.,"I wanted to like this single. I really did. I though the CD Single for ""Let Their Be Light"" has some really nice, dancable stuff on it that still had that Oldfield flare. I wish I could say the same of Far Above the Clouds Part One.As far as club/dance music goes, the first two tracks (the remixes) are pretty good. Not spectacular, but pretty good. The third is ""Far Above the Clouds"" as it appears on the Tubular Bells III album, so if you already own TBIII (if not, then get it!) there's nothing new in it.I think it's great that Warner is putting some marketing weight behind Oldfield. I hope they continue to do so. I just hope that their efforts will result in something that both old and new Oldfield fans can enjoy. This particular single isn't it."
4,"A lighter, danceable recording","Having more familiarity with the classical instrumental music of Afghanistan performed by soloists, I must reply on comparison with the successful CD, Radio Kabul, for large ensemble music. That recording is some 20 minutes longer and encompasses a variety of musical forms, both darker and more subdued classical instrumentas and joyous popular songs, and the musicianship is very fine. In this CD, Zohreh Jooya's voice is remarkably smooth and lovely, and Hamid Golestani's excellent baritone is a nice contrast in the series of tracks. The overall recording of songs, including ghazals and qawwalis, is light and spirited and more uniform in tone. It is happy and sometimes danceable. There is perhaps too much harmonium, but the rubab and various drums support the ensemble well. My actual rating is 4.5 stars."
5,Very good CD,"I am the president of the ""Association of Culture of Afghanistan in Austria"". The music comprises traditional Afghan songs played artistically on the robab, harmonia, damburrah and tabla which are the main instruments of my country. The smooth voice and European singing education of Mrs. Jooya sets a new mile stone in Afghan traditional music. In particular the duets with Hamid Golestani are a wonderful match of two so diverse voices. Mrs Jooya has many fans among Afghan who live outside and inside Afghanistan. We appreciate the art of Mrs. Zohreh Jooya very much and are very proud to have such a renowned representative of Afghan culture living in Austria. For us she is like an ambassador of Afghan art who shows the other side of Afghanistan. She shows that Afghanistan is an old country with a high culture and not just a place of warlords and drug traffic how it is perceived from all the reports in the media.Gousudden Mir"
3,Undecided,After 1 month of what appeared to be flawless use. The pump quit. Still planning to return to the manufacturer for a new one. Did come with a decent guarentee.
5,FABULOUS!!!,I love this organizer - It has all the room for everything I need and I have gotten lots of compliments on it as well. Buy with confidence - this vendor is great as well
4,Good inexpensive gloves,"Update 02/12/12:I'll admit I do not do a lot of lifting in each of my workouts, but the stitching on these have held up for such an old pair! I hand wash them with dish soap which may explain their longevity.They get the job done. I ordered them as filler to get free shipping on some iPod earphones I ordered for the gym. They've held up well and seem to have good stitching. Adjustable velcro works well for a snug fit. Not the perfect gloves but very good for the $"
2,did not care for this album,jusyt did not like it.l Thought it would be begtter. I would not advise buying it unless looking for something very different
1,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I ORDERED THIS ITEM IN JANUARY BUT UNTIL TODAY, I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY ORDER. THEY OFFERED TO REFUND MY MONEY OR RE-SEND IT, AND I OPTED FOR THE SECOND OFFER. AMANDA TOLD ME THAT THIS ITEM WAS OUT OF STOCK SO THEY WOULD JUST REFUND MY MONEY, OR IF THE ITEM WOULD RETURN TO THEM, THEY WOULD RE-SHIP IT. I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY FURTHER INFO AFTER THAT E-MAIL EVEN WITH MY CONSTANT FOLLOW UPS, UNTIL ONE DAY, MY HUSBAND TOLD ME THAT WE'LL BE TRANSFERRED TO A DIFFERENT COUNTRY. SINCE WE ARE LEAVING THIS COUNTRY NEXT MONTH, I STARTED CONTACTING THEM IN MAY TO JUST REFUND MY MONEY BUT NOBODY HAS REPLIED TO ME UP TO THIS DAY. PLEASE GIVE MY MONEY BACK AND HAVE THE DECENCY TO REPLY TO YOUR CUSTOMERS!"
2,Buy the 10th Edition. This is the 4th Edition.,"When buying this, I didn't realize that it was the 4th edition. The 10th edition is actually available at Amazon under this ISBN: 0-87830-153-4 . Anyone interested in ballroom dancing should really be buying the most recent edition."
1,Most useless book,"If you listen to the Batras, you would have missed one of the strongest stockmarket rise in US history. Needless to say you will be much poorer - if not ending in the poorhouse.There is a long list of Doomsday book written by the Batras. Fortunately for me (except that I wasted my money buying his book) I read a few pages of one of his book in the eighties and threw it into the dustbin (at Seatac airport - hopefully no one picks it up to read his nonsense). Then I was wondering how a guy like Ravi Batra could be teaching in a University. I am truly amazed what kind of students he churns out."
2,Ravi got it wrong again!,"I first read Ravi's book ""The Great Depression of 1990"" in 1988 and was worried that Ravi's prediction will come true. The result is that I missed the most stunning bull run in the financial market. This time Ravi, Ravi again predicted some doom and gloom picture, which we all know now that the crash never materalise in 1999.Ravi keep saying about his prediction record, but the funny thing is that for the two books that I read by him, both predictions made in the book are wrong.... so much about track record.In this book, Ravi, as usual, try to look through the past history on inflation, unemployment, past depression etc. to predict what will happen. However, little, as far as I could remember, of what the changes in the New economy was mentioned.My advice to the readers? Save your money and put it into mutual funds instead."
1,The Great Depression of 1990 revisited,Batra wrote a book entitled The Great Depression of 1990. Now he's back with predictions of further economic cataclysms.
4,"Even if he's wrong, he's right",Most will agree that stock share prices are primarily these days fueled by speculation and on-line trading by average Americans. Also most will agree that ordinary prices for goods and services are increasing steadily. And let's acknowledge that some problems are expected as the Y2K bug materializes. Prof. Batra gives sound reasons based on history why these scenarios will play to our detrement. Well worth the purchase price.
3,Don't Listen Too Closely to the Advice,"Looking at Batra's reveiw of his own predictions and comparing them to my own version of reality, I would say he has been pretty accurate in much of what he said previously. BUT, and it's an important but, they have tended not to happen precisely when he says or with the severity he has predicted. His idea that significant events occur in the last year of each decade must be plain crazy: he says for example 1929 sowed the seeds of disaster because it was the start of the depression - wrong! The seeds were sown in 1927/8. You could just as easily claim that each year ending in 4, 5, 6 or any other decimal number was significant!That said, there is certainly truth in some part of what he says - America is way overborrowed, and that could portend of a crash."
5,Great resource,"If you take your writing seriously, you probably want to get it out into the world: to sell books, to connect with readers. Succeeding at that task means that you need to understand the marketing channels you're dealing with and not take *yourself* too seriously. George Arnold is a great ally in that process. With a sense of humor and a lot of energy, he shares information about book marketing (to a publisher, to retailers, to readers) that he learned the hard way. It could take you years (it has taken me years) to figure this stuff out. This book is worth the price even if you only read one chapter. You get fourteen chapters, plus a great epilogue and an amusing glossary--invaluable stuff that isn't in print elsewhere, including charts to keep yourself organized while you follow through. Not only that, Arnold believes the whole endeavor should be fun, and his techniques show how it can be."
2,Poor Quality - Good Show,"Season 3 Parts 1 and 2 are good shows, but the quality on these DVDs is poor. No disc menu exists. There are no extra features. Basically, someone dumped all the shows on a dvd and called it good. You can't take the DVD out of your player or you will have to start from the beginning and ""forward"" through all the shows to get where you left off or to find your favorite episode. My family loves this show, but the disc quality for Season 3 is not worth $30 for each part. This was very disappointing."
3,"Not bad, not fantastic","This is a fairly good book if you have got quite far with learning the clarinet. It has some well known tunes but some that younger people will not know. The piano accompaniment is very good and it is well arranged. There is a lot of variety in the pieces to suit different moods but it is quite easy to become bored with it, especially if you don't have anyone to play the accompaniment."
2,Split personality,"The first half of the book regarding a mother's anguish over her son's disappearance was poignant and beautifully written. By the time I finished the book, I thought another writer had taken over mid-point and changed the focus of the novel. The ending was much more mystical/science fictiony/religious than I had expected when I picked up the book. All in all, the book was well-written but too farfetched at the end for my liking."
3,This book was a rather sneaky one...,"The beginning sucks readers in with an exciting story of a missing boy. The mystery and high emotions were well-written and riveting. But once the focus shifted... or, rather, once the author had his audience fully hooked, he climbed onto his Save-The-World soapbox and the story suffered for it. Other books have tackled this ecology theme to a much more effective level. All in all, with such a promising start, I was disappointed. Plus the Hermit's mystery was never fully resolved..."
1,bizarre at best,"The book started out very entertaining. I thought it was going to be a great mystery/thriller. However, I was quickly disappointed as the context was too bizarre to swallow even for a non-fiction book. Skip it!"
5,fast and tasty,"I first found this product when I lived in Hawaii 20 years ago. While I can make a stir fry sauce from scratch this product is not only fast but delicious. I purchase the already pre-cut broccolli, cauliflower and carrot mix at the local grocery store. Then I only need to cut up two large chicken breasts and cook it all up. I can create this dish in under 20 minutes and it is better than what they offer at the local take out establishment."
5,Apollo 13,Lovell & Krantz were keynote speakers at a convention. After hearing them speak I HAD to see Apollo 13 again. Got a copy for a friend. They arrived quickly and were perfect DVD's. would do it again.
1,Don't bother,"If you own this movie as I do (the 2 disc anniversary edition w/Imax version).This is about the finest looking standard dvd there is,the transfer to blu-ray is poor,not a poor picture,thou colors are a little off in spots,but it is not a step up.The audio seems to have suffered in the bass department.So if you own the movie already,don't waste the money."
4,Missing scenes!!,"I love, love, love this movie - so much, that I may know it by heart - that is why I noticed that at least 2 scenes have either been cut or shortened? I'm referring to the 2-disc anniversary edition, IMAX Experience version - why have 2 discs and cut scenes from the movie? One missing scene was when the NASA men enterred Gary Sinese's apartment and woke him up to take him back to Mission Control and the other scene was at re-entry, when Tom Hanks realized he was sitting in Kevin Bacon's seat, and acknowledged so. - Didn't anyone else notice these were no longer in the movie? Perhaps even more scenes were skipped?"
5,HD-DVD Apollo 13-the version to own,"If you don't own an HD-DVD player stop now. Yes the format is dead-and NO I am not sorry one whit I bought one. That aside, this movie is reviewed in detail elsewhere, so I'm just dealing with the HD-DVD version and how it stacks up against the other formats. I've owned the regular DVD and the laserdisc version of this movie- and this one is SOOO much better. Crystal clear picture with remarkable detail. The space sequences are breathtaking in beauty. The launch sequence is a great demo- though not as aggressive on the subwoofer as I'd expected or hoped for. Well worth the bargain price now that the format war is over. As an aside- if you need a new dvd player consider an HD-DVD player. They're on sale and GREAT upconverters for regular DVD's- and as a bonus, play true HD-DVD movies. I expect getting years of enjoyment from mine."
2,Technical DVD review ONLY.,"Do not be fooled by the tag, ""IMAX theatrical experience"". This is the original theatrical release version of the movie. Which was very fine, because it's a very fine movie. But I haven't seen the original theatrical version since I saw it at the movies the first time! Since then, I've been watching the special extended cut on VHS. Finally updating to ""anniversary edition"" DVD, I was MUCHO DISAPPOINTED to find all my favorite extra scenes cut!The extras ARE worth having, so it wasn't a total mis-buy, but now I will have to find a DVD version of the extended cut, too, so I can have the complete movie that I love in my collection."
5,Great video and sound effect! Also the greatest story!,"This movie is attracting me for a long time ago, I brought the LD for DTS version, DVD for Dolby Digital AC-3 version. Finally, The dts DVD launch! It's truly worth you to buy it! The true story and greatest actors make this movie more realist!If you do have dts theater audio equipment, you never miss this movie in your collection list!"
1,One of the worst Blu Ray transfers extant!,"This is awful....grainy, full of artifacts. Absolutely no effort was put into this disaster.Minus 1 million stars! I think it is in many ways worse than the DVD.This is not worth considering on blu ray."
5,High Drama,"Everything about this movie is five-star, the direction, the cast, the story, all working together to produce the recreation of real-life high drama!All the pieces of the story are tightly woven together to tell a riveting tale that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat and takes them on an emotional roller coaster.This is a story that had to be retold, and a movie that had to be made!"
5,Almost tragedy turned into Great American Cinema.,"Love this movie, would recommend it to anyone who would like to be grossly entertained for 220 minutes. Both acting and direction are great. My favorite Ron Howard movie. Gary Sinise and Ed Harris shine."
4,Not as Great as is Should have been but it`s a fine film.,"When Three Men (Two-Time Oscar-Winner:Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton), who have been training to go in Space and Walk on the Moon. but it`s turns to be a Intense Journey, when they come close to Death. They have to find another way to get back to Earth and Going Back Home.Directed by Oscar-Winner:Ron Howard (Williow, Far and Away, A Beautiful Mind) has made a well made film, which is Based on a True Story. Fine Performances by Hanks, Bacon, Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris(In a Oscar Nominated Role), and Kathleen Quinlan (In a Oscar Nominated Role). Director:Howard gives his Brother-Clint Howard a Small Memorable Role. Great Visual Effects by Digital Domain. Re-Release and Re-Edited for IMAX. Super 35. Grade:B+."
5,A rescue with suspense beyond the scope of an imaginative plot!,"So many reviews have already been written, critiquing the details. I, therefore, would just like categorize this as a great movie that triumphs the imagination, inventiveness, and creative ability of the human person. In such a time-critical situation with such limited resources at best, separated by hundreds of thousands of miles of empty space, the engineers of NASA pulled off a rescue mission with such real suspense that it was beyond the scope of an imaginative plot. Looking back at the reality of this historical event, it shines as one of our country's ""finest hours.""The great acting and directing put us right there in the middle of the drama."
5,Apollo 13,"Great movie even for a science class. The language is a little rough for the younger generations, but the movie is very accurate and educational."
5,Great movie,"Blu-ray version is very good!! Always a good movie to have in the collection and while you might watch the movie in other settings, on a sufficiently large home screen BR is the way to go."
3,HDVD version vs. Blu ray,"In my opinion, it would be EXTREMELY helpful if Amazon would NOT throw ALL of the reviews for any given product into one bucket.In this case, the review would be for the (defunct) HDDVD version of Apollo 13. This version is NOT the Blu ray version (3 of them in Blu ray), The Blu ray version has moderate to terrible graining in various portions of the movie. This HDDVD version needs to be segregated from those Blu ray & regular dvd versions so one can get an accurate appraisal of THIS movie without having to weed thru all of the other reviews that do not pertain to THIS selection. I would like to see an accurate opinion on THIS dvd so I can make an informed decision as whether to purchase it."
5,"One of my favourite movies, top 100","I love this movie because it is of great didactic utility on the subject of Crisis Management. It is also a source of inspiration for me. The fact that we see people flying all the way to the moon in the context of a historical, instead of a fictional, event, makes me like this movie even more. Recommended!"
4,Not an improvement over the original release.,"While this is ""all new digitally remastered"" I think most film buffs will find the picture quality a disappointment. The major change is an unnatural increase in color saturation; you could get the same effect (if you wanted to) with a minor adjustment to your TV. There do not appear to be any other ""improvements."" Certainly the picture does not resemble what was seen in theaters. I find it distracting and unpleasant to look at.Don't buy this release as a replacement for the older disk - In fact, you may want to specifically look for the older disk if you don't have it."
4,"IT'S KINDA OF BORING, BUT IT'S EXCELLENT!","I love this movie, but it's kinda of boring, but with DTS, there's more excictment."
3,Like Watching Paint Dry,"I could not fault the acting, special effects or indeed any of the technical aspects of this film. However I can't help feeling that whilst virtually any occurance in history has lead to a movie - perhaps this one should have been left to the 'made for tv' genre. The way I see it, certain historic events - regardless of importance - just do not translate well into film. I have Apollo 13 on my shelf, yet I can't bring myself to wade through the tedious 'hurry up and wait' plot again. It reminds me of 'Contact (Jodie Foster)' - you are not kept on the edge of your seat, rather the film seems to spend too much time lulling one into a sense of security, and too little time recovering from the next drawback."
3,Keep It Honest !,"Good movie of a great human adventure,well acted and professionally filmed.Looks a bit stiff and un-imaginative in the developpement of the ""story"" but overall a very fine visualisation of this tragic-heroic piece of American history."
4,The greatest triumphant failure in history? Close.,"After reading the book, (all true fans should, by the way) this movie, as most do, seems to slide into the slightly thin side. In fact, the movie-makers didn't have time or space to detail all that befell the flight, spending time instead on scene-setting and character-building.A shame, for what you have here is a professionally-done retelling of a tale which too many of us don't know. The events of the film sum up much that was good and bad about American attitudes towards the Space Race, and usually manages to steer clear of jingoism. Wonderful, wonderful music from James Horner supplements a solid cast, of whom Ed Harris gets most praise for his portrayal of Gene Kranz, a flight director who just won't give up. Not the real thing, then, but an incredible simulation."
1,Whaaaaat???,"All the below being true, I believe I'll just stick with my clunky old Apollo DVD until I hear that those high-placed studio clowns have reattached their heads in the right direction."
3,Not too much action/suspense,I wanted them to make it on the moon not have to worry about getting back to earth somehow. I felt it was boring and predictable. It needed more action like Armagedon or Star Wars. This movie was too realistic which made it all the more boring.
1,Apollo 13 DVD-HD,Product did not work. Amazon sent 2nd DVD and it did not work.I had to use a 1 star for the review to go through. You should have a zero for did not work.
2,ENOUGH ALREADY!,"ROCKY V may have tanked at the box-office, but that didn't stop Sylvester Stallone from reviving the Apollo Creed character from the original film and spinning him off into his own franchise. By the time this THIRTEENTH installment was released, the series had run out of gas. The film is probably best remembered for it's tagline, ""Yo, Houston! It's me, Rocky..."""
1,Just amfull,"All the special effects aside, this film is not really that good. THe film is nothing more than a john wayne film with lots of gloss and realism. Tom hanks is not really that good of an actor and this simplistic role proves it ,"
1,",max elliott slade looked stupid in it",you could have made him look like the cute little button he is
4,"Great movie, OK DVD","Apollo 13 the movie is definitly my favorite movie of all time. The DVD disk has some nice features such as a commentary on the movie by Jim Lovell and an hour long documentary on the production of Apollo 13.However, I was a bit disappointed with the A/V quality of the DVD. While it's definitly acceptable, it's not spectacular. It is in widescreen format, which is ok except that the top and bottom border is fuzzy sometimes. The sound is good, but doesn't compare to the ""Apollo 13"" audio CD in terms of sound quality. (though I do have the 14K gold version of the audio soundtrack, which does make a big difference.) END"
2,WHY THE MISSING SCENES???,"Being a big follower of the space program since the mid-1960s, I was really excited when Apollo 13 was released..first on VHS, then to DVD. But on both the DVD-released versions, why are there scenes missing? One that I noticed right away is when Barbara Lovell(the Lovell's eldest daughter) doesn't want to go to Mission Control to watch the TV broadcast from space. Presumably because she is upset over the Beatle's breakup. Then much of the TV broadcast itself from the VHS version is missing. There were more missing, as well. It was a little disconcerting..especially with the ""anniversary"" edition. But the essence of the story..the triumph of the human spirit in the face of extraordinary odds...still remains true."
5,100 stars performance,One of the best movies of all times. All the actors/actresses were sooooooo WONDERFUL!!! I saw it over and over again. (no kidding) =-D
3,downgrade over the HD-DVD,"Great movie first.While this does get lossless audio and a higher bitrate than the HD-DVD, the amount of noise reduction has reduced the overall detail. If you have the HD-DVD, keep it."
2,"One small step for Ron, one overrated film for mankind","Apollo 13 has been so overpraised as a film even the evil Newt Gingrich would like it's hard to buck the trend, but here goes: As one of the Apollo moon mission junkies I saw this one on its release and was disappointed. Instead of the profound experience I expected of man going to the moon I got some jokes about the constellation Urine, some lines like, ""Mommy, you're squishing me"", and family scenes so schmaltzy they are practically unwatchable.The film should be considered well done except for these family scenes which dumb it down so much.To me the Apollo missions are mankind's greatest achievement and this film cheapens the experience. I hope man one day returns to the moon and onto Mars instead of spending trillions of dollars on war. I recommend an excellent, but hard to get documentary on Apollo 11 called, ""Moonwalk One"" that's shown sometimes on NASA TV."
5,Great History Movie,A great portrayl of events that happened and how man was able to solve problems never before envountered. Fasilure was not an option. Additional features on DVD ase enlightning.
1,Unable to load,The DVD came in great condition. New in wrapper but we were unable to load on any of our DVD players.
5,Excellent HD Picture quality-Great Movie!,"I owned this movie in full screen on VHS. The quality of the transfer of ""Apollo 13"" with the wide screen and the incredible clarity 0f HD that was never possible before, makes this movie a true cinematic experience. One of Tom Hanks' best movies!Since we're revewing here the HD version, I own a new Samsung 61"" HDTV and the Toshiba HD-A1 ($399 from Amazon). An incredible improvement over my 1998 60"" Standard Sony TV. If you have the right setup, it is the true home theater dream that we all hoped for since the dawn of home video back in the late 70's or early 80's. Be sure you use the HDMI cable or at least component connection.The audio track is also Great! With the right Dolby Digital/Plus 5.1 receiver/Speaker/Placement.Also, lots of Extras on the NTSC US version, including interviews with Hanks and some of the real astronauts."
3,"Great movie, disappointing DTS DVD","This is one of my favorite films. Had it on VHS pan and scan, then VHS widescreen, now DVD DTS version. I was really excited to try this out on the DVD player. It's a good transfer with excellent sound.But, for some reason, they left out ALL of the extra goodies on the DTS version of this disk! No subtitles, no trailers, NOTHING! What were they thinking? I really wanted to see that extra stuff! According to the other reviews posted here, the extra material was excellent on the other version of this disk. Shame on these guys for ripping us off on the DTS version.Will swap my DTS for a non-DTS version! Interested? Write me: JonADuncan@aol.com."
1,Bait and switch...movie does not work.,"Just like the other reviews...this Blu-ray disk takes forever to get to the ""play movie"" menu only to get caught in a loop and never playing the movie. I do not have an internet connection to my Blu-ray player. Why should I? I was purchasing a movie...not a social networking package! How do I get my money back?"
5,behind the headlines,"I was at UCLA when this happened. I remember watching the news reports like everyone else on the planet. But to find out what was going on at Houston behind the scenes, what they didn't talk about to the press, it really adds to my memories of that time."
1,Brave new world of DVDs,"I strongly concur... this is the WORST disk interface ever. I tried loading and navigating the menus that finally pop up. Hitting ""Play"" does something really annoying: first, the ""menu"" disappears, but the typical loop of background video continues for 4 minutes. Then, the screen goes completely dark for at least 4 more minutes. There is no indication of ""loading the movie"" or ""please wait"" or any feedback that one is NOT wasting one's time. Okay, by now, the screen's been dark for 6 minutes. Dear Amazon: don't YOU have a role to play here? My blu-ray player is only 1 year old and there is not indication of a compatibiilty issue. I admit... my tv is NOT connected to the internet, but so what? Since when does it have to be? Now 13 minutes after I hit ""play"".... still nothing. What a rip"
3,"Watch ""From the Earth to the Moon"" instead","This is a long movie, and it certainly seems like it. Perhaps its Tom Hank's typically low-energy acting, or just that the movie doesn't recreate the suspense over 30 years after the incident, but I just find it heard to sit through this movie. At times, it starts to seem like the Tom Hanks show.If there is any redeeming factor to the movie, it's the fact that it later led to Tom Hank'sFrom the Earth to the Moontelevision series, which is excellent. That series focuses on the entire Apollo program and has a great set of actors [the series includes an episode on Apollo 13, but it also isn't very good]. I would actually giveApollo 13an extra star just for leading to that series. On its own, the movie just isn't very satisfying."
5,Fantastic color,"Blu-ray was awesome. Sharp,crisp colors. There wasn't any skipping like you get sometimes from a digital copy. I highly recommend the blu-ray copy."
5,One of My All Time Top 10 Movies!,"Rod Howard's best film by far. This film is brillant from start to finish. It should have won Oscars for Best Picture and for Best Director (""Braveheart"" and Mel Gibson ... Really!?!). Even with the wonderful acting, directing and cinematography - the best parts of ""Apollo 13"" deal with the creativity and daring that NASA had in the earlier days of our space program. All this is made better now with a Blu-Ray, DVD and digital copy ... so I can now watch it on my iPhone or iPad anytime, anywhere ... again and again! Love it!"
2,Apollo 13 the unseen film for me!,"I don""t see the film yet, because it doesn""t arrived to me! What is happening? Can you tell me? International mail is working unproperly?"
4,Apollo 13 - Blu Ray,"Great film, certainly, one of my favorite movies, great director, one of the most amazing casts ever assembled in one film, the quality of this blu ray is surely a big improvement over the standard DVD, but having said that, I think there's still room for improvements and I was hoping that Universal would have given this film a better treatment. I saw this movie in the theatre, on DVD, this blu ray is the best looking Apollo 13 I've seen, it simply did not ""WOW"" me like ""Braveheart"" did."
1,Apollo 13,Item arrived with NO DVD. I needed this to teach a college course and I had to pay for premium shipping for the replacement DVD which is not HD. Very disappointed in the deal.
3,It's ok...,The movie was not what I expected... actually it was. It was mundane and a little slow... though the plot was good
3,To the moon and... crap!,"I didn't really download or watch the movie from Amazon, I've seen this before.Someone gave me a free link to get a copy of it here, so I used it just to see how the process worked here at Amazon.As for the movie, it's a good one if you like claustrophbic situations in sub-zero environments while traveling thousands of miles an hour..."
5,GREAT MOVIE vary real,THis movie depicts apallo 13 vary well it gives lots of detail about what happend One of tom hanks etter movies worth the money
1,Not Worth The Trouble,"I purchased this movie expecting a Blu Ray spectacular since this movie was originally released as a defunked HD-DVD, I thought they would make it even better because of that. I have a Panasonic player with the latest firmware updates and was totally annoyed with the amount of time it took to load. Even after I had selected PLAY MOVIE, I was subjected to even more delays. I'm glad my player is not connected to the internet like many others with complaints about all the extranious junk heaped upon them. If you own the original verson, the up conversion on your Blu Ray player will make the difference in video quality negligible and save you 17 bucks and all the loading problems. Universal. If this junk is an example of your future Blu Ray releases, don't bother."
1,It was very bad and it put me to sleep,This movie was poor from start to finish. I found the plot to be lacking. I would have rather watched Driving Miss Daisy. This movie caused me a great deal of mental problems.
4,Movie making at its best,"It's a long way from Happy Days to the space race but Ron Howard has done a fantastic job of bringing the Apollo 13 story to the big screen. I loved the special effects, loved the acting, loved the suspense and was inspired by the music score much as I inspired by those original events I still vividly recall as a nine year old Australian school boy. My favourite scene: the Apollo 13 launch from the nervous moments in the Astronauts' fit-out rooms to insertion in earth orbit. Somehow Howard created a crescendo of drama that wasn't eased until we see scenes of Astronauts' gloves floating in zero gravity. Another feature is the excellent recreation of Mission Control in Houston. The supporting cast were fantastic. Each were quirky individuals in their own right, not clone-like extras there to make up the numbers. I liked Happy Days, Ron, but I loved Apollo 13 even more. Movie making at its best."
2,Horrible Blu-Ray,"I can't believe nobody at Universal realized that this Blu-Ray has so many problems. First, it takes forever to load, at which point it tries to download a ""fresh preview"" (e.g., trailer) from the Internet. Once you get around that, it takes several minutes for it to load the main menu, simply presenting a Universal logo spinner. After that, you get a main menu that simply will not operate. Sadly, the behavior is the same on both of my Blu-Ray players: LG and Panasonic. The only Blu-Ray player that I've seen this work correctly on is a Playstation 3. Did Universal even bother to test this on anything else? What a RIP OFF this disc is...."
5,Classic Tom Hanks Drama. Great.,"I was reluctant to see this movie because it was ""so predictable."" I thought it was reminiscent of Titanic (which was not good, in my opinion) and did not see it until it came out on video. I loved it. Tom Hanks did a phenomenal job acting, and the movie is well written and well scored. Ron Howard's commentary on the DVD is great as well as the Lovell's. A must buy."
5,Excellent DVD with wonderful extras.,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The DVD transfer is great. There is an extensive and fascinating documentary with Ron Howard, Hanks, other actors and producers, even Jim and Marilyn Lovell! Oh, and don't forget to look for the ""easter egg"" (a.k.a. ""hidden feature"") on the disc. When you go to the menu, the soundtrack of the movie will start and play each song, even the ""unreleased"" tracks that you can't buy in the store! At first I thought that the menu would just play the main title theme over and over but if you keep listening, it goes from one track to the next. Just hit the skip button on your DVD player. Awesome movie."
5,Perfect gift,"It is my father's favorite movie, thus his favorite Christmas gift. It is a great movie, and does make a nice gift for that generation who lived during the event."
5,"Great, Great, Great, Great!!!","Edge-of-your-seat-for-the-whole-two-hours type movie. Awesome, awesome, awesome. Just watch it. Now."
2,Playing it safe,"2 1/2Try as he might to escape generic entrapments present within stale blues-rock guitar virtuoso songwriting, even most bright runs feel dampened by the somewhat stilted pulse."
3,"If we wanted to hear the blues, we'd listen to Clapton!","A bold departure for joe. lots of blues. but who wants blues from Satch?! 5 of the 12 songs are more typical Satch from a nice mellow balad in 'Home' through 'Moroccan Sunset', 'Killer Bee Bop' and on to 'My World' with Satch playing his wah-wah leads to some intersting chords.the rest is old world blues.i'd borrow this one - tape 5-6 songs and call it quits.Nothing like Crytal Planet or Surfing with Alien if thats what you're looking for."
1,Doesn't deserve a title.,"Rarely do I want to eject a CD and chuck it out my car window, but this one nearly made me do that. It starts with Cool #9, which has kind of a nice groove; it's been a part of Joe's live set for awhile now. The rest is just so completely unremarkable, it's hard to remember. Part of my dislike of this album comes from the mix; the guitar is moved so far back that it lacks punch, and the drums end up dominating the album's sound. And speaking of which, Satch's drummer on this one is great, but he's absolutely IN LOVE with his assortment of cymbals and china boys. A little of that goes a very long way to me, especially when you're trying to hear the guitar. Who knew Joe Satriani would release such a good drummer's album? Those who have tired of Joe's more progressive stuff and want to hear something sleepy and conventional might enjoy this, but for me, this is his worst album by far. I'll take the much-hated but futuristic 'Engines of Creation' over this any day."
3,Get back to the Satch action!,"Like several other reviewers, I found ""Joe does the blues"" to be somewhat disappointing. I remember before the release of this album reading an interview in the San Francisco Chronicle (Joe is a local) about how excited he was with his new producer who told him to bypass all the special electric guitar enhancements and ""just plug your guitar into the amp and play."" Unfortunately, the sound that resulted is rather boring. His regular style of guitar playing is meant for electronic enhancement! His next album ""Crystal Planet"" is just that - and it delivers!"
5,No Holes Here!,"According to Blues great Albert King, ""If you don't dig the Blues, you got a hole in your soul!"" Joe proves beyond any doubt on his self-titled release, that there are no holes here! It's apparent that he has a love and understanding of the Blues genre, and he displays his understanding well. From the opener, ""Cool #9"" thru the rest of the album, Satch sets you to really crave that next Bluesy lick coming from his wailing guitar! Just put on the headphones, sit back and let Satch take you on a journey thru the Blues. It's a great ride!"
4,Joe is definitely laid back on this one.,"Is this different from other Satriani albums? Yes it is. Does Joe tend to do the same thing twice? No! That's the great thing about this guy. What would be the point of the same thing over and over? On to the songs. The first track, ""Cool #9"" defines the laid back tone of the album but then Joe launches in to the rockin' ""If"". ""Down, Down, Down"", ""S.M.F."" and ""Slow Down Blues"" slow things down a bit (the tempo that is) and ""Home"" is a song with great feeling. ""Luminous Flesh Giants"" is another great rocker and ""(You're) My World"" would certainly belong on any ""Best of"" album. The only track that doesn't seem to fit, IMO, is ""Killer Bee Bop"" but then again, no one's perfect. This is good stuff, just like all of Joe's albums."
4,Joe rocks again,"Once again, Mr Satriani shows why he is a guitar teacher as well as performer. Every track has licks you wish you could go back and listen to in slow motion-a hundred times. I can see him schooling the younger guys that have come in the last ten to twenty years-Vai, Shepherd-and showing them the way (which they have done successfully as well) to make the instrument sing-to make the instrument so very listenable. Having seen the G3 tour a couple of times, I marvel at the way these songs are reproduced live sometimes more than the way they are done in the studio. The album is a must have for any guitar enthusiast."
2,Unreliable; died after a couple months,"I bought this adapter for use with my Suunto X6HR watch. It seemed to work at first when first installed. But on subsequent usage, Windows would fail to properly recognize the adapter. Sometimes unplugging and replugging it would work, other times a reboot would do, and occasionally a reinstall of the driver was required. Also, it seemed to only work in the same USB port as it was originally install.Then after a month or two, it stopped working altogether."
1,Does not work with Vista,"The product did not work with Windows Vista and the manufacturer, CP Technologie (NOT Lexar as listed), refuses to provide the correct driver. Refusal to provide a driver is clearly stated on their web site. Zero customer service, zero support so I just wasted my money."
2,"""Easy Installation""- not at all","The installation information was very specific and easy to understand. However, the inclosed CD did not contain anything near the files described on the instructions.At least they did have a web site that did contain the described file for XP."
1,"""True"" origins - not really","This book simply lacks factual and logical support for the many ""conclusions"" drawn by the author. While the book does contain a useful list of the descendants of William Caudill, the author simply strings together a series of word origins to reach conclusions that have little real, historical support. Rather than a scholarly discusion of competing theories for the origins of the Caudill family and name, this book jumps to conclusions without any anaysis and dismisses competing theories without any real discussion or argument. In short, this book does little to uncover the truth about the Caudill family or name."
3,We're all suckers,"Sort of. At least I just rented this. The Simpson's-a landmark and long running show about a yellow family in a weird town makes great television-not movies. The entire time I was watching this I couldn't believe that this had actually been released in the theatres and was A HIT. The creators are certainly laughing all the way to the bank on this one-and good for them. There is no need to go over the plot-it's no more significant than any other that comes on weekly or daily. Homer is an idiot, he screws up, refuses to be apologetic until his wife leaves him and then he becomes this big lovable goofball that saves the day. End of story. The best part is the little jingle regarding a spider pig. If you're still curious-rent it. Your life won't be any better or worse for it."
2,Better stick to the TV series,"The movie was not bad, but wasn't that good either. Plus, to pay $20.00 for a longer, boring Simpsons episode, I will not make the same mistake again."
3,Good but not great nor necessary,"Really what is the point of adding another opinion to this long list of raves and gripes. What was the point of making a Simpsons movie after a decade and a half? I guess it was just an eventuality. The show has been on auto-pilot after 8 seasons and been less creative and more self-referential, and this doesn't change much in the movie.The movie is mostly enjoyable but hardly necessary to The Simpsons canon. There are funny parts, a few that are unique for the series... the movie is hardly the greatest example of the Simpsons, nor the worst example of the Simpsons. The movie was said to be rewritten over and over by many people, and it shows. Secondary characters are unused, Lisa's sub-plot romance is totally cliche, the pig disappears after the first third of the movie, sub-plots come and go and are forgotten. Not a great movie but some fun. You don't have to buy it, or buy it if you want."
3,it's somewhere between 2 and half and 3,"I feel the Simpsons is a Iconic show no doubt and I feel it's been on tv a bit too long now,but it still has moments. i feel if this film had have been put out 5 or 10 years ago it would have been way better. the film felt a extended version of a Episode and it had some moments,but it didn't knock me out at all. Homer was a trip as always. i wouldn't want another film though. this was decent,but Predictable.Bart, Marge, Lisa had some moments as well. the best thing about the film is how well paced it was."
3,Great disc except for the extras,"I haven't watched the movie yet(saw it in the theater), just got it and checked out the special features. Very dissapointed in the extra stuff. With the capacity of the Blu-Ray disc I expected more. I really wish that Blu-Ray would have web content like HD-DVD but I guess you can't have it all."
3,Meh...,"Wait till its on the TV and watch it for free... or rent it. My complaints? It's just not that funny. There's a bunch of episodes better than this. With the time and the budget they had they this could have been better. I saw it at the drive-in double night for $6, so I feel ok.Does anyone else think that this movie came out ten years too late?"
4,The Simpsons Movie Rules!,"I'm not a huge Simpsons fan but I bought into the hype at the time and went to theaters to see the movie. After all this time, this movie still cracks me up. Pick up the blu-ray as it has a ton of extra content that the dvd does not."
4,Dome!,"The much-beloved TV series translates to the big screen pretty well, and, although it doesn't quite maintain the humour all the way through, there are enough moments of pure Simpsons genius to make this a treat for all fans. I would've liked to have seen more of the characters featured regularly in the series, many of whom make no more than a brief cameo appearance. They provide a good proportion of the laughs on the TV series and are definitely underused here. Also, I found the big-screen music score a little out of place at times. But on the whole this is an amusing movie with much of the wit and charm of the TV show."
4,Unbox Bug.,Unbox says that I can play this rental upto November 2nd 2008 but never lets be play it again.The Simpsons Movie
2,"well, hopefully there's no sequel","Horribly overrated, this film follows in the footsteps of recent seasons with lackluster writing and gags that wear out their welcome. I definitely got the feeling that this was a 45 minute show fluffed into a feature film format. The film is also Homer-centric. Bart's character is less than true to form as he goes soft as the story progresses... as a result we get few gags out of him. There is little to no interaction with the townspeople who make the show so dynamic. All in all, the story is less compelling than some of the 23 minute ones and the execution does little to help it out.Apparently, the writers realized that Simpsons fans such as myself have been waiting so long for a movie that just about anything thrown up on the screen would have sold.By the way... on a fullscreen, some gags will make no sense."
2,Overhype!,"This movie is Overhype and start off slow, very slow. I have been watching the Simpsons for years and just felt like it should have been more. I felt watching film, suck my life out of me. It was a major rip off to the world. The movie was too long, it could have been better watching a regular 30 minute episode on TV. Homer Simpson even jokes about this in the begining credit saying watching this movie we are all suckers and could have watch it for free on TV. Things I do like are The Simpsons world. They don't have to explain about orgins or anything because you know the characters. There is an element of crudeness that you will notice in the movie that is not on TV, example Homer gives the bird. Ok in all, rent it before buyin it."
1,Not Worth It,"I grew up watching The Simpsons on the television, so when Fox decided to come out with a Simpsons movie, well, figured I'd like to watch it. Unfortunately, what might have been a great movie decided to be less of a piece of entertainment and more of a political piece of crap. I bought this movie expecting to be entertained, expecting to find something to laugh at. However, I found less humor and more of the creator's/producer's political ideology and social commentary. I found less laughs and more mocking of a person or persons' way of life simply because the producers/creators didn't agree with them. I subsequently gave the movie away. If I wanted politics and outright social commentary, I'd search for it myself. I don't want to be force-fed someone else's point-of-view and be mocked for disagreeing with it."
2,sad sad sad,This is another case of trying too hard to make a good product. The days of the good Simpsons (both the TV show and this movie) have past.I love the Simpsons and hoped that the move was going to be good...
2,Deception,"The Simpsons Movie has the same defects that the last seasons of The Simpsons the Series...Just a few laughs, the common place, ultra forced situations and an idiotic (really really idiotic) plot...The music, composed by Zimmer is also a drawback...I prefer the less pompous but more effective music by Elfman in the difficult task of emphasize the few laughable moments in the movie...I didn't see the movie in a movie theater and I don't regret it...Thanks God I just rented the movie in Blockbuster...Save your money for something better."
2,"Very poor showing, skip it and watch an old Simpsons episode","Well, it really was painful to watch. There were a few honest to goodness funny segments and they were all in the previews. The writing is extremely hacked and predictable. They turn Homer into a character you simply can't connect or sympathize with at all. It was a really bad, bad showing. Do yourself a favor and skip this and go watch any episode from say seasons 3-9 and be a much happier person for it."
2,Jaded and barely watchable,"It's all been said. Homer isn't a lovable dope; he is a callous, unfeeling, completely selfish ingrate. No substance to the film. The ""messages"" of environmentalism and the EPA run rampant are unserious and ultimately trivial. It's one thing to apply absurdities and bizarre exaggerations in a plot, but this film is disconnected from anything real or meaningful, including issues, characters, narratives, or anything else that can sustain interest; The Simpsons is nothing more than a timid Family Guy. Good for cheap laughs. Period. It's a totally jaded film. And the funniest joke in the movie involves Homer gluing his hands to his groin. Hilarious.A few clever slapstick jokes keep the film from being a total waste of time; but it's much closer to one star than 3 stars. It's a shame that nearly 200 people thought this dreck amounted to a 5-star classic."
2,Please let them die before everyone hates them,"Don't get me wrong, i love the Simpsons... at least, i used to. If you watched the show you know your favorite episode, your favorite quote, the time you sprayed milk, beer, nyquil, outta your nose over some line or scene. And you know that hasn't happened in YEARS. The movie should remind of us those olden days, and would be good but for the fact that it's not funny, crappily written, and dependent on thinking of Homer and the brood as even dumber than The Family Guy. And i held out hope thinking that they'd try to recapture the magic for their last magical go-round. Wrong. WRONG! SpiderPig is the only clever thing in it. And who the hell is Arnold Whatever... isn't his real name Ranier Wolfcastle? Anyway, see it at the dollar theater and boo."
2,Consider the South Park movie for a comparison,"I couldn't finish this movie. I didn't bother to see it in the theaters and even had trepidation about renting it as I have felt the Simpsons TV show has been unwatchable for years. My fears were justified--the movie is as uninspired as the last 8-10 years of the show.Consider ""South Park-Bigger,Longer, Uncut"". That movie came out when South Park had only been on TV a couple of years--and it is brilliant (IMHO)! They were in their prime and the writing and the music (it's a musical!) were inspired.To bad the Simpsons team waited until they had an empty shell of the original inspired series (which should be laid to rest) before cashing in (and cashing in is all it is) on a big screen release.Very sad..."
2,Not even a good episode,"With so much debate over older seasons vs. newer seasons, I have to say that I have enjoyed every season much more than I enjoyed this movie. This was not made for die-hard fans, and lacks most of what makes the Simpsons so entertaining.I won't belabor what others have said, but I will repeat it: Short shrift for the supporting cast, angry Homer not funny Homer, tedious ""message"" movie, deficit of jokes. Just so very, very disappointing. But it did make money and some people liked it...ugh!"
4,A Suprising Success,"I had worried how well the Simpsons movie would be after watching the new Simpsons episodes a few times before- which I think are pretty weak and yes not very funny anymore. I worried, like the majority of the show's fans, that the movie would be just the same.My worries washed away after minutes of starting the movie. It definitely started out funny, and stayed strong till the end. There were certain parts of the movie that were less humorous than the others, but overall I was kept pretty well entertained. I agree with others that it had for the most part brought back the magic of the show's old episodes everyone loved and still does.The plot was fun, the characters overall more funnier than they usually are nowadays, and Spider Pig will definitely go down in history. A success of a film.4/5"
4,Never Really Watched the Show; Loved The Movie!,"I don't know why I never really got into the Simpsons. I just never bothered. It's always there though, year after year, donut after donut. I gave in and went to the movie with my son and his friend just for the heck of it. Well, I left loving the movie and will definately buy the DVD so my husband can watch. (we know my son will watch it time after time!) Very fun, with many pop culture references and adult humor to please even the crabbiest of viewers. If you love the Simpsons, you'll love the movie. If you don't, you might just love it too."
4,Homer do good?,"Homer must save Springfield from a catastrophe he has created after Homer dumps a silo of pig droppings into the lake. A vengeful mob descends onto the household with flaming torches. The Simpson family makes a narrow escape to Alaska, as Springfield descends into anarchy and mayhem after the (US) government seals the town off from the world under a glass dome. In the end Homer redeems himself by saving Springfield. A movie long episode covering family relationships, religion, politics, environmental issues and the American way with classic humor and sillyness. Buy it now or else I will sing the Spiderpig song!"
3,it was ok,it was ok but not what was i looking for i thought it was going to be great but after watching the 2nd time i thought it was quite boring
2,the simpson movie,"the movie is insanely funny.i could view it 100 times,but i find itannoying,the audio repeats itself throughout the movie. i don't knowif the cd is at fault,or my dvd player is messing up.i dont seem to expierience this behavior on other cd's in my collection.richard"
4,An Exciting movie!!!!,Simpsons the movie is an exciting wonderful classic!!! This expands on the already world famous Simpsons series. The plot is global arming/ pollution in Springfield and the town of springfield is capsulated. Will the simpson learn their lesson? Will the Simpson be saved? I don't want to give to much away but the capsulated thing kind of did.
3,DVD,The 'little ones' love THE SIMPSONS Movie. You will see them rolling on the floor laughing at the antics of the characters. They will beg again and again to see this movie over and over...
2,Movie Didn't Show in Widescreen,"When I viewed this movie on a PS3, the video was shrunk (like it was trying to be played on a 4:3 tv) and I had to zoom on my TV to make it full widescreen (which cut off some of the video).This has never happend with any of my other Blu-ray or DVDs."
4,"What you expect, not much more.","For fans of The Simpsons, this is a very entertaining movie. A bit front loaded with laughs. Just about what I expected. Nothing more nothing less. If you don't particularly care for THe Simpsons, this movie is not for you. If you enjoy and/or love The Simpsons, it is a must have."
4,Spiderpig?,I purchased this movie for my son. He has been watching the Simpsons since their appearance on television. He has a small collection of certain seasons and wanted the movie too. Although he said that it could have been even funnier he really enjoyed the movie and views it over and over again.
3,Waste of Movie Time...,"There was really nothing special about this ""movie"" that would have been different if it were made for TV. It just seemed like they copped out."
4,Funny stuff,"The Simpson's Movie is a funny movie, and if you're a fan of the series your enjoyment of it will increase. I might be biased since I myself am a fan of the series, but I really think this is a pretty great movie, pretty darn funny indeed. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,"Great movie, but lacking in extras.","If you are a fan of the Simpsons TV show then owning this movie is a no-brainer. The movie looks and sounds great in Blu-ray. But my only complaint is that the extras are lacking. There is commentary, but these guys are in love with themselves. They are constantly talking over one another. They do manage to mention some interesting trivia about the Simpsons, but since they all seem to like talking at once it gets tough to listen to. Bottom line, buy this one, but get it one sale and don't expect more than the movie."
4,Good movie.,"I remember seeing this in the theaters, and I loved it. It probably wasn't worth the money to see something that I could watch for free on TV, and I wouldn't pay 20 dollars to own the DVD. I bought this DVD for 5 dollars at Target on black friday and I would say that it is worth it."
1,Patchwork.,"This movie has the same problem that the series did, it has too many individual pieces that are edited together. For instance, their was an episode where a mailman was found frozen with hundreds of undelivered peices of mail. That in and of itself would have made a great episode but the mailman was only mentioned as an afterthought. The same goes for this movie as well, it is several good, independant ideas for a tv show or movie all thrown together with tidbits of environmental jargon thrown in to make it appear as if it is one complete movie. It is not, and this method has only fooled a couple of people. Perhaps there are too many writers all contributing nonsense."
1,"Simpsons, just stop already.","The Simpsons used to be great. Season's 4-8 were brilliant. Now, sadly, the show has become the Saturday Night Live of animation. I suspect it's still on because Fox can't think of anything to replace it with and it hasn't been funny for years. This film should be the final nail in the coffin. Please don't waste your time. Watch Family guy instead."
1,Like the Simpsons; Hate the Movie,"I like the Simpsons TV show. I think it is very funny. But this movie is bad.One reason it is not funny is because so much of the movie takes place outside Springfield, the supporting characters that usually make the Simpsons have bit roles at best.It is bad because it's portrayal of the family and specifically the relationship between Homer and Bart is bleak, and lacking in love and hope in a way that goes way beyond the normal tension in the series. I felt discouraged and depressed after watching the movie because I know there are real people in the world who really have relationships with their family like that, and it is not funny at all.All that, and the story was dumb."
1,"MATT GROENING PLEASE ""STOP"" MAKING THE SIMPSONS!!!","THE SIMPSONS SEASONS 2 THRU 6 ARE THE ""ONLY"" GOOD SIMPSONS THERE ARE.WATCHING BEYOND SEASON SIX MAKES MY SKIN CRAWL.THE SIMPSONS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!MATT GROENING SHOULD BE ARRESTED AND PUT IN JAIL FOR HIS CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY AND FOR HIS CRIME AGAINST THE ORIGINAL SIMPSONS SHOWS!!!"
3,Simpson snips are best,"Since discovering the Simpson family years ago, I absolutely love them! It takes several viewing to catch much of their material even in the short half hour programs which are consistently wonderful.I'm not sure a full length movie can possibly do as much for the viewer. The movie is worth the having and viewing and I aim to view it several more times soon, but the initial viewing was disapointing.JimElzie"
3,"Alright only, not that great -> and I'ma Simpsons fan!","This movie should have been so much more, sadly it is draggy at certain parts. It feels much more like a collection of clips put together to get a movie, somewhat like the old Looney Tunes movies like Daffy Duck's Fantastic Island."
4,If you are a True Simpsons fan you will love this movie,This a fun movie with laughs galore. The movie starts with a Green Day concert at Springfield. The rock band tries to encourage the citizens to care about the environment which is meet with boos and beer bottles until the stage collapses along with the rock band in the river. Then while in church Grandpa Simpsons gets the holy spirit and rolls around and spells doom for Springfield unless they change(funny stuff). If you think the movie is funny wait until you see the DVD Features.
3,D'OH! THE SIMPSONS MOVIE Just Gets 3 Out Of 5 Doughnuts!,"I love THE SIMPSONS when it is at its cleverest and even the most poorly written episodes are more enjoyable then a lot of what television currently has to offer. Unfortunately, though it has some funny moments, this film version lacks the brilliance of the golden years and has more in common with the more mediocre recent shows. In fact the movie seems like one of the more current ordinary installments just stretched a bit to make it to acceptable feature film length. True fans (like myself) won't want to miss it but it is likely to puzzle anyone who hasn't been following the show's irreverent humor and quirky characters for years as they won't get many of the insider's references to the series."
3,Not their best work,I love the show but for me the movie didn't quite live up to the usual standards. Worth watching if you're a fan though.
5,Homer does it again!,"I had heard that if you like ""The Simpsons"", that this was just like a 2 hour episode. In some ways this was true, but I felt like the writers actually got a chance to be more creative and expressive in this format. I felt that the artwork was dramatically better than the weekly show. It almost looks 3D to me. (Neat Idea!).If you saw the movie, the first episode from this season had little details for the movie that wouldn't make sense to most that didnt see it - in the opening credits, ie, Bart writing on the blackboard at school 'I will not wait another 20 years to make a movie'. and Homer arrives to the driveway with the silo labled ""Pig Cr*p"" tied to the roof of his car.I enjoyed it so much I ordered it from Amazon the moment it was announced on preorder - but then, I just love ""The Simpsons"". If you love them too, how could you miss this deeper look into their lives... and Marge and Homer's eternal committment to each other and their family?"
4,The One Thing We Sat and Watched as a Family,weekly we would sit and watch this show. I like the simpsons and the humor on all levels.
3,I Wasn't Impressed,"Nothing here you haven't seen a hundred times before, and unless you're really impressed by Marge saying a ""bad word"", Homer giving bystanders the finger, or the momentary sight of partial frontal nudity (are the Simpsons European, by the way?) this is nothing to dash out and buy. It's not bad, just nothing all that special, either."
4,"Enjoyable, just not a place for little kids!!!","This movie is perfect for fans of the TV series, and does not stray too far from it's blend of comedy and irony. They push the jokes a bit futher than they do on tv, and that is why it's PG-13. There were several parts that I found myself chuckling too, and the storyline is always pretty original, but the really young kids around me made the initial experience unpleasent. Kids under about 10 have no real business being at this movie. Leave your young ones at home and come have some fun at this big screen debut."
3,so-so,"I've been watching The Simpsons since I was 8 and they were on the Tracy Ullman Show. The show now is a shell of its former self. Seasons 3-7 were genius, and those days are long gone. So I knew going in it wouldn't be the brilliant satire of old. I must say though, the movie was a lot better than the series has been for the last several years. It was nowhere near the level of season 3 or 4, but I was pleasantly surprised. 6.5/10."
2,Spider Pig was the only funny scene.,"Well, the Eskimo lady was also pretty cool.I am a huge fan of The Simpsons. I like almost every season of The Simpsons, even the new seasons.The Simpsons movie was pretty lame. The plot involved Homer Simpson trying to save the town of Springfield from being bombed off the map.The focus of the movie was on Homer Simpson's basic adventure and not on any of the other interesting characters. I was very dismayed by that. Mr. Burns didn't even have any sneaky plans to implement on anyone.Well it was a dull movie and I would wait to rent it or see at a discount movie theater."
2,"Meh, not worth keeping in the collection","I own the first 10 seasons of the Simpsons and they are great. This movie was very forced comedy... lots of ""get it?"" humor which the Simpsons seasons are not known for very much, if at all, but this ""movie"" seemed to be nothing but. Some funny parts, but overall a dud. Seeing Bart's ""child pornographic"" image was just catering to what? The sex offender pederast Simpson loyal? Pointless. And the shots at God and Christianity were pointless and not funny, as was Marge's curse at the end of the movie. Forced, forced, forced. The only thing that could have saved this one was Dancin' Pete, and I'll make him dance by pawning this for a nickel."
1,Disappointed,The movie was in french which I do not speak and I am having trouble trying to return it.
1,"""Spider Pig AAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA""",People who watch the Simpsons know its not funny anymore I just wish the people in denial would let it die.
1,I waited 6 years for this?,"Im 12 years old and I've beign watching the simpsons scince I was 6 years old and I thought that someday they'll make a movie of them just as great as the earlier seasons but I was wrong.The plot of the movie is very stupid and it envolved enviromental awareness witch is a serious thing and the movie ended beign serious and not funny, It would had beign more funny if homer, instead of polluting the lake, would had accidentally shut down the tv cable system of the whole country.Besides the source of inspiration of the produccers consisted only in the spider pig part, the spider pig part was the only part which the produccers tought good, the rest of the movie was unthinked and fast buildedThis movie is lame and as I said it before, I couldn't beleave that I waited 6 long years to see this super, duper, mega, ultra CRAP!"
1,on word ruins this movie.....,Towards the end of the movie they use the word G D....taken Gods name in vien.
1,A Country Bore,"As I loved the James Herriot books, I had high expectations of this latest foray into a country vet's existence, albeit in more modern times. Instead I found this book to be poorly written; the plot was lame and predictable, the dialogue was stilted and unbelievable, the characters one dimensional and the few actual vet stories seemed to draw heavily from the Herriot books. The Australian vet Scott was as stereotypical as he could possibly be and the reformation of Kate's creepy, stalking suitor seemed extremely unlikely.I have no intention of reading any of the other books in this series."
4,Good read,"The Barleybridge series revolves around the personal and professional lives of the staff of a veterinary practice in an English village. In this first novel of the series, Kate begins work at the hospital. Although she harbors the secret desire to become a veterinarian herself, one failing grade has dashed these hopes and set her to working as an accountant and receptionist instead. However, Kate soon finds that she is not content to work on the fringes of the practice, despite the tight bonds with the other staff, particularly the wild Australian, Scott. The practice is full of interesting characters and cases.Quote: ""It doesn't make sense. I'll be off. Where's my billhook? That sparky young lass took it off me.""This book is engaging because of a cast of characters that covers all your bases - annoying, endearing, quiet, fiery. The two characters who make up the focus of this novel, Kate and Scott, make you root for their improbable coupling, and the supporting cast also shine."
4,A great cross-section,"""Prime Cuts"" is a best-of album so, you either like ST or you don't. Being a 20-year ST fan, I love having a cross-section of their material. (Personally, I was surprised the ""Controlled by Hatred"" didn't make the cut (no pun intended). If you're not a ST fan, then this is a great introduction. They never really made it big but they had some great material. Any interest in skater-thrash or metal? If so, ST is for you."
4,Suicidal Tendencies - 'Prime Cuts:Best Of' (Sony),"Well,what do you know?I was rummaging through some CD's I haven't heard in awhile and I came across this.'Prime Cuts' features tunes from five out of eight(at the time of this release,anyway)S.T. albums,plus two new songs ""Beserk"" and ""Feed The Addiction"".I've never been all THAT huge of a Suicidal fan,but I've always liked some of their better known material,here like ""Institutionalized"",their total ass kick-in-the-groin ""Pledge Your Allegiance"" and ""How Will I Laugh Tomorrow"".An added bonus to this disc is the art that appears on the back cover.Top of the line punk/thrash.Check it out.A should-have."
3,The Mona Lisa Looked Great Without a Mustache,"The originals are great, as expected; the re-recorded songs STINK. Get the original records."
4,GET IT!!,"Of all the Suicidal Tendencies's cds this is deffinently one of the best released. Almost all the songs are sick, not just a couple like most albums. Overall this is a really sick cd!! Totally worth the money. I'd give it a 5 star if I thought there could be a perfect album."
1,Difficulties with book title,"I was searching for the book ""Love in the Time of Cholera"" and thought I had ordered it. What came was a reader's guide to the book. I could not ascertain this from the website. In essence, I didn't understand what I bought. Very disappointing."
4,Good quick start,"This book basically nailed what I needed down.It's kind of ironic that the book has this little joke about you (the reader) being asked to redo the corporate website over a weekend, which is Exactly what happened to me. Anyway, you basically build a front page on a website, with some animations. The book doesn't get into the why, just the how, which is sometimes a good thing. Once I went through the first few chapters, Flash became so obvious that I stopped using the book and built the rest of the sample page by eye. That's not bragging, I'm just saying that once you get a kick in the right direction, like the kick this book provides, you will be doing all kinds of things with it.-M"
4,Great Book For a novice,"This book is a great thing to have for anybody who's completely new to flash (a bit of experience with other programs will help a lot).They explain very well and their instructions are very detailed and informative. And you won't believe the sites you create in the end.Basically, this book tells you 95% of the complete flash. Very recommended.END"
1,"""not-so-essential"" Flash 4!","As an advanced Flash user and working web/graphics professional I would say that this book is not essential for web professionals. I didn't learn a thing from this book, I've learned much more from many other Flash books, but not this one! This book covered very little in a very complicated manner. I was dissapointed with the complex way in which simple concepts were explained. I would not recommend this book."
2,"Okay, but online tutorials are better","While an okay beginner resource, I found this book to be little more than a rehash of Darrel Plant's Flash books of two years ago. The improvements of Flash 4 over Flash 3 are numerous, and aside from a brief description of MP3 compression I found few references to them. Additonally, the FS Command and Tell Target features (which are central to Flash 4's increased interactivity) are ignored, and the advanced tutorials on the Generator toolbar and scriptibility functions are missing entirely. By and large, I found this book a waste of my money and will caution potential designers to look elsewhere if they want anything but an enhancement of the Macromedia-written Flash manual."
2,"Not for ""professionals""","While I had an idea this title was for beginners, the name of the book makes other implications ""...for Web Professionals"". This title is not for ""Web Professionals""...at least not as I know the term. This is strictly a beginner book that provides precious little and often times less (when it comes to ActionScript and similar powerful new capabilities) than the manual offers. The ""professional"" portion of the title for the book is inapporpriate for the content."
1,Even don't for the beginner...,"I prefer to have several books on one subject, if you can not find some information in one book , there is every time a possibility to find it in another book, but this one so useless.It is almost impossible to do exercise because step-by-step described in this book just doesn't work. Also if you trying to work with downloadable exercises they are sometimes absolutely different from book information. For example button action. You can reed in the book (p.76):""By changing the spheres to buttons in the middle and last keyframe, and leaving the first keyframe as a graphic, we are telling Flash to treat them as buttons after the 15-th keyframe...""But in download example all three keyframes are buttons. This example work fine, but yours made from book working very strange.I would suggest for beginners and intermediate buying ""Flash for Windows and Macintosh (Visual Quickstart Guide)""."
4,Better than I expected,"Fairly easy to follow, except that some of the steps make you think ""WHAT??"" and you have to read it over to understand. Seems that some steps are missing when they are explaining a process you may have already done in a past chapter. The one thing that bothered me the most is that pages you apply to one finished webpage are missing from the phptr.com site. Ok, enough rants..It was very helpful to learn basic and advanced steps and I'd recommend it!"
4,Absolutely super!,Have been having problems working with Flash4 and this was a quick solution to my problems. Now things are working the way they should.
3,erratic service,"I bought the unit because I wanted recording and fm capability. The H10 is beautiful and it looks very solidly made, much stronger than Ipods. However, it frozed up and when I finally found out how to unfreeze it from the web, all information on it was gone. The telephone support is only mon-fri to 5pm. I sent several emails to the company but I am still to get a response."
4,Best Godfather's Album,"In my mind, this is the best album the Godfather's ever produced. No-nonsense guitar based rock, born in the 80's and giving birth to the early 90's alternative rave. Unfortunately, they never caught on and are doomed to be another forgotten wonder."
1,Not a good start for GC,"Lately I have been told GC is the best. There is no denying that but it lacks sports games. Now that I bought FIFA WORLD CUP, I regret it. Just rent it and you'll see how poor it is in every aspect. i don not recommened it. This is from a serious sports fan. no way jose!"
5,best soccer game for game cube,"This is the best soccer game for game cube. it's the first time game cube has launched a good soccer game. anyway, if you like soccer buy this game."
2,Not what you might expect,"I've read all of the other Rowan Gant series of books and enjoyed them. The subject of this book is bondage; I found the book a fairly unpleasant read. It's a well-written book, but I ended up just recycling it. I will be more cautious with future titles by this author."
3,Good but not Great,"I think Otto Undercover was not as interesting of a book as I thought it would be based on a recommendation from my Language Arts teacher. It had okay humor, but I think Otto's aunts aren't right for the story. They're not palindromes which I don't get because the story is about palindromes, and Otto has a racecar named Racecar. [Hint: read Racecar backwards.] I recommend this book for kids age 8 and younger.by Zachk"
2,Not Good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Otto Undercover: Born toDriveIn Rhea Pearlman's book, Otto Undercover: Born to Drive awfulness jumps higher than a forest frog! With crude illustrations and abnormally stupid villains, Pearlman's book is a disaster. I also think that the idea of a kid being able to build the fastest racecar on the planet and make high-tech gadgets is stupid. The only good part about the book is all the word puzzles. In short, I do not like Otto Undercover."
4,Perfect for young children,Simple factual text and brightly colored pictures in clear black outlines all combine to make this a book that should be fascinating to toddlers.
2,Building a House,"I have no complaints about the book itself. The colors are vibrant and it is fun. However, there isn't enough text. When I bought this I at least exspected a paragraph every page or so. This is a picture book with a few words. I would not have purchased it for my children (Middle Elementary age) had I know that one fact. Great for preschool aged children. Stacey"
4,A Great Early Lesson in Architecture,"Byron Barton's deceptively simple cartoon-like drawings and streamlined text may seem unimpressive at first glance. But this author has a distinctive gift for distilling essential components of any event or theme into a page-turningly smooth story that the youngest child can follow. In this volume, he describes and illustrates the step-by-step construction of a family home, beginning with ""a green hill"" with land surveyors pictured, and ending with a family moving into the home. It's an excellent early lesson in architecture for any child, but particularly those young children who show an interest in how objects in their environment work."
3,Little disappointed,"This book had some great pictures and gave good information about what happens when you build a house.I must say that I was disappointed in the incredibly short sentences. I should have known it would be like that considering the author, but I guess I thought the subject was a little more advanced so maybe the language would be too. Nope."
2,boring,This book had great promise when I read the back cover but it didn't live up to it at all. I was bored almost from page one. The characters seemed superficial. The plot sounded good but was never really developed. The idea of good batttling evil was wonderful but it wasn't much of a battle. I wish this had been better but it wasn't I was really disappointed.
5,La Musique Belle,"I was first introduced to Hélène Segara through ""Notre-Dame de Paris"" - I loved her voice, so I tried this CD. I love it. My mastery of French is rudimentary, but the music is awsome - and there's all different kinds. I love it, and I'm so glad I took the chance and bought it!"
3,"When she sings ""Vivre"" she is an angel -- must hear!","""Vivre"" is from ""Notre Dame de Paris."" The rest of the CD contains some good songs but nothing like the first one. You've got to hear ""Vivre."""
3,Its's okay!!,"This item is okay for the price you pay for it. It is very strechy, and pretty comfy once you figure out how to adjust it and put it on properly. Good services were provided however i would not make the same purchase again."
2,uhhh,"i thought this thing was gonna look good on me well it doesn't It seems you have to be pen thin for it too. I am not heavy but I do have curves and I have a butt, so I don't recommend this if you have a rear cause it's not going to look good, I can't even ware it around the house till I loose my butt."
1,Unsatisfied,You have to be super short to wear this or it just turns into a shirt...very unsatisfied with item.
1,Overwhelmed by photographs and images.,"This book is full of photographs depicting the ancient and modern. The trouble is, it is overly so. There are a number of instances where the images and their captions fail to cover little more than half a page - leaving a lot of white paper doing nothing. Elsewhere, some small ancient wood-carvings appear to have been enlarged to occupy a full half page and, in so doing, the effect is lost.Page after page of picture after picture coupled with a large text in ""bold"" gives the impression these authors had little to say about Columbus and opted to pad out the book with pictures. There is an overview of Columbus's life in there somewhere - for those who want to look. If, however, you are in the mood for searching, my advice is to look elsewhere.NM"
5,Great Action Playing Game,"I just played this game at a nearby game store and it was so fun and realistic. In comparison: if you liked NHL 2002 because of its (realty) then you will enjoy this game so much. This game is not like any of that NHL HITZ stuff where they don't even play by the rules, this game is intense and i recomend it to anyone who loves soccer."
1,You can't hide a bad game with good music,"Once you get over all the glorious pomp and circumstance what you're left with is a horribbly slow game that is almost constantly bogging. The new juggling feature is the token ""bullet point"" on the game box that adds nothing to the game. For years EA has been counting on the FIFA license for sales, rather than quality game play - don't waste your time this franchise get yourself Pro Evolution from Konami if you want a sim - or RedCard from Midway if you want fun."
4,GGGGGGGGGGGGGGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLL!,"this game is well animated, with good looking stadiums. the controls are nice. wonderful music and sound effects.the play is nice nice options. the only bad thing is that there are only limited teams.So go out and spend your money on this game and spend hours in front of the tv"
3,2002 FIFA World Cup,"As the first soccer game on the Xbox, I have to say 2002 FIFA World Cup is easily the most fun to play. The fact that soccer translates to videogames so well and EA's attention to detail when it comes to gameplay kept me engrossed for weeks. That's saying something considering all of the different games that come through here.But you're getting very little in the way of features and options with this game. The DVD extras are cool with a few featurettes but there's nothing too outstanding. The World Cup license is the game's greatest strength and weakness. All of the emotion and pageantry of the tournament is here, but I'm not sure that's enough of to make up for all of the stuff EA couldn't include. I love FIFA and wish the 2003 version could include a full blown World Cup mode because I know a World Cup without options and features comes up a little short."
3,No Good Modes!,"This is a wonderful set up game. The controlls are great and the gameplay is awesome. But, this game had no good modes. All it has is Single game and World Cup. Add a Season and Franchise and I might change my mind and make it a 4 star, but that is life and I hope life is better next year."
3,Another piece of EA Sports trash.,"Why does EA Sports think that we bought a XBox to play Playstation 2 games. It is so obvious that they don't even bother to make it look or play any better. Do they think that we can't tell the difference? Come on Microsoft, you've shown them how to make football and basketball, now I think they need a lesson on the soccer field."
4,GOAL!!!,The real deal when it comes down to graphics and playability. Soccer has come a long way in the gaming world and FIFA 2002 does a great job holding its position. Worth the purchase.
4,Great Resource for traveling,The book was well written and organized. It was easy to look up information about all different types of subjects. We used this book on our trip to Cancun and we maximized our adventures during our stay.Jim Kerr
2,Nearly impossible to wire,"This switch has a very unusual method for connecting the speaker wires. You insert the stripped wire into a tiny chamber. Then you tighten a tiny phillips head screw to push a lid down to capture the wire. The product description states that it will accept wires up to 14 ga but I found that I needed to clip about 1/2 of the strands of my 14 ga wire to get it to go into the hole. The ""clamping"" action is not very secure and I have spent about 1/2 hour trying to get the wires clamped down without allowing the previously inserted wires to slip out--and I still haven't been successful! This doesn't include the time spent visiting the hardware store to purchase a '00' size phillips screwdriver. In retrospect, I wish I had just bought a pair of DPDT toggle switches instead."
3,Speaker switch,This switch is not as sophisticated as I had anticipated. It will serve the purpose but I would like to avoid direct no-load switching.
5,Brilliant Indie Film,"Still the Drums is a passionate and engaging first work from a doggedly creative writer-director-actor. This is a moving, character-driven contemporary drama with a surprising Vietnam-era back story that has contemporary relevance for a country that keeps getting stuck in wars that exact enormous hidden costs. The film tells the story of three Vietnam vets who have been quietly carrying the secret burden of the brutality of war for decades. The story is told simply, but creatively, unfolding in an engaging narrative that rarely stumbles. The acting, the cinematography, and the editing are all first-rate. This is no amateur production. Talbot Simons and his collaborators have created a genuine work of cinematic art worth watching more than once. You won't find this in theaters, so buy it. And recommend it to your firends.--Larry Constantine (Lior Samson, author ofBashertandThe Dome)"
1,TIRESOME GIBBERISH,"I got about 200 pages into this book, and then gave up. I just found it so tiresome. Most of the book is dialogue, but meaningless gibberish dialogue. On and on goes the dialogue and internal thoughts of the characters, but to me it was such meaningless nonsense. They analyze themselves, they analyze the meaning of life, they analyze one another. But really, not much happens. The book, as far as I got, was simply endless nonsensical dialogue--I assume existentialist philosophy. Maybe I am too logical and rational for all this bizarre philosophy, but i just didn't care about the characters at all or what it was they were trying to understand about their lives!"
4,Highly recommended,I would recommend this to anyone who studies the Bible.I really like the layout of Jensen.Highly recommend for Sunday School teachers.
2,Extremely detailed,"This book is for lovers of detail only, not for the casual reader. I struggled to finish it but just couldn't."
3,A fair imitation of Sports illustrated swimsuit DVDs,"A decent DVD with beautiful girls and a good picture quality, even if not a level of the DVDs of Sports Illustrated swimsuit."
2,Travesty,"I've enjoyed many UFOTV videos through the years. I might not always agree with the content, but it is fascinating to hear some of the theories. I previously owned HOAGLAND'S MARS on VHS and those tapes look better than these DVDs! I suspect that the master tapes no longer exist. These transfers are obviously taken from VHS tapes, replete with dropouts. The image is VERY soft...which is sort of ironic, given that Hoagland uses extensive graphics in these talks.I think UFOTV needs to reconsider their pricing scheme. I actually feel very offended and ripped off that they are charging over $70 for material of this quality. I've seen many of their other DVDs (of more recent source material) that look quite good.If you can find this for $20 or under, that's great. Otherwise, this poor quality is not worth it. I am sorry to say this, really I am."
5,Time to Revisit Kubie,"I had a discussion with a psychiatrist yesterday about creative people. To my surprise, I brought up the book by Dr. Kubie, ""The Neurotic Distortion of the Creative Process,"" which I had not read since I started my career as a writer in adverting over 40 years ago. Now that I see his book is still available, I want to read it again. His thoughts have stayed with me for these many years and deserve a refresher course."
4,The Harmless People,The book is a fascinating and easy read. It ultimately details the ending of the Bushman's way of life in the Kalahari. One can easily compare the Bushman's plight with other native tribes in other countries.
3,Knife defeats the smooth and sleek design,"I have this flatware that I purchased several years ago. I decided to add to my service. Nambe has changed the design and added a serrated edge to the knife. In my opinion, it defeats the purpose of the sleekness of the design. I'm pretty sure that the new knife edges will scratch the existing knives unless I some how keep them from rubbing each other as I open and close the drawer.Great knife before some one decided to ""improve"" upon the design!"
4,it was for a gift for an old sailor,It was a gift for a man who was in the Navy on a destroyer during the Korean War. He liked it.
3,Interesting memoir of a sailor,"Blood and sweat were never far from E. J. Jernigan's memory when he wrote this memoir. He had the luxury to absorb the little things that took place both in and out of combat that not all others had, ranging from sailors hitting their shin bones while responding to calls to general quarters to seeing flying fish leaping out of the water, sometimes ending up on ship decks.Although he refrained from using the dirty language that he admitted to have learned during these years, his first-person narrative did not skirt around the some of the less-than-innocent issues such as visiting whore houses and picking up loose women. For that reason, consideration should be taken for the younger readers.Tin Can Man provided an insightful and entertaining glimpse into the daily lives of the common sailors in the WW2-era US Navy and the camaraderie between the men. Recommended.This review of Tin Can Man is a snippet from the website WW2DB.com"
4,Dangerous undertow,"Few authors can make me sit down and read a book right through. Cory is one of them. I enjoy his writing style, I love his characters, and I laugh at his humor.Psychopathic Spanish killer Moreno has escaped from prison to help KGB chief Feramontov recover the 'Spyglass logbooks' which tell of political secrets hidden in a U-boat sunk at the end of World War II.Johnny Fedora and his Foreign Office side-kick Sebastian Trout had to be called in to deal with the threat of the dangerous and unstable Moreno as the violence escalates along the sunny Mediterranean coast.Franco's police are involved in the move to track Moreno. But in the end it's was up to Johnny Fedora to foil the KGB and deal with Moreno in a scuba dive battle inside a wrecked submarine.As usual for this author, this well-written, action-packed book that is a really good read, especially if relaxing on holiday, such as on a Spanish beach, away from any stray bullets."
4,Loose yourself in the story,"It's a psychological thriller that grips your mind in such a way that you can really feel as if you are right there in between the plot. The brutality, expertise and pycho nature of the villain has been captured very well. His name is Moreno and he's a Spanish psychopathic killer. He really fills you with dread. The story starts with his escape from the prison. KGB intelligence chief Feramontov has helped him to escape after eight years of prison to use him for recovering some political secrets. So the British Intelligence sends Johnny Fedora and Sebastian Trout.They have to not only track Moreno but also stop the KGB operation.Even as they try to investigate they discover that the plot is even more deeper. The characters and the story suck the reader into the plot.You can really feel the tension and the thrill."
3,mid weight jacket,"I thought this was to be a lightweight jacket but it's not. The lining is warm and the shell appears wind and water resistant. I was just looking for a windbreaker which was lightly lined for those days in the '40's, not something for the low 30's.JB"
1,Poor illustration,"The photo illustration in this book is unusable because the publisher use duo tone color instead of grayscale gradation.Apart from that, I think the book provides useful pointer and insight to the particular jian style."
1,another waste of time,slow moving and a huge waste of time..... i should have saved my money..... cameron diaz did not come up smelling of roses
4,It will keep you interested,"*** Minor spoilers ***The plot itself is interesting, a couple who are stretched for funds are offered a million dollars to press a button, and someone will die. They press it and then .... This first part. I have seen before in a twilight zone episode but what this movie does is continue this plot. Overall, I think the plot will keep you interested throughout. To me, it is a moral point at the end. A person has been killed, and his death should not go unpunished.The production itself is fairly cheap. There are no brilliant action scenes, the filming will not particularly impress you.Overall, I suggest you go watch it."
3,The plot Predictable The message true,The Box is ok. the plot is very predictable. The movie itself is sad but true. It is a true portrayal of all that is wrong with our society itself and why we are in the world of trouble we are.
1,TRASH,"Very bad acting with no plot and lots of repetition. Watch this at a friends house, preferably while having sex or a good time doing something else. Do not....repeat do not buy this flick."
3,"Great Shape, if-y movie","Was in good condition. The movie wasn't that great though. Though the seller doesn't have control over that. I read the description, and it sounded good. It wasn't but the shape of the movie was and it's not like they hyped up the story line."
1,Okay concept-- misstep in the execution,"The premise of this movie is intriguing, but should have been put into a 1 hour special or something. The story went on and on with scenes that made no sense (like they edited out the part that tied it all together or something!). The final ending was really predictable (part of it anyway)- I feel the director needed to either tie all these scenes together better or cut all the things out that didn't seem to contribute to the storyline. Very disappointed."
2,Predictable,"The Box was a disappointment. I was hoping for some surprises, but it turned out to be a relatively simple tale of people who do a bad thing to profit from it and eventually pay for it. Ho hum. Some of it seemed downright silly. The acting was okay, but nothing to write home about."
1,such a weak story,I don't want to spoil the story so I won't go into details but I will say the movie is intriguing at the onset but as the movie progresses it gets less and less interesting and more and more out of touch with reality. It's a pathetic attempt at being clever and falls way short of what I expected. I wish I could get the the two hours of my life back..
2,Wholly Unappealing Extended Twilight Zone Episode,"No one denies Richard Matheson's legacy - to writers, filmmakers and artists of all stripes. His works have altered entire categories of artistic endeavors - which is the hallmark for any truly gifted innovator/creator.But this production is a drawn out, despicable spit into the face of humanity - brought to life by auteur filmmaker Richard Kelly. And like Tim Burton or Zack Snyder - seems to have the excrementous ability to polarize audiences, usually between average film fans and the fanboys.Everyone pushes the button. Greed and self-interest overrides all. Final judgment to follow soon.Thank you for spending your money and time to watch this - please do come back next week for our Annual Holocaust Review & Discussion."
4,A surreal morality tale,"Arthur and Norma Lewis have a difficult but overall happy life, until the strange, disfigured Mr. Steward comes into it. He offers them a box with a button, and a briefcase with 1,000,000 dollars. All they have to do is push the button and the money is theirs, but someone, somewhere will die. Yes, they push the button, but that's when the real story begins. A fascinating, surreal, ethereal look at human morality, and an inventive twist on an old tale."
2,"Great atmosphere, bad movie...","I watched this many years ago as a Twilight Zone episode, and thought it was pretty cool. When I saw that they were making a movie, I thought to myself, ""how much more can they possibly add to this story?"" Well, the answer is nothing, really. None more black.Okay, just because you stuff a lot of existential crap in there and call it a morality play doesn't make it good. And the whole ""technology is magic"" thing is just a cop out way of saying, ""it doesn't make sense because it's beyond our comprehension."" Give me a break.The only thing I was able to take away from this movie is the overall feeling of dread it creates. Just a simple thing like having it set in the 70's, and the horrible wallpaper makes you feel uncomfortable. Then throw in some disfigurement, and the weird teenagers... the whole thing just makes you feel... wrong, dirty. So kudos for atmosphere, but overall, not an enjoyable experience for me."
2,I didn't quit get this one. (maybe spoiler),"I wanted to really like this movie but the further I got into it the less I understood and the worse my headache got. From what I can tell it all revolved around aliens and them using us to do experiments/tests. The scenes really jumped around, alot! It was hard to follow and at the end it left you wanting more of it to be explained, and wondering what else you could have done with hour and 90 minutes you just wasted watching this movie."
2,Not What I Expected!!!,"At first, the movie started off really well. I loved that it took place in the 70's, and around Christmas. It was toward the middle of the movie that it became confusing, and added supernatural references. I'm still not sure what Mr. Steward and his employees were supposed to be. I couldn't tell if they were aliens, or people under mind control. Norma and Arthur Lewis receive a black box with a red button on it. If they push it; they will receive a million dollars, and someone dies. Once the button is pushed, they must deal with the consequences. If you were given the opportunity for a million dollars, would you push the button on THE BOX!!!"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!,This movie is a complete waste of time. Do not buy it or rent. Save your time and money. The plot is awlful. Enough said!!!
2,started out okay and then fell apart,"This would have been better had it remained in the realm of planet Earth and conspiring humans instead of having to do with Mars or physics or Donnie Darko flashbacks on the part of the director. It darn near put me to sleep after a while, which should not have happened with a movie that began as a paranoid conspiracy suspense flick."
1,Director apparently couldn't add to the story to make it make sense,"Watched it and wasn't very impressed. It was taken from a 30 min or less 70's TV show called the Twilight Zone which dealt with weird and whacky short ideas/stories that writers came up with. How to take one of those short stories, that by definition of being short does not have a lot of background details or a significant ""plot"", and turn it into a hollywood movie? Well, the answer appears to be that this particular director could not. There were holes in the story and overall it just didn't make much sense.Give it a miss, you won't regret it."
1,Should have stayed a short story...,"This film has it all. Bad to terrible acting (with the exception being Frank Langella) by characters that are as unbelievable as they are inconsistent. The simple ""moral"" premise is drawn out with so many ridiculous twists and turns that the writer(s) must have been paid by the word. The only reason I watched to the end was to see what other convolutions they would throw in to make this silly movie seem like a thought provoking film. The premise and moral questions are sound, but it should have remained a short story..."
2,that's ok,movie movie movie movie movie that not good ok but good picture on tv that ok action in movies must more action.
3,"Button, Button.","The Box is based on a short story written by Richard Matheson, who also wrote many classic episodes of The Twilight Zone. Richard Kelley rewrote the short story and directed this rather confusing sci-fi flick. Kelley is the mastermind behind Donnie Darko, if you didn't enjoy that film - you probably won't like this then. The first hour is really good but the last hour, is just plain creepy. James Marsden feels out of place in this film but who really steals the show is Cameron Diaz. Diaz has always been a hit and miss for me, I thought she was brilliant in the chick-flick In Her Shoes. You wouldn't think Diaz could pull off such a meaty performance but she does and Frank Langella is also wonderful. The Box is just one of those films that doesn't make sense, it's eye-catching but not good enough to keep a viewer's interest for too long, what a shame!"
3,The Box.,"_The Box_ (2010) is a pretty gruesome film which starts from an interesting premise but I feel loses something towards the end. The film focuses on a family on the brink of financial disaster when they are visited by a strange man who is missing part of his face. The man offers the wife a diabolical proposition, she can choose to press a button which will result in the death of one person on the face of the earth but will be rewarded with 1 million dollars. The premise is interesting but I felt the movie gets lost after this point especially when it turns to aliens from NASA as an explanation for the mysterious man and his box. The film is overall fairly gruesome and diabolical in nature (taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others, etc.). I did not however feel that the ending was that good and it ends with a sad series of mishaps."
1,Save time and money and AVOID this movie,"The sad thing is this film had the potential to be good. It ends up ruining it with a horrible ending (without spoilers, some things are vaguely implied but it is basically a draw your own conclusion sort of ending). The story is also not developed properly; too many things are implied and not defined well enough to give you a sense of anything other that you just wasted 2 hours of your time when the movie is over. If you sat and watched the grass grow for two hours you would feel about the same as if you watched this movie. Not the worst thing you have ever seen but you definitely don't want to pay for it and there are a whole lot of better things to watch."
1,WTF?,Are you kidding me? This went from a pretty good storyline about moral values to some kind of bad X-Files science fiction movie; one that made no sense and left everything openended. Who are these people? How deep is the involvement of our government with them? This movie isn't even worth the money to rent it. Stay away.
4,The Price of Greed,"It seems to me the people who hate this movie don't get it. As if you shouldn't be punished for accepting a million dollars for someone else's life. I'm a huge fan of the SAW movies. If you like the premise of Saw, you'll most likely like this.There are things that don't make sense & I plan on watching it again some time & will probably be able to put more of the pieces together."
3,stimulating,"Any fusion of Arthur C. Clarke with Sartre is a multi-star ambition of itself. The plot may be too intricate for some, but the story is thought provoking with solid performance all around. An elaborate film, but worth the effort."
3,4 bucks was a litte too much to pay :-),"OK...OK...it wasn't really that bad but, it wasn't that good either.It's basically a thriller.Let's put it this way.Acting - 3 out of 5 starsPlot - 3 out of 5 stars1. The plot started off really slow...really slow.2. Still it really got interesting. I usually figure movies like this out right away and get bored.3. OK, so this brings us to the end. What in the world???? That's why I couldn't figure it out because it's nonsense.You constantly think - holy cow this is gonna get good.....and then....it ends. Kind of annoying.Special effects - 3 out of 5So, it was worth 4 bucks and the 2 hours just don't expect 4 or 5 stars."
1,"""The Box"" = a new level of bad","This movie started with promise, intrigue and dragged on like a root canal. The most pointless slow worst movie I have seen since Ravenous. STAY AWAY STAY VERY VERY FAR AWAY! And I like pretty bad movies too. THis one was too much"
2,"Terrible movie, bad story","I read what the movie was all about and I already figured... this can't be good.First of all: why would you even discuss to push the button if you can kill some one, if you would believe it?Second of all: why would you even consider to push the button if you don't believe it?That was my first thought and I had the same thought till the end. I did wish it would be different, though! I found it rubbish from the beginning till the end. And the end made it even worse and even more unrealistic (as far as that was even possible). Ofcourse I can't tell the plot, but if you've seen it and think about it... this didn't help either, did it?I saw the movie for free on tv and I wouldn't spend any money on it."
1,Awful Movie.....SAVE YOUR $$$$$,"This move was udderly stupid and waste of time.Do yourself a favor and go try to get a traffic ticket, that would be more worthwhile than watching this.This ranks with MARS ATTACKS movie which until now I thought was the worst movie ever made.Cameron Diaz also needed to fire her makeup artist.The 70's decor alone almost had me puking.The movie plot was based in VA. but what was up with the accents they made the actors use, Virginan's don't talk like hicks. Hollywood was way off on this one.I can't wait for Jay Leno to get a hold of this one."
1,BAD,"Where should I start? Oh yes, BAD.BAD casting.BAD plot.BAD acting.BAD wallpaper.BAD Hair.BAD movie."
1,Awful!,I would give this half a star if I could. Why did they even make this? Why would you answer the door to a strange man carrying a box? The plot is weak and the acting horrid. Couldn't they at least attempt a semi-decent piece of work? I'm assuming they were able to at least imagine how a good movie would go.
2,INTERESTING PREMISE! POORLY EXECUTED!,"I had really high hopes for this film and that could have been part of my disappointment with it. I loved the premise and this is the kind of film that would normally pull me in, but I found the performances bland and the execution poor. I caught myself checking my watch to see how much time was left too many times. I think it's worth 2 1/2 stars, but it is a very forgettable movie that I doubt I would ever watch again."
2,1980's Twilight Zone episode was Better,"As a self proclaimed nerd, I've watched the new Twilight Zone (or the 80s) series and the original Rod Serling series. (nothing beat the original version.)That said, this movie was originally a 1/2 long vignette entitled ""Button Button"" from the 1980's Twilight Zone starring Brad Davis (Midnight Express) and Mare Winningham.I really enjoy James Marsden, Frank Langella and Cameron Diaz, but honestly, trying to make a 1/2 skit into a full length movie was a waste of time.Don't bother to purchase it, rent it. Then watch the Twilight Zone version."
1,115 minutes I'll never get back,"This movie was frustratingly dull and confusing. It's a mess of conspiracy theory, psychological thriller, aliens/paranormal movie, Biblical fable, mind control, politics. Who's the villain? The government? Extraterrestrials? People with paranormal abilities? A corporation? Who knows? The pace plods along with lots of little scenes strung-together that go nowhere. The movie raises tons of story questions (why this couple, why 1976, how does the box work, why are there 2 portals to eternal damnation, who are the employers, and on and on and on) but by the end, answers NONE of them. ""The Ring"" was as bad, but at least it was visually interesting. This movie doesn't even have that going for it. As for the cast, Diaz looks tired, Marsden looks lost, and Langella looks bored. So was I. But at least *he* got a paycheck out of it."
2,Abysmal...worst adaptation EVER of a Richard Matheson work,"Based on an excellent short story, this one gets the Raspberry Award for worst adaptation. Matheson has been incredibly lucky over the years in that he has inspired some amazing adaptations . . . which, in my opinion, points to the strength of the source material. I went in with high hopes with ""The Box"" given the strong cast, but this one is a Class-A stinker, something way less than the sum of its parts. It's unfortunate."
2,No features,"No... I did not buy this. I always netflix movies that are borderline interesting for me to see if its worth buying.I liked the movie for what its worth. I may be mistaken but there was an episode on one of the twilight zone reincarnations devoted to this storyline.But everyone has their own taste and this was ok for me.What irked me was that there was not 1 feature on this disc. This is a bluray.No featurette, no commentary, no deleted scenes, no nothing. Nada. Zilch.Why? Charging 25 bucks or so for JUST a movie and a mediocre one at best?Now that is truly insulting to the public.Rent it... Don't buy it.UPDATE: I just read in the product description that there are features. Well I couldn't find them. The menu had 2 options: Play and Languages."
2,The Box,"A couple is awaken early in the morning and find a box on their doorstep, but no one is around. The box contains a box with a button on it, if they push it someone they do not know dies and they recieve a million dollars cash. A series of finical problems make them push the button, which is set up nicely. They see the box is nothing more then a wooden prop, no wires to say if they pushed it or not. They press the button and weird stuff starts to happen to them. The movie was going alright, nothing too great, but still enjoyable. However, the movie takes a weird turn and the movie just starts to sucks. It's too bad they couldnt keep the plot going because it could have been a good movie but the ending was stupid."
1,Another religious theme sci-fi flop,"I was going to give thi film a very bad review but I decide not to hurt the feeling of the idiots who made it so only giving it a bad review. If there was anything good about it it must have been during the time when I fell aleep. The story, theme, acting , photography, producing and directing must have been by a group of over zealous christian evangelists. Bits and pieces were borrowed from other sci-fi movies. I hope the people who were involved in making this movie have a second career lined up. Maybe they could get work sweeping streets for Mr. Warner. Did they really get enough money in their church collection plates to finanve this trashy movie?"
2,"""Where did all this water come from?""","Hilarious! This is a so-bad-it's-good classic. Lags in the middle, has an almost touching moment late, but this movie is pretty much LOL all the way. Astonishingly bad writing - enjoy!"
2,not interesting,"this movie started out very good.. but in the middle, it veered off to something else.. then caught back up in the end.. i did not like the way they were tricked into the box.. of course they could have said no, to activating.. but they were not told what else would happen.. and all the kids were left without parents.. bad movie.."
3,"Entertaining film, better than the average garbage coming out of Hollywood","This is not a bad movie for rental, but I wouldn't buy it. I thought it was creative and entertaining, and all so reminiscent of own personal decisions made. I think anyone can relate.It throws out the same rhetorical human question as the movie ""the abyss"", but without Ed Harris to intercede on our behalf (no Christ-like parallel in this film)."
4,Olurum Sana....the title says it all!,"From the moment I first heard this music, I couldn't sit still anymore... But besides the danceable numbers, also listen to the romantic ones. Although I can't understand every single word (my Turkish boyfriend is always willing to translate)...the message comes across !"
4,Definitely worth a UK release - but don't translate it!,"My partner Jane and I first heard this album on a gulet holiday in July 99, where it was played most evenings - so by the end we could sing most of the songs without the album. We were tempted to buy it there but resisted, only to hear Simarik on London Capital Radio a few weeks later (albeit transmitted over a mobile phone - it's a long story). I then ordered it from Amazon.We were hooked by this album's blend of Turkish rhythm, phrasing and orchestration with a very western pop production style. Fortunately, Tarkan does not suffer from the Eurovision overacting syndrome but has a powerful and expressive voice.I am sure this disc could break into UK mainstream but they would probably have to do an English version - a shame. Try it for yourself."
4,Better then the average but not up to par with his previous,Typical Tarkan album filled with Turkish ryhthm and emotion. Some songs makes you weep where as others makes you jump!Most of my American friends find it very tasteful
5,EVERY SONG IS DONE EXCELLENT\,I saw Tarkan's music video on euro MTV while visiting in Germany this month. I bought the album and am very pleased that every song on it is wonderful.My favorite is Don Bebgim & Olurum Sana.
1,Poor choice,on my part. Don't know what I was expecting or why I even purchased this DVD. Disappointing is too high a rating.
2,Good to see Christian perspective but...,It was good to see a Christian perspective that the news doesn't give but the video is drawn out and not very encouraging. You don't walkaway seeing God's hand in the lives of those on the video just devastation and even the cross that is found doesn't do much for them. Sorry to be negative but I wouldn't recommend it.
5,"A Funny, moving Christian film about following",your prayers and other biblical lessons in modern life.
5,Wow,"This cd should be number 1. Their voices are more than great. Good condition and sound. Wish I would have got it years ago, yet I'm glad I own it. Thanks"
4,This is a nice album,"I bought this album after I saw the video for ""Only Love"" (great song), and I was certainly not disappointed. Though Toni does have a richer voice, I think Trina, Tamar, and Towanda hold their own very nicely. My favorites are ""Where's the Good in Goodbye?"", ""The Boss"", ""Only Love"", ""What Does It Take""...heck! I love the whole album. Why am I trying to choose my favorite tracks? They all rock! I hope they put together another album because I'll definitely buy it!"
1,Avoid at any cost!,"What a bluffing! This is a completely disappointing album. Mrs. Salmaso is a limited Brazilian folk-singer with a small vocal range, no expressiveness, and backed by a very bad band. The arrangements are poor, nothing that could be compared to the work of great Brazilian arrangers like Gaya, Lyrio Panicalli, Leo Perachi or even Eumir Deodato. Brazilian music doesn't moves forward through Salmaso's hands (and terrible voice). It moves back! it's not a progression, it's really a retrogression.It's one of the worst albums released in the Nineties. Avoid at any cost!"
3,web cam,This product is good and cheap.It is also easy to use.But u have to wait for long time to get moneyback.I have not recevied yet.
2,Not a worthy product,"First of all driver for this product is very difficult to install. Secondly, the product performance itself is not very smooth. Around the same price, you can get a better web cam."
2,Not satisfied,"I bought this webcam of creative but its performance is notsatisfied at all, when i use this webcam for chatting on messenger it doesnt give clarity and picture looks dull."
1,Bad,Its not good. It breaks up. Bad transmission. Please dont buy this webcam. Its dissapointing!!! :(Creative rebates are a hoax. They mail me a post card and say the UPC bar code does not match.
3,"Not for Vista! OK on XP, Marginal Picture Quality","There are much better available, avoid this ""Creative Webcam"" unless you are getting it cheap and are only installing it on an XP PC. It does not work on Vista.It did install fairly quickly on my XP PCs (we have 3 of these webcams) and performs well enough for video chatting. The picture quality is just OK, nothing special. The included software is also OK and does what you expect it to do.Not recommended."
3,Good buy!,"Used this product for the past 2 years without any issues. I got it for $25 then. Its no good for desktop PCs, but a great buy for laptops. The video quality is very decent."
3,"Good webcam, poor software",This webcam is good for anyone who wants to skype or IM with video. The resolution is okay and the webcam works pretty well even in poor lighting. The only downside to this product is the software that comes with it. I couldn't get the software to run on my computer even when plugged into the USB 2.0 ports at the back. The software looks nifty but is slow.
4,Working Great !!!!!,"I have been using it for like month now. And it is working great. Online video chat or creating videos, just great."
5,awesome resolution,"i have a notebook webcam from creative. i love it because it's so small that it fits on top of the screen and the resolution is very good. but this new product is better in terms of resolution. awesome quality with respect to a webcam. it has got the advantage that it can be used both with desktop and laptop (mine only fits with a laptop). if you have both types of computer, buy this one. creative deserves credit. i paid amazon $25.54 (which included S&H)."
5,Great Camera,This camera works perfectly for windows xp as well as Windows XP x64 and has some nice software included. Also the image quality is great and setup is very simple.
1,POS,"I second the first reviewer's opinion. This is a total piece of sh*t. First I had trouble getting it to work on my WinXP desktop. After a couple reboots it finally worked, and the image quality was a total joke, even in the webcam capacity. The video quality was visibly worse than my 5-year-old Logitech webcam which had cost me about the same amount at CompUSA five years ago. In the end I returned this POS and will keep using my Logitech until it dies."
1,Total shite,I can't believe how generous other reviewers have been in assessing this cam's awful performance. The images are sooooooooo blurry and dull - maybe it works better in very bright light but for normal lighting conditions forget it. I have a 5 year old Intel web cam that works a milion times better than this piece of junk. Some friends of mine in the Philippines just bought a cam from A4Tech for about $15 equivalent and that produces a very nice picture so there is no way one can put this cam's abysmal performance down to low price. Please don't waste your time or money with this terrible cam. I would really have liked to have awarded it no stars whatsoever.
2,Works well but the holding clasp very fragile,worked well but then the one of the clasp broke. so cannot hold on to the screen and hence now useless to methe clasp joint is very fragilenot a good purchase !!
3,Capitalism:A Treatise on Economics,"One grevious error: If he beleives that Capitalist will help raise the average workers wages etc (and that includes health care if its your standard of living)all indications from the census to IRS reports wages have been on a gradual decline. Wealth doesn't trickle down. And if minimum wages are abolished more then 51% of Americans will make under $26,000.00 a year.Capitalists are becoming altruistic. But other then that he made interesting points of view, in his opinion."
4,Useful for students and clinicians alike.,"Dr. Tilley has again provided a helpful reference for Small Animal Cardiology that can also fit into a lab coat pocket. Not only is this a valuable source of information for students in clinics and for exam review, but also a quick reference for busy clinicians. Obviously EKG is only a part of a thorough cardiac evaluation, but it is often an important and underrated diagnostic tool. And for those of us who cannot always find a bic pen (vets will understand) when we need one, including a EKG ruler was a great touch! I strongly recommend this to any veterinarian interested in improving his/her EKG reading skills."
5,More to this book than meets the eye,"I originally loved this book as a child; it was the very first book that I basically memorized, and was instrumental in my learning how to read. I bought it used here as an adult so I could read it to my kids. They both loved it as well. Certainly there are outdated attitudes in it, but I think that's a good thing: a jumping-off point for discussion about (for example) whether an animal can truly be good or bad, and what we mean by ""anthropomorphic.""There's also some fascinating subliminal stuff lurking just beneath the text and pictures. Check out this blogger's review for details: [...]"
2,Does not do the job!,"The product is a four USB hub however, for USB flash drives, which is what I got it for, it does not work: you can put ONE drive in the top row and ONE in the bottom, if you try to put them side-by-side they do not fit - the ports are too close together. So in fact - functionally - it is not really a four USB hub but only a tow USB hub for the price of four...:-("
4,Works fine,"It does have a short cord, but long enough to reach the front of an older desktop computer with USB 1.1 connections only on the back. Short cord could be a plus for laptops: Less tangling."
5,Caution,"The Mini-Hub worked without a hitch, and seems robust. Just be sure the short cord is not a problem for you."
3,usb review,its ok it does the job but has very little flexibility you can't move it around very far.
5,"Great live, great cd.","I just discovered Babbie 1/10/04 when she came to North Metro church in Marietta to participate in a benefit concert with Mac Powell (of Third Day), Todd Fields (Worship leader at Northpointe Community Church in Alpharetta, GA which is led by Andy Stanley, son of Charles Stanley), Kenn Kington and the Pat Terry Group (very big in Christian music in the 70's - legendary pioneers of Christian Rock). To say she has an amazing voice would not really do her justice. She has a presence about her when she performs that says ""I'm totally at ease"". It's important to point that out as that comes through in all of her songs on this cd. She'll lead you to lift up the Lord and let you sing along and praise the Lord at the same time. On this particular recording she's singing live so you'll be able to enjoy the passion that she sings with live. This cd is worth the money."
4,GREAT SUMMERTIME FEELGOOD HOUSE!,ENJOY ALL THE MIXES OF THIS IBIZA CLASSIC...PERFECT FOR THOSE HOT SUMMER NIGHTS AND MOJITOS...TIM DELUXE TURNS IN A TOUGH TERRACE MIX...
5,Passport USA - Excellent Book,Excellent book for people new to the United States. Faster read than similar books like Culture Shock and to the point. Offers information on a variety of topics that is very easy to understand and put into practice.
4,Stop wearing down your vinyl.,"If you're not familiar with the Nip Drivers, they played punk rock that blended So. Cal. punk with an updated pop punk feel, although they preceeded pop punk by many years. Imagine a snottier Descendents, who were a contemporary of the Nip Drivers. This disc compiles their 2 LPs and a couple compilation tracks. There are a couple missing 7""s from this CD, but this is their best stuff. The Destroy Whitey 12"" showcases their more raw, faster stuff and the ""Oh Blessed Freakshow"" LP shows their more diverse and poppy side, with a great cover of ""Rio"". If you want to supplement your vinyl, never tracked these LPs down, or want to familiarize yourself with early California punk, you should pick this up."
5,RIP Mike Weber,"Classic 80's SoCal punk/HC, loud, fast and dripping with attitude and humor. A truly under-rated band that sort of fell through the cracks and didn't get as much attention as other bands from that time and scene.The mastering on this CD is a little quiet, but overall the sound is decent. It's pretty difficult to find the original vinyl of ""Destroy Whitey"" and ""Blessed Freak Show,"" so this CD is a good buy."
1,Very poor reproduction of musical examples,The book is a facsimile reproduction of a 1920's edition. The reproduction is so poor that the musical examples are virtually illegible. The illustrations are also of very poor quality.
5,The Best Book that I have cracked to take a peak at.,I would like to perform 100% of these sexual activities this my future soul mate to equalize my blessing a year or so later. I have the male sexual drive in order to score big.
2,My thoughts,I bought the book thinking my husband and I were going to start having some great sex in new positions and having a great time (not that we didn't have great sex). But instead we were both disappointed that a lot of the positions were too difficult or boring. We both agreed that it needs more action and less posing.
5,Best Wedding Gift Ever!!!,"If your married, you need this book! I have given it to many friends for a wedding gift and each couple keeps coming back to thank me for this wonderful book. I think if everyone had this common-sense manual our divorce rate would probably drop significantly.It helps allieviate much of the stress in this area of relationships, and most men I know appreciate the ""tasteful"" photos. Thanks Anne Hooper for giving me the ""Best Wedding Gift"" I have ever given. Jim Bucholtz-Charlotte, NC"
2,"Promising too much, giving too little","I was quite disappointed with the book. Coming from a professional I would have expected more information about some issues. The information provided is accurate, but I found the book superficial, so you might be interested in using it as a first step, but you'll be interested in something more, as soon as you finish reading it."
1,I could have written this myself,"This is the basics. The very basics. If talking to your partner is difficult for you, or if you have very little experience this book might be OK for your needs. If your looking for the ""ulitmate"" sex book, something new to add to your sexual skills, do not buy this book."
2,Not for us at all,"My husband and I were very disappointed with this book when it arrived. The books focuses on the stories of other couples (which totally didn't involve us, not even remotely) and it has a lot of suggestions that are just entirely not our thing. Also, the books seems to think that the only way for a woman to achieve orgasm is through self-stimulation, and we don't agree with that...the only reason we have this book two stars (as opposed to one) are for the different positions they show you...that was the only helpful part for us. Otherwise, this book was a waste of time and money (we are sending it in for a refund)...if you are a Christian, I suggest NOT buying this book and instead purchasing ""Intended for Pleasure"" by Dr. Ed Wheat, who writes from a CHRISTIAN view. There are a lot of un-christian views in this book...but ""Intended for Pleasure"" is completely moral and helpful."
3,Not the best thing I ever watched,"OK, there is some good music here. However, the attempt to drag their daughter Chastity into these specials kind of distracts from the program. There are a few fun bits on the program but I don't believe some of the ""spontanious banter"" is as spontanious as advertised. Still, it is a fun show from the days before militant athiests used the ACLU as a club."
2,Sonny & Cher Christmas Collection,"This is something I would only watch once. It was too repitious. Nice to see something from the past, but once is enough."
1,SONNY AND CHER THE CHRISTMAS COLLECTION,3 OF THE SAME TYPE CHRISTMAS SHOWS FROM 3 DIFFERNT YEARS? SOME HUMOR I WAS A CHILD WHEN THSES ORIGINALLY AIRED AND THOUGHT I would watch them as an adult. Now I am wondering how these 2 every got a show the entertainment was slow at times and poor acting no thought skits. Would only recommend if you are very bored in life and have saw most every movie made.
3,"Very Corny, but still Nostalgic","I remembered these two being much less corny than they appear now, but the music was great. I didn't care for the ""Sonny's Pizza"" skit in each of the three episodes, as they seemed to go on forever and weren't very funny. They also must have recorded the episodes live because the stumbling over words and long pauses are all in tact. But the elderly people I care for (in their 90's) seemed to like the episodes just fine and thanked me for playing them. At least it was in color and the costumes were very entertaining."
4,"Hilarious Must buy, find right price","I have bought 6 seasons of this show and they are all great, just find the right price i have paid from $6 to 15 dollars all were worth 15."
5,Great,This is the best album I have in the spirit of Irish pub or Drinking songs. I recomend this with all my heart being I am part Irish!!!
3,"luddites...good, neo-luddites...bad","This is a great book for anyone learning about the Luddites, however, the author is extremely bias so other books might be needed to get the whole picture. as for the later part of the book. the author have trouble tying the Luddites to his argument(philosophy of Neo-Luddites.) easy read, story like telling of the history of Luddites."
5,"provocative, good!","Excellent, provocative work. Calls into question the whole progressivist paradigm of Western Liberal thought...definite good lesson to all those with naively sunny visions of the .com future...Strongly recommend Mark Lutz & Kenneth Lutz if you liked this book."
1,Terrible!,"Don't waste your money! There are good books on this worthy subject but this one is very bad. It's poorly written, pompous in tone, yet full of lame assumptions any college student could see beyond. The few good ideas are not the author's own, though he rarely gives credit where credit is due. It's as if it was written in one sitting, by a not very intelligent person who had done little reading on the subject and didn't have much respect for ideas. I don't usually bother writing bad reviews but politically I'm on the same side as Sale on many of these issues and he makes an embarrassing, sophomoric mess of them."
2,Another Disappointing movie for Cuba Gooding Jr,"This movie had a lot of opportunity, if done well, which it was not.This wasn't possible the worse idea for a cop movie, if it was handle well it could had been a eye-opener to what cops can get away with. But it was poorly down, like in scenes where Cuba feels up a young girl. It should be a very serious and disturbing look at what his character does but it just looked like a joke done very stupidly.Cuba Gooding Jr is a truly brilliant actor, why would he play this character. I mean if their was good dialogue, and he didn't play the role so over the top street but more serious, evil, bad and not stupid he could have been a great character. The movie it self had a lot of downs near the end I thought maybe something but it just got worse.We can only cross are fingers and hope Cuba career and choice in movies stop declining, For example he is a much better actor than Vin Diesel but who's movies are bigger."
5,Fun to watch with great characters,If you don't like dark movies don't watch this one. Cuba andhis partner are very true to form and interact with with reallife situations. It deserves a higher rating that its being given.
3,;0/,"Lol it's like the left over of the movie Training Day. It's not bad but too many similarites of the other movie the 2 cops one badish one with a brain, and so on and so on and so on. It was ok not bad but since I was always thinking about Training day I didn't get to get into it as much. Its a time paster."
3,Tombstone eyes,"When the line between the cops and the drug dealing gangs blurs,two cops have a fatal encounter with their results of their misdeeds.One cops kills an innocent old man, the other molests innocentcivilians. They both get caught up in a dirty deal..."
1,Cuba dissapoints his fans,"As the previous review stated, Cuba attempts to compete with ""Training Day"" and fails horribly. The plot is lacking, there is poor character development and excessive profanity. I would have given this movie less stars if it were possible. Save your money."
3,Poor Transfer to DVD,"I was looking forward to seeing this in full, having only previously seen clips on TV. However, whoever was in charge of running the projector didn't bother to check the sound connections, so the resulting sound on the DVD only came from the left speaker. The incidental music for the menu came through both speakers, so it wasn't my system at fault."
5,Delicious,"I bought this for a family member's birthday, who is obsessed with Pocky. He loved it; the different types allowing him to choose his favorite, and ask me for more. The quality of the product was wonderful, just as if you were getting it straight from Japan."
2,Glico Collection- Overpriced and Not What I Expected,"I bought this Glico Collection to try out other unusual flavors of Pocky and other related products. I received what is available in their current stock:2 2.82 oz Glico Chocolate Pocky3 1.16 oz Glico Strawberry Pocky1 1.16 Sweet Milk Pocky1 3.53 oz. Chocolate Almond Crush Pocky1 Glico Coconut Chocolate Pocky1 Toppo Cocoa Sticks 2.5 oz.1 Glico Roasted Pretz 2.46 oz.1 Glico Corn Pretz 2.46 oz1 Glico Salad Pretz 2.46 oz.1 Hello Kitty Strawberry Chocolate Sticks1 Orange Hi-chewI've tried the Sweet Milk-- it was OK and tasted like condensed milk dipped sticks.My favorite is the Chocolate Almond Crush- very addicting, chocolatey and nutty.Strawberry is good too.I wish I bought my own mix from another online store. This Glico pack is not worth it as I can buy the other varieties cheaper at an Asian supermarket that are well stocked with Pocky coming from regional Glico Pocky flavors."
2,Pocky is good but..,"Best to check out your local Asian food market or Japanse anime store. The price will usually be better, considering S&H;, and you won't be stuck with 6x of something you end up hating. Also there are a lot of other varieties of pocky than what's being sold here. There's even ""giant"" pocky, ""custard"" pocky, ""green tea"" etc... Always more new ones coming out.But, if there are no market or if other internet stores are comparable in price, than maybe a wise choice for the curious snacker. Beware though, even I didn't like the sesame. And FYI, Men's pocky is just ""bitter"" instead of ""milk"" chocolate. Best flavors in my opinion (and most novice Pocky snackers like): Men's, Strawberry with/without extra bits, almond crush."
4,Fun,"We used these on a group vacation. It was fun to pick a label and also keep track of your drink. We would just wear them on our wrist in between beverages. They are very durable however the words did wear off. We used them on cans, cups and bottles."
5,The Bottom Line on PEOPLE POWER is your Bottom Line,"I'm an IS Professional, more at home with computer networks than people networks. I've always put my faith in hard facts and quick answers. Reading Donna's book taught me that my relationships with people were more important than the work I performed for them.I learned that networking is not a strategy but a Lifestyle. It was fun to read and full of special sections I used to apply each Power Principle. I used the questions in the ""Pause"" sections to develop a daily networking action plan. It helped double my active client list in just six months.This book reminds us that we need to give before we can receive. Give this book to yourself today so you can receive the benefits immediately!My Favorite Quote: ""The truth is that the more high-tech we get, the more high touch we'll require."""
3,Too Good or Too Bad?,"Suzanne Devlin is staying with the Wakefields.She is beautiful and seems very nice.In fact the whole town practically worships her.They think she is Christmas,Thanksgiving and the turkey all dressed up.The truth is that Suzanne is an evil little deviant who hates everyone in the little town.In fact,she is going to set out to ruin somebody's life.Will anyone find out the truth about devillish Devlin before a life is destroyed by lies??"
1,too small,The large order came as a glove labeled M//L and obviously were too small. I am 6 feet tall 180 and do not have abnormally large hands :)
4,Excellent!,"I love this album. He does sound a bit like Morrissey and Damon Albarn at times, but that's just a singing style. Damon Albarn and Morrissey sound like each other sometimes too.Anyway, I love the variety of songs that show up here and especially enjoy all the short bursts of electric piano and saxophone. I wouldn't have expected that they way the album started out.Anyway, phooey to the naysayers...just as the record desciption says, if you like Morrissey, the Smiths, Blur, or B&S;, definitely pick this up."
4,no mere Smiths tribute band,"Thoroughly entertaining record that touches on influences ranging from the Smiths to French pop to almost spacy rock music. My favourite songs are the swirly-guitar first single ""Lost in the Plot"", the obviously Smiths-influenced ""Don't Lose the Faith"", and the Gainsbourg-ish ""22: The Days of All the Romance""(my favourite song of the CD). The band is even better live!"
2,bla,"there's a reason morrisey picked them to play with him, actually 2 reasons. 1)he's an overrated, egotistical artist 2)they sound like him and , coincidentally, are extremely overrated also."
3,This is a low.,"I really want to love this record with 4.5 stars. It has a romantisism that I like and admire from the best Brit-pop of the past decade. I just cannot get over this guy's voice. Holy Albarn, would someone pass the starshaped beetlebums. I love Blur (sounds like someone else does too) and it's hard to get past the similarities. Nonetheless I still need to point out that the creativity and breadth of style and dynamic on this makes the Damonomics worth overlooking. Some really nice songs here."
1,one kindy catchy song,i kindy liked I&I but that's about it.she was wack when she was on Prince's Paisley Park and she still can't sing.as Much as I respect&enjoy the genius of Nile Rodgers he can't rescue her poor vocals.
5,Catchy rifs-Beautiful voice,"Taja with her 2nd album comes out swinging! There is not a dull track on the album. (produced by Nile Rodgers, RJ Rice, and Taja Sevelle) If you like Texas, Paula Cole, Cardigans: you'll really enjoy Taja Sevelle!"
2,"It's ok, not like what I expected","I remember when Teja first came out and I had hopes of hearing more from her on the radio and such, I never had the opportunity to hear her first 2 cd's but I took the other's reviews into consideration when I purchased the CD and found that they were half right --- very different, dark and poetic but it lacked the ""jazzy"" or ""hip hop"" beats that the others suggested.Its only 1 cent ... I'd save it for your thoughts."
3,Manos: The Hands of Pain,"Don't get me wrong, I love MST3K, but watching Manos was one of the longest hours in my life. Even though the robots are great, as always, the movie overall is just plain sad, even Dr. Forrester apologized for making them watch such a horrible flick.So, if you are into masochism, be my guest, or if you really want to piss someone off, go with this...otherwise, steer clear."
5,I almost died laughing,"Oh my god this is one funny movie. I've grown up with Mystery Science Theater, my father introducing it to my brothers and I at a very young age. Its so bad that we ourselves can't make it through even a decent movie without some helpful comments of our own. Of all the episodes I have been exposed to over the years this is the absolute funniest!!! The movie is soooo bad...the first time you see it you really don't have any clue what is going on....but the bots make it so funny that it doesn't really matter what is really going on...all you know is that you are enjoying yourself. And that is the ultimate point of entertainment...Is it not?"
4,Joel and the Robots crack me up!,"Thank god for MST3K! How else could anyone sit through the monstrosity that is Manos: The Hands of Fate? The movie is poorly dubbed over using only four voices, and as the robots point out, the camera often dissolves to the same scene. But the wisecracks and remarks from Joel, Servo, and Crow caused me to to laugh nonstop throughout the movie. You'll also enjoy the short entitled ""Hired: Part II."" Can you believe that somebody actually had to sit down and watch Manos before it could be presented in MST3K form? Oh, the humanity!"
4,THIS is why MST3K was made!,"I realize that there is a short before this film, but I have forgotten it. In fact I have forgotten almost everything about this film. Except that it was long. It was long and stupid. It was long, stupid and quite pointless.Yes, I know that most MST3K movies are made with the hopes that Joel and ""the bots"" can salvage it. But THIS film....well, it is beyond ALL hope. It starts off like a college film class project, a family driving. And driving. And driving. And then getting lost. (And what's up with the ""kissing couple"", is THIS their occupation?)Torgo (Mr nelson) makes his debut performance and only the fact that many other times will Torgo appear, only this allows you to watch this film.It is bad. It oozes badness. The opening scene goes on for what seems, 16 hours. And THEN the film starts!!!]I hate this movie. But I thank Joel and the bots for getting me thru it. This is truly one of the WORST movies ever made!"
5,Horrible and Hilarious,"This is the worst movie MST3K took on, with the possible exception of Red Zone Cuba. Torgo lives!"
3,MST3K,"Why did they ever review this movie? Oh it is terrible...manos is edited poorly, bad lighting, blury images, terrible audio....and don't let me get started on the plot....ans yet, some how joel and the 'bots live through it...i, however, almost didn't."
3,Just too bad,"With all due respect to Joel and the 'bots, no force in heaven or earth could have made this movie bearable. You've got to appreciate their valiant effort, but they really never had a chance. There are shots of cornfields (and nothing else) that last like five minutes. When the action is that slow, there's just not a lot to work with. The plot makes so little sense that they can't even cling to anything long enough to pick it apart. The dialog is not just bad, but hopelessly repetitive, so they can't even come up with very many jokes about it. Bottom line, you're better off with ""Mitchell."""
2,"For the love of God, spare yourself!","I love MST3K. They are the funniest thing ever to hit TV (with the possible exeption of Monty Python). That said, Manos was just too terrible for them to save. This was pain. This was dullness brought to a new level. The only ray of light was the bit where Joel and the bots talk about whether Torgo (of the large knees) is a monster or not, and Tom ends up saying if he could have one body part enlarged, he would have one giant pinky he would drag behind him. I think the crew were so aghast at the sheer awfulness of this movie they were rendered nearly speechless. Spare yourself, watch Creeping Terror instead."
5,The Travel Brochure for Hell,"If I ever came across this movie without Joel and the Bots I would probably hurl chunks. Why would any movie studio distribute something like this? Torgo, ah yes, sweet gentle Torgo, how we loved him...well actually we hated him but he was so ridiculously stoned we had to love him."
4,MOAN!,"This is, along with ""Meet the Feebles"", ""Forbidden Zone"" and ""Dr. Caligari"" (the bizarre '80's art film, not the silent film classic ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari""), among the worst films EVER made!Even our dear crew on the Satellite of Love is agog and aghast at this cinematic horror. The jokes and jibes are hilarious as usual, but it's just as fun watching Joel, Crow and Tom recoil in horror from this Z-grade film.Only for the stout of heart and strong of stomach."
3,Torgo Rocks........The Master Will Be Pleased,"""Manos"" the hands of Fate is the worst movie to ever exist and you never want to watch it alone. It is so terrible that the two main villians are so lame. There is Torgo who has really big knees and likes to peep into windows and then there's the Master who is supposed to be satan or something. He like to wear a rob with very big hands on it. (...) This is one of my favorite episodes so bought the DVD of it. I think the quality of the DVD could be better but as far as the movie itself, it is worth a peek. I only wish Rhino would release Attack of the Eye Creatures. My tape of that one is getting worn out."
4,MST3K Rules! Just Not This Episode,"Joel and the Bots are great but the movie is so bad, they can't even really save this film. For some reason, this movie is so bad that it's actually boring. I hate to say that since I'm such a huge fan of MST3K. I still recommend getting this, but I thought that this was probably the worst commentary out of the episodes, but the in between skits were still great."
4,Dark days on the satellite.,"As many already know, the purpose of Mystery Science Theater 3000 is to take a very bad movie, watch it and make fun of it until the cows come home. I've been an avid fan of the series for years now, and I've watched all the Sci-Fi era episodes and more besides. I sat through Hamlet, Final Justice, Invasion of the Neptune Men and Gozilla Vs. Megalon, to name only a few. Not only did I sit through them, I enjoyed them.But Manos was still like being smacked across the face.Like always, the boys manage to do their absolute best, and it's definitely funny, but it's just not as good as the typical episode, not because the movie is bad, but because the untiring repitition and blank silences make it very tough to MST. Joel and the bots were obviously struggling with this one, and I found it a struggle too, but there are still good laughs to be had by all. If at all possible, find a way to watch this before purchase."
3,"Oh, MAN! The Worst Ever!!!","I've just this minute finished seeing this movie, and it is without a doubt the worst I've ever seen! The shoddy production values make ""Eegah"" look like ""Ben-Hur"", the movie is badly framed, badly lit, and almost always out of focus. The acting is so bad, it is beyond laughable. The only reason I give it three stars is because of the truly heroic efforts on the part of Joel & the 'bots to make this movie anything like bearable. You know it has to be bad if even Dr. Forrester and Frank apologize!Tragically, John Reynolds, whose performance as Torgo was the film's standout, committed suicide the same year this movie was made. (True story...)"
5,One of their finest,"Even before viewing Manos: Hands of fate (Manos is Spanish for Hands....thus HANDS: HANDS OF FATE!) I knew this was going to be a BAD film. I was correct in my assumptions, this movie was aweful...yet Joel and the gang managed to weave this turd into one of the finest MST3k's that I've had the pleasure to watch.The plot flows like cold honey until it seems like even the director got bored....I honestly can't get my brain to remember the whole story line, but needless to say it's unimportant. I whole-heartedly suggest this video to your collection!"
3,Oh My God,"The fact that human beings ever got together and said, ""Hey this is a great idea, let's make this movie,"" is the really scary part of this film. This one is so bad that it was tough to follow anything that was going on. To make matters worse, it was a bit creepy. I felt like I was watching a home movie of some malevolent cult."
5,The Best episode of MST3K there is.,"This movie, is just awful without Joel and the bots. I hope none of you ever have to sit through it. But , with them, I rolled on the floor laughing. Literally. I thought I was tripping , I laughed so hard. Torgo is the greatest non-monster, monster ever. They guys turn him into a drunken pleeb at a frat party, which is right where he belongs. I really believe that the sole purpose for making this movie, was so the director could revel in the (20 minute !!!) catfight. Any MST3K fan who hasn't seen this, you must run out now, RIGHT NOW, and buy it."
5,ONE OF THE BEST!!!!,"One of the best of the Joel Robinson episodes. You will laugh until you cry, especially at the hysterical short at the beginning of the show. And the nightgown wrestling sequence would be hilarious even without any commentary. I must admit, I've never seen a film where the actors repeat lines over and over so much (""The man, yes; the child, no!"" ; ""The damn car won't start!"")"
2,"For the love of God, spare yourself!","I love MST3K. They are the funniest thing ever to hit TV (with the possible exeption of Monty Python). That said, Manos was just too terrible for them to save. This was pain. This was dullness brought to a new level. I think the crew were so aghast at the sheer awfulness of this movie they were rendered nearly speechless. Spare yourself, watch Creeping Terror instead."
5,One of the Best of the Worst,"What could be the worst movie ever made is one of the funniest of the released MSTies. ""Manos"" is awful and repellant that it approaches art.It is so confusing it becomes surrreal. While not as bad as Monster A go-go, it definitley is...bad. The trancelike jazzy-music only adds to it's surreal quality and of course there's the ""haunting Torgo theme"". It also has one of my personal favorite segments when Joel and the bots are comntemplating monsters. NOW IF THEY WOULD ONLY RELEASE ""BRIDE OF THE MONSTER""OR ANY OF THE RUSSIAN MOVIES THEY DID. (Day the earth froze, Magic Voyage of Sinbad etc..)"
3,It was not the best episode ever!,"I've heard everywhere that this was the best mst3k episode ever. So like any MSTie I bought it. Man was I disapointed, even though the movie was terrible, the riffs just were'nt funny. The only parts I liked were Tom's Torgo voice and the final host segment. I also don't like Joel. I know he invented the show and he is pretty funny. I like Mike better in the theater and I like how the bot's torture Mike. Now don't get me wrong, I love anything and everything about mst3k. I just don't think ""MANOS"" The Hands Of Fate was that good of an episode."
5,Has to be seen to be believed!,"If you have not seen MST3K yet this is a great place to start. It has Joel and the robots ripping one of the worst films ever. I cannot imagine watching this film without those guys. There is no question in my mind that this is the worst movie ever. It is one of the only movies that I have seen in which every aspect of it is terrible. But, on the other hand every aspect of this MST3K episode is awesome!"
2,The original is better than the MST3000 version,"""Manos"" is considered as one of the worst movie ever made. I've seen the original version several times and I do believe that it is watchable, even enjoyable, Good campy film with an excellent performance from John Reynolds. The MST3000 version is ... and boring, surely because the original movie in itself isn't bad enough to be MSTied. The comments from Joel and the robots were great in some movies (check out ""Mitchell"") but ... in this one.So please, don't believe what people say: Manos isn't a masterpiece but also not a bad movie. Watch the original version and judge by yourself and give the original film a chance.Maybe you'll like it as a do."
4,"this movie is so bad,it took 3 times to watch all of it!","the movie is a waste of film but the guys make it worth watching! i couldn't wait to see how they handled the bad bad bad storyline and shooting. you have to have an iron stomach to watch this movie i actually felt sorry for the guys. well, just talking about it makes me want to watch again!"
5,A new definition of pain and suffering,"All I can remember after seeing this movie was exclaiming ""...that there was a two hour hole in my soul..."" But it was worth it! The greatest MST3k ever."
2,Almost too bad,"The main problem with this episode is that I doubt we will everwant to watch it again. The other MST episodes we've bought,Poopie, Pod People, and Cave Dwellers we've watched several timesand each time we hear and see stuff that we missed on previousviewings and laugh hysterically. Yes, Joel and the Robots did the best they could with it, but I really don't think I could sit down and watch Torgo, the dumbest family on earth,and the Master and his wives no matter how funny the guys are."
4,One of MST's very best,"Watching a movie like ""Manos: The Hands Of Fate"" without Joel, Tom Servo & Crow along for the ride, would have been about as much fun as getting a corkscrew in your eye. This is one of the most bizarre films ever made, and makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. And therefor, it gives Joel and the boys ample comic fodder...and they certainly go to town with it. Some of the best lines in MST history can be found during this film, and is definitely one of my all-time favorite episodes. Right up there with ""Cave Dwellers"" and ""Pod People"".The Satellite Of Love was never the same (IMO) when Joel Hodgson left, and this episode proves why he was so sorely missed."
3,Comment from Bunker Hill expert,"As an author of books on Bunker Hill, for adults and kids, I was pleased to find this reprint of an 1899 children's novel. Unlike many others from that time period, it is easy to read. If you don't mind the author referring to the central character as ""the youth"" and ""the lad"" you can enjoy reading this book. Though not as fast paced as modern children's novels, it succeeds in its goal of showing how teens in 1775 can have adventures. Most of the book is not about the battle."
2,My ball python hates it.,"He absolutely will NOT use this. Also, the top comes off too easily. I was very disappointed and so was Fitzsimmons."
3,Too small:(,Large is too small for sub adult female ball python but is great quality!! Deals like a real rock and would fit a smaller snake great!
2,"Creating, Implementing, & Managing Effective Training & Development","The book was received with pages missing and other pages duplicated in another spot. Other than that the book was in good condition and was shipped rather quickly. However, I had to return the book because part of chapter 2 was repeated in chapter 5 and those pages that it replaced were missing."
3,Useful but Expensive,"Material is terrycloth... you know, like towels are. The size is great for my beagle but might be a little small for an adult lab. I can't imagine it would even make a dent with a golden retriever! The little hand pockets are pretty awesome, so there is that as a selling point. I like the size, and the hand pockets, but for a $23 savings you could just fold and sew the corners down on an actual towel that you have laying around the house."
3,I was really let down...,"I was going on a long road trip and was really excited about buying this product. I read several of the reviews before I decided on this DVD player. The speakers are fine if you are inside watching a movie. However, if you are riding in the car it's really hard to hear the movie even if you turn the volume up all the way. Actually, I am going to send this DVD player back because the volume knob on the side of the player has a short in it. When you try to turn the volume all the way up it goes completely off. What a dud..."
4,"Toshiba SD0P2900 10.2"" DivX portable DVD Player",Good product ....many pluses but one negative is that it will not take some home recorded DVD's.
3,Be careful on your expectations...,"If you play a home made DVD-R the quality of the picture will be the same as less expensive players because even thought the screen is capable of higher resolution, its limited to the DVD resolution, so don't expect this player to make anything look better than the quality of the DVD its playing. I installed an SD card and after a long wait, the pictures came up and were very fuzzy. Can't recommend the slide show option on this player. The player itself seems to be of high quality and if you know the screen limitations beforehand, go ahead and get it but don't expect it to be a good photo frame. I returned mine and got the Toshiba P1900 9"" player and love it, even though it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the P2900 that most people would never use."
4,We save how much?,"A quick visit to Toshiba's site will reveal that the ""list price"" of this player is $299. It's a nice product, but why the need to inflate the list?"
3,Good quality picture and memory card reader,"Bought this product for the additional memory card reader so we could play photos from our camera. The unit reads the memory cards just fine and the picture quality is great, but the sort order for the pictures is odd. Its not by filename or any obvious date (created, taken, etc). If you want to make a slideshow, this doesn't work because even when you number the pictures they will not be in order! The player does have a programmable playlist, but it is incredibly slow and awkward to order and resets when you turn off the machine. I assume this ordering problem will be the same for movies and music stored on a memory card. Beware."
2,Toshiba Sd-P2900 10.2 DVD Player,The picture is clear but the sound is terrible. I had to buy a small external speaker to go with the product. The remote control leaves a lot to be desired too. It has to be pointed directly at the right hand corner of the DVD player. The play button seems to be located in an unhandy position too. The delivery time was excellent.
3,Toshiba SD-P2900 portable DVD,"This is a nice little unit for just watching a commercial video. The picture quality is fair and the sound quality mediocre. I sent it back because it doesn't have a USB port to connect a digital camera. When i inserted a Xd camera card, the picture quality was degraded from the quality I get from my MAC. So for kids or people just wanting to watch a video on the go, it works fine. Don't buy it for showing off your own videos though."
5,A MINI TV!,"Toshiba is the best in electronics! I have had 3 of their portable players. First one being SD 1400 7 inch screen, then SD 1850 8 inch screen & now the SD 2900. Each model is dependable & always gives the best picture. The 10.2 inch screen is like carrying around a tv rather than a portable device. It is the size of a laptop & will hold the stopped place on a disc when the machine is off. Battery lasts FOREVER! Went to Arizona (a 3 1/2 hour plane trip) & was able to use the battery in the airport as well as the plane without having to recharge once. A very good investment for dvd lovers."
2,Not so great if it only lasts 10 months,"First, the good points; when I bought this player, I was very happy with it (although the buttons which looked like they were back lit when on, turned out not to be, so at night I frequently press the wrong button). The picture quality was fine for a portable and while spendy, the quality seemed to be worth it. The negatives: VERY poor sound volume unless you use the headphones. Even at top volume the dialogue is difficult to hear, especially when people carry on quiet conversations. The worst negative is that I've only had the player for 10 months and it already needs repair. The quality is worthless if the machine doesn't work."
2,Really a big let down.,"This player comes with a remote, which is nice, but the remote doesn't do 2 very important tasks. You can't turn the machine on or off from the remote, nor can you adjust the volume from the remote. Why, Toshiba, why? Also, this player performs very poorly after extended play times. i.e. once it gets hot it doesn't like to play smoothly. DVDs, even brand new out of the case, play really choppy and are stop and go. Lastly; the player makes terrible, almost grinding, noises when playing DVDs. These noises are sometimes so loud that you can't even hear the movie. If it were a VHS player, I would expect the tapes to come out in pieces! Not a good buy for the price I paid."
1,P2900 DVD Player Sudden Death,"I liked the unit fine for the couple of months it worked, then it just stopped ""spinning up"" DVDs on start-up. Not worth my time. Just more disposable electronics . . . ."
4,Never leave home without it,"What a great product. I suggest good earphones if you use it on an airplane due to the excessive noise, but other than that, we love it!"
2,A bit big but pretty good before it stopped working,We bought this since an earlier Toshiba DVD players had worked great and with more kids we decided to get a second. Well the original older model is still goign strong - this stopped working after about 2 years of relativley light use. Should have gone with Consumer reports recco. the otehr issue was the controls are almost counterintutive to get to functions like dimming screen resolution so it doesn't eat the battery.
1,Horrible in Vehicle,"Bought this to put in our SUV for the kids to view. DO NOT BUY THIS FOR VEHICLE USE! It works very poorly in the vehicle. It constantly turns off and resets itself or stops. It will only go about 4 or 5 minutes before a problem develops. On the high end, it works nice in the house and the picture is good, but so are the televisions in our house. I am sorry I purchased this item."
5,Worth the money and then some......,This product is great. It has a terrific picture! Average sound. Good features! The size of the screen is wonderful! We can all watch a movie and not be on top of each other trying to see it. BEST SHIPPING I've ever seen. We are completely satisfied and then some. Can't wait to try it when we fly again. I would recommend this product to everyone.
2,no mac software,"Amazon didn't clearly show that this product only had PC software . . hard to understand.My old Visioneer DID have mac software, so I assumed this one would too. By contrast, other Visioneer products work on both mac and PC platforms."
3,not what I expected,it dose not copy photos well and the software dose not work like I thought. It dose copy documents but again the software makes it impossible to run my wireless printer.
1,Conflicts with other scanners,"I could not get the driver to install after several hours. Using Windows 7-64. It appears that if you have other scanners attached to your computer you must remove them and their drivers before you install the Roadwarrior. Since I have a high end photo scanner and a high end slide scanner attached, that was not an option. This is going back. Poor driver coding. Do not purchase if you have another scanner attached to your computer. If you are using a laptop with no other scanners this might work well for you."
1,Cannot find info to change defaults,"Help and documentation for the Roadwarrior is about as bad as it can get. I know it can be done, but I don't know how to do it: I have spent hours looking for information on how to change the default scan to 8.5 x 14. If I have to scan that size I am out of luck."
3,Not Quiet a Warrior,"I tried for a week, this scanner is slow, pages don't scan straight, older Strobe Xp are better and faster, Don't buy it ..."
2,Disappointed,"We had an older Visioneer USB scanner that worked quite well. It was about twice the size of this one, but we had high expectations of this brand. However, when we got it and started using it, it was not a pleasure to use like the old one. It's faster, but the problem is that it's hard to keep the paper to feed in straight and there's always a line down the section where the paper sensor is. The old scanner didn't have either of these problems. We tried cleaning it and everything, but nothing seemed to help. If you can get the paper in straight, with the exception of the line down the entire page, the image looks good, but we shouldn't have to deal with either issue in any scanner."
3,"It's Ok, butI have some reserve (One Touch Operations Only)","I'm not so sure it's as ""one touch"" as it claims to be. it scans well, but is subject to scewing the document as it's fed. If you don't feed it straight to begin with, it can easily get off line and really jam up. I'm not completely happy with the wa One Touch (OT) interfaces with Adobe, although it does what it needs to. I think the USB cable should be hard wired because it comes out easily and I've just tapped the unit and had it lose the connection in the middle of the scan. It's a very compact unit and great for traveling with, should that be your primary focus. Maybe not the ideal desktop scanner (to save space was my intention), but nice for portable operations. Ultimatly it's what I was looking for, but I expected a little more with the price I paid."
4,Pretty good so far,"In my case I bought this scanner not to go on the road a lot but to have all the time at my desk and not have a bunch of space wasted. So far it's working great and the software is awesome, I can easily combine scanned documents on one PDF and much more."
4,Excellent,This is a great little device that I highly recommend. Only complaints are: 1) the user-interface to adjust image properties is a little counter-intuitive -- you right click on an icon that doesn't seem like something you're supposed to right-click on. 2) Sometimes it is hard to make the paper go straight through without fooling the machine into prematurely starting to scan.
1,Broke after 3.5 years,"I really wish electronics manufacturers would make quality equipment again. I suppose 3.5 years is about the expected lifespan for things these days, but I'm sorta miffed that I spent $150 and it's dead now. It would also have been good if they had made software for Macintosh so I didn't have to run their Windows SW in a virtual machine. I don't know how Visioneer stacks up to other manufacturers (HP USED TO make a quality product) but I'm disappointed that I have a $150 piece of landfill junk."
4,Where lonely planet doesn't go,This book is excellent and essential reading for those of us who want to do an epic journey but also like to have help overcoming transport and beauracratic obstacles. I think the optimal would be to use this book in concert with a lonely planet style book as they cover different topics. This book is mainly a transport and visa stratgy guide with some helpful hints on routing. The LP books get the finer details on the budget accomodation for more cities.
5,A timeless atlas for serious travelers,"This book is by far the greatest travel guide I have ever bought. You may think I am exaggerating, but the wealth of information is simply unparalleled. This is not a travel guild in the traditional sense, but more of an traveler's atlas. Each page contains a hand drawn map of major destinations and travel time in between. Other maps contain roads, rails and boarder crossings, all meticulously annotated. For planning any epic trip across Asia, this guide will make your life a whole lot easier.Also note this book is 14 years old by now. Some of the trains may no longer exists and roads that use to take 8 hours by but now takes 5. But the geography stays the same. The monuments stood where they stood centuries ago and the roads that connect them is still there.To sum up, use this guide for pre-trip planning. But bring a recent Lonely Planet when you are actually in the field."
3,PSYCHO,"I like this record,good sounds whit duke, jaken and cypres hill's b real. My favorites songs:psycho city blocks and la conecta pt1."
4,psycho realm has to be on rotation,this album is one of the best from the cypress camp as a fan from day one the topics are hot as well as the beats i only hope they continue the realness to the streets & to the music.b-real lyrically stands out on this album than any other its definately a hot item & in heavy rotation in my ride. peace out from the east coast.
5,BUY IT!!,This is by far the best cd that cypress hill have brought out to date! The lyrics expressing true life stuff and not thought up rubbish.
3,An OK Cypress spin-off...,"Look, dis CD would be sooo hard if they just had better rappers! The beats are grimy, underground and dark...some of the best I've eva heard. But these two new fools that my man B-Real recruited are WEEAAKK! Usually B was not the best one on the tracks, but these dudes got you begging for him to come on. Bottom Line: If it was an intrumental CD, It would be one of my favorites, but the rapping can't cut it."
5,awesome dudes,"havent heard stuff like this since Cyprus hill decided to split...i am a white ...city ...boy...but so funky and sexy, cool ......dont like all there stuff but several classics i cant stop listening too.these dudes are the nads"
1,A dream come true if you're a stalker!,"Wow, this is a fairytale come true for all stalkers. The only part of the movie that made sense is when Emma told Will to leave her alone. A restraining order would've been the happy ending here. I'm in utter shock that anyone would consider this a decent movie. Although this is a ""movie"", I found it such a stretch from reality. They might have well ended the movie with her on both knees proposing to him while a random flash mob broke out into song and dance. The poor acting matched the horrendous script. The only credit I'll give the movie, is it kept me watching in shock of how I could predict the next outrageous scene over and over and over. It was almost like a game. Anyone who can relate to Will, I would recommend psychiatric help. I'll repeat this is two thumbs up for stalkers....any sane person, stay away from this movie!"
1,Bad acting,"I was not convinced that Will was in love. He showed no emotions when talking about the girl he loved. Worst of all he looked spaced out. I had not seen the entire movie, but what I have see had been enough to convince me that it's pretty bad."
4,Simple But Sweet,"Wow, did they pick the right actress. She actually convinces us this childlike drifter has a hot chick fall in love with him. These childhood friends in tragedy meet after 10 or 15 years and remember how much simpler life used to be. Minus one star for the hidden message: ""if at first you don't succeed, stalk stalk again"" and because the guy basically is a cheesy Owen Wilson impersonation."
3,Happy and sad. Good ending.,"This film causes us to consider the possible ramifications of waiting about what is really important in life. Overall, this is a good story and, in my opinion, worth watching."
2,Stalkers will love this movie...,"*Spoilers But read anyway* The main character stalks this girl he barely knows for his whole life and then finally confronts her. This movie is creepy! I swear I thought halfway through it that the main guy was some psycho killer and that I'd miss read the movie category and we were really watching a psycho-thriller. To impress her he became a CLOWN! Definitely puts across the wrong message to stalkers out there. If you spend all your life stalking a girl and become a street clown you'll get the girl, LOL!P.S. I gave it a 2 because Gerry, with Casey Aflec and Matt Damon, was still worse."
2,"The Plot Was Dull But Tom Sturridge's Acting Was Talented, Moving, and Excellent!","The plot and suspense of the movie was downright dull and boring but what keeps this movie alive is Tom Sturridge's lively and brilliantly talented performances as a street entertainer and the magic tricks he can do from juggling with apples and baseballs to fire sticks in the air. He was absolutely moving, lovable, charming and touching. I'd give him all the stars for his performance in this. But the rest of the movie was just...eh...nothing to really write home about."
5,A Truly Inspired Work,"This book is for everyone who has ever looked up into the night sky and wondered who we really are and where we came from, what the meaning is behind this journey we each make. A story of humanity and its journey through time which resonates deep within the soul. If you're on the fence, read this one."
5,I resonated with this book. What peace there is in knowing.,"This is a wonderful story. It brings hope and clarity, and simply makes you feel good."
2,Get it at the library,"More science fiction than horror, Koontz delivers a gripping story about the consequences of man's need to force evolution and become omnipotent. Set in a small town in California, the atmosphere is harsh and oppressive. The story, while inventive, feels far-fetched and intricate. Koontz sticks to his patterned characters leaving readers hearing that old familiar tune and feeling cheated. Pace is precise and balanced. Written in the third person, Koontz's style of writing is smooth with proportional amounts of dialogue.Now, after stating my own view on the book, let me say I did enjoy it. Granted, even though I saw the end coming a mile away, I still felt warm and fuzzy putting it down. This book doesn't try to be more than it is, a guilty pleasure with a rewarding conclusion. Yes, the characters are transparently trivial, but you still identify and root for them."
4,A SUMMARY OF THE MINI-SERIES - WITH ADDED SLEAZE!,"CRISPIN DID WELL TO INCLUDE ALL THE MAIN PARTS OF ""V"" AND ""V"" THE FINAL BATTLE. IT IS DETAILED AND DESCRIPTIVE------GIVES AN INSIGHT INTO CHARACTERS' THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS THAT COULD NOT BE SHOWN ON THE SCREEN. IF YOU'RE A ""V"" FAN LIKE ME, THIS IS A VERY GOOD BACK-UP TO THE EXCELLENT VIDEO COLLECTION OF THE BEST MINI-SERIES EVER!"
3,confusing,"I would have actually rated this a one for instructions, which were very confusing and not correct, but the device does transfer files at an excellent rate once you figure out how to use it, so for performance I rate it a 5."
5,At The Alter Of Sexual Idolatry,This book has cleared things up for this guy. Any man who has trouble withporn or women needs to read this book and do what God say. I highly advisethat pastors add this book to their resources. This book is outstanding forwhat it shares for men or boy's to do in case their slaves to porn and it'sgrip on men in our times
5,Every man's problem,"I have read several books that tell of the problem all men struggle with: sexual idolatry or at least lust. Christians are no different!In my opinion, every Christian man ought to read this book. This book grabs the bull by the horns, and in a Biblical way. You'll be fully satisfied with this book!"
1,Unhealthy logic from a subpar writer,"I acquired this book several years ago when I should have been living life. All it should take is a high school education to realize that this man is not talented, and the only reason for his success are the in-cult cronies from the Penetecostal church who would buy this garbage. I particularly enjoy the section where he assumes that all homosexuals are sex hungry fiends and nothing else. A blatant lack of statistics to back up his claims (which are upheld by hearsay and assumptions) should raise a red flag to anyone. If you believe the world is flat, buy this book."
1,Cookie Press Review,Product was cracked and pieces were missing. I wouldn't have purchased the item if these things were disclosed up front.
1,Piece of #$^%&!!@#&**,This is the worst thing I have ever had the misfortune to bake with. I expect so much more from PC. Your money will be better spent on a decent rolling pin and cookie cutters.
1,It's Not Just Me!,"I own this cookie press and was searching for the spritz recipe online and found the comments of reviewers on amazon.com. What a relief to know I am not alone! I can't get this thing to work for the life of me and was going to give it one more college try before moving it along the recycling train.I have used colder and warmer dough. I have attempted to use a knife to coax the dough 'trees' out of the plunger before they look like something out of a Playdoh hair salon. Yes, the back of the press pops off as if you haven't threaded it closed properly. Stop punishing yourself - it's the machine not the operator.Whew. Thanks amazon and reviewers! I won't waste another minute, egg or pound of flour."
1,Does not work. Period. Do not buy. Defective.,"As simply as I can put it, it does not work. Even using the supplied recipes, it does not have enough mechanical advantage to push the dough out. Terrible design and should be recalled. I know Pampered Chef has since discontinued this item and replaced it with a press with a screw drive.DO NOT BUY."
4,excellent,"book arrived timely, it is a bit higher level than expected, but satisfactory. I am certain I will be able to use this in my high school classes."
4,Cognito Releases a Good West Coast CD!!!!,This is the first release from Cog I have ever got and I gotta say I am pretty impressed with his work. I can listen to the whole cd and only skip like 2-3 tracks. Definitely would recomend this for any Hip-Hop fan b/c it gots something for everybody!!!!
1,Watch out for Vangard C/D's,"Well they have done it again, reissued another Clancy C/D under another title. They did this same thing on a Liam Clancy C/D and now this one.Let the buyer beware when it comes to Vangard there are also some other Clancy Brothers C/D's in the stores and on line that are the same one you may alread have under a different title. Three of the brothers are gone now, so I doubt there will be any new ones anymore."
3,Vanguard Years another scam,"I've actually heard this c.d. about 15 years ago. When it was first released in 1972. Vanguard just pulled another scam on us. We have to spend bucks on a c.d. on which we have 16 of the 20 songs and just hear 4 new songs. Remember ""Irish Troubador""......spend your money somewhere else."
4,Mostly great hits,"The other reviewers may have a point about this CD merely being a repackaging of previously released albums, but since I'm only borrowing it from the library I don't really care. I'm not paying a cent, I rip the songs I like and leave the rest. As for the music itself, I don't own every Clancy album ever made, so there are a lot of songs on here I'd never heard them sing before. The sound quality is excellent and you get 28 great and good songs."
5,A+ great example of what made this show so AWESOME,"my favorite line ""Why would anyone want to do that with Mitchell""This has become legendary in my circle of friends. Just calling out the name Mitchell causes a round of laughter and makes us pull out this movie for another viewing. I have owned the VHS copy of this episode for years and have watched it over and over again. So now that I am finally updating to DVD this is the first one I bought along with The Essentials (Manos, the Hands of Fate / Santa Claus Conquers the Martians) Yes fans vary on weather Joel episodes are better then Mike episodes and some where sad or stopped watching when Joel left (not me). But everyone seems to agree Mitchell is classic MST3K you cant do better as far as the writing goes. It has some of the best one liners in it and is a must see for anyone who is a fan of the show."
2,Technical Problems,"This isn't about the content - but the badly lacking quality of the DVDs. No this isn't about lacking features, since they never had many - but what appears to be new compression and pressing of this disk as well as Manos: The Hands of Fate. My copy of Mitchell seems to be ""warped"" for lack of a better word. Either that or it's taken a new record for putting out dull off-center throbbing sounds from BOTH of my DVD players.Manos is worse. In spite of having the hillarious Poopie Vol.1 reel on it, around track 16 (the layer change I assume), the playback stops. Not pauses - stops. Of course you can cue up track 17 and back up to the errant position and continue watching but obviously, Rhino decided to go cheap on these two disks (and future releases one's left to guess). Buyer beware - or keep that receipt in your quest to find a working copy."
4,Mitchell!,"I've only seen a couple of Mst3k video's. I must say this is one of the best. Especially when they poke fun at Joe Don Baker. If you liked this movie you will also enjoy ""Final Justice"" which also stars that pudgy but lovable Joe Don Baker."
3,Pretty Good,"Having been a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 for years, I was eager to watch this episode featuring the film ""Mitchell"". ""Mitchell"" stars Joe Don Baker in the title role of a detective who is out to solve crimes whether his bosses like it or not.I thought that the commentary from Joel and the robots was funny, but I thought the actual movie was kind of slow. After a while I started losing interest, which has never happened while watching MST3K. I would not say that this movie is bad, but I guess I'm so used to seeing really bad movies being made fun of on this series that this one didn't seem to live up to the standards I now have. ""Mitchell"" seems more like a legitimate movie instead of the horrible B-movies I'm used to.I would tell any MST3K fan to watch this film and form your own opinions. I would also suggest adding this film to your collection, regardless of what you think about the movie. You can never have too many MST3K episodes!"
5,Farewell to Joel,"This is the final episode staring series founder Joel Hodgeson, a sad, yet triumphant moment for the series. This episode caused an endless uproar of laughter between my friends and I; we love this one, and have deemed it a classic. While the film itself isn't as bad as some of the other MST3K episodes I've seen, like Angel's Revenge, it's certainly not worth seeing unless you're watching the MST3K version... Mitchell is an example of how funny the crew can be, and as a long time fan of the series, (I hate to say this) but how much poor Mike J. Neilson had to live up to in succeeding Joel... and how he never quite reached that level. Not only because Mitchell is one of the funniest episodes of Mystery Science Theater, but also because it's Joel's last episode, all MST3K fans need to ad this one to their collection."
5,It doesn't get much better than this,"I saw the premiere of ""Mitchell"" in 1994 at the University of Missouri, and I've been laughing ever since. For years, my friends and I have joked about what would be in a ""vodka chlorine"" (from the pool scene). Full of fun and smart remarks, ""Mitchell"" was a heck of way for Joel to bow out. You can't go wrong with this MST3K classic."
5,You guys get to watch Joe Don Baker films ?,"Oh thank god for the jump cut !!What can I say about this MST3K episode that has not already been said ? This is the episode I pop in when I've had a REALLY bad day. The wacca-chica-wacca starts and I'm in the MST3K zone. The crew is brutal to Joe Don Baker.... but he and everyone involved deserves it.Along with ""I Accuse My Parents"" and ""Manos..The Hands of Faith"" this is an MST3K essential. Don't miss it !!Just don't touch the baby oil."
5,Joel goes out on a high note,"Okay. Let's start by saying that Joe Don Baker gets every riff he deserves in this pointless and unlikeable police flick. Mitchell is a perfect cop ... but only on a police force headed by Darrel Gates.Joel, Joel, Joel ... we hated to see you go, but brother, did you leave with style. 'Mitchell' has some of the wickedest riffing and best host segments (Gypsy gets some well-deserved screen time all her own!) in all the MST3K canon.It may be a small mercy that this DVD does *not* include the uncut and unMSTed version of 'Mitchell'; personally, I would have liked to seen it on there, even if I never watched it. The original theatrical trailer is included, which is a nice touch.Any and all MST3K tapes and DVDs are must-haves, but this one should be had in your first wave of buying."
5,"This is what I'll remember when I think of ""Mitchell""...","...and I will think of it.It doesn't get any funnier than this. Some choice moments:-Merlin Olsen saying ""Nice Cap"" -""We're going to control the ghetto, you and I, young man."" -""He's giving his car a dickie."" -""My Mitchell, I think I'll keep him."" -""He seems dumb, I'll send him a pick-me-up bouquet."" -""Man...I'm constantly confused."" -""Ho man! A door! I didn't plan on this.""This is the all time greatest MST3K...but I have a fondness for the movie ""Time Chasers"" w/ Nelson."
5,MST3K Classic,"One of my favorite episodes. The riffing of Mitchell is hilarious. It was also Joels last show. Joe Don Baker should be grateful for MST3K, for he will always be remembered for something. BABY OIL! NOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
1,"Mitchell ""is that a extra feature?...No!""","As much as I loved Mitchell, I hated this DVD. Why? Well the biggest reason was that there was no extra features, except for the movie trailer for the Mitchell theater release back in the 1970's. If you already have the video tape, don't bother adding ths to your DVD collection unless you are a completist and just have to have this to sit next to your other MST3K DVD's.This was Joel's last episode, at least they could have given us some bonus features that has to do with Joel's time on the show. So my fave MST3K episode on DVD was a dud, just like JDB in Congo........"
1,Joel goes out on a boring note,"First off, I LOVE MST3K. I've laughed my way through dozens of MST3K episodes (most of which I've watched many times over) as well as the movie, but Mitchell may be the weakest episode I've seen. Joel mumbles even more than usual, and there are huge, laughless dead spots through much of the movie. Sorry, MSTies, a classic this one is not!"
4,Good general coverage,"This book provides an excellent grounding in some of the fundamentals of algebra, although, as the book points out in the preface, it is not complete in its coverage of algebra and has little in the way of proofs. Also, it does not teach you as many of the techniques for solving word problems that you will encounter in algebra outside of the book as it probably should do. A whole chapter devoted to word problems would have been good.This book is firmly aimed at school students or those who have forgotten the principles of algebra, and in that it is an excellent book. However, since no coverage is given to more advanced topics such as matrix or linear algebra, a title along the lines of 'Teach Yourself Elementary Algebra' would have been better."
2,Brit math not for americans,"This text runs the range from extremely basic (over-explaining the concept of negative numbers) to extremely challenging for the american trying to do math when there are so many British terms used in the problems. They say math is a universal language, but it's hard to make sense of problems using pence and pounds when they don't give any conversions. I was looking for a refresher on algebra I learned in high schoool, but this book is definitely not it."
1,algebra,was not of much use to my kids to help them pick up on algebra. Most examples and kid friendly language would have been nice.
3,You would think there would be more...,"I purchased this book on Amazon.com based on all of the rave reviews... and the not so rave reviews. It made the book seem like it was really groundbreaking. Let me tell you its not. Its okay. Good information, but nothing special. The truth is: this book is just another business plan book. Nothing special. Nothing totally groundbreaking for e-Commerce. Rather vanilla if you ask me. I don't see what all of this artificial hype is about, but its obviously not really about this book."
1,Where is the no star option?,"This book is a horrible waste of money. I really don't know what I am missing? Perhaps a few chapters... because I found nothing to rave about with this book. If you are looking for a business plan book for Internet startups, try a book with that title. Because beyond the flashy title of this book, there is nothing else."
1,Don't waste your time...,"This book despite its digerati appearance and hype is really nothing but old news. Real old. I found this book to be a terrible disappointment for developing a business plan in the technology industry. It grasps for air as it wrestles for a compelling concept and new information. The short company profiles are amusing, but fall flat as well. There is even a jargon generator to talk over people's/clients' heads to make yourself sound important! I kid you not! Perhaps this is the most telling part of the entire tome, as it tries to force feed me basic information as something glitzy repackaged garbage that tries to talk over my head --- but fails even at that.This isn't for serious technology companies, nor is it for new business upstarts"
5,Excellent,"businessplan.com took the ""guess"" out of writing our business plan. It even highlights different types of software and other business resources, many of which we utilized. Following the instructions presented by this author played a major role in helping us obtain a credit line and business loan."
4,Well-written resource for developing business plans,"I found businessplan.com to be a very informative and well-written resource. The ""Six Ways to Enhance Your Website"" was especially helpful for me being that I am in the process of developing my website. I appreciated the ""quick links to more information"" that were supplied throughout the book. The various worksheets are also a valuable business-planning tool. It is apparent that L. Manning Ross is a professional and very knowledgeable individual who is willing to share a wealth of business information in an easy-to-understand format. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to develop a professional business plan."
4,A compilation of brillinat ideas,L. Manning Ross did his/her homework well. This book is a valuable and informative tool and the unique concept is executed perfectly. The straight-forward presentation and clear wording are a real plus in a business-type publication. I shared it with several associates who were equally impressed.
1,FORGET IT!,"I really was excited about buying this book. It was a huge disappointment...it was like a tv informational for a really bad product. No real information...just fluff. If you want to write a businessplan for an interntet company...look somewhere else. If you want to buy this book and fall into the 'get-rich-quick-without-having-to-work-hard' trap, order this book today"
4,Great Texas Blues!,"The CD is from 1989, and still rocks the house!Russell Jackson, Mel Brown & Tony Coleman on Austin, Texas recording label Antone's, (which is also a nightclub in Austin), simply [great]!It's all great stuff on the album, but standout tracks include:Under Yonder, Hey Little Girl, Phone Booth, Cleo's Back, If It's All Night, It's All Right, and their cover of Bobby Blue Bland's classic 'Two Steps From The Blues', which Silent Partners do as a GREAT instrumental!I recommend this CD for some good time party Blues!"
4,Educational Review,"Great Information, very informative and practical. Great experiences and learning! Clearly shows how and what needs to be done to achieve great excitement and satisfaction! The video shows how to access and treat the g-spot and other erogeneous areas. It makes new discoveries of female ejaculation. It met my expectation and I recommend it for those who would like to step up their lovemaking and offer more excitement and pleasure to their partners. The lessons given are practical! Great video!!"
3,This film enables female ejaculation,"This film emboldens the female ejaculation discourse, enabling the effort for those who wish to discover. The film does not pretend to be a high-end commercial production. It is not. But most films in this vortex are passionate efforts to inform the world of a phenomenon unknown by even physicians in practice around the world. Hence the film quality. More recently, another G-Spot film, Liquid Love, (http://www.gspotwomen.com) which is produced by a commercial TV company, features Deborah Sundahl in her very best. Deborah really knows the g-spot and how female ejaculation works. This film casts real older women and their husbands; which represents most of America and real sexuality."
4,Sex Ed,My wife has been wanting to learn more about female ejaculation. This DVD is an excellent information resource for us.
2,NOTHING I DIDNT KNOW,I COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT. NOT A BIG DEAL DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. ITS JUST NOT WORTH SPENDING MONEY.
5,Female Ejaculation For couples,"The DVD was very informative from start to finish, I recommend it to every young couple to watch together."
5,Plus Items,"I find that this item works faster because it does not have to breakdown to work in your system. Rather than 20 minutes to feel it start working it is only about 10 minutesI am not good at reviews, but I do recommend this and have been using it for the last year"
2,"Nice design, poor performance","The iHome has a nice case with a dock connector for 3rd generation and above iPods. Unfortunately the volume seems to have problems - as in it's really not loud enough even when turned all the way up. The headphone-style connector (for non-iPods) works very poorly. Overall the design is very nice, but the performance and sound quality are quite poor."
4,Good for the Beach Go'er,"This is a good product. I personally bought it specifically for the beach. I was looking online for about 2 weeks for something that would keep my I-pod video safe from the blowing sand and this does it perfectly. Obviously it would be great if you could see the ipod, but if you want to then just open up the case. I'm fine with just putting the little guy on shuffle and if I dont like the song just pressing next. I also bring it into the office and it can be quiet enough for your enjoyment without bothering your co-workers. Overall I'd say buy it, you know the good looking ladies (or fellas) will want to sit next to you on the beach if your playing some good music ;-) and you'll have your Ipod nice and protected."
2,"Great idea, but failed on performance!","I have to say, I saw this in a local store and purchased it. I was so excited about the possibility of taking my iPod on the beach or anywhere that I wouldn't normally take it. Upon arriving home with it, I quickly hooked up my iPod and the sound that came out of the speakers was horrible!! Honestly, I was shocked at the poor sound quality. I promptly returned it to the store.... Great idea, but horrible sound!"
1,iHome just doesn't get it,"This unit is yet another iHome great idea gone wrong. As with so many other of iHome's products, their ability to charge the iPod device when the AC adapter is connected is hit and miss from model to model. I previously owned the earlier model of this, the iH13B, and it charged my ipod just fine...this one won't. This is progress?? Talk to iHome and they just shrug their shoulders and it's to bad, so sad, better luck next time. And why on earth would you make something that's portable with the ability to operate off an external power source and then not make it so you can plug it into a cigarette lighter plug?? Who ever heard of having a device work off 10 volts DC? Given iHome's consistent disregard for addressing these design flaws, I'd look to another manufacturer. If iHome is the only manufacturer that sells the kind of device you're looking for, make sure that it's at least charging your device as soon as you get it and by all means keep your receipt!"
1,No sirve,"Cuando compre el articulo me parecio que cumplia mis necesidades. A pesar de haber leido otros ""Reviews"" sobre la falta del cargador, me dicidi a comprarlo. Quede muy decepcionado cuando me di cuenta que los controles externos son algo duros y no responden muy bien, pero me dije que eso no importaba, que seguro era debido a que es a prueba de agua. El aparato me dejo totalmente aburrido cuando me di cuenta que si se dejaba un IPOD sonando por unos 3 segundos ya el panel de control externo queda totalmente inservible. Trate de mejorar la situacion colocando un IPOD de 3a Generacion, otro de 5a Generacion y hasta un IPOD Touch y con ninguno funciono bien. NO compren nunca este producto."
1,WARNING - Speakers very unreliable,"I received this as a gift. The speakers did not work from the beginning. The blue light is on. My ipod is playing, I can hear it using the headphone outlets, but nothing comes out of the speakers. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU HAVE THE RECEIPT AND CAN RETURN IT IF IT DOESN'T WORK SINCE THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT IS INCONSISTENT!"
2,Not the Best,Pros:-Fairly Sturdy-Waterproof-Charges Ipod (When plugged in)-Lightweight & very portableCons-Poor sound quality-Controls on front are finicky (Only work half the time)-Very bright front light-Ipod isn't accesible when unit is zipped up-Awkward Design
2,Disappointing sleeves,"The connectors are well built, with a small set screw to lock-in the cable. I used 14g cable and there is space for a larger cable. I removed the set screws and used the hole to solder in the cables. The disappointment comes in the soft vinyl insulator sleeves. I assumed these would be hard plastic with threads to secure them to the connectors, like so many RS banana plugs I have used. The ones included with these Belkin plugs are pretty bad. They slide off the connectors way too easily. Your best bet in plugging and un-plugging these is to slide the vinyl sleeve off the connector before doing anything."
3,Look Elsewhere,"I was really disappointed in these. I purchased a lot of Banana Plugs at a wholesaler online, but I needed a new batch fast. Rather than walk in a big box store and pay 3x as much, I ordered these through Prime. I was really surprised to see that they must be adjusted with an allen wrench. Out of all the banana plugs that's connected into my receiver, these are the ones that consistently are falling out.They work, but for the price I would expect better, especially for Belkin."
2,Lacking info on description,"These may very well work great...but not for me; the description doesn't mention that these are not compatible with 14 gauge speaker wire. That's a pretty large oversight. Who bothers using banana clips with 16 gauge wire anymore?! Unless you use hair-thin speaker wire, look elsewhere."
4,banana plugs ok,"easy to get wires into these banana plugs with the use of the enclosed wrench. They are a little fragile looking, and had to shove hard to get them to go into the slots on back of the receiver. Hence four stars instead of five. Good value for price though."
4,Belkin banana plugs,"This product's quality has slipped a notch due to the larger black and red sleeves around the connection point. Connection with the small flat head set screw is simple, yet secure, but those larger sleeves surrounding and protecting the connection are too loose and slip off every time you try to extract the plug from your speaker, receiver or amp. Earlier sleeves from Belkin were very tight and noticably smaller in diameter. Not a fan of this product revision, but still like them for their versatility in usage."
1,Waste of Money,"You're supposed to be able to crimp these to the ends of your speaker wires. Trouble is, the metal is so brittle that it cracks during crimping, The wires won't hold and the whole thing falls apart. I bought 5 packs and had to throw them all away. Don't waste your money. Spend a few more bucks for the twist on banana plugs."
4,Interesting journalism,"This is a fairly well written history of the drug sub-culture and the government, full of name dropping of users (Cary Grant, Thelonious Monk, etc.) and anectdotes of the era. Fun reading. Not quite at the level of Terrence McKenna, but still worth the three hours it will take you to read the entire book."
5,Best book on History of 60's,"This book is a superb, highly entertaining, and thorough history of the 60's. Its truly an incredible accomplishment to summarize so much material in so few pages. Through the chronicles of the LSD history, the reader is given a synopsis of the most fascinating period in America's history. It should be required reading for high school and American citizenship !"
5,Far out man,"Very interesting. If you lived in the 1960's you'll appreciate the insight. If you didn't live through the 1960's, you'll get a very good idea of what went down."
5,Tasty and relatively healthy,These are healthier than most crackers and taste great. I find that these Thin Crisps are tastier and have a better texture (less like shredded wheat) than the regular sized Trisuits. I enjoyed them very much.
2,Not a good fit,"Goggles look cool, but they press my glasses against my face, making them very uncomfortable. Considering the fact that I wear tiny metal frames (like John Lennon), I was surprised/dissappointed that these HUGE goggles don't fit over them at all."
3,Cool but wont fit,"The goggles are very nice and I like them but they won't fit properly over my prescription glasses, maybe they would fit over a different style"
1,No seal around glasses!,"There is no way these things could seal around your glasses! They did fit around my glasses, but there needs to be more foam, or rubber or something because they end up pressing on your glasses and leaving a gap. I guess if you don't wear glasses underneath they might work kind of."
3,Not what I expected....,"I'm a slow reader and I finished this in 2 days. A sort of ""Cliff Notes"" on Auschwitz. I'm gonna donate my copy to a school... this is not really worth the $$$$$. The information is there... but nothing you can really sink your teeth into."
1,Secret of the Ages,"I was disappointed in this book. I have read other things by this author, which were much better. He seems to be grinding out new works just for the additional revenue."
4,A Great Secret!,"This is a great ""foundation"" book for starting a Postitive libary. Easy to read and understand. Everybody needs it in their collection."
5,Better than Hemingway,"This guy is Hemingway with a heart. The sentences are economical. Each and every word has been picked like a particular tile in a mosaic. The metaphors are incredible, and he can mix his imagery to create magnificent parallels: women and animals, houses and museums. About twice per story, you'll stop at a line and just say, ""Wow."""
5,Brilliant and Beautiful,"James Salter's use of our language is so brilliant and original, it inspires awe. In one brief turn of a phrase he is able to illuminate entire lives, and yet his words are simple and direct. These stories are like beautiful Chinese puzzle boxes, with a rich lustre that only hints at the intricate mechanisms hidden deep within. ""Twenty Minutes"" and ""Akhilno"" will break your heart; each says more in eight or nine pages than most novels. What can I say? This guy kicks ass!"
2,Shocked at my disappointment.,"Was very suprised how disappointed I was. Figured the book would be work the read but it defintely wasn't worth my- [money]. Very short lived. The book isn't unclear, just seems to be written at a juniors level. Not sure where the other reviewers came up with 5 stars, I was lucky to come up with two."
5,Great sheets - Great buy!!!,"After having trouble finding sheet sets, with deep pockets for bottom sheet, I finally checked your site. OF COURSE! The price is fantastic, quality is great and I love both sets I purchased! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!"
4,Sky Blue Heavenly Sheets,"I got this order quickly and without any problem. I have been looking for a set of good quality 500 + thread sheets like this for a long time. Although I have found plenty, the price tag was always staggering. These sheets for this price cannot be beat. They are crisp, cool and soft. We absolutely love them! The only drawback is that they wrinkle easily, but that may be due to the fact that they were forgotten in the dryer for a bit. Good product, great value!"
1,Wrinkled and thin,I was happy with these sheets until I washed them - they came out of the dryer wrinkled like nothing I've ever seen before in a sheet. They looked like rice paper that had been wadded up and then opened up and spread out. They are thin and I find it difficult to beleive that they are 500 thread count. Once these sheets were washed they didn't look like a cotton sateen - they looked like old hospital and the almond looked more dingy than almond!!! The beautiful sheen is gone and they look old.
3,"Soft fabric, but not very sturdy","I really like the softness of these sheets. However, from washing twice, the fitted sheet is already falling apart. And they come our very wrinkled from the dryer. Which to me, is not a big deal. But some may like thier sheets non-wrinkled. I would have spent a little more towards higher quality sheets."
4,Excellent quality and soft,"I waited a few weeks until I washed/dried these Pinzon 500-Thread-Count Sateen Pike queen-size sheets a few times before I gave my review. I am happy to say these sheets are excellent. I read several other brand reviews before I decided to purchased these. I am pleased with the color... I choose (pink) which is a muted color, almost beige (I was afraid the color might be too bright). I am also very please these sheets did not pill. I have purchased other sheets in the retail stores, that were very expensive that pilled after the first wash, which I returned for a refund. Although I gave only 4 stars, these sheets did wrinkle somewhat easily and were ample in size. I have a pillow-top queen mattress with deep sides and the fitted sheet fit with extra give to it. The top sheet and pillow cases were of normal size. Overall, I am very pleased with this product and would recommend these sheets to anyone who wants quality sheets with a low price."
3,Sheet Set,The sheets are of good quality and they are truely for deep pocket mattresses. The only problem I find is that they come out of the dryer very wrinkled and need to be ironed if putting on a guest bed.
4,Great value,"I purchased these on clearance for around $30. Really a great bargain. They are not quite as lux as the 500 TC Sferra sheets I bought at Neimans, but they did cost about $300 less, and they are almost as good. Took off one star only because they wrinkle pretty badly out of the dryer, but worth the sacrifice."
3,"Hard to find King Size sheets for the price, period","New, in the package, these sheets felt amazing! I couldn't wait to get the satiny sheets onto the bed. I threw them in the washer and dryer before using them. True, there was a fair bit of wrinkling, but I expected that. The silky-smooth feeling that was so alluring on the unwashed sheets disappeared once they went through the washer/dryer. Nice quality sheets, great for the price, but not that much of an improvement over my previous 350-count sheets."
3,500 thread count king sheet set,"The sheets are soft, but, they wrinkle A LOT after washing. Also, I only used them once and I hung them out to dry and they got stained from the laundry line. The stains would not come out. They are indeed soft, but they already look like old sheets."
3,OK item - not wow,"The sheets are quite comfortable, though not as soft as I expected.What bothers me is the fact that they are noisy!Yes, it sounds weird, but it's true.When you move, the sheets make a noise, sounding like paper being crushed or a page being turned. If you have a light sleep, you might awake...I've had a sheet set with less thread count that was softer than this.And, as with all similar sheets, they do wrinkle a bit.I don't mind, but if you want a neat hotel style bed, you might have to iron them."
2,I was expecting more,"I bought these when they were on clearance for around $30 and thought I was getting a great deal on expensive sheets. Unfortunately, they are probably only worth about $30. Even after washing they are still kind of scratchy and not particularly comfortable. I think they must be made from a low-quality cotton. They don't ruin my sleep or anything, but I guess you get what you pay for (...if you are paying the clearance price)."
2,But keep in mind...,"Hans Urs von Balthasar was Barth's GOOD FRIEND; not only did they attend each other's seminars, and not only was the book the result of NUMEROUS conversations with Barth himself, but BARTH ENTHUSIASTICALLY RECOMMENDED BALTHASAR'S BOOK. Hence Balthasar's understanding is not merely some ""intellectual paradigm"" that needs to be ""overthrown"" by yet another interpretation, but a deep and personal organic understanding, not an ""outsider's"" view, as the author claims. Yes, this is a very good book, but it does not succeed in showing that Balthasar's understanding, approved by Barth, and written from conversations WITH Barth, was wrong, nor that Barth would agree with this one!"
3,Mediocre DVD...,They left out several important videos from the Cure's early years:Killing an Arab10:15 Saturday NightJumping Someone Else's TrainA ForestPlay For TodayPrimaryOther VoicesCharlotte SometimesThe Hanging GardenA Night Like This
4,Cure VHS,The price was right and the quality was fine--arrived in timely manner--taped covered entire early career and was very enjoyable--love the Cure
4,Hidden Features on DVD,"1) Go to the song select. There is a hidden star after ""Just Say Yes"" that shows the ""Greatest Hits"" album cover.2) ""The Caterpillar"" Highlight ""The Walk"" and press down, right, right.3) ""Close To Me (Closer Mix)"" Highlight ""Close To Me"" and press up, up, up.4) ""Pictures Of You"" Highlight ""Friday I'm In Love"" and press down, down, down.All 18 videos are under Title 1, Chapters, 1-18.All 6 acoustic videos are under Title 2, Chapters 1-6.The Cover of the Greatest Hits album is under Title 3, Chapter 1.There are three bonus videos:""The Caterpillar"" is under Title 4, Chapter 1.""Pictures of You"" is under Title 5, Chapter 1.""Close to Me (Closer Mix)"" is under Title 6, Chapter 1.All of the videos, including the live and hidden videos are available in both 5.1 and stereo mixes."
2,Everyday36,Despite what other reviewers have said this dvd is not 5.1 surround sound i am more than a little dissapointed.The music obviously still is very good ill leave the videos up to the viewers interpretation. You might want to just buy the greatest hits cd although i dont know if it has all the same songs.
1,Size issue or size matters,"I like 3 m filters, I used them in my old house all the time. My new house take 4 inch thick filters so I order a 4 inch filter. The box says it 4 inch but it is really 4.25 or ,4 1/4 which means it does not fit. Nowhere on the it the box does it say the filter is larger. I have to bend the filter in order to get it to in the holder. Out over $100.00 on filters that do not work. 3m should know better."
1,Wrong size,The size stated in the description is wrong. Now that I have torn the wrapping on one of the filters I cannot return them. I'm out over one hundred dollars and still have to buy filters. I am not a happy camper.
1,The sizing was all wrong!!,I ordered the items because it was at a very good price. I have paid $40 per filter before. This would have been a good deal but the sizes was too large and could not fit in my ac unit. This product is mis-sized....
2,Not A Great Western,"I picked this book up along with a Max Brand novel, the Tyrant. Now, I know I shouldn't look for much when it comes to mass paperback genre fiction. I really was just hoping for a quick read, some humor and decent writing. I got humor, if only because Johnstone creates a nutso character in Smoke Jensen. I mean, in the plot....wait, sorry. I finished it an hour ago and for the life of me, can't remember the plot. All I really remember is the showdown between Smoke and York and 4 Mexican banditos (complete with handlebar moustaches and gun belts across the chest) backing up an Englishman captured family and platearmored Pullman. Yep, fascinating. Took me three days to read, it was that bad. Sorry, only deserved 2 stars, 1 because it's a western, 1 because it's written on paper."
1,Not what I ordered,"I didn't receive the product because it was NOT what it seemed. It was the remake from the 70's. I wanted the org. LP cover that was band due to its cover being ""off"" for viewers under 18."
5,Fiddler's Delight,"There is an Irish joke that says when St. Peter heard heavenly fiddle playing, he thought Frankie Gavin had died, but when he looked, it was only God trying to play like Frankie. The fiddle and overall music on this compilation make it my favorite Irish album."
5,Revenge on Men,"I can't believe that this author is a man. Some of the things that he has the women in his stories do to exact revenge against the men in their lives definately reads like a female author out to settle a score against men. Either that or a man that has met some very mean women.Regardless, this book kept me laughing with lots of evil grins. Don't let the ""erotic"" turn you off -- I don't feel that anything in this book is extremely erotic in nature given the tone that it's written in. I've read more explicit scenes in modern day romance books.Woman who read this can live variously though the woman in these stories who exact revenge on the men that have abused them. Men who read this might think twice before messing with the little ladies.Regardless, these stories are a perfect read especially after a long hard day."
2,The Exciting 80's Nostalgic Moments Hindi Film Songs DVD,The DVD was not very good. It would get stuck at places and I had to restart it from beginning and skip some songs.
1,not what I purchased,"I ordered this thinking it was a series. However, I only received one book. The price was reasonable, but I expected an omnibus type offering. What I got was a single Sam Durell book _ the first one _ assignment to Disaster.The book itself is an interesting read especially to veterans of the series for Sam meets Diedre Padgett in this one.It has the usual cross and double-cross which is featured throughout the Durrell series.However, it does not make up for the disappointment of getting one story instead of several.Again, the book is worth the price. But you only get one novel."
1,Nonsense!,"A better title is The Same Old Rank and File. Unions often have the same problems as the communist governments of old. They often benefit top leadership at the expense of the workers they claim to represent, and use scare tactics and violence to punish those who wish to decent.Second this book fails to acknowledge the thuggish behavior perpetrated by unions over the last 150 years. Just within the Teamsters alone intimidation, threats, destruction of property, and murder were used on those who stood in the way.Therefore,I must give 1 star. If none were possible I would give this book none what so ever."
5,"Squeak Carnwath: Lists, Observations, and Counting","A wonderful monograph that allows the reader/viewer to explore the world of this delightful California painter. A short essay gives insight to the life of the painter which in turn creates more interest in the work its self. But this book is all about the paintings. The reproductions are of the highest quality. Which allows the viewer not only to examine surface quality but also the use of space on these very rich, flat, and simply complex paintings. What this book illustrates best is the artist's ability to contemplate everyday activities and breath new life into them with richness and humor. Creating unabashed abstractions at the service of visual pleasure. This is an exciting introduction to the wonderful world of Squeak Carnwath."
3,"Cute, but wished night light switch lasted longer","We got this lamp to go in our nursery and to match the rest of the set. We have a really bright awful overhead light so I really wanted a lamp to soften the feel of the nursery. I would have given this lamp more stars because it is really cute and the lamp is great and creates the perfect light, but the night light doesn't come on anymore (yes I've changed the bulb) which is annoying because now I have to buy a nightlight. I should mention that this problem began after about 18 months, it didn't happen right away. The switch just clicks through the three settings and only the main lamp works. It could be a wiring issue, so maybe it is just mine that is having this problem (no one else mentioned this problem). Other than that though, the lamp is great and super cute."
4,Like it!,"It's a small lamp that is perfect for a nursery. In addition to the regular light, the night light option is great. Don't bother with the alphabet soup night light - it's not made well, stick with just the lamp."
3,A Slasher Film With A Twist,"Cherry Falls is another teen/school horror film. That's not necessarily a bad thing. This one, however, has a different take on the usual killer m.o. Brittany Murphy stars as a small town girl who realizes that her sheriff father, played by the always solid Michael Biehn, has some dark secrets to a serial killer who's preying on virgins. There's the twist. Normally, the killers go after the ones who have sex. It's not anything extraordinary, but it's a nice twist. Brittany Murphy is a great actress. She is a great heroine. She's real and believeable. The great Candy Clark plays her mother. Unfortunatley, she has a small role and doesn't get much to do. The killer's identity may be pretty visible for some people, might not be for others. Jay Mohr co-stars as a teacher. The movie is very sexy and the climax is pretty messy. It's nothing new, but as far as the genre it's in, it's above average. Give it a try. It's not half bad."
3,A cross between American Pie with a body count!,"Laura Lee Sherman was raped and brutally murdered by several drunk students. Several years later, a serial killer butchers virgins at a high school dressed as Laura Lee. The virgins must stay safe so they have a ... party in a mansion and that's where all the madness breaks loose.Jay Mohr (Pay it Forward) and Brittany Murphy (Clueless) star in this horrific, suspenseful who-dun-it thriller!..."
1,Don't waste your time,"What could have been an intriguing twist on the teen slasher genre, quickly plummets into banal and expected actions and offensive portrayals. It's ""Psycho"" meets ""Scream"" basically. I found the movie offensive because there's no reason for the killer to crossdress, so the only reason he's dressing that way is because he's the killer apparently. Which is highly offensive to transvestites and queers. At least in ""Psycho"", Norman was trying to become his mother, but in this movie, there is absolutely no reason given."
2,too cursory,"cursory...there's a lot of talk without much being said. i got the national geographic guide to american national parks, and it's much better than this book."
2,What secrets? -- Louis J Sheehan,Exactly what -- are any? -- secrets derived from the dead? Why not show us more details regarding the explanation that the Italian Skipper wasn't responsible whereas the Swedish crew muffed it? Louis J Sheehan
4,perfect condition,The cd took a little while to arrive but the sender did say it would. It arrived in perfect condition and it is really nice having an album that is hard to find on cd format.
5,one of favorite Discs,"I'm a big Crusaders fan&this Set adds to there rich legacy leaps&bounds.a strong collection of Songs&solid Arrngements to match Joe Samples touch on the Keys.Wyane,Wilton&Stix add there usual touch on this set.still feeling this Set."
2,"Misleading, outdated and superceded","This is probably the most widely read biography of Jean Laffite, as substantiated by the fact that this work was first published in 1930. However, it mixes fact with mythology and ends up with enough fiction to leave the reader with a false report on the man and his life. For probably the best and most thorough scholarly work on Laffite, see the very recently published ""The Pirates Laffite: The Treacherous World of the Corsairs of the Gulf"" by William C. Davis' (Harcourt, May 2, 2005) Amongst several revelations: The contributions of Laffite and his men to the 1815 Battle of New Orleans were likely only negligible at best, and of honor he had little to none. However, what is lost to romantic fiction is offset by rare insights into a place and period of transition in American history, the Louisiana Purchase and its early aftermath. (Come to New Orleans for awhile and you'll find that the transition still isn't complete, and if luck prevails, it never will be.)"
5,Lafitte the Pirate,"This is my favorite privateer!! According to the El Lago Historical Society, Lafitte used to come to our neighborhood to hide from our first Navy Ship and/or to repair their ship after a damaging fight. Very interesting character!! Was NOT a pirate actually, but a gentleman privateer and smuggler of goods into LA when the US stopped allowing goods going into LA in hopes that they would buckle down and join the United States. Jean Lafitte was a war hero of The War of 1812 in New Orleans; then the current US Governor of LA following the war thanked them for their service and then immediately arrested as many as possible to hang them as pirates!! That's when Lafitte and what was left of his crew came to Galveston Island, TX. I have seen the remnants of his house's (or should say Fortress?) foundation and it's front steps. The Governor placed a price on Lafitte's head; Lafitte then placed a much higher fee on the Governor's head!! Gotta love him!"
2,The dragon's breath is cold,"I listened to this CD at my local record store last week and found it very dull. TD don't continue with their newly found techno sounds of ""Transsiberia"" and ""Mars Polaris"", instead of boring the listener with unbelievably lengthy and lame ambient soundscapes and weak melodies. This album doesn't offer more than ankle-deep background music. Some Chinese sounds are thrown in as an alibi for ""world music"". Very disappointing!"
1,Endless problems.,"I purchased one of these and had to return it because the unit would freeze while playing or would refuse to turn on. I found through an internet search that many people have had this problem. I later purchased the RCA RT2390 and it is almost the same unit, with a better subwoofer and no receiver problems."
2,Similar Problem,"We have used the system for 7 months, and now the receiver doesn't turn on. Will try getting a hold of RCA, but unless I get lucky, there is no way that will happen such as with the other reviewer. Could just be the receiver though, but the speakers are not quite worth $140 on their own."
4,"Solid System, Great value","I've had this system for a few months now, and ive had no problems whatsoever. Setup was easy enough, you can adjust the levels on the individual speakers for just the right sound, theres a nighttime setup to minimize disturbance to your neighbors. And if there isnt enough bass for you, theres a plug for a second subwoofer. I scare my friends when they watch movies and something explodes - great! All for 149.95, no shipping on a 36 lb box...insane!"
1,Do Not Buy This System,"I bought this system for a ""great price"" and it was great while it worked...then about a year afterwards it would lock up and not function.. Then finally it stopped working all together. I did an online search and found that this is very common with this system. Do the research and you will find the same. Save your money and buy another system after you do the research!"
2,"May have been good, it it were real for Elizabeth Taylor!","The ring is actually a pretty smokey quartz ring, but it was very big. If you had seen, Elizabeth Taylor's pear shaped diamond ring in photographs , that's how big this one is. It was just too much for me. I returned it and ordered one that I hope is at least half the size as this one."
5,BOLD,This is a beautiful bold ring - the stone is beautiful. If you are looking for a bold smokey quartz ring you will not be disappointed with this ring. It looks much more expensive that it actually was.
5,Beautiful!,"I bought this ring because I wanted a nice right hand ring. I love it! It is a rather large ring, but it's meant to be a cocktail ring so I was expecting it to be large. The quartz is cut nicely and set well, and the ring is well made and comfortable. The only downside I've encountered has been the little swoops that go over the gem catch on things, but besides pulling my hair a couple of times, it hasn't been an issue. I'm extremely pleased with this ring."
3,Don't be fooled..,"If you are in the business, this book can be a little educational.The main point in the successful of a business is the PR and have a vast (or worthy) business net and the reputation.Negotiation is important but you will have nothing if you cannot start a negotiation. You think that can make a deal with a famous? Mark H. Mccormack amass a fortune not only following this instructions in this book, also with their contacts and he say nothing about it. ;-) Of course only a dumbass can success in the life and talk about their secret to how to obtain it.Anyways, the book is a little boring."
4,Good Product for the value.,Loved the fabric. Mother-in-law wanted it for doing embroidery on it. She loved it and was really excited to work on it.
5,Celia Rocks,"I bought this album and put it on the stereo. You can't believe the energy this woman puts out. It's impossible to sit still when listening to it. Celia is the embodiment of Latin music. The tempo and lyrics will have you moving. You can FEEL what she's singing. ""Viva La Celia"""
5,Fun Fun Fun and Dancing!!!,"I received this CD and bonus DVD yesterday and Oh My Goodness!!!! I am having so much fun listening, looking, and Dancing. I haven't quite gotten over, the disappointment of, Miss Celia's passing but, surely now she is up in heaven (looking down) laughing at me...as I jump and dance around the house. I haven't had so much fun with a CD/DVD ever. Thank You God for Miss Celia Cruz ~"
3,wireless voip handset,"A wonderful product, requires less or painless configuration. Bit pricey though! International buyers - Please purchase a 110 to 220 voltage converter. As the logitech ships with a U.S adapter for charging the handset.Suggestion - If Logitech can include a handsfree & a universal charger, that'd have been great."
1,"Poor battery life, non-stop static","You literally need to charge for an entire day to talk for several hours. You cannot charge and talk at the same time, so once this phone is dead, you need to wait at least 30 mins to charge or this phone dies in a sec to call back and say ""Sorry, the battery died so I will call you back.""Also, non-stop static noise. Voices completely break when both sides start to talk."
2,Not outstanding,"Will not work on Windows 7, works OK on XP and Vista. This wasnt made clear when purchasing.The handset is very small.Overall it works fine."
1,Prodcut is End of Life not supported by Logitech anymore,"I bought that phone, couldn't get it to work with XP machine running latest Skype and when I called Logitech for help I was told they don't support this product any more. I am returning this product to the seller."
2,Lousy overview - substantial photographs,"If you're looking for an in-depth, fresh approach to Queen Victoria, and you already know the basics of her life, this is NOT the book to buy. Incredibly repetitive - entire paragraphs that were almost word-for-word repeating an earlier section, inattention to detail (chloroform is just wonderful and all, but Jaffe reviews its importance every 5th page!) and shows a lack of present research (Latest findings show that Prince Albert was actually killed through stomach cancer that he contracted several years before he died - Jaffe only mentions typhoid).The photographs were the only positive part about this book - rich information surrounding her life.All together a poorly written book for a reader who wanted substantial, indepth details about Queen Victoria (and who already knew the wonderful advances of chloroform!!)"
5,complex & timeless,"An incredible recording. Layers of sound, percussive and melodic. Each listening will reveal something you hadn't heard before. Tibbetts definitely deserves more widespread recognition of his talent. This is one of those recordings that will often invoke a craving to hear it again."
5,The Best Bike Helmet for Me,"I love the unique color and design and the fit is just right for my head. Also, I can attach a flashlight holder on this helmet.If ever I need to buy a new helmet, I'll probably buy a newer version of this helmet. Giro Xen."
5,A Great Price AND Stylish,"Being that I was in the market for a new bike helmet, I wanted something that had a real unique and funky look. The minute that I saw this helmet I was sold. I tried to buy this helmet in Canada and all I have to say is ""Good Luck"". I waited 6 months for this helmet to come in from my local bike shop before I gave up and canceled the order. As I normally always do I thought I would check Amazon to see if they sold it and sure enough they do....and for 30% less than I would have paid originally.As for the fit, the helmet fits great and the straps are molded right into the helmet itself so they don't shift all over the place. I love the look, the fit and the price. What more do you want?"
4,Safe helmet,"I bought this helmet for my nephew and he loves it. The helmet is lightweight, airy and fits well on his head."
3,Best for matted fur,"This comb's best use is for untangling matted fur. We have three cats: one short hair, one medium hair, and one long hair. This comb does not function well as an everyday grooming tool, even on the long haired cat, which is what we needed and what the item's description includes."
4,Sturdy and great for medium and long hair cats!,"My elderly long hair Birman can no longer groom because of arthritis so I've been brushing and combing out his tangles for about a year. I was using a flea comb which needed to be replaced. Bought this one and it works well on my old boy. The handle is nice and large for a good comfortable grip. The metal on the comb portion comes to dulled points so it won't poke your pet. I am very gentle when working on getting the matted fur from my old cat and this one works well.I also have a short hair and this doesn't work particularly well on her because the teeth of the comb are not close enough together like my old flea comb. I'll have to get another flea comb for the short hair.Overall, it's well made and me and my Birman really like it!"
4,Georgia V UNC 1982 Classic College Clashes,"A Great college game with Marv Albert comentating, this 1982 game is almost a classic. With Dominique Wilkins leading Georgia and showing his atletic ability he comes home to play UNC. The Bulldogs hang around but UNC have too much talent with Big Game James, The Big Smooth and MJ.Unforntally there was no shot clock back then and both teams played a zone so some plays are a bit boring. The Bulldogs did not goto Dominique nearly enough even though he had 19/12 and a stagering 5 blocks. There is also a nice interview with the Human Highlight Film after the game.I have never seen a game where Michael Jordan was so passive and letting the game come to him. A few nice highlights but nothing like i expected. The start for UNC was Worthy and he delivered. A great game and is highly recommended."
4,Safe House,"At times the movie dragged, but it was enjoyable. Like Denzel movies and he has made quite a few good ones in past few years."
4,"3 and 1/2 stars really, still entertaining","Not quite 4 stars though close enough I gave it that. Plenty entertaining, and pretty well done. Each actor did his part well. Story was pretty good. Couldn't quite put my finger on it, but it lacked a little something you kept hoping it would have. Maybe more redemption for Denzel's character. A better ending would have helped. The ending seemed rushed, abbreviated like they ran out of time or ideas."
3,Pretty nuch what I expected- entertaining enough,"I am never disappointed with Denzel, and this was no exception. I didn't think I could suspend my disbelief of Van Wilder as CIA, but Ryan Reynolds did a pretty good job. All in all, good action throughout the movie, but fairly predictable plot. And as for the ending, only in Hollywood. This kid would have been better off stomping that file into the dirt than calling out every top level intelligence agency in the world. He never would have a moments peace for the rest of his days no matter how many it brought down. Otherwise, it was worth renting."
4,action the way you like,"Cold cruel action done right. Well scripted, good acting and realistic stunts. Gets down and plays just a little on the dirty side of spy craft."
3,Ehhh...,"Pretty run of the mill action movie. Maybe I should lower my expectations of Denzel...also, Ryan Reynolds should return to comedy if you ask me."
4,Good movie,"At the brick and mortar store this retails for around 18.99-24.99 still. I got this on cyber Monday and watched it on the Thursday when it came in. Movie was good, and it keeps you guessing until the end."
4,It was tons of actions,"A great movie!! Denzel and Reynolds are great. There is tons of actions, exciting car chases and many surprises.It was pleasantly entertaining etc...."
1,WARNING: Disc is unusable without a network connection,"My review is not about the movie itself, rather the disc. My blu-ray player wasn't connected to the internet and we couldn't figure out why it would work. The menu showed up but it wouldn't play as it just looped back to the main menu. I restarted my blu-ray player with the network connection plugged in a voila, it was a totally different look. Thank you Universal for delivering ads (upcoming blu-ray releases) to the disc's home screen. I am thoroughly unpleased that I have to have a network connection just in order to watch the movie I purchased."
3,SAFE HOUSE PLAYS IT SAFE,"SAFE HOUSE is a predictable by the book car chase, foot chase action thriller, ably directed and adequately performed. Denzel Washington brings his usual charm in the role of a rogue CIA agent pursued by the eager young ""safe housekeeper"" earnestly played by Ryan Reynolds. Of course, government corruption and cover-ups are involved. The identity of the ultimate villain is fairly predictable. Supporting the two leads are Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga, Sam Shepard, Ruben Blades and Robert Patrick.At 115 minutes, SAFE HOUSE overstays its welcome but ultimately its an entertaining diversion."
3,Gory,"Denzel Washington plays another bad guy. I liked the story line and the hero theme, but there was so much blood and gore."
3,Action but little else,"Safe House is certainly full of action and intrigue and the actors do the best with the material they have to work with. But there could have been more. Denzel Washington is fairly believable as Tobin Frost, but Ryan Reynolds less so. The locations are great and the action is fast-paced. If you are looking for pure entertainment and don't have too high hopes than this is for you."
3,Good for a rental,"This movie was not bad. It got kind of boring at times, but that's how cia/rogue agent movies are, but then some shootout or hand to hand combat scene will happen and spark the movie back up again. Of course denzel was great as usual and ryan played a good part, but every one new martial arts but him. He held his own though. He was kind of a disappointment to me seeing as how he is supposed to reprise the roll of my boy deadpool next year, and deadpool knows every fighting style ever invented. But anyway aright movie worth a rental, but for me I'd only watch it one time so it won't be collection worthy."
3,Predictable,The acting was good however the story was as predictable as any CIA drama of the past few years. It is much better than others but won't be a movie of the year.
1,SafeHouse,"Not at all what I expected. Great cast, but didn't help the overall movie. Buying this was a waste of money.Disappointing!"
1,Horrible,"Slow, boring and predictable. Recipe for 2 hours wasted that you'll regret and never get back. While Denzel does an OK job, the script is pretty limiting. I wondered how Reynolds would be in a serious action role and he was, as I suspected, not believable and bland."
5,A Great Fast Paced Movie,"I've never seen Ryan Reynolds in this type of role before and I must say...he did very well with it. The movie has lots of action packed sequences plus a story concept that holds your interest...all making for a great movie. Denzel, as always, does a great job of working a character who is complex and intense. Take the time to watch Safe House, you will not be disappointed."
5,My Safe House Review,"Hey, what can I say, its Denzel and no one can do action/suspense better than my brother. Denzel played this part to the T and should be nominated for his role but I doubt it or maybe he will since his character is not clean cut and legal. Highly recommend you had this one to your collection, especially if you enjoy watching him act as I do."
4,Loving Safe House,"Of course with it being a Denzel movie the plot is usually the same; he's presumed dirty/really bad S.O.B. but turns out to be a good guy all along. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time with the split second changes in direction for the characters. In some of the plot, the build was almost foreseeable until the end. It may have been different for other reviewers. I am trying not to be a spoiler so I'm trying to be vague, but show my love of this movie. The soundtrack throughout was also spot on. But who watches a movie for the soundtrack, right?! Enjoy; and make your own opinion!"
3,Don't get excited.,"This movie was OK. That's about it. Thankfully I rented the video and didn't make the purchase. I don't think the acting was as good as it should have been, and the story could have been better. I'm hoping there is not a sequel in the works..."
3,Safe House,Movie was not one of my favorites- Was not what I expected= too much like other movies- too predictable- wouldn't recommend
4,Thrilling,"This movie keeps your on the edge of your seat most of the movie. I was never bored and didn't notice the time fly by as I watched. The intensity of both actors is very good and you end up rooting for the good (Ryan) and the bad (Denzel) guy. Ryan Reynolds plays a safe-house manager who receives an extraction team holding Denzel Washington in custody. Denzel plays a secret agent who went rouge years ago. He is using the safe-house to try to get away from some thugs who are trying to kill him but of course they find him and then the run is on. Ryan tries to keep Denzel in custody as the two fight off waves of thugs, all the while the government is trying to determine is Ryan has gone rouge too. It's a good movie and I will probably see it again."
2,Not up to Benzel''s standard,"Lots of action, very unbelivable. Really not up to Benzel's standard. Not worth the money or the time to watch it."
4,Safe House,"Intense movie. Action packed. Denzel Washington does everything well, and Ryan Reynolds is even believeable, as a frustrated CIA agent."
4,Denzel great but,This movie is a good action flick but definately not one of Denzels best. It was entertaining but the plot was just ok and time jumps a few times in the movie so you lose plot but get more action. The twists if you call it that are easy to see coming.
3,Good if you need to waste a few hours,"Movie: C-Acting: B-Plot: DOverall: CVery weak plot. Storyline makes zero sense. If your going to make an unbelievable movie, add some super powers."
4,Pretty good,"Safe House is a pretty good movie. I liked the story, but towards the end it was kinda predictable. The acting was good, but of course I expected good acting with the actors they chose. The action was great, probably the best part. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
4,Great flick,Definitely a guy movie. My son wanted to go see it. I didnt. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Nonstop action with a likeable ending.
4,"Not ""Man On Fire""...But Just As Good","Great plot twists, Jaw-dropping Action, and overall very well put together. Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds really pulled this one off. This was a highly entertaining CIA movie and I deffinitely recommend as a purchase."
4,Pretty Good,"I thought it was pretty good in spite of the ratings giving by professional critics who are usually wrong anyway. Everyone keeps saying it was predictable then giving it 2 stars. I would like to see their ratings of top movies like Avatar which were just as, is not more, predictable. Unfortunately, unimaginative movies are the way of Hollywood, who would dare ask for anything more."
1,This movie made no sense whatsoever,"I'm as big a fan of simple action movies as anyone, but the plot in this movie is simply incoherent. Why did Denzel turn himself in in the first place? Why does Reynolds pull a gun on local police officers? None of the actions of the major characters makes any sense, and the reveal doesn't help-- it just hopes that you didn't remember the first 20 minutes, I suppose, because it makes everything all the more illogical. Then, the big reveal just follows the now all too formulaic plot of most CIA oriented movies of the past decade or so. The action here is good, and the acting decent, but it can't make up for the writing."
1,"Do not stream, sound quality was horrible.",Careful. This is the first time I have had this problem.. he sound quality was so poor that I couldn't follow everything that was going on.
1,BORING,"If you have a bad case of insomnia, this movie will solve that. It is the most boring action film I've seen."
1,It was typical Hollywood,When I saw the Waterboading .. I said REALLY..Come on Hollywood.. everything is ANTI US..Hum instead of the CIA.. Why not make a movie about HOlder .. Fast and Furious?.. ya rightHollywood should get an extra Obamacare Tax.. for this one!
5,it's good,I thought it was good even if most professional reviewers hated it. Very exciting movie. I left the theatre saying it was better than the Bourne movies. The script is pretty tight and the acting is good.
3,Predictable,"2.5 stars.Odds are, you've probably figured out the plot before the movie starts. The story is chiche and been re-hashed in many other movies. What saves the movie is Denzel Washington (could be be any more awesome? I don't think so). Take him out, however, and this DVD is a waste of plastic.Still, if you are not picky about plot and like seeing car chases and explosions, then I'm sure you'll love this...Not recommended."
4,Please stop using amateur shaky cameras... PLEASE,"The movie was great. I really loved it except for the shaky camera work. Other than that the story was exciting. The cast was A1 and the action, very good. However, it was hard to see what the action really was because of the shaking and movement of the camera work."
4,A solid thriller.,"An infamous CIA agent who has been on the run for years suddenly appears and is overseen by a young agent trying to make a name for himself. Why did he disappear and why did he suddenly show up? These questions are answered in the midst of some of the most riveting action sequences in recent years. Fine acting and an intriguing story highlight one of the most solid action films we've seen. The excitement doesn't let up throughout, and the question of who are the ""good guys"" and who are the ""bad guys"" is ever-present. This one is very well-done."
3,Took an hour or so to really get going,"but then it took off like a shot. One of the best car chase scenes I've seen in the movies, and the end is superbly balanced."
5,Great Flick,I love Denezel in everthing I've seen him in and this was no exception. I loved this plot and the performance. Great flick!!
3,DECENT FILM,IT WAS A DECENT FILM. DENZEL DID HIS THING AS ALWAYS. THE PLOT COULD OF BEEN BETTER DEVELOPED. . IT STREAMED PERFECTLY WITH NO PAUSES OR SKIPS. I WILL CONTINUE TO USE AMAZON TO WATCH MOVIES AS WELL AS SHOWS.
4,Fun action movie.,Not high art but well done as an action flick and enjoyable. Feel free to spend a few dollars here.
1,BORING MOVIE...,"THIS ONE OF THE MOST BORING MOVIES, I'VE WATCHED IN A LONG TIME. IT STARTED AWFUL! IT'S BORING ME TO TEARS! I'M CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT IS OCCURRING. I'M DISAPPOINTED."
2,Wikileaks Fantasy,"The movie is relatively tired and formulaic, you can spot the 'traitor bad guy' fairly early on and it's just a standard spy/action movie. It's preachy as all hell about how terrible the intelligence community is, and involves a file that's very damaging to Western intelligence agencies. Basically, the movie is a fantasy about how awesome it would be if the wikileaks documents had made any actual impact in the world.Could have been a lot more interesting, there was ample opportunity for a more mental/psychological aspect to the movie with Denzel Washington's character; instead the movie takes a hard left turn and never comes back."
2,Safe House Hype,"Sorry my wife purchased this movie. Denzel is a great actor, but while watching the movie I had to check to see if we were having an earthquake or if I've had too much coffee. I almost got seasick watching this. The camera work is terrible, always shaking and moving all around. Maybe the camera people had too much coffee ? What were they hiding ? A poorly developed screen-play I guess.Characters are poorly developed. Even Denzel couldn't save this flick. Don't waste your time."
1,boring,This is one of the few movies I actually just turned off after about an hour. It's too yawningly predictable and the action is extremely typical and unimaginative. It's just another adrenaline flick with an overly simplistic plot.
4,Makes up for lack of originality,Pretty cool story if you didn't watch Bourne series. It's got a little Training day mixed in also.Great acting. DZ's perfect for the role cause it's a good combo of psychological and action thriller. CIA takes a pretty good beating once again. Unfortunate but entertaining.
1,Almost no story,"This movie had about 10-15 lines of actual dialogue. The rest was chase and fight scenes. The story held together for the first 10 minutes or so, but it completely fell apart once the random bad guys show up and start the movie long chase."
3,Not overly excited,Glad I waited for the DVD. Not what I expected with the actors involved. I guess they all can't be hits
3,Good Movie,It was a decent movie. Not the best I've seen from Denzel. I still enjoyed the movie though. Maybe wait until it comes on tv to watch it.
3,Run Guys Run!,Of course Denzel is always one step ahead of death and other mayhem. And the movie was very entertaining and had some interesting scenes.
3,Good Not Great,"The Blu-ray / DVD itself was in great shape. The movie itself, however, was not great. The movie plays a bit like Training Day meets Man On Fire, but with CIA agents. It drags a bit longer than it should. However, this is plenty of action and Reynolds and Denzel do their best to keep things interesting."
4,Fun movie night choice!,"This movie was good. Not the usual good for Denzel, but still good. This may have also been one of the best performances I have ever seen from Ryan Reynolds. Seriously, he was really good this time. The movie lags in a couple parts but the rest of it is the white knuckle thriller you paid to see. Maybe not worth a buy, but hands down worth the rent!"
2,Two Star RSVP,"Was looking forward to the usual thrills with Denzel at the helm, but this movie was all formula written with all the bells and whistles of an ice cream truck at the beach and requisite chase scenes, graphic gore, and body count amateurishly written for today's ADD audiences. First of all, Denzel has turned into The Mumbler - couldn't understand a thing he said several times even by turning up the sound. His presence always effuses a cool air, but he is kind of lame here. Then, there is the stone-cold-predictable Sam Shepard -one look at him, flashback to Swordfish, and VIOLA the plot is pre-solved. One enjoyable role was his Weston's sexy girlfriend. And that's about it. I rent it first then decide to buy the DVD. Not this one. Dean Corso"
3,You've seen this movie before,"You've seen this movie already, probably 50 times. While it wasn't boring, there was absolutely nothing unique or original about it. At this point, Denzel is going through the motions."
3,Good for this kind of movie,It was what you would except but it held your attention. I like the actors and so I rented the movie I was entertained.
4,Powerful drama,Typical story fo ex-CIA agent with someone inside the organization trying to get him. Denzel W. turns in superb performance. Scene in drug store is very memorable. Lots of shoot outs and stuff getting blown up: my kind of flick.
4,Confusing but good ...,"2012R: You gotta stay with this one to understand what's going on, but other than that it's good. A little pessimistic regarding the government, but that's not new! MFJLabs 3.5x"
3,Interesting and entertaining,This is entertaining but also forgetful. If your at home it will entertain you for the evening but you will probably never recall that you watched it.
2,A waste of amazing actors,"What a boring movie. The plot was average, the ending predictable and boring. I'm very sad to say they wasted Denzel's and Reynold's talents on this. There were so many pieces of this movie that were random and unexplained, and the whole plot - the thing about the list - was never really explained in detail. It was all too simple. I'm glad I used my free-Redbox-code on this, because it would have been a waste of money otherwise."
3,Bourne Out,"A movie with a lot of pace but not as much of a plot. Well acted and the cinematography is almost as good although a bit over the top with its lurid coloring. Scriptwriting and directing is competent at best. Those who write that this film isn't at the level of the Bourne trilogy are indeed not telling lies. A lot of rough edges in the script and the movie jerks about while the Bourne films flowed. The violence and consequences shown in the Bourne films are copied but not mastered. The film is dirty and grey-edged in feel but it doesn't come clean on ideas. Great acting from Washington, Reynolds, Farmiga, Shephard and especially from Brendan Glesson, one of my favorites. But the same care doesn't extend to the script or it's direction. The stadium scenes are among the best in recent action movies and rival those of the Bourne films but Safe House lags as it wheezes and gasps into the final chapter and fizzles at the end. Three stars."
4,good movie,It had a campy ending but it was an entertaining movie overall. Denzel has still got it. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
2,DVD not properly copied,"The movie packaging was excellent. The movie did not start with the menu screen as my other DVD movies. I had to manually select the ""movie parts"" so that my media player could run all in sequence.The movie was very good until I got to the 5th scene (The part where they are in the township with the containers and Denzel has to escape across the rooftops) when it suddenly switched to Spanish. My disappointment was such that I almost did not want to watch the remaining scenes, but it then switched back to English for the last two scenes.Should I return this DVD or should I just forget I ever saw it?Disappointed."
3,ok,Video not clear at times. A lot of buffering during play of the movie. Not the highest quality of video.
2,Couldn't open it,I am more reviewing the download than the movie itself. I purchased it but it never showed up in my que. Disapointed. Wasn't sure who to contact. Good thig it was an inexpensive purchase.
2,not what I expected,"Denzel awesome as usual no matter whether he is the good or bad guy - the rest of the cast just can't keep up ... very disappointed overall - this should have been a ""straight-to-DVD"" movie. Ryan just does not have a believable role as an action CIA operative although he is generally a very good actor - I just kept expecting him to crack a joke right in the middle of the action."
4,Very Entertaining,This is an action packed thriller about a rogue spy very much in the Bourne tradition. If you liked the Bourne movies you'll like this one too. The plot is pretty straight forward and does not have many surprises but the action sequences aer what make it worth watching. Enjoy!
2,a bit ridiculous,"We enjoy both of these actors, but feel the story got lost with all the fighting/action scenes...they went on and on and on....actually got up and did dishes waiting for a fight scene to get over- over the top..was disappointed."
2,Not a real memorable movie,"I got this for a weekend away with friends, and the guys liked it, but it seemed a bit grim and chaotic for me. I think Denzel was a bit too down right serious throughout, and the show just didn't grab me. I've seen him in better films. Fine for a space filler, though, on a long weekend with nothing to do."
4,Action drama leaves you wanting more.,"Film is well done having enough surprise twists to keep it interesting. The ending was less than satisfying. We all found ourselves rooting for Denzel, hoping that he was really a good guy and would be able to clear his name and survive."
2,More anti-American Hollywood tripe.,"This movie was good, REALLY good, right up until you learn that Denzel Washington's character became disillusioned because he had to kill a man who was going to testify to congress about ""black ops"" CIA ""Wet Works"" aka, assassinations. Typical Hollywood turns patriotism into sleaze and denigrates our country all in one scene.Action is good.Story is a little muddled, but keeps you watching to figure out what's happening.Acting is good.Holywood bashes America: without even asking Washington any pertinent questions, they imediately waterboard him.CIA are the bad guys here.If you want patriotic flag waving, proud to be an American fare, look somewhere else. As long as the left runs Holywood, America will continue to be something to be ashamed of and we will have garbage like this movie."
1,choppy and dependable,The first 45 minutes was choppy and the story line unsatisfactoryI say first 45 minutes because about that time I called it a day andfigured myself fortunate that it was a library copy and not $$$$$I also got very tired of Frost's mouth.Why Weston didn't gag him is beyond me. I would have.They just could NOT figure out how the thugs knew where Frost hadbeen taken. They watched him walk into the consulate and all they had to dowas set up surveillance but CIA could not figure it out?(((rolls eyes))))))There was so much of that.
3,A very dissappointing movie.,"This movie reminds me of Unbreakable. Two great actors who have proven to hollywood that they can act, but yet did not go the extra mile that they have done in past movies. I would give it five stars if this was the two actors first movie, but judging by their past movies, this has to be the worst movie that they have ever been in. This movie i would say, cable worthy, and maybe redbox worthy. As for going to buy it or going to the theaters to see it, you should ask for a refund."
2,"BORING, PREDICTABLE, UNORIGINAL","Shame on Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington signing on to do this movie... It was a predictable bore fest that had no entertainment value to speak of. I tried watching it a 2nd time and it was even worse. I think the Studio knew this and that's why they put it out 2 weeks early (but only to buy.) Denzel and Ryan are 2 of my favorite actors in all of hollywood, but they both deserve blame for giving half-assed efforts on a terrible script."
3,Wife Fell Asleep,"From Paris with Love is 5 star, this is 3.5 stars in the same genre. Good flick, not great. Lots of action. Nice anonymous type ending."
2,The Frost Identity done lite,"This movie screams Bourne Identity. They merely substituted actors and actresses. The sound track feels like a ripoff of John Powell's tracks. Think of the similarity to Joan Allen, Brian Cox, Albert Finney, and Chris Cooper--just uncanny. And, as in the Bourne Trilogy the movie is chase with little dialog that makes any sense.'Safe House' is a good Saturday afternoon diversion and not much else."
2,Meh,Just nothing unexpected. Glad I rented and didn't buy. 2 stars instead of 1 because of decent action scenes with 1 cool explosion.
5,Pete's pic.,Very very very good movie...All good actors I would see it againAnd recommend this movie to others.And I probably will watch it again but I definitely recommend it.
4,Action packed,Lots of action!!! Denzel played a great role. First time streaming a movie from amazon and the quality was good.
3,Decent Action Flick,"I thought this movie was adequate at the time, but even though it's only been a few months since I watched it, I honestly can't remember too much about it, like how it ends."
3,Review for this movie,"I thought the movie was ok, I exspected more from this movie.The movie was kinda slow and didnt have the suspence I was looking for. The previews were good but over all the movie wasnt as good as I thought"
5,Really enjoyed it!,"What can I say other than it was definitely action filled. Once the ""chase"" was on, literally on the edge of your seat. Really happy we purchased the movie."
4,Another great Denzel movie,"We were happy to add this movie to our Denzel Washington collection. We found the storyline a little painful. It's not a pretty movie, and the 'good guy'; and 'bad guy' lines are at times blurred. Yet, it's gritty presentation seems probably more real than we'd like to admit. All in all, it kept me guessing a few times and provided thought-provoking entertainment."
5,Love it!,This is another Denzel masterpiece! Another violent movie and exciment and Ryan Reynolds kills it in this action packed thriller!!
4,Worth watching,good movie with interesting twists. Denzel is great as always and Ryan Reynolds delivers a surprising good performance. I can recommend this movie.
5,As Good As Real,Love the movie very real and very interesting to watch. I will recommend anyone who like detective movie to purchase this one. It will surprise you.
4,Good purchase for the collection,"Excellent movie, not an 100% original in the plot, but still a great thrill seekers pleasure. I like the suspense and the surpise."
3,Predictable,The movie quality was great. Amazon instant video is a great service. The prices are a bit high compared to Red Box but you do get the movies the same day that they come out. The film was good but predictable.
3,Longer renting policy,"This movie was pretty good the whole 45 minutes i watched it, wish the renting policy was for at least 2 days :/"
3,Ryan Reynolds is now complete.,"Fairly typical Hollywood formula script, but the acting of ""D"" Dub and the breakout performance by Ryan Reynolds make this a worthy movie to watch. RR expanded his talents with a decent performance in ""Buried"" but in ""Safe House"" he took it to a new level and has finally arrived as a ""5 tool"" multi-talented star. This performance combined with his RomCom and Drama skills should put RR on track to become the next Brad Pitt or Denzel. Looking forward to seeing him in other good roles that display his new found acting depth. The movie story was ""meh"", but the pace of the action sequences was strong and the gritty acting by the entire cast was ""super"". Overall, not bad thanks to the performances from ""D"" Dub and Ryan Reynolds."
3,Ultraviolet FAIL............,The movie is great...No issues with playing discs. The only reason I purchased this particular Combo pack was because it included the Ultraviolet digital copy. The problem was that the Ultravoilet code was expired by the time I received the product (it expired a few months before I even ordered the movie). There was no indication of this in the product details so I had no way of knowing this before purchasing.
2,Mindless Action Flick,"The cast was way too good for the writing and editing in this movie. The plot was so thin, I can't believe that stars like DW, RR, VF, et al. would agree to be in this. Didn't they read the script beforehand? On the other hand, if you're a guy that enjoys a mindless, shoot 'em up, violent, car chase-filled action flick with very little plot, no character development and poor editing, then you'll enjoy this movie."
4,Washington/Reynolds a good tandem,"I started watching this movie with a bias in its favor to begin with. I like both, Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington so I was expecting it to be good. The movie was as advertised. A good thing you can expect from a Denzel crime/action thriller is that the acting will be good and the action won't be over the top. There will be enough action to keep you locked in but not so much where you mentally check out and don't care about the story. This wasn't the best Denzel movie, but at least it had a good cohesive story and some substance."
1,INSIDE SEAMS SCRATCH THE CD,The manufacturer could have easily glued the seams outside the envelope but the way they designed these Burlington envelopes scratches the cds as you slide them in and out. A poorly conceived product.
2,Harder to use than other types,"For a reason that completely eludes me, the manufacturer decided to go against the mainstream and glue the flaps on the inside of the envelope. All other brands are glued on the outside. The main disadvantage is that CDs are harder to insert into the envelopes: they tend to get stuck between the imperfectly glued flaps and the back of the envelope. This design also offers less protection to the CD, as the flaps rub harder against it when sliding it in or out, and may even scratch it a bit. Other than that, the envelopes are okay, but the only reason why you'd buy these instead of the cheaper Fellowes product is the shipping cost."
2,Poorly constructed,"As others have said, the side flaps should be glued on the OUTSIDE of the envelope. It's very annoying when you're trying to insert CDs because they get caught between the side flap and the back of the envelope. Bad design."
2,faded,It was in good condition when it got here but I've had it for a couple of months now and the sun is causing it to fade. The lettering now looks like it has been through the wash a few too many times.
5,MC.EIHT HAS DONE IT AGAIN!,"GEEH!WHAT'S UP TRUE MC.EIHT FANS,THIS IS D.L REPORTING OUT OF SHREVEPORT,LA.I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING MC.EIHT SINCE HIS FIRST DEBUT""ONE TIME GAFFLE EM UP""ABOUT 11 YEARS AGO,AND I CAN TRULY SAY FROM HIS FIRST RELEASE TO HIS RECENT ""THE LAST MAN STANDING""HE HAS DONE NOTHING BUT PROGRESSED,MY FAVORITE TRACKS ARE 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,13,14,16,17AND 18.WELL I GUESS YOU CAN SAY THE WHOLE CD.I'M A TRUE MC.EIHT FAN AND THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF HIS BEST ALBUM,EVEN THOUGH I LIKE ALL OF THEM.GEEH! I'M OUT."
2,eiht's worst album,eiht was trying to revamp his image he was'nt too happy about this album he admitted he did'nt like it he was mad at the label and made sure this album sucked cause he wanted out of his contract and wanted to quit rapping he was also shocked over the cderaths of 2pac and biggie 2 artists who eiht personally knew anyway dj muggs from cypress hill produced the majority of this cd but it does'nt work the only song I like on here is can i get mine the rest of the album sucks good thing eiht made better material on his later albums.
4,Last Man Standing,When I recieved this Cd I was in mint condition. Thank you for your time & patience in this matter.
5,Willie Nelson,These are two of Willies best albums. I have these in the old records and was glad to see them out on cd's.To Lefty from willie is my all time favorite album of Willies.
3,sharp flea comb,"I am an avid flea comber for our 2 cats (DSH) and short-haired dog. I can be a bit vigorous at times chasing down those pesky fleas. The tines on this comb were a bit too sharp and thin, and would actually bend and break off while I combed, scratching the poor critters. They would cringe or just run & hide when they saw me reach for it. I finally tossed it and bought one with shorter tines and more rounded tips. The pets seem pleasantly surprised. If you're a vigorous comber, watch out."
1,Stay Away!!!!,"This is a horrible textbook that is very confusing. Unless you are very interested in micro-electro mechanical systems, you will feel like throwing this book out of the window. The authors are always talking about their boring research and do not provide you with any decent examples. It's as bad as they come."
2,Down in front? no one can see it. who cares.......,I purchased this screen with high hopes of being able to see my projection in medium light but I guess I should have looked at the viewing angle more closely.When they said that it was a 15 degree viewing angle I did not estimate how high my projector is off the ground.I guess I thought the high power would be better. It looks great if I stand on my couch.Otherwise it is like looking at someone else's laptop. Only buy if you like standing while watching a movie. Or you live in a galaxy without a sun.Guess my 1500 lumens sony projector wasnt enough. Might need a 8000 lumen theather digital projector for this.P.S. Amazon shipping is the best around.
3,Preliminary impression,"As a psychiatrist I have not heard previously the strongly positive reviews a borderline patient gave this book. Explaining the psychodynamic process to patients is difficult, and now I have a reference for them. I am ordering the book now to use as a reference."
3,Jewish music...,"This CD is good for those who like clarinet music. There are a few annoying songs, but besides that it is OK. I give it 3 stars, no more, no less. I apologize for not having any comments, but I guess all you can do is buy it and see what it's all about for yourself."
4,Puppet Mouth ingenious fun,"When I first got this book, I didn't really enjoy reading it to my 13 month old because the words are supposed to be a song and no tune is supplied. (The words don't rhyme so a tune would have been helpful.) Nonetheless, my daughter loved the puppet concept even then and now, at 21 months, she INSISTS that we read this book EVERY DAY. She wants the cow to kiss her with the cow lips, the donkey to bite her with the donkey mouth and the animals all to say their sounds with their mouths moving. There are a lot of clever interesting things to be described in the illustrations that you notice more and more as you read the book. So now, even though I don't find the words great, it is clear that the puppet and the illustrations are what my daughter cares about and this book is her absolute favourite (and she has a lot of books!)"
5,fun and interactive,I have bought this as a gift more than once and it is always a big hit with the preschool crowd. It is a toy and a book combined; it is fun for the child to move the puppet on their own as well as when the grown-up does it!
3,My kids love it...,"OK, I'm the only one to be giving this book fewer than four stars, but let me explain:First of all, all three of my kids think this book is hilarious, most of all my preschooler. The concept is clever and entertaining; the pictures are well-done and funny.Why I gave it three stars instead of four or five: The puppet hurts my wrist. In order to hold the book at angle where I can see the words, it strains my wrist. I don't have any previous wrist problems, but I swear if I read this every day I'd end up with carpal tunnel syndrome or something of the like. Also, although it's supposed to be a song, I can't figure out the rhythm at all. It just doesn't flow. I wish the authors would post a video of themselves performing the book so we would know how it's supposed to go!"
3,Intense Workout,"This is a very intense workout. However, I found it to be very difficult on the back and knees. Almost all of the ""buns"" workout is done in a squat position. Also, inner thighs and outer thighs are not worked, which I expected as part of a ""buns"" routine. I still prefer the original ""Buns of Steel"" workout to this portion of this DVD."
1,Completey Unimpressed,"I knew this workout would be a disappointment when the ""warm up"" consisted of watching four Amazonian women running on the spot for five minutes. The premise of the ""supersets"" is simple enough and it introduces absolutely no new exercises. Definitely not worth it."
1,"great name, horribel video","the name got my attention, but the foreign women joggin made me sick, tis was a terrible video, dont waste your money."
4,Excellent resource book,Excellent resource book for any one training ESL teachers or for future teachers of ESL.
5,"Kaiser Bakeware Kaisercast Domus Bundform Pan, 3-Cup Capacity","i had been wanting these pans for a long time and finally justified buying them to make some little cakes for a church bake sale.they are really nice heavy pans , worth the extra $ and i wish i had not waited so long to buy them!"
4,Funny tidbits,"This is a fun book to flip through. It is divided into sections based on topic, so its easy to navigate. Would make a great gift for someone who knows it all and can appreciate the humor."
1,"Misinformation, Misquotations, and Bad Sources","When a book claims to be ""definitive"" AND ""authoritative"" one might expect some level of accuracy and even a broadcast-quality fact checking. These authors use second and third party sources when inaccurately quoting reputable figures, even when primary sources are easily available. In three instances I researched, they claimed to ""quote"" from a book that has NO SUCH QUOTE! I own the source book and found it nowhere between the covers.I was appalled at the extent to which this method is used in _The Experts Speak_, ultimately leading to the spreading of misinformation--not the cataloging of it. I personally checked the book for persons and subjects familiar to me to find that 3 of 4 quotes were both innacurate and the sources were mislabeled AND misquoted. The problem is so widespread, and the resulting misinformation seems designed to support a political agenda of the authors. Buy at your own risk."
1,lame,"This book is a waste of time and money. The dates are wrong, the facts are wrong, the quotations have selected items omited in order to increase dramatic effect which distorts what was quoted in the first place. There has been much better ""expert-speak"" documented throughout history but it's not in this book. Why? Save your money and leave this one on the shelf."
2,Not What I Expected,"This book is not what I expected. It is gossipy and shallow. I was hoping for some insight into the early history of the craft revival, or perhps impressions of what it is like to run a long-established coven, the lifetime experience of being High priestess. Stories abourt how Crowther's cats lived and died, for example, do not fit the bill. (Goddess knows I love cats as much as anyone, but still.) Buy this book only if you are a completist, or have an obsessive interest in the early British Craft scene."
4,Scholarly and Upbeat,"I definitely like this book as a classic Chinese interpretation over the highly touted Wilhelm one. If I spelled his name right. The author is very sincere and includes a lot of information that, as you learn about your life and what's happening in it, can be illuminated. A lot of description about the ancient icons that accompany the interpretation. Alfred Huang gets you in the mindset of the ancient Chinese and the contributors to the I-Ching."
3,An Interesting Alternative,"I used the Wilhelm translation for years until the book got so beat up that I had to trash it. This is an interesting alternative, but I still prefer Wilhelm. There's too much space devoted here to analyzing the the structure of the hexagram. And the different sources of material that are integrated into the text are put together in a somewhat confusing way. In general, it's a nice alternative, but I'd still go to Wilhelm first. I think most people will find Wilhelm more accessible.One thing you discover if you compare translations is that the original text can mean MANY things. That's part of the beauty of this book."
2,"hook, line, and sinker","Everyone here seems to have bought the line that the author and publisher are selling them -- that this is somehow a ""definitive"" translation, simply because the author isn't a Westerner. This is a blatant appeal to authority fallacy if I ever heard one. The fact is that being an Asian and a Taoist master doesn't make one a good translator, and this good is proof of that. Frankly, it is riddled with errors. For an example of a review by someone who REALLY knows what they are talking about, see:http://biroco.com/yijing/karcherhuang.htmabout halfway down the page, after the review of Karcher's book.In the meantime, please save yourself the money and invest in a truly good translation, such as Richard Lynn's."
1,Do not buy this book!,"Based on the two reviews I bought this book and was highly disappointed. The author confuses the reader by providing way too much irrelevant information. Moreover, the style is quite poor. There are much better books about Ireland, e.g. by Connolly."
5,Best Triscuit Ever!!,"Not into Triscuits until I tasted these rosemary olive oil crackers at a party with a cream cheese cranberry dip. I love them!! They are now a part of my lunch everyday. Not only that, they fill you up because of the fiber. great product."
4,Faber-Castell Watercolor set,The seller did as promised and was here before the due date which wasgood so I could mail to grand son ..
5,Great for drawing,"Our granddaught loves to draw, and this is one of the things she really wanted and loved it when she opened it....."
2,Too small,This dictionary is of decent quality but is too concise to be of any use other than carrying with you as an emergency aid while in Croatia.
3,Not complete,"Hi, I have universal croatian dictionary which is a good dictionary but I need a complete course for biginners - croatian english. You have srbocroatian comlete course for biginners from David Norris and that is ok but he should have a new book just for croatian-english (teach yourself). It would be nice to have that. Maybe a book like that will be out sometime. Thank you! Mrs. Doyle"
5,Excellent resource.,"This is unsurpassed for a pocket dictionary. I have found few English/Croatian dictionaries to be as accurately translated or as in depth. Not perfect, but highly recommended -- and easy to carry around with you."
4,Great for on-the-fly communication in Serbo-Croat,"Just got back from Bosnia where this dictionary was absolutely indispensable. Ideal for people that already have some knowledge of the Serbo-Croat/ Croatian/ Bosnian/ whatever-you-wanna-callit language. Not to be confused with a phrasebook for travellers.PROS: 1) Small. Fits in your pocket. Any pocket. 2) Comprehensive. Has 95% of the words you encounter in everyday conversation, and 90% of the words you encounter in writing. 3) Durable. The plastic cover is flexible, making it quick and easy to flip pages, while being tough and water resistant.CONS: 1) I've bought a few of them, and sometimes they're missing the 'S' thru 'T' section of the Croatian. 2) Sometimes the shade of meaning for a word is not clear. 3) The dictionary does not indicate eastern or western variants of words. A native speaker is the only one that can tell you which of the listed synonyms they use.All in all, you have to have this if you're trying to communicate on the fly."
2,Insensitive presentation,"Since the breakup of Yugoslavia, the trend of Serbian and Croatian, or Serbo-Croatian, if you please, has been conscious differentiation. The lexicon is sensitive: words like ""bread"" ""hleb"" vs ""kruh"" are ethnically charged. This dictionary has no accounting for that whatsoever and can place the user in awkward positions. (As I experienced first-hand while travelling in the area.) The dictionary favors the Serb variations. Furthermore, the dictionary lacks several words and explanations of others. This is a great brand for Western Languages, but is not at all thorough enough for the sensitive speaker of Serbian and Croatian."
3,So-so,"This book is good for translating basic words and phrases. It is difficult to learn conversational Bosnian from this book, but I can pick out words. I work with a dozen or so Bosnians and they have helped me with my pronunciation. Bosnian-Croatian-Sebian languages are difficult to learn on your own. This book is convenient, my copy is very beat up from carrying it around in my pocket forever. It would be in your best interests to partner this book with a native speaker if available."
2,Bullet-stopper!,I was in a course to learn Serbian-Croatian and we were given this dictionary. One of my teachers used to say that this was only good for a bullet-stopper. If you are a serious student of Serbian/Croatian/Bosnia I would recommend one of the Morton Benson dictionaries and the Magner introductory course to the languages.
4,Actually works with Vista,"I have had zero problems with this software. It works with Vista, it does what it promises and the instructional videos are actually helpful. I am satisfied."
1,pointlessly difficult software,"I have the Cakewalk Music Creator software and thought I'd ""upgrade"" to the Sonar 6 XL. What a mistake! The Music Creator program works just fine, while the Sonar 6 XL has fancy bells and whistles it's much harder to access the elements that make my Music Creator program (bought in 2003) so intuitive and easy to use. As with most software made these days the manual and online tutorials are convoluted and not at all user friendly. I uninstalled the Sonar 6 XL after several frustraing hours trying to get a handle on the program, and I am glad to be rid of it. I am not a Luddite by any means. But I have no use for ""upgrades"" that provide only frustration and no results when the older version of the software was just fine."
5,Top 5 of the funniest movies I have seen,This is a truly funny movie. The main character is so out of her element that it is totally belivable how ridiculous she is. This is one of those movies that you buy and come back to watch and invite your friends over for movie night. It's a good buy for your DVD collection
4,saving grace,I thought this was a fun film. Didn't have to concentrate watching the plot unfold. Scenery lovely and overall good film for a wet day. Made me feel good.
1,Saving Grace,Saving Grace DVD I did not realize that I would not be able to play it in USA with our normal equipment.
3,Good Plot -- Wonderful Comedy for the first hour,"Yes there is a classic scene in this great plot movie where a good traditional fancy for tea in that British manner gets a rip-roaring suprise! Amazon editorial was quite generous in stating that the end of the movie was over the top. Fact of the matter is, the end was not original at all, I could not remember where I had seen that scene before, but it had been done before. As a matter of fact while searching for a new movie on Amazon, I crossed an old Mel Brooks film I had seen, ""History of the World part one"", that shed light on my recollection. A pity, the comedy had its own legs to stand on for the most of it."
3,Typical British comedy,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Monty Python fan, and I also enjoyedWaking Ned. Saving Grace starts out OK, but it quickly deterioratesto typical British comedy - half the movie is like watching a musicvideo, with songs accompanying Grace and Matthew growing cannabis.There's also a senseless ending. And of course, your typical heavyaccented leading character (Matthew), and a friendly small villagein the country. This comedy brought a few smiles to my face, but nothingmore."
1,It will not play in my dvd player,"HI, the dvd saving grace did not work in my dvd player or any my friend dvd players, the dvd is from the UK and i'mwondering the format is not made for dvd players in the US.. When I received it in the mail, it was loose in the case.So do I sent the dvd back amazon to get one made for the US dvd Players, just get my money back?????Kindest Regards,Nancy"
1,DVD Would not play in USA,"This movie is a family favorite, so I ordered it for a family get together. When we tried to play the DVD, is came up with the error, ""incorrect region code"". Our tecky teens figured out that you had to live somewhere near the Vatican in order to view the movie. It seems to me that checking for the region code before shipping would be a no brainer. Amazon needs to have a chat with this vendor. Very disappointed....guess this is a ""BUYER BEWARE"" lesson...no more DVD's from Amazon!!!!"
3,British Humor,"Funny circumstance in saving the estate of Grace lead to a wonderful British farce. Not for younger kids because of the Pot issue, but adults should gets some good laughs out of this one...."
4,Saving Grace,"I have seen this movie before and it is a hilarious tell well written and well acted by Craig Ferguson. Unfortunately for me I didnt realize it wouldnt play in my American DVD player. ALthough it specified Region 2, at the time I bought it there was not an description of what that meant like there is now."
4,A simple surprise of a movie,"The setting of the movie is in the English province of Cornwall, which is the most southwest corner of U.K. Most of the filming is done in the very small fishing village of Port Isaac. Having visited Port Isaac I can grandly attest the area is beyond beautiful, unspoiled by progress and the people are just as friendly as the characters in ""Saving Grace."""
5,great movie,"Everyone has given great reviews, but they all seem to be missing one key point. Craig Ferguson's character is a handyman, not a gardner. If he was a gardener that he wouldn't need Grace's help. Just a small point, but a key one. Cheers"
4,"fun, fun & more fun!",We had seen it before and a few of the gags stuck in our heads. We had to see it again. I'm sure it will be watch again. Great fun for us baby boomers.
5,fell over laughing,This movie is fall-out-of-your-chair funny. A must for Craig Ferguson and Brenda Blethyn fans.
4,Hillarious,"This movie is absolutely funny, you will laugh to death. It's the story of a woman that goes broke and starts growing marihuana in order to pay her debs."
5,"A must see, touching, funny and totally fun",This is such a wonderful and enjoyable movie. It has something for everyone. I have recommended this to many friends and they all have agreed that it is fantastic. We all have our favorite parts and laugh when we recall them. It is great to have a movie that you feel good about when it is over. I'm still chuckling!!!!
5,Saving Grace,Craig Ferguson's best movie ever; absolutely halarious! It has a great story and the acting is terrific. One of my favorite comedies.
4,I rented it - now I want it for my own!,"I rented it because I love Craig Ferguson and love even more Martin Clunes. Clunes is a delightful secondary character - Ferguson is a hoot! It's funny, surprising, the acting is convincing and as in any British film, the scenery is a character in itself. I agree with another reviewer that the ending is a bit ""over the top"", but I wanted to see a happy ending come about. I didn't expect it to come the way it did, and that's always a pleasant surprise when watching a film."
5,Laughed So Hard My Face Hurt,This is one of my Favorite Movies.Shot on Location in the UK its GREAT Entertainment.This movie will have everyone in stiches.It was a must for our Collection and well worth it.Amazon Prime the only way to go.Shopping from home never gets any better than this.M.A.FLICK
4,Heartwarming story,"I love Craig Ferguson and it was a joy to see this move effort. It is a charming story about how a well-loved village member is helped to survive after the death of her husband. If you are used to the late-night Craig Ferguson, seeing him in this movie will surprise and charm you."
2,Rubbish!,"This strains credibility, even for a lighthearted movie. How so many people enjoyed this frivolous romp through silliness astounds me. Maybe they were all high-that seems likely. Like other comedies from this part of the world that balance drama and comedy, this was just a comedy that over the top. It's just stupid, actually. For good entertainment, try Brassed Off, Intermission, On a Clear Day, Once Upon a Time in the Midlands, The Full Monty, Trainspotting, Or Lock, Stock, & Two Smoking Barrels. Hard to believe the two leading characters got involved with this mess."
1,Saving Grace,Hi there seems to be a problem with this item I didin't get the dvd in the box. The others are in perfect shape. What shall I do? could do you send it to Mexico? I believe a bought it new so I do not understand why this happened. Thank you and hoping I will get a respond soon.Jennifer Morel
4,A delight in pot comedy,"Think of those wacky British comedies from the past, then think of Cheech and Chong. Mix them together and you have this marvel- Saving Grace. It is a very funny comedy that is one of the best pot comedies ever, right up there with the old C & C movies and Half Baked.Grace is played by Brenda Blethyn, as usual a delight, who is a widow who is about to lose her house. Until a gardener (Craig Ferguson from the Drew Carey Show, who also co wrote/produced this movie) gets her in a scheme to grow hemp in her greenhouse. The climax is uproariously funny (the two tea drinking lades steal they're scene) as well is much of the rest of the film. Even if the there are some un-needed side plots, the film is must see."
5,"Fabulous Movie, Fast Delivery.",A good price for this video and it arrived in just a few days in perfect condition. Thank You Very Much.
3,take his advice,not sure what's so special about it. i must admit i'm just a casual Oasis fan and it's not a bad cd but after about 5 listens it's pretty forgetable for the most part. the quality of sound/recording doesn't help.(mines an import) but if your a big fan it might be worth it.
5,Extremely good journey,"Maybe this plodded along a bit, maybe it's been done before. But, by the movie's end, and everything is pieced together, it was a gem. I especially liked the three main leads Smith, Johnson and Brewster, although, I would have liked to have seen the relationship between Smith and Brewster wrapped up a little bit more tidy.I realize the movie title was pretty much taken verbatim from the book, but, it may have distracted from this movie getting better circulation and response from the general public. It certainly has an indie feel to it, but, that's what makes many indies little gems.I really indentified with the characters(not the dad) and I'm a 59 year old male!! I rented this, but, I will buy this movie for my permanent collection."
3,Coming of age movie,I bought the Ural sidecar rig that was used in the movie and purchased the dvd to go with the poster and to see the Ural on the small screen.
3,Jordana Brewster is in it!,"I bought this sight unseen as a used DVD. I have always been a fan of Jordana Brewster ever since seeing her in ""The Fast & The Furious.""If you are a guy who likes guy movies, you will like this.I was glad I took a chance and bought this DVD. I bought ""The Invisible Circus"" from Amazon for the same reason I bought this DVD."
1,"AVOID this ""remastered"" edition...","Of course, that ""one star"" rating couldn't be for the musical quality of this great record which I could easily rate ""5 stars"" and probably you are reading this review not to know how good this record is but just to see if this ""remastered"" issue is worth. Well, I hope you can learn from my review and other reviews on the web that as surprising as it maybe, this 1998-1999 Sting reissues does not do any justice to the original recordings and somehow they have made it to sound worst. As I love this album I just tought it could be great to hear it in a better version. I read some reviews telling that this album, the Soul Cages and The Dream were ruined by the remastering but couldn't resist from buying this version. Well, I deeply regret it. The sound of this remastering is WEAK, DULL and they have removed almost of low frequencies. It's really a shame. You are better off buying the other versions and NO THIS ONE."
2,no help here,"Took two a day for a few weeks...no noticeable positive effect. I am rating it a two stars though just because upon a cold turkey discontinuing of use, I have had some breakouts, acne. So clearly it does something...just not what I hoped.I have learned lately that I have Hashimoto's. There has been so much written about the need for ioding for thyroid function, BUT, If you have Hashimoto's watch out for ANY form of iodine. Iodine will trigger the immune system into destroying the thyroid."
2,product is ok,"didnt like the company it came from they were VERY slow, its like they lost the order at one point"
1,Useless,Utterly useless. Its like taking tic tacs. No benefit to me whatsoever. Absolute waste of money. It may work for someone else but I would never buy again.
2,No Results!,This product is not all it's advertised to be. I noticed no difference when taking it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
5,OVER THE COUNTER MIRACLE,"After 3-4 years of NO success from taking various doctor prescribed thyroid medications, I found this awesome product. My hair stopped falling out in clumps, my chills have subsided, weight has been dropping steadily and I no longer have that ""black cloud over my head"" emotion draining my energy! Try this product 3 times a day for one month and you will experience the positive results, too!"
3,Not Vegetarian Formula,The product advertised as Vegetarian Formula however I received Now With Real Thyroid Formula. The company issued me a credit.
3,Eh...,"Hard to say... No noticeable difference, but at three tablets per day, one box is only a 20 day supply. So far, I'm not willing to invest in a second box."
2,I'm halfway through the box and...,"They're not really working for me.. Still have cold hands and feet and all other thyroid like symptoms after taking them. They taste extremely sweet (like a sugar pill) and fall apart easily, almost like an aspirin.. These seem more like placebos than a medication or supplement. I read the placebo affect may work for some people, but thyroid conditions are serious.. You should be taking medicine that will help you get better, not make you 'think' you are getting better. I'm going to finish out the remainder of the box to see if anything changes."
2,Didn't do much of anything for me :-(,"In another attempt to self treat my hypo, i tried these based on the amount of good reviews. I took 2 a day for a few weeks and got nothing out of it. I was still freezing all the time (temp always around 96.2) and i noticed it made my arms and muscles hurt REALLY bad. It was like i could feel it moving through my veins, it was really weird. It was bothersome enough to have me in bed by 7pm most nights. Anyway, after a few weeks i stopped taking them. They just weren't the supplement for me. They do do SOMETHING though as i did notice a change when i took them... just not a good one. They do taste good though, very sweet."
3,mother,Guess they are not working on me yet have not been taking them for long so nothing bad or good to say about the product.
3,The service was great.,Dear sir your service is very good the tape is good shape I just did not like the film.I picked it my mistake.
4,Snow White in Seventies Vega$,Elizabeth Taylor is still so fetching in 1970 ugly decor Vegas and Warren Beatty is already so mature that there's no dissonance caused by the age difference. This is a nice intimate relationship movie similar in the claustrophobic voyeurism of Salma Hayek and Russell Crowe's tiny relationship movie - Breaking Up and Jean Limosin's Novo. I think this type of movie should be called Entre Nous because it's about the connection between two people eating toast and reading the newspaper in a painful everything instantly freshens but not at all like When Harry Met Sally type movies.
2,Recommend you pass on this one.,"I bought the CD Label Kit, which includes the design software, and I am pleased with the labels. Hey, what can go wrong with a label except that it doesn't stick? But, the software packaged with the Burlington was a pain to use. It was not user- friendly, has no print documentation and the help is paltry to say the least. I searched for twenty minutes trying to change the fonts. Something that basic should not be that hard. And the provided templates are mediocre, bordering on funky. The graphics used for the templates often looks like something out a 1998 clip-art program.Bottom line: If I had to do it over again, I buy a different CD Label Kit. I recommend you pass on this one. Conditionally Recommended"
1,Never again from this vendor...,"Software won't install. Calling the vendor doesn't help, all you get is a recorded message that says that the voice mailbox is full, or you get redirected to another number which disconnects or puts you in another mailbox. What happened to people?... After searching the web for the better part of 4 hours, I ended up purchasing label printing software from another source. I am extremely unhappy and dissatified...Never again from this vendor... I did not get what I paid for, or what I was led to believe was a quality product.I could have purchased label stock from the local Kmart, I NEEDED A WORKABLE SOFTWARE....Leon SmithNew Brighton, PA"
5,ANOTHER LOST GEM,"Published in the early 1950s this is a novel of the survival of a group of children caught in the Dutch Floods of 1953. Is is a true story of survival. A fictional account this may be, but the research is great and the writing quite realistic. This is Hartog's third novel published in this country and is probably the best of the lot. It takes a few pages to get into the flow of the author's syntax but it is well worth the effort. This is one of those books that has been out of publication for awhile which is a pity as folks are missing quite a good read."
2,"Okay for a ""chick-flick"" but slow-moving.","Kelly McGillis and Adrian Pasdar are both beautiful and spell-binding to watch as always. The plot is interesting but this is a very slow-moving romantic-novel type film. It comes across like a stereotypical ""chick-flick."""
5,GREAT mini-series,"If you like good movies and mini-series, you will really like this one. It has a great cast and excellent acting. I couldn't stop watching it and I think you'll love it too."
4,MINI SERIES SUCKER,"Length:: 1:53 MinsMy name is Frankie Delmane- writer, singer, performer, verbal hustler- I publish a junk culture zine called TRASH. This is my first of what I hope to many many more reviews. Look out for me everywhere!Captains and the Kings"
5,The Captains and The Kings,"I first saw this mini-series when I was 11. Even though it was a little adult for me at the time, I knew it was one of my favorites. Richard Jordan, Perry King and Blair Brown became some of my favorite actors because of this mini-series. In my opinion, it rates with Rich Man Poor Man and North and South, parts 1 and 2. They don't make mini-series like The Captains and the Kings anymore and I highly recommend it. I am so glad I bought it and watched it after 20+ years."
1,You are better off watching paint dry!,"God it is awful. The rags to riches story of a immigrant is an intereting angle but it is overshadowed by hours of cheap melodrama about things that might be considered a scandal in the 19th century but just make you yawn now. There is a lot of yearning by a young man for a married woman and then later illicit love affairs between in-laws and people of mixed race from the south. A pregnant woman even falls down the stairs in slow motion after being pushed by her drunken husband. I knew she was going to lose the baby the moment she started walking up the stairs towards the man. The main charactrer spends a lot of time covering up illegitemate children to protect his irish sons political career. Gee could their be a parallel to a real life family in the USA, think hard. Save your money, vacum your carpet and then admire the straight lines on the floor."
1,Disappointed,"The boxed set was incomplete. It did not have all of episodes or chapters in the set. There should have been 9 or 10 tapes in the set, but only had 5. Tape 1&2 were chapters 1&2 but Tape 3 was chapter 4, Tape 4 was chapter 6, and Tape 5 was chapter 8. so when you buy this set you do not get to view the entire mini-series and you do not even get the final episode."
2,Disappointed,"Based upon the reviews at Amazon, my wife and I decided to watch this series. We were hopeful it would be as good as some of the Masterpiece Theatre and BBC stuff. After the first few minutes, I sensed that we might be in trouble. Thinking it might get better, and for my wife's interest, I perservered to the end of part one. When it was over, we both looked at each other and agreed, that was enough. The acting seemed stiff and wooden and unpleasant. Furthermore, the dialogue did not seem to help or be conducive to the acting either. Overall, it appeared to be too much of a contrived and glorified soap opera with no grittiness or heart, just slick, formulaic script. Good literature, or movies, makes you care about the characters. Here, all I cared about was getting it over."
3,historical drama,"Irish boy makes good, but what a price. Good story, but you knew what was coming next and the dialogue was less than good. The sets and costumes were great and the acting fair, probably due to the poor directing. These were first impressions - sometimes it's better when you view it again. As usual, Charles Durning stood out; a great character actor."
5,Captains and the Kings,"I have watched for a rerun of this mini-series on television for years. I was so excited to find it. Many times after watching an ""old"" movie or TV series, I find it really wasn't as good as I remembered it. NOT SO with Captains and the Kings. After 25 years, it is still one of the best!"
5,Captains and the Kings,"I received this very quickly. I have yet to watch it but I remember how great it was when it appeared on the Best Sellers series on NBC back in the day. Told as only good stories should be told, in mini series format, it is filled with excitement, romance, danger, etc. Richard Jordan is simply excellent and was born to play the role of Joseph Armagh. For those of you that enjoy very well written and superbly acted period pieces with timeless themes, I highly recommend Captains and the Kings."
5,Finally!!!,"For years, I have been searching for a video release of 'Captains and the Kings' based on the novel by Taylor Caldwell. I was barely a teenager when I saw the miniseries on television and immediately fell in love with the richness of characterization, the detailed scenery, and the straightforward, yet convoluted plotline. Richard Jordan, Charles Durning, Henry Fonda, Perry King, Blair Brown, Vic Morrow, Joanna Petit, Patty Duke ... to name but a few. The casting was impressive. The story riveting. I've worn out three copies of the book and just purchased number 4. Don't miss it!"
2,DISAPPOINTED!!! NOT LIKE THE BOOK AT ALL!!!!!!!,"The only good part about this was the actors. It has a very complimentary cast, but I do not like how some of the main characters are portrayed, mainly Joseph Armagh. In the book he is a cold, conceited, cynical, and cruel man. In the movie he smiles all the time, is jovial, and is far to happy for his depiction. The story line doesn't even follow the book hardly AT ALL which is very disappointing. I loved the book for the story, and this movie is a whole different story than what I read. Many characters are also added in that were not in the book, and the reasoning is beyond me. I was not happy as a huge fan of the book, and I don't know if I'll ever finish this after just completing the first of three disks. HORRIBLE! If you liked the book, you'll hate this movie."
3,No closed captioning,"I received my order promptly and in good condition.....but, no closed captioning....my husband is nearly deaf and is so dissapointed."
2,Dated Movie,I loved this made for TV mini series when I saw it as a kid back in the 70's but a recent viewing shows it to be dated and long. It does have a great cast and the acting is very good. The book was wonderful the movie - not so much. I'd love to see a remake of this story but this version is just so-so.
3,Captains and the Kings,It wasn't as good watching it the 2nd time. I saw the mini series movie when it came out on TV in the 70's. It was a great move to watch. Made me thing about the Kennedy family. I
2,Kindof dinky,Cool. But the metal is very small as if it should be on a child's hand. I would prefer my mom have a more noticeable ring.
4,Nice read but has some factual errors,"I like the book for the most part but noticed some errors mostly concerning the Chicago Blackhawks. Author wrote Stan Mikita was a right wing for 20 years (He actually was a center). Author also indicated the MPH line was Stan Mikita, Jim Pappin and Bobby Hull. It actually was Pit Martin, Jim Pappin and Dennis Hull. I enjoyed the book though"
4,Another Winner for John R. Riggs,"Snow on the Roses continues the fine underrated series about Garth Ryland, publisher and editor of the Oakalla Wisconsin newspaper. As in most books in this series, there are surprises that happen with major characters which make it advisable for readers to read the books in the order of publication to really follow the developments. In this book, one of Ryland's old friends is found dead in his bed, Garth's latest romance hits a snag, and a little more of Garth's background is revealed. This series reminds me of James Lee Burke's more heralded novels although the setting is small town Wisconsin rather than bayou Louisiana. Snow on the Roses is a fine addition to the series."
2,Beenie Does Hip Hop,"For Strict dancehall fans like myself who have enjoyed Blessed and The Doctor as some of Beenie's best work, this album does not have any of his greatest hits on it exept maybe L.A.P. which dance hall fans have on the Buy Out CD already. We have seen Shabba do this and Shaggy do this before. The Grammy winning album had more reggae on it and I have listened to this one quite a bit but I am still dissapointed in the lack of hardcore authentic dancehall here. I guess it makes me enjoy Capleton and Bounty that much more"
3,Tropical storm.....more like tropical wave but still solid,"This new one from beenie man is something different and more in a hip-hop direction. Working with strickly the neptunes I didnt expect anything mroe different. Its hip-hop and reggae mixed in but hit and miss with some tracks and others. Overall I think beenie wanted to do something different but ended up with a not so strong cd as the last or the 2 before. Still fans should check this oen out as well as non-fans. Songs like: Yagga yo( a definete heavy weight on the cd..tight beat), Feel it boy(janet brings the heat while beenie keeps the beat flowing), More we want, Fresh from yard(Kim and beenie keep it flowin on this one with a good reggae/hip-hop beat), Bossman(Beeie does it right with lady saw and sean paul makign it right). Overall this new oen should keep beenie man fans satisfied for a minute. Overall a solid cd but hopefully the next one will be stronger. Still something to check out....get it."
2,More like a rainy day than a Tropical Storm,"Hate him or love him, Beenie has been arguably the most popular danceall artiste of the past decade with countless hits. This album does not demonstrate this fact. In fact, Virgin probably saw Shaggy's success as well as Bounty Killer's introduction to pop audiences via his collab with No Doubt as their way of pushing this second album more to the pop market. Well it does not work. Feel it boy has got to be one of the worst songs Beenie has ever done. It seems that everyone forgot that Sim Simma which was authentic dancehall has been his biggest intl. hit. Ms LAP would have been a better lead single but it still wouldnt save this album from the ... pile. Looks like its back to the drawing board for the Doctor."
1,What editor passed this?,"""Some Netspeak is used in this book. If you see some strange 'punctuation,' or an acronym you don't recognize, just ignore it--and buy a computer at your earliest opportunity.""To be honest, this kind of attitude from a writer does not encourage me as to their ability to explain anything. While it is (regrettably) true that ""Netspeak"" has become nearly ubiquitous, it's hardly something to use as a way of putting oneself above the reader. Ms. Hunter would have been well-served to include a short lexicon in place of this ""recommendation"" which only serves to alienate."
4,A collection of favorites,"This collection is pulled from other Antone albums. These are all great tracks, just don't expect anything here that isn't available on another album. All tracks seem to be strong and up to the level you have become to expect from an Antone release."
5,Sons of Anarchy,I bought these as a gift for my husband who really likes to see the show. I don't like him to watch it when the kids are in the room (8 & 10) so he missed quite a few shows. Now he can watch them when he wants and he won't have to miss any of his shows.
2,Disc Defect,"So far I have viewed part of season1 to the 7th episode. There is a defect on disc #2 near the beginning of episode 7 that causes a lost of the recording. Disc #1 of season 1 was OK. It is going to take some time for me to view all 3 seasons. What am I to do about the defect on disc #2 of season 1 and any other defects that may occur with the remaining discs of season 1, 2 and 3?"
4,No Christmas gift,"I bought this item hoping I would've received it by Christmas but instead almost 2 week's after! The ""shipping"" date was different online than on the actual stamp! Next time I will be a little more cautious on the way of delivery."
1,Sons of Anarchy,My DVD's do not play. They continue to freeze up and are not watchable. I will have to purchase all 3 seasons again!!
3,bad dvd's,"ordered season 1-3. season one and two played fine, we were hooked, this is an awesome show. i'm an old guy and thought i'd outgrown the biker-tough guy-hero thing, but i was wrong. then came season three, disc one started skipping and freezing in the first five minutes and continued. disc two was the same, as was disc three. Requested a replacement, which came within a WEEK; we were so happy! only to find this set of season three had the same problems. hard to describe how FRUSTRATED we were! we don't blame the merchants, but doubt if we ever purchase a product from fx network again."
5,Great price great watch thanks,I was completely thrilled with the set it was hre on time in great shape and was a great price plus a addiction for the entire three season cannot wait for the PRE-ORDERED season four to get here. Thanks very much!
5,Way To Go!,"In the past bluegrass has gotten a bad rap for being out of tune and whiney. Well here's the real world of bluegrass, fine tuned, melodic, singable and soul stirring. These songs showcase some of the top Bluegrass artists of our time, Tim O'Brien singing Colleen Malone will have you joining in before it's over. Jerry Douglas will have your toes tapping and your heart dancing with the first cut,Shoulder to Shoulder. This is a real get down the road CD. It's one of my favorites for a long drive. I highly recommend Choice Picks for those who are thinking that they'd like to check out what Bluegrass music is and for those who are alreadly into it up to their guitar necks."
3,Could be a bargain for some people.,"I just added up the current price of the seven disks in this box set...individually on Amazon....$75.79 currently. Right now, if you buy all the CDs NEW you actually save a little buying this. (Only a couple of dollars). Of course, buying them individually USED saves you a lot more but the band doesn't make any money, etc. Anyway this contains nothing you can't buy individually on Amazon but if you own NO Radiohead albums already, this will save you a small amount of money over purchasing ALL of them individually."
5,Excellent!!!,Prompt delivery. Description of item was as stated. Would do business again. Thank you.
1,Reissue but not Remaster,"I already own all of these discs, but Pablo Honey and The Bends are in need of remastering. One needs to turn the volume up for it to be a comparable sound level of newer discs like In Rainbows. Had EMI remastered these discs I would consider purchasing them. But without the remastering why bother? Some of the Pixies discs finally received remastering last year and I gladly shelled out the $30/piece as the original discs sounded terrible. I will do the same for Radiohead when the remastered versions hit the shelf."
1,I gave it 1 star only because I couldnt give it zero,"It doesn't make any sense whatsoever to buy this last chance for cash by the record company no longer affiliated with Radiohead. If you want to get into Radiohead dont bother with 'Pablo Honey' but do buy the remaining 5 CDs for around $70.00. The boxset doesnt include anything additional than the individual CDs themselves, so why pay more for nothing? If Radiohead had their way this boxset would never have been released."
1,The worst experience that I've had with an Amazon seller.,"After paying for the Radiohead box set, I was told over and over that it had been mailed. Almost a month went by and nothing happened. I asked over and over for information, and got the same answer. Finally, there was no answer at all for 6 weeks. So I requested a reimbursement from Amazon, and they took care of it right away. Thank you, Amazon! If you check their reviews, you'll see a lot of the same treatment of their customers. I just didn't check anything past the first few. That's my fault."
1,Don't Buy This,"Basically, this boxset is an attempt for the label to cash in on the very respected name of Radiohead one last time. While I personally am not a huge fan of the band, I did enjoy their most recent effort, and this whole set is just backlash due to the band not signing back to EMI and releasing their latest album digitally at a ""pay-what-you-want"" rate. EMI wants to get back at Radiohead, and this set is by no means endorsed by the band, so if you are into Radiohead, or believe in supporting the musician, please avoid this collection at all costs. It's a despicable tactic by EMI to take your hard-earned money: don't give it to them."
5,radiohead box set,"ummmm.....Radiohead didn't approve of this release. ummmmmm....so what. They should have. I love the group. I love their music.........ALL of it. They are probably the greatest band going today. Although I would choose a different one if it were categorized by best music.......ala David Sylvian.......but, as a group that has gone thru all the changes of the years and still porduced the best music on the planet..........Radiohead is it!This box set is excellent.........regardless of who or who did not approve of it.Think Ill go wander NYC with my Treo blasting some of this set right now"
1,"NOOOOOO....PLEASE, NOOOOO......","Oh, no....Babado novo?!? Please, don't associate this nulity to all the music made in Brazil...We got some good stuff like GILBERTO GIL, TIM MAIA, NAO ZUMBI, O RAPPA, CHARLIE BROWN JR. and PARALAMAS...Babado novo is that kind of sound that plays on Carnaval, with songs that sound the same and mediocre lyrics...."
4,They were Expendable,"I grew up during WW2. This book is horrifying and should be required reading by anyone who thinks war is glamourous and macho, and everyone else, for that matter."
4,World War 11 PT Boats,Enjoyed reading the book very much. The transaction was good and receipt of book was prompt. Did not know it did not have a dust jacket.
3,Cute set-arrived w/broken pieces,"I had such high hopes for this set. It comes in a great shopping basket, but maybe needed more internal packaging/protection, as the masher arrived broken, as did one of the saucepan pieces.Tried to mend the masher, but it never made it.My boys love the kettle!A decent set-as of July 2012, apart from the original broken pot/utensil, the set has held up to play inside and out, by 2 busy boys!"
5,Perfect pots and pans,I bought these pots and pans to go with a kitchen set we got my daughter for Christmas. She LOVES these and uses them daily! They are the perfect size for her small hands!
4,"Good value, lots of cooking fun","Made of heavy plastic, this set has taken a beating from my four-year-old and six-year-old and held up well. The basket is appreciated to store all the pots pans and utensils when not in use. The kids love to pretend to cook, and this set gives them all the cookware they need, at a great price."
4,My kids love it,My girls LLLLLOVE this playset! They never seem to get bored of it. My girls are 2 and 4. And there are enough pieces they don't fight over it like they do for their other toys...I'd strongly recommend getting this.
4,"fun, but flimsy","I bought this for my girls (ages 3, 1 and 1) for Christmas. I was looking for a pots/pans/utensils set that was made of plastic. They love it! They play with it almost every day. However, we've had a couple pieces break. One piece was even broken when we received it. So while the pieces aren't very durable, the kids really do enjoy playing with this set."
4,Fun pots and pans,"We bought this set for our 15 month old daughter for Christmas. She enjoys playing with them, but like most of her other toys, the novelty wears off pretty quick, so she doesn't play with it that much. I do like that it comes with a basket for storing everything. It seems very durable to me, and I like the variety of pots, pans and utensils.Update:My daughter is now 26 months and plays with these utensils often. She plays in her kitchen daily and loves to make food for us with her pots and pans. One problem I do have is that some of the pieces are a little fragile. We have some rough boys that come over for playdates sometimes and a few of the utensils have ended up in the garbage after they got broken."
4,Typical plastic toy,Bought this for my daughters play kitchen and it is worth the price I paid. It is cute and she likes to pretend she is whipping up meals and the like. Many pieces for the price of these things.
5,Great interactive toy,My granddaughter and I were busy fixing meals for the entire family. The set opened all manner of creative and educational opportunities.
4,Good set,Both our 2 year old and 4 year old grand-daughters had much fun pretending to cook using these pots and pans. Seems to be well made and liked the little basket both for their benefit of being able to carry items but also for clean-up.
5,WORLD DIDN'T GIVE IT TO ME,THE MUSIC AND HER VOICE WAS SO INTENSE I WAS DELIVERED BY LISTENING TO HER MUSIC. THE TRUTH IN HER SONGS TOUCHED MY HEART .
5,Beautiful,this is just a huge collection of all my favorite Shirley Caesar songs. I'm so happy that I found this CD. This CD just proves why Shirley Caesar is one of the top Gospel vocalists of all time.
5,The best period.,We compared this and the St. Mary's Press Catholic Youth Bible. This is simply more complete and thorough from a Catholic standpoint. The colorful and thematic pages really re-enforce positive and upbeat Catholic thinking and practice of the faith from a teen's perspective. The authors did an outstanding job of writing on a teen's level and choosing pertinent subjects to address. It is also the lowest cost Catholic Youth Bible on the market that we found. We highly recommend this Bible for Catholic youth and those who instruct them.
5,Insight into the Jeffersonian World,"Daniel Boorstin is one America's great historians and one of America's great writers - a rare combination. Boorstin provides insight into the mind of Thomas Jefferson that illuminates this crucial period of American History. He shows how Jefferson departed from the Puritan heritage and forged a new philosophical base for America that was rooted in her land, not her people. ""Things, not ideas, drove the Jeffersonian Worldview"". If you are looking for the truth underlying the birth of our nation, you will not find a better resource."
1,The book was terrible,I found that the author's philosophical ramblings were as uninformative as they were boring. I recommend this book to those suffering from insomnia.
4,4 good ones,"The selections which feature the Reverend Claude Jeter (Al Green's daddy) are ""Great Camp Meeting,"" ""Stand Up & Testify,"" ""Trouble in the Land"" (a capella) and ""Tell God"" (in church), which reflect a stylistic continuum roughly from the late '40s to the mid-'60s. None of these seem to be on any of the other CDs amazon's currently listing (6/03), and they're well worth the price of admission. ""Mother bring your daughter/Father bring your son..."""
3,Good financial primer -- but find something newer,"This book, ghostwritten by Dallas public relations executive Scott Baradell, is easy to read, but largely outdated. The first edition was written in 1993 and much has changed since then. I'd find something newer."
4,Great Product for Posture Reminder,"Great product. It fits well with plenty of extra length. It is a great reminder for correct posture. I use it while working in home health care and when sitting at the computer for long periods, etc... It does rub the armpit area, so I only use it when needed then remove it. It is def worth it...my back feels much better."
2,Not so happy,"keep it short. the brace at first seemed to work, but as I used it I found a few things wrong.1.) the brace would ride up your back as the day went2.) the straps wold loosen up over my left shoulder.3.) I had to keep adjusting it every 10 minutes, like a teenage girl trying to get comfortable in her new bra.I would reach in and adjust it constantly.I did give it about a month of use, but it is just way to cumbersome and uncomfortable.if it would stay in place and stay tightened up I would like it.it needs something to hold it down in place, especially is your a little stoop shouldered."
3,"Not great, not bad either","Akward to put on the first dozen times. Very uncomfortable under the arms, and a little different than the description but functionally the same. It does support and help the posture, but is not comfortable for me. Am now trying to wear short periods of time only."
2,"Not comfortable, not that effective","I bought 3 of these (for my sister, my mom, and for me) & it's so-so. Like someone else reviewed, the most it does is serve as a reminder to keep my back straight, but if I get lazy I can hunch over without this thing providing any support against slouching. I also found the straps uncomfortable in the armpit area. I use it combined with a lower back posture brace (which I absolutely love - the Mueller one on this site), but I could very well do without this one."
2,Not great...,"I was quite disappointed with this product. The straps were way too long and there was not enough velcro to secure the brace. I had to cut the straps and the brace itself was quite bulky underneath my clothing. I did not feel as though it helped to correct my posture, and I would not suggest purchasing it."
2,poor design for muscular male,"I bought this product because I am a mix of bodybuilder and guy works in lab forever and I hope this product can help me loose my back tension both due to the heavy muscles and long time stand. It comes out this product fits poorly. If you have a wide lat like me, you may feel the same. Stripes on both side curled under the armpit and it limits your shoulder or upper body motions significantly. You may see the vessels pops up on your biceps all the time. In a nutshell, it fits muscular man poorly"
1,misrepresented!,"The claim that this brace has hook and loop closure is false. In fact, it has neither hook nor loop but only a velcro strip closure. I consider this to be false advertising. When Footsmart was contacted they said this was the only way they could think of to describe the closure because velcro is a trademark. Come on guys, this is not rocket science. I really think the reason for this description is to fool the public into buying this item. It also feels like one has a backpack on one's back. It produces a noticable ""hump"" on the back which is what I am trying to prevent by wearing such a contraption. Needless to say, I am returning this product asap."
4,awesome,"Would work better if I remembered to use it everyday!!!But with only using it maybe 3-4 nights a week, Ive already noticed a difference in my posture, and the only negative i would say is that the straps were way too long, i had to cut them down significantly. Also I def. recommend wearing a tee shirt underneath the brace because it does hurt your armpits"
3,"Ok, not the greatest","This brace is sturdy, but I find it does not hold my shoulders back. It does remind me to do so, and perhaps that's the best one can hope for."
3,Posture Corrective Brace,"This item pulls the shoulders back as it says it will, but rubs on the front of the shoulders. Perhaps it should only be worn for a little while at a time at first. I think there should have been more information in the package on how to use the devise and why it works. There was only a small paper diagram on hope to tighten and how to cut it off."
1,Disappointing,"This product definitely did not meet my expectations. I've seen it multiple times in magazines, and finally decided to purchase it in attempt to improve my posture. Not only was it pricey (for what you get: a thick, long velcro strap), but VERY uncomfortable and awkward. It was obvious that it is underneath your clothing, as the item is thick and bulky. Did not actually help my posture, just made me more aware of it and look forward to taking it off."
1,Fell apart,Velcro quickly separated from the product making it unusable.Does not provide much support overall.
3,What you see is what you get.,"For me, it was pretty good. Does what it says it does, but at first its not comfy, but you get used to it. Only thing is dont wear it under something thin, it will show. Material wasnt that high quality."
3,Not as they said,"This product helped me straight my back, but the problem is that is make my arm and hand numb because it has the presure on my nerve. Hopefully, they can make improvement."
1,"Posture corrective brace - 22""-4^","This probably will work OK for chests under 42"". Good idea but don't believe the 22"" - ""46"" range of utility."
1,Not confortable at all,"Not a good fit. Have to pull straps too tight to have ANY results, which then cuts off blood flow to your arms."
3,Helpful for middle back pain,"I work Banquets in Las Vegas and this has helped to decrease my upper (middle) back pain. Even though it says for 22""-46"", it will fit someone with a 52"" chest, as a 48"" I had to cut a good 10 inches off of each strap so wouldn't have excess under my banquet (Tux) shirt. It won't last you years but for the price I will get another one when this wears out."
1,Not impressed,Difficult to set-up and put on. I needed help from someone to strap on. Uncomfortable and did not do the job I expected. I should have returned.
1,dont buy it,i like the material but that's about it. its uncomfortable around my ribs and it makes it hard to breathe. and its hard to move at all while wearing it. I wouldn't recommend it to absolutely anyone.
1,cuts off circulation,"This is badly designed. If the straps are loose then they slip off. If they are tight enough to stay on then they cut off circulation. Because of the non-stretch straps and where they hit, the entire front of the shoulder/arm area is affected. Awful, returning."
2,Not so practical,"Not very practical, have a hard time to make the back part stay centered and then I either feel suffocated or no help in my posture."
3,Fits.,"It fit's and all BUT.. it leaves red marks under my arms. Other than that it works, just leaves marks."
2,Poorly made,The straps were extra long (could probably fit an obese person) and were made of styrofoam - they were NOT supportive or heavy duty at all - not to mention the velcro came off.Do not buy.
3,It hurts on my armpit,"Great quality, easy to put on, improves backache, but it hurts under my armpit and if I wear it for long periods of time my hands will feel swollen at night."
3,We Returned thsi item,"My teenage son found that the product did not pull his shoulders back. His physical therapist recommended against it because in his opinion it would not make a difference in the slouching habit our son has developed. Maybe better for an adult, because if nothing else, the brace serves as a ""reminder"" to keep good posture."
5,Tour de Force,"A remarkable look at one of the Biggest Companies anywhere, anytime. How interesting to note that the British had trade relations with the Japanese in the early 1600's. I highly reccomend this book."
2,Music lover,This CD wasn't really what I expected. The music really doesn't have the same quality as her CD. Sounds kinda cheap. Also there is a woman singing in the background that doesn't even sound like Shakira. She should not even be included. I give this CD 2 stars because it makes a small effort in the music and because the words are well written. Anyone interested this is not a CD+Graphics. I wouldn't recommend anyone else purchasing this unless they settle for the mediocre.
2,"Utterly boring, needlessly complex, and dated","The author's style is needlessly complex, with elaborate sentences and odd words that could have been replaced with much simpler and clearer ones to a reader being introduced to a new field.The book's datedness is evident with references that are at least 30 years old."
3,Just OK,"This book was full of suspense that kept me reading. However, I found it to be a little dark and depressing for my taste. Even the body count was high. I bought this book because Karen Robards is one of my absolute favorite authors.Actually, the best romance book I ever read was ""Irresistible"" by Karen Robards. That book was funny, witty, and you just fell in love with the hero, Hugh. Karen's last few suspense/thrillers we ok, but I would love to see her go back to writing the regency novels - those are must reads!"
2,The Ending Should Vanish,"I have rarely been inspired to read reviews of a book after I read it, but the ending of this book is so hideously bad that I just had to come look and see if others felt the same way. I actually rather enjoyed everything up until the end, it was a bit wordy at times but I did enjoy the story. It just seems like there were so many things that didn't need to be in there that were and then you get to the end of the book and she rushes right through it. It cheapens what happened to her daughter, as though it's not a big deal to have that happen to you. I think it's sad not only in the fictional sense but also for those children or parents who have had this happen in real life. No child goes through that and just comes home and life just goes back to normal. I agree that if she was going to end the story on such a quick note like this it would have been better to have not found Lexie or to have not had Lexie survive."
3,Not my favorite,"I normally enjoy Robards' books but this one was not at all interesting to me. I questioned Jake's attraction to Sarah b/c though she used to have interests, she no longer indulges in them b/c she feels guilty for enjoying life after her daughter's kidnapping. Sarah's character was really boring and though the overall storyline could be interesting, I had to muddle through it."
2,Simply Bad,"She is obsessed with her missing daughter, adnauseam - He wants to bed her, adnauseam. Best character is the dog. Not a story for a long drive."
1,First time reader and...,"I was sorely disappointed. I spent a good hour in the bookstore trying to find a new author that I'd never read before and I even read the first few passages of this book and I thought that it would be perfect... I found myself extremely frustrated with this book. It felt like she spent pages upon pages saying the same thing over and over again... How many ways can you describe a mans body? I actually found myself skpping pages at a time because I just couldn't bare it. It felt like a rush job, perhaps a contractual obligation, but it lacked dept and feeling. There were parts that I wished would have been more developed, but weren't... It also turned me off to see many typo's... Not expected of a New York Times Bestseller. I am grappling with the idea of even trying any of her other books, but hearing that this was not typical of this author, perhaps I'll give her another try."
2,"Phrases are Repetitive, Main Character Was Dingy, Ending is Simplistic and Quick","I've liked many of this author's previous books; they have humor, fresh dialogue, action, and well-explained endings. ""Vanished"" however, drags in the scenes in between the action sequences. There are phrases that repeat many times (""This was Jake."", or ""The thing about Jake [or other people/objects] was . . . "") The ending was blunt, with many threads linking the evildoer to the rest of the plot left untied. Most annoying was Sarah Mason's repeated ventures, alone, in the dark (of course), despite already having been attacked, having her house invaded/vandalized several times, receiving creepy phone calls, a freaky message on her car window, and being warned a lot about not going around by herself -- ARGH!"
2,Disappointing,"Have been a Karen Robards fan for years. Just finished reading `Vanished,' and I'm sorry to say I was so disappointed. Was really looking forward to this book, but I just couldn't get into it. It was very boring and I had to force myself to finish, hoping with every chapter that it would get better. Vanished is very unlike any of her other books, almost as if it was written by someone else. I thoroughly enjoy her older historical romances as well as current romantic suspense novels, including Bait and Beachcomber. I've always liked her writing style with the exception of this book. Sorry the first review is so negative, but hopefully other readers will enjoy `Vanished' more than I."
1,"I DIDN""T ORDER IT","They said I ordered it by accidentally, probably I did. But I would have not 'cuz I saw all reviews that said it terrible , so once it came in. I sent it back suddenly. And got my money back"
2,Diasappointed !!,"I was TRULY diasappointed with this movie !! How can ESTABLISHED actors like Clifton Powell & Vivica Fox align themselves with such a HORRIBLE script ?? I guess it had to be for the money because it's OBVIOUS why this flick didn't make it to the BIG screen !! Oh well , I gambled & LOST so hopefully you'll take my advice & save YOUR money !!"
3,Father of Lies movie,"Didn't really enjoy this movie after viewing it. It wasn't excellent, but it wasn't good either. It was just okay. Judging by the cover, I expected to see DMX with more roles in this film besides being posted up in the church. This was the first and last time I watch that movie."
4,"It's not Triumph, but it's Rik","Not Rik's best lyrics, but some smokin' blues guitar.Listen to Head Case. Reminds me of Jeff Beck (no kids... not the talentless Beck you're thinking of)"
5,Haunting Harmonies,"I bought this album in the lp days when it came with a poster of a swamp which effectively transmitted the over-all sense of this album- peaceful, warm, rich with life, laid back and intense, all at the same time! I never did much care for the Allman Brothers, oh, they were ok and all for a city band, but this album slipped into my heart with those harmonies and the sweet picking. It seemed a good bit less forced and forcible, like being able to visit the musician in his cabin home and stay long enough to find out what the pulses of a rural life are made of.There is a relaxed communication in this album which haunted me for all of the fifteen years since I lost that album until now. I wanted it back. It didn't fade. It just played out patiently in the back of my mind, haunting me with echoes of harmonies until I broke down and came looking for it.Don't buy this album unless you are open to falling in love! This is not an album to appeal to the cynical or the road weary."
4,Outstanding!,"One of Dickey Betts best works...this solo CD is just pure Southern Country rock, with a heavy emphasis on the country part of it....If you like the Allman Brothers, Ramblin Man, etc...this is a great CD to have..thank god they finally released it!"
1,Honez,You are not listening. Richard Betts cannot play. He was guided and influenced by Duane. When that was over it was done.
5,Table Setter,"Highway Call is the album that set the table for generations of songwriters and players. Dickey took six songs and set them up with electric and acoustic instruments so the balance was a little on the country/bluegrass side. This album doesn't need a review. Dickey heard The Band and figured he knew what was up. Just listen to it and see how so many other albums found their sound. Within three years the balance swung a little back to rock, and then the whole country was into it. Every song on this album cooks. Vassar Clemmons comes into the light. The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band was listening. No one ever heard this album, but every one knows it."
1,Extremely Dull,"Jensen's biography of Schumann is a merely adequate portrayal of this most extraordinary composer. The prose is incredibly flat and repetitive--the ""insight"" that Schumann loved children--hardly original considering the ""Kinderszenen"" and ""Album fur die Jugend""--is made several times, though any further elucidation is avoided. Another glaring failure of the book is the lack of musical analysis. After spending far too much time on the youthful ""Papillons,"" Jensen practically ignores such ground-breaking works as the ""Gesange der Fruhe"" and the eerily gorgeous ""Geistervariationen."" Often, such works receive only a curious aside, such as ""dense texture"" and the like. Altogether an unsatisfying read."
5,A Great Book!,"I really enjoyed this book, which is the second that I've purchased by this author. I collect all types of autographs and am looking forward to adding some athlete signatures to my collection! I've already received several BIG NAME sports personalities after using this book - I continue to look forward to future books from this author!"
4,Lighthearted Social Satire from the creator of Retief,"Written in the mid-sixties, The Monitors pokes fun at contemporary American mores, politics and patriotism by introducing a race of powerful, but benevolent, aliens intent on improving the human race. Told from a luckless ex-pilot's point of view and featuring an embarassing cast of nuts, The Monitors is Laumer at his sardonic best. If you're a fan of Jame Retief, you'll enjoy The Monitors"
1,Confusing and Poorly Written,"Horrible ... horrible book. This thing has more plot holes than swiss cheese. I don't know what drugs the author was on, but it adheres to no common thread or train of thought and barely makes sense. One of the worst reads I've ever suffered through."
5,Colorific gel markers= love,"Really love these markers. I use them as body paint, and they go on smoothly and come off easily. They colours tend to be almost creamy, but usually look lovely.If only Amazon actually CARRIED them. :\"
5,I LOVE THESE MARKERS!!!,"EVERYTHING ABOUT THESE MARKERS IS GREAT. THE COLORS, THEIR LONGEVITY, EVERYTHING. THE COLORS ARE SHINY AND VIBRANT! THE BEST COLOR I'VE EVER SEEN IN ANY MARKER, GEL OR OTHERWISE, PAINT PEN, ANYTHING! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM AND GIVE THEM A 12 ON A SCALE OF ONE TO 10."
5,Couldn't stop reading,"I read this book in one night. Each story was better than the last one read. Since I am a plus-sized woman, I enjoyed the stories about plus-sized romance. I couldn't stop thinking about the last story by Ms. Ray, THE WRIGHT WOMAN, for 2 days after I finished reading it, so I read it again. I hope to see more stories about plus-sized women from these authors and others."
5,Amazing!!,"I loved this book. As soon as I spotted this book I knew I'd like it, just by the title alone. It was well written (especially the steamy scenes). I just kept picturing myself in all the stories. It made me smile. I'll be sure to look for more books by these authors. Awesome read!"
3,Disappointed,"I was so excited to order this & to have it arrive, assuming that it was going to be a really educational video on reflexology as it was described. To my huge disappointment it was not even close! It was very amateurish, & vague. I guess if you watched it over & over about 10 times you would grasp more. Maybe. Way over priced for what it contains."
1,Misleading in the extreme,"This title contains no gospel greats at all It is a very, very Nergo spiritual type CD, one can hardly make out the lyrics Dissapointing"
2,"Yes, Poor Darwin!","A.P. Jackson (read below) provides a well-aimed critique for Poor Darwin and its social agenda, and I will join him in offering this book a two star endorsement, rather than a single star, because I think the book provides a very interesting study for the application of evolutionary psychology, i.e., the evolution of denial (or denial of evolution?) in the preservation of the favored ideology. The contributing authors, many of whom have led respectable scientific careers, have nonetheless chosen to reject an evolutionary explanation for human mind and behavior - offering instead an emergent force, some mysterious property found in culture that ultimately boosts humanity back up on the same old metaphysical pedestal that Darwin toppled in 1859. This is evolution in progress: blind, visceral... a struggle for existence, but not, necessarily, with a favorable conclusion."
1,less than zero,"Useless. Old arguments repeated ad nauseam; biased and vitriolic; opposing viewpoints misrepresented almost to the point of slander. A parody of scientific debate, this book will be convincing only to those who know nothing about evolutionary psychology itself. Useful only as an example of how not to conduct scientific criticism. An excellent antidote to this joke is ""The Adapted Mind"", edited by Barkow, Cosmides, and Tooby."
1,This book made me become an evolutionary psychologist,"When I read this book I was a sceptic about the usefulness of evolutionary ideas in explaining human behaviour. After reading it I became convinced that whatever these people were arguing I must be the opposite. Seriously, there were parts that made me laugh out loud they were so bad. Often these embarrasing excuses for arguments had been written by people who were not otherwise idiots (e.g. Anne Fausto-Sterling, Mary Midgely) but the arguments they used here would have embarassed a first year philosopy undergrad. This conviced me that evo psy was worth looking into and that many of the objections were emotional and shallow. I now have a career in evolutionary psychology and I have this book to thank. Much obliged!"
1,jews don't like biological determinism ...,"... especially not in the hands of the goyim. Thus: EP is evil, so we must gather select Jews and shabbos goyim from various universities to write a book against it, and have still more Jews, or feminists, or Jewish feminists give it absolutely glowing reviews.No, I haven't read it, nor do I or do you need to read it. This is a work of propaganda. Simple as that."
1,Not worth the money,"This book was an absolute waste of my money. The information in the text is so fundamental as to be useless, and the so-called software on the disk is equally so."
1,bad book....,very few information for anyone especially who want to learn more.... maybe just suitable for novice....
1,Opaquely Clear as Mud,"Do you remember sitting in a College Class that the Professor was almost entertained by his own talking and bullet-head references? Well I was uninspired by Ingo's style, obviously he is more comfortable at some Lab. sitting in some white coat than he is teaching his material.DO NOT expect to come away from this Training Material with any more knowledge of remote viewing then you currently have or know.Save your money and go out to eat somewhere and imagine that you can remote view what undergarmets the waitress has on."
3,Overview information,"This 2-dvd set is a course in explaining the origins of remote viewing and also related disciplines in other fields. In this dvd set, Dr. Ingo Swann lists provides several book reviews for those interested in pursuing the skill of remote viewing."
