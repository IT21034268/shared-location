3,"Stimulating, but with liberal assumptions","Jobling provides us a good example of where liberal assumptions can take us in biblical interpretation - if the Bible is only a fallible record of human experience, there is no reason to believe it contains an accurate portrayal of God. Sure enough, Jobling believes that 1 Samuel portrays God as childish and irrational (p. 84). Despite this outrageous statement, Jobling raises some important questions that do need to be answered. For example, why does David remain king despite all his sin, whereas Saul is rejected after a trifling offence? Jobling puts it down to God's inconsistency, but there is a better explanation: the LORD made an everlasting covenant with David (2 Samuel 23:5), whereas he did not make one with Saul."
2,Way too salty!!!,I regret that as usual this food product has waaay too much salt added. I really don't understand why food manufacturers cannot allow us to add our own salt.
5,just plain tuna in a pouch,"you can't go wrong with this item. it's tuna, ready -to-eat, in a pouch requiring no refrigeration or can opener. it tastes like it should and is exceptionally affordable. just buy it if you're already reading this."
3,An Intriguing Journey,"""Trans-Siberian Express"" is an early Warren Adler novel, but it is a fine novel. It tells the story of an American doctor, Dr. Alex Cousins, and his internal conflict, while on a train with a memorable cast of characters. On the train is a beautiful KGB agent that Dr. Cousins will fall for; a former Gulag inmate looking for revenge; an ambitious KGB agent who will resort to murder to get what he wants; a Jew trying to start over; and a general awaiting orders. This story reminds us that both sides fear nuclear attack, and that the Russians were not all alike. It is an impressive journey and a fine romance."
3,Terrible index but good recording,"Printing the disc contents with pale gray lettering on a black background makes it almost impossible to read without an extremely bright light. If you buy this recording, I suggest that you copy the contents from Amazon.It is an excellent disc, but if you really want to hear a truly marvelous performance of Vaughan Williams' exquisite Mass In G Minor, get the old EMI recording - a stunning and gorgeous performance."
4,This book is a little gem!,This well done book serves to debunk and correct the stereotypical image of the American Indian. The book is loaded with reference material and guidelines for teachers. Every educator and library in America would benefit greatly from having this wonderfully educational and enjoyable book.
4,Must have book for anyone teching about Native American history,This book has been part of my personal library since I first took Dr. Mihesuah's undergraduate course in Arizona. I still reference this book and find if very relevant to educating those who want to learn about Native Americans. Very easy to read and offers suggestive reading/topics for students.
4,"Needs Editing, Short Read","This was a required book for one of my classes. Overall I thought the book was a worthwhile read. The book is short and is easily readable in two hours or so. The book is divided into many small (usually 1 or 2 pages) ""chapters"" that dispels an Indian ""myth."" However, the large majority of these ""myths"" were not new to me and I don't think would be for any well educated person, even if not familiar with Indian affairs (such as myself). For instance the myth that ""Indians were war like and treacherous"" was countered with the reality that ""Indians fought to defend their lands, sovereignty, and way of life from invaders."" There was also the myth that ""Indians have no religion"" countered with ""Indians are deeply religious."" Overall not a lot of new information and in turn nothing very controversial.Finally, the book has more than a few editing errors. Missing words and awkwardly phrased sentences require the book to be double checked by a good editor."
3,As the New York Subway rye bread commercial said . . .,You don't have to be Jewish to love this book.
2,No stamina,"I bought this pump for the pool season - having a young daughter with lots of friends, I found myself spending way too much time blowing up pool toys. This looked like a good idea. Unfortunately, it is not well constructed, and lasted only a couple of uses before the nozzle came off the shaft. It still works, but now I have to hold the nozzle in place."
3,adequate,this works but it might be worth spending more if you want something nice. buy if your not expecting much or don't plan on regular use. this maybe best for a spare or travel pump.
1,broken at first use,The nozzle of the pump broke off after 2 minutes of use. I had to throw it away.Very disappointing. A waste of money.
2,The faster blaster (almost) air pump,It is a dual action pump....Good! It is rugged....Great! It has a tapered nozzle to fit into the orifice of what you're blowing up....Not so good. The tapered nozzle works for plastic toys and inexpensive inflatables but devices with one way valves or a larger orifice...it doesn't work. It could have it there had been an adapter instead of a tapered nozzle.
3,"MX FLASH, A FAIR BOOK",I liked the concept of the book for a beginner. The author shows an example and then goes through the steps necessary to duplicate the example. What I found disturbing about the book was;1. some of the text and the illustrations don't match2. I called the number in the book about a question and the individual didn't know the answer3. my e-mails for help went unanswered.I perused about half of the book and got frustrated with it and the lack of support and set the book aside. I doubt if I would purchase another book by this author.
2,Too simple,"For somebody proficient in programming or computer science, this book is paced too slowly and spends too long covering fairly simple ideas. It's clear that this is just the right pace for some people, but if you are interested in things like actionscript programming, the book is probably not going to satisfy."
5,Excellent Buy,"This book is an excellent buy! Its not difficult and goes through a very good pace. I only spent about 3 hours currently on it and I'm already done with a quarter of the book. Other books are good references but to fully learn this software to get on the web quick, this is worth the investment in money and time!"
2,Not so much for the beginner...,I wouldn't recommend this book. It has very detailed exercises but doesn't allow the reader to intuitively figure out any of the work on his or her own. Coming from a heavy Photoshop/Illustrator background I was pretty lost and got sick of the book real quick.I'd recommend the Teach Yourself Visually series if you are a beginner instead.
2,"DECENT PRIMER, BUT..","..this is targeted at stark newbies into the world of Flash, or 'designers' getting their feet wet with animation, and for that purpose, this is a pretty good introduction.However, if you are familiar with coding in general and sport a somewhat DIY attitude then you may find this brimming with too much hand-holding for newbies. As someone really serious about his timelines, or as someone already quite comfortable with basic programming concepts, Moock's Definitive Actionscript (O'Reilly) is still the stuff to beat -- and that has some very useful observations for newbies as well."
1,Blazer Owners Beware!,This product number will not fit the newest style of Blazers. Its made for a split rear hatch (Yes it does come in 2 pieces) plus the product is at least 6 inches to long. Amazon will tell you it fits 98 and up blazers (the new body style) but they are wrong. I'm returning mine.
1,Retail Packaging???,Usually last a year. This one started to film the pages with light dusting of powder after 5 months use. Put in another cartridge- problem solved. Won't buy again from here.
1,Poor Quality,"I love this printer, and so when it was clear that it was time to replace the toner, I chose to go with toner directly from Brother. Unfortunately, this one appears to be defective after only a few hundred sheets. On every sheet I print, there is a black blob in the corner.There does not appear to be an easy way to contact the seller to obtain a refund. It makes me wish that I had gone with a different brand, but it is expensive enough that I don't want to buy another."
1,Must have been an old product!,"Must have been an old product as print was very light. Needed to buy a fresh one locally. No savings, actually cost me more."
1,Very low capacity,"This supposed high-capacity toner cartridge did not even print 2,000 pages with very little type and no art on them. Considering the cost I am VERY unhappy! I print maybe 600 - 700 invoices a month. This cartridge should have lasted a year and did not even last 3 months. At this rate it is more expensive than the ink jet printer I replaced. Buyer beware!"
1,No way does produce 5000 copies,This toner cartridge is suppose to produce 5000 copies. I am lucky if I got 2000 out of it. I am tired of companies re-filling the cartridges and selling them as new. Will not buy from this one again!
5,Very Satified Customer,I ordered the product one day and it seems like it arrived the next. Very pleased with the quick delivery. Will definately order from this company again. THANKS!
5,Same quaility expected but at a great price. Thank you,"I have purchased over 20 of this toners through my local office store, this is a great toner but very costly, when I found out that Amazon retailers sold the exact same produc, with exact same quality, but at a much better price I couldn't believe it, so all my toner purchases are going to be done through amazon. Thank you."
5,Good yield toner cartridge,"I thought these toner cartridges were awful and overpriced. our office was going through these things like Little Debbie Swiss Roll Snack Cakes. That was until I started actually researching toner cartridges. At the current price of this cartridge, the yield is $.01 a page. Compared to the Ricoh business class printers with their toner cartridge yield of $.014, this is cheaper, and the printer is much less expensive.These cartridges are also cheaper than the regularBrother TN550 (3,500 YLD) Standard Yield Toner Cartridgewhich currently have a yield of $.015 per page."
4,I LIKE IT SO FAR,"I haven't used it all to see how muchBrother TN580 High Yield Black Toner Cartridgelonger it lasts than the TN550; however, so far I'm very satisfied."
2,Print less pages than Brothers claims,"Brothers said toner could print up to 7000 pages, but it's not true. I only print standard text docs, no graphics. I don't think it can print more than 3000 pages. This is a Brother Toner, not refill or refurbish. 7000 pages is a scam. Since I've already bought the printer, need to stuck with it. [...]"
1,Not OEM !,"This is not a Brother TN-580 OEM Toner Cartridge and says so on the box. It is a Laser Toner Cartdridge that is compatible and will ""fit"" a Brother printer. I don't have a clue who the manufacturer is. After the order was placed I received a call from the company and was told it was not OEM, so I only ordered one instead of the orginal 2. For the price, I decided to take a chance. I have not used it as of yet and was told if I was not happy with it, I could return it."
1,Leaking toner cartridge,"I purchased this toner cartridge from Office Supply Tech through Amazon. Great price. The cartridge worked great for a while. Unfortunately, it then started leaking and ruining documents. No idea why I am having this problem, but I purchased another cartridge from Staples and I'm having no problems with it. It was either defective or not a brand-new cartridge as advertised. Not a happy customer."
3,It's just a toner cartridge,"Nothing much to say, the toner cartridge does what it is supposed to do, print black ink.I think the ""high yield"" version is a better deal than the non-""high yield"" version. The Amazon price is much better than what I could find in the local ""office"" brick & mortar superstores.One complaint: After you have printed the budgeted number of pages for the cartridge, the printer will ""lock up"" and not let you print any more with the cartridge. It does this even though there's probably some ink left. It's incredibly frustrating. Brother is not the only company that does this."
2,Just Another Scam,"I purchased this toner for my Brother MFC-8860DN and it is supposed to print about 7000 pages. That's a joke. I got perhaps 4500, then got the message during a large print job: OUT OF TONER and the printer just stopped. Luckily, i saw the comments here from another customer who pointed out that a little tape over the round window on the right side of the toner cartridge will let you use the rest of the toner without being scammed by Brother. I tried it and it worked perfectly!That is really the main complaint I have about this product. It works fine, but it is a scam. I will buy a generic toner cartridge available on Amazon this time and will see how that works."
4,Official Brother toners great improvement over refurbished,"I purchased refurbished 3rd party toners that were about a 3rd of the price of official Brother new toners, but our office had a lot of difficulty- toners leaked and ran all over our printers after several weeks, pages came out with huge blotches of ink on the side, and lines up and down the pages. My staff begged me not to purchase them anymore, since the pages looked terrible, unprofessional and unreadable. I've gone back to new official Brother toners for our Brother printers and have not had any more trouble. At Amazon, the prices were about 30% less than at other online office supply stores, although I wish shipping were less. It's pricier than refurbished, but worth it for the reliability of the product."
5,Quick - quiet - quality,"The header says it all. I just want to add ""simple"" and ""buy it"", I'm glad I did."
5,brother TN580 High Yield Toner Cartridge BRAND NEW IN RETAIL PACKAGE,"The cartridge is full retail product and almost half the cost of the same at leading office supplies. Shipping was fast and also free via Amazon's free shipping option. The item works perfectly and was an excellent price at $68. What else can I say, great price, full retail product! Thanks Amazon."
4,Another trick if the black tape over the holes does not work,"TN580 cartridge in Brother HL-5250DN.To get more life from my cartridge when the toner light came on, I tried the black tape over the holes method.That did not work.So I googled to find a solution that would work and found that there is a gear on the left side of the cartridge at the upper right that will lock the cartridge and turn on the toner light when it thinks the cartridge life is done.If the black tape does not work for you, try resetting the ""flag gear"" which involves removing two screws and resetting that gear.You may need to google this as the only thing I found was a pdf that showed pictures on how to do that - the url would not copy.Best of luck."
3,Lasted 6 months in medium-usage household,"The cartridge made it 6 months in a household with a law student and a grad student before the Low Toner warning came on. In the same amount of time we went through three reams of paper--1,500 pages--and I promise we were close to the 5% paper coverage Brother expects. The masking-tape-over-the-window method described elsewhere in the reviews gave us another 2 months of far lower usage. In sum: if you bought a laser printer on the expectation that it would print more pages for less money than an inkjet printer, run the numbers on the assumption that these $60 cartridges last for 2,000 pages."
5,Brother Toner,"Works as described. Previous cartridge I was able to refill once with aftermarket toner before noticing printing problems (visible with second refill, so replaced with this cartridge)."
5,Thank you Ahdaf,"I have started reading this book last week. Three sleepless nights later i put it down.What a fantastic read... This is a very egyptian novel , yet it is also a novel about sex,politics and life. I can't wait to read Ahdaf Sweif's other books."
5,i was sad to finish this book...,... and can't wait to read her works yet to come. does anyone have any suggestions for books similar to 'in the eye of the sun' in subject matter?
1,I could 't read it,"I tried and tried as it came highòy recommended but I couldn't read this book. It was too formless, too confusing, too undramatic. Be forewarned--she may have a great story but she is not a good writer. If there's a structure here I didn't see it in the first 50 pages."
3,Nowhere near as good as Map of Love,"I only bought this book because I was completely enamored with Map of Love, Soeif's second book. I am only giving it three stars because I have an obsession with all things Middle Eastern right now. I thought this story could have been told much better in about half as many pages. I was really interested in Asya's life at the beginning of the book, but Soueif tends to drag on, and too many annoying details fill up the parts between the interesting stuff. The main stories are Asya's marriage to Saif (who I think is a first-rate jerk!), her political leanings, and her affair with an Englishman (also a real jerk). The book would have grabbed me more if it had focused on these things more specifically."
4,a candid and absorbing coming-of-age story,"The most striking aspect of this novel is the candor with which Soueif treats sexual themes, a radical and refreshing departure from most novels and memoirs by contemporary Middle Eastern women writers. Asya's sexual awakening occurs on the riddling boundaries between East and West, her early life in Egypt and her adult life in England. The descriptions of her childhood and adolescent days in Egypt are heart rendingly beautiful. At over eight hundred pages, the book is a quite a tome, but utterly absorbing; I read it through in a matter of sittings! The politics she charts were only vaguely known to me, and so the book also functioned as a sort of primer on Egyptian and Palestinian history of this century. Truly groundbreaking!"
5,A survivor's guide to chronic illness,"Get A Grip is an amazing and inspirational book by a woman who has been to hell and back! As I read I laughed and cried - I celebrated her victories and was crushed by her defeats. The amazing thing is how she learned and grew from each episode. She has wisdom to share with anyone who is struggling with a chronic illness - or who loves someone with a chronic illness. She takes you step by step through the process of learning to be an advocate, first for yourself, and then for others. It truly is a must read!!"
1,didn't fit my badger 5,Did not fit my Badger 5 which I believe it was claimed to do. So beware and research to ensure you get the right product for your insinkerator. Hard to believe the manufacturer can't make this more clear.
1,Wrong Part,Vendor sent wrong part after much explanation of what I needed and much unit info given to him. Out of frustration wnet to a small local shop and with the same info got the right part first time!
5,Finally found what I needed,"For as simple as I thought it would be to get the gasket I needed, it wasn't, but you had the right one for me. Thanks for your help. I bought a gasket from a local store thinking it would fit & it didn't. You had just the right product and got it to me quickly. Thank you!"
1,Couldn't finish it,"A very disappointing book. Grayling's leftist, relativist viewpoint turned me off within a few pages. Morality and religion are not only criticized, but villified. I couldn't finish it. Not worth buying."
4,The CD Cover,"This is not a review of the CD, since I dont even have it, but while I was looking at the reviews I saw the CD cover, and is it me or are they doing a shout-out to The Kinks, because if you compare the covers its the same exact cover as The Kinks - The Kink Kontroversy. I was just wondering if anyone knows if this is deliberate or not. If so, have they ever done any Kink songs before? Well anyways I just thought that was cool."
4,A fabulous album! The band has really grown up.,"On the basis of the band's second album, ""Call the Doctor"", and a show at which they put on a truly awesome performance, I purchased ""Dig Me Out"", and I have not been disappointed. ""Dig Me Out"" is even better than its predecessor, and it is evident that Sleater-Kinney has utterly mastered the art of punk-pop. The first nine tracks of the album are all fantastic, and the others are good, too (""Turn It On"" and the title track are especially compelling). Fans of the band's early work shouldn't be disappointed by this one, for although they have certainly graduated to the next level of quality of performance, the basic sound is the same, the songs are still short and sweet, and they still rock. Highly recommended."
3,"Okay,But far from the best","I got this album after a hippy friend of mine reccomended this band.After listening to it I thought it was so horrible that I turned it off on the first track. It was because of Corin Tuckers unique""Belinda Carlisle on speed"" vocals.But it was the fast punk-pop guitar and drum stylings that I felt gave any saving grace to this CD. But in the true punk tradition,the vocals do grow on you after a while.Despite that I would have to say I liked Sleater-kinneys new album much better than this one."
2,not my cup of bile,"SK's previous album ""Call the Doctor"" was a persuasive blast of angst, with enough musical depth and genuine feeling to make it an intriguing listen, despite the harsh surface. But ""Dig Me Out"" sounds like a retread to these ears. A string of mid-tempo screechers which tests my tolerance about a third of the way through, then exceeds it when it gets to the too-obvious 'pop anthem' attempt ""Words and Guitars"". It would be fun to be young and angry enough to love this CD, but I think I'm out of the demographic."
3,*Not* the best Sleater-Kinney album,"I got this on vinyl and it sounds alright, but the songs are quite repetitious of each other. Dig Me Out and the 1st song on the other side are okay, but overall its not that good.They are a good band, however."
4,non-Victim lead singer,"Corrine Tucker and Carry Brownstone are two awesome vocalist. And in thier own different ways, very powerful lead singers. True, this album maybe hard to listen to at first... but soon you will apreciate the power of ""grrrl"" music. Built on the strenght of what the singer is trying to make you feel, instead of a 'whiney' girl who is trying to tell you what to think. These ladies have minds of there own. Viva la Sleater-Kinney!"
4,Purty Durn Good,"This record treads the rare ground of raw, gut wrenching guitar driven, hook laden, punk-pop. Reminiscent of the first Ramones record and early Buzzcocks, with a hint of The Runaways thrown in. Perfection? No. But it fills a big void. Bands like Green Day, L7 & Blink 182 tried, but Sleater-Kinney delivers, big time!"
3,Doesn't Engage the Average Teen ... Or My Son!,"I purchased the SAT Critical Reading DVD for my 17 yr old son. To have him sit through the first disc was like taking a scolded dog to the vet but way LESS fun. The idea of sitting through 6 hours with the narrator moving all over the screen was just too much for him, and in the end my teen prefered the written SAT study guide. The only break I got, was that I purchased the set used and paid a fraction of the actual cost. I think it was worth the $25 I paid for it but nowhere near the sticker price of OVER $100! Buyer beware ... check your local library first."
4,Great watch but it loses time very quickly.,I love everything about this watch except for the fact that as I tend not to use it on the weekends the watch loses time and the date gets off by 12 hours or even behind by a day or two. I think it may be due to the fact that I hang my watch up instead of lying it down as my fiance has a Seiko watch as well that sits flat when he's not using it and it never loses time!
2,This is not a book for Christians.,"I am an Anglican. I love the Anglican church, and I love our prayer book. I was hoping to find something helpful and encouraging in this book by Fr. Westerhoff.Unfortunately, the author of this book does not even believe in the accurate historical truth of the Bible! He claims that much of the stories in Scripture are merely ""myth"", rather than historical fact.But if the stories in Scripture are just fairytales, then Christianity is a faith built upon lies.The original authors of the Book of Common Prayer would be very ashamed of Westerhoff's book. Westerhoff correctly states that the community of Christians is bound together by their common histories. But sadly, he thinks many of the ""histories"" in Scripture are not historical at all.This is not a book for Christians. People who go to church, but reject the accuracy of the Bible, would probably enjoy this book. But if you truly love Jesus, and love His perfect Word, then you will not be edified by this book."
5,Narf!,"so good. These are two particularlly good episodes of piny and the brain those wondereful lab rats who try to take over the world but can never quite do it. Smart, funny, great for anyone who likes the animaniacs videos. The most surprsing part is that I can actually watch it over and over again."
2,repeat offender,"I got this model phone when purchasing a plan through verizon in May. I am now on my third and final phone of this make and already it is beginning to have problems. The first phone would overheat, and would burn my face if I was talking for over ten minutes. Then the controls and camera function began to not work properly because it would become so overheated. The second phone had electrical problems. It would vibrate at random times for no reason, and the camera image became completely distorted so I could no longer take pictures. The battery does not last very long- my current phones battery only lasts a day maximum. It's a good phone in terms of memory, though if you store too many txts or photos the phone is very slow, and it is a very nice looking phone and easy to understand. But I am dissappointed in how quickly this type of phone has broken down on me."
4,Not ALL bad,"I have had this phone for over a year and like it quite well. Yes, the battery life is not good AND it is a slow phone if you have much stored on it. BUT, the interface is easy and it beeps every few minutes when you have a missed call, and not many phones do that nowadays. That's a biggie. One problem I have that no one mentioned (and maybe it's regional), but try as I might, I can't do voice dialing bec the phone can't understand my accent. Even if I PRETEND not to have a southern accent - it can't tell what the heck I'm saying - it just keeps guessing any number of incorrect names. Other than those, I really like the phone :-)"
1,It was OK at first,"At first I could deal with the poor quality camera and the Neutered Verizon interface, but now the battery dies after only a few hours. It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem."
2,Okay phone,"This is my first phone. It's a good phone, but some things are pretty bad. Everytime I change the background on my phone, it freezes and I have to turn it off and back on again. It takes forever to load. It takes about a minute and a half for it to turn on. It also scratches VERY easily. The antenna is very easy to break and you can unscrew it very easily. But, the picture quality is very good compared to some of my friend's phones. It's a nice phone, but it's not really that great."
3,spend a little more money and get a good phone,"Yes, this is a cheap phone, but find something better.PROS:- cheap- durable- good serviceCONS:- scratches easily- menus are poor and confusing- SO SLOW- gets confused and can't load- constantly need to turn it off and back on when it is slow, crashing, stuck, or confused- is slow and easily confused the first time you use it, and it gets even slower and more easily messed up over time.Basically it runs on Java, which is slow and ugly, so avoid other Motorolas like that too."
4,Good phone,"This phone is easy to use. the antenna extends, it is also a speaker phones, so you do not have to hold the phone when you are driving. I never noticed it but sometimes, when on a call the people on the other end say you fade in and out."
1,NOT a cell phone to buy,"I did not like this product because it started having problems very soon after I purchased it. The capability of the phone to hold a charge was the largest issue. I still own this product, but have to have the phone plugged into the charger in order for the phone to keep a charge. If the phone is not plugged into the charger, it dies within two minutes and then more problems arise. When you try to turn the phone back on, after the power dies or after you just turn it off, it will freeze on the opening screen and I have to play around with unplugging and plugging it back in, turning it on and off, before this problem is fixed. I know it is not the battery itself, because after the phone dies if you take the battery out and then put it back in it has a full charge. All in all, I am very dissatisfied with the product for these reasons and I wouldn't buy this model again."
1,Horrible Phone,"I have a family plan and out of the four v325i's we got, three have failed completely. Motorola utterly refuses to recognize these phones are junk even though our local Verizon store told me that over a hundred of these phones have been turned into them as defective (and I live in a small town). Motorola has even discontinued this model, at least for Verizon customers."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"This is by far the worst cell phone I have ever owned. I have had nothing but problem after problem with it. I can not talk on it for more than 10 minutes without it completely losing its charge and dying. I have taken the phone to verizon to complain--they test the battery and say the battery is fine, and then proceed to tell me that I might need to buy a new battery anyway for $40.00??!!My advice: spend the extra money for a phone that WORKS!"
1,Don't buy this phone!,This phone has been horrible. The screens move slowly. The phone freezes up. The battery soesn't stay charged. I would definitely NOT buy this phone again or recommend it!
1,Worst phone I have owned!,I have been a motorola fan since the brick in the early 90's and have owned many other brands. THE BATTERY LIFE SUCKS!!! I have had it three months and my battery would be dead by 9am after charging all night. I bought a better 1130 mah battery that started doing the same thing after a couple of weeks. We got another V325i for another employee. Same problems. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU WANT THE BATTERY TO LAST MORE THAT A COUPLE OF HOURS!!
1,Awful phone,"I bought this phone because I'm clumsy and thought the rubbery exterior would keep it from breaking or scratching. That much is true. However...1. The menu layout makes no sense and is slow! I'm used to phone-typing very fast and this confuses the phone.2. The default settings are counterintuitive. E.g., for text messaging, it's automatically on Abc instead of iTap English. It's a pain to change it every time.3. The battery life has significantly declined in the 6 months I've owned it. One full charge only lasts about 2 days with a few conversations.4. Camera quality is very poor.I regret switching from LG to Motorola!"
1,I do not recommend!,"If you want to do anything besides make and answer calls this isn't the phone for you. I have never had such a slow phone. When going through the menus be prepared to wait on the phone, all the time. The Verizon software does not run well at all on this phone. After pressing the menu button and waiting, hit the end button and WAIT for it to return to the main screen. It is painfully slow. So if you like to text message be prepared to do it really slow. If you like to try to win radio contests forget it. My girlfriend's VX9800 can make 3 calls in the time it takes me to end a call and press the dial button twice (redial). IT IS SO SLOW!!!"
3,No on/off switch,This unit doesnot have timer at all. It works as expected however there are no on/off switch so you either leave it or take the batery out. Bad design.
5,Morbid But Supremely Fascinating,"Morbidly fascinating, this book is great, just hands-down great. Not only presents a fully realized portrait of fascinating man, but recaptures an entire era (Georgian England). What happens after the death of the subject (to his books and papers, to his museum of anatomical curiosities) reads like a short story by Borges or Kafka. Will be thinking about this one for days, maybe years."
3,Great gift idea!,"Great accessory to any garden. Smaller than expected, But overall great purchase to those looking for a decorative rain gauge."
4,Meta-analytic procedures for social research,"Quite a good book covering most important aspects of meta-analysis. I would criticize only one aspect. The one of mathematical rigor. The assumptions that should apply in order to use a technique are not always stated. That is the case with several other books on this topic.Also, I would argue against the use of z/sqrt(N) as an estimate for Pearson's r which is used throughout the book and is described as a 'good approximation', and as such propagated through the literature from here. One could easily check that the maximum of that estimate for Wilcoxon test with balanced samples converges towards 0.866... as the samples grow larger, which is far from 1. On the other hand, for some tests (like Gehan's test for censored data) it can be as large as 1.3. Hence, it is far from good approximation."
3,seek message within,"This movie delivers a strong message 'Love is part of life not heart of life'!!! Though its not applicable for everyone around,but some of us may badly need it.That's what its been seen that most of guys(boys in many cases) just waste their time seeking around love forgetting all their responsibilities.To be more precise it seems to be happening in India and film is been successful to catch this problem....Overall,if you have time and don't hate songs then go for this movie........."
5,Palmolive scrub buster the best.,This product has been one of the best dish detergents that I have found. You run water add go take care of a few other things come back and virtualy no scrubing needed.so glad I can get this product online.
4,Fast and Fantastic,"I truly love this product! It works great on all those stuck on foods, as well as grease and grime. Just let it soak a little and your good to go!"
4,Very Helpful,This booklet gives a great overview of what a Server will be doing. I found it very helpful.Definitely worth getting to have as a reference booklet
3,A Whirlwind Tour of Traditional Peoples in Indonesia,"This book describes a quick rush around much of Indonesia in search of ""traditional peoples"" by a couple who seemed to have little information about these peoples yet wanted to ""save"" them.Places visited include North Sumatra, Siberut, West Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Seram and the Baliem Valley and the Asmat regions of West Papua, but they don't seem to spend more than a few days anywhere.It is mostly interesting as a 1970es glimpse of several places which have now become major tourist destinations."
4,They are still at it...!,"The soap Opera continues in Chandler, Texas. There is so much more excitement in the second of a series than the first. There are more Medical emergencies, that are real life emergencies.The intricate details caught me off guard. The old Lady has settled her Lawsuit with the Hospital, however, Dr. Ellis isn't settling, Dr. Ellis' wife goes nuts, then the hidden evidence is found to show the Hospital and Dr. Ellis were not in the wrong. This could run the old lady out of the State of Texas. I don't know, I'll read the final book to see.Tyler Cortland is a very good writer, she gets better as she goes along. I enjoy her works, I am now a fan. Great reading and lots of excitement."
1,Don't Buy If You Only Have WM5,"This unit will not work with WM5, and there seems to be no near future support from the maker either. I can find no after market driver either."
2,2 of 4 fail in a year,"I'm not as impressed with this product as I was in the beginning.I use a Maha charger to charge my 4 Maha 9v's.Now, 2 of them won't charge, way before their expected life end. If it were 1, well, ok. But 2, this is obnoxious, incompetent, and not worth buying again."
1,Bad BRAND/MANUF. for 9V or any MiMH cells,"Bought 3 of these Maha/Powerx 9.6V batteries in 2007. I also bought the Powerx 9V charger to make sure the batts. were properly charged. One of the batt's negative (-) terminal broke off a week after purchase, so it had to be solder on. All three batts. failed within one year: the charger would fault out for bad battery. Using a Lenmar charger, I was able to trickle charge them, but they drained very quickly in actual use.Similar -- but not as bad -- experience with Powerx/Maha AAA and AA.Select another BRAND."
3,9.6V not for all applications,"I purchased two of these to use in my Shure wireless transmitter. Though both the transmitter and receiver show full battery strength, the transmitter doesn't function on the higher voltage. An 8.4V NiMH works fine."
3,High voltage and mAh on the weak side,I didn't realize that standard 9v batteries run around 540 mAh. These will not last long. A better option may be the ipower lithium rechargeable 9vs however those are very pricey. I've ordered the ipower 9Vs as I need something that lasts longer.
5,Well worth the price I paid. Lasts on average for about 12-18 months,Well worth the price I paid. Lasts on average for about 12- 18 months of continual recharges and use 5 days a week. I've replaced my original 4 of these once already and am about to order 4 more.. Doing some quick math I'd say I've saved on excess of $7-$800 per year and this will be my 3-4th year of using these continually 5 days a week.
2,Batteries Die before life expectancy,"I use the 9 volt powerex charger to charge these batteries, so there won't be any incompatibility issues.However, I have had 2 out of 3 batteries die on me after 8 charges. There is a manufacturing defect in these batteries."
1,Horrible quality,"Out of the box, the product was clearly a cheap production. The binder is made of the cheapest cardboard and vinyl you can find. As soon as I took it out of the box it was shipped in, you could clearly see that the seams around the edges were compromised. The binding area was not sealed, the edges were not sealed, and when you tried to stand the product up for it's intended usage, it is so lightweight it wants to collapse back on itself. Item was returned immediately."
4,Does the job,"Bought the easel presentation binder for interviews at an academic conference. It does the job and the plus is a no-fuss, quick setup."
1,don't need this product,You don't need this product. Simply go to the discount store and buy the smallest can of the cheapest fish or seafood flavored cat food. I bought one for 69 cents. Open the can and place the bait inside. Much cheaper and very effective.
1,Confusing and error prone,"1. Text has errors and has missing steps.2. Doesn't show how to correct errors until Unit 4.3. Confusing instructions mixed with paragraph information.4. Relies on previous material data entry to move forward. Make a data entry mistake and it is miserable. However, there is an instructor ""save my butt"" disk!5. Too much printing--you'll go through reams of paper in a small class, never my large classes.6. Thanks for listening. If publishers want to charge big $$$ for texts, the texts need to be 100% perfect and easy to use. This text doesn't fit the criteria."
2,Where's Hagerty?,"First of all I have lived in Chicago my whole life. People who say they always listened to Naked Raygun and saw them live usually mean they saw the reunited band which really isn't Naked Raygun at all. Which brings me to the point of this review. It focuses ninety-nine percent on the ""current"" Naked Raygun. Main guitarist and songwriter John Haggerty does not appear in this DVD (except for a very short old live video). I don't know whether he was asked and didn't want to participate or if they just made this without even asking him. Either way it makes calling this the 'Story of Naked Raygun' ridiculous. How can you call this the story when the guy who basically invented the Naked Raygun sound is only mentioned for maybe 30 seconds out of a 90 minute DVD. If you are a real Naked Raygun fan avoid this"
1,If I only I would've listened to reviewer before me--Don't be another victim,"Now, I'm reasonable and just as normal as you, so why didn't I listen to the guy before me? I stubbornly purchased this foul tasting product and I can't wait to finsh it off so I can say I reaped some benefit instead of otherwise throwing it away..The texture of this stuff is completely different from the Weight Gainer 2500 (which I'm used to and taste great) and it's hard to dissolve. Nobody buys trash, but Amazon sure is selling it-- don't be a victim. This stuff is so terrible, I still can't aquire a taste-- and the first day I got it, I was out looking for a replacement product."
2,Go for the chocolate...,"The chocolate flavour of this product is pretty good. The vanilla is atrocious - tastes way too sugary, like artificial vanilla cake frosting. I'm very, very, very sad that I have a 5-lb jar of it to go through."
1,Not the procduct I ordered,"I thought I had purchased the Gainers Fuel 1000 chocolate as was depicted in the product photo. Instead I received the Gainers Fuel PRO a completely different product both in taste, serving size and in contents. The PRO also contains creatine. In general, the product was unpleasant in taste, color, etc. Completely different from the Gainers Fuel 1000 which is a great product."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This movie is nothing like what you'd expect! Never once do you hear her voice, she isnt even interviewed! the interviews are horrible, the voices are strange, the footage is terrible!! and the images are off.Its an amateaur movie, and i, as a Huge Rihanna fan, actually regret buying it! :("
2,"Good Hype, Poor Book","I remember being in school in the late 1970's when this book and the story of the nearby haunted Sumerwind Mansion were all the rage. I read the book then, and again recently. It's available in local libraries by request. The writing is not the best, amateurish actually. The book allegedly recounts the story of a family who owned the Mansion in the 1970's, and their experiences related to the property. I won't go so far as to say the book is a work of fiction, but the circumstances surrounding the book have been questioned in other forums. Yes, there was a Summerwind Mansion in the woods of Northern Wisconsin. Yes, odd things happened to the people who owned the property over the years. Yes, fire destroyed the building in 1986. If you enjoy a good mystery, it makes an interesting book. If you're looking for accurate historical information, there are better sources, most noteably online for free. Save your money and do your research elsewhere."
1,Almost unreadable - was it ever reviewed before published?,"I like Mr Iron's books. His ""May it Please the Court"" was outstanding and sparked my interest in the SCOTUS. This book is no different. An outstanding subject, it is a well conceived history book with a good message. I wish I could have given it a good review.HOWEVER, my kindle version had so many misspellings as to be unreadable in many places. On almost every page (sometimes every paragraph) there were spelling and/or punctuation errors. This became so irritating I almost gave up trying to read the book. Either someone published a first draft of Mr. Iron's book without proof reading it, or my kindle version just stinks!! If it is a kindle problem, the book needs to be re-published for kindle. Unless I am the only one who downloaded a bad version of the book, Amazon needs to refund our money on this one!!"
3,I enjoyed this book but...,"This book provides an interesting history of the US supreme court and it's relationship to marginalized groups. The main complaint I have is that the Kindle version has typos on about every page. The publishers desperately need to edit the kindle version, as the typos, misspellings, random punctuation marks are all so distracting as to make a good book difficult to read. Please make corrections publishers!"
4,A good start for an overview of the history of the Court,"Mr. Irons does a commendable job interweaving the history of the framing of the Constitution in the first chapters of the book, with the application of its principles through the years. The importance of the political climates in which important decisions were handed down is well covered and informs the reader of how external influences impacted certain decisions. The evolution of application of important principles such as incorporation of the Bill of Rights through the due process clause of the 14th amendment is well presented.Mr. Irons also effectively presents personal attributes and facts not only of the justices who decided these important cases, but of the attorneys and clients who brought the cases before the Court. I recommend this book to anyone who seeks to gain a greater understanding of the cases and controversies which have shaped the application of our Constitution."
4,An Important View on the Role of the Court and the President,"One of the most important issues in the Presidential Campaign of 2000 that the media overlooked was the possible appointment of the next President of at least two Supreme Court Justices. American society as a whole overlooks the importance of the Supreme Court, and the more important issue of the President who has the potential to make the appointments. Irons does an excellent job at exposing the importance of the Supreme Court, as well as the justices who make the decisions and the politics behind their appointments. This year people went to the poles and voted for Bush or Gore. Irons helps one to realize they were really voting on abortion rights, affirmative action, and privacy rights, all of which hang on the hinges of the next two Supreme Court appointments. This is a must read for anyone concerned with American democracy."
3,An interesting look at the people behind the decisions,"This book is well written and fills in many of the story lines one misses when reading Supreme Court deciscions. Irons tells the stories very well and makes many of the participants come alive. His perspective can be frustrating at times, though, because of his unabashedly left wing interpretations. The book is good, but you sometimes wonder if Irons isn't stretching his analysis to fit his thesis."
1,A Difficult Read,I think that most of the reviewers of this book must be lawyers who are accustomed to over developed and complicated sentence structure. This is a writing technique well practiced by the legal profession and insurance policy writers.Slogging through this book is just plain tortuous. It is very detailed and is probably a good book for pre-law or first year law students. Anyone else will find it to be painful.The author is definitely a lefty but presents his viewpoints honestly and very well. The subject matter is fascinating but the execution is excruciating.
4,A mostly enjoyable read,I found this book to be very enjoyable for the most part. I particularly liked his coverage of the Marshall and Taney courts. I also like that he is very clear about his political beliefs thus allowing the reader the chance to properly frame his opinions.I do think that he started to allow his personal biases to overcome his scholarly work once he reached his own professional experience. By the end of the Warren Court it became difficult to read much of it.None the less an enjoyable book for anyone who is interested in the topic.
3,ralphie,"I liked this product, but wished that they would tell you that it is not a sprayer top like i thought it was, but instead a top where u dab it on"
5,spongebob monopoly,Great twist on an old favorite. Kids love Spongebob and Monopoly is a great family fun game and it teaches them stuff ta boot! All the little details of the game are great. Kids fight over who gets which game piece but in the end we all had fun.
2,2 bars missing,"Careless work of the editor! Besides that the sound of the recording is far too dense, there are two bars missing in the recording, namely the 7th and 8th bar after C in the third movement of Chausson's Symphony. Which is such a pity because the performance is great. The orchestra is playing very well and conducted thrillingly by Jean Fournet. But all this is messed up by a complete clueless and insolent act from the editor."
4,"Not at all a pattern language, but rather an excellent lexicon","Despite the title, this book isn't a book of game design patterns. Patterns are best practices, designed to solve particular design problems. The ""patterns"" in this book are nothing of the sort--some of them aren't even positives, but negatives.However, I still feel that this book deserves 4 stars, since what it *is* is a lexicon. And a very thorough lexicon, at that. So hey, take it for what it is, not what they claim it to be."
3,Boring to read but useful,"This book is boring for 2 reasons:1. It is highly academic, thus the text is highly extensive analytical (to a point were non academics say: get to the point man, stop overanalysing it. Lots of definitions of definitions. So heavy stuff.)2. It is a list of a lot of game patterns that are used in games. Well lists are boring to read. It is allmost as if you are reading a manual or a dictionary or so.But.....as a gamedesigner i found the patterns quite useful. It helps you to get new ideas, to screen a game idea and to judge weak spots in your design. And I mean concepts here not graphical game design. Now I have to figure out how I get this book read, it is so extensive. Bit by bit I guess.www.wouterbaars.netwww.gamesmaken.startpagina.nl"
5,high school,High School Musical 2 (Extended Edition)well pleased with this item would recomend to any one looking to keep thear doughters happy for 2hours.anthony
5,HSM2: Even better than the first!,"How often can that be said about any movie? HSM truly deserves to be a sign of my daughter's times. Great music and dancing, adequate storyline, and memorable characters."
4,High School Musical 2 (extended Edition),I purchased this item at my grandaughter's request. She loves it. I would purchase future items. I rate it 4 stars. High School Musical 2.
3,Part of a set,"Had to have it because it's part of a set and tells part of the story, but this would be the lamest of the three movies."
5,Just what I needed.,Bought this for my niece who is a High School Musical fan. Shipping time was great and it was easier to buy from Amazon that looking all over town. Cost was comparable. Also bought the first DVD.
3,Sequel Kinda Sucked...,"i'm sorry but i felt like this movie was all about Ashley Tisdale and Zac Efron. ashley's character was real annoying in this film and her corny songs didn't help the film at all. i was so tempted to turning the channel when i watched it on disney channel. to me, this movie was kinda corny and i really wish they just stopped at the first film."
3,2.5 stars out of 5,"This review is based on the TV PremierI, like many other 42 year old middle aged males, waited with baited breath for this premier....wait a minute, scratch that! Okay, so it's my guilty little pleasure, and this film appeals mostly to young preteen females, but that's besides the point. I loved the first film with a passion. I am so glad they are doing so many spin-offs on this franchise.But I gotta tell you: this film was a stinkfest. Very cliched, very cheesy, very ""obviously"" falling into scenes which then had the obligatory songs. Etc. Etc.I also watched this on television first, unlike the first one, and was quite taken aback by the number of commercials and ""extras"" they threw in. How long was this movie? 1 hour and 10 minutes, 1 hour and 20 minutes? It seemed like there was around 40 minutes of breaks, etc. Was it just me?I will not buy this on DVD, at least at full price. I'm not even sure I'll buy it at a discount.Two thumbs down!MC White said: not recommended."
3,"OK, But Not Spectacular","I watched the premiere on the Disney Channel. It was OK, but I prefer the first one. The biggest problem I had is with the music numbers. For the most part, they seemed overproduced. When I watch a musical, I don't like to hear a soloist with their own voice as a backup vocal. It felt more like a vehicle for a pop album (a big music video)than it did a musical.The only exception would be the ""I Don't Dance"" number. I loved that one, and it felt more in the style of a musical."
4,Great Movie,Great movie for my 7 year old who loves musicals. It arrived in great condition & was a terrific price! Thanks!
5,Fun special features,This DVD has fun special features on it. You get to watch them rehearse quite a few of the songs. It also allows you to use the sing a long version if you so choose.
3,"The kids love it, that is good enaugh","Personally I do not think it is as good as the first one. The story is forced, Characters do not have as much personallity and only a few songs are really good. But the bottom line is that my kids watch it 5 times a day, everyday since christmas. So it has to have something good. It is something I do not have any problem letting them watch."
4,A fun movie,"The Wildcats are back! In the sequel to the hit Disney Channel Original movie that aired in 2006, taking the world by storm, High School Musical 2 stars all of your favorites. Only this one is about their summer.The Wildcats get summer jobs at the Evan's family's country club. Sharpay Evans family's that is. And of course where there is Sharpay, there is trouble. While the number one thing on everyone else's ""To Do List"" is ""Have Fun"", the number one thing on Sharpay's is ""Take Troy from Gabriella."" And that's exactly what she tries to do. But will it work?This sequel is full of great music, just like the first movie. From ballads like Gotta Go My Own Way, to upbeat party songs like the grand finale, ""All For One.""Is this movie better than the first? I don't think so. But, is it a fun, family movie that will definitely get everyone dancing and singing along? I would say yes."
4,High School Musical 2 is Awesome,"This movie is awesome! I tend to like sequels, especially this one. I hope everyone in the world has seen it. I like the songs, especially ""Everyday"" (Dad loves that one too). The only problem is the voices are a little different in each song. I also like that they wear pretty clothes too! That's it..."
5,Great product!,I was very impressed with this order. I received the movie in a timely matter and it was in great condition.
5,great movie,"great movie, was the first hsm i watched, after watching this i just had to see the others. Love the songs they came up with for the movies.just a fun movie to watch and sing along to with family"
3,Fullscreen???,This release is announced to be fullscreen - Disney is so unbelievable backwards. It's a wonder they haven`t released it in black and white with mono sound.
1,Severe Dislike,"I have watched both, the first and second movie.In my opinion they are a disgrace to the title, ""musical.""I don't understand how anyone could watch them more than once, let alone buy them."
4,Not bad for a kid's movie,"I am full grown man. I thought I would watch this first before giving it to my niece. Not bad for a kid's movie. Now I understand why kids are going crazy for it. If you have young ones in your life, I would recommend this movie. It will keep them busy for a solid 90 minutes while you do your thing."
3,Summer vacation HSM,HSM2 features the kids on summer vacation before senior year. It's fun but not as good as HSM and HSM3.
3,High School Musical 2,Is a great movie for the 5 to early teen age range.High School Musical 2 (Extended Edition)
2,Pink camera clutch,"Camera case was very cute and the camera fit perfectly. However, the case smelled like they dug it out of a warehouse after years and years. Looked fine, but had a very strong musty odor. I kept the item because I couldn't find a replacement. Hopefully, the odor will diminish over time."
2,mildew smell,"I bought this with a camera for my granddaughters 9th birthday. It had a mildew odor to it, a musty smell. Stuffed it and wrapped it in paper set it out on the sun and the smell faded. My granddaughter loved it. It is very cute and holds the camera well."
1,A WASTE,"If you live in a place with no wind, I'd buy it. If you live in a place with wind and rain, I wouldn't waste my time. It looks great in the picture, but the structure is weak and the fabric will wear down after less than a year. Mine kept blowing away even after concrete posts were put next to the frames."
2,"Nice item, but IT WAS USED BEFORE!!!","Looked like a good deal, and it was delivered 2 days after I ordered it. BUT IT WAS USED BEFORE! At least PARTS had been used before. The canopy material is new, as are the bungee cords. The metal tubing sections WERE USED! The paint was severely scraped from having been joined and unjoined before, and a couple leg sections WERE PLUGGED WITH DIRT from having been set up on the ground previously. Everything was neatly packed, and once I unpacked it all and realized I'd been had, I decided it's way too much hassle to re-pack and return the 80 lb. package. They got me!"
2,You get what you pay for,"Brought this to replace an old Kmart 10x20 canopy that I've had in place for 6 years. The tarp on that finally worn out and ripped in the last wind storm. Could not find a replacement tarp that was cheaper than buying a whole new canopy.The package came torn but contents were ok (it's pretty heavy). Tarp is ok, not as thick as my old Kmart one. So I expect this one to last only 3-4 years. The metal frame was really disappointing. The steel tubes are only 1-1/8"" diameter while my old Kmart frame was 2"" diameter. Some of them started to rust (inside) after sitting in my yard for 2 weeks. We get pretty good winds here so I wasn't sure if these flimsy legs would stand up to them. My solution was to toss the new frame and reuse my old Kmart frame. It works."
4,still standing,I had this car port for a few months now and it has worked great...you must tie it down really well
3,"Album is ""OK"" Jarvis Enthusiasts","After reading the only existing Amazon album analysis, the review from hell I call it : ), and being a Jarvis fan of ""sound mind & body"", I purchased a CD copy and found it to be quite listenable, noting three considerations. Jarvis is primarily equated with orchestral jazz (this is small group music). The album is his ""pioneer effort"" as a group leader. Lastly, noteworthy as far as any negatives are concerned are the technical aspects of the actual recording sessions which could have been better, i.e. the studio work."
1,When It Rains,"This is the worst CD that I have ever purchased. I can understand why Amazon did not have a media set up to play it for no one would have purchased it. Since it was Jeff Jarvis I thought it was worth the risk, but it didn't come close to the talents of the man and the rink a dinks he had playing with him were terrible. The jazz band at the local high school can play rings around them with out even working up a sweet."
4,A Life's Journey,"Whether you're a guitarist, Taylor fan, jazz musician or just like to read good biographies, this book will keep you captivated. Taylor and Mead give you a depiction of what a life can become when you follow your heart and let life, with all it's foibles, be your teacher.Not only is Taylor an extremely gifted musician but I would say he's a bit of a gypsy, as well. The list of people he has played with is literally a ""WHo's WHo?"" of All-Time Jazz Greats, some well know and some obscure.The book is not only an easy read but it's also filled with interesting tidbits and funny anecdotes."
1,really poor quality,"Length:: 0:34 MinsThis toy is threadbare straight out of the package - very poor quality, very poor construction. They toy on the left in the video is mine from a different manufacturer and has been played with heavily for over a week, showing little sign of wear and tear. The one on the right is the Vo-Toys brand pom pom which arrived this afternoon and has NOT been played with. Normally I would not bother sending something with such a small price tag back but I'd like this manufacturer to get the message that this is really a piece of junk."
2,Doesn't hold up,"At first glance the glitter pom poms look fine. but the little glitter pieces fall out during play. I have glitter pieces all over the house. We now take the glitter out first, and the pom pom is the favorite toy."
1,don't waste your money,the product is poorly constructed and falls apart easily. the glitter can be eaten by your cat. we were trying to replace a similar toy that was given to us by a friend several years ago. it looks similar but holds up much better. i don't know if this is an updated version or a bad imitation. beware
2,Cat toys,Unfortunately my Lulu does not play with this toy too much. I don't know if it's the glitter that turns her off but she does not pick up the toy and bring it to me as she does with the pom poms. The amount of toys and price was ok.
3,Turned my cat's paws red,My cat goes absolutely nuts for these - I can only presume it's the glittery bits that get her attention.Drawback: They turned her little white paws a dull cranberry color! You may want to throw these in the wash or give them a good rinse before you give these to your kitty.
3,Fair,"This is a pretty good book. It has 3 main sections: one on special forces from different countries, one on special forces operations, and one on equipment."
5,So happy I ordered this book!,"I bought this book for my galfriends, myself, and my daughter. We are all impressed and learning from it. Mark Nepo's writing style is calming and magical. Some of the dailies are more profound than others. They are all thought-provoking and have prompted discussions. I just love the book and have learned so much in just the 29 days I've been reading it. Look forward to it everyday and ALWAYS feel a sense of peace after the meditation. I rarely write reviews, but I think this book is truly valuable (in my humble opinion) and want others to know this. Thank you, Mr. Nepo!"
2,I really wanted to like this book....,I bought it after Oprah recommended it. I read it for 4 months and finally had to let it go. I gave it 2 stars because about 40% of it was useful. The rest of it mostly just did not make any sense. The passage for the day would start out with one idea and by the end conclude with something else with no connection. I am now reading Tom Walsh's Living Life Fully's Daily Meditations Year One and it is much better in my opinion. Similar organization but much more practical and useful.
3,Buddhism,"A little off subject compared to other reviews, but this author isn't all that clear on Buddhism and simply invokes it by name only. Flowery language about reincarnation aside, this lacks a deeper understanding and probably isn't the best jumping-off point for those looking for anything but the most superficial and trite perspective on what is a very deep system of beliefs."
5,"Voted a ""favorite thing"" by a certain woman for a reason.","If you're into this type of thing - this book will talk to your soul. If you're not into this type of thing, but are open to it - this book will help you remember that there is a bigger picture and the bigger picture is more peaceful than the little picture. If you hate this sort of thing - you may almost like this book."
5,"The Book of Awakening, By Mark Nepo","For those who look for a deeper meaning to life, and seek unusual paths to navigate it, this book gives a day-by-day meditation to help us understand the twists and turns our lives take with real examples taken from the life of a man who traveled to the brink of death, in his battle against cancer, examples that shed light and inspiration on our own complicated journey toward enlightenment. Quotations at the beginning of each day's meditation are well-chosen and particularly helpful."
5,I bought it for my grown children!,"Rarely does a book inspire me like this one!Mark Nepo is brilliant and has provided a thought provoking way to begin each day.I highly recommend it, and in fact, purchased two more copies for my children, 24 & 33."
3,A lovely book........,"I'm sure it is fine for some, but he is a bit ""to present"" for me. I have some difficulty with his concepts at times, and I'm a pretty progressive thinker. It is a beautiful book, but one must truly be enlightened for this one."
2,Too much in the past.,"While there are many insightful passages, I find the author stuck in the past. He's always bringing up his cancer & bad relationship with his mother. My heart goes out to him, but I find the book depressing in some ways. I'm sure it would be helpful to others, just not me."
5,The Book of Awakening,"This is a little daily reader, and it is really a lovely one. Mark Nepo borrows from many religions and philosophies of the world to give us a morsel to think about each day, and provides guidance for a daily meditation practice based on the reading."
5,Excellent Book - Probably not for the Oprah crowd though,"It is amusing to me that the bad reviews are from Oprah fans who just ""didn't get it"". Yes, I don't get Oprah either so to each his own. If I had known before buying it that it was an Oprah Book Club alumni I probably would have passed but, lucky for me I came across it in the fire sale at Borders and I am just thrilled with it. It is deep and philosophical and beautifully written. I am truly inspired by it. There have been a few passages that, at first seemed to miss their mark but then when read on a different day in a different mind set and situation completely make sense. I found it amazingly enlightening and will read it over and over."
5,LOVE THIS BOOK,"Looking for spiritual awakening, you can get a daily does of insight and poetry from Mark. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK"
5,Required daily reading,Yiur day & your life will get better if you read & review each story for the day. Real wisdom without being preachy or anything wacky. Wonderful book!!!
4,Great book,"Was a Christmas present, was pleasantly surprised. Book is a daily reflection and the new year is a great time to start"
5,Finding your center,"Nepo's book was given to me during my radiation treatment 5 years ago and I have read it daily since. It was a source of inspiration for me during a trying time and today it is a touchstone for my daily practices. He has been to the edge of the abyss and he returned to share his story with the reader and to act as a guide for all of us. So, whether you are facing an almost insurmountablepersonal challenge, climbing a mountain or looking for a guide to lift your spirits and show you where to walk along the path in your daily journey, this is a book you should consider. It makes a great gift for anyone who is living life."
5,A Great Reminder to Live in the Moment,"This is the second time that I am reading this precious book. The first time, I was new to New Thought and this book was rich with teachings on how to live each moment even through and especially through challenging times. Now, reading it for the second time, I get to see how far I have come in the last 12 years in learning to be just who I am and this book now serves as a reminder as well as a way for me to go deeper into my experience of life. A truly thoughtful and joyful daily read."
3,A little too religious,"Although I'm always enjoying these types of insightful memoirs and books, this one incorporates quite a bit of 'god' mentality."
1,Weird crazy?,This book was on Oprah's list one year so I bought one for me and my mother. This was a very weird crazy book. Most of the things I read did not make sense to me. Maybe I am not a theological person. I am not sure why this book was so hyped!
1,Not for me,"After readiing a few chapters, realized that my views are vastly different from the authors, therefore didn't finish the book"
4,The Book of Awakening,very well written book. am enjoy reading it right now.i find it a very good self help book with many helpful suggestions throughout.
3,The Book of Awakening: Having the Life You Want,"I think the book is well intended, but I cannot say I fully understood it's meaning. It has daily passages for personnal transformation.Frankly, it's not something I fully could appreciate."
5,Uplifting,"Not surprisingly, I saw this book on an ""Oprah's FavoriteThings"" episode. (it was one of the only things in my price range, actually) I bought it for myself, and have since given it as a gift twice. A page a day of terrific insight into who we all are."
5,Amazing,"If I could only keep one book, it would be The Book of Awakening. I am in my third yearof cycling the readings - I continue to be inspired, and to see them with new eyes, I appreciate theblend of poetic and spiritual. So far, I have given at least 25 of the books as gifts.Mark's wisdom and insight need to be shared."
2,pamphlet,"The book that came with the kit was in reality a brochure. I realized that there is only so much information about ethernet cabling, but the 4x6 booklet was almost useless. Also half of the 60 page book was in Spanish.Etherent cabling is color coded, the booklet is printed in black and white. While its small enough to put in a shirt pocket you need two hands to hold it open. Unless you are going to memorize the color combinations, your first try will be a little difficult.The tools seem solid enough. The amount of cable, cat5e, is adequate. I have come to expect more from the ""dummies"" publishers."
3,Type of material,I would like to have known what type of material the ankle sleeve was made of; wheather it was heavy or light. I wanted to sleep wearing it but I can only wear it during the day. It seems to cut off my circulation at night. But it does keep a lot of stress and strain off of my ankle while I am walking. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR THIS PURPOSE IF A PERSON HAD ONCED BROKEN THEIR ANKLE WHICH HAPPENED TO ME 43 YEARS AGO.
1,it and replacement stick 6 minutes into dvd,it and the replacement stick 6 minutes into video. flawed product. tried it both copies and several players and the second copy wouldn't even play on a blue ray either.
1,"Outstanding, and influencial person.","I've felt that this is was the best album from those Level 42 years. Most of the members are involved in some capacity. It features several strong grooving tracks like ""Pictures"" and ""Essentials"" and MF'ing ""There is a Dog"". I was fortunate to meet Mark and the guy's during the World Machine days. They were equally excited and supportive of thier Trace Elliot playing leader.PS: check out Meshell N'degeocello and Chalklet."
1,No tech support,"I bought an GM270 and the Iguidance software based on the first review posted here, and the dang thing is only good for skipping on the water.Holux is a sham, they do NOT provide ANY support for the piece of junk they sell.Once inserted in the dell x51v adn installed their GPSviewer software, (which is their testing/demo program) all I get is that GPSviewer.exe fails to open half the com ports, and the device is NOT on any of the ones it CAN open. (and how the heck are we supposed to know what baud rate we shpould use, is it still 1978??)GM-270 and anything-Holux in general should be considered an utter waster of time and money."
5,Very nice product,This does a very good job of cleaning my computer screen and protecting it when closed between the keyboard & screen. A bit expensive but a good product non the less.
4,Let's hear it for diatribe in this case,"I was delighted to find this obscure work of polemics on capital punishment throughout history and up to the (author's) present. Undertakes a diatribe on captial killing without the reactionary alarm on one hand and the sanctimonious philosphical, social, historical, and otherwise casuistic justifications of Foucault on the other. Actually quite useful when taken as an antidote for Foucault's overwrought ""Discipline and Punish."" Postmodernists who want to casuistically revel in the delights of capital punishment can go back to their Heavy Metal magazine and their coffee table Witkin.Not exactly art in any sense, this is nevertheless one case where diatribe serves as a welcome comic relief against what is a grotesque side of civilization. There is nothing so sacred about capital killing that we can't poke a little fun at its excesses and abuses too. And for the yo yo reviewer below, let us know when you actually read the book and get near a review."
1,Mad as a hatter,"Charles Duff was obviously an inteligent man, so why would he write such dribble. I felt the book could have been summed up in the first few pages, thank God there are few left in the world with beliefs like him."
2,Good in some ways,"Like the description says, it's a book of everday used slang by russians.Pros-It has a LOT of stuff-Written like a phrase dictionaryCons-Too large to take with you everywhere-Would take to long to search if having a conversation with someone-A lot of stuff most Russians have never even heard ofMy girlfriend is 24 years old, and Russian. I wrote a lot of the phrases in here, with the explaination. Her and her friends said that most of them are never used, or they never heard. My opinon this book could of probably been cut in half on size, and probably cost too."
4,Informative,"Informative is what any dictionary should be, first and foremost. This one is. I am glad I bought it, though I miss some expressions I think should have been entered. But one can`t have everything, can one? And it is not an easy work, making dictionaries!My sincere thanks to the authors and the publisher. I`d say the dictionary is more than just a reference book; one can just read it for the pleasure of reading."
3,good but could be better,"There are great written accounts in this book, but more pictures would benefit anyone using this book from a beginning biologist to a seasoned professional. It may be better if the book was seperated into about 4 parts. Peterson guides are a good bet for anyone beginning, but I would suggest seeking this out in your local bookstore before buying on here because you may be able to get a lower price on Amazon, but you may not get the book you necessarily thought you were ordering with respect to the books content and ability to convey information in the manner needed."
4,Encouraging Words for Those Who are in the Trenches!,"The contributors are people who are widely recognized in ministry. Some are professors, others are pastors, and others still are consultants. The goal of this volume was to challenge leaders to become better at the art of leading. The authors are evangelicals representing a wide variety of views within evangelicalism. Barna is certainly known for his previous works on church growth and trends in America.The uniqueness of this book is probably the honesty with which the contributors make their points. It felt more like a personal interview with many of them. They did a good job at getting to the heart of the matter. So often leadership books are trite or boring. Many authors of such books seem to know-it-all. I seldom felt that way while reading this book. The contributors seemed to have a genuine interest in helping the reader to become all that God wants him/her to be.Paul Heier, author of Leading Out of Love"
4,"Pricey, but convenient.","I know it's a bit expensive for email and 10G of online storage, but the way it integrates with Mac OSX, iCal, Address Book, etc. is amazing. The online mail reader is the best out there as well. Love it!"
5,Now called Me.com,I avoided buying this for a long time bucasue I thought $[...]. was too expensive. But you can actually get it most any time from Amazon for about $[...]. so I finally bought it. I really like it now. The integration with the Apple software that come on the new Macintoshes is extremely good. I will continue to buy it every year from now on.
1,lemon,"First off, Apple converts this to mobile.me (me.com rather than mac.com) when you go to activate it. Unfortunately they've yet to get mobile.me stable, in fact I've had to disable all the ""enhancements"" to get my iMac stable again. If you really want mobile.me this is a good price for it, but I can't envision why you would want this lemon."
2,I'm not sure why I keep doing this...,"I don't really think .Mac is worth as much as it costs, but I've had this email address since it was free and I don't want to change it. I guess the increased amount of online storage will be useful for critical off site backups. At least I can renew for cheaper thanks to Amazon."
3,dot mac,"New improved dot Mac accounts. More storage, more tools. But back-up is still painfully sloooooow."
2,not 6.25 inside!,"This product advertises that it is extra long with 9"" total length and 6.25 inches in the spout. We need something extra long because of the length of pipe extruding from our wall and it has been impossible to find! This product, if anything, was shorter than most because of the internal side diverter. I wish there would be a clear way to describe these products so that we could find something that works for our circumstances."
5,Excellent Complement to Other Learning Materials,"This is an excellent complement to my other Arabic language learning materials. The fact that it uses transliterated Arabic is not an issue for me; what is more important is that it explains grammar clearly and provides information and explanations in very easy to understand language. I have already learned the Arabic alphabet and their equivalent letters in the alphabet we use for English, so it does not matter that the Arabic in this book is transliterated. In fact, in some respects it is an advantage as I can read through the material more quickly to better focus on the grammar points I am trying to learn and understand. I test myself by transliterating the transliterated Arabic back into Arabic script so the book serves two functions."
1,Too Confusing!,"I usually think the ""Dummies"" series is incredibly helpful.... but I have not used one for a foreign language before so perhaps the series is simply not suitable for learning a language.My main problem was that the CD did not follow the way the transliteration was spelled! Reading the other reviews, it seems that perhaps this has to do with the difference between MSA and how real people speak - which while understandable, does make learning rather impossible for a beginner!The speakers were also way too fast - the first reviewer says there were two settings on the CD - where?!!Lastly, I think the text jumps around too much - it's as though the author is not clear whether the book is for tourists or for beginning serious students."
5,great book,I received my book is the best amount of time. I enjoyed this book very very much. I plan on buying many more books from them. Thank you so much.
4,An Honest Opinion...,"So far, so good... Though, you will have to do more than just read the book and the exercises inside it, you will have to practice and practice..."
2,Don't like the transliteration system,"I am in complete agreement with Al-Shayib's August 5, 2006 review. I too took a good look at the book at the book store and was unhappy that the book uses a transliteration system without at least showing the spelling in Arabic. I could have made allowances if it weren't for the fact that the transliterations used do not correctly approximate the correct pronunciation such as 'kah-leb' for dog when it should be, as Al-Shayib said, kalb or kelb. Needless to say, I put the book back on the shelf."
1,It's truly for complete dummies,"The book is friendly, but it has no arabic script at all! I was very surprised at how a language can be taught without first studying the alphabet and then some words, and the trying to write it all down... but this book just doesn't cover the script (which is so beautiful %)). It just tells you how to pronounce words and what they mean, but you will never learn how to read and write in Arabic with this book. I decided it's a worthless way of learning."
5,Gorgeous,I got a bonus at work and wanted to get myself something special. This watch is all I could have hoped for and more. It is so pretty and unique and the Swarovski crystals really set off the face. I couldn't be more pleased.
5,Beautiful Watch,I usually wear it on functions. Very beautiful gold watch. A nice formal wear i simply love it. And would recommend to others if thy want to buy a nice beautiful gold watch. Very light weight.
5,Was Skeptical About This At First...,"...but it's a beautiful work of art. I don't know much about dance or ballet but by the last couple of songs, I was moved to tears--joyful tears, actually. The dancers' performances brought something new to the songs and the messages they contain as a collection. I think people who are visually-oriented will enjoy it in a different way than a longtime Joni fan. Either way, it's simple, stunning, and moving."
2,"Unfortunately, quite boring.","The choreography is very dull, anxiety is obvious in some dancers, and the overall result is not good at all. The only good thing that I found in this DVD is Joni's music. Her music is simply too beautiful."
1,Dont buy this one!,"This movie was recently released by Image entertainment under the title ""Heaven and Hell."" Dont buy this one!"
5,No Complaints Here!,"This tool set is of great value! It is well made, versitile and gives you everything you should need to get started with terminating a variety of different co-ax cable and mating connectors. I would highly recommend this product!"
3,It's Okay...,"The picture looks pretty nice but it didn't fit well on my feet. The front is too wide and the size is slightly big on me. I usually wear 6.5 but can sometimes fit a 7. I ordered size 7 and maybe that's why it's a bit loose. Heels are actually 4.5"". Not happy with the style but the quality is good. If you are a true size 7 and have wide feet, then this may fit well on you."
1,DONT' PURCHASE THIS FRAUDULENT PRODUCT,"This is a terrible dissappontment.Ingredients are: Vibrational Infustion of Boab, Dog Rose, Five corners, Southern Cross, Sturt, Desert Rose, 66.6 % Purified Water (NOT ON THE DESCRIPTION) AND TO BEAT ALL................*******33.3% BRANDY. (12.5% aLCOHOL)ARE YOU SERIOUS.. !!!!!! Will never purchase from this company.Sad Sad Sad"
2,"Roy is great, but understand what you're getting!","Roy's easy demeanor and great talent are enjoyable to watch. But these DVD's are not for a beginner. He slows things down a bit, but he does not slow them to the point where you can see each pluck. And the arrangements are thick/intense enough and require enough quick and subtle muting/technique that a beginner (or even a low intermediate like myself) might be overwhelmed. Oh well."
5,About this CD,"Robert Pearsall and Charles Wood - Madrigals and PartsongsPriory #PRCD 622The National Youth Choir of Great Britain/ Michael BrewerWorks on this CD:Charles Wood:Music, when soft voices die.How dear to me.The widow vird.The nymph's fawn.Come, sleep.A clear midnight.When winds that move not.How sweet the tuneful bells.When thou art nigh.As the moon's soft splendour.Song for a dance.If love be dead.Nights of music.The whispering waves.Full fathom five.Hence away, begone!Robert Pearsall:Lay a garland. great God of love.Light of my soul.Summer is y-coming in."
3,something for relax,it's a story without violence tha start very slow but at the end you wanna keep reading it's diferent.ok it's not the master pice but in these days you can`t ask for more hahaha for me it's ok.
3,Could have been better,"While the content of the book is good, if they had held off on it's release and combined it with ""Until the Stars Grow Cold"", it would have been a much better book. As it stands, it's a fairly good read, with JMS's controversial 9/11 issue, and his heralded ""Conversation"" story. However, it still feels incomplete."
5,Purchased for my daughter,My daughter loves these shoes. They are very cute and she says they are comfortable.
4,LOVE DAT FREE KITTEN!,"I especially like Free Kitten cuz I've (reluctantly) got so SICK of Sonic Youth taking themselves so gosh-darn SERIOUS. I can't help but compare them to SY since FK features SY-er Kim Gordon. Kim and her (also from other bands) co-horts in Free Kitten make slap-dash music that isn't very original, and is NOT polished, but, it's fun, and to me, in some ways, is almost a girl version of the Beastie Boys, when it comes to musical 'tude. SENTIMENTAL EDUCATION adds variety to the FK mix with its extended jams/instrumentals, which give the punky girls-in-a-garage numbers even more impact and punch! Their cover of ""Teeny Weenie Boppy"" is so sassy and fun. Recommended if rough edges have more staying power for you than polished studio slick-osities.."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!!!,"Don't waste your hard earned money on this piece of rag. As usual the music company has chosen to take one of maddy's biggest hits, Deep in the darkest nights, and put it on a collections CD, but why a live version?? Why not at least the studio version and as a bonus , the live version.And the music industry and the record labels all wonder why PEER2PEER services such as limewire, Bearshare, and WINMX, continue to thrive. Greed fuels the whole industry."
4,Courageous,Why is this book out-of-print? It is well-written and the subject matter is timely. Furthermore why was this case so hushed up that I had never even heard of these crimes? The incredible evil of the perpetrators and of the radical pedagogues who inspired them is in the same league as the Manson family murders and yet there has been virtually no coverage of these heinous crimes. It was very brave of Mr. Howard to write this book and brave of the publishers to publish it. Also recommended: Paved with Good Intentions by Jared Taylor.
5,Well told true story,Clark Howard tells the story of the California Zebra murders like no one else can. It is twice as frightening when you realize it is all true. The first chapter alone will shock you. I'm surprised this book is no longer in print.
4,why is this case considered closed?? it should still be open,"considering just how limited/censored the info on this case is, Zebra is an OK read, I wish it was more from the police perspective as the killer perspective has to have some serious conjecture. Why this case was never fully solved is astounding , they convict a few people for a 14 murders, when there were perhaps dozens of killers and 70+ confirmed murders, the pattern was Black Muslims, so how hard could it have been to pursue that avenue."
3,"Nicely Done, but","I had seen this production on PBS years ago. Its a nicely staged production, but I had forgotten how annoying it was when the camera would move from the action on stage to pan the faces of children in the audience. Its like someone throwing a bucket of water on you while you're in the middle of a nice dream."
3,Humperdinck's Hansel und Gretel,"Reading subtitles to ""little ones"" was undesirable. Musically very beautiful."
3,Good USB hub,"This is an good way to get additional USB ports for not very much money. It is fairly convenient to use and easily supports backing up files on small USB drives, downloading photos from small media readers, or uploading files placed on USB drives on other computers. This hub performs as advertised and was delivered in a timely manner."
2,does not work always,this USB hub keeps disconnecting devices and I had to wait to reconnect. I ordered belkin usb hub and it seems working better.
1,Died in a week,This mini-usb stopped functioning a week after purchase. It's still capable of charging and powering my devices but no longer works with data transfers. Product feels shoddy and the time at which it took to stop working proves that. I would not recommend wasting money on this product.
1,Stay away,"I bought this item without knowing anything about Targus. I bought a number of USB hubs before this one and found this one convenient and portable. Suffice to say that I was badly inspired as this hub was fried after less than 6 months of use. No way to find out what happened. LED dead, does not recognize anything. I am a reasonable user, so it must be either a defective model or simply a cheaply manufactured item. I would lean towards the second case. Avoid if you can."
5,Nice Little Hub for a Laptop - Works Great on my Dell D600,"Unlike a previous reviewer, my targus mini-hub was picked up right away under XP running on a Dell Latitude D600 laptop. I shows up in my Hardware Devices as a USB 2.0 hub. Everything I've hooked up to it so far works just fine (webcam, mouse, etc). Very handy size, and I like the LED indicator light that lets you know when its connected."
1,disconnected.....,"love the size and simplicity of the product but unfortunately at the end of the day, it didn't do the job. had a 8gb flash drive stick and 2 iphone chargers connected to it, it kept 'disconnecting' them. figured for the price it's worth a try but now, must find something else that actually allows me to use it.... bummed..."
4,LOVE IT VERY USEFULL,IF YOU NEED MORE PORTS because you filled them all up this is the perfect thing to buy for your computer...no power suply but who really needs one
4,Gets the job done,A simple hub that gets the job done. Works on Macs just fine. I would have liked the chord to have been longer than an inch and a half though.
2,Not good for external USB-powered drives.,"For my purposes, this hub fails a bit. I have a lot of external 2.5 USB-powered drives (i.e. there is no other power source) that I use with my laptop, and this hub does not provide enough juice to power them. In fact, myWestern Digital My Passport Elite 250GB USB 2.0 Portable Hard Drive (Titanium)drive does not show up when used through this hub. The light comes on, but simply blinks.This hub might be good enough if you have a bunch of simple solid-state USB sticks, a USB mouse or dongle for a wireless mouse, etc. That said, it might be worth looking at a hub that will do it all, and steer clear of this one unless you feel compelled to buy it. I got mine at a well-known big-box retailer for half the MSRP, so I don't feel too bad about the purchase, but if I can find the receipt, I may take it back."
2,Targus USB Hub,"Well, It worked Great for 2-3 months... Just Got Hott!! NOw it don't work!!I don't recomend it. JUnk Junk Junk Junk junk"
1,"Cheap garbage, almost never works","This is the worst USB hub I ever owned. Tried to use it on my PS3 but it was horrible and wouldn't recognize half of my devices or it would but when you restarted the PS3, it wouldn't anymore. I thought maybe it would be better on the PC but it's equally garbage. Doesn't recognize Sandisk USB drives, only seems to recognize certain devices and then only when it feels like it. Instead of giving you extra USB slots, this garbage wastes a slot you could have used for something else. Bought this at Walmart because I was in a hurry, never again."
4,Nice little high speed USB hub,"This hub is great because you get USB 2.0 speed for all the attached devices. The cord on it is REALLY short, however, so I don't really recommend it for desktop computers. It's really for laptops."
2,Cute gadget but poor mechanical design!,"Nice appearance and does the job, BUT plugging USB connectors into it requires a lot of wiggling and even a bit of forcing; so far my USB flash drive will only connect to 3 out of the 4 ports."
5,This item works like a charm,"I have three items that require USB connection. I use to have to keep switching plugs in that tangle of wires.Now I can connect all my USB's in one place and do the connecting from my keyboard. Great little hub,glad I bought it."
1,Port does not work on some machines,This multi hub port works on my mainframe but not on my laptop.Poor design
4,Seeing Faery,"We've had so many of our kindred recommend this book and author...dear lovers of Faerie Lore,... we had to check it out. While our own relationship with Faerie is somewhat different from the author's, we can certainly see that there is much to be learned and a great deal to be gained from those who feel inclined to the path of Faery Seership as Orion Foxwood outlines in this book. Ultimately we can but say, trust you own heart in choosing this book to read or not. Intellectual considerations would, we think in this case, lead you astray. Trust your feelings. If in looking at the cover of this book, you hear Faerie calling, then this truly is the right book for you at this time.kyela,the silver elves"
2,The Price is Too Good to be True,"Even though the price is amazingly low, the quality of the product stinks. The ink ran out after about 20 sheets of paper, leaving me to go out and buy a replacement for the full price of about 50 [..]"
2,Low Quality Ink,This cartridge is a great value and great for general printing needs. However not suitable for printing with any degree of quality as the ink bleeds much more than OEM ink cartridges. Noticeable bleeding on all grades of paper and photo paper.
1,Pseudo-intellectual rubbish.,Poor organization and the absence of historical FACTS combined with analysis without insight make this book an exercise in pseudo-intellectual flight from reality.
5,Nice intro to the subject,"I think that this book is useful to anyone studying Anglo-Saxon topics. It covers the basic context of the development of Anglo-Saxon England after the fall of Roman Britain through the Battle of Hastings. It provides a fairly good account, in broad generalist terms, of this period in history.This book is primarily a history and as such needs to be seen as such. It is not a deep look at Anglo-Saxon social structures, nor it is a look at Anglo-Saxon ethical culture. However it covers material culture in relative detail as well as what is known about the historical movements, consolidations of power, and the like.The illustrations and photographs in this book are extremely interesting and well organized. Even if the text wasn't great (which it is), the photos would have made the text worth it. I would recommend this work."
3,Very informative but suffers from a dull writing style,"A very informative book with lots of illustrations that suffers from a rather academic, dull writing style. The authors missed an opportunity to bring this period of English history to life in the way that other writers such as Simon Schama can do. Also at times, the writing is characterised by over-long sentences and unecessary detail, when a summary would have sufficed. Yet at other times, a little more relevant detail would have been welcomed. Some of the academic side-issues would have been better placed in the notes at the end of the book. In general, better editing by J. Campbell would have improved matters. Despite the above negative points, I would recommend the book for anybody wishing to learn more about the Anglo-Saxons."
4,"Powerful, but uses lots of electricity","This fan is well built and puts out a very powerful stream of air in one direction. It is large and very heavy weighing about 35 pounds but it has wheels and a telescoping handle that is easy to move around if you don't have to climb stairs. Basically it has a big heavy motor that turns a squirel cage fan by direct drive (no belt). I measured the power consumption and it uses 450 watts on high, 420 mid, and 400 low. That is more power than the blower in the forced air furnace in many houses. I gave it 4 stars because it is bigger and more powerful than I will ever need and even low is loud and too powerful. It would of been better if high was 450 watts, middle was 350 and a quieter and more economical low of 250."
5,Industrial strength,"Industrial strength, great quality. If you need to move air this is the baby. Unbelievable value for the money."
5,Great value for the money,"For an item made in Taiwan, this is surely a high quality piece, exceeded my expectations by far, go for it!"
3,Swedish Synth:,"La Vogue is a combination of Daily Planet's lead singer Jarmo Ollilio and friends. They put together a cool retro style sound in the spirit of early Depeche Mode and Erasure. The analog synths provide lots of filter sweeps and electronic bleeps, while the melodies and vocals are awesome. Sure to please any fan of synth-pop!Tracks: 1. Somebody new 2. Visions of night 3. Criminal dance 4. Wounds are healing 5. Sex robot 6. New revolution 7. Interstellar 8. Today 9. Heaven is waiting 10. A world outside your door"
2,Totally ineffective,This product seems to have no effects or benefits whatsoever.I was dissapointed the the result as I had high hopes based on the product desription.
5,Review for Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney- Justice fro All,This is a great game for those who are interested in visual novels. The story line is wonderful and the cases are perfect. I recommend to any and all gamers.
3,Sequel weaves in the paranormal,"Phoenix Wright Series are classics ...The cherry on the cake would have to be it's original release Ace Attorney.This first sequel ""Justice for all"" makes references to the original stories, weaving a historical thread forward...It takes on a slight paranormal & psychic edge to solving cases, ... there were parts in which I lost interest however, it still has the PW draw."
3,"A good game, but...","Before you play this game, I highly recommend attempting to find a copy of the first game. This game DOES explain how the game's court system works, and you get an idea of what happened in the first game, but it's best to play the first game in order to fully appreciate it.As for the game itself, there are 4 cases instead of 5 in this game- which left me feeling a bit ripped off, as one of the 4 cases is incredibly short, and one does nothing for the story. However, the second case alone makes this game worthwhile(for this price, anyway.)Even with the lack of a case, and two.. not so good cases, this game is worthwhile to play. It is still fun, and, of course, the cases always leave you guessing until the end. I recommend it, but play the first one first."
5,Great Game,"Ace Attorney 2 Justice for All, the sequel to Ace Attorney. I hope I didn't lose anyone yet. This game game is more challenging then the first. It requires use of your mind and a little common sense to get through. The plot and the funny cast of characters will keep you hooked and wanting more even when you finish the game."
3,Phoenix Wright Justice for All,"The game starts off fast and fun, but quickly hits a bump by the second case and greatly slows down. A little boring and repetitive after that, but not a bad game overall."
3,"Not as good as the original, but still fun","I bought this game after playing, and loving the first phoenix wright game, and I'm a little dissapointed. Where the first game was clever and required some thinking, this game is mostly just frusterating. I often find myself having no idea what to do, and just randomly presenting evidence until I find the right item. When I do find the right piece of evidence, it sometimes doesn't make any sense, and there's no way to have known the right thing to do without guessing. That issue aside, it's still a pretty fun game. The new psyche-lock feature adds a new challenge and is very entertaining. The stories are just as ridiculous as before, and I've had a good time playing it. I wouldn't reccomend this game for someone who hasn't played the original phoenix wright, but if you love the series then you'll have a good time."
4,"If you liked ""Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney"" you'll like the sequel","Game play is almost identical to the first game, with the exception of the new ""psyche-lock"" feature that requires you to present evidence when questioning people to find secrets they hide. The game has some great new cases that are both funny and suspenseful, and the psyche-lock adds an interesting new challenge to the game.The only disappointing part about the game is that unlike the first game, there is no ""bonus case"" designed specifically for the DS. Instead it's just a straight GBA port, which is unfortunate because the bonus stage was definitely the most innovative and fun to play in the original. Still, if you enjoyed the first game, you'll enjoy this one."
3,More for anime fans then someone wanting an intricute court environment.,"The issue isn't that it's not American enough, it's just you can't really work with much if you want to present evidence that the creators didn't want you to bring to the judge's attention."
2,Just an ok game,"The game is kinda slow paced, kinda goes in circles. It was pretty cheap, so I guess it was worth it."
5,Phoenix Wright: Fun for All,"Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney - Justice for All is an awesome game. Who would have guessed a game where your a lawyer would be fun? The storylines are gripping, the gameplay is solid and the mix of comedy, drama and action makes this game a must have. Capcom did a great job on this one!"
5,one of the best ds games in my opinion,"i liked the first one better as far as storyline goes but justice for all was great as well. now that i've finished them both, i'm itching for the third one which isnt coming out till september. if you don't like reading, this game isnt for you. to me, the reading was not a hassle or anything because it's the basis of the game. the storylines are great. its like watching anime or something. pearls is so cute."
4,Fans of the original should buy this,"If you liked the previous Phoenix Wright game you should get this. It's basically the same gameplay with new stories. Unfortunately the new stories and characters aren't as interesting as those from the first game. Still, Phoenix fans should buy this sequel."
3,"Better than nothing, not as good as Walsh","I bought many Mausers and tried to sporterize them. Using Keunhausen's book was frustrating because there is informantion there, it is just hard to find. The problems with the book: 1) No clear table of contents 2) Contantly changes the subject only to return later 3) recomends heat treatment after many steps [mistake] 4) recoments recomends milling corroded bolt face [mistake] 5) refers to tooling that exists nowhere [build from photo]Much better is the book ""Mauser M98 & M96 How to build your favorite custom rifle"" by R. A. Walsh"
4,the book,"read the book. it was very good. you must understand that you have to read the book first then apply the knowledge. although it does jump around you must understand it is not a step by step build a custom mauser book. but rather understand and know the rifle first, then buy a book which gives you ideas on how you want your mauser to be. it does not give custom stocks and actions and other stuff. that is up to the person and imagination."
1,This is not a rare book!!,"This book is readily available, NEW, from any number of sellers (like Midway USA) for approx. $30--no reason to treat it like the Guttenberg Bible.The book itself is very good."
5,another treasure trove,"The performancces are so good that one can relax and listen to these fifteen symphonies. #s 55-57 were the final three symphonies of an inspirational streak (#s 52-57). #s 58-69 are more variable. I would rank thefifteen in this set in this descending order: 67, 57, 56, 64, 55, 60, 68, 62, 61, 65,63, 69, 59, 66, 58(#s 58 amd 79 are my least favorite middle period Haydn symphonies). Adam Fischer once again conducts beautifully (see my reviews of his #s 40-54 and 70-81). At present I do not plan to review more from this set-#s 21-39 are a possibility. - (I do love #31 most in that group, would rank #s 22, 26, 30,39 highly)Peers: # 55, 60, 63, 65, 69, 59 (Marriner); #63 (Orpheus); # 62 (Sieghart/Stuttgart CO); #66 (Linde/CapellaColoniensis);#65(Derek Solomons) #67 (Paul Sacher)"
1,wrong product,the set i got was not haydn 55-69. it was however one of the later sets that i had planned to purchase later. but now i will have to purchase what i ordered again so that i can complete my set. my suggestion ; either hire someone that can read or LEARN how to read!
5,The Sauce Boss!,This has got to be one of the best kick you in the face and make you scream for your mamma blues albums. Lordy can that man play!Take it from someone with a great big fanny this album is hotter than two sisters!What a show.
1,tough on baby,"My one-year-old daughter loves this toy, but grins turn to tears pretty fast. Whenever she bumps into anything with the walker (chair, wall, dresser), the walker tips over backwards (there's no counterweight to baby) and my little one falls and hits her head on the floor."
4,good walker for the price!!!,"My 1 year old loves this walker. It was given as a gift and helps her not only to walk but to place shapes into the holes. I do not see her falling while using it, the only drawback is sometimes her hand gets stuck when she tries to lift the place where the shapes enter, but it has only happened a few times. For the price this is a good walker, based on the experience with my child."
2,"Nice sound and precision, but where's the fire?","As always, Perlman handles the technical challenges beautifully, but there is a lack of fire and brilliance that one would expect from a rendition of a work by Brahms. My major complaint with the performance is that the first and third movements are WAY too slow. I almost fell asleep listening to the first. I would suggest Heifetz's performance of Brahms with the Chicago Symphony, conducted by Fritz Reiner. (It is ironic that two performances of Brahms with the Chicago symphony can be such polar opposites.) Heifetz is probably one of the only violinists of the 20th century who could have taken Brahms as fast as he did, but the concerto (esp. the 1st movement) sounds better played faster. In this way, the performance is infused with more fire. After listening to the Heifetz/Reiner recording, I guarantee that you will not be able to listen to most Brahms renditions again."
2,Weak and disappointing,"Perlman is a very fine violinist, but this recording is not one of his best. His virtuosity is clear and pleasant and he has the advantage of being accompanied by the Chicago Symphony. The biggest problem with this recording is that Perlman and Giulini choose a tempo that is far too slow. This is a huge factor which is why this performance is weak and disappointing. Both of these two have done better. Stay away from this however."
5,Great honey pot,"This was an adorable way to serve honey. NO more sticky honey bottles with this clever bee presentation. Adorable on a brunch table, and very practical as well. The adorable little paddle also pours out just the right amount of honey. Clever device."
2,Well...,"I don't know why but I thought this thing would be very nice but it is a mere ""okay"". Glass container part has little chips upon where it is cut. Glass part doesn't align perfectly with the bee body so it is loose...I guess you don't fill it up beyond a 1/4 full? I will say at a glance it does look good but lacking finish and functionality."
4,excellent story collection,"This is a first rate collection of stories of life in a dismal modern exurb of Seoul. The stories share location and characters, and as a whole they form a sort of novel; yet each one stands on its own, focusing on different characters in the town, with their very different perspectives on their generally disappointing and drab lives. In the context of this unity of people and place, the diversity of the stories is remarkable, a pleasure to experience. Among my favorites: ""The Wonmi-dong Poet,"" a description of one of the town's eccentric characters, told from the viewpoint of a 6-year-old girl; ""A Vagabond Mouse,"" the story of a young husband gradually succumbing to the lure of spending all his time on the nearby mountain, told from his standpoint and that of a group of town men; and ""The Tearoom Woman,"" a brief tale of adultery. The translation are smooth and readable. Highly recommended."
2,"A so-so presentation, but better than others...","I tried to find a good CD of National Anthems, this one sounds the best, but still quite dissappointing. The French and USSR/Russia ones are OK but certainly not the best, the rest are really so-so. I am not talking about the songs, they are all great! But the presentation was weak. I guess you have to find the band from their native country to present their own National Anthems, can't count on foreigners :)"
5,"Good service, no surprise",The product arrived damaged in shipment but the merchant promptly sent a replacement. The mouse itself is an addition to many we already use in the office. They are reliable and maintenance free.
2,uncomfortable.,"This mouse works well and is affordable. However, I would not recommend this mouse if you spend an extensive amount of time surfing the internet, gaming, or working in various mouse-intensive applications. I got this mouse a couple months ago at my workplace and it's simply uncomfortable after extended use. I find logitech's designs or microsoft's right-handed designs to be far more ergonomic. In fact, I have switched back to a track ball logitech as my primary mouse at work due to the repetative stress that had been effecting my hand."
5,Beautiful in the dark,"I love it. No having to clean mouse wheels. No cleaning a mouse pad. Can use it on anything. If the lights are out, it makes a lovely red glow like a small night light."
3,Average mouse,"MS could have done better with this mouse. Overall, it performs well but it doesn't feel as solidly built as the mechanical wheel mouse it replaces. The optical mouse is light, very light. A kink in the cord will push the mouse back when you lift your hand. A small metal slug within the mouse body would have given it more heft and better feel in my opinion. The buttons have the same feel as the mechanical version but the wheel is a bit looser in comparison.This mouse has a PS/2 style connector and MS also supplies an adapter to use with a free USB port if you're so inclined. Fit and finish are up to the usual MS mouse standards and it has a generous cord length.A bit more heft and a better scroll wheel would move this mouse from a 3-star to a 5-star performer."
2,poor design,"This mouse is not very good. I was looking for an optical mouse without a whole bunch of buttons, like this one. I got it and was happy with how precise and smooth it is. But it's extremely cheap feeling. It's super light. The buttons feel like they will break after a bit of use, the wheel is so loose it sometimes moves on its own. Microsoft tried to save some money by making this mouse for both righties and lefties. The comfort level is nowhere near that of the old Intellimouse. In my opinion, the Intellimouse is a better mouse, although it requires cleaning the ball out once in a while."
2,It was good until......,"It was a excelent mouse (high precision, usefull, confortable) but it only last 1 year... and i treated very well i do not punch it or anythin like that.... one day while I was on the internet the mouse just turn off and never turn on again in any o my 3 computer... i im very engry about that..."
5,excellent mouse for good price,"Just got this mouse. I used to have the old tear-drop shaped Microsoft mouse. I just got tired of cleaning it on a regular basis and decided to get an optical one.This mouse is working great so far, very responsive, you'd never know it's optical. Design is ergonomic, fits the palm of the hand perfectly. And unlike the Intellimouse, which has extra buttons that I consider totally useless, this model is priced very attractively.I don't know why anyone would want to buy a mechanical mouse!"
4,Works as expected,This is my first optical mouse. It works fine. Plugged it in and it worked without any hassle. I found it moves better directly on the desk vs. a mouse pad. I'm using the PS/2 port. Worth it. Amazon shopping made it easy!
1,Total waste of money,"Don't buy this headset amp. It's my fault, should have read more user reviews - it has one feature that makes the unit useless: has an automatic on / off feature to conserve batteries. However, the unit turns off when it doesn't hear you talk after about 30 seconds. If you are on conference calls for work (which I bought it for) and just listening, it turns off and you can't hear anything on the call. No wat to defeat this option that I am aware of. Awful product design."
2,Very low and cheap quality,I purchased this item and when I was placing its batteries according to its instructions I noticed one of the clips/tiny metal battery holder was broken. This little metal holder should have some flexibility to be adapted to the size of the battery but its quality was not good and it broke. Unfortunately this tiny metal battery holder can not be fixed or replaced once it is broken from its base/contact. I did not get to the point to use it and accordingly I am not able to make a comment about its working quality. As far as I am concern it is not a reliable piece of equipment.
1,Not as advertised,"Everyone is selling these things on Amazon, but leaving out a big chunk of information. They turn off your headset after 10 seconds of not hearing anything. It's an automated VOX setting that you can't turn off. If the volume gets too low it starts chopping off conversations."
2,"Silence-Deactivated, not Voice-Activated...","The high points:* Small* Has a clip on it (I clip it onto the handset)* Battery life seems great (haven't changed it yet)The low, low, low point:* Cuts out when there is a lull in the converation, during hold music, etc. This problem is a real drag."
3,Loud but irritating,"It does a great job of amplifying two-way conversations. The problem is that it has no ""off"" switch--it turns itself off when it doesn't detect sound. So, if you're having a conversation with someone who is a soft speaker (the main reason I bought the thing!) it turns off--and then you hear even less than without it. So I find myself clearing my throat a lot, just to keep it turned on. It's especially disconcerting when on hold--you can't tell if you're still connected."
1,not reliable at all,I tried it out and it just wouldn't do- the voice activation is the problem. I wish they made it without that feature. It kept turning itself off while my daughter was talking to me. Waste of time. Thanks Amazon for being so great with the return policy!
1,Plantronics Mobile Headset MHA-100,"I am currently using the third MHA100 from Plantronics. The first one I ordered from Amazon had an annoying problem of turning off in the middle of a sentence. Returned to Amazon for a replacement which had the identical problem. I called Plantronics & spoke to a technical support specialist, who in turn sent a replacement. This one is by far the best of the three, but it still becomes sporadic during an extended telephone call. I do not recommend this product to anyone!"
3,Not totally satisified,"I found two problems with this product. First it made the audio on my phone sound very tinny. Second, the batteries only lasted a few weeks and after going to both Target and Walmart I've been unable to find replacement batteries which I would have thought would be readily available."
2,When it works - it works great!!!,"The MHA100 is small, compact and easy to use. It works great when the batteries are alive. Since they use THREE Zinc L675ZA hearing aid battereis, they have a limited life (one or two weeks max) once activated by the air. And these puppies are not cheap."
2,Great idea poorly executed,"Overall packaging and funtion good but the automatic on/off function does function effectively. The result is that it turns itself off frequently during a call cutting off the speaker for a second or two. Unfortunately, there is no way to override the switch or to change the sensitivity or threshhold level.A much needed item that I cannot use due to this flaw. It's a shame Plantronics products are usually quite good."
2,Batteries expire almost immediately,"Because the product is touted as being ""voice activated"", I assumed that meant it would drain the batteries only when actually being used. But after my first conversation using the device, I disconnected it from the phone and from the headset, and put it away. Got it out again for another conversation a few days later, only to find out that the batteries were dead.For a while I tried the approach of putting the batteries in immediately before using it, then removing the batteries after the call, putting them in again for the next call, etc. But that was just too much of a hassle.After a bit of experience with that, I stopped using the device."
3,The only product out there,"Looked to be the only thing out there that will amplify a cell phone while you are driving and does just that. I would have liked rechargeable batteries that are removable like AAA batteries. But when you are the only game in town , I guess you make it anyway you want and to heck with the consumer. It took a little longer than I thought it should have to have it shipped to me but the price was the best I have seen. I find I don't use it much as I thought I would and will probably give it to my hard of hearing father when he enters the cellular age."
2,NOT REALLY WORTH IT,"It works, but its draw back is that it turns it self off if the person on the other line pauses for more than 5 seconds. When the person speaks (the amp is voice activated by the person you are speaking to) you miss the first slyabol of what they are saying which casues you to ask them to repeat themsleves continually...which gets real old real quick."
3,agood product but needs longer lasting batteries,I think it will work well once I can get good batteries. the batteries included were old and very weak
2,Plantonics Headset,"This was not what we wanted and we have returned it. Probably ok for mobile phone, but we wanted it for TV use and it didn't work/fit."
1,Not worth it,"I purchased this item one because of price, 2 because it looked easy to use for a senior citizen.Well, it only lasted 2.5 weeks and will not work on any other cell phone.Take my advice and don't order"
2,It works but not very well,"It amplifies and is simple to use but it picks up noise from everywhere. Lights, appliances, everything makes it hum and gets amplified right along with it. Also purchased the Jabra headset with built in amplifier which did NOT have the same problem."
1,One fatal flaw,"This product is good in every way except for one fatal flaw. In order to save battery power the unit is sound activated. When there is a short pause in a conversation, the unit quits working and doesn't start again until the person you are talking to is several seconds into his next sentence. I had one unit replaced by the factory and the replacement has the same problem. If the product had a power switch I would rate it 5 stars."
4,Would be 5 stars except.....,"Like others have said, it doesn't have a manual on/off. Occasionally, when in a call if it gets really quiet, the amplifier will turn off so I have a tendancey to blow lightly in the mic while waiting... just because it's unnerving to hear the line sound like it went dead. Other than that, it really works well. It has more than enough volume for me, and it gives my headset cord that little extra lenght I need."
3,Plantronics Mobile Headset Amplifier,This product is pretty good. The only problem that I had was with this device is it seems to really amplify the noise more than the rest of the sound.
4,Basic amplifier,This is a basic amplifier. It works with standard corded headsets. I use it in my car as I am an old machinegunner with hearing loss. It takes a second to cut in but amplifies well. The batteries are inexpensive online or at Walmart. Best solution out there if your fone is too quiet.
3,OK but has issues,The amplifier definitely works well to amplify the incoming callers voice - however the the caller hears a very bad echo repeating back what they said -- have had to switch it off to hold a conversation.
5,An Angel Here On Earth....,Allison has one of the most beautiful voices I have heard in a long time. It is very refreashing to hear someone with a true passion in what they are doing...
4,Excellent but needs updating,"I taught business writing in the late 1990s and used this as a textbook in my classes. I hope Irwin (or someone) publishes an updated version. The 1994 edition treats email as if it is a new thing, uses some outdated terminology, etc. But the general principles taught by the book remain as relevant as ever. The before/after examples are particularly helpful. Neiditz reduces business writing (indeed, clear communication in general) to its essentials. The book teaches in 200 pages what other books teach in twice that. I hope this excellent volume is updated and not forgotten."
3,rewiew,Just what I expected cheap priced bino's that are fine for my wife to look at stuff from the cabin
4,Great binoculars,They work great and for a very long distance every thing is still really clear. Use them a lot while camping.
4,Very pleased,"After reading some of the reviews left for this item I was a little hesitant. However, I took a leap of faith and purchased them. At first I could only see through one side of the binoculars. After reading the directions I was able to quickly correct the problem. For a compact binocular they work great. The binoculars get 4 stars only because I have to readjust them every time I take them out of the carrying case. If the case was big enough to hold them in the adjusted position they would've got 5 stars."
4,Not bad at all,"This is exactly what I was looking for. The material quality seems good, and they work well. I just wish they came in a hard case. Minus one star for that."
1,Blind man has a better chance,"total waste of timesuggestion for ppl like me, dont waste ur time, spend the extra money and get something that will allow u to actually see objects at a distance."
4,Binoculars,This was a gift for my niece when she was 18 years old. She said to me that it was a very nice gift.
5,Much faster than type M,"If you have a ""fast"" camera there is a big difference between type ""M"" and type ""H"".For me on my Fuji6000FD it takes about half the time when taking a RAW image compared to type ""M"" cards.Really big difference."
5,Corona Alona,"Wonderful collection, worth twice its retail value for ""Crashing At Corona"" alone (on disc 2). Beautiful melody, mysterious lyrics. Even after three dozen listens, it continues to shiver the spine. Enjoy."
2,Storm Hymnal CD,"There was only about 4 songs I actually liked on this cd. I'm still trying to get used to some of the others, but the sound quality is not good. I would have been better off just downloading the one song on here that I originally wanted, which was ""Happiness""."
2,game projector dissapointing,"At first when I got this to play my x-box on, I thought it would be very neet. But it wasn't. It had horrible pixels and showd lots of grain. It also was not bright at all. It was just dull and you could not see words very well at all. Therefor I was not able to understand what was going on in my game. The fan is another big issu because it was so loud. It's very hard to enjoy the movie you're watching or the game you're playing. After all I was very dissapointed and advise you that this product is aful!"
1,~~Don't waste your money!~~DoesNOT hook to TV or DVD player or VHS! Misleading Title!~~,Be WARNED!No it does not play dvds or cds. This projector hooks to your xbox or ps2 or gamecube. Does not hook to the television at all. So you cannot even hook this to your dvd player or vhs. It is a very big waste of money and a very big dissappointment. I wasNOT impressed. I was very diappointed. The picture w/ this projector is very grainy. AWFUL Projector! I originally bought it because my son always enjoys closing the shades and watching tv in the dark and enjoys the cinama feel ... but I totally regret getting this. Don't buy it or you will regret it too.You should go w/ the zoombox.
1,Really!,Fleeced is how I feel. I've read all of this lady's books and I keep hoping she will mature into someone of a similar talent as her mother. With this book I give up! Cardboard characters with cutsey-pie names and a total absence of plot combine to make this a waste of time and money. This is definitely somone who would not be published if it were not for Mommy.
2,Not as good as her other books,"I am a fan of Carol Higgins Clark and Mary Higgins Clark, but I was pretty disappointed with this book. While I enjoy Carol's humor and her quirky characters and plot lines, she went a bit over the top with this storyline. Stuffed sheep with diamonds in their eyes? Competitors trying to sabotage a butlering school? Ugh. Lots of loose ends at the end too."
2,Nepotism At Its Finest,"It's obvious that this author has only made it to the big show because of her mother. Each installment of this series has gotten worse, to the point they're barely tolerable anymore.The characters are never really fleshed out, and with the connection of Regan and her novel-writing mother, all you can do is picture the Higgins Clark women, since there's nothing to tell you otherwise about them. The writing is also very poor, often seeming very juvenile. And too many supporting characters makes for a very confusing story.The author really needs to work on her writing skills. She's already a step ahead, having the in to get herself published. She should take the time to use that chance to her advantage."
3,A Good &Pleasant Read,This is my first official Carol Higgins Clark that I have read. While I was disappointed in the past with her collaborations with her mother. I really like Fleeced I couldn't put it down storyline was nice. She will never be on the same caliber as her mother. But she has her own style. Which is great.
2,Good plot idea,"Carol (no relation) Higgins Clark is no match for her mother. This was a good idea for a plot, but very badly written. Characters are shallow and dialogue totally predictable. Everything falls conveniently into place with no subtlety whatsoever."
1,5 Pages for $3.95,This is awful ... to charge someone for five pages ... an introduction to what a book?? ... I expected more (at least 20 pages) and am very relunctant to order anything from amazon again.
3,Meetings,Meetings can be a tremendous waist of time if not conducted properly. Simple but most business professionals need help in this area.
1,Waste of time and money,"Absolute junk, you could think of this yourself. Do not waste your time with this."
2,Expected better,"I needed some large, strong binders to hold documents for my boss. I ordered three of these binders. It seems like they would be decent binders if they were new, but unfortunately the ones shipped to me arrived very dirty/dusty, scratched up, and looking as though they had already been used. I am fairly disappointed with this purchase."
5,Don't Miss This One!,"Elmer Bernstein is one of the most prolific and talented film composers ever, and some of his best soundtracks are on this CD. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" will evoke images of the children in the film, Jem and Scout, to your mind. The soaring triumphant crescendos from ""Hawaii"" will bring tears to your eyes. I've often thought that the theme ""Hollywood and the Stars"" should be played at the Academy Award ceremony each year, because when I heard it, I thought it would be very fitting as a tribute to all the stars that had passed away, and it was very emotional. I wish that other Bernstein tracks were available in their entirety, such as ""Desire Under the Elms"". In the meantime, this one is excellent and one that will give you a great deal of enjoyment."
1,Here We Go Again!,"Another potentially good novel is spoiled by the author's insistence on having Holmes fall in love. Unfortunately, she is not the first (and probably will not be the last) to inject this non-canonical element into a story."
4,Pig Out!,"This is very amusing, as well as instructive; I found its humor as important to the book as its potential educational value. Sure, you get all kinds of opportunities to count money, make change, convert nickels, pennies, dimes, and quarters--but there's much more!Great big colorful pictures that can be enjoyed en toto or through the (sometimes hidden) details, abundant irony and sloth, and, yes, a wonderfully creative menu (with food descriptions and prices) from the ""Enchanted Enchilada,"" the restaurant where the pigs pig out after a money hunt in their cluttered home. Your kids may even get a new, humorous, appreciation for the words ""this room looks like a pigsty!""This is all good-natured, non-preachy fun for younger elementary school kids. It's a fun way to practice simple math problems, as well as just a good story filled with color and imagination."
3,Alexandra D Pima Student Tucson,"I read this book to a group of kindergarten students. Right now they are learning about money just coins they know penny,dime and nickel. Some of the students were able to point out the coins and do some of the adding with the pig family. But majority of them just enjoyed the pictures and the storyline. They were unable to follow the hidden math problem. But overall it is a fun story to read with the students."
4,Great math book for kids,This book is a great math book for kids. It is a great tool for teaching children about money. It has lots of diffrent types of money problems. It would be a wonderful to read the book with a child or a classroom of students and then work out the problems in the story.I read this book to a second grade class during the school's love of reading week. The students enjoyed the book and I could see them working the problem out in their heads. This book made the students think.Though this book is a great teaching tool for money it does lack in a plot. There is no real climax or major issue to solve. The story line is basically the Pigs need to find money to eat and that is it.
3,Great book for money beginners,"This story isn't entertaining for a younger child, but is a good tool in learning money. The pig family searches the house to find money so that they can go out to eat. At the end of the book, there is a page that shows each amount of money that the pigs found, and how much they found total. If your child is learning to count money, this would be a nice book to aid them."
5,Pigs Will Be Pigs,I loved this book! The kids I read it to also loved it. They really got into it. They tried to guess how much money the pigs would find and they were adding up the money as the pigs found it. They liked the menu when the pigs were at the restaurant because they were pretending that they were ordering too. But they were also figuring what the pigs could order to not go over their budget. They really enjoyed the drawings. I would recommend this book for kids because it's fun and educational.
3,I won't be buying this product again,"The serum itself is very good but the pump dispensers don't work well. I have had 2 defective pumps in the last 18 months, both breaking before even half of the serum was used. I tried getting a replacement but was told the company won't credit me for a ""used"" product. Too expensive to keeping throwing away so I'll look for another Vitamin C serum."
5,Great product,I definitely noticed brighter and younger looking skin after a couple of weeks of regular use of this twice daily.
3,Alright,"Fun film, good effects, great for your kids. Needs wide screen, true HD, and a subtitle option to be really worth the money though."
2,Not quite worthless,"I ordered this book primarily as a filler to get free shipping. As such, it did the trick perfectly. Otherwise the china dollis pretty bad. The doll is printed on cardboard, but the outfits, of which there are eight, are printed on paper similar in weight to copy paper. Nothing is perforated at all, making for substantial work cutting things out. This will not last more than a day or two. Sure, this is only $1.50, but I do not think it is even worth that."
5,visceral and brave,"I am guilty of formulated music patterns that are melodic and resolved. After listening to Pal lyrically and musically, I understand algebra a little more. The Morning After is a real gem for any artisan to listen to and be inspired by. The song"" Teddy Bear"" blends Jules Shear and Pal together perfectly. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who is in a rut creatively because Pal is a kick start for inspiration."
3,Shipping and Handling,"Overall, I am very happy with the product I purchased, however, while I was checking out I noticed that I was paying an large shipping fee from the seller. I was confused by this until the package came, then I understood. These clips, came in the largest box possible, it was ridicilous, especially when they would have mailed a lot easier in a ups envelope. What a waste of money! Even the nail polish I ordered came in an envelope and that's more fragile than these!"
3,Thespians please apply for a job with the developer...,"The graphics and sound in this game are beautiful; they help you to believe you are in another world. The acting and narration, however, brings you crashing right back down to earth and effectively ruins the atmosphere. Yikes!-- talk about some serious spoilers! I haven't cringed at acting that bad since I caught a glimpse of a high school play on public access cable. I could have handled mediocre acting- no one expects an Oscar performance from a video game, but this was beyond horrible. It truly is amazing how much the poor quality ""acting"" detracts from what would otherwise be a wonderful game."
1,"Frustration, thy name is Schizm","I bought this game for the graphics, and I must say they are stunningly beautiful. The problem is you don't get to see all of them unless you solve these ridiculous puzzles, and after only a few hours, I've given up on it. It's one thing to want to present the gamer with a challenge, but I don't believe you can get through this game without a walkthrough and cheat sheet, and using one all the time is just plain annoying. It takes all the fun out of it. Furthermore, if I wanted to spend all my time learning symbols and equations, I'd go back to high school math class. And it wasn't enough to have to learn new symbols and number base systems, they had to add sound and color to the puzzle mix. Enough is enough. Who are they trying to impress ? Give us a break Dreamcatcher and give us a beautiful game we don't have to tear our hair out to get through."
1,disapointing on all acounts,"I first bought the cd version of this game and was shocked at how poor the quality of the graphics were. I then decided to give the DVD version a try because that used hardware acceleration and it should look better. It did look better but was still a little choppy. Another problem I had was that you couldnt install the DVD version so that you could run it off of the hard drive, so when I am playing the game the dvd rom is running all of the time and is loud so i have to turn the volume up. Third, the acting is incredibly terrible in this game. Finally, I had a lot of trouble even playing the game because sometimes my dvd rom couldn't read the disc. This has never happened before and all the DVDs or CDs ive ever put into it worked fine. I am going to return this game on Monday and hopefully get my money back. If you like the Myst style adventure games then you should try Myst 3: Exile. That is an excellent game. However, stay as far away as possible from Schizm!"
1,Impossible Puzzles But Incredible Graphics,"How do you make lemonade out of this lemon? The graphics on the DVD-ROM version are great, but the puzzles were next to impossible to figure out. I consider myself semi-intelligent when it comes to playing games where puzzle solving is involved, but this game made me feel stupid. I ended up buying the solutions guide for the DVD-ROM version just to save my sanity. Without that guide I would never have made it through most of the puzzles. The puzzles are not logical at all and the acting stunk. I've played several Dreamcatcher games and this is the first one I've been dissappointed with. Save your money and move on to something the average gameplayer has a chance with. Playing this game was a monumental waste of my time!!!"
2,Don't bother with this one,"Obviously this book is considered for beginners, but if you really are a beginner, it will just lead you in the wrong directions. And if you're experienced, then you'll be shaking your head at some of the stuff written. While there are some nice pictures, even that is organized badly because you have to flip about 10 pages over to see the picture of the plant being discussed. The plant profiles section is very short and almost useless, especially the ""Similar plants"" category, which is very inaccurate. And there's not one mention of Aponogetons, or some other very common aquarium plants. Save your money for something better. I bought this and returned it for a full refung 3 days later. If you're looking for a quality, cheap beginners book, get Scheurmann's Aquarium Plants Manual instead."
2,Not what I was expecting,"The book has beautiful images, but I was expecting more elaborated instructions. For example: The picture in the cover is beautiful but when you go inside the book to learn how to recreate something like that, it only teaches you how to color feathers... And the situation repeats itself on almost every tabletop idea."
5,Awesome!,"I grew up on NES and SNES, so seeing these games with new graphics and some bonus features was a very nice surprise for me. I had just as much fun playing through this game as I did playing FFII for SNES. Fortunately there were some improvements made in the dialogue, which made it much easier to follow and the characters a little deeper. Square added in some items and extra equipment. Also, you have the option to switch between all the characters towards the end of the game, which gives the game a new flavor. There are some small bugs in it, but most don't hurt the gameplay too much. The only downfall of this remake is that they took away the weapon-doubling cheat... :-( Thus, no more stacks of 99 Excallibur swords for Edge to throw..."
5,So Sweet!,"I too heard ""Colors"" on the Dell commercial and went to Amazon to learn more about the song. I was ecstatic to find out it was from a kid's yoga CD because I'm a yoga teacher. I downloaded the whole album; it's perfect! Thank you Kira Willey!"
3,it was ok,"this was my first christmas on my own, i looked at many trees to try and find the best one, i found this one and the price was amazing and it was shipped to me fast. when i got it and set it up half the lights did not work, the needles where falling off(im still picking them up) and it is not as full as it looks. after playing with is for about in hour i got the lights to work, but it still does not change my mind about this tree. don't waist your money spend then extra money one a good tree that will last a lone time, it totally worth it."
4,It was a good gift,"I got this for my son for Christmas. He loved opening this up and seeing all the super hero movies, the only thing that we did not like is that there was a dvd in there with just comics on it that you couldn't even read. We thought it was a dvd of another cartoon, so it was kind of dissapointing. Other than that! The movies are great, and my son almost has the whole Marvel collection, so that helped out alot!"
2,Duplicate Copies,I purchased this Marvel Heroes Collection and did not open it until recent. I found that this collection had a duplicate copy of X2 (I'm missing X-Men 3). How can this happen is beyond me! I have notice that this is happing more often as I continue to purchase other sets. The price was great but since I waited so long to open it I can't even send it back. I advice anyone buying a set to open it immediately and check to make sure all movies are there.
1,No Middle Ground,"Books, cd's, movies, clothing, make-up...societal residue. You can't teach someone to be a TRUE goth, no more than you can turn a straight person [to an alternative life style]. Some of us were born gothic, and others have goth potential that just comes later. But attempting to look goth on the outside isn't as nearly as important as being goth inside, right down to your little black heart. Not all goths are easily spotted...we don't all dress in black constantly...we don't all hang out in graveyards and love Lestat. A lot of us who are gothic in mind, heart, and soul are the backbone of the goth culture, and don't find it necessary to exploit such a wonderful, dark aspect by selling out for profit and societal gratification, as is widely (and sadly) embraced in today's world."
2,Erh?,"Well, a nice hod'de do and what the hell, the book to me seems to explane the ""Glowin the dark fangz, and, plastic halowwen caped, M. Manson's kids that plage the word! Yes it explanes them very well, however Gothic is not such, i doubt many wrighters could explane what it is to ""be"" gothic, lord know you dont 'turn into one', it is descoverd inside ones self. Therefore hell to wright about, so if you want to know about all thoes kids who run areound with black greese pait from last hallloween on there eyes and excsivly use the tem ""Blah"" (in a Bella La Gossie (sp?) way) ..go on read about it. Maybe one of thes little Manson kids will tell you what ""clan"" there in.... seriosely if you want to know about the Gothic culture go get youresef a older goth who want to talk, this book is a waist of time & money."
4,Death to Music Snobs,"Don't listen to the smartass below, there is considerably more to Popol Vuh than this album, good as it is. I would roughly section their career as follows:1970-72 - electronic 1972-73 - ""new age"" style devotional music 1974-77 - electric guitar based ""rock"" 1978-87 - acoustic/vocal based 1987- return to electronic musicThere are great albums in all of these periods, except the final and current period. Try these for size: ""Einsjager und Siebensjager"", ""Herz aus Glas"", ""Tantric Songs"", ""Sei still...wisse ICH BIN"", ""Agape-Agape"". And be assured that many more people than Mr. Moon below and the irritating Mr. Cope have heard Popol Vuh and this album."
5,Gritty underground Fire!,"Yo! I just heard this whole cd and it was blowin my mind. The joints with JUICE on Verbal Warfare and K-solo on Knock'em Out is great. I recommend anyone who likes that raw grimy music cop this cd. I was already a fan of Mozes crew ""The Rec Center"" (""Lonely People"" cd) and this just keeps on showin why my head keeps noddin. Go get this cd!!!....Peace"
2,Still doesn't work for me.,"I was dissapointed in the first edition of this book because it was little more than a big list of things. This edition is not much better. It gives more information about the tools, which was sorely missing in the first version, bit still it requires too much work on our part to see what tool fits the job.As a definitive list of all the security tools you could use for Linux, this is a good book, however you better expect to investigate each on your own. If you're looking for a book that is more geared to teaching you as well as overviewing products, I suggest Hacking Linux Exposed or Real World Linux Security. The former is probably the better of the two, but both are better than this one.I'm happy to see that the author has de-anonymized himself somewhat, though."
5,Exciting Dynamic Beat from Africa,"With acoustic guitar and a driving beat, Daby Toure alternately excites and soothes, and never bores. Enthralling and varied tunes and rhythms suitable for both careful listening and background. An impressive artist opens his heart and soul."
2,YOUR TRADING CARD MAKER,Not what I thought it was. Have not used it since I purchased it. Doesn't seem to be able to be used with regular photo paper.
4,Trading Card Maker,Recived when promissed in perfect condition. found it easy to use with step by step instructions every thing it says it is.
5,Extremely Satisfied,"This was such an easy program to use. I found it to be very straight forward and intuitive. The cards I have printed so far look fantastic. My wife and I can't wait to create trading cards for my sons little league team :)I've been looking for a piece of software like this for a very long time. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has a printer, a child, and an imagination."
5,A great piece of software for the kids,My son absolutely loves this product. He makes trading cards for his Hockey Team and has a blast doing so. It's very easy to use and the cards print out very nicely. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has kids in youth sports.
5,photographs & interviews with crossdressers & families,"This book is the first to show crossdressers in everyday life, in relationships, with a positive attitude about their lives. It offers a wide variety of personal stories from the point of view of crossdressers, spouses, and children. The photographs are touching, sensitive, warm."
4,Stories that remaind you of AESOP fables,"Short stories and references that give you a good way to understand your fears, thoughts and reasons for feeling in certain ways. A great book to reflect on our own."
1,Total Crap!,"This game is just flat out DUMB! Everything about this game is bad.The graphics are down right terrible.I've seen better looking graphics on the ps one.The game modes are VERY limited.All you can do is play a crappy story mode,which is a waste of time,and play one on one matches over and over again,in lame background areas.Why would I wanna ""backyard"" wrestle in a burger joint? The wrestlers are just laughable to look at it.Pass on this game.It's not even worth a dollar in my opinion.If you want a really good wrestling game for ps2,pick up WWE Smackdown Vs Raw 2011,and leave this piece of crap alone!"
2,Worst Next Generation Wrestling videogame ever!,"Back in 2006 i was looking for another quality ps2 wrestling game outside of thq's famed smackdown series,sadly this game was'nt it.Despite utilizing a similiar graphics engine as the aforementioned series(smackdown)byw2 is marred by characters with zero facial animation and cartoony looks,laughable physics engine(where female wrestlers can lift male wrestlers with utter ease),no multi-wrestler match ups(triple threat,tag-team,fatal 4 ways,etc)poor hit detection and dualshock usage(only responds when performing or on the receiving end of attack throws).Aside from the 50+music tracks,in-game movies and video clips there's nothing remotely else of interest about this game.If you want a hardcore-theme wrestling game try the PS1 version of EA's WCW Backstage Assault, it's the 32-bit equivaliant of this game,though slightly better!"
1,Video Game,"I received this game and it did not work. So I contacted the seller and he refunded my money and apologized for the inconvenience, which I thought was great. That was very honorable."
3,same as #1,"this is a great game, unlike the first one the gameplay is much better. the game is lacking better graphics but the weapons and areas are much better than the first. there are different moves but the game is pretty much the same. if u already have the first one (backyard wrestling: dont try this at home) then dont get this one it will be a waste. i rate this game 3 out of 5 stars"
4,Fine Recording of a Familiar Chestnut,"Sir Thomas Beecham was well-known for his fondness for colorful music. He was outstanding in French and Russian repertoire (as well as in Sibelius, of course). This is probably the finest available recording of Rimsky's often-recorded chestnut (competition includes Ansermet's famous account on Decca), though the 1950s sound isn't quite up to some recent accounts by Russian orchestras. All in all, though, this is highly recommended,and the mid-range price makes it very attractive."
5,A Peerless Work,"Scherezade is one of my favorite symphonies. With it's MANY journeys, sweeping, langerous melody lines, and steadfast determination it is certainly a work of a Milliunium, not a century! This symphony must be in EVERY classical collection. As essential as Beethoven, Dvorak, etc. The ""dances"" are well chosen, and further document the talent of Rimsky-Korsakov. How strange that in RK's autobiography, he spent one page on this composition, said that his ""Espanol"" was nothing more than an ""exercise"" for musicians, and spent the remaining 500 plus pages to his sailing experiences! You can certainly hear ALL of those experiences in SCHERAZADE."
4,Very useful for tremere players,"This is an excellent book for Tremere players. Being potentially the most powerful clan requires careful adjudication both player and storyteller alike to keep them in check. This is done through the clan weakness (clan bondage). The detailed description of the clan structure, hierarchy and goals assists storytellers in preventing tremere players from dominating the game while providing appropriate challenges for the player at the same time.I would have liked to have seen more on the gargoyles and homonculi (doesnt every tremere players want a gaggle of gargoyles at their beck and call). More on the summoning and control of demons etc would have been useful as well. It fits in with the tremere ""we take risks to achieve power"" mentality that led them to the formation of a clan as a whole.Overall a very good piece of work. Whith the guide to the camarilla and this book, a tremere player has everything they need to develop a very well rounded, appropriate charater."
4,Tremere Sourcebook review,"I thought it was well writen book it had a lot of good info for playing what is in my humble opinion the best clan of the Kindred. It could have included more about the history of the Tremere {EG:Why Tremere chose Saulot to commit Amaranth upon}, But other then that it was a great Book and for any Serious Vampire The Masquerade player it is a must."
1,Even worse than the Lasombra!!!,"Please, don't even get me started on these ""I'm so great because I think I know magick"" [insert vulgar insult here]'s! I only wish I could give this book a star with all the points rubbed off!"
4,the Warlocks of the kafir,"Warlocks, witches and wretched souls full of foul thoughts, the hexers of the Tremere have caused us great pain. Pay they shall, as they are the only hope of the munafiqun ever to overcome Haqim and his rafiq. But be aware, as thou shalt always know thy enemy and be careful not to let them know too much about thee. Drink the Blood and become One. Drink their wretched blood and seek vengeance for the Curse. Only an Ended Tremere is a good Tremere.-Uther Algaan, Assamite Elder"
3,"Good, with serious flaws.","Now, dont get me wrong, I am a serious Tremmy Fan, and I was truly impressed with what it said about Clan history, facts, rumours, and the inter power games. The Tremere Code was pretty interesting too, and even the section in the back describing the councilors worked quite well <Meerlinda fan myself>. What I was truly dissappointed in however, is that The new Rituals, Paths, and variant clan concepts were lacking. Badly. In that sense, the book didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. However, as I said, it for the most part is extremely useful."
2,Its alright,"I play mostly Ravnos, Assamite, and Toreador, lately Gangrel, but in the begining I only played Tremere, even if things have changed. I bought this book just to add to my collection even if it was good, I can not say I was impressed enough to want to add a Tremere back in my character sheets. I guess I expected too much and the literary context wasn't the best but then again the fictional stories in all the white wolf books usually upset me, by there lack of story telling. The add ons where nice it is necessary if you play a tremere I think to add a little spice to perfect you character but if not don't bother."
5,Spans the age gap.,Great story! It spans the age gap--my son loaned it to me and I couldn't put it down. Alot of heavy questions wraped up in a delightfully colorful story. I like that Gardner doesn't try to answer or pass judment on the questions his story raises--just asking is more thought provoking than preaching. A good read.
1,"Please, Spare me the stupid male and dowdy Female charcters","I loved this intriguing tale of your sexual preferances, but the characters were just extremely stupidly dull. I hated them. How much more stick like could you get? They had no imagination, and were above all selfish which made them horrible to read about.You know, bad characters can ruin a great story, that shows in this book"
3,"Not bad, not great","The story is really simple and limited, but Gardner still makes it interesting, and there is some action. It's not bad if you like his other books, but it's a little slower and not as carefree and fun. His other 3 books are better than this one. It takes place in the same future, but has different characters and is more limited in scope."
3,"Great book, bad ending","I was quite enthralled by this book, couldn't put it down. It had a lot going for it until the last chapter. Then I felt let down by the lack of resolution of the main idea of the book. I guess if it was meant to lead to a sequel, it'd be OK, but as a stand alone book, the ending left me flat."
2,"Weak compared with the other ""League of Peoples"" novels","I've enjoyed all of the Explorer Corps novels as well as ""Trapped"" but had been hesitant to purchase this book since it's publication. After recently re-reading all of the preceding, I decided to take a chance on it and was disappointed. Unlike the other novels, ""Commitment Hour"" seemed rambling - despite an interesting premise - and I found the ""reveal"" and ending most unsatisfying.I quite like the ""League of Peoples"" universe (and hope to see more stories set there), but this one fell completely flat for me in terms of both the story and characters. As such, this is the only of Gardner's novels I wouldn't recommend."
5,Great for new swimmers!,Our son loves these dive rings. He has just learned how to dive and is using this to touch the bottom of the pool. It provides entertainment for all the kids in the pool.
4,"Good ¿what if¿ story, but predictable","The Nail is a relatively good story and worth the reading. It could have been less predictable. It takes a &#65533;Marvel&#65533; slant about &#65533;meta-humans&#65533;, which made it predicable to some extent. The characters are consistent with the 70s aspect of their development. It is a self-contained story with no continuity subplots, so it&#65533;s an easy read."
2,Good art Bad story,"Originally presented in three individual volumes. The artwork of alan davis was never in question, however the story was billed as a world without superman? So, how absurd was the ending of the story where the ""world without superman"" was saved by, none other than,...superman. Go figure. On the plus side the two stars I gave the book were earned by Hal Jordan (Green Lantern) and Hawkwoman two characters that turned in wonderful performances."
5,Great mini series,"I would have to rate this mini series as the most powerful one to date. I remember being aloud to stay up and watch it when I was about 14 to watch it. I purchased it to watch it with my soon to be teenage son. It is like watching it for the first time, because I don't remember it all that much."
2,Roots - the complete collection,The product was packaged beautifully but when viewing the CD they was a delay between the speaker and the sound so the quality was very bad in my opinion.I was very disappointed with the quality.
3,DVD Purchase,"DVD set arrived in a timely fashion. Two of the disc's had marking/scratches on them. The seller stated that the DVD's all had been tested and played as they should. Two of the disc's played well in the beginning but as it got farther into the disc, play halted, started up again and halted many times. Had to skip through quite a bit of the story on that disc. That said.....once again seeing the story of Alex Haley's how his ancestor's were treated was indeed an eye opener. I would recommend this set to anyone."
4,antique,i loved learning about my ancestory. although one of my disc skip it is a valuable purchase to me.
4,discs scratched,"I was satisfied with my purchase, after all they were second hand. The only thing is that almost all discs (if not all) have little scratches on them which causes the movie to stop, perhaps 2 - 6 times per disc. This was not mentioned in the ad. I probably would have bought a different one if the scratches was included in the product description."
1,One of the disk was bad,I started watching the collection when all of a sudden one of the disk was dysfunctional at the end of it. I was extremely disappointed. Some of the disk had glue on it from packaging. I am still waiting for UPS to pick to package up. I really wanted to enjoy the collection during the holidays.
2,B. DUKE,"I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH LOOSE AND DAMAGED DISCS. THE ROOTS SAGA IS A WONDERFUL STORY, BUT TIME WARNER'S LOUSY CHOICE OF PACKAGING RUINED WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT SET!"
1,Don't buy from this seller,"It's the complete DVD collection of ROOTS.It's an excellent story overall although the last 3-4 episodes of next generation are of less story and acting quality.But that's not the problem here, it's the seller: Do not buy at least DVDs from GOLD TRADER USA.I contacted them twice, they never anser and most than half of the DVDs are scratched to a point that they are not even viewable ! and yes I bought the collection box NEW !!!Again do yourself the favor: DO NOT BUY from GOLD TRADER USA.your friend."
1,Roots - The Complete Collection,"I received the DVD set in good time and thank Amazon for that, but the double sided DVD's arrived in cardboard sleeves and the first part (Roots), were moving loosely out of their grooves with the result that all 3 DVD's are scratched and one side of one DVD is unwatchable - it stops part through and won't proceed. Roots the Next Generations is also double sided; however, the discs were in their correct place in the sleeve and, having watched the first disc through, they are perfect. Should I find any other defects I will contact you, but would like the set of Roots replaced."
4,Nice set Just prefer Standard packaging,Great miniseries and happy to have it all in a limited number of disks. My preference would be to have it in a different storage format so I can store it with my other DVDs instead of finding a logical way of storing such an odd shaped box. A great set to have and I have enjoyed the series itself.
3,Roots the Next Generation,I would have been happy with my order BUT disc 4 of Roots the Next Generation is missing. I have sent 2 e-mails stating that I would like the last disc to be sent to me. I received to copies of disc 2 and would like to exchange it for disc 4 but I can't find the return address nor has anyone responded to me.
1,Roots,"All the discs of Roots voice sound did not match the lips of the actors. The discs also would pause a few seconds as a freeze of the movie then start up again. I want to exchange this package for another.Please email me on how to go about this process.Thank you so much,Gwen"
5,i dont know what you mean,best ever would recommend it to anyone my family is viewing it now its just great. i don't no what else to say
5,Wonderfully Acted,I have seen the original roots and I got this to see the other 2 seasons that are out. I am very happy with my purchase.
1,Teacher Man: A Memoir,"Don't waste your money or your time on this book. While Mr. McCourt's first two books were wonderful, this one is just depressing. If you really want to read it, go to your public library. I donated my copy to a local used bookstore's free box. It's just not good enough to give to a friend."
2,Can't get through this!,"I am forcing myself to get through Teacher Man. I find the writing very random and frankly boring. Mr. McCourt seems to have such low expectations for his students. I'm really not sure what they do in class exactly. When Mr. McCourt wrote about Kevin, the behavior problem, I kept waiting for him to have a major impact on his life, but all he did was have him wash out paint jars!! I'm tired of reading about Mr. McCourt's own life. I thought this was going to be a book about how he inspired New York students but I was mistaken."
2,C+,"Frank McCort should have stopped writing his life story after Angela's Ashes, his incredible childhood memoir. Both Tis and Teacher Man pale in comparison. In them, we read about a Frank McCort who is a real slacker, adrift professionally and personally, and without the splendid back-up cast provided by his mother, father, brothers and sisters, as well as the Catholic church and school system. His sense of humor and lively Irish wit have disappeared. Teacher Man is a real disappointment."
2,Not His Best,"This is simply average. Although I found some of the stories entertaining, it was hard to stay motivated to keep reading the entire book."
4,Call me goofy but I liked it,It's honest and genuine... a career in the classroom with all that entails (before NCLB)... makes a fellow proud to be a teacher.
2,Puzzling,"I am puzzled by this book. The first paragraph stated McCourt's pride over having made something of himself after a terrible childhood. He then proceeds to tell the story of his teaching as part of this. He admits himself that he felt like a fraud much of the time. I can see why! Most of the anecdotes cover stories of his childhood and he admits to not having control over the students. (He seems to waver between intense pride and self loathing.) Although I enjoyed many of his anecdotes(the assignments to write a suicide note, a excuse note to God from Eve, and reading recipes to music), I spent a lot of time wondering how he could have been a wonderful teacher and had kids flocking to the classroom. I must assume that there is something key to McCourt's charming classroom manner that he left out."
2,Worthwhile but flawed,"This book refreshingly relates the realities of teaching. Rather than offering a ""quick fix"" sappy story, as do so many stories of teaching, the book outlines McCourt's gradual metamorphosis into a good teacher. It was pretty tough going at the beginning, though. McCourt's derogatory view of women as nothing but sex objects was tiresome to endure as he told tales of his sexual escapades. His ""chip on the shoulder"" attitude to college professors - who work every bit as hard as he does - was offensive. His tales of his teaching at technical schools was a bit mystifying: did he ever actually teach anything, or simply read at his desk while they chatted? The book gets a lot better toward the end, as McCourt hits his stride in creative writing classes at an elite high school. Is the moral of his story that good teachers need good students?"
3,Quotation marks?,"Quatation marks? A great book, but very hard for me to read since it had no quotation marks. I couldn't tell who was talking. What happened to quotation marks????"
5,"""The bell rings and they sprinkle me with confetti""","""What was there to write about?"" Before he wrote the bestselling, Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir in his mid-sixties, ""Angela's Ashes,"" the late Frank McCourt taught English and writing in the NY school system. He shares the joys and frustrations of his thirty years in the profession in ""Teacher Man,"" warts and all. He learns what his students have to teach him, and finds poetry in unlikely places (including recipes). ""The bell rings and they sprinkle me with confetti. I'm told to have a good life."" and then he's retired. And I missed ""Teacher Man"" already. I listened to the audiobook; McCourt (who is author as well as narrator) could have gone on at least twice as long on the ups and downs of his teaching career for my liking."
5,Holy mackrel!! Kids NEVER change!!!!!!!,"I read this book as a high school English teacher who loved Angela's Ashes, and, as a by product, fell in love with Frank McCourt's style and charm. Teacher Man does not disappoint. His style and charm are all over the book, but, for me, the compelling part of the story are his experiences with his students. I find it amazing that the same kids who sat in his classes in 1958 are the same ones that sit in my classroom in 2006!! Proof to me that kids are kids, no matter what! There's something so universal and tender in the the way that students and teachers relate to one another. I'm so glad to have the joy of sharing this profession- warts and all- with someone like Frank McCourt and the countless others who will never write a book about their experiences. This is a great read-for everyone who's connected to a kid who's going to or has been in school."
2,parent of a teacher,"Being the parent of a teacher , high school sciences , I bought this book for her. Having read his other books I could not help but read this one before I gave it to her. After she read it she also thought that every teacher everywhere should read it."
2,EH,"Good thing it's a short book. The only worthwhile chapters were the last two, and the last chapter only had 2 words. Did not engage me at all. Your time is better spent on something else."
1,Boring,"One of the most boring books I've ever read. I had to force myself to keep on reading, then when I started just skipping large sections of it I knew it was time to quit. I didn't finish it and I'm not sorry!"
1,MEMOIRS OF A TEACHER,"Frank McCourt captures the pathos, frustration,humor and finally the satisfaction, of a dedicated and accomplished teacher."
4,very good indeed,"I quite enjoyed this work. A memoir like no other. Very well written, too. Highly, highly recommended"
2,McCourt,"Unfortunately, he exposed the dominent Irish attitude--""pride full stubboness."" Fortunately for him, he shed his resentments, accepted himself then, put what talents that he had to good, constructive use.It was gloomy reading, but he made some satisfying points."
5,Highly entertaining,This is a very funny book that tackles some tough issues. I highly recommend the audio version with Frank himself reading. You'll love his accent and inflection; a truly gifted storyteller. Absolutely not necessary to be an educator to enjoy this book...
3,An average read,"This was my first time to read a Frank McCourt book. He sparked my interest when I saw him talk about the bologna sandwich incident on a morning news show. See? All of those talk show interviews pay off. Anyway, I was somewhat disappointed to find that the sandwich story was just about the only one that was worthwhile to even talk about. The rest of the book flows in a sort of ho-hum manner. As a college graduate working my way into the education field, I could relate to Mr. McCourt, but I wasn't dying to turn the page and see what happens next."
2,Disappointing,"I liked his other books much more. I thought this book would be stories about teaching and his individual students' struggles to learn, his relationships with them, etc. Instead, it seemed to be just a platform to tell more stories of his life, in that he would tell his life stories to his students, because the students wanted to hear stories rather than the subject he was teaching.It wasn't really what I was expecting and I believe he used most of his best stories of his childhood and youth in the first two books."
3,McCourt's Third Best Memoir,"Teacher Man is an entertaining, very readable book, but it doesn't have the depth or emotion that made Angela's Ashes and 'Tis so memorable. This story is not only about McCourt's classroom teaching, but also deals with many of the personal issues he faced throughout his professional life, but all the little anecdotes are short and seem relatively insignificant in the grand scheme of his life--it is like the stand-up comic version of the McCourt we knew in his previous books. Teacher Man is still worth reading because it is fun and breezy, but certainly not as good as McCourt's previous works."
3,There can be no comparison,"Having read Angela's Ashes I came across Teacher Man in my local bookstore. What really amazed me was the difference between the two books.Whereas the author in Angela's Ashes just 'grabs you' and takes you on his rollercoaster for a fantastic ride, this was not so in Teacher Man. In Teacher Man it may have been that the author has written more for his readers than for himself. This in my view gave the book a more reflective and distanced feel to it while still being very funny. Having said this, I think I am hooked on the G-forces created by the rollercoaster ride in Angela's Ashes; there can in fact be no comparison."
5,A view from the other side of the teacher's desk,"All of us have had experiences with teachers and school - yet few know what it is like to stand in front of a class of America's youth and DO the thing. Frank McCourt humorously and honestly tells it like it is.In his typical self-depreciating manner, he retells of thirty years in the teaching profession and his attempts at engaging students, making lessons relevant, questioning, probing, prodding, beging and pleading for kids to learn and to love learning.His experiences range from teaching the poor, working class and immigrant kids, to the children of the affluent at one of New York's most prestigeous high schools. The irony is, kids are kids. And good teaching is good teaching: let the students explore, let them work things out; encourage them, listen.As a teacher, I see pieces of myself in many of his stories. I also see my kids in most of his tales. It is heart-warming, frustrating and moving - like teaching itself. Highly recommended."
5,Loved this book!,"Great read especially if you are a teacher or work with high school kids. McCort writes with humor, and is not afraid to show his innocence/naivety."
3,Life and Teaching Are Not Easy,"I was very surprized about this book. Frank McCourt was not the jovial , funny loving man I thought he would be. In this memoir, Mc Court writes briefly about his college education, his early years teaching at vocational high schools, and finally with pride some interesting lessons he taught at Stuyvesant High School.McCourt writes honestly about the difficulty of teaching . There is some humor in his story ( McCourt developed his students' writing skills by having them practice writing excuse notes). McCourt also had some sexual affaires before and during his unhappy marriage.I liked this book. It was honest.I came away from the book thinking that we shouldn't give up on ourselves. No matter how old we are we can still make a differnce. Frank McCourt was 66 years old when he wrote his first book."
3,Teacher Man - Capable Writing but Wanders at Times,"I like McCourt's style of writing - concise, easy, flowing. But in this book there are times when he wanders with his storytelling. I expected him to write more about students and others in his life, less excerpts with his own banter in the classroom, less commentary about every single woman he has ever crossed paths with."
1,Yawn....,"I loved Angela's Ashes, I thought 'Tis was ""just okay"", and although I finished Teacher man in less than two days, at the end it left me with a gnawing sense of wanting more. And it could have been so much more! There were a few, brief moments of inspiration, of brilliance, but far too much ho-hum boredom."
2,"Disappointing, offensive","There may be worth in this book if you can stomach the frequent and obnoxious sexual references. Does the reader really need to know Mr. McCourt couldn't keep his eyes off the breasts of his female students? I agree with the reviewer who said that the author is simply riding the success wave of Angela's Ashes. I thoroughly enjoyed that first book, but this one was nauseatingly perverted."
2,Repetitive and dull,"I have never read any of McCourt's work before, but my mother-in-law told me that as an English teacher, I had to read this one. It reads quickly, but I was appalled more than once at McCourt's lack of interest in teaching and his seeming pride in being a mediocre teacher. Mr. McCourt, there is a happy medium between telling stories about your life to students and being one of the hardline teachers. To get respect you have to earn it and it is especially hard to earn the respect of 18 year olds. Very sad indeed......"
2,Struggled to finish,"He may be a good writer, but after reading this not only do I think he was a bad teacher, but a jerk too. Skip this one."
3,Just OK,"After having read Angela's Ashes and Tis, I was disappointed with Teacher Man. Having taught school myself for a few years,I was expecting a little more meat in the book. Teaching is one of the hardest jobs in the world and I am a little bewildered by the complete confusion Mr McCourt seemed to show in the classroom. On the other hand, perhaps it worked for him and his class. There is still a sadness in the unhappiness in his life, like he has been wandering aimlessly. As someone else noted, I got a little tired of the negativity and whining. This book is far from the quality of Angela's Ashes which is one of the best I've read."
3,Great author,"This book is not as good as the first two books this author wrote ""Angela's Ashes"" and ""Tis"". It is a good read."
4,Teacher Man: A Memoir,I have not yet begun reading this book. I will be reading it for my book club. It sounds interesting and I am looking forward to getting into it soon.
4,Teacher Man,"I was a teacher, counselor, administrator in public schools in CA. The book is interesting, goes at a fast clip but it suffers from some ""Oh poor me"" attitudes that I have seen during the many years I was in public schools. McCourt too often mentions his 5 classes and 175 students a day...Again and again.After I got by this, I was interested in many interesting stories about his students and their parents. He is a good story teller.The book will be enjoyed by any teacher. It is honest, and one is left with the impression that McCourt tried to be a good teacher but never quite made it. I arrived at this opinion possibly because the author has the habit of emphasising the negative. He may have been better than he portrayed himself."
2,Misleading title,I bought this book because of the title - I am a teacher and I love reading about other teachers. It was very disappointing because the book was more about childhood memories than teaching. He just used the classroom as an excuse to write his memoirs. It is more of a biography. I wanted to learn more about his teaching and less about shipyards and Irish childhoods. I quickly read it and sold it.
1,pointless,"I was very disappointed in this book. I loved ""Angela's Ashes"" and liked ""'Tis"" and expected to enjoy this book too, but it was flat and lifeless. McCourt doesn't seem to have much insight into himself or his students. He just says over and over how tough they are and how they don't put up with any BS from teachers.The anecdotes about specific students all started to sound the same after the first few. In fact, they sounded like he just made them up for the sake of illustrating a point (which was invariably that kids are tough and they don't take any BS from teachers).This book was tiresome and tedious. I wish I could have my $21 and my X number of hours spent reading it back."
2,Teacher Man fails to deliver,"He has a wonderful writing style which I admire, however I didn't like this particular book. He wrote very little about his students, and very little about his teaching life. Most of it was about his sad childhood and his extramarital affairs.I had been hoping to read more about his experiences teaching and his thoughts about teaching.No Child Left Behind? The True Story of a Teacher's Quest"
5,I still don't give five-star reviews,"Another author who really doesn't need my reviews. You see his name, you're blown away with awe, and you buy his book. Right? Right. This is the guy who first published at age 66 and won hisself a Pulitzer. This go-round, over 30 years of teaching in New York City fuel his creative fire. I read it almost non-stop and kept bugging Jan by reading passages aloud and such. I couldn't stop myself, damn you Mr McCourt. Get this book and you'll love it. You know you will. You remember ANGELA'S ASHES and 'TIS, so you know this book's hilarious yet serious. I'll definitely be reading it again. Sometimes hardcover is welcome."
4,Teacher's guide to creativity,What a delightful offering of praise to our hard-working teachers in the public school system. I laughed at the testing of the students that provoked Frank McCourt to be creative in his teaching techniques. I cried over the struggles he allowed us into his brain to experience. The teachers I remember best were those who thought outside the system and inspired us with imaginative projects. This book documents the daily struggles of a teacher trying to meet the immense needs of students he or she cares about deeply. As an educator it spurs me on to find ways to teach my students. Inspiring.
2,"As a former teacher, I DON'T recommend this book","I was extremely surprised to see that this book has currently 4 stars as I was very disappointed in this book. As many other reviewers stated, this book doesn't compare to the amazing Angela's Ashes. I wasn't expecting Teacher Man to live up to its predecessor, however, I thought I'd at least be inspired, as the topic of teaching means a lot to me. At some points, I did like the way Mr. McCourt recalled the happenings in his classroom, but these points were few and far between. Furthermore, I became annoyed at his numerous accounts of sexual conquests. If they had shaped his teaching career, I would understand the inclusion. But I did not see how they related, whereas his divorce and the birth of his daughter are rarely mentioned. A big disappointment from someone I still consider as a great author."
5,Color me a McCort fan for life . . .,"I'm married to an English teacher, so I had a built-in bias for this book. I am also a fan of ANGELA'S ASHES.McCort delights in this telling of a terrified man trying to manage a group of inner city students in a class they (1) didn't want to take and (2) didn't think they needed.McCourt was all the things a good teacher should be. He was resourceful, funny, daring and creative. Good for him and good for those kids who fell under his magic spell.Even if you've never heard of McCourt's other work, this is a book to savor. He's that good."
3,A Pleasant Read...3 1/2 Stars,"It's hard not to root for the loveable Frank McCourt. While Teacher Man is by no means on the same level of earth-shattering greatness as Angela's Ashes, it's still a fun, entertaining and poignant reminder of McCourt's gift of gab. He describes the post-Angela's Ashes Frank McCourt as the ""Mick of the moment"". Perhaps he is being brutally honest with us to a fault. Even though Teacher Man has a few wonderfully entertaining moments, it appears as if his star is fading just a bit. Borrow this book from the library and enjoy it on a flight across the country, then return it..."
2,It's not Angela's Ashes,"Compared to Angela's Ashes and 'Tis, Teacher Man was disappointing. Much of McCort's anctidotes seemed to be repeats of 'Tis. McCort is a woderful author, but it will be difficult to top Angela's Ashes."
3,"Entertaining but not a ""Must Read""","As a teacher to former teenagers, I could relate with a lot of what Frank tells about. It was very humerous at times. However, he whined a lot more than I had hoped he would in this book. I could not feel sorry for him when he complained.I enjoyed the fact that he himself reads the story. That's what kept me hooked till the end. It was a nice tale of his life. I did not find it, however, to be a ""must read"" for educators and anyone else interested in public education in America. Most people already know about the problems we face and have faced for decades. No solutions are offered."
5,A must read for teachers or soon to be teachers,What a great guide afor the soul that is within the classroom. This novel is filled with very funny and poignent stories of a man/teacher and his many journeys while becoming and being a teacher in the classroom. McCourt's humorous tales of what and how the opposition (students) acts and treats teachers and each other. Very worth the time to read it. You will have much trouble putting it down!!!
4,A master of teaching reveals his source of joy,"I dearly enjoyed Angela's Ashes, but found the sequel 'Tis to not be worth finishing. This book completes the trilogy, and 'tis much better than the last installment, although not as mesmerizing as Angela's Ashes. The reason it's so much better than 'Tis can be explained by the fact that McCourt came into his own as a teacher, and he clearly loved his job. One of his great strengths as a teacher traces to his vivid recollections of his own childhood, his willingness to disclose that childhood to his students, and his power to alchemize the tedium and oppression inflicted upon kids into a great story. His pedagogy was very playful, encouraging students to set cookbook recipes to music, write excuse notes for historical villains, and throw their hearts into their craft. (Note: the 9th CD actually contains excerpts from McCourt's two previous books. I suppose this is in place of the typical ""Author interview"" which pads the final disc in audiobooks)."
5,Great read!,"This ""teacher memoir"" is a funny, compelling read. I'm a teacher, and tend to enjoy classroom memoirs. This one had heart and humor, and stands above most. It's a real page-turner that I recommend to teachers and non-teachers alike."
5,One-of-a-kind performance,"It has been noted that everything Dame Janet Baker recorded is well worth hearing, and perhaps that is most true when she worked with Sir John Barbirolli. They did not record many works together (these, Elgar's ""Sea Pictures"" and ""Dream,"" and Berlioz's ""Les Nuits d'Eté"" about cover it), but every one holds a special place in the discography.Mahler's song cycles may have been written for a man's voice (such as Thomas Hampson or Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau). However, listening to these performances, you'd never miss the difference. Baker and Barbirolli capture the atmosphere of each song perfectly, with especially lovely performances of the Rückert Lieder--the ending of ""Um Mitternacht"" is awe-inspiring. Then the Kindertotenlieder come along, and the raw emotion in both orchestra and voice alternately shock and soothe the listener.Anyone who wants an introduction to Mahler's song cycles need not hesitate over this disc."
3,Not for Me!,"My hair is frizzy/curly/wavy and kind of unruly, and my only requirement for a product is to soften and tame. I like the way this makes my hair feel and it styles great, but my skin hates this product. I tend to be oily and by mid-afternoon, every time I use this stuff, my head itches and my scalp and neck break out in zits. I scratch my head so much that any hair style I had has turned into a bird's nest and I look like a feral child. If you don't have sensitive skin, by all means try it. I keep going back to it because I don't like the idea of tossing a half-full bottle, then I try it again and regret it. When I get home tonight it's going in the trash."
2,"2 1/2 Stars So-so gel, with cons!","I got this gel sometime ago and got around to using it for a wash-n-go. Just going to tell you all some pros/cons before buying it.PROS-Has a topical smell, so if you like that for you hair you'll def. enjoy it-Gives a lighter hold, soft actually-Dries clear-Not much shrinkage-Easy to rinse after usage-Defines the curl without it feeling crusty/hardCONS-After wearing my defined curls for a day and sleeping it the curls were less than defined-Gave my scalp an itchy feeling I did not appreciate-While applying it I noticed a sudsy appearance (I have dark hair, so if your hair is light you may notice it)-PARABEN ALERT!-Didn't lay down my edges had whip out my Eco Styler-6oz for $5 bucks where I can get a tub of Eco 32oz for this priceEnd result my hair had so-so results. It would probably be a good gel if you low on other styling products or wearing a style for a day/night out or til you get around to doing you hair."
5,"Excellent band, Oustanding album.","This is a very impressive album. I first heard of Dragon Force from Guitar Hero III; If you like their song ""Through the Fire and Flames,"" then you will almost definately enjoy this album. Inhuman Rampage almost immediately became a favorite among my music collection. I addition, I have found that this is one of the few albums, which I have owned, that does not grow old after listening to it many times. Recommended to anyone who enjoys fast paced metal or progressive rock."
4,very cool,"i am a huge power metal fan. blind guardian, iced earth, savage circus, rhapsody... this band has great melodies, and amazing stamina at those speeds.but one complaint i have is it seems like every song is in the same key. every chorus is the same. they are a bit bland. but it's their speed that makes you not really care.o .. and to clear up one thing the people who are saying it's 250 bpm and up are way off .. it's only a bit over 200. the song wolf by iced earth has double bass at about the same speed. people should really learn what bpm is and how to calculate it instead of saying that someone is playing 500bpm when they are really only playing 170. but .. sorry for the ramble. this is a great band. and if this band brings power/speed metal to a more mainstream spot that would be great.. because then it would give me a better chance of making it with my band. lol"
3,I O.D.'ed on cheese and I'm not even lactose intolerant!,"These guys have talent. They can play their instruments (obviously) and the vocalist can belt out some pretty high notes. The guitarists are the epitome of shredders! They practially slice up the airwaves with their hyper-shredding dual solos! Extremely fast and crazy stuff. It's definitely worth watching/checking it out.Why 3 stars then? Simply put: THEY'RE TOO CHEESEY AND ANNOYING! These guys definitely aren't a serious band. The guitarists flat out stated that they tried to make their guitars sound like video games. In fact, in one of their music videos they even played a video game while cutting back and forth to their dual solos!I don't mind some light-heartedness and fun with power metal, but power metal's cheesey enough to begin with, but these guys just take it to a whole new level!The songwriting sucks but I give them credit for their technical abilities."
2,eh....no,"this is by far Dragonforce's worst album. It's just beating around the bush; it just showed that Dragonforce used their sound far too much at this point, and it got old and boring. It's definitely not as good as the 2 albums preceding, and NOWHERE near as amazing as Ultra Beatdown. The songs here are commercial, polished, and boring. Anyone who can listen to this album front to back and not get bored, must be on something.There are two worthwhile tracks (Operation Ground and Pound, Trail of Broken Hearts), but even those two are letdowns compared to their other 3 albums (especially Ultra Beatdown).so, this album is all too skipable. I recommend getting Ultra Beatdown (by far Dragonforce's finest hour), Valley of the Dead, and Sonic Firestorm, and downloading this if you really want it."
3,"Yes, they have chops.","Yes, we all know Dragonforce can play fast, but what else can they do?Well, pretty much nothing else. They are all great players, but they just don't have much variety. If you're a fan of Dragonforce, no doubt you will be awe-stricken by Inhuman Rampage, but if you're more like me, and enjoy variety in an album, then it will leave you dissapointed. All the songs stand alone, there's no cohesiveness to the album, and at first listen they all sound the same. I've heard many people call Dream Theater(btw, my favorite band) masturbatory, but they are not when compared to a band such as Dragonforce.However, this album is not all bad. It's good music to listen to in the morning, it seems to get me energized. It's probably also good exercising music.Highly reccomended if you enjoy REALLY fast metal, don't care about lyrics, and excessively long solos. But for others, look elsewhere. Maybe Kamelot?"
4,Delightful,"A buddy of mine let me borrow his copy of this cd because I (direct quote) ""have not lived until you've heard this band! It's like video game music on epinephrine!"" All of my suspicions were confirmed. This is by far the most over-the-top album these ears have ever heard. This album is uncompromisingly fast, beautiful, and brutal at times. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because I can't give it 4 1/2 and don't quite feel like rounding up. A great way to enjoy them is to roll down your car windows and drive around a crowded public area blasting it as loud as you can (particularly parts with the amazing vocals). It is a ton of fun, and is sure to get weird looks from people. Great times."
3,Hold the hair conditioner,"Ok lets make this simple. Good drum work, good guitar,.. no wait.. Great guitar! All you metal heads out there know what bands move you most right? Arent we listening to Lamb of God, Mastadon, Shadows fall, Inflames..? Our roots coming from (Young)Metallica, Dio, Megadeth, Iron Maiden whatever. There's a reason we've left the 80's ""Hair metal"" >dokken< >whitesnake< >defLep<. Dragonforce.. haha i mean does a good front man mean something to you at all?? Take the voice tone way D o w n. Ill take these guy's as a good joke. the guitarist's should look into making a more ""Of the now"" band. I'd buy."
4,pretty darn good,"There is no doubt that these guys are tremendously talented. However, lyrically they are weak. I mean how many times can you hear about flying off to some far off land to fight the evil one and not get a little sick of the similarity in song themes. Their saving grace are their impromptu fills that are fun and goofy. I love the Helloween upbeat aspect, the Yngwie Malmsteen arpeggios, and do appreciate the fantasy overtones. I hope they evolve lyrically, it will definetly help their chances of being a premier (and lasting) metal act."
2,Too much hype.,"Many magazines were giving this cd too much hype. This is a talented band but they play that ""Walt Disney Helloween Metal."" The first few lines from ""Through the Fire and Flames""-""On a cold winter...around the world tonight""- is the same melody as ""The Hotel California""-""On a dark desert...for the night""- by the Eagles. If you want to hear some better Power Metal bands from 2006 then try Beyond Fear with Ripper Owens or Killing Machine with James Rivera. Those bands don't play ""Walt Disney Metal."" Or try ""Threshold"" by Hammerfall or ""The Black Flame"" by Wolf. As I stated, Dragonforce was over hyped."
2,Sure these guys can shred and play fast...............but what else can they do ?,"NOT A LOT ELSE TO BE HONEST. So many people have been fooled in to believing this band is amazing simply because of the speed that they play at, but to be honest is speed really everything? All the songs on the CD lack creativity and sounds pretty much the same as the last song . Every fu**ing track on this album is plagued with fast drum beats, some crappy power metal riff that remains throughout the song and lightning fast guitar solos which is impressive when you've heard one but by the end of the CD its a drag. Don't get me wrong, to be able to play this takes a hell of a lot of skill and ability, but they need to use that skill and ability to come up with something a lot more creative and inventive."
3,Ok Metal band,"Yes they are fast. But being fast does not make you a great band. Yes Herman Li is a fast guitar player. But that does not make him a great guitar player.Ok now that, that is out of the way here is what I have to say. It is good but not great. This is the only CD I have by them and it's different for power metal. But once you hear a lot of the other power metal bands out there such as Sonata Arctica, Kamelot, Nightwish, Hammerfall, Iced Earth, Blind Guardian, Edenbridge, Symphony X, Sinergy, Lunatica, Visions of Atlantis, etc you will find that they are not the best of the best Becuase much of what they do has been done and is being done by a lot of other power metal bands.I'm not saying you should not checking them out. I'm just saying that they are not the best Power Metal band out there. In my view Kamelot is far better then them. But that's just me and to each there own."
5,"Oh Dear, 5 more stars!","This is the fastest Dragonforce album yet, proving that they are indeed an ever changing band. Instead of trying to find what all the fans found great about the earlier works, they intuitively knew that if they play harder and faster, the fans would react positively. And positively they did. So far nobody I talked to has had any problems with this album (well except for those techno interlude things, but some of my friends actually liked those). Overall, this album is a fan pleaser, because it is catchy fast, non formulaic, solo-laden and overall, well, almost perfect."
1,Too repetitive....,I hate this album all songs are too repetitive. I also don't like the fast guitars.
1,Sounds like ....,I bought this cd expecting some good metal but really it sounds like someone took their sound and put it in a blender and spewed it back out at the speed of a Slayer album on 78. Too repetitive and boring. Fast guitars and drums just banging away but for what? To sound fast. Most of all this album is BORING!
4,pretty good,This albulm is pretty good The instruments are not what earned this albulm a four star review the singer kindof sounds like a girl and the songs have some cheesy names and lyrics but if you can get past that the singer does sound good just like a little boy/woman. Any way I like how they keep the whole song fast and this is true speed metal not even coming close to being as good as anthrax but it is still good. So if you like Anthrax then you might wanna check this out it is not as good as Anthrax but it is pretty good.
4,awesome,"All of the songs are at least 7 minutes long. If you like your music like that, with wicked guitar licks in the middle, you will love this."
4,WTF?!?!?!,"I don't know if I should fall down laughing or bow down in awe. I've always complained people don't know how to play their instruments anymore. Well...here ya go! These guys bring it WAY over the top. Almost too much? Is that possible? The song titles, artwork, lyrics, hell even the band name are just flat out ridiculous but the musicianship absolutely throttles the listener. The average listener won't ""get"" this album but musicians, producers and people in a music related field will be studying this benchmark for a LONG time to come."
3,"Fun and fast, but not real.","I own this CD, and it is much, much fun to listen to. I am a big fan of power metal (Sonata Arctica, Majestic Vanguard, Narnia, Divinefire ect.), and I enjoy this CD very much! It is super repetative and over the top, but it is fun. I just want to let everyone know that think that they are super-musicians that they are not...they speed up their songs in the studio, so what you hear is not actually them, but them sped up. Thats part of the reason they have the whole video game sound. This CD, for the person with a sense of humor that just wants some power metal fun, is definitly worth getting, but not worth getting freaky over. Thanks!"
5,AWESOME!!,I love this album & this band. I'm a guitarist for over 20 years and have always loved shred music. THis album is so fast and furious it blew me away. The skill these guys have is amazing. I bought their other albums based on this one and have been a happy shred-head ever since! This album is not for those who are looking for pop.
1,Remember When Helloween Did This 20 Years Ago?,I don't understand the hype surrounding Dragonforce. They have the EXACT same sound as Helloween and almost the EXACT same lyrical content. The only difference is the guitarists in Helloween didn't need flashy pedal effects to make it sound like they were accomplished guitarists. I ended up buying Inhuman Rampage out of curiosity above all else and was incredibly disgusted and turned off for reasons I stated previously.
2,Metal Chipmunks?,"Extremely fast instrumetation ...IF they are really playing at this speed. There are several artifacts of the recording that make it sound like it has been recorded at a slower speed and sped up: (1) the extreme clarity of each passage across all instrument is not likely (all players would have to play flawlessly at this fast speed), (2) the vibrato in the vocals sounds too fast, and (3) the key of the songs sounds higher and less dark than you would expect from a typical Metal song. It sounds like a Metallica LP played at 45rpm.If they are actually playing this fast, kudos. However, speed isn't everything. The songs just aren't that interesting."
3,Okay They Can Play Fast,"Look they are very talented, the singing is nice and relaxing, but come on how long can you stand listening to a band play as fast as they can? I'll will admit I like this album more than the sonic firestorm, the guitar solos are a little more creative. Now on to the instrument that I hate the most. Keyboards! How can you rock with keyboards? I hate the little things with a passion. All in all, not a bad album, but personely I think it is one you can do without. Try something from Shadows Fall, The Autumn Offering, or even Children of Bodom is you are really into keyboards."
2,Why?,"I read all the reviews for this cd and the way it was hyped I was interested in listening to the group, no, I felt it was my duty as a musician and rock fan. I popped it in and man I was amazed, I was like, ""Shyeah, these guys play fast, but lets see what the rest of the cd is like."" To my horror, every track sounds EXACTLY the same, like a trash can full of marbles rolling down stairs at full blast on fire. These guys know how to rock, and are talented, however, there is no variety, every time they break into a different sort of riff and start to do something different they quickly switch back to the same familiar groove. Overall the cd sucks musically, technically its amazing, but you won't remember any of it once you turn it off."
5,"It may be cheesy, but I love it!","I do, I love it. I find myself trying to figure out what video game they got a particular melody from and I'm like, ""what is that, Mega Man 3?"" But, the cheesy part is not the main thing I like about it. It is the over-all vibe that this music carries. The insane speed and terrific melody of it all coupled with the beautifully vague fantasy of the lyrics gives me bouts of joy at times. When I'm in the mood for it, it is the best. I like many different kinds of music and when I'm in the mood for extreme power metal, nothing beats DragonForce."
5,Musical quality,"Since I heard the promo song ""Through the Fire and Flames"", it blew my mind, so did this album.These guys won't stop playing fast, Herman Li does a tremendous work along with Sam Totman and Dave on drums. ZP, he's not a bad singer, but his style just keep repeating... and the lyrics, they are way to similar from their beginning.Nevertheless, awesome songs and skills fill this album up. Revolution Deathsquad, Storming the Burning Fields and Cry For Eternity are my personal favorites.If you like DragonForce music, then go and get this, if you like Power Metal or Speed Metal, go for it too. Great job from this UK Band, starting well this 2006."
3,DragonForce are past their prime,"Valley of the Damned was a good album. Sonic Firestorm was not good. This is not as bad as Sonic Firestorm but seriously shouldn't hit the level of Valley of the Damned. They shouldn't have became famous for this. There is 1 track I like, and that's Cry for Eternity. It does lots,and doesn't sound bland (the other 7 tracks are bland, and don't go anywhere).Just download Cry for Eternity and begone."
5,We love this book,"My 2 1/2 year old enjoys reading this book, as do my husband and I. The pictures are full of detail, and each page allows for more than one discussion about the preposition word printed on the page. As the saying goes, ""a picture is worth a thousand words"" - we have a great time discussing each picture and talking about what is happening."
3,Not very impressive with its superficial content,"This book is -a bit extended- hardcopy version of Unixware 7 online help. There is no in-depth knowledge. If you want to do disaster recovery or system tuning, you'll find nothing in this book. In this book, you may learn to add ppp interface, another ethernet card or disk and some other simple system management tasks which rarely works as it is said in the pages."
2,Great for about 6 months..,"I purchased this mouse about 6 months ago when they were on sale at the local electronics store. Everything went fine, installed without a hitch and even came with a USBtoPS2 adapater which works fine. I really like the extra button on each side of the mouse. This is very handy for navigating forwards and backwards through web pages, or you can set it to copy and paste or any other key combination through the software provided by Microsoft.However, earlier tonight those 2 buttons I count on for so much stopped working. I rebooted, reinstalled the mouse drivers, did the usual routine. Still no dice.Why not 1 star? I called up Microsoft and they're going to send me a replacement if I fax over a copy of the bottom of the mouse. So at least they're taking care of a customer. So I love this mouse, but it has failed me in my hour of need ;) Hopefully I just got a mouse from a bad batch, since I wasn't able to find many people online with this same problem."
2,Disappointing,"I've used several of the MS Optical Intellimouse for years so when my old one finally became gunked up beyond reason I didn't hesitate to replace it with a new one. Unfortunately, the newly minted versions have a different scroll wheel design. Instead of operating smoothly with just a slight ""bumpy"" feel for each increment, the scroll wheel now feels loose and it rattles in operation. I thought I'd received a defective unit and exchanged it -- but the exchange Intellimouse was just the same. It works fine, but it's unpleasant and annoying to use. I'll probably replace it with a Logitech mouse before too much longer."
5,great mouse for left-handed use,"This is the best mouse available for left-handed use.The mouse is truly symmetrical, it has 5 buttons and works on PC or Mac.Microsoft has good, decent drivers for the Mac and the PC.On the mac, my configuration is:left button - secondary clickright button - clickmiddle button - command + click (great for selecting multiple items on a list)left side button - type F11 (expose)right side button - type F9 (show desktop)this works great for me.note: to configure ""type f11"" to work in the mouse control panel, I select ""keystroke"", then type control-f11, then uncheck the control checkbox.This lets you use expose with the mouse."
3,mouse,"this mouse is ok but i have bought another one a year agoand it is alot better and there the same mouse. the one i just bought is loose and every time you use it or touch it you can here it,so they are making them cheaper.So the next mouse i buy will not be this one."
5,Please with intellimouse,"I have found the MS Intellimouse Optical to be a reliable and responsive device. I have found the extra buttons to be useful when performing data entry. With a touch I can repeat the previous record and then I need only edit the differences. This saves a lot of key strokes when entering relatively repetitive records. The same buttons are useful for browsing back and forth through web pages, rather than using the Back button on the browser page."
5,Best Mouse ever,I had my first mouse like this for 4 years and would still be using it if the vac had not wrecked the cord when it got sucked into it.Love the side buttons and the wheel. Looked all over and could not fint this mouse in the stores any more so I am glad they still sell it. I tried the Microsoft wireless mouse and do not like it because it is heavy and the shore range between it and the receiver.You will like this mouse.
5,Works as expected,"This is my 3rd Intellimouse Optical. I will be using this on my notebook, because the smaller notebook mouses seem to be giving me carpal tunnel.It's a 5 year old design, but I love this mouse, i have it on two of my desktops."
3,GREAT when it works!,"I LOVED this mouse at first. It's a big improvement over my old mouse that had a ball. Recently, the side buttons started to lose their programming. I didn't even change it; I kept the default settings. Sometimes I find myself opening my mouse software every few minutes to click the OK button, just to make the side buttons work. I wish I had bought the cheaper one, but I don't feel like going through the hassle of returning this mouse and hooking up another one.I'm adding to this. I gave away that mouse 2 two years ago, when I bought a new computer. An optical mouse came with the computer. I do NOT miss the extra buttons."
2,Not as great as I expected it to be.,"Many of the reviews here praise the ergonomics and 'feel' of the mouse. Personally I find it awkward to handle. The mouse itself is very light and easy to move around though. However, due to its lightness, the stiff and heavy cord actually drags the mouse away sometimes. The buttons are extremely light as well. If you even look at them funny, they click. And since they placed button #5 on the right side of the mouse, instead of on the left side next to button #4 where it should be, I'm constantly clicking it when moving the mouse. I had to disable the button with the software to avoid unwanted commands. For the money I paid for it, I'm not happy."
2,unsatisfied,"The mouse is too large for my hand so I cannot use all the features built into it. It has been less than two months since I purchased this item and the scrolling feature is not working well ... if at all. When I try to ""scroll down"" in my email accounts and my websites, the scroll bar moves down in small ""jerks"", and the wheel is not much better. Further when I switch users, I must unconnect the USB cable and then reconnect for the mouse to work at all. I am a very frustrated and unhappy ""camper"" with a problem that I am unsure of what to do. I cannot be efficiently productive with a ""misbehaving"" mouse. Someone have a suggestion? I do not want to be replacing my mouse everytime I turn around. This is the third one in a year's time."
2,Makes my hand tingle...,"The extra buttons for paging back and forth are a nice touch, but the mouse itself is somewhat bulky and large, and after a few hours of use, my wrist starts to seize up (no one-handed typing jokes, please). I've had to scale down to a Logitech Optical Mouse instead."
4,Smooth and easy to use,"This is the first optical mouse I've used and I really like it. It is smooth, the arrow glides exactly to where you want it. I like the roller in the center that you can scroll the screen without using the scroll bar on the monitor. There's no need for a mousepad and no mouse ball to remove and clean out. Very low maintenance! The only thing I'd do to make this a better mouse is make it cordless!"
1,Microsoft IntelliMouse Optical,"I bought this mouse a few weeks ago. Within a few days, the mouse was acting up: clicking randomly, periodically ceasing to function, and scrolling without my input. I called and complained to Microsoft, whose tech support insisted I must have ""misused"" the mouse and caused it to break. They refused to replace the mouse or even allow me to ship it back for repairs. Now, the mouse is getting very bad. It will close browser windows and attempt to scroll about once every two to three minutes. I recently trashed the Optical in favor of a comperable Logitech infrared mouse, which I have had no problems with, and like very much."
2,Problem with touching some time it doesn't work.,"Problem with touching,some time it doesn't work.I have to do it twice!What you paid what you got."
2,Scroll wheel too easy to click,"Overall, the mouse feels great and tracks just fine. The ONLY problem is with the scroll wheel. I prefer to configure the scroll wheel button as a double click, and I find that whenever I scroll up, I almost always wind up clicking the button. It's just too sensitive for my tastes."
4,Average...,...but better than the wireless pos I had before. This mouse is almost perfect but I hate the individual clicks when scrolling.
4,Jerry - The Intelli Mouse,Good stuff but just one drawback makes it a bit uncomfortable i.e the scrolling wheel that makes a hell lot of noice and is not that smooth ....But the best thing i liked about is it fits in Palm which leaves less stresson to the arm which definitely is a must for all long time computer users....Happy mousing
5,The best mouse.,"I have been using one for years. They work great, are simple in their design, and the side buttons make the internet a breeze! I could not recommend this mouse enough.So much so, that I'm buying one for my father in celebration of him getting a new PC."
2,"Mouse works great ... EXCEPT FOR THE MIDDLE ""wheel"" button.","I was really happy with the mouse for all of 10 minutes.The scroll wheel is really ""push happy"" such that when I roll the wheel, the middle button registers a ""click"" very often. In order to prevent the inadvertant click, I have to roll the wheel with the lightest of light touches. It's significantly more senstive than my older logitech wheel, and was really really annoying to have the browser repeatedly register the middle button (which is unix is the default ""paste"" so I'd have pages and pages of text that I ""selected"" be pasted on to the browser or editor while what I really wanted was just to scroll the buffer!!!Too bad, the mouse was really high quality overall."
5,Great Mouse,"I absolutely love this mouse. I do a lot of web searching and ebaying and the ""back"" button makes life so much easier. Some people seem to mind the red light associated w/ this mouse, but it doesn't bother me at all. It moves easily on all types of surfaces and there's no mouse ball to have to clean on a regular basis. My recommendation is to buy and enjoy!"
3,Disappointing,"I bought this for the 5 button facility but mainly as my Logitech cord free mouse was playing up at 5ft from my computer. I wanted it 5ft away to cut down on radiation effects, and I do notice the difference.However, with this mouse you need to move it 5 inches as opposed to the 2 inches of the Logitech. What this means in practice is you have to move your arm with the Intellimouse, as opposed to just your hand with the cordless Logitech. Quite noticable if you have got used to just moving your hand.I now have two mouses in operation! I use the Intellimouse for when the Logitech is playing up."
1,Could not install,This mouse does not work on my computer. I have Vista Home Premium OS & that may be why it will not install. I installed the software successfully & plugged the mouse into the USB port but get no response - no cursor - from the mouse. If anyone has any suggestions on how to get the mouse to work I would appreciate it.
1,This thing is out of control!,"I think I went nuts when I tried for a few days (maybe hours) to replace my broken mouse with one of these.Every time the table or desk would move the slightest bit, it would either click on something, open a new application, or start to drag a selection on the screen. NOT my cup of tea!Unless your desk is carved from a stone alcove and will never move (say, if a book is dropped on it, or someone bumps into the desk - heck, for me even *typing* was enough vibration for it to go click on things) ---- I would not buy this!!!!"
1,Optical Mouse are the BEST,"If you ever use an optical then you will have to throw away your old ball mouse. Buy it, your hand will thank you for it!"
3,Hard to Install,Install required registry edit to clear out old intellimouse keys. Had to search MS Knowledge Base to get information. Once installed it works perfectly.
3,It wouldn't last...,"I got this mouse a year and a month ago. It has started working erratically when it was about a year old. When I tried to close one tab on my browser it would close the whole browser. It would jump around and just act bad. I've replaced it but I still miss it. Or I miss what it was like when new. But I think a mouse should last more than 13 months. Even the old friction ball mice would last longer, especially one that cost $30. There's no way to take it apart, clean it out and fix it. It was just a waste of money."
5,Good as the one I purchased 8 years ago,"I have been using one for over 8 years.I was glad that I found a place that still had them.Best mouse that I have ever used.Old 8 year old one is still working but, I figured that I had betterget another one while still available."
4,Great mouse for most things...,Awesome for the price... This mouse is good for everything except I can't get the sensitivity high enough for sc2. Just another data point to consider. I have used this mouse and been happy with it (for sc1) for a decade.
5,Best Mouse for the Price,I have had this mouse for a year and have had no problems with it at all. You don't need a mouse pad but you need to use it on a smooth surface. It is extremely accurate and I like that it has 4 buttons it works great for the internet and playing games. It you are good at distroying a regular mouse with a ball this is the mouse for you. It will pay for itself over time. You never have to worry about the mouse sticking at all.
3,good mouse...bad buttons,"This mouse is a great mouse in all, but i had one big problem... the butons. Whenever you click on the mouse it feels as if the button will break down. It hasn't happened to me yet, but it might. It gives you this uncomforatable feeling that you dont want to push down on the button too hard or it will break. To all you computer freaks...if you like optical mouses this one is OK, but if you want a really good mouse then get a Logitech mouse, in my opinion those are the best. But then yet again...this is MY opinion."
3,Returned it,This mouse is very light and the side buttons are very easy to touch by mistake. The buttons are much too sensitive and I had to disable the right one due to constantly touching it by mistake. I finally returned it and found a heavier mouse with side buttons higher up and also cordless.
5,Good Buy,Definately recommend it. Easy to use. Owned one for our main computer but wanted one for the laptop. Good warranty - they replaced our old one without hesitation.
4,Better Than Logitech,"I was disappointed with the performance of the traditional mouse provided by my employer. Replacements failed to improve the problem, and the managerial staff would not approve an optical mouse. I did some research and found this product. It tracks well, performs all the functions of a standard two-button mouse, and the extra two buttons allow me to work even faster than before. I was so impressed with it that I bought a second one for use at home. It's a spectacular product, and I have no complaints."
5,Excellent mouse for gaming and surfing the Internet,"I have this mouse because a good friend of mine recommended it to me. It is great for gaming (Counterstrike) as you can assign functions to the buttons on the side. Also just for internet surfing, the back and forward functions that come default are the best. The mouse itself is very precise and you don't need that sweaty old mouse pad anymore. You can even use the mouse on the palm of your hand! Best mouse out there."
4,Prescient for its time,"Torture, rendition, holding people without access to lawyers, all the things we see now are used in this thriller about a spy stealing secrets from the US and how a shadowy organization uses and abuses anyone it wants to get its way, regardless of who is hurt. This was made in 1971 and there is nothing funny about it. It could be another day in our government here in 2012."
3,Not a bad movie,I liked it . A little rough in spots . I can agree with some of the other reviews to a point . For the low price it is still better entertainment than most of the box office postage stamps they churn out today . It moves right along . George Peppard is excellent as always
2,Some nice and rare oldies terribly remasterd.,"Like its seven predecessors, this CD contains some of the rarest and most obscure soul oldies recorded during the 1960s and early-'70s. The sound quality on most tracks, however, is simply horrible with vinyl surface noise being ever-present. The total lack of relevant liner notes about these artists and songs IS suspect."
1,Terrible!,"I saw Tillie's Punctured Romance, the first full-length silent comedy, on TCM recently and was hoping that this DVD would look as good or better. Especially since it appears to be the only DVD of it available.Forget it!Worse looking than a six-hour VHS, the video was choppy and blurry. I had to stop viewing after five minutes because it was totally unenjoyable.I knew that I was taking a chance on this but since the price was cheap it was still worth the gamble. Unfortunately, I lost."
4,"Good Ring, Great Price","Product looks high quality in person and shines nicely. The size and quality are great and I would recommend the ring for younger women with a sense of fashion since the flower on the ring is larger than average. Overall this is a good product, good price, with fast delivery."
5,Easy to use,"The flasks are pliable but sturdy, the instructions were very helpful and they were easy to transport in our checked luggage for a cruise."
4,Savvy Sailings,"The Rum Runner Flask lives up to its name.Smaller than advertised, but definitely holds 8oz, 16oz of liquids.Easy to pack & use.Clean up has to air-dry, since you want to make sure that nothing remainsin the pouch.Undetectable, cruise on in."
4,Don't leave home with out them,"Great items to have when traveling, especially soap, mouth wash, beverages, easy to use and pack take let's space than a bottles and"
3,i didnt read the info enough,product was SO SMALL. :/ wish it was bigger so i could fit more inside of it. will read into it more next time
4,4 1/2 stars- innovative product,"Why has no-one else thought of this? These things are very cool. I use it as a water bottle as a good alternative to disposable bottles and Nalgene-type bottles (that are huge and tend to leak in my bag).They fit well in my handbag and seem pretty undestructible. Strangers have actually stopped me in public to ask what they are and where I bought them.I think it'd be wise to market them for more than just liquor as most ppl I know carry water and don't want to waste plastic or carry unweildy sport bottles.Caveats:1-Cleaning was a pain- it took several days for the inside to dry (and yes, I followed the instructions) so I'm a bit concerned about germs growing inside.2-There is no plastic recycling rating- so you don't know if there are chemicals in the plastic that could be leaking carcinogenic properties.3-Filling it is definitely more messy/difficult than a regular bottle.Overall, still very cool."
5,Best Bang For Your Buck,This flask kit is cheap and gets the job done. I've already used the three flasks for four different occasions. I've sat on them with liquid inside and put them in the freezer. Once they empty they roll and stow-away. They wash easily and the included funnel is very helpful.
5,Worth every penny!,"I just returned from my first cruise with these wonderful contraptions. The picture makes them look bigger than they really are, but together they hold about a liter of booze. The 2 pint size flasks were small enough to fit in my pocket so I always had something on the go, and I never had one leak the entire trip. These combined with the all you can drink soda card saved way more money than I could ever know."
4,Great idea... instead of using glass,"I haven't had a chance to use them yet... bought them for our upcoming cruise... i've watched many ""youtube"" videos on demonstrations & I think it's a great idea - great to put in your shoes in suitcases. Can't wait - thanks!"
4,"Yeah, these are awesome!","I give it 4 stars only because they are shamelessly overprised for what the cost must be. That said, I had NO problem getting prodigious amounts of liquor on my cruise. Likewise, I can get the 7 ouncers on my CARRY on without security screening them. I've done it 3X just to see if I could do it. These things are great to carry along to events too- I fill one up and throw it in the cooler when going out on the boat. Keeps it compact and glass off the boat. Awesome!"
5,Modern Aircraft,"This is a great book for the lay person who desires more detailed information on aircraft. The book gives brief histories on all types of aircraft, cross sections of each aircraft, plus information on how jet engines function. A history of flight is given as well. A wonderful book for anyone interested in flight!"
1,Wish I could have searched inside.,"Topsy-Turvy BedtimeCute story, until the little girl ends up sleeping with her parents in their bed. Not a behavior I want to encourage."
5,A hilarious acid propeled dive into the mind of a fictional writer,"This movie breaks every convention of traditional story telling, and by doing so, creates something unique; a philosophical dialogue steaped in dark satire that holds your interest to the very end.This movie is also funny as hell (in places litteraly), and still manages to say something profoundly true, (pay attention--it happens so fast that if you blink, you'll miss it!).Be ready for a 'down the rabit hole' trip to the center of the human psyche, and proof that even 'thinking men' can have belly laughfs!"
1,this is not s movie alright!,"Horrible. Confusing. Not even to be considered ""artsy "". The only good parts were Slash's music and a deleted scene. Very disappointed because I love Edward Furlong. It's the biggest waste of time since ""Drive ""."
1,Avoid at all costs,"This movie SUCKS big time!Boring and repetitive as hell, has nice music but that's all.You have been warned."
5,Ralph Emery is a great storyteller!,This book had some great stories that you don't get to hear on CMT or in Country Weekly. I thought this was a well-written account of the history of country music by someone who has been an institution in the industry for over 50 years. Very good book!
1,Great reading if you are having a rough time sleeping,"The title of the book should be 50 Years down a boring road. This story has been told before and there is just no need for a book like this. His first book was great, but please someone tell Ralph that he has the Irish disease of wanting to tell a story twice when it should only be heard once."
3,worth the money,"It made my 3y/o happy, as a replacement car he had lost. That's all I care about. The quality is good, and so far it has lasted and survived my son's treatment."
3,I sent it back...,"I had wanted a mixer box that would pop open, have all the interconnecting cables already attached, and be set to go. This rig can do that. But it is big, it is bulky, and it is not light. I sent it back. And decided to live with the rack that I have, which is not a pop up, but has the same 8 spaces the mini gig rig does. It ain't perfect but it is better, for me at least, than the mini gig rig which was too big/bulky/heavy. I have a joke about being a musician: ""forget the groupies! give me the roadies!"" and as a solo musician I would want a roadie if I were to be using the mini-gig rig. (I think the word ""mini"" may have lured me into believing it was something other than it actually is)."
3,maybe its me?,Hard to get 'into' this I have heard it is good and will have to try again and maybe get into it
2,Not what I expected,"Beyond some very basic ideals (market to mothers based on child's age, not mother's age), this book was disappointing to me. I really wanted some very specific ideas on what to do and this book had more 'here are the types of moms.' Few practical case studies on what has actually worked."
1,Not worth buying this camera.,"I just received it. Camera is good looking but did notcome with case or battery. Importantly, it is not zoomcamera. It is telephoto camera. It means, you get to zoomat predefined levels in this case at 38mm/60mm/75mm/95mm.You can zoom only to either of these 4 settings. I amnow planning to return it."
2,batteries not included,factor in cost of battery before buying this camera since the camera came without battery.
1,Need some new staff writers,"Really, Evans should screen his writers. This episode lacked depth of characters in addition to a mediocre plot. Plot had many possibilities with some imagination. Had the feeling this episode was completed quickly to meet a deadline."
2,disappointed in book as a whole,"for someone that has read the majority of magazine articles about perry ferrell and jane's addiction, watched ""soul kiss"" and ""the gift"" multiple times, owns many rare and live cds, and psi com's ep, i didn't learn anything new about one of the greatest rockers ever. the auther wrote the book in an attempt to be ""tradgically hip"" instead of delving into the life of his subject. though some of the knowledge he has of what bands jane's addiction were up against and/or playing with was interesting, i felt the author got off the track of what was important to the reader: the life of perry ferrell as a person, and an artist. after reading the book i immediatly came to this site to find another biography about perry that i might actually enjoy. no such luck. danny sugarman, are you interested at all?"
3,"Entertaining, but some incorrect information and assumptions","I'm a big Jane's Addiction fan and I've always liked the Perry Farrell image...so I got this book to learn more about his views on lots of subjects. It barely really scratched the surface, and it had some incorrect information (ie. it said Perry's birthname was Simon Bernstein but it is actually Perry Bernstein to begin with). Still you should read it if you are a big fan because it does have some interesting info, but be sure to double-check the knowledge with a 3rd party before you swear about some of this authors' assumptions and information!"
3,"Dealt with facts, and theories, but not the person","This is a cool book to get the progression of Perry Farrell from Jane's Addiction to the beginnings of Porno for Pyros, but it deals with the outside facts of his life, and not his actual life. So, if anything, the book is like a journalistic overview of Perry Farrell as seen through the eyes of the media, but not as seen through the eyes of himself. Much of the book is based in theory and conjecture, so you don't really come to understand who Perry Farrell is, if anything the book's thesis, is that nobody knows who he is. A bit disappointing, but it was cool to learn about the facts surrounding his rise."
5,Vince Flynn has done it again,"For anyone familiar with Vince Flynn's books, it is unnecessary to get into specifics about this book. Suffice it to say that this book makes TV a poor second choice no matter what is on. The only negative thing I can say about Flynn's books is that he can't possibly write them fast enough. I have read everything that he has written, and now I'm suffering withdrawl. I hope he will have another on the market this year. Have no fear, if you like Clancy, or Haig, you will like this, and all of Vince Flynn's books. If you have blood pressure issues though, you may want to be certain that you haven't missed a dose any day you happen to be reading any of Flynn's books!"
4,Separation of Power by Vince Flynn,"It's a Mitch Rapp book. What more can I say? Flynn is one of those writers that by the time you get to page 10, you simply cannot put the book down. I have gradually bought the whole series."
4,Separation of Power,Good read. Gives the reader insight into some of the workings of our political system. The twists and turns that Mr Flynn employs keeps the reader turning pages-can make you lose sleep.
5,New to Flynn and now a big fan,"This was my first Vince Flynn book and I loved it. It is a very fast paced and timely political thriller. The characters are very well developed and and pacing of the book is fast. The political and international plot twists could have been taken out of the newspaper yesterday.I have not read the first books by Flynn yet, and let me emphasize ""yet"", but this book was good enough for me to purchase his first 2, to read more into the main character (Mitch Rapp)and be ready for the next when it comes out in 2003.A Must Read!"
3,"Very good, but I was expecting more","This was my first Vince Flynn novel to read. I enjoyed it, but I was expecting more. This is probably based on Flynn's reputation as a great author, which he is. His novels don't plod as much as Clancy's, but I found I was sucked in to Mitch Rapp's story and international adventures. The political intrigue in D.C. with Irene Kennedy and Sen. Hanks just didn't grab me as much. I'll definitely read him again because I'm very curious to see how Mitch changes as a character."
2,Drags On and On and On,"This book is atypical of Vync's normal writings. I've read 3 of his books before getting to this one and it is almost unbearable. He makes all females useless, and gives them flowery language and overdramatic physical and emotinal features. blah. And when describing any one person's traits or skills it just lags. It's like he is stroking the ego's of his own characters. This book is soooo slow, and the length does not add anythingt o the story. Skip this book and read the others by him, they are good and fun to read or listen to."
4,Mitch Rapp rules,Mitch Rapp is a character who is believable. Although he always takes care of business he's human and displays the flaws which plague all of us. This particular story moved along at less than a breakneck pace until after about half way through. Then the action began and held me until the final chapter. Fans of Vince Flynn should not be disappointed with this book.
5,Great,"Vince Flynn does it again. Great book, gets you into series a little bit more. I recommend it to anyone who likes polisci/spy novels."
3,mitch rapp series,"Reading these Mitch Rapp books in order and have to say the beginning of this one was a little slow to develop but it finished well. Which is better than many novels of this type that are just the opposite. The 2 previous Rapp books, ""the third option"" and ""transfer of power"" were a little more even start to finish. Hopefully ""executive power"" returns Vince Flynn to form."
2,A lot to much of the non essentials,"While I thought the overall story line was good and I did mostly enjoy the book, there were a number of things that I could have done without that I'm sure were simply added to pad the word count.1. The rifle hanging above Senator Clark's fire place must have been discussed or mentioned at least 10 times.2. The discussion of the relationship was way to extensive for this type of book.3. Why in the world would you constantly mention what people were wearing, who cares. In the case where Rapp goes to the White House in dirty jeans and un-shaved, ok that does add to the story line, but as to what people wear and what color it is, no, no, way to much.Again, good story, just way,way,way to much padding. (hint, padded sentence)"
4,Great Book!,"I have read each of Vince Flynn's books and each time he seems to improve. There are surprisingly few problems with this book. For one, Flynn fails to maintain a good tempo in the beginning chapters of this book. Most of the first 200 pages seem too slow in their setup.Flynn completely redeems any of this book's shortcomings with an awesome finale that rivals anything his literary peers have put out recently. This book is good because it is fun and modern and I look forward to seeing more from this author."
4,"Slow start, but still a great book in the series","This is the 4th book in Flynn's series. If you can, you'll really want to read them in order. This one took quite a while to get going. The first 80 pages were little else but recapping the prior three books. I think some recap is fine, but this was way too much. From there, I thought it still had trouble getting traction. Finally, about the last 1/3 of the book took off and kept me page turning.I love the serial aspect of these novels, they flow nicely from one book to the next. I also like Flynn's mixture of actual history with his fictional world.So, far of the 4 books, the 1st and 2nd have been the best for action, the 3rd and 4th were much more focused on Washington DC rather than ""front line"" action.Appropriateness: This book contains a fair amount of language... a word or two every 10 pages. There are characters that are hurt and killed, but none are described graphically. Sexual situations are eluded to, but are not in this book."
3,A subpar book for Vince Flynn,"1. Vince Flynn suffers from the fact that since most of his books are consistently good, one then expects that all of his books will be excellent.2. This book is one of the subpar Vince Flynn books; ie it's still ""ok"", but not great. The main problem I have with this book is the 2-3 different story lines, which in the end, never merge with each other. Perhaps it's a stylistic thing, but it's not my cup of tea. I just find that kind of writing, distracting and at worst, it seems as if the author is just trying to create more pages without adding anything to the core story."
5,seperation of power,"This is Vinces' 4th book. I have to force myself not to race through his books and this one was no different. He sets a pace that you can see coming together to a conclusion, but takes enough twists and turns to keep you guessing how he's going to get there. Mitch Rapp - first introduced in Transfer of power - is a great character and the kind of man you hope is operating, out there, for the USA right now. Vince also has a keen insight to the operations of the CIA, FBI, Secret Service, Politicians, at al and how they relate to each other. I haven't enjoyed a series of books this much since I read RULES OF PREY and the rest of that series. Keep them coming Vince."
3,Good not his best,"I have read and enjoyed just about every book Vince Flynn has written. The books are throughly enjoyable. This book, however, was bogged down by political BS instead of just concentrating on Rapp and his mission. Sure you have to have the parts for his relationship with Anna and the impending proposal, but damn, it turned into a soap with his counterpart spy Donatella and thier relationship. That part dragged on with so much blah blah blah that it was almost tiresome to read. However, the conclusion totally makes up for it. It's a good book if you have read other books by Vince Flynn and know the characters. Don't start with this one, however, or you will never pick up one of his books again. He has written better before and since SOP. If you have read some of his other books and want some more background on the characters, than this is a good read. American Assassin is much better.American Assassin: A Thriller"
5,One of the best of the series.,"Recently finished the entire Mitch Rapp series. Separation of Power stood out as a non-stop, page-turner, can't put it down episode. Action taking place on multiple continents. Major elements going on both in Mitch's personal life & all the Washington power mongers. Definitely one of my favorites."
2,Paid by the Page,"I started reading this guy's stuff only recently, 2011. He is fine but it is so clear that he is now getting paid by the page and has no editor that reading his stuff is getting boring. He uses stuff like Tom Clancy does, ""inside"" names for weapons systems, and the tired old reference to ""Langley."" Anyone else notice the recurring theme to spy novels is to always blame everything on that darn old Langley? Tired of it. Vince, get an editor or program to get rid of your overuse of words like ""grab,"" and phrases like ""more than qualified."" Good for you that you get paid by the pound now but it's tiring."
2,The Domestication of Rapp,"How many times does a reader of a spy/thriller novel want to read the bickering between fiancees? Maybe once or twice, but this was way over the top. Unrealistic ""domestic"" dialogue hampers down this story and adds an air of unreality to an already improbable plot. I read this because I was blown away with Vince's ""Transfer of Power;"" thought it was a great book. Boy...was this a disappointment."
3,Separation of Power,The paperback book was in excellent condition. Shipping costs were excessesive for the very slow delivery.
3,"Timely, but some disturbing errors of fact ... sloppy","Yes, it's a nice action-thriller, but the darn errors will disturb readers with knowledge of military ops, arms, and technology.Some examples: Anyone who has ever read ""Dr. No"" (or seen the ""A View to a Kill"" movie) knows that the Walther PPK is 7.65 mm. Mr. Flynn has the weapon chambering a .22 AND firing through a silencer. Plop poof, Mr. Flynn.Aw, come on.. The US CENTRAL Command (Tampa) is responsible for operations in Iraq. Yes, the US Southern Command is also in Florida (Miami), but it worries about South and Central America, not Iraq as Mr. Flynn portrays.F-111s dropping bombs today, Mr. Flynn? No sir. No bomb-dropping F-111s available!This book would have benefited from a quick read by someone whohad some military experience."
1,Not every writer can be Robety Ludlum,"Vince Flynn's first book, Transfer of Power, was so exhilarating I had to force myself to put the book down at two or three o'clock in the morning, so I could go to work the next day. Term Limits put me to sleep before it was time. Separation of Power did the same thing. What happen?From the beginning, and through almost three-quarters of the book, you have to read the biography of every character, or get the size, dimension, color of every room, building, car, or a description of every scrap of land. I do not consider this worthwhile reading if you have to turn eight to ten pages (or more) at a time to get to the story line. It did not get exciting - the thriller part - until the last fifty pages.Not every writer is of the quality of Robert Ludlum, but Vince Flynn certainly had the potential with Transfer of Power. I hope he will regain that unique quality, and I can look forward to his next book."
1,Big Disappointment,"Flynn has fallen far from his first excellent efforts. I found the writing to be sophomoric at best and lacking in very basic research. Flynn has apparently never been to Italy (where I live) and doesn't know that coffee is not served ""to go"" as at a 7-11; He has apparently not traveled First Class either, or maybe doesn't understand that there is no higher fare a passenger can pay. Nonetheless, ""Reilly was lucky the AA agent did not charge her extra on her first class seat due to the change of date (pg 268) And finally, why does he have President Hayes act perplexed (pg 285) that disclosure of classified material is actually something on which he can legally hang his enemies? Please"
4,Excellent series,Can't get enough of this series! I am on to the next one within 10 minutes of completing Sepration of Power. Bravo Vince Flynn!
4,Exciting Page-Turner,"In typical Vince Flynn fashion, he has you at the edge of your seat with a lot of plot twists and turns. The only down-side is that the political situation(s) in the book don't exist today. However, if you can substitute Iran for Iraq the situation play out well."
5,Separation of Power,Another brilliant thriller! Vince Flynn knows how to weave a story of intrigue & suspense. Now on to the next.
5,A Page Turner at its Best,"Flynn with this novel puts himself in the class of great mystery/espionage/thriller writers. This story takes up where the last one ended. Irene is getting what she may or may not want with the death of her mentor she is now going to be at the helm. But, just was you suspect from the last 2 books the Senator and Representative are not going to let that happen if they can. But, the Senator has a lot more in store, including how to play the Representative.Also, Mitch is back and just as deadly.A great page turner that you don't want to miss. Especially if you have read the first two books."
5,Well done throughout.,Maintains the quality and style of Flynns writing. Well developed and totally engaging. Seven more words are required? You sure?
5,Mitch Rapp novels,"Excellent events, stories, characters. Very current. Enjoy the global and usa political, military, government services information. Great themes and line of thought."
3,More like a blog.,"I bought and read this a few years ago, and frankly I have forgotten about everything in it. It wasn't very memorable and certainly didn't stick with me over the years. My general impression of it was like a sort of stream of consciousness blogging effort, than any kind of autobiography.I do not possess the book anymore, so apparently I must have passed it on to someone else to read."
3,Was a great optical until it stopped working,Well I did use my mouse for UT2003 as one reviewer noted usebut i found it was rather heavy for online gaming and noticable lag on making turns PLUS THIS THING EATS BATTERIES like crazyhowever the ergonomics are top notchI still use it for net surfingbut the thumb buttons have all stopped workingand I have gone back to my trusty ball mouse for gaming
3,Only Average,"I cannot live without an optical mouse, and I got this one at work expecting it to be perfect. It isn't perfect. The tracking on it is great - it never sticks like the roller type and it moves smoothly without any jitter.My two main gripes are 1) It is too light. It is so light that it feels cheap. 2) I don't have large hands, but just setting my hand on top of the mouse causes the right click button to click. This is very annoying when trying to browse the net or work as it usually causes some type of popup menu to appear. I'd prefer it to be heavier and to make the buttons (especially the right click button) much smaller and a little harder to click."
2,terrible scroll wheel,"If you do a lot of scrolling, this is not the mouse for you. This one's very loose, very ""click-clacky,"" and just plain shoddy. When you press the scroll wheel button you get two clicks: when the parts finally come into alignment, and when the button is actually pressed. The same often applies for scrolling: an initial click for the wheel to engage with its gear, then a click as you actually turn the gear. Annoying! For this much money, the moving parts should be snug and responsive. I found myself absent-mindedly playing with it like a loose tooth, wondering when it would break entirely. You'll find that most children's toys have better moving parts. I think Logitech scroll wheels are better."
3,Extremely Comfortable but lacks precision,"I really would like to have kept this mouse because it fits my hand so well. But since I do alot of Photoshop, I was annoyed by the fact that the mouse goes to sleep and I have to wake it up. I also agree with the other reviews that you couldn't get the mouse to behave the same way as a ""wired"" mouse would for precision (but since this is my first ""wireless"" I have had no other exp).If you are looking for a mouse that is comfortable, this is a good candidate. It's nice when I do system admin or program, but once I start designing then :("
1,Caution (if you read this),"About a year ago I wanted to upgrade to an optical so I went to microsoft because of thier name is known for quality. I purchased 1 of their older versions of this product and It worked great for a few weeks, after that it became defective and would scramble up what it was reading through its optical sensor and sometimes randomly shuting off completly. I tried it on my other computer with the same problems so I bought another one with same results, after a few weeks it became defective. Ever since I have been a logitech mouse user. I know this is not the same model but still see other people having similar problems with this current model. I stongly advise you to be careful taking a chance with this product. If you want a really great mouse try any of the logitech mx series. They are the have the greatest optical technology out there and have great quality. If you've gotten this far, thanks for reading hope you get what you want :)"
5,"Outstanding mouse, best overall quality and features.","I have had two Intellimice over the last 5 years. I see many people complain that they become defective and require you to unplug and replug the mouse. The mouse itself has basically flawless technology. If you have problems with the mouse disconnecting, you need to have your USB controller checked out, or upgraded. It might even be an operating system issue. Could be buggy Microsoft software :), but I do have to commend Microsoft on this well made hardware accessory."
2,Has defect,"Just as one of the previous reviews, my explorer also disconnects forcing me to unplug and plug it again. I have reserched this a bit and it is a known flaw with some of the MS explorer mice in the market. Microsoft should refund the people who have this malfunctioning devices. I give it 2 starts becasue it has a great feel and accuracy but in my case it came with a fatal flaw."
4,Decent but not the Best,"I have just bought this mouse and expected a crazy comfotable fsat response time mouse. After using it, it was nice for desktop worknad uses but when it went to gaming, it was awful. In Counter-strike, i had to click the mouse seeveral times just to be able to shoot as many shots as 3 clicks on a regualr mouse. So, if you are a gamer, i wouldn't recommend this mouse, but if your not, i would recommend this mouse."
2,Very good if it doesn't break,I decided to shell out for what I believed to be a 'quality' mouse after putting up with cheap mice for many years. My first IntelliMouse v3 lasted about 6 months until the mouse wheel started misbehaving. It would occasionally scroll down a single line when I wasn't touching it. It started soft but over a few weeks got much worse. I took it back and got another one. This too lasted about 6 months until the same problem started up. In addition the back button is exhibiting the 'double-click' problem (where it sometimes goes back two pages even though i only clicked it once). And of course now it's no longer under guarantee!If it wasn't so badly built this mouse would be excellent. It's very comfortable to use and I love the extra buttons. Unfortunately I really cannot recommend it as it is.
4,Solid,Just hope it doesn't short out where the wire goes into the mouse like the previous models after about 2 years.
4,Not as comfortable as the Logitech MX500,"Microsoft still doesn't know how to make PC mice fit in your hand. It's a better fit than their first optical baseball, but the Logitech MX500 [got it from Amazon of course] is more comfortable."
3,Same problem as Tinderbox in spotlight review,"It worked really well and I was totally satisfied with this mouse until several months ago. (which means, after two years of usage)The problem slowly came up to the surface.Single click was started to be recognized as a double click.I'm kind of getting sense on how much pressure on the left mouse button determines single click or double click.If I press the button very lightly, it register as single click.If I press little bit harder, it takes it as double click.In scroll button case, they are reverted.Press scroll button hard makes single click and lighter makes double click.Now, I'm sick of it (since numerous times a day, I launch wrong application because of that double click problem), and considering buying logitech MX300"
4,Warning! Lower profile than the original model,"I loved my old Intellimouse dearly. I have very large hands and its high arch was great, and it functioned very well. When it finally died after two years of loyal service, I didn't hesitate to get another one. But they are not the same. They lowered the profile to the same level as their other mice, and I can sit them side by side to compare. Also, the left side buttons are much smaller. It's still an excellent mouse and I haven't seen a better one, but if you liked the old one (including the old Intellimouse Pro ball mouse, which was also very high) for the size, you should handle this new one first. On the other hand (har har), if you found the old one too high for you, you'll be happy."
4,A great mouse,"This is a great mouse; I have used both the original and the slightly modified second version and found both to be excellent. The additional two buttons in conjunction with the Microsoft Intellimouse software provides for acceleration of many tasks, including BACK for FORWARD when browsing the web, but can also be defined for specific applications (e.g. Word)."
1,Not a great adaptation.,"Not a great film at all. The screenplay suffers from trying to maintain too much of the narration, and the acting is ho hum."
4,The Size,"I had been searching online for one just like this and when I finally found it (perfect color and material) I did the mistake of not looking at the SIZE it was & ordered it quickly. I recently got it in the mail and was really disappointed with the size of it. Wished it could have been bigger. I will return it back, size is definitely not worth the price in my opinion. Over all its a very nice blankie. Just make sure you are ok with the size."
5,king kong of new york trivia,This book is a must for anyone who lives or has lived in the New York area. It is filled with wonderful bits of in formation from all walks of life. A book rich in the history of New York.Mr Barbieri has given us an enjoyable summer leisure book. Play New York trivia at the beach or the pool.
4,"Good Binder, But a Little Pricey","When reviewing a 3-Ring Binder, there's really not much you can say. The binder either works or it doesn't and it's either durable or it's not. There's also the price factor and if the binder comes with any extras. This 3-RING BINDER from Acco-Wilson is a typical, one-inch 3-Ring Binder. It works well for its size, has a sleeve pocket in the front and back, is rather durable. I've used these binders for work, school, and personal use and have never had a problem with them. The only negative is that these binders are a bit expensive. There not at all different from most binders available at retail stores that sell for about a half the price that they are sold for here at Amazon."
2,Stalking Santa,"I cannot write a review on the DVD because I cannot play it! We didn't know your DVD player has to be able to play DVD's from a different region! Waiting weeks for it to arrive and then not being able to play it was very disappointing. ""Playback Prohibited by area limitations"" was all we could watch on the blue screen:( Be sure when buying a DVD that it is formatted for the region you live in. Our sellers were most kind to us and we learned a lesson."
1,Disappointed,"I could not have been more disappointed in a DVD. I was expecting some sort of a movie like other Christmas movies, but this was one of the most boring wastes of time I have ever seen. I would really like my money back. No stars for this one!!!"
3,pure smokey,"This LP from the 70's is good. It dose not compare to ""A Quiet Storm"" but good just the same. Smokey's voice is great here."
4,"interesting, but not great","remember, wagner was an opera composer. this music is interesting to me because the symphony is my favorite musical form. so even knowing he was an opera composer, it was interesting to hear what he could do with this type of work. i'm glad he stuck with opera, where he was a true genius. it's not bad, just nowhere near the great symphonists like mozart, beethoven, tchaikovsky, mahler, etc. i give it 4 stars for the playing."
1,Lovely ballads on terrible-sounding CD.,"By themselves, The Interpreters' ""Be Kind To Love"" and The Steelers' ""Crying Bitter Tears"" would justify this CD's price if the remastering had been better (the songs by Teddie Morrow, The Hot Tamales, The Rising Sun and Henry Lumpkin are also enjoyable). The sound quality on most tracks, however, is so poor that it would put the worst bootleggers to shame- the end result is that this CD has nothing to recommend it."
4,Should be made into a film - fascinating book,"I kept putting off buying this while it was in print. I finally got an old battered copy now and I very much enjoyed it and must recommend it to anyone who has also been putting off reading this.A lot of the book is a historical rampage from anciant Jewish Berber Princess warriors to Bedouin trackers who solve murders just by looking at a footprint in the sand, there's also Arabs who win the highest military award in the Israeli army as well as anecdotes about the Rabbi of Gaza etc.The book is written in short bites which makes it good to dip in and out of.The only disadvantage is that the short essays and anecdotes sometimes disrupt the flow of the book. For that reason I have given this 4 stars instead of 5.Overall, this little book gives a much wider, far more interesting, perspective on Israel than the media can ever give and is very entertaining."
5,Excellent price on a quality product.,"I purchased two for my ""home theatre"" setting. They were shipped from California and delivered to the east coast in less than a week. A good looking quality product at an excellent price even when you consider the shipping cost. I'm very pleased."
4,Santa Fe Mission Recliner,"The first one received was broken due to transportation. They responded by sending another one that arrived in great shape. It looks exactly the way you see it in the advertisements, and is very comfortable. The only thing I would like to see is a 3 position recliner mechanism."
3,Purchase of Recliner,"100% Top Grain Leather Santa Fe Mission ReclinerI received the recliner in good condition, however it was not the color shown in the ad. But we accepted the other color as it also fit into our color scheme, though we would have preferred the other one. What we did not appreciated was that besides the shipping fee, they added on another $30.00 for delivering the package to the floor. When they arrived, my doorman called me that they refuse to bring the chair upstairs as it was a so called ""curb to curb"" delivery. I rushed downstairs and explained that I paid the extra $30.00 and upon arguing for some time, they reluctantly brought the chair upstairs. This is not acceptable. Furthermore, I don't understand why I have to pay an additional $30.00 (which was not explained nor discussed from the start) when I had to pay $120.00 for the delivery. This is not a good way to conduct business!!!"
1,Hair Vitamins,Never noticed any difference with hair growth while taking this product. I took it for six month's. Very disappointed in the product.
1,Too many pills to take,Too many pills to take to ensure if this product even works. I was not comfortable taking so many pills and the expense would add up after a few months. Trying Horsetail pills instead. You only need to take one and the product is cheaper and has good reviews.
1,Is this really necessary?,"From a band who released 3 studio albums, is a tribute needed? Did Slipknot actually influence someone? Im guessing the quality of this CD is bad at best, and the legion of crappy band members trying to do their best Joey Jordison and Corey Taylor fail miserably.Avoid this CD at all costs. Instead, buy the tribute to Maiden and Sabbath CDs."
3,Celtic Rosary,This was advertised with other Boondock Saints items but my daughter who is extremely knowledgable of all Boondock Saints items said it was not consistent with the one in the movie.However the item is beautiful just not what she expected.
5,wheelchair tray,Bought this from [...] through Amazon. Arrived in a timely fashion. Product is of good quality and works great on my son's transport chair. Using for feeding and therapy. Can easily hold several pounds. Velcro straps hold tray to arm of chair and are sufficient for my needs at this time. My son had spinal surgery and hopefully this is a temporary need. If it becomes permanent I will probably look into a tray that slides onto the arms of a wheelchair (and probably a new wheelchair).
5,Excellent Glasses for Everyday Use!,"These tumblers are excellent! Sturdy, easy to clean and classic design. I would recommend them to everyone who especially has kids with slippery fingers and adults who are not to be trusted with the fine crystal! Thanks!"
2,Three cracked within a week,"These glasses are very nice, seem sturdy and you get a lot for your money. However, we've had them for about two weeks and three have already cracked. I would love them if they were sturdier."
1,Broken!,I didn't even open the box... I picked it up and it sounded like every glass had shattered. The packaging wasn't even marked fragile!! Returned immediately.
1,Libbey Stonehendge 30-Piece Tumbler Glass Set,I was very disappointed when I received the set. I had 5 of the glasses in pieces when they arrived.
5,Glasses,"These look good, works good and easy to clean. I've yet to break any. The price made this set unbeatable."
4,"Good deal, but a couple glasses arrived broken","This is a good price for a nice set of everyday glasses. The three sizes are appropriate and the glasses have a solid feel and look just fine. I haven't tried stacking them, but look like they'll stack without issue.Only problem is 2 of the glasses arrived broken: not sure if I can blame this on the product or not (not sure if it was quality related or solely bad shipping). Amazon gave me a few dollars in compensation since I didn't want to send the whole set back."
3,break when stacked,"I agree these are a great value and look good too. The inner side of the rim is a little more square than the outer, which is about what you can expect at this price and it is fine for me.The problem I have is that we have already broken 2 or 3 glasses just separating them after they had been stacked (only 2 high). They are too fragile that way and shouldn't be marketed as stackable if they are not really stackable."
2,Evolution 11 Watt CR Full Spectrum Fluorescent Bulb,"This bulb is advertised as the size of a standard light bulb, and while it has the shape, it is too small for use with clip-on shades."
4,The Chase Is On,"Throughout his career in animation, Chuck Jones created an unique bundle of characters. Wile E. Coyote was based upon Chuck Jones himself. This collection, as part of Warner Brothers Golden Jubilee 24 Karat Collection, displays unique chases and humorous laughter. The duo of the Coyote and Road Runner, began in Fast and Furry-ous, in 1948. It had worked so well for Chuck Jones, that he was able to stretch Wile E. Coyote further. He even went up against Bugs Bunny, in Operation Rabbit. The first of 5 cartoons he would go after Bugs. The Coyote also spun off to the characters Sam Sheepdog, and Ralph Wolf. Ready, Woolen and Able, displays the similar knock off for mutton, instead of bird. There is no doubt that Chuck Jones created the most unique duo of characters ever. And this was the very first collection to the continuing chase of today. Beep Beep!! Wile E. Coyote Vs. Road Runner The Classic Chase is an real treat. I love it."
5,Loved it,My grandchildren wore out my copy that my daugher had bought for me years ago. I looked for a long time before I found this copy. They haven't worn this one out yet but it's not for lack of trying. I couldn't count the times they watch it - sometimes 2 or 3 times in a row.
2,Drake & Josh Songs from Hit Show,It was cute but after listening to the It's Only Time CD by Drake Bell it didn't seem that impressive. If you have a child who is just getting into the show they might like it. My son is 8 and he seems to only listen to it sometimes.
2,disappointed,I was disappointed in this album. Apart from the lead track by Drake Bell there was nothing else by him. The only other track to capture my boy's interest was their rendition of The Blues Brothers.
2,Only Good For One Song,"Okay, this CD kinda not as fantastic as some may make you believe. Don't buy into that lie they are feeding you. I will give it that Drake Bell is better than the Hillary Duffs and Lindsay Lohans of this world. But that really is not saying much. Drake Bell isn't quite up to the level of Robert Downey Jr., which again isn't saying much. Drake Bell's songs on the CD range from annoying to relatively abysmal. The only song that is actually worth my time is track 4 ""Uptight Staircase"" by the Hysterics. These guys are awesome. Much better than any of the drival that Drake churns out. I can't wait for those masters of melodious music to get their own album. HYSTERICS RULE!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Huh?,"I have more records of Menuhin than you could dream of a music fan! I have every single recording he did from 1928 Ries La Capricciosa to the latest recordings of concerti in the box set Menuhin concerto collection EMI. So I think my judgement is valid, the Lucerne recording on testament I have and I agree it's far better! Go Testament!"
2,Overrated,"Many classical fans have lauded this recording. I bought Menuhin's recording with Efrem Kurtz. The performance that EMI has hailed as one of the great recordings of the century. Well, Menuhin's violin is recorded so distantly that it's hard to hear him. And his version with Furtwangler has more insight, but his playing is lacking the smoothness and singing quality that Francescatti and Mitropolous brings to this work. If you believe that Menuhin is one of the best on this work, you should hear Francescatti. He'll make you change your mind."
3,Great Recordings Of The Century Dinu Lipatti,"A less than satisfying transfer of probably the greatest pianist of the century.Sound quality is rough and noisy. Lipatti was the epitome of style and form, translating beautiful music."
3,Get the live Besancon recording instead,"A decent album all around, but with some qualifications. Although Lipatti here plays the Bach Partita with a great deal of warmth, he doesn't quite possess Glenn Gould's contrapuntal clarity or interpretive imagination. The Scarlatti sonatas are lively but without the same nuance that Vladimir Horowitz imparts. Even Gould's limited Scarlatti recordings are a bit more compelling. The Mozart sonata K. 310 sounds a bit rushed; a better alternative would be Murray Perahia's recording of the same piece on Sony.If you're still looking for a Lipatti sampler, a much better album would be the live recording from his last concert in Besancon, France, made shortly before his death. It offers a more relaxed and expansive performance of the Bach Partita, along with the same Mozart piece, same Schubert pieces, and about a dozen Chopin Waltzes to boot."
5,History making sense,My daughter is working on her PhD in history and currently teaching at a university. She has found that nothing teaches history like seeing it. She teaches about working conditions and women and unions and found this video at the school library. She was impressed with the way this video shows the conditions and the circumstances involving all three areas of her program. I decided that this was a video that she was going to use constantly and to make sure that she didn't have to worry about if the library had it in or the quality of an overused video I would buy her her own copy for her library. Anyone who wants to see the struggles of the working woman and the role this tragedy played in the formation of unions needs to see this movie. For anyone just interested in history it is a real eye-opener and being so visual and documented it remains with the viewer.
2,Photo displays incorrect unit,"The photo shows an external drive, but the item was actually an internal drive? I went back and read the fine print, but if you just look at the photo you would think you are getting an external tape drive!"
1,bad,"This book is bad stuff because it doesn't emphasize eternal damnation in Hell. Without Hell and eternal damnation, God did not have to take on human flesh to die in a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins. John Stott really needs to read his Bible carefully. How could someone who doesn't understand this be saved?"
5,Amazing!,"I heard of this book while listening to David Platt (author of Radical) speak. This book was a clear and thorough explanation of what the cross of Jesus Christ accomplished for His people. This book is so needed, especially in this age of, frankly, ""dumbing down"" and diluting the true gospel to the point where the contemporary message being preached is not even recognizable when compared to the gospel Jesus and His first followers preached. Please get this book and share it's message!"
5,Beyond the Passion,"This would be an excellent book to read if you need more background material after going to Mel Gibson's movie the Passion.It starts with a history of church use of the cross. Then it moves into expository teaching on Bible verses leading up to Jesus' death on the cross. It also references non-Biblical sources like Josephus, Tertullian, Oliver Barclay, William Barclay and several contemporary theologians.Like other John Stott books it is logically presented with copious references. There are indices by Bible verse and by words in the text. There is also a comprehensive reference list."
5,Definitive,"A masterpiece - possibly the definitive work on substitutionary atonement, which makes it all the more important for the present decade, when there are many who claim to be evangelicals but deny this historic doctrine.Stott looks at the Cross from all angles, including its symbolic significance to the church, the reasons which necessitated it, and the consequences of it (theologically, personally, socially, etc.). One of the brilliant points that this book establishes is that though there are many pictures for the atonement (courtroom, marketplace, conquest, etc.), the concept of substitution is behind them all.D.A. Carson's endorsement was accurate: this is one of those rare must-own, must-read books."
5,"Clear-headed, running over with humility","This is my first venture into a work of John Stott. Absolutely fabulous. It is not often that detailed study into complex theological issues leave you with a tremendous feeling of humility. This one does. Concepts are presented clearly and, better yet, encourage further study. Especially helpful for those of us not in the ministry. The first chapter on the cross in historical context is worth the price of the book alone. And it just gets better from there. I now understand why this book is a classic."
2,Disappointed,Bought this for an 8 year old and the dinosaur didn't stand up on its own. Child was not impressed.
3,Not working completely in the US!!,"This is a great phone, unfortunatelly it is not EDGE as stated in the product specifications it is a 3G phone what it means is that is a UMTS phone, this capability is not fully launched in the US territory, be aware!!"
5,Fabulous way to work!,This product is fantastic! It's the easiest way to remember all the things I learned at my application courses and is so handy because it installs right in my application. The Mentor icon is embedded as an icon in the toolbar! WOW! I am so impressed! I can get my job done without searching through long text help files. The price is unbelievable!
4,Sad view of the Afghan War's Soviet fighters.,"In short ""Zinky Boys"" tells multiple stories from the USSR/Afghan Mujehideen conflict. In short, it tells the tales of sons, comrades, friends, lovers, and limbs lost and their effect on the people around them. It also shows how the Soviet government continually covered up the losses and severity of the conflict. Honestly, I found it depressing to read, but couldn't put it down. Not a ""history of the Afghan war"" so much as a tribute to those who sacrificed their lives on the Soviet side."
4,Lots of Fun,Came in good condition even though it was used. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to buy this game used and not pay a lot of money.
5,techno before there was any such,"a gift to disco angels direct from the early 1980s, when Italian space-music electronica stunned that era's Eurodisco boys with its goofy vocals, crackly metallica, and icy sounds-of-space and jets streaking -- techno in everything but name, and sung in exquisite tipsyness by an (uncredited) fly girl from Milan. how good does it get? In 1984 the 12-inch single sold 50,000 copies in the USA simply on (gay guy) club play and (stupefied!) word of mouth. A must own for true disco adepts."
5,A beautiful book but not his complete work,"It's a beautiful book but I would have liked to see all of his work and not just a small part of it. The book could have showed more of his earlier work, like ""The Family Tree"" and a few other that were very successful paintins and sold out as print. I had to buy the book ""Song of Creation"" to see 15 of the paintings that were missing in that book.For the fan of Carl Brenders, this book is a must although it is not complete. I hope he will eventualy publish a book with full reference to his work and in larger size. I don't mind if it would cost 100$ or more."
3,Other Books,"Morris West (or Paul West, if you prefer that name) has chosen a different setting for this novel. Rather than the modern Western setting, this book is centred in New Guinea.The title is an aboriginal or native word for drum, which is used to send a message or make a statement. In New Guinea, revolution is brewing, given a helping hand by one man."
5,"It works, but be careful!","Yes, it works. Like many other people, I switched to Hairtopia when H37 did nothing for me. You'll first notice a change in your nails. Heck, it even did something for my eyebrows. Hair growth I noticed within three weeks (not bad!) But BE CAREFUL when taking The Vitamin And Mineral capsules; they have Niacinamide in them, and this will cause your ears to burn blood red and your whole face and neck to heat up like an oven. I learned later, after a night of panic and a cold shower, that this is called The Niacin Flush, which can last for 30 min to an hour. Believe me, it feels like hot hell, but it's actually healthy for you. Just be ready for it, and NEVER EVER take these pills on an empty stomach!"
4,Yeah it does work,"To be perfectly honest this did make my hair grow alot. Im not really surprised because it contains alot of amino acids which help hair growth naturally anyway. After a month of using it EVERYONE AND I MEAN EVERYONE saw the difference in the length of my hair. The only advice i would give is to not take as many pills as it says to take. They say on the bottle take like 3 pills a day from each bottle. Which really in my opinion not healthy so i only took 1 pill a day from each bottle- the aminos, herbal and the other bottle. I took it for like 3 weeks straight and my hair was shiny, long and strong. And when you take one pill a day from each bottle instead of 3 not only is it healthier but the pills last longer lol. But it is a good investment."
4,Worked for me,"I purchased HairTopia Total a couple months ago. After a few weeks, I got sick of the huge regimen (10 capsules a day!) so I just started taking one pill from each once per day. At first, I just noticed that my hair was thicker, and I was growing more hair (like around my hairline - I got little curly fine hairs that weren't there before). I now have a widow's peak, and didn't before.After about a month of using the product, people started saying to me ""Wow! Your hair is getting so long!!"" And that was very nice. It also (immediately) made my fingernails grow twice as fast as they used to.I highly recommend this product. Gave four stars because of the price and unreasonable regimen."
3,"It works, but it's a pain in the butt!","These pills really did help my hair grow about an inch in one month, but you have to take SO many pills to see dramatic results! I seriously would sometimes gag by how many pills I had to down. I'm taking Viviscal now which works (although not as fast), but you only have to take 2 pills."
2,It doesn't work for me,"My hair is thinning in the front. I bought this package and hoped that it can help a little bit. I followed the instructions and 4 pills with breakfast, 4 pills with lunch, and 2 with dinner. After 3 weeks, I have not seen any difference. Surprisingly, I did not have any of those side effects other reviewers previously mentioned, like fast growth of nails. I feel bad about the money that I spent on this thing. Maybe it is really for maintaining the hair, not for growth."
2,Dissapointed with results,"I thought I'd try these pills out because I was desperate to grow my hair back after a terrible uneven haircut. I took them for one month and unfortunately, I didn't see any improvement with the rate of hair growth. My hair did grow- but no more than usual. These are too expensive and 10 pills a day is too many. They were not worth the money and I wouldn't recommend them. I will just stick to my regular multivitamin and wait for my hair to grow. Being impatient cost me over 50 bucks!"
1,It doesn't work,"I was very dissapointed with this product, especially for the amount of money i spent on it. I did not see any difference in my hair growth at all."
1,Do Not Buy!,I purchased this product for my daughter and was very disappointed with the results. Her hair grew at the same rate as it normally would. It was a waste of time and money. Taking 10 pills a day and not seeing any results is frustrating.
2,Okay,I've been taking these for over 3 weeks.. I have not seen any new hair growth. I think that new hair that does grow will be stronger but this has not caused my hair to grow any faster. I would suggest just buying hair supplement vitamins from GNC or any other place you can find them. They are much less expensive.
2,Results not as expected...,"I bought these after my stylist took a little too much length off of my hair last winter.I had really high hopes for this product, but after completing the entire regimen, my hair didn't grow any faster than it naturally does.I DID feel the ""hot flashes"" that everyone else mentioned... and taking that many pills in one day was really tedious. But I thought it would be worth it to give it a try.Bottom Line: don't waste your money. Instead, get the ""GNC - Hair, Skin, and Nails"" supplement or the ""Phyto Plage Phytophanere Supplements for Hair & Nails.""I've seen visible results, including stronger, healthier nails from both of these products."
3,AB,"This supplement was ok, not sure that I noticed too much of a boost. I will stick to my EAS products in the future"
5,A rich and complex gathering of meditations,"Kim Stafford is a natural storyteller. By that I mean he has an inherent gift for telling stories, and he pays attention to nature. In HAVING EVERYTHING RIGHT, the author takes a moment to look around him, at a place you or I might notice and walk past, or not notice at all. What he discovers he relates with skill. His essays resonate with interest, care, humor and sometimes even awe. In some ways it is a quiet book, but offers surprises and delight. Surely you will come away with an appreciation of how stories are not just published in books or magazines, but are part of who we are, and where we are."
1,Flim Flam,"I read an essay from this book, ""The Story That Saved Life."" It's horrible. It's not put together well. The story jumps around. I didn't like it at all."
5,Winner of the 1998 Gratz College Centennial Book Award,"""This is a judicial biography in the grand style, one which looks not only at the central actor, but at the law he influenced as well as the times in which he lived. We learn not only about Agranat, but about Israel, and about an area on which relatively little has been written in English, the development of Israeli constitutional law and the impact of American legal traditions on that development."" Dr. Melvin Urofsky Director, Center for Public Policy, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virgini"
3,good enough for some of the stuff,"passed the 070-271 on Friday 8/19 and am taking 70-272 on 8/24. Did need some other resources and the book does have a few mistakes in it as well, but they are easily noticed. not bad overall i guess"
5,Good prep book,"This book provides a good way of preparing someone for the MCDST exam. Most of the questions that I had when I took the MCDST has very similar ""situations"" as the questions and answers in the book. I was concerned at first with getting a book that covered both tests instead of getting one book for each exam. This book doesn't disappoint, in my opinion.Unless I got a later edition, the book does provide reasons why the answers to the questions are correct and why the incorrect answers are incorrect. The only issue I had was that there are some questions that list incorrect answers. Those errata are shown on the publisher's website, and the correct answer is explained in the book. I think there were only 5 questions out of the entire batch that has incorrect answers listed.Overall, it was an excellent book."
2,Sample Questions too confusing,"The Book is not bad, in general. The sample questions are very confusing because the author says the the correct answer for a given question is ""A"". Then right under that, when he explains why ""A"" is the correct answer he contadicts himself explaining that ""C"" is the right answer. I don't know... maybe is not the author's fault, maybe the editor was playing solitaire while correcting the book. Bottom line is, if your NEW to certification, this book is going to bring you problems, confusing you a lot."
1,no no no not this book,If you know x.p. pro in supporting enviroment then this book will be good for you. but if you are new to the helpdesk field like i was when i took this test. You will possibly due horribly like i did. Do your self a favor and pick up the self paced training kits from 70-270 and 70-271 by walter glenn. Much better books. much more thorough practice tests.This cram book is for people that wanna waste money.
4,good points and bad,"The book covered almost all material on the first exam which i just got back from passing. Many of the practice questions had a letter answer that did not match the explanation answer. It seemed like there was no proofreading of the questions and answers. The author also defers a lot of the subjects to other books. Overall the book was OK. I used only it, and test kings in order to study and pass the exam."
1,Be Wary!!,Many mistakes in this book. Many wrong answers. Many right answers but wrong explanations.
2,What happened with this book?,"I'm not sure what happened with this book. It almost appears as if it was written and published without any proofreading.Questions that are listed (with an A, B, C, or D response) to help you learn the material, have incorrect response letters associated with the answer. Not exactly what you want when you're prepping for a certification!Even though the Charles River Media web site lists the corrections, there are many other inconsistencies in the book that aren't listed on the web site, especially in the TCP/IP section which is a large portion of the 70-271 exam.To prepare for the exam, I purchased this book and a MeasureUp practice test (which had 150 questions and was very beneficial). I passed the exam but would not have if I had solely relied on this resource.The book does cover the material that you will find on the exam, but due to the many inconsistencies, I can not recommend it. It will leave you feeling unconfident and unsure. There are just too many errors!"
3,Good Resource but lacking for the Applications Exam,"This is a good resource, I wish it did not have as many mistakes as it did. The mistakes are easily spotted.I wish the second part of the book was covered much better, too many references to other books for a little more detail, it does not provide enough preparation for the applications exam and wished the CD had different questions than the practice questions in each of the chapters.Definitely a secondary resource is required."
1,too many mistakes,"There are more than a handful of mistakes in this book... in a few cases, the information provided is just plain wrong (i.e. pg 82 ""Unlike compressed folders and files, which can be configured to display in an alternate color, you don't know at a glance which folders or files are encrypted.""I guess you can't tell if you are color blind!"
5,works like a CHAMP - but is getting difficult to find,works like a CHAMP - but is getting difficult to findI use this for Fly tying and it's the best glue I have ever used!
2,battery cover/pocket clip fell off,"This tester works fairly well, but soon after I bought it the pocket clip fell off. It is also the battery cover. Now I have it taped on with electrical tape. Also, the first time I used it I forgot to turn it off and ran down the batteries. They are hearing aid style batteries and were a little expensive to replace. It does detect current."
5,Gardner-Bender Non-Contact Voltage Tester,A quick and effective way to check for voltage. Not sensitive enough for automotive 12 volt systems unfortunately.
2,Had to return it...,It works great to detect wires behind sheetrock or live wires but it broke easily and the batteries die quite fast... I had to return it to Lowes after using it only 3 times... Pretty dissapointed...
5,The Only Guide to a Winning Investment Strategy You'll Ever,"This book is an outstanding guide to personal investing. It will be useful to all investors from novices to highly experienced. This books perpares the reader to approach investing from the standpoint of the underlying science. It is the antithesis of a 'get rich quick scheme'. All aspects of Modern Portfolio Theory and passive (index) investing are explained in a through and easily understood manner. The aspect I like most is that as well as a solid theoretical foundation the book is very practical and shows the reader how to create (and more importantly) and manage over time a successful portfolio. This is a great book- for the beginning investor, it's a great place to start and for the experienced investor there are many valuable suggestions. This is the real deal- easily one of the best investment texts I've read. Matthew E. Dangel, M.D."
5,Good advice,"Swedroe's advice on investing is clearly presented, and well supported by both facts and modern market theory. His recommended strategy is very compelling. I have bought multiple copies of the book for friends and family."
5,Finally a book with a cogent strategy for Asset Allocation,"Swedroe expands the literature advocating ""proper"" asset allocation, the superiority of index funds and the pitfalls of active management and puts together a framework for the individual investor. Using risk analysis, he shows how to build a diversified portfolio using index funds that will optimize expected returns at varying risk appetites. This is a fitting conclusion to the search of the individual investor who has read Bogle, Berstein, Malkiel, Graham Clements and others and understands the concepts of risk/reward, index investing and portfolio rebalancing but needs a structure for developing a personal asset allocation strategy for the long term. Highly recommended even for those who haven't read the other authors."
5,A tool box that does the job.......,"This was an excellent book that covered all the necessary fundamentals without going into the excessive esoterica of the field that I, as a simple investor, did not need.It also provided useful formulas and guidance for fixed security investments based on the different scenarios that different investors might have.The book has definite views on total bond market funds as well as mortgage backed securities that you are not likely to find elsewhere and that every investor must necessarily know before investing.The title really says it all."
2,Interesting but wordy,"My investment knowledge is limited and still reading this book when I've decided to write this review. The author makes some interesting points, at least in the chapters I've read so far, but I'm sure he could have made his point in less pages. I don't know much about the markets and yet I got the points the author is trying to make and skipped though many examples."
3,A fashionable likeness of cylindrical awareness.,"A fashionable likeness of cylindrical awareness.This text brings about a swirling tunnel dreams of lavender negroids and children's television shows. This is a nod toward albinistic subjugation and filtered extremeties. This is a european americans paradise. It is like John Steinbeck for the white man. Jamie Pasley is a genius. He speaks to the European American coming of age in the 21st century. It resonates with everyone who grew up watching the original PBS childrens series on TV. I, like Pasley, will never forget the ZIP code for the greater Boston area, or what a S.A.S.E. is, or many other things thanks to the ZOOM kid's show. Pasley is right...that TV show was formative for all of us. I'm gonna ZOom Zoom Zooma Zoom! Welcome to the future!!"
3,Love the Concept,"While most travel journals are written by tourists (travelers if you must) who have either just become acquainted with the town they are writing about or have adopted it as their own. This travel book is unique (along with the rest in the National Geographic Directions series) in that it is by an author who has lived there all her life. That said, when I first read about the concept of these books, I thought they would be novels that were set in the writer's home town. In that way, the write could show us the town, but not have to do it in such a dry travelogue way. Still very interesting and worth the read, but I felt it could have been done in so much more of a literary and fantastic manner."
3,Beyonce-Life On Stage was Okay,I am a Beyonce fan so I bought this thinking she would be on it telling her story and adding something that had not been told but she wasn't on it at all. It only had other people telling her story. It was okay but most of the info I had already seen in other TV shows with her in it. Buy it if you are a fan and don't know much about her but if not by something else to support her.
3,"Fine for the price, I guess.","Pretty flimsy. Looks nice, though. I wish Seiko/Pulsar had a little heavier or stronger version than what is being offered now. Unfortunately, Seiko no longer makes the model that I bought 5 years ago. I guess I can't complain for $69, but I would have rather paid more and gotten a better quality watch."
5,Undiscovered Gem,"James Judd and the Royal Philharmonic give a remarkable performance of Holst's masterpiece. Each section is phrased beautifully, unfailingly evoking the essence of its theme. Mars is hard-hitting with thrills galore, yet doesn't cross the line between musical excitement and in-your-face bombast (like the popular Dutoit version). Venus likewise captivates, its other-worldly beauty bringing thoughts of complete serenity. I could go on... Before you heed the reviews and purchase the Dutoit cd, give a listen to this undiscovered gem. It may turn out that JJ/RPO's performance of ""The Planets"" will be the one you'll want to blast-off to."
5,This is the best version,I have heard many versions and variations of Holst's The Planets and this is the one I found to be the best and the most enjoyable. There is not much else I can say. This is the one you want.
1,Don't reccomend buying this punch bowl set,"I was desperate to have a punch bowl for a function I was having. When I saw this on the internet it looked lovely. However, when it came in the mail, I was very disappointed. For one thing the glass bowl resembles more of a fish bowl than a punch bowl. Also, one of the glasses cannot stand up on it's own without liquid in it. The handle on the glass is too large causing it to be off balance. I would have returned it, but it was the only option I had at the time."
2,Be very careful with it.,"I agree with the reviewer earlier, it is definitely way too thin. I used this punch bowl only once, and it was beautiful. What I liked most about it was it was big enough so I didn't have to constantly refill it, it was very simple to look at and it was inexpensive. I was extremely careful with it, pulling it out of the box carefully, washing very slowly and gently. However when I wanted to use it a second time, as I was gently pulling it out of the box like the first time, the top just cracked in my hand and the glass went right into my thumb almost slicing it in half. And this is after I was being SO VERY CAREFUL with it. This punch bowl is beautiful and big, but very poorly designed. It really is not worth all the hassle!"
1,Too thin,"I borrowed this punch bowl (new) from a friend for a party. The glass is so thin that it broke in the hand of our catering helper as she was holding it by the rim to wash it, cutting her hand."
3,Beautiful but not practical,I thought this was a beautiful set but it's just way too delicate to be used very often. I am afraid to use it because I think if the ladle were to hit the side at all it would probably shatter.
1,"breakable - not for more then 1 use, if you are lucky!","Like the other reviews, this product looks nice but will not last. I purchased mine and even before using it -- but putting it in storage, the punch bowl broke in my hand while rinsing it. I was fortunate not to have a cut. This should be noted as a DEFECTIVE product and dangerous for use."
2,way too much for what you get,"Save your money. Neither song is worth buying at the price offered. If you really have to have the b-side, get one used."
5,Fantastic CD!,This is one of the best bass recordings I have heard. The recording is well produced and the orchestra sounds wonderful in it's accompaniment. The Ziguenerweisen has to be heard to be believed. Most violinists would envy Quarrington's tempo!
5,the best of all,"I have another flashligts, like maglite and toologic, but when you try this one, no one can compares, it's a lot brigther than the others, when you put a maglite 4D with a luxeon bulb and the coast together you can notice the diference, the coast is like three to four times more brigth than the other competitors, buy this flashlight its the best."
4,Pretty great actually,"After breaking yet another Maglite, I decided to go for more subtle, flashlight at a more practical size. I figured I would give up some power but I was wrong. This flashlight is crazy. It's so bright, I actually used it as a makeshift headlight when my alternator died one night and I had no headlights. This shoots a strong focused beam over 700 feet out and is bright enough to temporarily blind someone. I flashed myself as a test and saw stars for nearly five minutes. All this power from three AAA batteries and a single long-lasting LED bulb; How can you go wrong?"
1,"Where, oh where have all the French flutists gone?","Oy. This is an unbelievably horrible recording by two of the most unbelievably talented and accomplished French flutists of all time. Marion played like a G-d before he split. His sound, technique and articulation were unsurpassed by anyone. PERIOD. But, man, the French seem to have the worst taste in the world when it comes to, what they would call, jazz. ""Le jazz"" is played well by many French jazz musicians, but when classical players attempt it, it sounds like, nay, it is, a farce. Stick to Mozart. You certainly knew how that stuff goes!!!!"
3,Rain or shine,"This is the author's first book of verse, proclaiming the power of peace, love and light. The unusual photos perfectly illustrate her vision."
1,Did Not Work,"This product was very inexpensive. However, I still expected a quality item. I could not get my all in one to accept the cartridge, it would show an error message, ""black ink cartridge missing"". I tried everything to address this message, nothing worked. I finally gave up. I didn't call or contact the vendor, sometime it's not worth the hassle of trying to return an item. It cost less than two dollars, so I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Shark Liver oil,"I purchased this product and nowhere on the box, bottle, or pamphlet does it say what it is made from other than ""squalene"". I assumed, silly me, that this was squalene derived from olive oil having never heard of any other kind. With some digging I found that this is a fluid extracted from shark livers. As someone who does not support the killing of sharks I would not have bought this product had I known that was the source.That said, I have nothing to say about how this product actually works as I will not be using it--just wanted to provide a little bit more information for those who are interested."
5,No More Dry Skin!,"This stuff is amazing. Can be used alone, can be used as a nitetime treatment. I also mix a drop or 2 in my regular face creme when I need a little extra moisturizing."
1,Southwest BabaYaga,"As a child I loved Baba Yaga stories. Her house with chicken legs was wonderful. Now meet Alice Nizzy Nazzy, the witch of Santa Fe. With road runner feet and cactus yard, Alice is a Baba Yaga for America. Tomie DePaola's wonderful illustrations perfectly capture this retelling of the classic tale."
1,Do Not Buy Will Not Work,This product does not plug into Toshiba A105-S4014 laptop. I ordered one sent it back and recieved another and they will not plug into any of the three Toshiba A105-S4014 laptops I own.
4,"Not quite at my present skill, but I'll get there.","Learning banjo from John Hartford would be like learning driving from Dale Earnhardt, Sr. But I love the chance to get an up close view of a master's hands in action. And I have picked up some real good help on tone. Great video."
4,Keeping the Faith-an unknown gem,"Steve Laury was the lead guitar player for the contemporary jazz group, Fattburger, until 1991. Keeping the Faith is Steve's second solo release. Steve's primary musical influence was Wes Montgomery, and you can hear his influence in Laury's playing.Steve is a very religious fellow, having survived a rare form of cancer several years ago. This CD was produced while he was fighting the big C. Ron Satterfield, of the group Checkfiled, plays piano and vocalizes on this CD. It's a must buy for any fan of contemporary jazz"
5,Trellis for Square Foot Garden,"Since this is five feet wide netting you have just enough to cut the outer squares and use those loose ends to tie it on a four foot wide conduit trellis frame. Tying up one 4x6 section of this trellis took about 45 minutes.Using this trellis netting is definitely easier than the first trellis I built by tying together my own nylon string (that took a few hours and was frustrating).For a tiny bag of nylon, the price for this trellis seems high, but at $16 it was the cheapest nylon trellis I could find.FWIW, I setup my garden with several four foot square beds and the electrical conduit trellis frames as described in ""All New Square Foot Gardening""."
5,Useful & Strong Netting,This netting is very strong. It's a large amount of netting & has been great for cucumbers and peas.
5,Square foor gardening tool.,This stuff is amazingly strong and guaranteed to not break or rot. i am using it for trellises for my melons and eggplants and squash to climb or support tomatoo plants. You can't break it and it takes the elements. the square foot gardening methods touted by Mel Bartholmew recommends it and it is one of those products you can't usually find locally and one that you can't believe will last or support a ten pound melon but it works flawlessly.
1,"Good product, bad packaging.","The package of netting looked just like the photos, i.e., a lot of string in a plastic bag. I opened the package, trying carefully to unfold the netting. I failed and the result was about 8' of useable netting and 22' more in a snarled mess.To be fair, the 8' section that I could use seems to be holding up well so far. I just wish that Dalen had a better packaging system for its product."
2,What size !,"Bought the netting for morning glory's as a trellis, Only problem is the bed is 4ft wide and the netting is 44"". Not quite the 60"" as packaging states. Not to mention the first 3 rows had breaks in the squares."
4,A little issue,"I bought this for a relative. When I was putting the netting up, I noticed the squares were larger than I had expected. If you're putting this against a fence then I'd say it's absolutely perfect. If you're making a 5 foot square netting around veggies then it may not be as reliable. Veggies along a fence have the support of the fence also while veggies that are solely relying on this net do not. The squares should be half the size in my opinion for the common veggie.Also, the coloring makes it stand out unless it's against a PVC fence. It really stands out actually. I can see it from 30 yards. Once the plants grow on it - it'll likely become impossible to see. My question is, they dyed the netting so why not dye it green or brown to blend in better?To spite my views, this is the best I have come across for trellis netting and the price is nearly impossible to beat.I would highly suggest this."
1,MISLABELED: Did not recieve 30 feet!,I needed 30 feet of trellis. The ad says 30 feet. The package says 30 feet. My tape measure says 25 feet.So I only got 85% of what I paid for.
5,Dale Gardeneer Trellis Netting,"This is the second time that I have bought this product. I attached this to steel electrical conduit pipes in two of my gardens to make an excellent trellis for a vegetable garden. I have had one trellis up for both the spring garden and now again for the fall garden and it is still like new. I have since added a second one, because I like it so much. I live in Texas and it has survived 45 mph winds with the trellis still tight and strong on the frame and the plants still firmly attached to the trellis. The best thing about it is that you can reach through the back of the trellis to pick your crop as well as from the front. I love this stuff! I found this locally at a garden store, however, I was able to buy twice as much on Amazon for the same price."
4,Great product for the price,This is a nice product for the price. I am experimenting with different trellis options. My latest one involves a 5' tall by 10' wide PVC trellis. Now this trellis requires some kind of support intertwined. I was first thinking of steel fences - too sturdy in my opinion for cucumbers and beans. Then of course you could use the green twines and do a zig-zag pattern. Or you could avoid all the hassle and get this net. I got it and then attached it to the PVC trellis using wire ties. The squares in the net are about 4 inches wide. The wire was less thicker than I thought but still looks sturdy. I think it should work great for the cucumbers and pole beans it will support.
4,Tasty but out of date...,Very tasty. I began to use them in baking cookies for xmas time but noticed they had sent an expired bag. Amazon refunded me right away but never was able to get a current bag.
4,"Good, with odd texture. NOT a caramel in the traditional sense.","The caramel here is a flavor description, not a texture one, which seems to have put some other reviewers off.These are very sweet, without quite being cloyingly so, even with the honey note. The honey/caramel mix is a very unusual flavor combo, extremely rich and I can understand some reviewers being turned off by it.The texture less a 'crumble' as it is a dense, slightly grainy fudge, not unpleasant, but it takes some getting used to. I believe the grainyness is from crystalized honey, as the other flavors lack this texture.Overall, a candy that offers a different flavor and texture profile, well worth a try."
3,Chaos prone,"Will not work with Vista, because the disk protection will not load into Vista. Works ok in XP and is somewhat fun."
2,Sleeper Cell review,I have had this item a long time didn't know I had not reviewed it. From what I remember I got tired of learning how to make the guy move his arms and lags I am more of a point and shoot type. But the item was in good shape when I got it.
4,Worth the Money,"I had no problems with StarForce. The game ran fine on my X850XT, and it had great (some of the best I've heard in a game) voice acting. The story was ok, but the missions made up for it. The controls were a little odd at first.If you've exhausted the Hitman series and are looking for something more or less similar, go for this."
4,Good background on songwriting,"Like the book says, it's a complete guide to the craft of songwriting. The book covers several in-depth subjects like the history of songwriting, how various type of songs came to be popular, loads of information about the use of musical theory, and various approaches to writing songs. I'd recommend this book for any serious musician or novice songwriter."
2,Great History Lesson,"This books gives a great history lesson, trouble is, I wanted to read a book about business leadership! I could only make it half way throught the book, maybe the second half was better."
5,Pleasant way to Exercise,"Winsor Pilates sculpting circle work out is an enjoyable way to exercise and you see results without it being difficult on joints as most are. Having bad knees, most routines are too harsh but this is a wonderful way to keep in shape."
4,Light and Lovely,"The selections are sprightly and beautifully played. The piano accompaniment is sharp, sensitive and of just the right amplitude.It is music to be heard with the heart as well as the ear."
2,Very Mac-centric,The book is very Mac-centric. While a few charts include windows key commands all screen shots are Mac screens and look VERY diferent from Finale98 for Windows. Only in guitar chord creation does this book venture past the online and in-the-box documentation of the program itself.
1,Implausible Story Line,"I latched onto this author with Shadow Box, Haven and Mosaic, all enjoyable. I couldn't finish Bannerman's Promise and thought Maxim might redeem himself with Whistler's Angel. It could just as well been titled Bannerman's Angel. None of the characters were believable. The dialouge was straight from a ""B"" movie. The villains, a parody of ""The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight."" The only reason I finished this book was because I had no other book as a backup. Unless you're happy with the Bannerman character, I'd advise all to save their money, and I hope Maxim regains his touch."
5,gray area morality with a added twist of mirth,"The eternal battle of good and evil becomes relative in this extraordinary tale of behind the scenes manipulation. Maxim has outdone himself with eccentric, but believable characters. Aubrey, Poole and their henchmen almost steal the limelight as Maxim lets you enter their twisted minds. You almost feel sorry for them as you delight in Adam's, Harry's and Claudia's triumphs. Nobody writes women better than JRM or has the ability to do the breadth and depth of character development in general. The exchanges between father and son ring true.The building of the relationship between Adam and Claudia is especially well done. Bravo for a novel that is thrilling and at times just plain fun."
3,Not quite Bannerman,"I found Whistler's Angel enjoyable rather than outstanding. I loved some of John Maxim's other books, but would rate this one as OK in paperback, but I'm glad I didn't buy it in hardback. If it was a movie, I'd call it a rental rather than a movie to see in the theatre...Still, it's not a bad way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon and I'd read it again."
2,"Works, but died after 2 years","July 2012:It died after a little over 2 years of regular use.I liked the touchpad, which had a good, responsive feel to it. But I didn't like the cheap, mushy keys. The Esc key broke off with normal use about a year ago, so had to glue it back in. And like others have mentioned, the driver will flake out every now and then and you have to re-plug the device to resume normal behavior.ThePerixxI bought to replace it is worse, though, so I'm done with these wired keyboard/touchpad combos."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Arguably, one of the worst items of technology I have ever purchased. To call this ""technology"" would be an insult to anyone working in the High Tech Industry. Within 2 days of purchase, the screws on the back of the keyboard started to fall out; within 4 days of purchase, the keys started to ""stick"" and became very difficult to use; within 7 days of purchase, the keyboard stopped functioning properly and would wildly perform commands that were not the commands that were being ""keyed"" on the keyboard; within 10 days of purchase, the keyboard started to break down more regularly and could no longer function in a trustworthy manner; on the 11th day of purchase, the keyboard was thrown in the trash!Save your money and don't buy this. The Touch-Pad funtion is really nice, which is why I purchased this, but if the keyboard doesn't work, it doesn't matter what neat function is on it, it still won't work!Don't buy this, unless you too want to throw your money away!"
3,Fix for freeze!,"I recently upgraded the driver and my system started freezing randomly, requiring a reboot. I determined that the problem occurs when either I or a process does a copy operation (Ctrl-C, Edit-Copy, auto-copying an address from within Google Maps, etc. I then discovered that if I unplug the USB cable from the computer (waiting for the remove tone) and then plug it back in (counting to 5) the system unfreezes and I'm good to go. This is a tremendous drag, but at least there's a fix short of rebooting.On the plus side, after two years of heavy use I wore out two keys, and contacted Adesso Support, which mailed me two replacement keys immediately at no charge."
3,Win-Touch Pro USB Keyboard - Love/Hate,"I love all the features and ergonomics of this keyboard, but the touchpad continues to freeze up at least once a day; then you have to shut down and reboot your computer to get the mouse to work again. My husband is a pretty savvy tech guy, so I'm sure it's not due to his installation. I am trying to find another touchpad keyboard (it took me long enough to find this one!) to replace it and, once I do, this one will go to the electronics recycling. Very sad about that."
3,Historical Document,"Before you buy this, be sure that you realize that this recording is absolutely ancient. When I say ancient I mean late 20s and early 30s. There are many advantages to having this recording, the most notable of which is that Sir Elgar himself directs the orchestra. There's something magical about hearing a piece conducted by the composer. The only drawback is that the recording is from the 20s and 30s. Therefore, the recording is not very high quality and some of the nuances of the music can get lost. If you're looking for historical documentation, this recording is elsewhere. Otherwise, it will behoove you to find a more modern recording if you simply want to enjoy the music."
5,Simply Menuhin,"I heard twice in my life this concert, I liked so much, specially because has serenity and peace. This Menuhin version conducted by Edward Elgar, is simply pure. I heard the last records of Menuhin, but I never heard him in his first years, simply I don't cry because ...you know, but in some cirscustance of my life if I would heard the Munuhin Solo, simply I could not resist,his natural sound, his phrasing, the solo in the third movement has a sense of nostalgy, with a beautiful vibrato, sorry for the others big masters, but this ""carisma"" only Sir Yehudi Menuhi. He really was a natural prodigy with a big carisma, if you don't believe me heard him. If not buy the DVD about him, and pay attention to the solo, while he stay with his ""Mamina"". Buy it you really enjoy. And my respects to Yehudi Menihin, a wonderful violinist of the 20th century."
2,Disapointing recording.,"I hoped this recording would have been acceptable; EMI and their Great Recordings of the Century cds are normally economical and musical, but this album is not good. The recording has some hiss, which is to be expected as the master was recorded around 1930, but there is horrific distortion at the climaxes in the music which is not acceptable. This recording was conducted by the composer, but the orchestra is less than adequate; for example, the violins are sliding into pitches almost constantly through the variations, particularly Nimrod. The effect is, to me, nauseating. There are much better recordings of these pieces to order, unless perhaps, you are purchasing it for historical reasons (Elgar conducting) or for the solo violinist."
5,Fascinating Book,"This book offers ""down home"" reading at its best- Mr. Gierach captures your attention and your imagination. Sit back and relax and follow the exploits of a true sportsman!"
2,warehouse destroyed this binder,"The binder is fine, a typical inexpensive white binder, but A4 size...however, it arrived very dirty with ingrained smudge marks down corners --even inside edges! -- and heavy, greasy, black dust particles ~2-3 mm average, not only stuck to outside but deep down under the tight plastic outer cover = hard to remove and the plastic is now stretched.Amazon just happened to sell it to a person with the tenacity and expertise to be able to clean all this up but it was time consuming and highly irritating for the price I had to pay just for an odd-sized binder of typical cheap quality. I love new office products but this was disappointing. The warehouse's fault not the manufacturer."
1,DON'T BUY,"Ok first of all this is the worst Playstation controller ever created. Don't be fooled buy it's looks! Every time you press the X,O, Square, or Triangle button you get a bad finger burn. I tried to play my ""Tony Hawk's Pro Skater"" Playstation game with this controller and because the whole direction pad is one button I couldn't do one skateboarding trick without messing up! My warning to everyone, THIS CONTROLLER IS NOT WHAT YOUR LOOKING FOR!"
4,Drummers heaven,I saw them in concert recently and was amazed. The disc is very good but doesn't convey the thunerous drumming you get in person. Recommended highly however!
2,amateurish,"This book contains many details about the von Trapp familly - but is not really about Agathe's life. I'm sure it was meaningful for her to write this book, but it is filled with many little anecdotes which don't really connect into a coherent whole. It has very little of Agathe's personal perspective. I found it very hard to stay interested even though I am interested in the von Trapp family. Maria's book, ""The Trapp Family Singers"" is much better written. However if you want more details about the early life of the von Trapps this may be the only way to get it."
3,Has it's moments both good and bad,"I enjoyed the details on the Von Trapp life and world before the Captain met Maria. Having read Maria's ""The Story of the Trapp Family Singers"", I was surprised to see that portions of this book read almost word for word like ""Story"" though.I have heard from other sources that Maria was not a perfect mother and wife (and I think she admits as much in her later book ""Maria"") but I think that Agathe seemed to go out of her way to cast Maria as negatively as she could without outright slander."
5,Great watch for the money,"For the $67 I paid, I feel like it was a steal. It obviously is not a $500 watch but for a good looking everyday watch that's easy to read and has some style I love it. I'd had a Pulsar Railroad Approved several years ago and liked it. For some reason I gave it to my brother. When I started looking again I found that Pulsar had redesigned this watch and it is better looking than ever. I didn't see any advantage to the Seiko, especially for the money difference. I considered the Citizen but a lot of reviewers claimed the silver hands made it harder to read and in my experience Citizen crystals seem to scratch rather easily. Also some people complained about the clasp. The Pulsar has a double pushbutton locking clasp.Like I said, if this is the style of watch you're looking forI don't think you can beat it. Especially for the price"
1,"SAVE YOUR MONEY,IT'S JUNK",THE FIRST TIME I PULLED THE STEM OUT TO SET THE DAY IT WOULD NOT RETURN TO THE SEALED POSITION. YOU WOULD THINK THEY TEST IT BEFORE IT GOES OUT.
4,"Great watch, So-So band.",The watch itself was everthing I thought it would be at a great price. The band did not fit. I tried to adjust it but it would not change. I had to take it to a jewler and pay 10$ to get it right. Over all I am very happy with it.
5,Pulsar railroad watch,I get a kick out of just looking at it! And polishing it. And checking it against the NIST clock. My watch is ACCURATE.
2,Kind of BLAH!!!,I would only recommend this for absolute beginners....although there is a few pieces of good information most of it is most likely already known to you if you have been playing online for any amount of time. 'SO-SO' D+
3,it was a good game when i was 10 years old,"this game is mostly for the younger audiences and adults and teenagers will find it boring. You walk around the Masked Mutant Headquarters and help the League of Good Guys (WHAT AN ORIGINAL TITLE) fight the mutant. The cartoony graphics are something to look at, the story is straight forward, but short. Long for little kids, very short for adults and teenagers. Does anybody buy this game anymore?"
4,kids like it,"the game was in good condition and received in a timely matter. i purchased the game for my kids and they like it. they had this game a while back and it got lost or broken. i was pleased to see that it was still available. needless to say, they are continuing to enjoy the characters and gameplay. I also appreciate the reasonable prices. Thank you to all persons involved."
4,Cute Comic Book Mystery,"This is overall a cute game. The characters are funny. It makes excellent use of the DS stylus and is easy to play. It is a completely linear mystery game, meaning you cannot do steps in any other order. There is only one outcome, so you can't screw up. This is nice in the way that its more like reading a comic book mystery, but sometimes not so fun if you can't figure out what the heck to do next. There were some steps in the game that seemed completely bizarre, and I really would not have figured out what they wanted me to do without reading an online game faq. Or you had to talk to people in a very specific order, which made it difficult to figure out what I hadn't done yet. Overall, I enjoyed it."
3,"Very Cute, But a Little Slow","Stylistically this game is a gem. It's got a very creepy/cute vibe to it that can't be beat. The story and characters are charmingly weird. The game play is where this product gets bogged down. Each situation requires clicking the right place or using the right item. Most of the time the answer is obvious, but there are many situations where the item you need makes no sense. This randomness is supposed to add to the game's weird cute charm, but it drags the actual game play down.Still, if love cute things and you're willing to go over a few speed bumps this is a very enjoyable game."
2,Don't know what all of the rave was about,"I played the game. It wasn't great, in fact it was fairly simplistic and not challenging. I found the plot kind of dull and irritating. I am not sure why it is rated for adults either. A child of 8 or older could easily handle this game. Just not impressed."
4,Wonderful and Delightful,"Quite simply, it's great, though a bit on the challenging side. Gorgeous art style and some great music come together for an atmospheric title, and one that, despite it's 'rated 'E' for everyone' approach, will appeal to adults as well as kids. It's not without some light frustration, but the good far outweighs the bad.Ignore the mediocre reviews and pick this one up. Replay value is in the four different cases, as well as some unlockable minigames and a 'touch' list. If you like adventure titles like Phoenix Wright and Trace Memory (or Maniac Mansion, for that matter) then you'll really dig this game.A good solid four stars."
3,"Custom cables required for PS2, and just like every other KVM doesn't do proper USB keyboard support","I read several reports that said this KVM worked with the G15 keyboard. What they weren't clear about was the fact that it only ""works"" if you plug the keyboard in the USB hub ports on the back, not the keyboard port on the front. That means you can't do hotkey switching via the keyboard. Many KVMs ""support"" extended keyboards that way. Had I known that when they said it supports it I would've gone for something else. Live and learn."
4,The complete EARLY Madness,"The Complete EARLY Madness would be a more suitable title, since this album covers their late 70s and early 80s period only. They had lots more hits later that decade and there are more comprehensive hits collections available. But this one captures them when their music was still fresh and innovative - the ska period proper. Always the least serious of all the Two Tone bands, Madness were clearly in it for the fun as their happy, bouncy music demonstrates. The Prince, their tribute to Ska legend Prince Buster, and their theme song Madness, have propulsive rhythms and there's catchy hooks aplenty throughout the album. My favourites include Night Boat To Cairo, One Step Beyond and Return Of The Las Palmas 7. They never established themselves in the USA but did have one major and one minor hit there. Together with their Two Tone stable mates The Special, The Selecter and The (English) Beat, Madness made rock history and their best work remains delightful today."
5,Madness for those on the go...,"Road trips are wonderful things. They do, however, require a bit of forethought. If you could take only one tape with you (anyone remember cassettes?), this would be the one to have on those extended drives. Upon its release, Complete Madness was the band's capping acheivement, a brilliant compilation put out before the phenomenal success of 'Our House.' It contains the wonderful 'It Must be Love,' the hard to find, 'House of Fun,' and the rarer still 'In the City,' a song featured in a Japanese car commecial circa early eighties. Nutty pleasure to the extreme. Enjoy."
1,East of the Sun West of the Moon by General Books,"This classic norse tale is wonderful but DO NOT purchase the copy from General Books, which came with typos from cover to cover. It has been printed with character recognition software which makes no distinction for certain Scandinavian markings which it turns into unintelligible mush. The book sent was also partial, only the beginnings of the book, and it breaks off in mid-sentence. It is totally unreadable and this publisher totally unreliable in the books they send, which are also quite expensive. Save yourself the trouble of a return and go for a nice, illustrated and professionally edited version."
5,"5 star, but...","I still don't think it's quite as good as the original cd. Granted, songs like Nowhere Kids and Bottom Of The Bottle (the singles) weren't all that great, but it was the other songs on the cd that made it a classic...songs like Eraser, The Other Side, For You, Every Sunday...well basically the whole cd. Anyway, there's some great songs on this cd as well like Out To Sea, The Hit, The Freaks.... etc.My only real complaint is that this is actually their 3rd cd but due to issues with the label the 2nd cd, Anxiety, was never actually released. If nothing else you have to try and download (probably illegally since the legal sights make it seem like the album never existed) Bright Side and To The Ground as they are incredible SES songs you need to add to your collection. Anyway, good cd, but so was Anxiety and it should have been released as well..."
3,Interesting but sexually dull and contrived,"I have read a few of the author's works, but this one took almost 300 pages before the characters got together. Also, the last minute mini-intrigue with Cassie and Elizabeth's daughter was ill-contrived and poorly written into the plot."
3,OK,"Don't get me wrong. I like this album and the Skygreen Leapords are one of my favorite bands. But I was a little disapointed with this album. I have always like the ""outerspaceness"" of their previous albums. This is more conservative. It is not other-worldly like their pervious works, but grounded in the West Coast folk sound. Byrds...Which is nice. But I I hoped they would have blown my mind like their last EP.The album has grown on me over this week, but...I feel I will be listening to their last couple albums and Ivytree again soon.Looking forward to the next one!"
3,Neat!,The one we have lights up and is pretty cool. Another classic to have but suggest shopping for the light up one it is made well. Another great grab bag gift for kids.
2,A Disappointment,"I sent this toy to my 10-year-old son at summer camp. He said that it was fun, but unfortunately it ""broke"" soon after arrival. The metal balls on either side of the wheel got pushed in and rendered the toy unusable. When he got home I tried to fix it, but again the metal balls would not stay in their proper position."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THESE TOY,I bought these toy because it was at great price but when you want to ship it it will cost you $5.oo. And it also takes for ever to get to your home.
2,"great old toy, cheaply updated",I remember buying one of these for my kids in the 70s. It was larger and sturdier than this one I got for my grands. This still works the same way but it's like a Yugo compared to a Benz. Still rolls...
2,"Cheaply made, not really worth the cost.","It's cheap, it's cute, it doesn't work well. It's worth about a dollar. Don't get this cheap thing unless you are looking for a cheap toy under 5 bucks that needs to wow someone for a minute."
4,I want to get more as gifts :),This is a toy from my childhood. I bought this for a friends child and will be buying more for other children who've never seen one....they enjoy this toy.
1,A Gimmick by any other name...,"This is a fascinating concept, and a marketable one as well, in light of America's current infatuation with the Edifice Complex. Considering the author's scholarly credentials, SEX AND REAL ESTATE should have been a absorbing book. ""Should have"" is the pivotal phrase here. No question that Garber's body of knowledge is vast--she hops all over the map with only the most tenuous connection to her thesis. Maybe she merely was showing off how much smarter she is than the average reader. While I have no doubt but that this fact is true, the book still quickly descends into boring psychobabble. Anyone seeking enlightenment is bound to be disappointed."
3,I read it in my (too small and soon to be redone) bathtub,"Don't excoriate Garber for the title of this book; authors typically don't choose the title or write jacket copy. It is true that the book has little to do with sex. It should probably be titled ""Miscellaneous thoughts on American houses"". If you're about to buy, remodel, or sell a house, this book will make a nice comforting read in the tub. It is sort of like watching Jerry Springer or Oprah and realizing that there are plenty of people whose lives are even more messed up than one's own. Skip the book if you're not about to engage in a huge real estate transaction of some sort."
1,Dreadful,"After quickly exhausting the cultural significance of Jello-O boxes in her previous book, SYMPTOMS OF CULTURE, Marjorie Garber has now produced little more than a book for realtors. The result is banal and rather stupid--anything but revelatory. But perhaps the reader below doesn't take the criticism far enough: this book has really nothing to say about the scandalous cost of real estate in most major U.S. cities, the large number of people who are homeless, and the millions of folks who are gouged every month by unscrupulous landlords (how sexual is that, Professor Garber?). Until recently, cultural critics expressed nominal interest in improving our society. Nowadays, concerned only about their fat publishing advances, all they seem able to do is exhibit nauseating complicity with society's ugliest elements."
2,Black and Decker CHV7250 Wet Dry Vac.,"I received this item in a timely manner, but Im not as happy as I thought I would be. When using on sand in the windows it actually hits your skin and stings, thus its not being trapped inside the plastic container., therefore getting into the air and being breathed in. I also believe Im getting static shock. So, I would not recommend this, and I probably ahould have returned it. Kim C."
4,Just what I needed,"It was more than I expected. I got my money's worth out of it right away. The only thing that I don't like is the battery life is not that long. Other than that, a great buy."
1,"Useless, even for small spils","We live in a carpeted apartment, and we bought this vacuum because spills are inevitable, even if you're careful. Therefore, the idea of having a cordless wet/dry vacuum cleaner was quite appealing, as you could in principle vaccum spills at once. However, the B&D; Wet/Dry DustBuster proved to be quite useless for this purpose. The dust/water container fills up quite rapidly, becoming full with about 2 fl. oz. of liquid. When the container fills up with water (or wine, or whatever nasty stuff you're vacuuming), the liquid passes through the sponge filter, literally hitting the fan. The outcome: the nasty stuff you're vacuuming sprays in a thin mist all over the place (an you).Pros: portable, powerful, cordless.Cons: small dust/liquid container; bad design allows for overfilled liquids to be sprayed.Botton line: ok for small dust jobs; worse than useless for spills larger than 2 oz."
3,Works well for most jobs but requires maintenance,"This DustBuster has been very useful with a baby. Great to clean his high chair, get Cheerios and pieces of banana off the floor. Also very handy for getting spit-up off the rug.Clean up is not for the faint of heart, however. We learned you must clean it out EVERY DAY or bacteria will grow and the whole machine will emit an odor every time you clean. The machine is not easy to clean out either, which makes us less likely to do it often.The other drawback is that some liquids and fine dusts (like drywall) will actually come out through the vacuum exhaust, and emit a very fine spray everywhere. That's particularly disgusting with spit-up. Black & Decker should put a finer filter on it to prevent that."
2,dust in the face,"here's what's good: before the battery runs out, it does a good job of sucking things up.here's what's bad: if you tilt this at the wrong angle, you will get a face full of whatever it is your sucking up as it comes out the exhaust. this is disgusting. i can't stress how disgusting it is.and IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIESyou need to rule this dust buster out right here and now.or if you plan to use it to suck up cat litter, well ....the battery doesn't last as long as i'd like either."
2,Not for kitchen use,"I bought this with the intention of using it for cleanups around the kitchen and for sucking up leftover food in my 1yr old's high chair especially. While at first I thought it was great, after not emptying the contents right away (which is a pain because you have to remove the filter thingy that is dirty and gross) I found that they would get moldy very quickly and I would end up with a disgusting mess on my hands. Not to mention that it is VERY difficult to clean b/c it goes to a point where the food/debris gets caught and you have to find something that will reach in and clean it. Not the helpful tool that I thought it would be!Other than that it has good suction! I recommend plugging it in everytime you put it away so the battery stays charged."
1,Wet Vac NOT,We bought this wet/dry vac because we thought it would be handy to use on spills that occur on carpeting. This does not work at all on wet spills - just smears them around making a bigger mess. I would not recommend this product.
3,Not Great With Cat Hair,"I'm in a hurry so this is brief. Although the Dust Buster is pretty good in general, it's not great at doing what I REALLY need it to do...sucking up my 3 cats' hair that gets all over the couch within 10 minutes of vacuuming it."
1,"Waste of money, spend more on a vacuum that actually works!","This handvac is lightweight and easy to store, but it's not useful. The suction is adequate for picking up hairs, lint and dust....but not for anything with ANY weight. We stored it near the stairs (hardwood) to pickup dog/cat hair...if you ran it for more than 5 minutes, the power would begin to fizzle out. After a few months, the battery wouldn't hold a charge at all. I imagine it would not perform well on carpeting for even the hair/lint. We just bought a Black & Decker CHV1568 / 15.6 volt for about $50, and it is much more powerful. We have yet to see how the battery lasts, but I think the extra cost is worthwhile."
1,aka dust blower,This vac has the worst designed exhaust outlets ever. They blow air right into your face no matter how you hold it. Even bits of dirt blow into your face. Don't buy it!
2,"I love DustBusters, but not this one","Oh how I wish I could say this one was as great as the one it replaced (wore that sucker out). I have two small children so this is a necessity many times a day. It does pick up, but that's about the only positive.It shoots air up and back, and the air is from what it just picked up - watch your eyes. You must go forward so you do not blow what you are trying to pick up all over (does this make sense?). It seems there is no perfect angle (maybe if my arms were longer?!) that it does not hit you in the face. Wish I knew this when I used it for the first time on a broken lightbulb...shards of glass right in my face. And I do not recommend using this for wet spills unless you plan on washing it out afterwards - did not think about this when I happily cleaned up spilled cheerios and milk...two days later...blech.All of this aside, as long as I know how and what to use this for, it's useable - but not that great. Battery life is laughable."
3,7.2 wet/drydustbuster,"I bought this item from target last week...it is good and convenient to use...as this has an air outlet exhaust on the left side, the air hits your face sometimes and thats a problem... wet pick up I have not tried,, but I am sure it requires lot of cleaning filters/other stiff...after wet pick ups. Suction power is good and battery charge holds for around 7-8 mts.."
2,"worked for less than a year, too cheap","This vac had decent suction at first, but that didn't last long, now doesn't have any suction less than one year after purchase. So much for the 2 year warranty, they advised me to drive it to the nearest service center, hardly worth the time and gas. Not to mention it always blew out air and dust particles from the top every time I used it. Junk."
2,not-satisfied,This vacuum is good for very small particles that are on top or surface. After a few seconds of vacuuming the battery runs weak immediately.
4,So far so good....,"It is a great little buy. Great power and easy to reach wall-mounting included. Not to be cynical, but most of these hand-helds don't last long and stop charging so I am glad to have a powerful and versatile vacuum for a low price."
4,FAST SHIPPING & FREE!,"The dustbuster arrived very quickly and teh best part was that i had qualified for free shipping through amazon since this was an amazon direct sale. The dustbuster gets teh job done, although it does begin to lose suction after a few minutes of being fully charged. Apparently the batteries cannot stay charged longer than 10 minutes. If you must use it for larger jobs, i would recommed you purchase a higher voltage hand vaccum and definately keep it charged."
4,The battery does the job!,The battery is as advertised and was promptly delivered. This is our second or third purchase and they last and keep their charge as expected.
2,Disappointed,The print is horizontal rather than vertical and doesn't look nice if you want to wear it as a skirt type wrap. Fabric is nice but I'm really disappointed about the print.
3,I prefer the BoxWave Crystal Screen Protector . . .,". . . which is the version that's NOT labeled ""Anti-Glare."" This one has a slightly rough matte finish, which I suppose will cut down on glare if that's your main issue. However, touchscreen performance and clarity suffer. When using the BoxWave Nexus One ClearTouch *Crystal* Screen Protector, the display is as crisp and clear as your screen without a protector. With this one (BoxWave Nexus One ClearTouch *Anti-Glare* Screen Protector), everything is a bit muted, and icons don't respond as well to touch. On the plus side, this one cuts greasy fingerprints better than the Crystal version, if that's your main concern. Both will do a stellar job of protecting the underlying glass from scrape marks and other surface damage."
2,hard to type,This product actually made typing harder and made the screen less responsive and harder to read
1,Poor Quality,"The product fails in two important aspects: (1) as noted by others, the anti-glare matte finish distorts the beautiful AMOLED display of the N1, and (2) I noticed that some of the edges started to lift after less than a week. Application is easy, and it has fulfilled its main purpose (protecting the screen) as far as I can tell, but the two weaknesses I noted are enough to conclude that this is a poor product that I will probably replace with a different screen protector.Update: I switched to a Clarivue (""ultra clear"") screen protector, and it's much better -- no bubbles, fits perfectly, does not ruin the vividness of the N1 display. They also have an anti-glare one that I can't vouch for, but it may be a good alternative to those who are adamant about having anti-glare finish."
1,Fails on one vital aspect,"This is a quality product in most respects. Packaging is good, it comes with an applicator card (because nobody has a small piece of plastic) and a little cleaning cloth, which is great. Application was easy but shows a tiny flaw - the thing isn't the exact size as the Nexus One screen. Yeah, it covers the entire touch area but you'll be leaving a small border on the side(s).The screen protector's surface is somewhat rough, which apparently helps prevent glare and feels kinda nice.Sadly, it also prevents solid colours form being solid. They all appear to have diffused pixels on them, kind of like spraying a fine mist on the phone (I wish I could attach a photo).This screen protector makes the Nexus One's beautiful, beautiful screen appear utterly terrible."
5,Great truck for your Gator fan!,"If you are thinking about getting it, just do it! We bought it 2 years ago & it is durable & cool!"
4,Only really worth the bonuses on vanilla,Only bought it for the extra unlocks. Game itself imo isn't really worth playing. Adds some novelty items. But nothing really worth playing the game for. Can be found cheap and gives you an extra unlock for each class so definitely worth it just for that.
3,The only review for 2008?,"Most of the install issues are from old posts. To install BF2 SF, first make sure you have patch 1.41 full install handy (download it first if you do not). Install BF2 SF, but DO NOT RUN IT. Then, run the patch. Then, once the patch is complete, you can run BF2 SF from the desktop BF2 SF shortcut, play one round to get the unlocks. The unlocks automatically follow with your account, so when you load up BF2 (non-SF), you'll still have your unlocks."
4,Great Game,"I found out it best to install bf2 ,then special forces then patch.That way you don't have to reinstall bf2.It has some sweet rides to go with it. I like using the quads and doing some sweet jumps."
2,Buggier than the original,"Believe it or not, Special Forces is in worse shape than Battlefield 2 was when it was released.EA and Dice have been slow to address showstopping bugs in the original game, and against my better judgement, I decided to give SF a shot thinking that maybe some problems would have been addressed.Nope.Many people are experiencing a lot of difficulty just INSTALLING the game, let alone playing it. If you are able to get the game installed (and I eventually was), you're likely to find yourself up against a host of other problems including severe frame-rate drops and performance issues, even if the original game ran well performanse-wise (which mine did).It would be nice if companies like EA and Dice were held more accountable for shoddy product they release to their fans, especially considering that the majority of their fanbase consists of financially-strapped college and high-school students.This is awful."
1,Don't take a chance,"This game is very buggy. You may or may not be able to play it due to serious errors due to memory management. Patches routinely fail requiring a complete uninstall or manual uninstall with a registry edit. It took me 20+ hours of tweaking to get the patches to work and after patching I got a memory.dll sanity check error (no I'm not kidding, google it) and it still will not work. The thing that really gets me is that my system FAR exceeds the minimum requirement, in fact it exceeds the recommended requirements and my video card is spicifically named as supported."
5,My son's game,My son loves this game! Thank you for your prompt service. As always the delivery of your products has been sooner than expected and in excellent condition. Thank you!sue :)
2,This game really stinks,"This game refuses to load! I sat at the optimizing shaders screen for over an hour with no results. Most of the time it stops loading at 62%, other times it even stops at 15%. EA won't reply to my emails at technical support.It's too bad, cause I run some pretty nice machinery, too.Furthermore, even if I could play it, I probably wouldn't want to, since the subject of the game is pretty stupid. Instead of all-out war, it's covert operations. Better to just buy the Rainbow Six franchise for that. At least they do a better job at game design."
5,A blast,"Night vision, crossbows with zip lines, smoke, rope climbing - what the heck is not to like about this. A great time. Much better than the base Battlefield 2 game."
3,Good game if you can play it,"I've been a of the battlefield series since the BF:1942 wake island demo came out. I've played BF2 since it came out pretty constinetly playing several hours a day during the summer. I saw many nasty bugs that put a major bump in gaming. Server browser didn't work,random crashes,hard to install patches, exploiters.I still however love the bf2 series of games as they are very fun and encourage team work. Vehicles are a blast as many fps don't even have vehicles.I installed this game today right after receiving it in hopes of playing. Turns out as I read the forums that the account server is offline and I can't play online. Maybe I'll try out the single player :(."
1,STAY AWAY,"What kind of crap is this. EA's developers are too F*ck!ng stupid to create an installer that can utilize any drive. Instead it only looks to your C drive and will not allow you to install the game/patches if there is not atleast 3Gigs there. I have over 400Gig free space on my system spread across multiple partitions but its not in the system partition so I can't install this game I just puchased. EA, Digital Illusions.... YOU SUCK, why don't you go to the local high schools and find some real programmers.If you are even contemplating this game make sure you have the required disk space on your C drive for install, this is above and beyond the actual install of the game and not necessarily where you installed Battlefield 2 or where you will install the expansion.I'm sure the game itself is fun if you EVER get to play it, as for myself I will be returning the game to my local EB store tomorrow and writting an equally if not harsher Email to EB support."
3,Too bad EA don't care about campaign players,"This is a great addition to the battlefield family, only problem is finding a server without 8 yr old dee dee dee's is almost impossible. EA has made an error with this family by making offline play so un-rewarding, you can't even play all the maps that are available offline."
4,Multi-play is fun some of the time,"Multi-player online works great, but the level of fun is determined by:1) The skill of the player2) The teamwork of your co-playersIt would be great if there were different servers for different skill levels. I'm not that good, and I get wasted whenever I play because there are usually players who have devoted their entire lives to this game killing me left and right."
4,BF2 Player,I bought this add on as soon as it came out. I was happy with the new content and maps. I was also suprised to see that some of the weapons carried back into the original BF2 like the flashbangs for instance. The only problems after installation I had were having to reinstall the 1.12 patch after my SF installation. I had performance issues the original game but cleared all those when I added a second gig of ram.
1,Just a Skin,"Dont waste your money! This game is just collection of skins. The maps are exactly the same only with rearranged buildings. I bought this around christmas and have played it probably 5 times total. The characters look pretty cool, but ultimately the gameplay has not changed for the better at all. This is just a gimmick pulled by EA and DICE to pump you for cash. The only real change in the gameplay is the incorporation of night maps. You are given night vision as well as a few other nifty trinkets that you seldomly use.Take my advice and don't waste your hard earned cash on a pointless scam to get more money for more nothing."
1,Like it but hate the bugs and lack of support,"I am still playing the game, but with this add-on now during game play I can expect my PC to crash more, extreme lag, and my personel favorite being kick off a server after joining a battle for 5-10 secs into the game for any reason though not the correct one.The game is overprice and the tech support is horrible (They ignore you). To only way to get the bugs fix is to speak to a game guro who know how to tinker with the source code.To download a 3 gig file in order to get the game to work is ridculous!"
2,very short battery life!,battery lasted about 1hr in the beginning but it died a few months after purchase. not worth buying
4,old but still a collector item,this is a really old toy used by the power rangers in power rangers zeo.this is a really old toy and i can say is that the old toys are way better than these new ones especially since dino thunder screwed america over.i still have this toy and all the other zeo zords but this price is way too xpensive even if its only 3 to 7 years old.200 dollars for this old guy hes fun and all almost identical to the japanese one just the sword isnt siver.i dont even know if kids will even knwo what this guy can do unless they watch the old series to play with its full potential.u will also need the red battlezord in order to create the zeo battlezord.overall if u watch ppower rangers zeo u will know that having this toy would make it more better to understand how to actually know what it can really do.
5,A Great DVD,I'm a belly dance instructor and this is the DVD I recommend to my students. Some people are visual learners and need something during the week to practice with in between classes. This DVD is perfect and covers every movement in my beginner class. Lana breaks down everything well and also emphasizes posture! So important! It also makes a good practice companion for dancers past the beginner stage.
3,Mickey meets Ebenezer Scrooge story,I didn't realize the basis of this story which is for older kids except Disney is often for younger kids. It has scary ghosts and a moral that's hard to understand.
5,If A Man Answers,I grew up with Sandra Dee films airing on television in 1970s and IF A MAN ANSWERS is one of my all time favorites. Sandra Dee plays a newly married woman to a photographer who feels taken for granted by her husband. Her mother has the perfect self help book for her titled HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DOG. When the husband learns of this it's time for step two. An imaginary lover to call you. If a man answers..hang up.
3,More Dee/Darin 1960's froth to make you smile.,"Though it doesn't quite deliver the polished, sophisticated fun of ""That Funny Feeling"", I still enjoyed the good-natured silliness of ""If a Man Answers"". Dee is radiant, Darin is effectively exasperated, and that title song is really catchy. No real extras (just a slightly ragged trailer), but the DVD print of the film is bright, sharp, and clear. And for the low price, what more can one ask?"
5,Timeless Movie,Every Woman should watch this movie.The story applies for any generation.What makes a good woman? One who will do what she can to keep her man. Anything.Even if it seems simple and crazy. Men are gifts when they show up to be with us crazy women.This movie puts it all into perspective... With Sandra Dee at the helm.. this is great story telling.
5,Sparkling Comedy,"Gorgeous Sandra Dee and Bobby Darin classic. Sparkles with sophistication and beauty. The sets, the location and the wardrobe are perfection. If only things were as lovely now. The supporting cast is flawless as well, especially the wonderful Micheline Presle. Sandra never looked so stunning. Everyone should watch this to see what beauty and talent really look like."
5,If a Man Answers,This was one of the cutest movies I have seen in a long time. Sandra Dee and Bobby Darin were so cute in this. They don't make movies like they use to. Bobby Darin was wonderful.
3,Dee and Darin Make It Work,"This is a cute farce but I found the story plodding at times. Dee and Darin make the entire thing work. They're funny, adorable and make a cute couple.The story itself is off balance. I couldn't identify with any of the characters.It was nice to see Dee as a domestic wife who knew how to cook!! She didn't in real life. And its kind of sad to watch her as well knowing that she battled anorexia all her life. If it is true that the camera adds ten pounds then Dee was rail thin because she's nothing but skin and bones in this feature, although still beautiful and charming.Darin does well by his role and he's too charming not to be loveable.The movie is worth a look but it won't be among my favorites. I much prefer Dee and Darin in ""That Funny Feeling"" instead.Dee and Darin get 5 stars. The movie only gets 3."
5,Great fun movie,This has always been a favorite and I sent it to my daughter in law to watch and she loved it!
5,Interesting application of Anomie theory,"This was a textbook in my university criminology class, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It applies the theory of anomic strain to the United States as a whole and proposes that it is the cause for crime and deviance. Many of the ideas and themes presented in it ring true with sentiments of Americans today, with the gap between the upper and lower class growing larger and larger."
5,How True It Is,"I was privileged to have Dr. Rosenfeld as a professor while majoring in criminology. I found his course and his research fascinating. This book is very well written and an interesting theory. Having recently become a public defender representing indigents charged with felony offenses, Dr. Rosenfeld's theory is right on the mark. American crime is a serious problem, with its roots deep in american culture and expectations. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding the true roots of american crime."
2,Same old content in a new box,"""Crime and the American Dream"" is a retread of the same old ""Blame America First"" argument that prevails in academia. No country on the planet has opportunities for upward mobility as those that exist in the USA. Envy, the desire for shortcuts and a ""something for nothing"" sense of entitlement did not originate in 1776. We have redefined poverty such that expensive sneakers, cell phones, and large screen TV's are seen as necessities. Want to see poverty that might actually drive people to crime, then visit Manila, Mexico City. or Bogota. Our worst slums would be luxury for millions."
5,Candles in My Window,"This is a great book esp. if you are Jewish. I recomend it to anyone who wants a simple to read but page turning book. It is a story about a girl that is determined to learn about her religion and in that determination she opens her religion to her whole family. It is a great book, I know tons of people who love it."
4,Informative Book,"I really enjoyed reading this book about Hilary. It gave a lot of information and detailed stuff about her life as a teen star. I also enjoyed the fact it has Hilary information and quizzes. I think that made it a better experience when reading. I admire Hilary and even her sister Haylie. I think they're both very talented. The only thing I did not like about this book was the cheap paper. Other than that, very interesting book, with a few colored photos."
4,Pretty Good,The reson i got this book was because my friend got to meet Hilary Duff and I wanted something for her autograph. My mom was out and bought me this for her to sign. I read it after they got back. It was good. It contained lots of facts even her favourite lip gloss and all the movies she has and will be in that shes filming and a lot more. At the back there is a quiz which i scored really well at! This is a cool book!
5,Not-So-Typical Book!!!,"This book/biography is amazing. From the young Hilary to the teen sensation! The author's way of writing this book is incredible and I got all the info on Hilary! I loved the facts and quiz at the end of the book and the pictures are remarkable!In other words, I totally loved this book!"
4,Ordinary but enjoyable,"I found Lewis's book very ordinary in terms of its theme but still enjoyable. I liked her writing because it was simple and easy to understand. Her narrative is not one of those that require the reader to exert themselves to understand everything fully. It's a story of two sisters, a mother and her two children, her relationship with a mysterious guy, and her relationship with her ex-husband. It's funny at times and a good read."
5,If you like Anne Lamott's non-fiction read on,"I loved this book. But, I've loved ALL Sara Lewis' books. She writes with heart and kindness and wit. Her characters are true and funny and real. Sure, they are experiencing a lot of the same kinds of problems you and I are, but reading about their lives sheds light on my own. Oh, and also I'm entertained!It is a wonderful thing to be able to read a book about people who want to ""get it right"". People who aren't out to maim and mutilate each other. People who might have had a few bumps in the road of life but manage to pick themselves up, dust themselves off, and fall in love again, both with a new mate, as well as with the experience of being alive."
2,Lackluster,"This book was very easy to read and moved along quickly but it was by no means ""good."" The plot was sometimes boring and sometimes just silly and the writing was banal. Although it was a fast read, there are hundreds of other books out there that are a fast read and capitivating. Reading this book was a waste of my time."
5,Know what your watching!,"Here's another example of an excellent DVD on the subject of UFO's that can confuse a newbie to the subject.Why? Example: ""The Chiles-Whitted Case"", in this DVD this particular case is told accurately but the animation is inaccurate! This was disappointing. But you get the point of the story. The DVD is excellent as it takes you on an almost 2 hour ride through the history of UFOs. It's an excellent addition to any collection. I think. If you are new to the subject of UFOs check out UFOevidence.org. Then go back and compare stories in this or any other DVD on this subject. Then you decide whether or not we're being visited. Or are they just setting us up for an eventual take over?"
5,Fits my Craftsman lawn tractor perfectly!,"I wanted to post a review to let folks know that this is an exact OEM replacement for the oil filter that came with my Sears lawn tractor, and that this exact same oil filter costs 30% more if you by it from Sears. However Amazon would not let me say this in a review unless I said something about the product itself. So I will say that it does the job and filters the oil like it is supposed to. The engine oil runs through this filter removing impurities that may damage your engine. Change your filter according to the engine manufacturer's recommendation."
5,Great price great service.,This item was bought for a lawn tractor. It is the same exact item that they sell for twice the amount in there store. Fit perfect and will be great i'm sure.
3,Oil filter,"You really need to read a review, ok I wrote a review. It is a filter for oil on a yard toy. Works."
3,A Tenor? I Don't Think So...,"First of all I gave three stars just because I like the material on the disk and Tynan's diction. That's as good as it gets. Roanan is a fine singer. But Michael Crawford is more of a tenor than he is. And there is no comparison to Bocelli, Watson, & Amante (all whom I do not classify as operaetic tenors with exception to the powerful Watson). Tynan lacks a ringing top. Meaning he loses considerable weight in his voice in the upper register. The Irish Tenor Concerts (a clear knock-off of the real 3 Tenors) are nice but their voices truely can not match even the most lightest lyrical operaetic tenor voices (Vargas, Alvarez etc.). Just listen to the last note on Tynan's opening song, ""My Life Belong's To You"". Very very weak indeed. I'll stick with Crawford, Bocelli, Watson and Amante in this class of ""tenors"". But I'll take Carreras, Pavarotti, Cura, & Vargas any day of the week over all of them."
3,Disappointed,"If you already own ""Ronan Tynan""(put out by The Beautiful Music Company), you will be very disappointed when you receive ""My Life Belongs to You"" as the song list is exactly the same, except for one additional song (God Bless America). Ironically, the songs are in exactly the same order as the ""Ronan Tynan"" cd.As much as I enjoy Ronan Tynan and other Irish Tenors cd's, I should have closely reviewed what I was getting before making this purchase."
3,case,It arrived fairly quickly but the case was broken on one of the taps and the face was cracked. The cd inside was fine
1,Topper 1 & 2,Topper 1 & 2 has very poor quality. It looks like it never has been restored. If you like the Topper series buy THE ADVENTURES OF TOPPER for $ 3.99. It has 9 episodes and they are very good.
2,Topper 1 & 2,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. The quality was very bad & very hard to watch. I tried to contact the sellers, but received no response."
2,Topper,"I did get this movie on time, but the picture and audio quality were poor.I donated it to my local Goodwill."
1,Not Satisfied,Volume 1 of the set wouldn't play at all. Volume 2 begins with a poor picture but clears up after a short time.
5,Memoirs of an Insignificant Dragon,"What wonderful book, written with humor, insight and wonderful descriptions of life in Vietnam. My eyes have been opened to a new culture. It is so easy to forget that the people of Vietnam - before and after the Vietnam War - are just that...people. And this book brings a new awareness to life on the continent of Southeast Asia. I highly recommend this book, for its easy reading style and very entertaining discriptions."
5,heart and soul,"Marjorie Doughty has written a book with heart and soul. Her memoirs are not so much the accounts of battles and bodies, they are the insight of a woman ""from a rather unusual perspective"". I recommend this book even to soldiers who have served in Vietnam to see the ""other side""."
1,Spend the extra on a real snowblower,"I have used this snow thrower for two seasons now. The first season was ok. After that, getting it to start with the pull cord was AWFUL. I used more energy trying to get it to start for 20 minutes than I would shoveling my 20x30 driveway. And in this past storm with some slush, the engine seized because it worked so ""hard"". The manual shute adjust is also a pain. My advice: spend the extra $200 and get a real snow blower."
2,Lasted less than one year,"3/08 - 01/09 This Powerlite lasted less then one year. Was used only about 10 times. The motor just fried. I did not use the perfect blend of gas/oil mix apparently so the warranty would not cover. I owned a prior Toro that was 19 years old before it went out and replaced it with this one.Did a decent job with up to 4 inches of snow. Anything more and you had to take it slow or the engine would bog down. Stinky machine. My wife complained that my jacket smelled after I cleaned the drive. That's from the 2 cycle gas/oil mix. Even new, it took several pulls to get it to start. Had to resort to starter fluid to get it to start. This is what the dealer told me to do! $360 down the drain after 10 months.I went and bought a Craftsman for $100 more with twice the power, 4 stage and electric start. So far so good."
4,Great for budget or weight conscience buyer,"I looked at MTD brand (Cub Cadet, Troy-Bilt, Yard-Man, YardMachines, Bolens, McCulloch and White Outdoor) blowers and throwers. I have used John Deere and can't begin to tell you what a pain it is to push that big heavy thrower around, or what pains it caused later. Yes this Toro is narrow requiring more passes but using it doesn't' even seem like work so it doesn't really matter. For the price you can get into a low end MTD thrower but after asking the repair shop what they would buy of the two they said Toro because they are easy to repair and therefore cost less to repair. That makes sense because if I want to use a wider machine I can always use my old Toro. My old Toro is 27 years old but they still make parts for it. The only problem with that one is it uses too much gas."
1,Warranty problems,"I bought this machine with an electric start. The prong from the electric start come out with the plug and the company would not honor the warranty.They told me that this can happen in cold weather[ I haven't had the need to start it in the warm weather} and the dealer can decide if he wants to cover the warranty. I would never buy another toro product. I had one for 12 years and it was great, but this one is a piece of junk. I agree with the other reviewers that it is hard to start. The company is going down hill and their warranty is a useless piece of paper!"
1,Don't be fooled!,"Although this appears to be a new book by Florence Farr. This book, The Legend of Ra and Isis, is in fact a chapter from Florence Farr's book _Egyptian Magic_. It is unfortunate that Kessinger Publishing or Amazon.com have not indicated that this is just a reprint of a chapter."
3,Who Goes There Review,Anxious to read about The Thing. Haven`t started yet. But that should be a good bedtime story. We will see.
5,Meets my expectations!,"Britannica Concise Encyclopedia is up to the standard! Great, quality book. Strong binding, plenty of information in it. My kids are always asking why and what, so I point them to this book all the time."
4,An on-the-mark guide for any start-up.,This book really does answer all the questions. I've seen too many entrepreneurs make the same mistakes too often. A once over lightly and an in depth read of this book will enlighten anyone contemplating their own business. Mike Baird has provided a thorough analysis of the steps you need to take - things your accountant and attorney may not even be aware of! This is simply an indispensible tool for any start-up venture.
1,Not Lean and Very Outdated,"Months ago, before I knew any better, I would have rated this 5 stars. But ever since getting into Lean Methodology and all the requirements for making a lean Startup, I realize that this book only worked in the era of slow moving and giant companies. Nowadays, you have to be customer-focused and agile to hang with the big players. This book makes you take on too much waste early on. For a beginner, I suggest you start with something like the Four Steps to Epiphany, and other books and blogs recommended by Steve Blank and Eric Ries. You might still want to read this to compare and contrast like a before and after, but seriously, this book belongs in a museum.P.S. Some of the Legal advice is spot on though"
4,"Very useful, understandable material for important topics","I found the book to be one of the most readable and clear out of the dozen or so books that I have read on Hi-tech startup. Since it was written in 1992, I would really like to see a revised edition. Much has changed in those years! The business principles probably have not, but the market and technologies have."
4,Right on Target,"It was refreshing and rewarding to get this book that is really oriented to the ""High-Tech Entrepreneur"" as stated in the title and not just a ""warmed over"" general ""How To Start a Business"" book.I found great information in every chapter."
3,"quick reading - usefull, but not great","all in all, a fine book. not great, as it misses many important fund raising points. from a pragmatic approach/operative approach it is not bad."
1,Kindle version,Don not buy this book in Kindle. It is not possible to read or see the pictures nor graphs.It is a shame that Amazon allows such a low quality. The price difference between the print anddigital version already caught my eye but unfortenately I bought it anyway.
1,Router and bits,"This item is rubbish and the bits are crap also. The shaft on each bit is much smaller than 1/4"", so I am unable to use them with this machine.I bought this item to use on small diy jobs, I've used it once since I bought it. I took it out of the box to use it for the second time this past week, installed the bit and started routing the edges of what I am working on, after about 2 minutes, it started making strange noises ang getting hot. On close inspection, I notices that the plastic part of the router body has a lot of cracks and the screws that hold it together were falling out. The construction of this item matches the price. It is a pile of junk."
4,Yet another collection of early Elvis,"This is yet another collection of early Elvis recordings and performances. The copyrights for recorded material only lasts for 50 years in Europe, so many of Elvis early recordings have become ""public domain"" in Europe, meaning that any record company can make copies of them and release them. This has led to a plethora of releases like this. It includes many of his historic Sun recordings and some live performances. It is a nice collection if you do not already own these songs."
2,"A ""brief"" life indeed...","Although the book is clearly written and set up in a very reader friendly way, it is too brief. Since Renate Bethge is/was Bonhoeffer's niece the book is very trustworthy and gives good insight. However, the book's 86 pages of text could no doubt be shortened to 25 pages merely by lessening the margin space. The format of the book would fit poetry better than a biography. A slow reader, like the the writer of this review, can read the book in 1hr 20 min. The reason I bought this book was because I didn't know much about Bonhoeffer and thought this book, being under 100 pages might be more fitting than an 800 page book. I was disapointed to find there was little in this book which I did not know already.What information this book gives, one can find on the internet for free.If I had a 12 year old son that I wanted to give a constructive reading, this book would be perfect. For an adult that is seeking something more substantial, this is not the pick."
1,Obsolete product - Do not buy it.,I bought this product for my niece. This is for a beginnerwho just start learning english. I can't access the InternetLessons category from the CDs because all the files are nolonger existed and can't get help from technical supporteither since this is an obsolete product. Technical supportis terrible and such a waste of time - You are on your ownwith your problem!
3,About this program,"This program works on my computer properly although I have Windows XP. My problem was that I couldn't locate more advanced lessons on these disks, so I stuck with the easy ones although I bought this program to improve my English, not to learn it from the very beginning.When this program tested my English, it said that I don't need to take general lessons, and that was all it said. It didn't take me or show me where the advanced level is. I think there is no advanced level in this program.So, that is why I am not satisfied with this program."
1,Don't buy this for Windows XP,"I was very excited when I purchased this software package for my wife - as was she - since we had heard such good things about it. But there is a bug that crashes the program on Windows XP. When we called tech support, we were told that this is a ""known problem"". Unfortunately, there is no fix for it yet. So we are stuck with a program that we cannot return."
2,"Does not run on Windows XP, no shipping outside the US","For one of the two reasons above this software will not serve most people. Since XP is the latest OS and most ELS students are abroad, these are major weaknesses. Look elsewhere. Don't trust a product that fails on the basics. Even if you don't have XP and do not live abroad."
2,Not impressed - not for kids,"One thing I did not like at all with this product is that when it teaches beverages, it focuses on beer and coffee (or wine). Why not teach juice or even soda? Anyways, in the introductory lessons you see adults at the bar and drinking beer and when they ask about drinking, it's ""wine"" or ""beer"" or ""coffee"". -- they should not advertise for 12 and up with so much reference to drinking alcohol.Another thing is that it introduces a few phrases/words for vocabulary that are not common. For example: ""scorcher"" -- who says that?Anyways, I do like the bird that teaches grammar -- he is entertaining, but he's only in the introductory lessons thus far, it seems.I use this program to tutor an ESL student in English. I would tell someone else to NOT get it."
3,No Cable Included,The drain cleaner came with out cable snake. The snake appeared in the discription. There were no comments regarding a separate choice for the cable. Was it part of the package?Carl hauck
2,FALLS SHORT OF THE PROMISE OF THE TITLE,"Unfortunately this book falls short of the promise of its' title. I ordered this book hoping for practical information about creating a funeral service for my mother-in-law, for whom we were providing hospice care in our home.Disappointingly this book did not inspire my creative process. The material was dry and read like a research paper. If I'd been writing a class paper, it would have been a good resource, but its' helpfulness in creating a ceremoney was nil. The use of the ""mourning needs"" list, as an organzing force for the different elements of a ceremony stifled creative process. This book would have been more useful if it had included actual ideas and resources for readings, music, eulogies and perhaps outlines of what other people have put together."
4,Quite Helpful,"This book has gotten me through some confusing situations in the game. My feeling of accomplishment doesn't come from figuring out how to do something - it comes from actually being able to do it! One of the frustrations I have is that the guide is written so that it's not specific to a system, so you have to know the generic names of the control buttons. This is not a criticism of the product, just a fact when a game can be played on different delivery systems. I would like some of the pictures to be larger and clearer - I need the visual aids to help me along. Overall, without this book, I would have been stuck early in the game and stopped playing."
3,Ravel,Excellent choice of selections. Grimaud is competent but not exceptional. The quality of sound and recording are poor. It is worth purchasing.
4,The rite to an opinion,"While I understand that everyone is entitled to their own viewa and opinions, I don't understand how anyone can think this set overrated. This set is superbly recorded, giving the SFSO all the support they deserve. I saw MTT and the SFSO play the rite live at the BBC Proms last year, which was also recorded and shown on TV. At the present time, it is only that live recording that I have on video which surpasses this rite, even considering all the fabulous recordings available, including Boulez and both of Stravinsky's own. MTT, as usual brings out the best in the players of the SFSO, which are continuously adding to their collection of top rate recordings (my other recommendation is of Berlioz' Symphonie Fantastique plus excerpts from Lelio - same artists)."
2,Three months later-vastly overrated.,"I have to comment on an earlier review of mine in which I called Perséphone is absolutely beautiful; it isn't, and not even Stephanie Cosserat's voice can save it after even a relatively short period of time. It's just not a very good story and not only does she not save it, neither do Stavinsky, Gide, Michael Tilson Tilson Thomas, or anyone else involved. I do not know why this set won a Grammy. I don't play it anymore. I have an absolutely better L'Oiseau de Feu (Valery Gergiev's and the Kirov's) which is the only one that I have that I play and a couple of Sacre du Printemps' (Leonard Berstein's and Igor Stavinsky's), of which I just like Berstein's a lot better than Stavinsky's for which reason that is the only one I play. That's just my opinion. You might check out Gergiev's L'Oiseau du Feu and Berstein's Sacre ( on this site) if you're interested in those rather that this whole set."
4,Back to buy one for the second time,"This is the second time we have chosen to buy the hover disc. Like a giant, flat mylar balloon, they are delicate and not a great idea for young children prone to destroying things... However, we owned one for about 6 months and would inflate w/ a straw for fun around the house. They don't last forever, but my kids liked it so much they asked for another one this year for Christmas. Since these are relatively unusual to find at a toy store, this will be a welcome gift. Note: Once inflated they are relatively large and do not fold easily for storage, so you have to have room!"
5,this was a gift for my granddaughter,"the tea tin is cute,but I thought it would have been a little bigger,but my grand daughter who is 3,enjoys playing with it"
5,Adorable!,"Absolutely LOVE this tea set! My daughter loves me to make her herbal tea, so I thought this would be a fun addition to her kitchen. The details make this so cute! From the little ridge at the bottom of the tea bag to the engraving on the little green labels, this is just so dang cute! Now my girls have tea for their tea parties!"
5,"Very cute, but expensive!","Bought this for my granddaughters for their ""kitchen set"". It is VERY cute. They were sooo excited to open it up and see tiny little ""tea bags"". They ARE very cute! But a warning: they are VERY small! It comes with 4 ""teabags""; they are wooden-which is very nice (indestructable); they are in a tin-cute little tin; the tin is about 2"" x 1.5"" x 1.5"" and the ""teabags"" are about 1"" x 1/4"" or so. Just a very rough estimate. I was shocked when I opened my ""VHS sized"" box from Amazon to find this tiny little tin of ""teabags"" for the price! Not sure they're worth that! But the girls do love them!"
1,No HEA here,"While I do understand that the Civil War was very brutal and that a large number of men and women died and lived terribly through that time period, the last thing I wanted to do was settle in for a historical romance, and miss the romance. There was very little to none- just a lot of raping, killing, cowardice and dying.The main female character was portrayed as a young girl who's ideals and dreams all go up in smoke, but at some point it just seems like she'd get her head together and stop running off to her off-and-on-again fiancee (who happens to be partially responsible for her father's loss of eyesight and eventually his death.)Oh, and the fact that she fell in love with her second captor would be great and all.... if they actually had something besides anger and a lot of lust.I just went into the book expecting a lot more out of it (I don't mean word wise- it was quite longwinded) and came away disappointed."
2,Irritating...,"I tried several times to get into this book but about two thirds of the way through it I had to throw in the towel. I guess I can't really give it a fair review because I couldn't even finish it. My mom, you mom and Thumpers momma were all right...""if ya can't say somethin' nice, don't say anythin' at all"". The end."
4,This was a good book,"It was educational,and also romantic. I would give it 5stars but there was some grammar problems and I had a hard time reading through the details of the war."
2,Drawn out and disturbing,"The novel contains many graphic rape scenes. While I have no doubt this occurred frequently during the Civil War, it is not the stuff of romance. Also the plot was incredibly drawn out and the characters not altogether likeable. I read the brief description of what the sequel to this novel was and it is only more drama, and more rape. No thank you."
1,Love and War,"Terrible book. Usually enjoy reading Civil War novels but this one had too much violence. I know that this war was an awful one, but don't enjoy reading about all the violence against the women at this time. Not sure if I will read another book by this author."
4,Friend recommended to me,"A friend of mine recommended this to me but I have yet to see it. But since she has great taste in movies, I am sure I will enjoy it."
4,Wow...is all I have to say,"I will say that the t.v. show is very well put together and there are great actors/actresses. A majority of the show is accurate, but I couldn't see officer wives and enlisted wives hanging out at the bar, LOL! Just doesn't happen, around here anyways. There are some parts that seemed far fetched but others right on the dot.Army Wife-Robin"
4,Great Drama!,I always wondered how this show sucked people in. After watching the first season I understand why. So much happens in the fiest season. It's kind of like a grow ups 90210
5,Army Wives is one of the best shows I seen in a long time.,"I've been a big fan of Catherine Bell for a long time and seeing her in a roll where she's sexy, smart, funny, dramatic, and beautiful is great in fact so are all the other women on the show. The show itself shows what the families of Military personel go through on a daly basis. Army Wives is one of the best shows I seen in a long time."
3,Wishing it was a family movie!,Army Wives would have got a 5 star rating from me if it was a family movie. There is so much that even the kids could have learned and enjoyed (besides sex ed!!!). Call me old fashioned but it would have been Excellent if they had left out some of the details of the 'romance' scenes. There is not enough family movies any more.
1,Scratched disc,"The first disc in season one is scratched and stops atleast a dozen times and will not play. I am really upset with this due to the fact i payed alot of money for shipping and a ""brand new"" dvd, and there is also wear inside and on the top right hand corner of the dvd."
2,One DVD was severely scratched,DVD was new and one of the DVDS was severely scratched. I had to return which was no problem.
1,OK- Now we are completely out of good ideas,I lasted about 18 minutes. This piece of melodramatic tripe actually seems to try to glorify military life and the fools who get suckered into it. What do they not get about the fact that the military is for goons and losers who are unable to think for themselves? What if they gave a war and no one was stupid enough to go?
5,"""ARMY WIVES"" IS OF GOOD CHARACTER","""Army Wives"" is the best series that I've seen since ""JAG"". As with ""JAG"", character development carries the series. The viewer is invited into both the main characters' domestic and professional lives, into their hopes and their problems. Viewers go to home and to work with the characters. And, the characters are interesting and their actions are not always predictable. The chemistry is good too. It's spiced right; there's enough diversity and conflict between characters to maintain suspense. This is in contrast to ""NCIS"", which fails to hold my interest. Character development on ""NCIS"" is shallow; a tatoo or an unusual hairstyle is as far as it goes. The viewer isn't invited to share the characters' personal lives with ""NCIS"" in the way the viewer is with ""Army Wives"" or with ""JAG"". However, the viewer is invested in the lives of the ""Army Wives"" and their families and eagerly awaits the next installment."
5,Amazing Book By the Greatest!,"I bought this book when I was doing Saddle seat training with my TWH. Although most of the book is for non-TWH riders, there is still an amazing amount of reading in here to put it down.I loved every minute of it!"
1,don't buy this book,"I agree with the previous review. This book was not worth the money--in fact I returned it, and I hardly ever return a book. The title implies to me, at least, that there are tests in the book you can take, and then you can match the results to various careers. The test consist of psychological questions, and after you finish taking them, evidenly you are suppose to figure them out, with no guidance. It doesn't even give the HINT of what careers you may be suited for--there is NOTHING about careers in this book. An extremely misleading title."
5,"A sad tale of genius, robbed by Melrose","I've read a good bit about Morton, how he was a ""braggart"" and a story-teller. Indeed, he was a story-teller but once you read this book, telling how Jelly was robbed by his music publishers as well as his on again/off again wife, you'll have a greater and deeper appreciation of the artist known as Jelly Roll Morton.A wonderful read, a sad story and thank goodness all the papers were found in that apartment/home in New Orleans less Morton end up no more or no less respected than his former reputation.The inventor of jazz? Pretty darned close.Now, if someone would only release the COMPLETE Lomax LOC recordings - that would be something! Mosaic, where are you when we need you?"
4,A sad tale of injustice,"The editorial reviews rightly praise this wonderful investigative piece based on a strong archive of Jelly Roll materials. The latter half of Jelly Roll's story is a tragedy and even worse, one that has not really been redressed as two charges are quite clear: (1) ASCAP and two of Morton's publishers still owe considerable sums to his estate that has never been paid and (2) Morton's last will was signed under duress and his wife and sisters and their heirs are still not receiving the sizeable amounts due them even this many years later. Meanwhile individuals that Morton either never knew or violently detested, some of them rather racist, have profited greatly. One only hopes that someday this will be set right and at least some justice served, even if too late for Morton's own life."
5,Hope for Hard Times,"Someone loaned me a copy of Prayers from the Darkness, and I have gotten so much out of it, I'm buying my own + some for friends. Fraser manages to give new life and hope through her reading of the difficult Psalms. The book has a very personal feeling because of the stories about people who shared their hard times with Fraser and how a difficult Psalm helped them. They are true saints of God. This book offers hope for our hard times, whether they're physical, emotional, or spiritual."
1,THIS IS A SHAM,"The one I bought definitely doesn't work. I may have bought a used one, because it was not in the manufacturers box and contained no description, nor instructions. But if I did, the seller conned me by selling a device he knew didn't work. Why else would he sell it?"
1,Invest Elsewhere,"If you have privacy manager available through your local phone company...get that instead. It is worth the investment - I NEVER get telephone solicitations. If the number is blocked - your phone doesn't ring. All callers have to identify themselves. Once they identify themselves, your phone will ring but you still have the option of accepting or rejecting the call. If it is a soliciter - you then have the option of sending them a msg directing them to remove your number from their calling lists."
1,It's a joke,"I can't believe I got sucked into buying this thing. It doesn't work, don't waste your money buying this. My states have no call list that you can join through your attorney generals office. Check it out and save your money."
1,Not a complete solution,"I tried the Telezapper for a month, but ultimately returned it because too many telemarketers got through.I recently discovered the Screen Machine (also on Target.com) and so far it has screened out all telemarketing calls. Do not waste your money on the Telezapper."
2,Here's how to save your money,"Yes, telezapper will work in many cases & will reduce the # of solicitors. But, save your money - simply record the 3 tones for disconnected lines onto your answering machine - you WILL get the same results. I did and went from averaging about 6 calls per day to one. About 5 minutes of surfing led me to a web site that had these tones. The description about this box doesn't tell you exactly what it does for good reason - you don't need it!"
3,Is not compatible with my Siemens phone,"Here's what the manufacturer said:We have recently discovered that Siemens equipment is incompatible with the Telezapper. It has to do with the electrical components involved. I apologize for your inconvenience. Sincerely, Customer Service 12 1-800-373-6290 Monday-Friday 8AM-7PM EST"
1,Does not work.,"I bought this hoping to end the deluge of computer generated telemarketer calls which interrupt meals and favorite T.V. shows etc. I paid the (...)price shown above. I had it plugged in for about 2 weeks and had the same amount of calls as before. It is supposed to zap a telemarketer if they repeat call you, but it does not. I have enhanced caller id so I know this is true. Myself and a co-worker had the same results and we both returned our telezappers to the place of purchase for refunds."
1,The only thing it zaps is your ear,"It scared me as well as people that were calling. The beeping is obnoxious. My answering machine still worked okay, though.The telemarketers keep calling. The only way to get rid of telemarketers is to get rid of your landline phone and just use a cellular phone. I wholeheartedly suggest that to anyone who is fed up! As long as you have an alternate way to connect to the Internet :)."
1,sounds nice but it didn't work,"Setup was easy. Phones and fax machine continued to work just fine. But computer-generated calls still went through. We gave it a good try for about three weeks and then just sent it back. I read now that they say it is incompatible with Siemens phones. We have some siemens phones but also a fax machine and a non-siemens phone. The zapper was not attached to the siemens phone. I really can't see how it would interfere with it anyway. it generated the tone it said it would but the computer calls went through without a hitch. I really wished it worked, we are back to handing the phone to our young child who loves to talk when telemarketers call. That has gotten us off at least a few lists!"
1,Piece of junk,This item does not zap anything. I wish I had my money back. Amazon should be testing products like this before selling them.
1,Why am I still getting calls?,I thought this was a great idea and bought one. But after having it installed for 5 months I do not think it works. The computer calling places still call...do they simply ignore the outgoing beep? Did all the telemarketers get wise to this and simply ignore it? They must because the calls won't stop.
2,"Helps, but could be better","This model helped cut down on marketing calls quite a bit, but I still get at least one per night. The new model is a lot better, but I'm not going to buy that one. The state where I live, MN, just got a do not call list, which I think will work better than the Telezapper, old or new."
1,Telezapper,"Worked great for about a week, then i seemed to get an average of 12 telemarketing calls a day"
1,Did not work. Telemarketers immune?,"After months of this thing sending its electronic ""disconnected"" signal the calls had not abated. I don't think it works. Are the telemarketers wise to this ploy and simply ignore it? Maybe so.Finally I began answering the calls on speaker phone and making only a low growling sound like an angry animal. People in my home laugh, but the callers got scared off. A couple of weeks of growling and the calls stopped. I tossed this device out.I am being honest. I do not think this works at all."
1,might work,Did some quick research on this device and decided not to waste my $$$. All it can do is play the SIT tones that indicate your number is disconnected. You could record those tones on your answering machine yourself...just call a number you know is disconnected and record the tone.(...)
1,Didn't work at all,"The Telezapper does create a pause and a beep each time you pick up your phone, but it has not deterred a single telemarketer call. The beep happens, and then the sales pitch begins as usual. There has not been the slightest reduction in the amount of annoyance calls we received. It seems like the product is just as sleazy as the telemarketers it is supposed to combat. It was a total waste of money for us."
2,Not for GE Answering Machines,Seems to work as long as you don't let your GE Digital Answering machine take the call. This thing hangs it up! The Tech support from Privacy told me that this does not work with the GE machine.
3,"Good, but a few little quirks","Tired of all those calls? Caller ID not enough? This product does help to stop some of those telemarketing calls, but falls short on about 30% of the calls. Many telemarketing calls are just dialed from phone lists and other methods rather than the computer. This product does not stop those types of calls. The beep is also annoying when picking up the phone.Consider purchasing the optional service if available from your local phone company which screens callers by name. This is an enhancement to Caller ID. This has cut down on a lot of our telemarketing calls to our home, but worth [the money]? I am not sure if I would buy the product again, rather invest in the extra monthly service from the phone company."
5,Works,Have not had computer generated call in week that I have had it installed. Had 3 to 5 a day prior to instalation
2,I've been zapped,"I found the telezapper very easy to hook up and understand but, after less than two weeks I had to unhook it. It also will disconnect you from calls when someone calls you from a payphone and if you have family or friends that use calling cards it zaps them off also. After several diconnects from these types of calls I had to take it back off my phone. I called radio shack where it was purchased and they wouldn't take it back because I didn't have the original packaging. I complained to the manufacturer and they were aware of the problems I was experiencing but,said they did not know it was going to do this until after it was on the market. There is no mention of these problems in any of the information they provide on the telezapper. They also will not refund your money for the product even though it has some serious brawbacks. For me it was [amt] right down the drain. It does cut back the telemarketing calls and much more."
2,Still Getting Telemarketer Calls!,The TeleZapper has been a very poor substitute for Ameritech's Privacy Manager which worked 100% of the time. The Telezapper may have reduced some of the Telemarketing calls but it has definitely not eliminated them and we've had it for months. I'd recommend looking into alternatives before buying a TeleZapper.
1,Zapper doesn't zap much for me,"I have had the Telezapper hooked up to my phone for about 3 months now, and the telemarketing calls haven't stopped. Just this morning I got yet another call that obviously came from a predictive dialer -- you can tell when there's a momentary delay before the telemarketer comes on the phone -- the very type of call the Telezapper is supposed to intercept! So far my husband and I have yet to experience the silence on the end of the line that indicates a telemarketer's been zapped... and we get a lot of telemarketing calls. I am skeptical that this device really works, and the beep that answers EVERY call is both loud and annoying. I'd say save your [money] and take the phone off the hook during dinner, or just let it ring. Better yet, lobby your congress members and the FCC to establish a national do-not-call list, which would not only be free -- it's our right!!!"
3,Telezapper may or may not be the tool for you.,"The TeleZapper works if you pick up the phone to a predictive computer dialer. If you have an answering machine (local) on your phone it will work, but if you have a voice message vendor it will not hit those calls. You can record your message with the 3 disconnect tones and get full protection... The actual frequency of these tones are 985.2 Hz, 1370.6 Hz, and 1776.7 Hz, recorded in 1 sec bursts for 3 seconds. The free tones do not protect you if you pick up on a predictive dialer call so you make the call... pun intended. Maybe the company can send you a disk with the tones on to complete the system."
5,Recorded SIT tone --DIDN't WORK ! TELEZAPPER IS BETTER,I decided to research the TeleZapper and what it was about and read some of the reviews on here. Well I wanted to save myself some money so I decided to dowload the SIT tone onto my answering machine from the web. Well IT DIDN't WORK!! I still got telemarketing calls... over 8 a day!I bought the TeleZapper and now I don't get 1! Thank you to whoever decided to create this little gadget. Don't waste your time on the net downloading an SIT tone. Go for the TELEZAPPER IT WORKS and its worth every penny! Take it from someone who's always trying to save a buck.
2,Check out details,"This product does what it claims, with one problem. Not only does it stop tele-marketers, it stops all calls that are from 800 numbers and those made using several phone cards, especially those purchased from Wal-Mart. If you don't get these calls, this product is for you. But, if you get important calls that are through 800 numbers or family and friends who use phone cards, then think first before getting this product. An answering maching is better."
1,"Works in some cases, but not many","Most telemarketers do not work off of a predictive dialer computer...the kind of computer this device is supposed to ""ZAP""Telemarketers primarily use printout lists of prospects using the latest public information databases and demographic databases.If you're a telemarketer, don't be scared by this device. Especially if you're working off a printed list...just laugh and politely tell them that their Telezapper device won't work as there's no computer to ""ZAP"", but tell them that you'll remove them off your list. There are compliance issues to take care of, no matter what type of telemarketing you might do.In any case, the Telezapper is nothing more than a tone box which duplicates the same 3 annoying tones that you get when you dial a disconnected number or ""...must first dial a 1"", etc. I can think of a million other things I'd rather do with 50 bucks than buy this trinket."
2,worthless product,"Save your money, it doesn't work. The little beep when you pick up phone will drive you batty. The telemarketers still call."
1,Don't waste your money,"I got the TeleZapper when the ""Out of Area"" calls on our Caller ID hit 13 in one day. I bought it and kept it on our phone line, following their directions for 4 weeks. We're now up to 20 in a day and the TeleZapper has been returned. I bought mine at Best Buy and should have gotten a hint from the fact that all of the TeleZapper boxes appeared to be taped (e.g. returned and repackaged). At the exact time I returned mine, someone else was also returning one. My advice to you is, don't bother."
2,Barely adequate,"Good first attempt at the task. The second generation model, CTZ900 Telezapper II uses the THREE tones necessary to remove your number from all of the current computer lists."
1,great idea......but it breaks my answering machine,"What a great idea! Too bad the answering machine hears the quick signal and stops recording. As a result, nobody can leave me messages. As much as I hate telemarketers I still need a functional answering machine. :-(FYI: I have the digital GE model answering machine."
2,Does this thing really zap calls?,"The phone was waking me up all the time from a deep sleep (I work nights.) I still needed to have my phone on in case my boss called. That's why I bought the TeleZapper.After 2 months, I still can't tell if its really working. I've read some of the reviews and some have mentioned a beep when picking up their phone - mine doesn't do that at all, but the thing blinks for every computer-dialed call.It probably filters out some of the calls, but this weekend I received several calls from a company (DialAmerica-boy, I'd like to sue these people) that's pestered me for years - apparently the Zapper doesn't work on them. My father called me with a calling card and the thing blinked.This unit is so unpredictable and I've had better luck telling telemarketers to simply buzz off. Maybe it works if you get 20 calls a day, but for me 1 call is too many."
1,"Telezapper, just a noise maker, save your money.","They should take this item off the market. It doesn't do anything but make a tone when you pick up your phone. The unit came dead on arrival. I called the support number for the manufacturer. I told him that it didn't make any tones as described in the manual. He was very unresponsive and said if telemarketers weren't calling it must be working. End of conversation. Well the calls kept coming in. I called again and spoke to someone else. It was determined that it indeed arrived DOA. No offer was made to send it back only to go to the dealer with it. I opened it up and tested the battery. Only 2 volts from the required 3 volts. Off I go to put in another 6 dollars for a battery. OK, now I get the tone. Calls keep coming in, the thing is a dust collector.Maybe people will read this and save money and frustration."
3,telezapper review,This device is simple to hook up but the technology is outdated. Anonymous calls are NOT blocked out and telemarketers have new dialing technology.It does emit a series of tones when an an unidentified call comes in but has little effect.
1,Torn Binders,"I have purchased three of them and all three were torn from sides and corners. Also it doesn't have any thing to writ on from the side as the picture is showing.So to sum it up don't buy this bad quality binders, it is not worth the money."
4,3 ring binder with two inch rings.,There is no pocket to put a label in on the spine. To label the binder a marker or stick on label will have to be used. At this price though that is a small thing. I think they will hold up for my use but if it is going to be opened and closed a lot I think I would go with a better quality binder. They call it a basic binder and that is just what it is at a very attractive price.
5,Lustro Crumb Sweeper,While at a local restaurant we happened to see this crumb sweeper in action by our waitress. As soon as we got home we went on to Amazon and ordered this sweeper. A truly wonderful product!
5,Great crumber!!!!!!,"I love this crumber!!!. It seems unbendable, which is really good because I have been through sooooo many of the other cheaper crumbers and then bend when you look at them. Great product for us servers who take their job seriously. My co-workers are sooooo jealous. I may have to purchase some for them. Thanks."
2,Too much,"Unless you specifically need this type of crumber, you might as well go for the cheap kind with the clip. As many crumbers as I've lost, this one is great, but I don't need such fanciful tools! The two dollar ones work just as well."
1,Not what is advertised,"This product is NOT a sweeper! A crumb sweeper has rotating brush to actively brush crumbs into a container. Rather, it is a scraper/scoop. It will not pick up crumbs from textured surfaces. such as table cloths with deep texture.The edge of an old credit card will do as good a job of removing crumbs."
3,Good book but not as good as past ones,"I am a big fan of Dorothy Garlock's novels. This one was slightly dissapointing to me. It carried less suspense and romantic confliction than in the past. We were told right away who and why people were committing the crime, unlike past novels that made you wonder. Also, the romance between Kate and Tate was slighly ho-hum, without the normal conflicts that have made Garlock's characters realistic. This one was still entertaining and I wanted to finish it, but it was more predictable than we may be expecting from this talented author."
4,Entertaining Romance With Adventure,"This is a story of adventure in Texas and romance in the 1930s. When Kate plans to take the train from New York to California to practice medicine with her uncle, little did she know that she would be kidnapped along the way and her plans would change when she finds romance. Dorothy Garlock is one of my favorite authors and this book did not let me down. I love how she can tell the story in such a way that it makes me feel as though I'm right there or watching a movie. I enjoyed this book very much even though it was predictable!"
5,A good double story.,"Barrie Roberts, again using the theme that he has access to a lost manuscript written by Dr. James Watson, does a good job in Sherlock Holmes And The King's Governess. It is a double story as the reader will quickly see the parallel between Holmes's latest client Diana Fordeland and the real Anna Leonowens (of Anna and the King of Siam fame). Watson uses names to protect the people living at the time, however the novel uses real personalities during this period. Diana or Anna is in London for the Queen's Jubilee and to see her former student, now the visiting king or Mongkuria (Siam). She is stalked by Russian agents and the detective story quickly becomes one of international intrigue. Very well done and fast moving. As much as I enjoy new stories about Sherlock Holmes it makes you wonder if Watson wasn't the sloppiest man in England with the hundreds, maybe thousands, of unpublished manuscripts that are somehow being found by modern writers."
4,Fun for the office cubicle,"I bought this as an amusement for my cubicle at work. It's wonderful. Lots of fun to stack up the blocks and let the marbles roll when the day has been too long, the computer has been too obstinate, and you've had cause to question the sanity of the powers that be."
4,Third graders love it,My third graders look forward to indoor recess so that they can play with the blocks and marbles! The blocks and marbles encourage creativity.
4,OK,"Some interesting insights here, but some more editing was required -- some sections seem like he's just repeating himself or going through the motions. The book could have been shorter."
3,Why we buy,"This book contains some useful & practical info. However, the writer can provide the same info yet cut the no. of pages into half. The latter part is somewhat redundant and recapitulation of the info the author re-iterated earlier."
3,An introduction to motivation 101,"The WSJ gave a very accurate review of this book. Mr. Underhill unearths a few new terms and ideas, i.e., ""butt brush"", but little more. The subject of ""why we buy"" has eluded marketers since day 1. He has not got to the root of ""why"". For example, BA (before Amazon) I would go into my book store and choose titles in a rapid counter-clockwise sweep. Then I would take them off the shelf in a clock-wise route and end up at the cashier. Why? I'd like to know. Perhaps Mr. Underhill could really dig into this in a deeper way."
5,Loving this book,"I am about half way through the Why We Buy book, and I am loving this book. I am learning so many new things. Also this book is also helping me a lot in my marketing class at college."
4,A Great Book!,"A scientific research into buying behaviour of consumers, and what retailers should do. The Cyberspace section, i.e E commerce, are quite intresting facts enabled from the research. A Great Book! on the buying behaviour."
4,It will change the way you shop!,Very interesting. Shoppers who read this book will be surprised at the detail and science involved in every aspect of retail. And you thought you shopped alone. This book should be required reading for anyone entering the retail workplace.
4,Most informative book on the retail shopping experience.,"If you are interested in placing your merchandise, or message in front of the retail consumer with maximum impact, this book will open the door to a new way of thinking for you.You'll learn more from this book in a few hours, than you will in wasting a whole semester sitting in most college retail marketing classes."
1,Great for Managers!,"If you would enjoy having a shallow and superficial tour of retail stores, this is a great book for you. If you are looking for in-dpeth analysis of why people buy,how people shop,what people do when they shop, etc. so that you can understand shopping patterns, then look else where (like Daniel Millers book - A Theory of Shopping). But for easy answers to difficult problems, this book can't be beat."
4,"Retails stores must read this. Online, not-so-much.","We have an online retail store. There were some useful insights into human behavior that I was able to take away. A normal (brick-and-mortar) retail store would have much more to use from this book. The section on the internet and e-commerce was more of a rant against it. Paco should have someone younger and non-biased write that section. He obviously does not understand Gen-X and younger. Still, it was interesting for the human behavior statistics."
3,Wrong Title - Try HOW WE BUY,"I was dissapointed with this book - there is plenty of HOW provided through observation, but really no WHY - after all, Why is about what we do when we get the stuff home (will the kids use Brand X toothpaste as it was discounted or will this pack size remain fresh until we consume it all ?) rather than the process of how we pick it up and drop it in the shopping trolley.The observation stuff was interesting but failed to provide a decision making model of Why we do buy stuff. Read it in the library if you can find a copy."
3,Sometimes the obvious isn't so apparent,"I finally picked this one up after about a year of ""meaning to buy it."" I'm glad I did. It's a lighthearted and fun book that will make you analyze every store you set foot into and make you want to avoid many others. There are no earth-shattering ideas in here, but it does point out many of the obvious things you'd probably miss, ie: product placement, who the decision-makers are and traffic flow of the stores. It's written clear and concise, but recycles many of the examples. I read it over the course of 2 planetrips (with layovers) and will probably pass it along to a store-owner I know - meaning I won't be referencing it for the rest of my life, but I'll probably keep an eye to see what stores have read it and who should"
4,I enjoyed this book.,"I enjoyed this book immensly, because it examined a practice which we all seem to enjoy, yet we never stop to think about the different theories and practices within the industry. For example, we never think to ourselves how the merchandise is placed so that it is perfectly in our view, and how the store is laid out so that we take in all of the atmosphere and stimulents which are directed towards us. As with all books, the reader will find some parts of this book to be somewhat ""boring"", but you will find plenty of instances where you find yourself saying ""so that is why they do that"" and ""gee, i never realized that""."
3,Needs heavy editing,"I wish someone would edit out all the self-references to the author's company and his autobiographical ramblings. Also, there is hardly anything to be learned from the chapters on the Internet and global markets.Yes, there is info in there, but it could be much better."
1,Disappointed and Misleading,"Did I miss something?Call me crazy, I thought this book was to be about ""Why We Buy"". I think I can count about two pages of gender specific characteristics on purchasing, otherwise this book was anecdote after anecdote of ""stupid"" things retailers do. The book's title was extremely misleading. Perhaps ""How to Sell"" would have been more appropriate. ""How to Sell"" and ""Why We Buy"" are two totally different animals.And what's with our author telling us, time and time again, the simple solution to those ""stupid"" retailer mistakes while offering no quantitative results to back up his suggestions (which is kind of interesting based on the fact that's what he does for a living).Overall, I feel cheated because our author has insight and knowledge to share that he simple chooses not to. I guess I'll have to hire Envirosell to get those answers I thought would be in the book. But then again, that's probably why he wrote the book."
1,SINCE WHEN IS RETAIL ROCKET SCIENCE? Puh-lease.,"I thought this was a clever and artfully written book that should not be treated as the scientific DOGMA that it has been taken for. The author's background and credentials are questionnable at best, and his research methodolgies are no-brainers, not to mention UNscientific. He is an ""urban planner"", ""retail anthropologist"" who has added ""best selling author"" to his list of titles. Make no mistake, THERE IS NO ""SCIENCE"" OF SHOPPING and Mr. Underhill is no retail rocket scientist."
1,255 page advertisement for the author,"While Underhill has some good insights, these nuggets are buried beneath the author's self-promotional advertising--repeatedly telling us how his is the ""only company doing this kind of research"" and congratulating himself on his well-done job. Why would I pay for HIS advertising?"
4,Interesting book for anyone who sells or buys something...,"I am not in retailing business but I still found this book very interesting and I got so many great ideas how to improve some of my favorite stores. It made me look the shopping from a completely different angle. I believe this book is a must for every shopkeeper, architect, designer, visualizer and so on."
1,"Complicated reading, words, words, words","Definitely not the author for me,(Sanguine temperment. If you enjoy science blended with retail knowledge then have at it."
4,Interior Architect Learns Secrets of Shoppers,"This book provides excellent insight into the minds of retail shoppers. I would recommend it to anyone involved in the design, marketing, manufacturing, or business fields...it's pretty interesting even if you don't make a living off of it. Muy bien."
3,Good Retail Intro...,"A good read if you are a marketing or advertising professional who wants to get some insight into the retail psychology and its operations. However, there is no magic formula or scientific methodology given in this book.Besides making a lot of publicity for his company, Paco Underhill gives a lot of very interesting & practical examples of the consumer's shopping psychology and how it all translates in the retail environment. Paco will tell you why shoppers intuitively steer to the right upon entering a store and how retail managers can use that information to increase their revenues. Overall, not an extraordinary book by any means, but full of interesting examples and stories that could come in handy for any business professional."
2,Not why; but how!,"From a laymen's view, it seems like Paco Underhill's methods have merit. Because this book reads like a how-to for retailers, it makes me wonder why more companies don't use or at least study Mr. Underhill's findings. The information in the first few chapters is fun, after that it's a little redundant."
3,Great read but does not explain why people buy.,"This is a beautifully-written book but it does not explain why people buy. It talks anecdotally about how merchants can create a more pleasant and informative buying environment for shoppers. This is an important subject and is where Underhill's has considerable experience and expertise. He makes a lot of suggestions about further improvements he would like to see in the consumer's shopping experience. He seems to really struggle to explain the Internet's impact on shopping. The later part of the book, which appears to have been written about a decade after the original publication, has an end-of-career feel to it with lots of retrospective comments and bouquets tossed in all directions. Again, terrific writing and some interesting personal observations, philosophies and travel experiences but not a full-bodied explanation as to why people buy."
1,Book can be summed up in a few pages,"I really didn't get much of value out of this book. Long winded, little actual data. A book to skim through. Most of the book is spent on impressing you on how great the author is for figuring things out. Ah, how I hate books written for money and not substance."
3,Great for shoppers,"If you like to shop, this book is for you. You'll recognize yourself in the shoppers Underhill describes, and find yourself laughing at how fickle you really are in your shopping preferences.I am surprised at the venom displayed in many of the other reviews. While Why We Buy isn't the best book ever written (not many nonfiction books are), it certainly is entertaining."
2,Disappointed reader,"I had to read this book for a retail business class that I took. When I started to read the book, I was impressed and found the process and insights very interesting. The longer I read the book, the worse it became. If you are an experienced retail manager, this is probably not a book for you. If you are a student or new to retail, you might find this book helpful, at least the opening chapters. The chapter on international expansion is totally worthless and shares no insights to shopping."
4,The Entrepreneur's Pocket Guide,"I find that this book is very helpful for the person that has their own business. It shows and describes why people buy and what makes retail work. It is a good read, although some of his points could be made by anyone. Some observations are pretty normal that he makes. That being said, the points that he does come to conclude that are actually interesting are some that would help any entrepreneur."
5,"Fun, informative, must-read book on consumer behavior","I recommend this book to clients all the time. Underhill's terrific stories and wealth of knowledge applies to so many businesses, not just retail stores. It's on my permanent client reading list."
4,Really gets you thinking about the tactics of marketing,"This book taught me that implementing an environment which promotes the consumers impulsive purchasing nature requires a scientific approach. I dont think I'll ever walk into a store with blinders on again.The author gives examples of changes/results that were made based on projects his consulting company EnviroSell worked on. However, these are very small tidbits of information. They serve to make points, not as a general framework of the science.Overall, I think the book is designed to raise awareness to a new field of study--the Science of Shopping. If applied, retail environments will increase sales, and consumers will be better served.I would have liked to see little sidebars with statistics relating to the authors consulting experiences."
4,Revised Commentary,"I would like to ammend an earlier review I had written about this book, criticizing Envirosell's website, and how little Underhill had written about e-commerce,I had knocked his company's website for not providing the most basic information such as names, contacts. etc. After another Amazonian e-mailed me, I realized that, for whatever reason, the first page of his website did not download when I wrote my review. Now I have seen that all the points I had made about his company's website are wrong. And I sincerely apologize for my earlier remarks about his website, and am taking this step of rewriting my commentary to be more fair to Underhill and his colleagues in this regard. The book was very well done, and, who knows, maybe his next book will be all about e-commerce! I hope it is"
3,Shoemaker's Child,"All in all an interesting book, but particularly lacking on e-commerce. Take a look at his own website, Envirosell.com is worse than he criticizes in his own book. No address, phone number,or function to email him about retaining his services."
3,From a psychology major and now business editor...,"I take my hat off to Underhill's methodology, the examination of human behavior and then crunching out the numbers to cross-match patterns. However,I have criticisms: who is the reader: the consumer, the retailer, pysch majors, business editors, or future clients? I suspect future clients, which is cool. In some instances he told us a whole lot of nothing: most notablly, way too many pages devoted to signage, yawn. So having said that,I'm going to auction off his book on amazon.auctions, see if I learned anything from his insights into merchandising and pyschology and see if I can get more money for this book that amazon is selling for retail! Afterall, he painstakingly dissed e-commerce and had little to contribute to the topic. But all in all, he sounds like a nice guy, with a great business model."
2,Medium,"Why We Buy, did not satisfy my taste. I expected to find out why we buy, not to find out how to set up a business to attract more customers. It is not really about the science of shopping!"
2,Why did I buy!!,I listened to the audio version of this book. I purchased it for under $4.50. I should have saved my money. The narrator was great but the content was weak and repetitive. I would not recommend this book.
3,Interesting,Interesting and insightful with some good tips for people setting up an interactive environment like a shop or a library. It seemed more like an ad for his services and/or his other books but it was a good introduction to the principles behind his business.
4,Never shop the same again!,The book is an excellent book for those in the retail industry. I am looking at going into the Electronic commerce area of retail and this book has made me think of ways that the proposed methods used in the normal retail environment can be applied in E-COmmerce. It is easy to read and the examples are also good. It is not just for a particular group in the retail industry but for everyone. Having lived in the States I can relate to a lot of the topics and I can also compare the retail experience in Europe with that of the States.
2,Very basic common sense here,I didn't get a heck of a lot out of this book. Telling me to put something at eye level in a store and it will sell better was just a waste of my time. I actually found all the examples rather juvenille and the research foolish.
1,not for shoppers,"A better title for this book would be ""How we Shop and Why We Don't Buy."" We don't buy because the aisles are too narrow, we can't reach the product, we can't try the product, there are no baskets to carry purchases, the lines are too long, etc., etc. There's absolutely nothing here that shoppers don't know."
1,Almost enough material for a magazine article,"Paco Underhill, with the help of a good editor, could have stretched this material to make an interesting article on selling. Then we only would have had to concern ourselves with the fact that the title is buying. Instead, he chose to repeat himself endlessly and to wander aimlessly until the magical number of pages were written that could be called a book. Hopefully he is better at researching the subject of buying than he is at writing about it."
3,Good humorous shopping experiences........,Paco Underhill has written a humorous book with lots of common sense about the whole experience of shopping. He shows us how different men & women are when they shop. He also talks about the neglected shoppers: children and senior citizens. Many retailers should take note of this book and offer it to all their managers. Many of the initiatives he mentioned are so easy to implement and yet people do not have the common sense to see them through. Most of his ideas will increase sales for the retailers that apply them. A very interesting read this Why We Buy.
3,If only he had asked a librarian.,"I enjoyed Mr Underhills book; however, I would have enjoyed it more if it had had graphics. I have noticed that non-fiction books with graphics in them go out more often than ones with out the visuals. Perhaps a picture of the butt-brush effect :-)"
2,Why?,"This is just very sad. Like old boxers, singers need to know when to hang it up too. The voice is a rasping skeleton of what it used to be. The King has been running on fumes for over 25 years now. It's time to put it to bed B.B. Your concerts are a traveling travesty. Seriously, all these ""Legends"" tours are just a big marketing shams for suburbanites with nothing better to do."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book after seeing some of the flashy reviews on Amazon, but must say was extremely disappointed. This book is good if you are just looking for superficial information about where WLAN's are being used and how. It misses the mark entirely if you want details on the physical and the MAC layer. Also there is only a passing mention of the next standard that is expected to take off in the 5.6GHz frequency range (802.11a). It is a ok book if you are unfamiliar with the DS and FH modulation schemes employed in the 2.4GHz range (802.11b)."
2,better than Lacey but not a lot,"They teach that divorce is possible, but not remarriage. This was NOT the way 1st century Jews and Gentiles would understand the relevant verses. For that, see David Instone-Brewer's ""Divorce and Remarriage: The Social and Literary Context"" which gives a comprehensive teaching in this sensitive area."
4,A Stunning Ring,"Very beautiful ring that fits like a class ring. It's big, but not too big. It has a unique design and it's shiny. I just purchased it and I'm very happy with it. Silver Insanity has a variety of quality jewelry to choose from and they provide excellent customer service with each transaction. I recommend this ring."
3,A little disappointed,"I have to admit, I love Louise Hay and her books, but I felt this one was slightly disappointing. Its probably because I was expecting written meditations similar to her CDs, but this book seems more to me like affirmations rather than meditations. It does cover a broad range of topics, alphabetically which I do find helpful, but I am not sure how to use this book. Perhaps I am not used to the format, but I thought after reading her book, You Can Heal Your Life, I was so inspired and thought that this book would do the same. And it feel slightly short of my expectations after reading her other book. I will likely use it when I need to focus on one issue at a time so it will be good for that. I do also find when talking to clients and friends about specific issues I point them to a section of this book. If you are looking for a better book by Louise, I suggest You Can Heal Your life before picking up this one."
4,Try this and see,Loved it it gives us hope and some kind of understanding of what we can achieve if we really want to change yourself within. All of us can learn something from this book.
4,Great gift - not really meditations but uplifting paragraphs....,"Beautiful book, uplifting writings on different topics that will be of help to someone. Not really meditations, I don't think. But definately a great book."
1,not very helpful,"This book is an expanded version of the Heal your Life A-Z. She tries to tell you if you have a certain health problem, it's all due to an emotional issue. There is no science involved; which I find ridiculous. We all know certain things are in our genes, that heredity plays a big part in our health. The foods we put in our body and exercise (or lack of it) all contribute to our health problems - it's not all about our feelings. I hope no one takes this too seriously."
2,Buy one of her other books....,"Ok if you just need simple affirmations to mediate, buy this one or from my point of view go to the library. But if I were you, I would get Life! or her most famous book You can heal your life, because than you can have affirmations/ extra info (can't explain it here sorry) and a guide with a dictonary with physical signs, for example a headache means you have no intregrity or selfcritism or fear and than you get some affirmations which will change that. The basic idea of L.Hay is if you say enough times you love yourself, you will do that in the end and from that point show it on the outside."
5,My Support Group Requests That I Bring This Book,"As a professional counselor, I share this special book with a group of cancer survivors. Each week one person volunteers to open the book to a random page and reads Louise's meditation to the group. Everyone agrees that whatever message is opened is the one the group needs for that week. The meditations are powerful and awaken a positive spirit in each of us. They have made a big difference in the ""can do"" attitude of the group and have become the focus for our best discussions."
4,I admit I was a bit embarrassed to be reading this book in public,"I admit I was a bit embarrassed to be reading this book in public, but it is an amazing book for any point in your life.I recently started studying Buddhism (as a philosophy) and found this book. Actually, things in my life were falling apart, and this literally saved me from falling into depression or making some impulsive decisions.The idea is to cultivate compassion; compassion for others but for yourself, something many of us have forgotten, or perhaps did not realize it. A crucial point of the book is the idea of becoming intimate with fear ... something many of us avoid and cover with self-sabotaging activities, addictions, eating, drug use etc. The idea that you can live your life without any uncomfortable feelings (fear, loneliness, anxiety etc) and live in endless pleasure is delusional. Thus, becoming ""friendly"" with these feelings allows one to observe instead of react."
5,Mediatations to heal your life,This is very good self-improvement for everyone. It helps to resolve any kinds of issues with emotional and psychological problems. Helps to live in whole life and be self-sufficient.
1,It broke,"Had mine for about 4 months, used it occasionally, no heavy torquing of any screws. I really thought this was a good product, till I tried using it this afternoon and it wouldn't make a sound. I think the power switch feels different, so I suspect it broke. It was only $10 at Kmart, so I guess I got my money's worth."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I was a little disappointed with the product because I thought it would have more power. I tried using it a couple of times, but the drill bit just spun without tightening the screw. It required A LOT of pressure to get the screw to move, and I could have put that much pressure into it and done it myself."
1,Looks very nice but reverse hardly works at all.,"I purhcased this item from a local hardware store here in NJ in Dec. 2008.The forward works okay but don`t try to use the reverse it hardly works at all. I tired to return it but since it was used the manager said no.I needed the reverse to remove a lot of screws from my old apartment`s walls prior to moving.I ended up going to K mart at the last second and buying a very cheap power screw driver that works much better.Now I can just add a cotton ball to the tip of this one and use it to remove ear wax! All joking aside, the item LOOKS very nice but failed to perform the ONE function I needed it for."
3,"Does what I need it to, but wish it had a bit more power","The title kinda says it all. I do low voltage data cable work and I use this product to detach and install internet jack face plates from the walls. This item is ALMOST perfect for me but I wish it had just a bit more torque and power. As it is, I know it'll never go too fast to crack a face plate but the screws still go in a bit too slow.Upon reading several reviews on Amazon, this is the only Black and Decker item of this type I would buy since I now don't trust this company's rechargeable batteries. The AA's that these use is perfect for me since I already have my own rechargeables."
3,Gouging on the price...,"MSRP on this model (AS600) is $22. Similar model (AS603) is 9.99 from Target.These are excellent light duty screwdrivers, handy for those small jobs. Three stars only because of the outrageous mark-up of this vendor."
4,Handy little item,"I build computers, and this is a real handy tool. It works well, the build is solid, and it uses batteries--a great feature considering most batteries in rechargeable battery tools tools ""poop"" long before the rest of the tool.I wish it were a little faster, or had a speed control. I also wish it had a magnetic tip to hold screws securely.All in all, though, a nice little tool."
5,Great tool,"I have somehow ended up with 3 of these through moving several times. Got my first one back in the 90's, and it still works great. Being able to put new batteries in once it starts to slowdown is great when I have a lot of stuff to screw in (like rooms worth of Ikea funiture). It takes all the standard driver pieces from any multi-driver, so I use it instead of the little allen wrenches that come with ikea/saunders furniture."
3,"good, not great","It does what it claims to, but could be more powerful and maneuverable. No regrets on the purchase, but I'm sure there are better options."
2,"Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy","I bought this item based on the reviews and the fact that my two cordless drills both had their batteries go belly up because they only get used sporadically - so the alkaline power source seemed a good fit. My first, and only, project with this screwdriver was replacing the magnetron on my microwave - all it had to do was unscrew about 25 sheetmetal screws and then replace them. No major torque jobs or anything, but by the end of the project the screwdriver was out of power and wouldn't tighten the screws even snug. It's handy to have around if all you need to do is remove faceplate covers from your switches and wall plugs, save you from having to do it manually, but doesn't have any power or stamina. I can't imagine somebody trying to use this product for woodscrews."
2,Weak and flimsy,Not nearly enough torque. The manual mode option is just silly. Get theBlack & Decker LI3000 3.6-Volt Lithium-Ion Cordless Screwdriverinstead.
3,"Waste of Talent, they could of done better","Play n skills, they ok, dont get me wrong they have talent, they just havent figured out how to use it, they talk about the same stuff. They do got some good songs though like ""Call Me"" and ""Latinos Stand Up"", i feel i wasted my money though, i should of downloaded it 4 free."
1,disc failure,Most of the 8.5GB 8X double layer discs failed during burning process. I had to purchase a pack at Sams to complete the task at hand. I do not know if RIDATA/RITEK discs are compatible. Thank you for asking. This is the first product purchased at AMAZON that was unsatisfactory. Sorry for this bad review. miguel quezada customer PS (The shipping and timeliness of arriving in a speedy manner is to be commended. to bad about the prodict itself.)
3,Great Quality,I love Chicago Metallic products. That said - I could have made biscotti as easily forming them myself. If you've never made biscotti this would be helpful.
5,Sublime Performance,"A wonderfully performed and recorded Vespers (All Night Vigil) by the greatest choir of its type anywhere. If you are unfamiliar with this work by Rachmaninov but love choral music, take a chance and buy this CD. You will not be disappointed."
3,Not bad but not good,I love old science fiction but this might be a little too old ; ) I found some parts very confusing; how did Norma get her powers exactly? There is no way I would have kept reading if the novel had been over three hundred pages.
4,Nice and short product of its time,I wouldn't underrate this book so much -- I thought it was as good as many a sci-fi miniseries. It took me a couple of hours to get through on a hot summer's evening. The author spins a yarn with plenty of arresting scenes and ideas. The time-travelling kidnappers of the future justify their practice by saying that it's the responsibility of every man to fight for his planet. Van Vogt was prolific and it's good to think that minor works should in some way be kept alive. 20 cents a copy -- not many prices have changed that little since the 1950s!
4,"great for curly hair, but don't get product on the floor!","This stuff is great when used lightly, but don't forget to wipe down the bathroom tile, or else you're likely to slide around. But that's the only drawback. Smells great; works great."
2,Must Contain Nickel,"I'm highly allergic to nickel, it's my only allergy so I bought this item since it was supposed to be a sterling silver thing to connect it to the chain. It must have had nickel since I had a severe reaction to them with a short while of wearing it. Also their necklace chains caused severe reaction as well.Other than the nickel problem it is a very beautiful necklace and very pretty in the sun, would highly recommend if you have no nickel problem."
4,Broselmaschine - self-titled (Spalax),"German psychedelic / folk band's sole lp - initially saw the light of day in 1971. Tracks that I dug the most are ""Gedanken"" (English translation: Mind), the simply beautiful ""Gitarrenstuck"" (trans: Guitar Stuck) and a couple of awesome epics this CD has to offer - the nine-minute ""Schmetterling"" (translation: Butterfly) and the eight-minute ""Nossa Boba"". Yet, another over-looked gem that many fans of the krautrock (and / or) psychedelic genre should enjoy. Line-up: Jenni Schucker - flute & vocals, Willi Kismer - guitar, zither & vocals, Lutz Ringer - bass & metallophon, Mike Hellbach - congas, tablas & mellotron and Peter Bursch - acoustic guitar, sitar, flute & vocals. Recommended for fans of EMTIDI, Annexus, Hoelderlin and possibly (don't hold me to it) Eela Craig. Definitely, an acquired taste."
1,Not Good Quality,I bought this product few months back. I used it for printing at home. The ink dried off within 2 months with very limited printing. Disappointed
1,Una verdadera porqueria,"Un llibro lleno de afirmaciones falsas de terceros que normalmente fueron expulsados, lo que le confiere un carac ter absolutamente dudoso a todo lo que dice. Es como preguntarle a un universitario que fue expulsado, cuan buena es esa universidad. Usted cree que dira algo bueno???"
3,Not very informative,I have read many books on the JW's. This one seems short and thrown together. It would be a good starter book for someone interested in the subject. I need a little more meat personally.
1,Terrible product!,Why would anyone talk bad about people whom are only doing what Jesus and his followers done. The Bible say follow Jesus footsteps closely. All people should witness about the Almighty God. This book is a waste.
4,Great book for what it is intended to do,THis book proves that the watchtower is a false prophet and proves the diety of Christ. Very compelling evidence which includes actual copies of the Watchtower. I am new to learning how to answer a JW and was looking for more of an introduction to disputing a JW but this book does not advertise that.I recommend this book as part of your learning experience in answering/debating a Jehovah's Witness.
5,His last days,"I cannot speak to what happened to Saint Exupery. He disappeared shortly after writing this masterpiece. Some say that this should have not been released at all, out of respect for the writer. I disagree. This is part of the tapestry that was his life. We had so little time with him. As Stacy Schiff said""he pursued time more than it courted him"". I can read this, his last intended release, and draw many conclusions about his state of mind and his intentions the day that he flew off, never to return. Nothing has ever been proven. All I know is, he shared this book with many. He read it to a girlfriend completely. He wanted to read it cover to cover in one sitting. He was tired from a trip and he finished reading it to her later. My point, he loved this book. I love it too. If you love Saint Exupery, read this book last. It's a real jewel."
5,For the music primarily 'Old Man River' by William Warfield steals the showboat,"I could not make any sense of the plot of this movie when I saw it. But I was taken , moved greatly by the music. It is Jerome Kern at his greatest. And the greatest of all is of course William Warfield singing 'Old Man River'. It is one of the greatest American songs, and I believe expresses do deeply the suffering of black( then 'Negro')Americans, but also of humanity in general. The deep resonant rich voice of Warfield evokes that suffering and its transformation into a kind of sympathy and longing that elevates the soul.There are of course other great musical numbers also, and the whole score, and the way it is presented make this movie enjoyable whether the story makes much sense or not."
3,color oversaturated?? garish,"I rented this movie from Netflix, and the quality is so bad, it looks like someone transferred it from an old VCR. The skin tones look like they were painted on. I am searching for clues if there is a better version, faithfully restored. Again, ""Old Man River"" can't be beat. Now want to view the Paul Robeson version, if it's available."
5,"If you like musicals, you'll love it!","An excellent cast, a great story, and that MGM treatment makes this one of my all-time favorites. Can't view it without crying, no matter how many times I see it! Get the soundtrack, too."
5,Super music and story regarding life on he Missippi ShowBoat,"I loved this movie because I fell in love with the music score by Kern & Hammerstein. The duets between Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel will bring a tear to your eyes. Ava Gardner as the Malotto, Julie, passing for White, singing ""Along Came Bill,"" will stay with you. See it!"
3,Great movie. Major restoration needed.,"I enjoyed this movie immensely. The colors are fantastic and the filming and acting are very well done. The reason I give it only 3 stars is that there is some severe film damage that is evident. The entire dusk scene where ""Old Man River"" is first sung shows a great many artifacts running up both the left and right sides of the picture. The damage doesn't appear anywhere else in the movie. It's my hope that some studio will take the time and restore this picture to it's former glory."
4,A great movie,"There is little that can be said about the movie that hasn't already been said. It is a wonderful, vibrant and enchanting movie. Like the book it is not all ""fun and games"" but the story is great. If you like good, old fashioned Hollywood musicals this is one of the best."
3,Finest movie version of this musical,"Show Boat is considered the first ""modern"" musical. And although it has some pacing issues and the lack of any big chorus numbers it is still a fine musical.This version of the musical is excellent. The performances are well done, the vocals are excellent. Although Howard Keel's performance is a little over the top and he smiles like a mad scientist, it still works for the show."
2,"Beautiful picture, lousy sound","Unfortunately, the sound on this classic recording is awful. It is a shame, because the picture quality is very good. I am going to return this copy and reorder, so see if I got a bad copy, or if they are all this way."
5,A better time,"Having been born in Hannibal, MO in 1939 and seeing paddlewheel boats during my youth, the nostalgia in this film often brings me to tears. Howard Keel, Kathryn Grayson, Ava Gardner and Joe E. Brown perform beyond my expectations as they chronicle a time long past. Jerome Kern's lyrics and Oscar Hammerstein's musical score are combined with two of the finest MGM musical stars of all times, Ms. Grayson and Mr. Keel. Sadly the DVD is not available in 5-track. My children and now my grandchildren all listen to and enjoy this wonderful movie. Have no doubt, this DVD is a must for anyone who wants a taste of the Golden Years of musicals."
5,A Musical ideal,"My sister and I have been renting each of the Hollywood musicals but her favorite Show Boat was not available for two years or more. Finally, one day it was off my wished-for queue and on my waiting list; I quickly moved it up to the topand when it arrived we sat together to watch it. The film medium was re-mastered and it looks like it did in the theaters when we were just girls. We loved this movie so much, I ordered it for her birthday and will present it this week.The movie is very good and the DVD is terrific. Some day she'll have a whole collection of our favorites."
2,Not as Good As the 1936 Version,"If you want to enjoy Showboat, get the 1936 version. It is much better. The story in this version makes no sense and some of the best songs have been cut out."
4,Showboat,"I like the ""old"" musicals. This one was a classic. It had other ""remakes"", but this is the version I would recommend. Very good and entertainment for all. One I will watch over again. Highly urge someone who enjoys musicals to see."
2,Seriously?,"dude my copy said ""Avenge"" instead of ""Avenged""..for the first few weeks since its release it hasnt changed until now..any way..get ALL Excess..even tho it was only made prior City Of Evil and before Self Titled Album, it sure as hell explains alot more of the band than this does..its almost like a lil 6th grade kid made this for a video project or something..so if your a true a7x fan..dont bother..i doubt this was even approved by a7x anyway"
1,Do not buy this DVD !,"I was very disapointed with the DVD, the image and sound quality are very poor, the interviews are useless. The one and only DVD you should buy is the ""All Excess"" ."
1,Not worth the money.,"Got some insight of the new dvd of Avenge Sevenfold: The Metal Kings (spelled this way) is not worth the money. Not only the people spelled the bands name wrong its just a educational version of the bands life with photos and non audio videos of their shows, there is no interviews of the any of the bands mates it looks like some high school kid did this on his computer. it's not even sponsored by the band's label. I am a huge fan of Avenged Sevenfold but this dvd just disappointed me...Does the band's manager know about this???"
2,Waste of time and money,"The name was spelled wrong on the DVD ""Avenge Sevenfold"". Sound and picture quality sucked. Music that accompanied sucked. Didn't play any Avenged Sevenfold music or interview the band and the people they did interview, they didn't say who they were. Do not spend your money on this dvd! Buy the ""All Axcess"" dvd instead."
2,Complete dissatisfaction.,Bad quality. Same customer service. Ask about their return policy on unopened item...you'll be surprised. I would not reccomend that.
