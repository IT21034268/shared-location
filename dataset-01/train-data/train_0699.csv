3,Decent way to pass the time,There are some great ideas for stories here but Neil doesn't seem to know how to end them in a memorable way.
4,he shoots ... he scores!,"Loved ""Neverwhere"" - a really fun idea, skilfully wrought (though sadly butchered into a truly Godawful TV adaptation), also ""Good Omens"" and (especially) Gaiman's rendition of the Mr. Punch mythos. I don't read a lot of fiction, but I'm definitely drawn to dark fantasy; Neil Gaiman ranks alongside Steven King as a storyteller and nearly matches Clive Barker as a wordsmith. ""Smoke and Mirrors"" = very cool stuff."
3,Ehh,The stories in this collection were lukewarm. None were original or frightening whatsoever. I give it three stars because two or three of the stories were pretty good.
1,Gaiman at his worst... terribly disappointing.,"I once thought that Neil Gaiman, the master of story-telling, could do no wrong. I have been corrected. This collection of short stories leaves the reader unfullfilled. Gaiman is known for creating fantastic characters and places. Gaiman does not seem to be able to build these characters and places within the few pages of a short story. The stories in this book range from a werewolf/Baywatch story to poems about vampires to murder mysteries in the heavens. There were a few rare gems in this book, but overall, I recommend reading 'Good Omens' or 'Neverwhere' to get a good taste of Gaiman's talents. These stories were consistently disappointing."
1,not very entertaining,"I could not find any story that made me think or remember why i should read this book. I think i laughed once . Maybe it was the ""Three Billy Goats Gruff"" rewrite that left my boredom temporarily. Do not read this book if your expecting extreme or fascinating stories."
2,Not what I expected.........,"I was very enthusiastic about this short story collection, the first I was reading by Gaiman. My first book by him was Neverwhere and I just loved it, then I read American Gods and just didn't get it.......at least given the whole success it had...it just wasn't for me it seems. But S&M really didn't get my attention as I thought it would, not one short story really got me going or really made me enjoy it.( Except the one with the black cat and the very short poem about Christmas.) I hope no one gets disappointed like me on it, I just think these stories are from a very early era by Gaiman and have not much to do with his more recent style or his novels. If you're starting with Gaiman I recommend Neverwhere, I don't think you're getting anything much better than that one."
2,"a couple of gems, but most stories read like stephen king","I like Gaiman's work, but the works in this book were too slight for my liking. Many of the short stories/poems come off sounding like well-written Stephen King stories. They are either too slight, or exist merely to shock the reader with the twist ending.But there are a couple of gems (both of them the longer stories)- like ""the goldfish pool and other stories"" (a lovely and tender story mocking the LA movie business) and ""murder mysteries"" (a story about the angel Lucifer's fall), both of which are vintage gaiman.Seems to me someone was trying to capitalise on Gaiman's popularity, but some of these stories were better off left uncollected."
2,Gaiman wrote this?,"I read this book--bought it in hardcover, in fact--because I loved Neverwhere. I was surprised to find out that more often than not, the stories here are pretty annoying. Either they don't make sense, or they're just plain boring. I just finished Stardust, and it was every bit as good as Neverwhere, or even better. Guess you win some and lose some."
2,Not the same as his novels,"I read American Gods and Anansi Boys before I read this book. I looooved the novels, but I didn't care much for the short stories. I thought they were Stephen King-ish, although with less supernatural effects (and that's a good thing), but they just didn't do it for me."
3,Hodgepodge.,"Everything in here that could be considered, by a logical and well-read person, to be a short story, is excellent. Everything that is not (the ""poetry"", the vignettes, the various scratchings, the ""experimental"" stuff) is utter garbage. Pick your way through it with discretion. Nobody questions Gaiman's ability as a writer, but here he seems better suited to the sort of stuff that has a cohesive beginning, middle, and end. The nebulous, airy-fairy pieces are best skimmed past. A solid introduction to Gaiman's work, though, if that's what you're after."
2,hmm.,"i don't know about this one. admittedly, i am fairly new to gaiman's work. but stardust and neverwhere enchanted me duely, whereas smoke & mirrors has left me unimpressed. a few of the stories had me enthralled until they were through, but most i found myself quite bored with."
4,Wonderful collection,"Neil Gaiman's talent really shines in these stories, though some are better than others (at least, in my opinion, but then I think everyone here has their favorite stories, right?) and it's a great, solid collection of stories to enjoy. My personal favorites were the one about the pill that erases genetic imperfections, but also resets gender in opposite - it was a interesting and thought-provoking story - and the hundred-word story about Santa Claus. A great book to add to any Neil Gaiman collection."
5,Neil is God!,"And this collection of his short stories just proves it once again. This is a fabulous addition to anyone Neil Gaiman collection, or even just to your general fiction/myths collection.Neil has gathered in this book many wonderful and thought-provoking original stories, as well as some delightfully refreshing revamps of classic fairy tales.The book over-all does have a bit of a dark side, but for me that is refreshing from all the short story collections I've seen that are all happy and bright. Neil's masterful stories really got me hooked. I finished the whole book in a night and then immediately went back and reread it... several times.This is a book that will get worn out very quickly."
4,Great Introduction To Neil Gaiman,"If you have never read anything by Neil Gaiman, this is a great place to start. This is a mix of tales; some are humorous and others are frightening. My personal favorite is ""Chivalry"" in which an old woman buys the Holy Grail at a thrift shop, and Sir Galahad shows up trying to obtain the thing. It's like something out of a Monty Python sketch. This collection is hit and miss with more winners than losers. If you like Lovecraft, King, or Poe then give this a try."
3,Almost,"This is one of those games that could have been great. Game play is fun, and follows the story of the show rather well. Graphics are good, and it's easy to get into the game. But on the other hand the game is short...way too short. It took less the four hours to win the game. And after you win, it's done..there is no replay value. Once you found all the items and specials...which is really easy, it has nothing left to offer. As the game is, it would have been great as the first chapter of a longer game. But right now, unless you can find it for less then a dollar, I'd pass."
3,The Best of Phil Collins,"I believe that Phil Collins put a lot of heart and sould into his music. He combines instruments and voice to make an unbeatable combination. ""In the Air Tonight"" is my favorite song because of the instrumental effects at the beginning. Phil Collins The Hits focuses on love and letting go of control. In conclusion, this is why I feel that Phil Collin's album is a wonderful piece of music."
2,Very Disappointing,"I wanted quick and easy recipes for jams and jellies to give as gifts, without a a large investment in equipment. The book was very disappointing because all of the quantities are listed in pounds, not cups, and I do not want to go to the expense of purchasing a scale.. Also, nearly all of the recipes do not use prepared pectin; instead, it is required that the jam be cooked for a long length of time to reach the ""jell"" stage. Time is of the essence, for me. Therefore, I probably will not use one single recipe from this book! On the plus side, the photography is breathtaking, and the recipes are clearly written."
2,NO BELL,"Box Says there is a Bell Lionel says its a misprint! Other than that it works perfect, Thomas is made pretty good, love the fast track!"
5,Perfect,Great. We are so Happy with this set. Thank you. We had it going around our Christmas tree this year. New tradition.
4,Could be better.,our 2 1/2 year old grandson loves the train....but the construction of the connectors between the cars could be better. They are not staying together.
3,"Not bad for a longhaired, outlaw, redneck...","While DAC has better albums, this is a MUST HAVE for any DAC fan. David Allan Coe's raw style and distorted point of view are well represented on this and many other of his outlandish, yet genuine albums. DAC's music is from the heart, with no holds barred."
5,John Digweed wrote the Bible for progressive house,This is the album that launched the now immortal Label Bedrock.This first disc has Two tracks by science department (aka Danny Howells) which helped turn Danny into a world famous DJ. Just another point in the otherwise incredible life work of John Digweed.For people that no not of house music or progressive I am not sure if this would be your cup of tea.
2,A 'So-So' Album,"Did not expect this from John Digweed. Its not very exciting, simply because John attempted too hard to make it sound good."
4,Disk 2 is unbelievable!,"John Digweed is at his best on Disk2 - Perfect Trance. Unfortunately, disk one was a little too slow and housey for my taste"
5,"Not what I expected, but better than I thought.","After listening to a couple of tracks from Digweed, I was expecting something a bit faster & more melodic on this album. I found a few tracks were a little slow, especially on the first CD. Then I noticed things started picking up on track 4 ""Judy."" I think that track sets the mood for the first cd. After that, the mood just picks up and John delivers a good choice of tracks, followed by another one of my favorites ""True...""CD 2 is a bit faster & harder than cd 1. I found CD 2 spinning a lot more than cd 1 in my player.This is a great set. Anyone, fan or not, who enjoys good techno/trance music should have this in your player spinning right now.Also, check out some of the Underground stuff."
5,Heaven Scent shows just how awsome Digweed is!,"Both CDs are awsome but CD 2 is by far the better one. Number 10, ""Heaven Scent"" shows just how great Digweed is. It's one of those songs that no matter how bad your day is, it makes it better. You can't help but feel the music. Your heart beats to the rhythm, and you can't help but want to get up and dance. This song truely lets you celebrate life. This is my favorite Cd by far."
2,Where did John go?,"Before I say what I am sad to say, I love John Digweed. There's this thing he does with crowds that no other dj I know of, does. He has this way of manipulating you into a progressive oceanic state, but with unexpected and insanely welcome punches!! One moment you're traveling fast and steady, thinking he could wind everyone down (and that would be ok), but right then he hits you hard over the head with crashing energy that sends you to the moon and back... you know you're back on the ground when you hear the whole place cheering. This CD set is not that. There are one or two places that make your head bob, but overall it lacks energy. It's also creepy, dark, and depressing. I've tried listening to it several times, hoping it was just my mood, but each time I ended up feeling like I had PMS. This is definitely not one of my favorites."
3,not his best stuff,"Northern Exposure 3, BT's Movement in Still Life, Tranceport 1, Global Underground 012 and 009, Renaissance Awakening mixed by Dave Seaman. All these trance compilations are much, much better than this Digweed collection, so get those first. This stuff is alright but you have to be in the right mood to really enjoy most of it, especially CD1. Worth adding to your collection if you already have the CDs mentioned;otherwise, it is nothing extraordinary."
2,dated dance beats,"I notice most of the 5-star reviewers posted in 2000. I don't think these sets have aged very well, unlike, say GU Sydney or Expeditions done with Sasha. This is a bit too dancey and not enough trancey for my taste, if that makes any sense."
1,"Well, not really great at all","I bought this album thinking it was a trance album, before I knew the distinction between trance, and house, etc. Except for the last song on the first disc ""Bedrock"", these songs are mostly House, ie: beat music with no real melody.I tried to like it but it just isn't very fun to listen to."
3,Marginal at Best,Let me preface this by saying that I'm a big John Digweed fan. I've seen him live countless times and his song selction and mixing ability are legendary for a reason. This CD however fails to capture what I've come to expect from him. Just my personal opinion. Look to Sasha Live in Ibiza for a better time.
4,One of 1999's best albums,"John Digweed underlines the fact that he is one of Europes greatest Dj'ing talents. With big tunes like ""we are connected"", ""Ba ba"" and of course the amazing ""Heaven scent"" (wich he's produced with fellow englishman Nick Muir). The only mistake (in my opinion) is that the tunes are all a bit Lo-fi, so he will not reach a broader audience. But for all you true fans og dance music, this album is a must. Dj elusive"
5,sports car gt,perfect i mean almost this game hAS STUPID spinouts if you spin you loose it is good and bad at the same time but overall it is good.
1,yes this party going rong,this is not what is happening they lose it again and iam not happy try again spice girl wanna bees
1,Where's the glimmer of hope??,"Suzanne White's guide to love, all other books on astrology that I have read have never been so harsh to certain signs matching together. This book doesn't even give a glimmer of hope to certain matches. At least other titles offer suggestion as to why the relationship might be hard and obstacles that may need to be overcome, but they don't state that there is no hope. Every relationship is unique, this book would not be my first pick to give insight into differences in people based on their sign."
4,the adorable teddy for babies....,"My sister ordered the baby bed ensemble for her grandchild.This teddy was offered free,once you spend over a certain amount. It is absolutely adorable....Great little gift for babies..."
4,Sooo soft!,I bought this for our son before he was born. It is soooo soft and cuddly! The chenille fabric is very soft.I'd highly recommend it!
3,Janes Attack Pack,"USNF 97 would be a cool game- just like the original with more missions, better grapphics and cool sounds, but it doesn't work with Win 95 like it is supposed to. I've confirmed this with a friend on his machine and it shuts off right in the middle of a dogfight!ATF is a cool game but you have to play it through dos because the controller won't work with the dos window-patch. It has some really awesome, fast planes with some modern missles and cool campaigns, but the missions are very difficult.Longbow- theoretically, looks like a cool game, but, once again, cannot get the controller working in windows.Don't know what EA is doing about these problems, but I emailed them a while back and have not yet recieved a reply... so much for customer service.All in all, if they were to work on your machine, I would have given this a 4/5."
1,Jane's Attack Pack - very disappointing,"Potentially Jane's Attack Pack could be a very exciting and entertaining package; however, it is far from that. It is not compatable with Windows 98 or 95. While in the middle of every mission I have tried, the game will quit and you will be back on your desktop. I have Windows 98 and another review listed on Amazon.com confirms the same problem with Windows 95. Do not waste your money or time buying Jane's Attack Pack! Very disappointing, makes me very distrustful of Electronic Arts. Buyer beware."
1,Joke or Nooooooooooooooooooooo Effort?!,"I bought this around the same time I got my PC. I thouhght that I was getting a greta game. WRONG. Jane's is either 1) making a very bad joke 2) trying to make good games with scrap metal and toothpicks or 3) creating blank disks that people buy because of cover design. None of thes games worked. USNF couldn't handle the clicks on the Proceed and the Fly buttons. Apache Longbow froze every 2 seconds. ATF... oh, I dare not speak of it. If you want to get a Jane's game, get a good one, not this stinky little ""game pack"""
2,A game with laughable graphics!,"The only game I'm familiar with here out of the entire pack is US Navy Fighters 97.I bought that game brand new back in 1997 and I must admit, compared to other combat air sims of the time, this one had poor almost comical graphics!Dont waste your money on this crap!"
2,all right not great,Longbow is fun but it frezes alot.EA throws anything on the shelf.ATF dosent work for windows.USNF shuts down right in the middle of action.I would only recomend it to people who want to buy a cheap game.They spent more time on the box then they did on the games.USNF is fun when it works.
4,"An excellent, in-depth view of the White House history!",This film was very well put together. Explaining the history of the White House that has never before been documented. A must see for any history and government enthusiast!
4,Interesting & Informative,This is a nice addition to my high school government class. It is one of the better documentaries I've seen on the White House. I recommend it for anyone interested in our Presidential home.
4,odd translations of amazing ideas,"as i don't read spanish i can't comment on hurley's work, but i'm still grateful to have these works in english, even if they may have been flawed in the process.between the fantastic worlds of chinese pirates, infinte books, mirrors, single-sided objects and the ever present compasses are tender little pieces of romance and worry, and even a lovecraft story written with great affection and fun.i still worry about the world being overcome by tlon. or has it already happened?"
4,"Borges crafts magnificent, magical worlds","If you're interested in Borges' stories, this is a great book to get since it gathers all (or almost all) of them in a single binding at a great price. Borges' imagination is dazzling, and he delights in lulling readers with droll academic details before springing an unexpected surprise on us.On the down side, once you become accustomed to his style, you may grow impatient with it. Some of the stories may feel formulaic, but it's hard to fault these weaknesses when you consider that this book contains nearly his entire life's work of short stories. Some are bound to be better, and you should buy this book and read it for them."
3,Merits of Translation,"I have not evaluated Hurley's translation in any depth. Indeed, I just opened the book at random and found what seems to be a very problematic item. The Aleph (one of Borges's greatest stories, IMHO) begins ""La candente mañana de febrero en que Beatriz Viterbo murió."" I've seen this translated as ""On the incandescent Februry morning on which Beatriz Viterbo died"" and ""On the burning February morning on which Beatriz Viterbo died."" Hurley has it as ""That same sweltering morning Beatriz Viterbo died."" What happened to ""February"" which was in the orginal? I'm no Borges scholar, but this omission seems inexplicable and inexcusable to me. (Perhaps others may be able to explain it.) It also undermines my confidence in the faithfulness of Hurley's translation generally."
2,"Great writer, mediocre translation","Borges was undoubtedly a great writer, but Hurley's translation is only so-so. The di Giovanni translations are vastly better - reading them after reading Hurley's version is like seeing an ancient painting restored to its original glowing life. Hurley's translation is not awful - if it were the first form in which I had encountered Borges, I would no doubt have been delighted - but, by comparison with di Giovanni's, its clunky and rather wretched.I gather there was some sort of ugly conflict with the Borges literary estate that led to the di G translations going out of print, but used copies are readily available - the wise reader will go and find them."
3,AUDIOBOOK RIP-OFF! BEWARE!!!,"This review is for the CD audiobook of Borges' Collected Fictions. The publisher and Amazon are marketing this as an unabridged recording. NONSENSE. The corresponding book is 576 pages and constains scores of stories by Borges. The CD, on the other hand, contains no more than 15 or 20 stories. True, they are among his best stories. and are read by George Guiddell (one of the best readers in the business), but the fact remains that they are a fraction of the contents of the ""Collected Stories"" text the CD purports to represent.To top it off, after I submitted a product info correction to ""Abridged"" the moron who processed my submission amended the title from [no designation] to UNabridged instead."
4,Intelligent fiction - makes you think,"My first experience with the writing of Borges. I enjoy his ability to bring the reader into the middle of an ongoing experience - that is, to create the sense that the story had been going on long before one starts reading. My only hesitation in this review is that the translation might make his writing less accessible. I need to read the other translator to determine which I like best."
1,Disappointing,"Eau Sauvage Extreme used to be my favorite cologne. It is getting harder and harder to find. I was excited that it was available again. This bottle, however, was a big disappointment. It must have been sitting around for a long time. The oder was not at all fresh - indeed rather stale. Not attractive at all."
4,More than I expected,"I really thought this would be just about river rafting, but this goes much further. It's like a PBS program about the history and geology of Black Canyon below Hoover Dam. And (oh yeah) it has good rafting stuff too. It is beautifully photographed and wonderfully written. I learned a lot."
4,Dark and Dangerous,"A throwback to any earlier time, this dark revenge flick is filled with weird characters, dark surroundings, and murky happenings. This is true edge of your seat Grindhouse film making. Sometimes artful, often brutal and surprising, and impossible not to watch."
1,Avoid at all costs....,"This ""movie"" has nothing going for it. No acting, no plot, cheap effects, and extremely bad video quality. Maybe that was on purpose, but it was so poor, it was barely watchable. This is a huge waste of time, and am really surprised no one stepped forward to warn us all about this mega-dud!!"
1,avoid this product,"product arrived with chipped off paint, rusted parts and the predrilled holes were so off that i couldnt fit the bolts thru."
2,cheap,"The flashlight works. That's about all I can say. It's cheap, light plastic, and the cone is the same. It will work, and if it cost more than the $5 or so I spent, I would have sent it back. But ..for $5....wth."
4,Flashlight Flashlight Flash,"I use these at my local demon worshipping meetings, we hold them up and point the way to the river styx. They are great!"
2,Safety Cone Flashlight,"I was disappointed in this for the price. If I had been able to find the cones locally, I would have made my own with our flashlights and batteries (which didn't come with the product)."
4,Exactly what I expected,"This is a very basic item and it came exactly as expected. I did order 2 and there is a significant difference in brightness from one to the other, but for what I used them for, it didn't cause any problems."
4,Very Good Buy,I ordered these flashlight for a start up kit for our church parking ministry. The lights were priced great and they work well for our purpose. Thanks.
4,Java Script Book,"I used this book in a computer class, and it was very beneficial. It started off basic enough for people in the class that was not familiar with Java Script, but not too basic for others. I would recommend this book for anyone that is wanting to learn Java Script from the beginning."
2,Not So Good!,"I bought this book because I read other reviews. But I am very dispoint about this book. I realy do not know why other guys gave the book so high points! I begin to learn the Java, but this is not a good book to me at all. I found college teach books are mcuh better. Go to college to find the teach book in the subject you have interesting. The teachers have mucu more experence to select the best book for students to learn. Like ""Java Software Solution""."
5,Everything by or that has to do with *N Sync is awesome!,Everything that has to do with *N Sync is awesome! I love the way the cd is shaped as them! They look really young which they are but they are still the same guys we all love so much! Ya'll have to buy this it is awesome! If you are a die hard *N Sync fan you have to have this!
5,Northwoods gem.,"Baby quilts, pillows, carryalls, wall hangings, table toppers, mug rugs, appliqued pillowcases and seasonal stockings--and all with a Northwoods theme that's divided into seasonal offerings. There's plenty of quilt blocks, applique, and embroidery to keep your hands busy. You've got plenty of wildlife themes to choose from: bunnies, squirrels, bears, fish, deer,and chickadees. There are lakeside cabins, pine trees and cones. The illustrationsare in color, and there are directions for all the projects. A very nice book for anyone interested in quiltingthe northwoods."
1,nice but not what I was looking for,Nice book but it is applique and I totally hate all that applique! Book is beautiful and well laid out.
5,A classic!!!,"You should see the shape our Supermind is in, after five years of use. The box is tattered, the cards are bent, and a few of the shapes have been replaced with cardstock cutouts. But to my mind, this is a sign of a well-loved activity!Supermind develops spatial and planning skills, particularly if the kids put the blocks down incorrectly and must rethink how to make the picture turn out correctly. Like a ThinkFun game, the cards cover several different levels of play, so even older children will find it an engaging activity.Anyway, I still have this game and plan to keep it a few more years. My youngest still plays with this, it can keep him happily occupied for 30 minutes while I am busy with the other children.If your child enjoys this game, you might want to look at Tangrams as well. It is truly amazing how many different pictures you can create with 7 - or is it 9 - triangles."
1,disappointing,Ordered this book for my two granddaughters in college. Was very disppointed when going thru the book. Not many every day meal recipes. Most require a lot of prep time which college students are not going to do. LIke Mac & Cheese - recipe in this book takes and hour and from scratch? they can buy a box & have in 15-20 mins. Tofu sandwich? Really..how many people will fix that? Spinach quiche? How many students will cook that? Lousy book - don't waste your money. Go get Betty Crocker - can't miss with that one for only a few dollars more.
4,Great Cd,"This is one of the best Wild Cd's. With a great range of artists it makes it a truely worth wile cd to buy! I love it, play it all the time."
5,One of the great Flash stories.,"Imagine the man whose memory you wanted to honor by your actions returns from the dead...and he is disappointed in you. This is the dilemma facing Wally West when Barry Allen appears. Mark Waid invents a fascinating scenario here and by returning Golden age speedster, Max Mercury, as the guru of all the speedsters he sets up a number of stories establishing the Speed Force, from which all DC speedsters get their power. With a phenomenal twist and solid art by Greg Laroque, this one stands as one of the truly great Flash stories."
3,Barry's back.....well not really!!,"More than a decade before the actual return of Barry Allen, there was The Return Of Barry Allen in the pages of the Flash monthly. Here a despondent Wally has to try and figure out the mystery of how and why he has come back from the grave. As a reader it seems unlikely that it is Barry Allen because it only registers with Wally and few other speedster friends. I would think that a long dead hero coming back from the great beyond would have been a bigger moment. And to the time travel head scratching the plot here is a goofy but not to bad considering the time. The way a story was told then, even by Mark Waid, is so different now. Its very interesting how much time is spent each issue rehashing the last issue. The art by Greg LaRocque is amazing once again considering the time. His Flash, especially Wally is great. I loved it. Overall this is a pretty fun Flash tale with the typical early 90s goofiness!"
3,I Hate Missing Links,"The Flash: The Return of Barry Allen is well written and well drawn. Anyone who enjoys the Flash and has not read Flash 74 thru 79 will get the complete story in this graphic novel.Or will they?It seems there is a crossover to Green Lantern 40. Would it have hurt to include that story in this book? Nothing I love more than buying one comic to complete a graphic novel. If, from my tone, you get that this is not a first you are right on. This is a bad habit that both DC and Marvel have had. I can appreciate that not everything from a story arc is necessary for inclusion, but still......"
3,Wally West Beats His Own Path In The DC Universe,"After years and years of being Kid Flash Wally West is thrust in to the role of being the Scarlet Speedster because of Barry Allen's untimely death. In this story, Wally's greatest dreams and worst fears are put before him. It also has just about every speedster in DC's long history making an appearance a very good Flash tale and a nice point in the series to jump on board and get you a feel for Flash."
4,"Great Run, But a Poor Finish","His name is Wally West. He's the fastest man alive. He's the Flash. And he owes it all to his uncle Barry, the second Flash.Who knew the guy would come calling the dues?Easily the most popular story in Waid's run on the Flash, the Return of Barry Allen is a fan's dream, with meticulously researched info and an accessible story. Unfortunately, the biggest surprise isn't, and Barry's big secret is pretty easy to see coming. The final chapter also trips the line between drama and melodrama, though the opening to the final fight scene is astounding and poetic."
1,Way To Small and Over Priced,"In the first place, this thing is way too small. What can you do with it? I'll tell ya...NOTHING. It was too small to even fit around my little boys neck.What a huge disappointment. It is also cheaply made and I've found similar items at the dollar store."
2,Will the real Moxy step forward?,"A false Moxy band and only known by a true real Moxy fan. Although Michael Rynoskis vocals are clean it just doesn't fit in the Moxy mold. But then this isnt Moxy, this is a band that was left with the Moxy name and was forced by the record company to put out some radio play material. Missing the raw vocals that made the band by Buzz Sherman and founding member drummer Bill Wade shows a totally different band with a name of a hard rockin band of the past. Go to Canada or texas and any real true Moxy fan wont even recognize this as a Moxy album."
3,Moxy ~NOT!!!,This release is without the drummer and lead singer who died before this was released. There is a big difference with bill ward and buzz in the band! Even on the bands web site [...] you will see that they do not consider this a real Moxy cd!!There is no comparison of the real Moxy to this cd! Buy the original 3 cd's and the 2 come back ones which will put this to shame!
4,The Unknown Canadian Band,"This album has been a Blast to listen to, over and over. I first heard it on the Mercury Record Label, when it was released in '78. It is a solid Rock Album, from a little known Canadian Band. ""High School Queen"", and ""Under the Lights"", will blow you away. This is Mike Reno's first major vocals in a Rock Band. He went on to be a Big Hit, for the Band, ""Loverboy"". Reno's Vocals match the power in Buzz Shearman's vocals. Buzz was the original Vocalist, but died a short time before this album was made. If you want to hear Buzz on Vocals, try the ""MOXY-Self Destruction"" CD. I have been looking for this Album, since 1981. I am glad it is finally being reissued on CD."
3,the first without buzz,this was the lp without buzz shermen they say this isnt a real moxy album wouldnt know i dont have it i have the first 3 cds i dont know about this one so enuff sed so did any moxy fan know how buzz shermen died i never found out how he died buzz sings great mike reno sings great to with loveboy it dose not fit here buzz was moxy
3,Moxy Not- But Still Not Bad,I think the reviews for this album are pretty harsh No this album is not as good as Moxy's 1975 self titled debut. However there are some good tunes here Mike Reno future Loverboy singer is the vocalist here and he sounds pretty good four of the eight songs are good. Check It Out
2,Teaches kids negative self worth,"The game is a a fun game to play overall, but for anyone playing the game, when they do not achieve the goal in the level they are in, they are told that they are ""dummies"", ""useless"", ""worth nothing"", ""miserable"", ""I don't have money to pay you"", ""what you are missing is everything"", ""go and wash your face"" by the Head Zookeeper. Considering the target audience (children), why did anyone allow such degrading language in a game? A game is to be fun, and not make you feel bad. I personally feel horrible about giving the game to someone else (not just my daughter). I never would have bought it if I knew it contained such messages. Buyer beware! Not for young children, or any child/person who will be affected by negative messages being thrown at them when they mess up."
1,Not the best game out there,"It seems to me that this game was rushed to get on the market. Not only is it badly translated to english, but the game is pretty repetative and boring. The producers could have spent more time on this game or included it into an arcade style game with multiple other games. The graphics on it could have been more expirimental than just a bunch of 2-D animals and people. I have to admit that there was hardly any distortion, but what else would you expect from a new handheld? This game is definately not worth your money and if you have to have it buy it used or wait for the price to drop. Dont waste your money when you could be getting a good game."
1,This game sux,"This game sux when I got it for christmas and put it on my ds all is, is 1 puzzel game and its all about timing and rushing you when there are no matches to hit. dont get this game, get something like robots trust me!"
1,stink burger,this game was the worst game exer i would never reccomend it to anyone accept 3 year olds.
4,A Twist on~Bejeweled 2~More Games~Animals are Animated~,This is the same principle as Bejeweled 2. Moving tiles to make 3 or more in a row. Instead of jewels they are animals. When you match 3 as they burst and fly off they make cute faces. There are also different twists on the game to play which is nice. With Bejeweled it's just the same thing on and on and while that can be addicting I know I have it on my PC you do tire of it. This at least has more options.I had to wait 5 weeks for this to come in so get it when you see it in stock as it takes a long time for the supplier to get more to Amazon. It is also a great price as most DS games are twice the price.Some of the music in the background drives me crazy on a few games so I just turn it off others are okay. Overall children and adults alike can enjoy this game.
5,This is Like Crack....I Need To Play It Everyday!!!,I am addicted to this game! It is so much fun! This has to be one of the best puzzle games out there. They have different game modes you can play. I like to play the time attack version.The game is fun! It remeinds me of the game BeJewled but I like this one better because of the cute little Zoo Animals they use in the puzzle.Once again! This game is great!
3,"Great puzzle game, but not much else.","This game is an upgraded Tetris game. Your screen is filled with little animal heads all stacked up. Using the stylus or d-pad, you move these heads around and try to make a chain of at least three of the same head. There are many different modes to choose from, and there is even a two player mode. It really makes you think and brings out the puzzle player in you.There are a few cons in this game, however. The two player battle mode is very short, and there is only one mode to choose from. The game may not be the game that will keep you busy for multiple hours, but instead, a game that is better played periodically. There also isn't much of a story line, just puzzles. The game is a great puzzle game, but for players who enjoy more adventure or actiony games, this is not the game for you.Overall, this game is not bad, but not my favorite. I guess it just depends on the person playing."
4,minute waster,"It's a great game when you don't really want to get involved. Just turn on, choose the style you wish to play and go. No-brainer. It's a great game to play when you don't have alot of time to play, or you're too tired to really concentrate.Too bad you can't save your game on a certain level to return to it later.Mary"
3,Frantic,"This DVD was a disappointment. I was hoping my son and I would learn more about the Premier League and see some beautiful plays executed. We did get some of both of those things, but my overriding impression is of MTV-like frantic camera work. Instead of clearly showing a good play from several angles, they actually make the action harder to follow by using film shot through the net, speeding up the film to make it seem more active, and, incredibly, shrinking the size of the screen when showing the ""Goal of the Month."" They probably do this so you'll have a reason to buy the Premier League Goals of the Season DVD. I wish I had purchased that DVD instead of this one, but now I'm less likely to shell out money for another Premier League production because of their lame approach to the DVD I bought. I could think I five ways to make this DVD much, much better. A shame."
3,KATELAND,"This is a short color documentary made in 1950 about the PUEBIO INDIANS and their LAND. As i watched i was admireing their beautiful jewellery makeing, and the paintings that they were doing, and the pottery. But what i admired most was the architect of their houses and buildings. That did fascinate me. We were also showen a short ceremony, where you saw them preforming the War Dance, the Eagle Dance, and the Hoop Dance. This documentary is just 20mins long. And the picture quality is poor. but you are shown some interesting footage of the PUEBIO INDIANS."
4,"Thank God it's called ""Siegfried"" and not ""Brunnhilde""!","But for the Brunnhilde of Eva Marton, this recording of ""Siegfried"" would be perfect. Haitink's conducting, and the efforts of the Bavarian Radio Orchestra, are superb, as are Siegfried Jerusalem in the title role, the Wanderer of James Morris, and the Mime of Peter Haage. Kiri Te Kanawa's good German diction and musicality make her contribution as the ""Forest Bird"" very pleasing, and better than Sutherland's for Solti. Kurt Rydl is frighteningly delicious as the dragon. Again, unfortunately, Marton is dreadful as Brunnhilde, with a vibrato wide enough to drive a truck through. Yet, the Siegfried of Jerusalem, Wanderer of Morris, conducting of Haitink, and playing of the Bavarian forces, make this a recording to own."
1,Does Not Fit 2007 GTI,"While the 'Find Parts' tool states ""This product fits your 2007 Volkswagen GTI"", it does not. It's about an inch longer than the one it's replacing, and that inch is enough to prohibit it from being installed. It's not possible to open the tailgate far enough to install.Update: For 2007 GTI you want Stabilus SG301053. I purchased them from Auto Barn for ~$33. With 2 there was free shipping. Worked like a champ and far better construction than the Strongarm brand."
1,StrongArm 4329 lift too strong for 2003 Volkswagen Passat Wagon Tailgate,"StrongArm 4329 lift too strong for 2003 Volkswagen Passat Wagon Tailgate. It was a great price, but opens with so much force. I am concerned that it will eventually break the welds on the tailgate hinges. This means i have to hold onto the gate and ease into the final position. Closing: I hope you weigh more than 100 lbs and are fairly tall as this requires quite a bit of force to close. Hopefully in 5-10 years (if i still have the car) it will lose some pressure and work properly."
4,"A little intimidating, but...","At the suggestion of my 11th grade English teacher, I decided to check Nikki Giovanni out. This was the first of her books that I looked into, and as a white girl, I was intimidated. The angriest of her poems are contained in this work, but the anger is righteous. In addition to her militant poems, there are also some gorgeous ones. Though I love this book and I feel that any true fan of Giovanni should read it, I would not recommend it as a first book. Instead, pick up ""Cotton Candy on a Rainy Day"" or ""Love Poems""."
1,Should be Retitled - How to get an Eating Disorder,"I picked this book up after I had recovered from anorexia nervosa and started exercising, doing ballet conditioning, and being generally more active. They should re-title this How to Develop an Eating Disorder. So many of the 'tips' and advice in here are really 'disordered eating thoughts'. When you put this book in the hands of teenage dancers who are already at higher risk of developing an eating disorder, this could be a recipe for disaster. On one hand it says, ""Don't starve yourself!"" and on the next it says that a 5'3"" dancer should weigh 94 lbs. At 5'3"" and 94 lbs, my doctors were threatening a feeding tube! Please, pick a different book."
1,Great Comedy,This book was so entertaining I could not put it down. I laughed so hard I cried. This information is extremely outdated and rediculous. There are weight loss diets that actually recommend drinking coffee twice a day every day! Thank goodness aspiring and professional dancers have access to proper information. The Dancer's Body Book is a really good joke.
3,"Blah, Blah, Blah.","I found this book a little boring. Some interesting stuff but mainly just blah, blah, blah to me!"
4,this book cuts to the chase,"This book is quick and easy to read with a very relaxed and immediate style. Kent seems to have included her interviews with a wide range of American dancers almost word for word, so they read with an immediacy and directness that is refreshing. It is all in there - what works with weight loss, what doesn't and how hard it can be. A wonderful change from all the diet books that promise fabulous pain free results in 10 days! Some of the receipes are more useful than others, and yes, some dancers do seem to eat just lettuce and then dance for 5 hours! Ne're the less, one of the most inspiring but practical books on health and diet and exercise I have read. I really recommend it."
1,Book Promotes Unhealthy Attitudes & Behaviors,"Anyone suffering from an eating disorder should not read this book, nor should adolescents! I am not convinced that this promotes healthy attitutes toward food, body image, and weight, and could be dangerous. For those professional ballerinas who have chosen to malnurish their bodies for the sake of their professional requirements, it may have some helpful tips. As a(non-professional)dancer, and someone who struggles with anorexia, I have discovered the world of classical ballet can be cruel to the body, and constant dieting leads to a mess of medical problems, and eating disordered behaviors associated with them. I don't need a book telling me what is a dietary, ""sin,"" nor urging people to weigh snd examine their bodies each day. Healthy people are refered to as ""heavy"" in this book, as the dancer's world promotes one to be at an unhealthy weight. I returned this book, as it is toxic to me, as someone struggling with health issues."
1,The manual to become anorexic or bulimic,"This book, Dancers' Body Book, is a manual to become anorexic or bulimic. I do not recommend reading it. While I'm not in favor of banning books, if I had to go 1984 on a book this would be it."
1,Great book to help you develop anorexia,This book should be avoided by young people. My sister was given this book by her teacher and still has problems with anorexia....
3,Outdated,"This book is pretty outdated and was not written for those of us living in the 21st century. Some of it still applies, but I just find it to be something of the past. Why don't people just go to a nutritionist and follow their simple rules? For example, no white at night (e.g. breads, pastas, etc.) or that the biggest meal of the day should be breakfast or lunch. One can eat well and eat more filling foods and still stay lean and slender."
3,"A bit Outdated, but still Useful","I like this book, cause it gives great reasons to be fit and in shape, for all kinds of people (dancers, dancer wanna-be's, and non-dancers alike) It also gives lost of quotes from different dancers on their different points of view and stradegies on how to maintain a good healthy diet and physical workouts, whether that be ballet or some other kind of workout. The great thing about this book is that there are diets that are very healthy and filling, and if one can follow them successfuly than one would be sure to drop a few pounds.The only problem that I have with this book is that it is at times contradictory of what alot of the new nutritional values are, and at times it seems to me that what some of the dancers suggest, contains an underlying tone of anorexia. But hey it was written in 1984--over 10 yrs. ago, so what do ya expect?!"
1,a dancer,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. this book promotes eating disorders, plain and simple. i'm a dancer, and i have always been thin, but the ""suggestions"" this book gives are absurd. dancers are very conscious of their bodies, compare themselves to other dancers and hold themselves up to high standards. this book pretty much says that a dancer who is 5'3"" should be 94 pounds. this is so messed up. the book suggests a diet of 1200 calories a day. look at the titles: ""why a dancer should diet: you can't hide anything in tights"" and ""the chain around the refrigerator."" it shows a dancer ready to ""feast"" on garden products. besides that, this book was written in 1984. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."
5,Vintage Inspiration for the Baby-Boomers,"I first bought this book back in the early 80s, and gave it to my stepdaughter to help her with her weight. It took me only 25 years to replace my copy! I found myself trying to recreate the recipes and tips from memory over and over through the years. I'm so glad I was able to finally replace my copy."
2,Another boring movie,Pleasant movie but not as funny as I'd hoped for. Seems that all the movies bearing the National Lampoon stamp are not very funny. It's a shame that NatLamp has fallen on such hard times but its heydey was the '70's through the early '80's so this level of mediocrity is no surprise.
5,beautifully funny,I liked it and saw it many times. the young beautiful women (like Amy Smart) and story made it interesting and funny.
5,National Lampoons Barely Legal,wow this was a very funny movie. I laughed alot with some of the parts the characters played. another pie movie
2,THIS WAS JUST A GIRL NEXT DOOR REMAKE....,"I saw this movie a few times, it had some funny moments. Really it was just one of thoses try to remake of another movie just like The Girl Next Door. But I would not say this was the best one made, but the Girl next door was better and had a better plot that involves high buddies making a porn movie but the one guy actually gets to know the porn star and more funny stuff happens along the way in the girl next door. I thought this movie was really another stupid take on it. So What I am saying this one was ok, but there are better NL movies out there, and no one can replace the Vacation favorites...."
2,won't play,The description says it will play on vista. It would not play on my computer which has the vista ststem. I was very disappointed and unable to play.
5,Excellent Game,"This is an extremly good collection of games. I was having trouble locating most of these games and expansions in stores but this puts all of them into one. This collection has well over 100 missions. Some of you might have seen the graphics of the origional command and conquer before your computer became too good to run it. This includes Command and Conquer gold! It is the same as the origional except for two reasons. The graphics are much much better and it works with higher OS's such as Windows 95,98, and ME. This is an extreamly good package for a good price. Definatly worth getting."
2,Great games-but...,"I remember playing these games almost 10 years ago, and I really loved them. But this one does not run on Windows XP, and most nowadays computers use Windows XP. What's the point with a new release of these classic games if you are not able to play them unless you have a computer from the middle nineties? For me it was a waste of money."
2,What a waste of money,"This game is a waste of money, sure you get a lot of stuff but thats not the point. I bought this game thinking the graphics were good and there not, everything is small and not very detailed. The game runs slow and some times it freezes. I gave it 2 stars because it did come with a lot of stuff and if you are an true blue C&C fan then you can look past everything."
4,Aerial journey of ilimitable French reverie...,"It seems like I've had an extremely pulchritudinous dream after listening for ""The Sssound Of Mmmusic.""Bertrand's music expresses manifold gradations, bracing, urbane, dramatic, velvety, and also modish. All in all, it's distinguished with molto odoriferous arias.Bertrand has a bland, nay a palatable bariton that grows on the listeners. ""Cris Metal"" and""Coeur Inapaise"" are both the consummate ones in this album."
1,Role Model for All of Us,"The autobiography of Chief Plenty-Coups is a fascinating account, not just of Plains Indian life, but of the rise of a leader who was brave, honest, and fair in all aspects of his life. Here was a man who learned to compromise and build a consensus when acting for his people. This should be required readng for all children, and for any adult who has aspirations as a leader of children, of a community, or a nation. If physical prowess and aggressive territoriality are really to be the hallmarks of our society's heroes, then let us have a role model that adds to those qualities expert diplomacy and a deep caring for the nation's children. That this book is in his own words makes it more powerful and persuasive. While this edition does not have the illustrations of the 1935 school text edition, it does have photographs, a map, and background information about Plenty-Coups' life and importance in our nation's history."
2,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix PC Game,"I couldn't wait until the game finally came out, but I am very disappointed. First, I had trouble installing the game. I went online and did everything that they told me to do, and I still could not install the game. Then I called EA, and their customer service leaves something to be desired. In desperation, I called one of my friends who is a video game geek. He walked me through changing the registry of my computer, and then it installed.This game is not for small children, because it is very difficult to move Harry around. The camera in the game seems to always be in the wrong position. Getting 100% Discovery points in all the locations without some hints off of EA's website is almost impossible. The last couple of Harry Potter PC games were much more exciting than this one!"
5,Best Game I've Ever Played,"This is the best game I've ever played. The video game has nearly flawless graphics that make me thankful I am running it on a PC. It is fast, fun, and, much like New York City in Spider Man 2, there is not a single area in Hogwarts that you cannot travel. I have spent hours upon hours playing this terrific game. Don't listen to the other negative comments- this game is Perfect. :)"
1,Very bad character movement,"I have played every Harry Potter game that has come out. This is by far the worst. The characters are very hard to control. Sometimes when you want Harry to walk one way, you may have to press different directions to get him to go that way. In addition, it is very hard to point him in the right direction to do any spells. I gave up about 20 minutes in to the game. The cut scenes are also way too long and way too frequent. I'm not sure who tests these games but I can't imagine anyone being really comfortable with the controls."
1,Umm....,"Probably the worst gameI've ever purchased, all you do is run around hogwarts trying to find your way lighting tourches. There's no action of any kind and all the puzzles are ridicliously simple, the game gets repetitve real fast. The few duels in the game that you have are totally ridiclious since you don't even have health points, so you don't die. It's simply a horrible piece of junk, don't buy it, its not worth it."
1,Failure again,"Once again EA creates a visually beautiful game that is unplayable. You spend most of your time running around trying to make the characters use spells with controls that are horrible. The first three games didn't have great graphics but did have ease of control and movement and were fun to play. Since then, with the release of Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix,the games are very pretty but the ease of control and movement are terrible and the game play is frustrating. EA reached it's highest point in HP series of games with Prisoner of Azkaban, its all been downhill from there. Don't by this game it completely sucks."
1,Buyer beware,"I probably will never know if the game is enjoyable or not because it simply will not load, and my Win XP system exceeds the specs that EA said are needed. EA tel support is nonexistent - after going through their automated call screener, you get a message announcing office hours, and that those offices are now closed for the day (even though it's 1 1/2 hours prior to the stated closing time.) I see now why this product has been so heavilly discounted.Stick with one of the first 3 titles, buy GOF if you must, avoid OOTP like the plague!"
2,A little boring,"Not too goal directed. Too much running around without being positive of the purpose. Unable to discern the list of DA prospect and the mouse control for running is very ""loose"" all over the place bumping into the other characters, walls, staircases. Not enough to do and a lot of running long distances for little or nothing. Spells do not work well and are disjointed in selection. The first two games were fun, the last too...not so much."
5,SUPERB,"NOW THIS IS MORE LIKE THE HARRY POTTER GAMES OF OLD. THE GOBLET OF FIRE WAS SUCH A LET DOWN BUT NOW WARNER BROTHERS HAVE OUT DONE THEMSELVES WITH THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX. JUST WISH THEY COULD GO BACK AND REDO THE GOBLET OF FIRE WITH THE SAME FORMAT.THIS NEW ORDER OF THE PHOENIX IS THE BEST EVER. THERE ARE MORE HOURS OF FUN HER THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE. ONCE YOU GO THROUGH THE WHOLE GAME ONE TIME YOU ARE READY TO START A NEW GAME ALL OVER.SUBERB, EXCELLENT ON ALL COUNTS."
5,harry potter order of the pheonix (video game),"i thought this was a dvd when i bought it, not a viedo game. i gave it to my great grand daughter for christmas. she likes it very much. rbw i did not play this game so i cannot rate it"
3,It OK for old game.,"This game is really complicated and really hard. It not hard about fighting, but it hard to find everything that DA Army request. I can't find it so I need to watch video and play along with it. If you a fan of Harry Potter it ok. But if you just like an action game, I'm not recommend this game."
3,Mixed opinion,"This product did not work with 98 for us as advertised. Had to upgrade my daughters computer to XP. (Not a terrible thing, just wish I would have known that before I bought it - I probably would have looked at a different game). My daughter enjoys it very much!"
3,Wrong platform in Amazon product listing,"Despite what Amazon lists in their product listing (98/2000/XP), this game requires XP or Vista.(The above review sat here for several weeks with no impact. Then I decided to click on the ""Update Product Info"" link which I hadn't seen earlier. Amazon immediately modified the product description. Too late to help me, but maybe it'll help someone else.)"
2,A Disaster,"I have been a fan of the Harry Potter game series since the beginning. While I quite enjoyed the first three games, the last two have been a let down. Firstly the biggest complaint I see is that the controls are awkward. I agree with this but when you are involved in the game it is easily looked over. The thing that really bothers me is the fact that if you are a person who has not read the book or seen the movie you will have no idea at all what is going on. Most times when an event happens it is assumed you already know the story. Nothing at all is explained and most things are left open-ended. There was no effort put into making the game understandable to those who have not read the book. Also in this version there are no classes to go to or mini-courses to complete, you just have a few O.W.L. challanges. If you are a fan, by all means buy this game, but if you have not followed the series, don't waste your money."
2,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"My daughter had been waiting and waiting for this game and was very disappointed when it wouldn't run. My husband and I tried everything we could do to get it to run and were ready to return it. I read lots of info on the internet and saw that we were not the only ones having difficulty. Eventually, a computer friend came over and spent about an hour getting it to work and my daughter loves it. However, I am very disappointed in EA for releasing a game that has such a big flaw in it. I'm sure consumers would rather wait than get a product they can't use. We'll wait longer and do more research before we buy another of their products."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!,"We have have had so many problems with this game that it hasn't been worth the handful of times it has worked right. If you actually manage to get it working, you get so frustrated with trying to maneuver through it that you don't end up having much fun.Save you money or buy games 1-3."
3,Disappointing...,"Figuring out the puzzles and playing Wizard Chess is fun, but there's no real fun it. Just about everything is too easy. It's not even difficult on the HARD setting. Hey, game developers! Less talk, more action!"
5,Good,I hated how Janet's friends treated Janet as if she was a good friend. Janet treated Jessica and the rest of the Unicorns like dirt. Janet has a serious attitude. This story shows you what a friend really is.
1,It totally stunk!,"If I could, I wouldn't give it any stars! It stunk, and Janet was a total jerk. Nobody treats their friends like that, and if I were Jessica, I would tell that ugly, big nosed witch off!!!!!!!!! Very stupid!"
4,Witch with A capital B,"Janet is being the most horrible pain in the world,I hate her,even worse than Ellen and Ellen is usually the worst,that snot-filled little cow.Anyway,to spite her Elizabeth and Lois decide to throw a party on the same night as she,Janet,is having one.Ok?Bye then."
5,Excellent experience of online shopping,I wanted to buy a book I heard about amazon in my class so I just go on amazon and check price of book. Price was less than my college bookstore. Also they delivered on time. Overall I can say amazon is excellent!!!!
1,not what i expected,"I don't know who decides the quality of the object but according to what I saw online it said very good. When I got the book the cover was torn and they could have at least tape it with clear tape but no, they used tape with lines in it and it was kind of white. I was not happy but I need the book..."
4,Good quality,"I received this book pretty quickly after ordering. It was in great shape for being a used book and packaged well in the box. I would recommend this book for anybody looking to get their pilots license. You can skip the ""Private Pilot Manual"" which is suppose to be the starter book. This book has everything a starting pilot needs plus everything for a commercial license. Save a little and skip that one, go straight to this one."
3,Outdated version,"The product itself is excellent and would earn 5 stars, however this version (2000, advertised as ""updated"") is no longer the current version. Jeppesen significantly revised the textbook in 2007 to cover current technologies such as glass cockpits and GPS."
1,New story that should never have been told,"What were they thinking? The new adventures is nothing that can be enjoyed by children or adults. The original story is wonderful, but this was such a horrible story with horrible characters, bad acting, and worse puppets. The storyline is unimaginative and tried at worse. We watched it free on demand, and I still feel like I got ripped off. Do not even bother wasting your time."
1,Not the same color as the picture,"I received this duvet cover on time but it was definitely a much darker pink than shown in the picture. The picture shows a very light beige/blush color which looks nice but the actual duvet cover is more like a rose color. I am very disappointed because I have to go to the post office now and return the thing and wait for another duvet cover. If they had just made sure to advertise the color correctly than I wouldn't have to go through all this hassle. I feel like this color would be found in a different generation home, maybe from the 50's and my style in my house is more modern."
5,Great Service,I ordered this product and did not notice that it required a 220V input. I contacted the seller and they were willing to swap it out for a 110V unit with the same specs. I was however able to get a 220V circuit into my network closet and thus did not have to return the unit. It works great with my Mac Mini server using 10.6.? as well as my Netgear NAS both devices talk to the unit via the USB interface. With spring storms on the way I am glad that I have protection for my gear.
3,cellex -c verdict still out,"I wanted a product that would be inexpensive yet effective in removing sun damaged skin on my chest area. Cellex -c applied daily has not effectively produced the results that it boasts. After one month usage, I barely see a change in the color of my sun spots. Will give it a few more months before I toss it and purchase the expensive cream suggested by my dermatologist."
3,"Uplifiting, but not informative","I have been working with spirit guides for almost 10 years. I purchased this book to (hopefully) give instruction to many friends and family members who also wish to learn to ""connect"" to their guides. While the book contains many nice writings about what Ms. Sulick's guides have told her, it contained almost no information to help a novice learn how to connect. In my experience, simply sitting down and writing as the author suggests does not work for the vast majority of people. They need something a bit more concise to guide them to the proper mental space to get the guidance they seek.If you are not experienced in working with your guides, I would recommend you start with the EXCELLENT ""Extraordinary Guidance"" by Liza M. Weimer."
3,Easy enough to read,"I bought this for a research paper. Its easier to read then some of the books on the subject, but still a hard topic."
5,Excellent read,Exceptionally literate work of this genre...refreshing use of political ideas and altogether timely. Complex but rewarding...
3,"Not bad for a first outing, but...","It's not a badbook, but it is not a great one either. I liked Joseph R. Garber's _Vertical Run_ much more. I felt the best part of the book was the inclusion of _On Supremacy_ as an appendix, so the work would have a feeling of foundation.Still, I should hardly be construed as criticizing. The book did keep me interested. It was an enjoyable way to spend some time. But I don't think it's anything particularly groundbreaking."
5,Finally a woman in a thriller who runs the show,"I loved this book, but not for the obvious reasons. Yes it's well written and the plot is really exciting, but what I liked most was the fact that a woman, Sarah Trent, is the James Bond of the story. She's the one who thinks on her feet and rescues the male hero, professor Xander Jaspers, whenever he gets in trouble. She's a complex and totally believable character.Thank you Mr. Rabb for turning the tables on the usual thriller formula and showing what a woman can do. Maybe Mr. Clancy and Mr. Grisham could learn a thing or two."
2,good idea badly executed,"Unfortunate. this books starts out with some promise... the nature and relationship between power and chaos, but becomes lost in movie cliche scenes..including an embarrasing sex scene that utterly unbelievable. Maybe Raab had a good idea and then read a Ludlum novel to see how it's done. Unfortunately, Ludlum is a very bad writer. Maybe when Rabb is a little older he will write a better book without thinking how it will play in Hollywood."
3,Another conspiracy read.,"I had read the reviews of this and thought it might be worth reading. There's nothing like a good conspiracy novel to keep your attention. Unfortunately, Rabb must have called Ludlum up and asked for his writing template, but he is not as good at it."
5,Wow! The next great thriller writer has arrived.,"This book was fantastic. You hear it all the time, but I couldn't put it down, literally. At 4 am when I finally finsihed it, I couldn't believe I'd stayed up so late. I've never been someone who reads philosophy or old political manuscripts, but Mr. Rabb made the theory of ""On Supremacy"" so real that I couldn't help but get caught up in it. This is a great story that if you think about it, could actually happen. That's what makes it such a good book.I can't wait for his next one."
3,"Entertaining, but easy to figure out.","I picked this book up at the library after reading the description in an advertisement. It seemed, from the description to be similar in feel to the wonderful Katherine Neville novel ""The Eight.""""The Overseer"" is intriguing, and the story idea enough is to keep one going, but it just seems like a run-of-the-mill suspense thriller with a good central element, the Eisenreich manuscript. It's a quick read, and entertaining, and the characters are likeable despite being predictable. Not a bad book, but it could have been better."
3,"Great premise, fast-paced plot, shaky technique.","It's true that Rabb's ""Overseer"" is an action packed, semi-brainy thriller/spy novel. No one could doubt the intelligence of taking a manuscript which seems to detail rules for the acquisition of power and turning it into a plot to rule the U.S. Rabb goes to great lengths to create a reality based on the theories of the manuscript. And succeeds.But to me this novel is yet another example of a greatly intelligent expert in history/philosophy without a decent idea of fictive plausibility. For example, four of the settings to which Jaspers travels are, coincidentally, places Xander Jaspers himself stayed, either studying or teaching.Coincidence? you be the judge.Otherwise, though, this happens to be greatly entertaining and strong in twists that make a plot worth following. Also, of course, it ends well for the good guys--which is the best part of a spy novel."
1,Couldn't finish this book!,"I ordinarily enjoy 'thrillers', but this one was terrible. The characters were so poorly developed that I couldn't remember who was who. I will not be reading any more by this author."
4,Very Good,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I however do not find it that far-fetched, since that in and of itself is the premise of the book, that people will refuse to accept the possibility of such power until it is too late. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good book to read."
4,Classic conspiracy fiction,"This book reminded more than a little of Robert Ludlum's AQUITAINE PROGRESSION (among others of Ludlum's).This isn't a bad thing, as Rabb has done a nice job updating the concepts and finding new twists for them.I'd wager he's been inspired by Ludlum too, because he has the same kind of hero-caught-in-a-vast-conspiracy style that hooks you and won't let go. Plot comes fast and furious (a little too fast actually, the multiple characters all start to blur) and I was swept into the story.A nice first outing for Rabb. If he keeps this up, he could be quite a thriller writer the 2000s (or whatever the heck you call the next decade)."
4,The Head Over Heels companion EP,"While some newer Cocteau Twins fans place Sunburst & Snowblind pretty low on their ""favorites"" list, there are a couple of wonderful tracks on this EP: From The Flagstones and Because Of Whirl-Jack. In fact, back in the days of vinyl this EP was highly sought after, mainly for Because Of Whirl-Jack.This EP and the Head Over Heels album are sold as 2 separate titles as well as 1 combo title these days. I always tell folks they shouldn't have Sunburst & Snowblind without Head Over Heels and vice versa."
4,Mindless droning....,"It's funny, I got this import for $3.25 at some used record store.Anyhoo Rufus, I highly recommend this little treasure. Only a couple of tracks, but it is highly worth it. There is a slightly different version of Sugar Hiccup in this one oppose to the one of Head over Heels, there is somekind of backing vocals or it could just be a reverb effect. The last track is very jumpy, but also very memorable.Have fun with this release.~Adios."
2,only 1 not 3 as shown in picture,When I bought the basswood practice block. I assumed it came with 3 blocks as shown in the pictures. imagine how surprised I was when there was only 1 block in the package.
1,Major Ripoff,"Are they kidding? $3.50 for one block?If you want to carve using basswood blocks, check out Rockler's assortment right here on Amazon or go directly to their website."
2,disapointed,"Upon looking at this item (the picture) and reading about it I expected to recieve 3 pcs of wood. Upon reciept of this product I was quite disapointed to find only one practice block,even though the pcs of wood is of good quality. After going back to the web sight and reread what it says, ""BASSWOOD PRACTICE BLOCK"". This is another case when a buyer must be careful of being decieved by what you see and assume this is what you are getting. Plus I could have purchased this local and spent the same including the amount of gas I used."
4,great compliation,"this dual compilation from DAC is a good one. has a few of those down-home feeling songs, good fiddlin', and a honky tonk feel."
5,Prayerfully written book,"This book uses some of art from Karla's previous books but with different meanings attached. It is a great gift from one woman to another to express feelings better than a simple card. It will be read more than once and kept longer than a card. The only trouble is, you hate to give it away. It is a good reminder to pray more than a simple few sentences. I wrote a note to say I prayed through the book for my friend (and I did). My mom thought it was a little too wordy but I like words as well as the art that goes with them."
4,Zen and the art of aircraft maintenance,"I'm not entirely sure that there is a ""typical"" Shute book, but this one is both typical and atypical. It is typical in that it is mostly about post-WWII era aircraft operations, and rather more intense on the aircraft angle than most of his other books. Also, like several of his other books, it pokes about at the meaning of morality.On the atypical side, ""Round the Bend"" is somewhat alegorical and ""preachy"" in the same sense as ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"". In fact, I'd be willing to bet that Robert Pirsig read ""Round the Bend"" before he wrote ""Zen"".Folks comfortable with Shute's writing will find that ""Round the Bend"" has his trademark writing style -- spartan, yet with a delicious amount of descriptive detail, intense, yet without an identifiable climax. As usual, he's not given to plot twists, but rather focuses on the development of human character and the way it plays out under unusual circumstances."
5,Shute's best,"Round the Bend is Shute's masterpiece. A cross between The Right Stuff and Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, it has a powerful universe of its own, like Dune's, which is hard to forget"
4,"Better than the ""stuck in a groove"" reviewers say it is.","I have nine Guano Apes CD's. Certainly the ""Planet Of The Apes"" has the cream of the crop, which is where I would point ANY first time buyer of the apes. BUT if you already know & like the apes, BUY ""Don't Give Me Names"", simple as that. There are MANY tunes on it that appear on their best hits, so SOMEBODY liked them. I have an unusually wide spectrum of musical interest. I LOVE ""Quality"" wherever it may be found. My collection also includes, Tapping The Vein, Die Happy & Lacuna Coil. I even like The Lords Of Acid once in awhile. As of late, Whenever I feel the need for un-leashed raw female power & expression, I reach for ""Planet Of The Apes"", it Frosts My Cake. Expand to other Guano Apes CDs Like DONT GIVE ME NAMES, AFTER you've experienced them. Breathe in the aroma, kick the turds around awhile, get to know Land Of The Apes, FIRST. However there are GOOD tunes here not found on their best hits CD."
2,Not as Rocking !!!!!!,"I am a big Guano Apes fan. When this CD came out I had to get it. But, I notice right away that this CD is more poppy then there first one. This CD does have some cool multimedia stuff on it though. Only real good tracks are ""Big Japan"" there first single, ""Dodel Up"", ""No Speech"", and ""Innocent greed""."
4,I disagree!,I totally disagree with the previous review. You can't review a game with today's standards when the game was published several years ago. I really like the range of guns to choose from.
5,Great Rock & Roll From the Late 1960s,"I was lucky enough to see this concert live. The producers put together a group of terrific musicians and music from the peace movement of the 1960s.The final mix in this DVD is incredible and includes the last performance of the late Buddy Miles (Jimi Hendrix's drummer).This DVD is a collector's must.Stan CrawfordAustin, Texas"
5,What an honor to see the last performance of the late Buddy Miles,"This DVD really captured some of the true essence of the 60's. The performances were all solid and it is amazing to see where many of our musical roots came from. Most of the songs helped define that ""Summer of Love"" and for guitar players it is a must see. It is fascinating hearing the performers describe what it was like during this period. I saw Jimi Hendrix in 1968 at Swing Auditorium in Riverside California. Eric Johnson's performance of ""All Along the Watch Tower"" was so masterful and dead on, that if I closed my eyes I thought I was in the presence of Hendrix again. No other performer has ever covered Jimi so flawlessly. His guitar tone was amazing. A real treat in surround sound.K. Austin"
3,Well.. not bad!,"The time for delivery was respected, although I must say that it was quite long. But, since I live in Italy I may think it's normal such a time. As far as quality is concerned, the product arrived quite ok, a part from some little signs of the travel (the box was a little ruined as if it had received some strokes during the travel...). The dictionary was ok: it had some ""damages"" though, but I may presume it's due to the editor, because also in normal bookshops the dictionaries look just like that (or even worse..). The price was perfect: I saved something like 15 on the item even though I had to pay for the delivery."
2,Expecting more from scooter,"I always thought 'Back to the heavyweight jam' was crap, but this cd has proven me wrong. Hardly any good songs what so ever. The single 'I'm your pusher' is probably the best song on the cd but not any good compared to scooter's earlier work. I myself am a big scooter fan and i own all of their albums, but this is just bad. If you wanna listen to good german dance music i recommend scooters earlier albums like: 'No time to chill', 'Wicked!', 'Our happy hardcore', '..And the beat goes on', 'The age of love' and their singles album; 'Rough and tough and dangerous'. Buy one of these instead of 'Sheffield' and their second newest album; 'Back to the heavyweight jam'."
1,Slip 'N' Slide: All Star Weekend,"I got this because I am an R. Kelly die hard fan, but video stinks."
2,Disappointing,"Honestly, I bought this DVD based on reading the reviews on this page. This movie was very disappointing and basically, not for me. Granted it probably was hilarious to a bunch of people but I wasn't one of them. I laughed out loud maybe two or three times and it was all in the first 10 minutes. Everything is down hill from there. They shouldn't have even bothered to have a plot in this movie. All in all, my advice to anyone looking to buy this is to rent it first."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Vastly overrated by many a frat boy, Super Troopers is neither great nor inspired, but it does offer a couple big laughs in between long moments of tedium."
1,Never got it,All I got was an empty dvd case so I can't really give a review. I will not buy from this seller again
2,It tried so hard but still remains to be wack!!!,"The fact that this movie would be in the comedy genre is stupid because it crosses the zany and spoof genres and it has no plots. If you've watched 'Dumb & Dumber' or 'Boat Trip', you'll be familiar with this movie. State trooper is an offensive, stupid 'comedy' and just practically shows us a day in the life of red neck state troopers.This movie had some good parts but most of the scenes are just to annoying to watch and they killed the comedy by blabbing about weed jokes and models. A very low budget movie, no star cast and can't even be called a comedy, waste of time."
2,Not region free :(,"I bought this hoping that it would play on my PS3 as the PAL version isn't available anywhere, believe me, I've been on the lookout for a long time. I love the movie and was really looking forward to checking out all the extra features, but unfortunately it's locked to region A.Lets hope it gets an international release soon!"
1,A Rating of Zero Not Allowed,"If a zero rating were allowed, that is what this poor excuse for a comedy would get. I love comedies and have seen few I did not like a great deal... this is one of them. Even saying I smiled a few times would be a stretch... It is so poorly written that I do not know how a studio could make it. Considering this, the actors did the best they could, but it was a hopeless disaster after a great opening scene. It goes downhill from there all the way into the septic tank."
2,Not quite frat house funny.,"It was funny in spots, but more of it was 'uncomfortable' funny - like a bad 'I Love Lucy' episode. Compared to real 'frat style' comedies like ""Police Academy"", ""Airplane"", ""Porky's"", ""Revenge of the Nerds"" or ""Animal House"", this movie is like a production written, produced and performed by a high school drama class. The opening scene (which is a rip off of an old ""Cheech and Chong"" routine) showed a lot of promise, but the rest of the movie couldn't keep up. But this movie does show how rock bottom Lynda Carter's career has hit. I'm glad I borrowed it before I put down hard earned cash to buy it."
5,Hilarious,"Okay, it does LOOK dumb. I didn't think I was going to like it at all, but it was the only thing playing by the time my friends and I made it to the movie theater...so, I watched it. Thank God! Super Troopers is absolutely hilarious. It's the funniest movie I've seen in a long, long time. The writing is extremely funny and the acting was top-notch, especially for a bunch of guys I hadn't seen act before. This film is definitely on it's way to being a cult classic. I, for one, just ordered the DVD and will be anticipating the moment when I can invite my friends over, pop it in the DVD player and light one up. ;)"
3,"""Hey thats my car... and my (gulp) Girl!""","This is a great silly goofy movie for the whole family (17+) It has some memorable things and qoutes that will remember. The reason I rated it a three is because it could've been better. The humor was great when it was around but most of it was a little dry if you ask me. A few choice moments made this movie see worthy. I don't know most of the people on this cast and I don't know the people that made it but I heard the same producers are making ""Club Dread"" and that looks like it is pretty funny as well. So if you want to watch this movie and you appreciate this kind of humor ok... but if your just gonna watch it because you think this will be a great movie watch and you don't usually don't watch these kind of movies then watch something else. Ok peace I'm out!"
4,"Broken Lizard, watch them climb to superstardom!","Here Broken Lizard are with their first mainstream production from Fox SearchLight. This movie was a huge smash at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival however, with low commercial exposure and public interests following world events during the theatrical release, this movie never saw its full boxoffice potential. Now at second chance (home release), many will discover the comedic genius Broken Lizard has to offer with 'Super Troopers.' Rolling, continuous laughing while watching the flick and jokes remembered days after viewing will urge you to watch it again. Aside from the excellent performance of the Lizard five, casting was superb. Look for a hilarious reference to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Jay Chandrasekhar is a director/actor who could quite possibly gain great notice in the near future. I look forward with great antisipation to the next movie in Broken Lizards inventory 'Club Dread.' 'SuperTroopers,' a must have in your home collection"
5,Not for cardboard cutout types,"If you're the type that finds Nathan Lane or the sit-com ""Full House"" funny, you can skip this flick and get yourself something like Mousetrap or any Billy Crystal movie. It's just not going to work out, and I don't mean to be offensive.If you are ""with it"", however, I must say that Super Troopers is right up your alley. This is truly one of the comedic gems of the past decade. Broken Lizard are terrific and each member shines throughout the movie. One of the few DVDs that I've watched multiple times within the first week of ownership. I'm not surprised that this was not a mainstream success but I just hope that it was successful enough that we can see more from the Broken Lizard team."
3,Worth watching once,"Not a terribly hilarious movie as I had anticipated, but it's alright. I still prefer the Police Academy series which were hilarious at their time, and to some extent still are. This one's along the same lines though there are is a trashy feel to it. Worth a watch once for a chuckle, that's about it for me."
5,Funny!!!,"This is one of the funniest movies around. If you haven't seen it, you must see it. There is no other choice!!!!"
5,I WANT A LITTER OF COLA,this movie is great. it makes me laugh every time i watch it. the state troopers station is getting shut down if they don't start getting business taken care of and they are full of shenanigans! i wish cops were really this much fun.... they see how many times they can say meow to the guy they pull over. one trooper tackles the kid at the fast food place for messing with his drink. They mess with some stoner kids that they pulled over. i recommend this movie if you enjoyed super bad or role models or step brothers.
3,"Good movie, old blockbuster movie","I was really excited to see this movie for such a low price. I was a little disappointed to find that the movie was not brand new. In fact, it is a movie from a blockbuster store. Do yourself a favor and buy from a different vendor."
3,"Great movie, but not any better on Blu","I guess the picture is a little sharper, but it seems like the screen is zoomed in to get the 16:9 ratio."
5,Super Troopers is AWESOME!!!,"These guys are hilarious! We watch this film over and over and my husband and son say the lines even before the actors do - which was annoying at first, but now it is like a game, and I've joined in the fun!!!littering and?littering and?littering and?or, Liter a cola! or Car RamRod!I Love this movie! We saw these guys in Chicago and had a chance to talk to them after their show. They were funny, and they were friendly! I'd love to have them over to my house to party!"
5,spot on,"i remember seeing this movie in theatres, and quite frankly it's one of only a handful of films that have accomplished to make me cry in public...oh so funny"
3,It's Okay - Not For Everyone,"it's a silly, goofy movie. some parts made me laugh. i think teenagers would think this movie was a blast."
5,Proof that you don't need a big budget to make a good movie,"I bought this DVD on a whim, and I couldn't be happier. This movie is just plain funny. Sure it isn't exactly high class comedy, but for someone like me (a broke college student) its perfect. The characters are very distinct, but they mesh well together. The broken lizard crew are all buddies and it really shows on this film.The gags are really well delivered. Some could have been really tasteless, (like the bear""lover"" scene), but broken lizard knew just how far to go.The DVD itself also contains some great extras. Comentary by all the broken lizard members, as well as deleted and extended scenes w/ optional comentary, outake reel, and a featurette on the film. Overall a great buy."
1,Wow this was bad,"After a recommendation from a friend, it still was NOT worth the $2 I paid to watch it. Reassessing my friends. :)"
3,some of this isn't funny if you are on the recieving end,"As police comedy movies go this is kind of outrageous?Some of the stuff is pretty funnyif you think ofcops as having an 85 IQ?But most of us hope and pray they don't!I liked the pretty blond cop, but these troopersare just a failure to be really funny for me.I enjoyed the movie anyway."
5,One funny movie,"You have to admit, when you first saw the preview for this movie it looked too incredibly stupid to pay 8 bucks to watch. But one day my brother came home and told me how funny it was, so I went a watched it and he was right, there was not a moment in this movie where I wasn't laughing like crazy. Some of the pranks and games they play in this movie are classic and you'll be talking about it for days. You can rent it if you want, but that's just wasting money because you'll want to go buy it anyway."
2,Some Funny Parts.......,"I thought this movie would be really funny, it wasnt. there were some good parts but overall it was trash. the acting and production was very good, but i suggest you give this a rent or borrow from a friend. ..."
2,I'm probably the only one who hates this,"I usually like senseless comedies, but this movie is junk. Pure, pointless garbage. This movie starts out funny, but it starts steadily declining until it's rapidly going downhill. It goes from hilarious to being just short of something you would burn as a fuel source. It probably wouldn't burn well either if it can't stay funny for more than the first half hour. I almost did not enjoy this movie at all. I only found the first 30 minutes entertaining. The rest of it is TOO senseless and TOO pointless. Some of the scenes make NO sense at all(like the naked doll on top of the police car near the end, and part where those two people are jumping on the bed doing SOMETHING and the guy keeps fussing at them). This is senseless trash. Rent it if you still wanna see it and have an opinion of your own, but make sure before you waste your money on this garbage."
3,Average troopers,"This movie was written and performed by a comedy troupe known as Broken Lizard which explains why the movie seems like a series of sketches pasted together with filler material. The guys play very bad highway patrolmen who are trying not to lose their jobs. The jokes are scattershot. Some will make you laugh out loud until you can't breathe, some will emit a chuckle and many others will just sit there and go nowhere. This is a decent comedy but not one that will have you laughing non-stop."
1,Terminally BORING...!,"I don't mind dumb movies and I can even snigger at a lame joke... but one thing I cannot abide is terminal tedium. I couldn't even finish this movie. My copy came in a 5-dvd set along with 'Borat', 'Dodgeball', 'Shallow Hal' and 'Me, Myself & Irene'. These were very amusing to various degrees but 'Super Troopers' was a total stinker from the get go. If you want stoner comedies then get some Cheech & Chong or Firesign Theater's ""J-Men Forever""... even ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" (if you must) but stay away from THIS turkey. Honestly, the only joke in it is the one on you if you sit through this stupid excuse for a comedy expecting to find a laugh."
5,Farva's number one!,This movie is a total surprise and one of the funniest in years. I saw it in the theatres and loved it. Now that it is on dvd I am on a mission to get everyone who has not seen it to see it. Freaking hillarious! Buy this movie right meow.
2,"Not quite funny, entertaining, or clever enough","Besides the opening and ending scenes, this movie is full of mediocre one-liners and wacky antics that just aren't funny enough to warrant an hour and a half of your life. That, along with the meaningless story line, leaves very little to redeem this movie. Don't waste your time unless this is your flavor of humor."
4,Almost as funny as it is stupid...,"""Super Troopers"" is almost as funny as it is stupid, and I've got to tell you, it's a pretty funny movie. It's the first movie that's made me laugh out loud repeatedly in the theater since ""Best in Show"".The screenplay is almost non-existant, but as Bill Murray once said in ""Meatballs,"" ""it just doesn't matter."" What makes this quirky movie work is the unresistable funniness of its cast. Kevin Heffernan, as Farva, is particularly funny. In his better moments, he's almost as naturally funny as ""SCTV""-era John Candy. And that's saying a lot.My all-time favorite comedies are the great ones of the late seventies and early eighties I grew up with as a kid--""Stripes,"" ""Caddyshack,"" ""Vacation,"" ""Animal House,"" ""Porky's,"" etc. I saw some of the wild exuberance of those movies in ""Super Troopers"".Yeah, it's a stupid movie, but if you've got the right kind of sense of humor, it's a stupid movie that will make you laugh...very hard. What's better than that?"
4,"Great movie, awesome P-I-P Blu Ray commentary!!","Looks great in Blu Ray. Especially interior scenes.The new PIP commentary is worth the price of upgrading to Blu Ray alone.If you like this movie, buy it!BTW I knocked off one star since I think the movie is a little too long and less of the funny bits during the last 45 minutes where they focus on the criminal stuff."
3,Hit and miss,"Comedic group Broken Lizard crafted this farce about Vermont highway patrol men pulling frat like pranks while duking out a rivalry with the local police force. Super Troopers is far from sophisticated comedy; many of the jokes miss, but when they hit it ends up being hysterical. The comedy troup (consisting of Jay Chandrasekhar, Kevin Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter, and Erik Stolhanske) does terrific ensemble work, and the casting of Brian ""the original Hannibal Lectar"" Cox as their long suffering superior adds another layer of comedic greatness and he seems to be enjoying every minute of his role. All in all, Super Troopers isn't the best recent comedy to hit lately, but it is definitely worth seeing."
4,Accurate Police Flick,"This is a great movie that I would say is fairly accurate in the types of things cops do to have more fun in their job. I'm not saying they do these exact things, they just aren't all hard-nosed or trigger happy. Having said that, I think the movie loses some of its comedic steam about halfway through. It seems once Farve gets out of dispatch and the competition with the city department picks up I found myself laughing less-and-less. I would still recommend this to fans of slapstick comedy and police movies though."
5,Humerous,Cannot stop watching this movie. The best part is there really is no story line and that it is 100% jokes throughout.
5,Super-Super Troopers,This is a great movie. Watch and decide for yourself. Test 1: If you don't laugh in the first five minutes you might not have a sense of humor.
5,super troopers rocks,"This video is a must for anyone in law enforcement. It shows your how the job should really be done. Littering and, littering and, littering and..."
4,Take A Chance on this Film,"When this movie first came out in theaters, it looked funny, but i never took myself to the theater to see it. My friends who did see it said that overall, the funny parts were in the trailer. So, taking my friends advice, i waited until DVD to see it.My friends couldn't have been more wrong about anything. This movie, from start to finish, was laugh out loud hilarious. All five of the members of Broken Lizard were funny as hell. There is a plot, but the you will never be thinking about the plot because you will be too busy composing yourself from laughing so hard at a joke.Take my advice. Go BUY this movie. Forget renting it, you will want to own it when you finish watching it."
2,i need no subject,"i only give this 2 stars... it was funny at times (at times)must of this film was d.o.a besides the intro,i did love the intro. if you could not predict the ending of this film your a dumb ass.. see it but dont buy it!"
1,Astonishingly Bad on Every Possible Level,"If this movie was like most horrendous comedies, it could be dismissed for its lame jokes and complete lack of timing along with its bad acting.But it really distinguishes itself by having NO POSSIBLE CONNECTION to the real world or law enforcement or anything. Do they know ANYTHING about the police or highway patrolmen? Apparently just recycling the Delta vs. Omega scenario from ANIMAL HOUSE while putting everyone in uniform is enough.I don't know which world would find this movie funny, but it ain't this one."
1,I refuse to take responsibility,"for renting this awful movie!!I didn't laugh once in this moronic movie.This is strictly for men between the ages of 17 and 23, or fans of ""dude where's my car""...which could relatively be close to the same audience.I am a grown woman who appreciates comedy, and this was not funny. It was poorly written and poorly acted. It could have at least been camp, but it wasn't even that.It's just a total waste of film.Stay away from this one!I don't recommend it at all. I'd recommend ""Police Academy"" over this, and i didn't even like that all that much.Eileen Famiglietti"
1,This could be the worst movie I've ever seen.,"In this day of high ticket prices, I feel it is necessary to watch the entire movie. However, this movie was so terrible, that I left 3/4 of the way through it. The humor was below any intelligent level, and the plot was virtually non-existent. I would say avoid this movie now, and tune out when it comes out on cable in 2 months."
3,Chuggin' Syrup,"The first 15 minutes of this film are worth watching even if you don't watch the rest. Three pot smoking teen travellers get the works from two officers with a bizarre sense of humor. Comedian Jim Gaffigan does a short scene where he is being harrassed by two Super Troopers. There's just too much funny stuff going on in this movie to watch just once. Law enforcement types really seem to get a kick out of it, too. Just think of autoasphyxiation in a patrol car to an image on a billboard and if you think that is funny you will love this film."
5,puts the fun in funny,this is by far my favorite comedy movie ever...knee-slapping humor keeps the movie fresh and you never lose it. worth whatever amount is asked to see it.CS112_kjs7
3,Disappointing...,I find it funny that I thought Kung Pow was going to be lousy and that this would be funny. Well in reality Kung Pow had me rolling and this film barely made me chuckle. The biggest downside was most of the laughs come in the first 20 minutes or so. I did find the film amusing in ways but it just ever lived up to it's potential. I thought some of the jokes could have played out better. The acting wasn't bad though considering the writers played all the major parts. It was a smile inducing romp through a wacky copland but the actors just couldn't sell the big laughs well enough.
2,Blooper Troopers,"This is the story of a team of obnoxious Vermont Highway patrolmen and their struggles to keep their jobs, prevent boredom, and goof off.I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, after viewing the trailers, but the truth is... I found this movie embarrassing.I was unable to connect with any of the main characters, because they were constantly trying to outdo each other with gross-out humor, drug-smoking, drinking while driving and thinly veiled sexual innuendo... And these characters are cops!I think the screenwriter must have intended this behavior to be amusing. But instead it was just embarrassing.Super Troopers just went too far. The only funny bits, seemed to have made in the trailers. Rental Fare at best...."
4,hilarious,"i dont think that people gave super troopers enough credit as it deserved, it was a student film that barely pulled it off, and it was hilarious!!! super troopers is about a ragtag group of highway patrol men that have 2 save their station from being shut down by a bunch of other policemen. a hilarious nonstop movie!"
2,Overrated,"Terrible movie. The movie is not funny at all. There is only about two jokes in the entire movie. This Police Academy wanna be just doesn't cut it, and will never be as funny as the original Police Academy. I don't even know why they are making Club Dread, I'd rather see Scary Movie. Horrible, just horrible"

1,Super Looser,"I love comedy, especially when it comes to spoofing known agencies and corporations, etc. However, I hung my head in absolute shame for the guy that produced this inane piece of garbage. My mind reels at the thought that someone actually put up the money (and it couldn't have been much) to put this atrocity of comedy on film. The acting (if there was any) was pitiful right along with the lame jokes and god awful punch lines. I only rated this as one star as I couldn't find a lower rating. Stay away from this one."
1,A WASTE OF 3 BUCKS.,"I rented this movie last night because I had heard such great things about it and it proved the old saying ""don't believe what you hear and only half of what you see."" I wanted to like this movie, but at best all I can say is that it's funny in spaces and then only mildly. It never made me laugh out loud the way the original king of cop comedies ""Police Academy"" did in 1984. Bottom line, it had potential but never lives up to it."
1,I wish I could give it zero stars!,"I usually love stoner stupid movies and was looking forward to seeing this movie. It is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. The writing is horrid and the acting is ridiculous. Save your time please!!! Rent 'Dude, Where's My Car' instead! Now thats funny!"
2,More cliched cop comedy,The best thing I can say about this movie is that at least they didn't use the cops and donuts cliche. Every other cliche was thrown in from both police movies and fraternity movies.
2,"Love the movie, just not the unbox on TiVo","Love the movie, but doing the Unbox thing on TiVo lacks. No Special Features, choppy video and no scene selection. I am glad that I got a $15 credit to try Unbox before buying anything."
4,Funny for a certain subsection of the population,"This is a funny movie if you are not sober. Drunk, stoned, whatever: this movie is better while intoxicated. The first 10 minutes are the funniest; it's all downhill from there. The story is kind of lame, but it is still funny. The humor is not as uproarious after the first scene, but it's still entertaining. Males 18-35 and college students should appreciate this movie the most."
5,Don't fall down crying.,"One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Can watch it time and time again and still crack up. Its a favorite at my high school, constantly being quoted in my classes. A great movie to watch with a group of friends. Makes you wonder what cops really do... My dad thought the movie was funny also. A must have for any teen or anyone who likes a good laugh."
3,3 stars for Amazon's crappy video quality,"Great movie, but amazon's video service is below par. The SD versions of videos are unwatchable, so i purchased the HD version and was not HD quality."
5,Classic that you can never go wrong with,"Great movie to watch, whether your high, shroomed out or even just sober. But definitely worth the $3 when you get a urge to watch super troopers."
3,super,It was one of those you have to been a little twisted to find it funny and I did don't recommend it for everyone
3,It was okay.,"My sister insisted that I needed to see this movie. There were a couple parts that made me giggle, but I probably would have rather watched it for free, instead of paying rental price for it."
5,Extremely Funny,"I'm almost embarrassed to say that this is definitely one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I'm not usually the kind of person who enjoys slapstick humor. But there's something about this movie that makes it work. The humor fits the movie. Unlike so many other movies when they try to be funny just for the heck of it. The entire movie is great. There isn't a dead spot in it. I guarantee you, you'll have a smile on your face from the drop dead hilarious opening scene, ""I'm freakin' out man!"", to the quite comical ending. This movie is loaded with one liners that you'll be saying for days. ""Smells like sex in here. What have you two been doing?"""
5,The Funniest Movie from 2002,"I felt the same way most people did when this came out in the theater. I did not want to ever go see it, and did not believe my friends when they told me it was hilarious. Just a few weeks ago, they got the DVD and we watched it. Since then, I've watched it five times and still crack up at the jokes. If you do not have a sense of humor that appreciates outright stupidity, than don't get this movie, buy Gosford Park or something. This movie is downright hilarious and everyone I know who has seen it has not disagreed with me yet."
5,BLAHAHAHAHAHA!,What a halirious movie (Super Trooper)! It's a Great Comedy Movies for any day that you need a laughs. Great movies! Hahaha....
4,Super Trip!,"Hilarious. That's all I can say. Your typical Animal House style movie, this is a perfect comedy if you're into goofy humor"
2,Mike Trout's Cycling is less than Awe-inspiring!,"Even though I am a fan of Focus on the Family, and Mike Trout was the co-host of the broadcast when I read this book, I found it did not hold my attention. His descriptions of the places he stopped could have been enlarged, as well as the people he met and the sights he saw. He was accompanied by his son in law, and planned the coast to coast route which was not necessarily the easiest, but one which passed through Colorado, home of Focus on the Family.I agree that this could have been a full length magazine article instead of a book and certainly I would encourage readers to borrow it or check it out of the library. It is not a keeper in my opinion. Sorry Mike, I liked you as co-host, but as author, well, you are just so so."
2,Not for me,"If your looking for a inspirational book about christian faith, then this might be the book for your or if you enjoy a radio show called focus on the family.If your looking for a book about pure bicycling touring this is not the book for you."
1,"Too much religion, not enough cycling","Don't bother with this one if you want to read about his experiences cycling. Get it if you want to reinforce your Christian faith, or be converted. Unfortunately, I was interested in the cycling angle. This book is not much more than an advertisement for Focus on the Family, the author's employer."
5,GREAT COOLER,THIS WILL KEEP ICE FOR DAYS. A GREAT PRODUCT. NO PROBLEMS AT ALL AFTER SEVERAL SEASONS OF SUMMER CAMPING IN THE NORTHEAST DURING HOT SUMMER
4,Amazon.com Coleman Cooler Review,"This is an excellent cooler for camping. We went on a 3 night camping trip and used this cooler for our meat and dairy products. I froze a large block of ice to use in the cooler before we left and it kept everything cold without additional ice for the length of the trip. The temperature was as highe as low 90's during the day 0 so I expected to need to add ice. We didn't open and close it often, but the ice was not even half melted when we got home. The only drawback on this cooler is the internal space is smaller due to the extra insulation. This is a great cooler for those parishables during a camping trip!"
1,Does not do as it says,"My family was going on a camping trip and figured this would be perfect as the ice would last five days and we would not have to worry. So we spent the extra money only to be disappointed. Not only did this product not live up to its word, the ice melted after only five or six hours. We hardly opened the cooler. Don't waste you money. We tried refilling the cooler again only to have the same thing happen."
5,best 36qt. cooler ever made.,"I bought one of these about five years ago, and buying a replacement here cause as always, Amazon is the cheapest. This particular size cooler is perfect for a canoe, the low height is right at the center thwart of most canoes. The one I had finally got a crack in it after five years of hard use, about 100 days/yr. in the South Florida marine world. It had a GPS mount screwed to the lid and seat belt hinges. This cooler will, no bs, keep a case of beer and two paddlers happy, sippin' on cold ones for three days in 90 degree heat. You get the five days ice deal on winter trips on the Suwannee. It is definitely a cut above the others at a similar price."
4,Excellent remastering.,"Others below expound eloquently on the music, so this is just a quick thumbs-up for Michael Dempsey's excellent remastering of the original material which I remember well first time round sounding so muddy that it did take some of the gloss off. Finally the band's brilliance comes through clear as crystal. '18 Carat Love Affair' now shines and sparkles like a diamond, which is very welcome as it's one of the all-time great (if still unsung) pop masterpieces - unlike so much 80's music, Rankine & MacKenzie are beginning to sound distinctly timeless."
1,Infantile,"Brittle sound, hysterical vocals, the worst Motown cover ever (""Love Hangover,"" in case you were wondering): this is one release to avoid. ""The Affectionate Punch"" presented a (surprise, surprise) Bowie-influenced duo, and while even then Billy MacKenzie's vocals were hard to take, the lyrics were at times funny and Alan Rankine's settings (mostly minimal guitar) were worth a listen or three. Here, however, the duo descends into unlistenable synth-pop bad enough to make one appreciate Spandau Ballet. Yikes."
1,Hmmmmmm.........,"It's nice to see that some listeners are passionate about this album. 'Sulk' was recommended to me by a internet friend that turned me on to Modern Eon (FANTASTIC) - I took a chance thinking I had missed another fantastic 80's band - well....in this case, I didn't..... This is typical and easy to forget (thank heaven) sickly sweet and drippy 80's synth pop. This isn't synth pop like later New Order, Ultravox, Ministry's first album or even the Naked Eyes or Tears for Fears....this is Synth pop like something in the background of a low budget 80's teen sex comedy 'new wave' bar scene.... - I will say it's a hair better then anything Wang Chung ever did but only because the singing is so over the top that I actually was cracking up a couple of times with the vocal embellishments and pretention....."
4,I was hoping for another 'Unforgettable' cd.,"'Stardust' isn't quite 'Unforgettable,' but it still has some memorable tunes. It does take on the character that the 'Unforgettable' cd had, and is still definitely worth a listen."
3,Not a bad buy,The game blade runner in this package was not as good as i had hoped. It was an easy and quick game to beat. With not much variety in the way things could happen. The Dune game was pretty challenging and fun beating with all the characters. Though the wing commander prophecy game made the package worthwhile. It was very fun and i still haven't done everything it is capable of.
4,"Not her best one, but pretty good just the same","Some of the rhymes reach a bit. If you were a first time writer and you presented this one, you'd be laughed away. However, Boynton's drawings are clever enough. The counting's easy. It's not too typical for a counting book. I do like the ending.Her characters are always fat little funny animals doing very human things. That's a treat. I like the idea of a mommy cat and a kid cat sitting by the fire in an easy chair having a cat chat.We read this one a lot. It's a board book so it's nice and durable. My two kids have probably chewed on every book we've got. This one endures.This could be a good choice for a new mom."
4,Good reading selection,I've had this book for my daughter since she was a newborn. She's now 15 months and loves it. The cutout on the front cover intrigues her endlessly. The rhymes are short and cute. She loves to turn the pages herself. This is a book she grabs over and over again to be read.
3,Seriously?,"There is a part in the book where it says, Six is good for running a race, unless you're the one who is in last place, or something like that. Anyway, I wouldn't want to teach my child it's not ok to come in last. I wish she chose something else to rhyme with :) LOVE SANDRA BOYNTON BOOKS, this one is not my fave."
1,Book,This book was advertised as very good in appearance.....when received front cover bent in half and entire back page ripped and unable to read page at all!
1,Book content does not make much sense for a kid,"The book content doesn't make sense to a young child. I mean ""Four is good to explore, six is good for a race""..come on. The illustrations are also not very interesting. Would not recommend the book. We own a lot of Sandra boynton books but this one and Pajama time are not worth it"
2,didn't live up to expectations,Parts of this book were from a philosophical viewpoint not the life lesson's I would like my grandchild to learn.
5,simply sexy,these italian guys just got that sexy thing. these tracks are the best for cold winter days. that trip-hop sound with that special mediterranean style is simply original.
4,Excellent gift for profane friend(s),"I have been known to use the F-word, and I enjoy this book for it's wit and invention within the narrow parameters the ""author' has permitted him/her? self. If you are offended, you know what you can go do to yourself."
3,Not worth the money,This book is a lot shorter than it appears. It has very little re-readability because of this. I would save my money and just browse the selected pages online.
3,do not attempt,"i do not recommend actually trying to make-love (i don't like the ""F""-word, it sounds so nasty and animalish) to this book---trust me, you will get paper cuts. if you want to make-love to a book, i suggestGod Loves Baby: Soft Playtime Book (Baby Blessings). it is nice and soft and can be used in the bathtub!"
2,A one-time read,"This book is made to look at only once. When someone else (not you) owns it. I was in a boutique and saw it there and remember loving it, thinking it was clever and funny. I came home and ended up ordering it for a friend. When I got it, I flipped through it. The humor wasn't as great as the first time I saw it, looking at it in the store. And whats more, THERE ARE BLANK PAGES. It looks like someone at the printer messed up. I didn't remember it looking like that. I was slightly appalled. It looks horribly cheap. I wish I didn't order it, but hopefully my friend will like it as much as I did the first time."
3,FUN but not EXCELLENT,"fun enough concept and book, but not that overly creative in the end. good enough coffee table lay-around."
2,funny the first time...then not so much afterwards,"I thought this book would make a great gag gift for a friend, but when it arrived, and I started flipping through the pages, I thought better of presenting it as a gift. True enough, some of the images are hilarious, but some are really rather crude and more mean than funny. It's the kind of book that one wants to see, but not really own. Honestly, what are you going to do with it once you've gone through it?"
4,Funny,"I did enjoy looking at this book, and I was able to find it for a good price, but I think I would have felt like I overpaid if it had not been on sale. While it is funny, it is the same thing over and over, just pictures people vandalized. It would make a good gift for someone though, and it is a nice, funny book to have on your coffee table, or for when friends come over and want something funny to look at."
5,Funny.,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Valentine's, but decided to give it to him early. He likes it. Funny book."
2,mildly funny,this book was mildly funny but very juvenile... more of a gag gift sort of book than a hysterical read... i found it boring after the billionth f-bomb...
5,Another perfect record from Harvey!,This is one album that nay true music fan should own. If you want my opinion Harvey should be mentioned during any conversation that concerns guitarist. This album is another fine example of a genius at work. This is a well kept secret to the outside world and that should be told. Harvey's in is own ball park for sure. This album combines Baby Batter and some of his early harder edge blues leanings with a touch of fusion. How could you go wrong??
2,Not what I expected,"Before this album came out I had high expectations. I thought this was going to be the first rap group in a long time to mix rock with their music and not be terrible. And I wasn't right or wrong. Because the truth is, there is no rock sound in this album. It's actually just weak crunk and snap beats just like every other rap album nowadays. I heard Party Like A Rockstar a long time before this album came out and that song is good as a single but I figured it wouldn't be the best on the album which it was. So I expected the rest of the album to be completely different. But no, most of the songs sound exactly the same kind of like D4L's album only worse. A few songs were good, but the album as a whole fails. The lyrics are especially terrible. So overall, Rockstar Mentality falls short of all expectations. It really could have been better than it was. Its not even worth listening to. Pass this one up. If you want a good rap rock album, check out Hollywood Undead - Swan Songs."
5,Mini Monkey Keychain,I absolutely love this keychain! It is the perfect length and worth they money spent! Totally recommend it!!!
3,Oh Zac,"This is an interesting little documentary that I stumbled upon by accident. Its only an hour long, and it doesn't really give you any information that you wouldn't already know (or want to know) about Zac. Worth a rent, but maybe not a buy."
1,"Save yourself , avoid this movie","This movie reaches a new level of ""suck"" I didn't think was possible.If your looking for a horror flick along the lines of classic Full Moon (Puppet Master, Subspecies) you won't find it here. 1 star is too generous of a rating. At just over 1 hour long, it's not worth the twenty bucks I spent on it. If you must see this movie, rent it."
1,Terrible movie.,"This movie wasn't even B-grade. It was horrible. Horrible acting and horrible plot lines. It was called a mummy, but it resembled no mummy I had ever seen. It might be a mummy from some other world."
3,A bad good book,"The Pleasures of Helen is one of those disappointing books where the author has a very good idea but does not write well enough to do it justice. Sanders was mainly a writer of thrillers but decided to try his hand here at a straight novel. Helen is a thirty-something single Southern woman living in New York; with a reasonably well-paid but dead-end kind of a job in PR, she is very lonely and aching for love. Her best friend has just got herself a man; Helen is desperate for love but will settle for sex, and the three men she is involved with during the course of the novel are all disappointments in various ways.Sanders' empathy with Helen is obvious, and his description of her predicament is clear-eyed and accurate. If only he could write better! There's a much better novel inside this struggling to get out. {Maybe it's called Bridget Jones's Diary :-)}"
2,Disjointed story.,I felt the story was very disjointed and didn't hold my interest. This is the only story by Sanders that I've been disappointed with.
4,Goldsmith's music inserted back into the film!!!,"Great score from the master!!! Glad it got an official release!!!There's a chap on youknowhotube who has inserted Goldsmith's score back into the film for the scenes where Goldsmith had completed score. I must say his fabulous score makes a great impact on those scenes, especially the battle scene. While it was not a great movie, it definately raises a notch with the original score in there. Check it out by searching 'Goldsmith Timeline' for a scene by scene...."
3,GREAT GAME ! (FOR 1999),"Its an ok game, or at least it was for 1999.Graphics not that good.Why am I playing this?Cause I like this kind of games.And by the way if you are thinking to buy it here on Amazon for $ 20, then you are crazy.I bought this game for $ 5!!!Belive me you can buy this game for very little money.:-)"
5,A wonderful voice,"Elizabeth Ward is victorious in her debut novel. The narrative voice with which her characters speak becomes a gift to the reader. Rae, the main character, has a toughness that protects her inner core of sadness and it is her story that will remain with the reader for many years. A thoroughly entertaining and enlightening novel."
4,SMASHED!,"This is a beautiful little record that I listened to as a kid growing up on the beach in Florida. Leon's eccentric and offbeat vocals eventually grow on you until you become subconciously addicted. There isn't one great song on the album, but somehow it works. SMASHED is a sour sounding jazz tune that sounds great when it quickly breaks from the pop ditty ""If I Were a Carpenter"". Drift away with ""Spanish Harlem"", fast forward through ""Streaker's Ball"" into upbeat ""Working Girl"". Side two starts out slow with ""Time for Love"" and sets up for a Dylan (I think) tune ""Hollis Brown"". GOOD Choice for Leon fans. Who else listens to Leon Russell anyway?"
2,Duplicate Songs? What's Going On?,"I absolutely love the first 2 installments from this Now collection. I was so excited to see what was going to be on the 3rd release. What a dissapointment... All of the tracks are mediocre and they even have the nerve to include 2 songs included on the previous version. Little Saint Nick by The Beach Boys and Winter Wonderland by Louis Armstrong. What!? Would they include duplicate songs on the regular Now Hits CD's??? I think not. If you don't have Now Christmas 1 or 2, I highly suggest getting those versus the lame 3 installment. I can't wait until next year to see if they improve or just keep trying to sell the public the same songs as 1, 2, and 3. Merry Christmas!"
3,The Weakest of the Now Christmas',"The first two are way better than this third installment of Now Christmas. There are a few songs worth having, but many are skippable."
2,OK But not as good as ones I bought in the past,This CD was somewhat of a dissapointment. Wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Was okay but definitely not one of my better Christmas CD's.
4,Bought for kids,"Arrived in a timely fashion, kids like it, basically ok. Wish they'd do a collection of cd's though so you could by like a box-set"
2,The Chipmunks?,"I can't go higher than 2 stars on a CD set that includes The Chipmunks. People, this was released in 2006.Sure, they made it the last track on Disc 1 because they really knew it didn't belong there at all, but they were probably shooting for 36 tracks and the price was right.If you plan on ripping the CD, you'll have the option of yanking the Chipmunks. Otherwise you'll have to suffer through them every time Jingle Bell Rock ends."
1,Poor Selection,"I did not like the songs on the CD's. I was expecting old songs, sung by old artists. That is not what I got."
3,Review,I did not like all the songs on this CD. Some of them were oaky. Would not purchase this item again.
4,good collection,This was a really nice collection of christmas music. It had classics as well as new pop christmas songs and it made my drive home for the holidays that much more enjoyable.
3,Nazi payback,"The reader, Steve Hodson, does a nice job of creating mood for this story, but the story itself was rather unexciting and predictable. Anna Woltman is a woman, who although German, wants to kill Nazis for their atrocities in general, and for killing her husband, in particular. She takes gunshooting lessons in preparation, and falls for her trainer, who then becomes involved in her quest. There are some cat and mouse games between the hunter and the hunted, and a little danger involved, but there is not a great sense of suspense. Anna, who seems rather cold and remote, doesn't manage to invoke an emotional connection in the reader, who probably only cheers her on because of the evil the Nazis did."
1,Don't get screwed !!!,"I've been a McAfee fan for years, until last week. An antivirus auto-update didn't finish loading, which put my PC in a constant rebooting stage. After paying $$ to speak to someone at McAfee, and getting ""scripted brainless runarounds"", he finally told me it was my system vendor's problem and not theirs.I had to install a new hard drive, reinstall all my applications, and then restore my data from backups. I then decided to use a less popular, but well-reviewed antivirus product. It found a number of viruses in my restored data that McAfee had been missing for years.The new program only uses a fraction of the system RAM that McAfee did. McAfee's Security Center uses a lot of RAM, which is a waste, because its main purpose is to constantly annouce what McAfee software products you haven't bought yet.Don't buy McAfee, you can do a lot better !!"
2,Rebate woes,"I thought about going on with a tirade about how McAfee offers rebates on their products that never arrive. But too many people have beaten me to the punch. There are whole websites devoted to people who spent six months trying to get a promised rebate from them. My story is not at all original, I bought the product and carefully included everything the rebate asked for, mailed the whole shebang in and waited...and waited...and waited and FINALLY received a letter in reply saying that my claim was rejected because of missing form xxx. ""I'll have to take your word on that boys as you kept all the forms that I sent to yourselves instead of returning them with this note!!""I could have fought them over this but why bother it's only $20 and I have no leverage.Instead I'll just have to content my self with this little tirade...Oh and perhaps post a link to a company that lets you download a *FREE VERSION** of their commercial anti-virus software. [...]"
1,Virus Scan 9 failed to detect a known virus.,I couldn't believe it. Virus Scan 9 failed to detect Win32.Webber. This password stealing Trojan has been around since June 2003 yet McAfee failed to detect it. I'm not impressed. I uninstalled McAfee and loaded Zone Alarm Security Suite which detected and removed the virus. You can bet your sweet bippie that I'm returning this for a refund.
4,I like it fine.,"I got it about a month ago, it has worked as advertised for me so far. I am not aware of any virus it's or not catching. I like their update about known virus, kind of fun interactively. The security index is fine with me, I hardly look at it and when I do, it gives me pretty good info. I would have to say that you are better off buying the bundle (for normal user). Since the bundle is only like 50 dollars, it's cheaper than buying all the separate components. I saw this on sale (whosave dot coom, shows you online sales) at the time so I bought it. I don't have to pay for virus definition subscription, and i don't know when that will run out. for novice user I think this product is fine, you are mainly buying peace of mind and usability is more important."
1,Worst Support of Any Company,"I tried this software. It locked up my machine, consumed all of my system resources, and constantly consumed my full cable bandwidth reintiating downloads. Their was no way to get to techincal support other than paying an amount equal to the purchase price. Their entire web site seems constructed to take your money but give no service. I called to get a refund and waited on line for an hour. Only to find that the number they listed had no authority to give a refund. I waited more than a half hour on the second call. I warn you do not even consider this product."
1,McAfee-No stars...defective product...no support!!,"Installed McAfee VS 2005 9.0 on a perfectly good Dell 8200 Inspirion and it killed it dead. Don't buy this product...it didn't work on my PC where everything else worked fine. McAfee offers no warranty support and couldn't care less about customers. Stay away, very far away."
2,Works....but at what cost?,"I'm not sure if this is the same version that AOL gives to its memebers now but I had no problems with McAfee until I started playing games on my PC again. Actually any software that made heavy demands on my processor or graphics card experienced ""hiccups"" and some slowdown. It took me awhile to realize it but there is a program that McAfee runs in the backround (mcshield.exe) that runs even if McAfee itself is shut down (I guess to help monitor your system for incoming viruses). As soon as I uninstalled McAfee this problem disappeared. I definitely want comprehesive virus protection but not if the cost is not being able to enjoy games or movies on my system."
1,"Two installs, two failures","I've installed McAfee VS9.0 on two different machines with two different operating sytsems (98SE & XP1 w/o SP2). Both machines had major problems on the install. the 98SE machine could no longer access the interent after the install. McAfee online support told me what I described was impossible. It took me a few days but I finally figured out, by trial and error of restoring the machine and then doing various parts of the install, that in the 9.0 uninstall of the previous version it was wiping out my internet acces. I fixed that on my own. No help from McAfee despite the fact that descriptions of previous version installs doing a similar thing are in their online msg boards. I still have not fixed the XP1 machine yet. Wait on buying until they fix bugs they should have fixed in previous versions. Posted 1-4-05."
1,Insulting,"Now this is pretty insulting stuff . Greek pop singer George Alkeos discovers latin mania , sings a shallow annoying song ( the tittle track "" Syrmatoplegma "" ) and scores another top 10 hit single in his long and weirdly succesfull carreer . Alkeos has run out of ideas a long time ago . All his recent releases including this one lack inspiration , wit and any kind of depth . This is simply a must to avoid ."
3,OK- very predictable,This movie was not the best- but it's watchable. Mary-Kate and Ashley go on a road trip with some teenage friends and get stuck in numerous very predicatable scenarios. Sometimes it goes a little too far with what happens to them- but it's my opinion. On the good side- the scenery is very nice and what a great way to celebrate your 16th birthday!
1,I was Upset,"I have never really like mary kate and ashley movies but this one was NOT good. I think they could have done a lot better with the: clothes, acting, and make-up(they wear to much) i would'nt recomend this to most people unless they like bad corny movies. Some of their movies have been pretty awsome but this one was not one of their better movies."
3,Not as good as their other movies.,I think MKA could use some new help making their movies / TV shows. The quality of their shows isn't what it used to be.
3,Hot guys and money.,"Just make a movie where theres only one guy and the girls fight over him while he ends up liking the brunnette , the twins enemy, forcing the twins not talking to each other. Have thier names not be Kylie Taylor Chloe Riley or other mega-trendy names, (can't they just be Michelle and Jessica?) have them have one outfit perday, drive a seriously damaged honda civic, make thier parents be actual parents (not buddies), don't have them get involved in international cases, when they go on a road trip when thier car breaks down they are seriously screwed (i.e. middle of nowhere and no uber-freaky coincidences {i.e. jet planes...}). Let them e NORMAL don't nobody live like that. I would watch that movie."
2,Phooey!,"I think this is their worst movie to date yet, so totally unbelievable, just how much of their parents money did they acutally spend on that 'misadventure'? and please, like really does anyone get a classic car in a pink ribbion on their 16th birthday (they can in real life) but still. Their best movie was 'It takes two"" and the others were alright. i would recomend all their past movies. But their feature film coming in 2003 will be interesting to see.oh and the guys in this one weren't even that cute!!"
5,Grown-up Stars,"This movie is really great! I watched it with my daughter today and it really portrays the twins growing up. It is really important for these girls to stay wholesome, as they are my daughter's role models. This is definitely their best movie yet and I recommend it to everyone."
1,Thumbs up movie?,"First of all im a big huge fan of the olsen twins ever since full house was on. Since then i've watched all of their movies until now. Now im curious and wanting to see ""Getting there"" because i couldn't watch it before, but i am in doubts. according to some reviews people say that there other movies are better than this one, others say that this one was excelent. My best friend who is also a big fan has seen and said it was to ""Sissy"" that the twins were whoping and whoing all the time and not really acting like themselves. Im still in doubts wether to buy it or not, wether it's good or not? I need more coments from you people to know it it is worth the money or not.thanx"
5,Getting There-Simply The BEST,"God, I love it when Mary-Kate and Ashley make movies, but I'm just curious and inquisitive as to why there films are never released in theatres. I mean there good, so I feel they deserve a chance to placed into theatres. Well, that's just my opinion, but anyway you should see this movie. IT IS SPECTACULAR!!!! I simply thought is was terrific, mainly due to gorgeous twins, Mary-Kate and Ashley, (GOD, ARE THEY HOT OR WHAT?!). Anyway the film was great, so was the plot and of course so were the characters. Truly great and amazing. SEE GETTING THERE, if you know what's good for you! I have been a great Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen fan, and will continue to be until I die, and that's surely true. GOD I LOVE THEM! Thanks."
2,Not Their Best,"As soon as I saw this movie was out, I went and bought it. But I was quite disappointed. It is very hard to relate to because what parent will give a car to their 16 year old and let them go on a road trip, and not get mad when the car gets stolen?!?!? The plot wasn't strong and too many bad things happened. The guys were a little immature. I talked to other people who watched it, and they thought it was just as bad! I wouldn't recommened it, but all their other movies are great and I love them!"
4,its ok,this movie is good but the boys are SOOOOO stupid!!! i mean HELLO??? real boys are so not like that! you should not buy this if its more then 3 dollers.
2,Getting there....again,"Olsen twins used to be funny and cute, but I guess not anymore. Getting there is a remake of To Grandmother's House We Go, only now they are going to Olympics. It's time for Olsen twins to think of something more interesting and not take the ideas out of their own movies. The movie is pretty boring."
3,Kinda boring...,"To be honest with you, guys, it was...boring. The only reason I watch the movie from beginning to ending is not because I thought it would get interesting sooner or later (but didn't) is because 1 of the cute guys in there was Billy Aaron Brown, who I thought was cute when first notice him in the Disney's movie ""Going to the Mat"".But I guess you guys should watch it (if didn't) and see what YOU think about the movie."
2,Not Mary-Kate and Ashley's Best Movie,"Getting There, a movie with Mary-Kate and Ashley was probably one of their worst movies they have ever made. This movie is an endless cycle of getting lost in the middle of nowhere constantly, with only a small portion being dedicated to Salt Lake City and the Olympics. The acting by most characters was not as good as normal, (Mary-Kate and Ashley were still great!) The one part of the movie that I really did like was when MK+A were at the Olympics and their friend breaks her leg, one of the twins hooks up with a really hot skiier and at the end of the movie when all of them go sledding.There were some great parts in this movie, but I was overall disappointed."
3,Average,"This movie was an amusing piece of entertainment. It is a movie everyone should watch if they just want to have fun. This movie is not very deep in any way and sometimes the three main male characters can get on your nerves because of the way they act. They act like brainless surfer dudes most of the time. If you are a fan of the twins, you should definitely buy it."
2,I'm really disappointed,"I've loved the Olsen twins since they were on Full house. I never really LOVED any of their movies, but I have to say that I really liked ""It Takes Two."" Recently their movies have been kind of repetitive- they go to a foreign country and meet two boys. I thought this movie was going to be better, but it wasn't. The whole movie really is about ""getting there"" and it was the most boring movie I think they've ever made. The boys were surfers, and were portrayed as these mindless idiots. There was a very weak plot, and very little action. It was really stupid how every attempt they made to get to Utah failed. The other thing I didn't like was how once again, mary-Kate and Ashley were living in a fantasy world. They had money to go on planes, buses, cars and other various ways of transportation to get to Utah. Oh, and no chaperones either. Overall, I was really disappointed."
1,Watch it just because it's so horrible,"Normally I don't waste time on movies that I have read or heard so many bad things about, but with Getting There there were just so many 1 ratings on NetFlix I had to see just how bad it was. Three words, they were right."
1,not good,"I will not deny being an Olsen fan; I have been ever since their Full House days. I love their movies from when they were much younger, but I can't stomach their others. They need stronger plots in their movies; all this movie is is Mary-Kate and Ashley playing spoiled twin girls who not only get a brand new convertible from their parents on their 16th birhtday, but also get their parents' permission to take a road trip to the Olympic Games with a few friends. Already, I couldn't relate to them. I think that's one problem with the twins' more recent acting: you can't relate to their characters. The Olsens are plenty talented and pretty, but I wish they'd stop using the same formula in their videos. They're either getting on a plane and shooting a movie in a new country or portray the same types of teenagers doing the same things in every movie. Don't get me wrong--I'll always be a fan, but not of these kinds of movies."
2,an unrealistic flick with bad acting,"Aside from the Olsen twins, I thought the acting in this film was downright...well, it was bad. The movie was also unrealisitic. What parents let their twin daughters, their 2 friends, and 3 members of the opposite sex go to a ritzy ski lodge in Utah to watch, of all things, the Olympics? And what parents give their kid a fire engine red convertible for their birthday? And what kids just keep buying zillions of plane tickets, throwing away about 200 bucks per ticket? And who thought a movie about trying to get somewhere would be entertaining? The only reason this movie got 2 stars was because there were a few remotely funny parts, and the Olsen twins were what held the whole movie together. Them not ending up with boyfriends was pretty funny - their friends did though. Usually their movies are like they say hi to a boy and he falls instantly in luv. Although Kylie does have an admirer in this movie..."
2,Blah...boring...corny,"I have been a fan of Mary-Kate and Ashley for about 10 years, but I just have to rate this movie low. It was just boring unless you enjoy seeing the girls and their friends just driving, screaming, etc... There really isn't much of a plot here. Even if you're a fan, you can easily pass on this. The movie jumps to music and plain videos of the girls and their friends driving and playing around every few minutes...Sure hope their next movie will be better."
1,THIS STUNK...,"Need I say more? I respect Mary Kate and Ashley for their financial success, so I would have thought they'd have had more sense than to make this garbage. SO VAPID. I shudder to think that my kids might want to watch this someday."
4,Girls rule!,"I really love all of the movies Mary-Kate and Ashley did. They are so different from all the other teen-movies. They make movies for kids in any age. They are really light stuff and are great to relax. It helps me to get a few new fashion tips, because Mary-Kate and Ashley are always very fashion forward!If you're an Olsenfan you simply have to get this movie!!By the way: I made my driver's licence test 3 days ago and didn't pass, so maybe this movie will help me surviving my sadness and make me try again!!"
2,crappy package,I received this package today in the mail. It was not the way I was told I was getting it. The outside package was riped like someone tried to open it. The dvd its self looks like someone tried to open it. I hope my daughter doesnt notice it when she gets it for christmas. I am happy about this NO WAY.
3,"This tape will make you want to ""run, jump, skip, and sing!""","This is another great tape for children! While it doesn't have voices from ""Barney & Friends"" cast members, it is still a great tape! It contains old favorites as well as some new songs."
3,Rating for dvd not movie,"I actually just saw this for the first time, and I enjoyed the film very much. It gets a 4.5 from me. The disc on the other hand is a different matter. I only watched it on a mono TV so I can't really comment on the sound. It did sound very clear to me though, and the score was fantastic. However, I couldn't help but notice that the ""superbly restored picture"" was extremely murky, or flat even, at certain parts of the film. If this was an all out restoration than why was there still artifacting and film grain present? I'm sorry, but the video quality, although good, could certainly be improved on. This film needs a new release with better picture, and more special features. It would be great if a company like Criterion could get a hold of it."
3,Letterbox format,"I'm not going to waste your time telling you about this movie. You already know all there is to know - it's a classic.I've been collecting Hitchcock movies for years - and am currently upgrading my titles from VHS tape to DVD (widescreen, where appropriate).Widescreen is appropriate in this case (1.85:1) - but we are only offered the film in letterbox format. That is a significant compromise - I wanted anamorphic widescreen (enhanced for 16:9 screens).Three stars for half-hearted effort."
5,Real and Surreal,I think its terrific in noting all the different responses to this unique film. Viewers have noted that their questions about certain scenes are still unresolved. All one has to notice is the films score and subsequent montage when Scottie sees the neckless on Novak. The ultimate kaliedescope !
2,screwie plot,"Kim Novak does fine work here, as usual, but the entire story is way too far-fetched to be believable.Movie is overrated.And that ending? Come on. Really?Pfffft."
1,I must be thick,"Why is this interminable film so highly regarded?We do a lot of driving around. We climb lots of staircases that are filmed from weird angles. We get some classic shots of San Francisco. We get a story line that's implausible but which is gussied up to respectability by the use of terms such as ""obsessional"".We learn in the DVD bonus material that Hitchcock actually used a metronome to pace Kim Novak's final traipse up those wooden stairs from which she takes her biiiiiiig step.I reckon Hitchcock used the metronome throughout the movie and set to its slowest possible speed. Slow pace = suspense. Doesn't it?Yeh, I must be really thick."
4,Don't Look Down!,"Definitely not for those with acrophobia, ""Vertigo"" tells the story of a police detective who developed vertigo after a near fatal fall who must come to grips with his phobia at a most horrific time.James Stewart explores his dark side once again with Alfred Hitchcock. Like the wheelchair-bound photog in ""Rear Window"", the police detective is not really a nice guy, certainly not nice to the women who love him. This creates complexity for the audience: You're supposed to feel some sympathy for him, yet you can't really like him, either.He's been hired to shadow Kim Novak, a beautiful, aloof, and somewhat suicidal blonde married to an old friend. Stewart becomes caught up in her spell, only to suffer the worst of consequences when his vertigo kicks in at a crisis. Lots of surprises all the way up to the very last second.Look up ""Vertigo"" in your video store, but don't look down!"
5,Hitchcock At The Top Of His Game,"When I was a teenager, my father took me to see a double feature (remember those?) at The Bethesda Theatre, in Bethesda Maryland. It was sometime late in the fifties or early sixties. The bill comprised of ""Vertigo"" and ""To Catch A Thief"". I was so spellbound by ""Vertigo"", that I remember very little of, ""To Catch A Thief"". The story is wonderful lots of twists and at times very droll. James Stewart, great as always, but Kim Novack was so radiant in the film that I dreamt of her for months after. I have viewed this film countless times and still am caught off guard by the story turns. If you haven't seen ""Vertigo"" please do and if you haven't seen it in a while,it's worth your time to re visit, Mr Hitchcock The Master of Suspense's ""Vertigo""."
3,Not remastered,"I bought this DVD. and it's not remastered.And not enhanced for 16:9 TV.When viewed on widescreen Tvs, the picture does not fit on the screen."
5,Dizzying! Spellbinding!,"Admittedly, this is not my favorite Hitchcock film. However, this is truly a great movie. For some reason, when I first saw it about 15 years, I did not appreciate the subtlety of the filmmaking. Jimmy Stewart is great in this film. If you don't buy this DVD, then at least rent it and watch this!"
2,"The movie is great, the transfer is poor","I won't address the relative merits of the content of Vertigo. I think the vast majority agree it's one of Hitch's best, and that's saying a lot.The Universal transfer is NOT anamorphic, which means if you have a HDTV you're going to be either watching this in ""zoom"" mode or window-boxed AND letterboxed. Frankly this is inexcusable, this DVD was released on September 2, 2003 and by that time EVERYTHING that's not 1.33:1 aspect ratio was anamorphic.So Universal dropped the ball with this DVD (and the whole set)...I would steer clear and use your old VHS copies until they get around to releasing the ""super-deluxe Hitchcock collector's edition""."
1,I Feel Dizzy!,"Skip this edited or censored disc. I remember with excitement the original with James Stewart and Kim Novak. But, according to the ""product details"" provided by Amazon, Stewart and Novak are missing from this third ""special"" version. My advice is to wait for the fourth dip into the Hitchcock canon, when hopefully Stewart and Novak will be restored to their starring roles."
3,Really Widescreen?,"Hasn't anybody else noticed that the DVD edition of Hitchcock's most beautiful movie adds very little width to the full screen VHS edition, and instead loses quite a lot of height? Not quite as bad as 'Psycho', but what is going on here? Whatever happened to Vistavision?"
5,Five stars is an understatment,"Shakespeare on film. This is a well-crafted tale of love, obssesion and the psychosis surrounding them both. Vertigo, the disorienting condition of the main character, is equated with the obsessive yet imbalancing power of love and the tale has a satisfyingly ""minor key"" ending. I can not love this film more. A must for anyone who professes to love movies."
3,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in Vertigo. The first half of the movie is a bit too slow and the ending is simply depressing. I feel Psycho is superior on a number of levels: acting, cinematography, intensity of plot, pace of film, overall cohesiveness. The trickery with Kim Novack is good , but I feel a similar ploy was done with much greater effect using Orson Welles in The Third Man, which I consider a clearly superior film."
1,Virtigo VHS.,The video was lousy. I would not have bothered had I known. I shall not buy VHS any more. Yuck
5,Excellent movie but restoration is lacking.,This is one of the best movies of all time. However I have a 16x9 widescreen TV and this special edition DVD is not enhanced for 16x9 TVs!
3,great movie...but no anamorphic?!?!,"I love Vertigo, and there's no reason for me to go on about how great it is, as everyone else has taken care of it. I'm simply here to gripe that this dvd is not anamorphic which is a shame since it is for one of the most stunning looking films. If you have a standard television, it's a non-issue, but HDTV owners may want to steer clear. It's certainly a picky gripe, but as hdtv's grow more and more popular, i'm sure it is something that others will care about. Of course, most HDTv's can zoom and stretch the image so that it fills up the 16x9 frame (same ratio as the film), but it definitely doesn't have the clarity of an anamorphic transfer."
2,Were we watching the same movie?,"This film was on my ""must-see"" list for years because of its great reputation. I finally watched after a co-worker raved about it, and I must say that I have never encountered a more overrated film. It started very well and I had high hopes for it. Many scenes were indeed hypnotic and beautiful, but they just went on too long. I was still intrigued, though, and a great ending would have banished my doubts. The finale, though, was so abrupt and ludicrous that I laughed out loud...and then my jaw dropped in disbelief that this was actually the end of the film.At the time of its release, this film was not warmly received; now it makes lists of the top ten films of all time. Go figure."
2,Highly Overrated. Don't expect much from it.,"This movie must be one of the most highly overrated movie. I liked Hitchcock's Psycho very much but was totally dissapointed with this one.To begin with, the movie is very slow. It is unnecessarily lengthy and the story is unbelievable. I am not surprised at all that this movie bombed at box office when originally released. Overall, a very overrated movie. Gets 2 stars because of good acting."
5,hitchcock's best movie,"the most eerie movie i've ever seen. if it had ended with someone waking out of a dream, i wouldn't have been surprised. instead, it ends with a complete shock. it really doesn't get any better than this. jimmy stewart gives the performance of a lifetime. i can't believe hitchcock topped strangers on a train, but this movie puts it to shame."
4,Not bad,"The first half of the movie is pretty scary and entertaining. But after the secret is revealed, nothing is scary anymore.Here is what I learned from the movie:1. Don't try to save a man on a steep roof if you can't balance yourself.2. Men prefer mysterious beautiful women than sunny, earthly girls. :-)Is SF still that beautiful nowadays?"
3,Boring!,"I love Hitchcock, especially The Birds, The Wrong Man, & Frenzy. Therefore, I was totally shocked at how I felt about Vertigo. I had always heard and read that it was a great movie. However, it took me 4 or 5 attempts to get through it. I kept falling asleep. It was one of the most boring movies I've ever watched. Long shots of Stewart thinking or driving were more than I could take."
1,More of the same,"Vertigo (Alfred Hitchcock, 1958, 128')>>>Alfred Hitchcock was known as the most controlling of directors, particularly when it came to women. The female characters in his films reflected the same qualities over and over again: They were blond. They were icy and remote. They were imprisoned in costumes that subtly combined fashion with fetishism. They mesmerized the men, who often had physical or psychological handicaps. Sooner or later, every Hitchcock woman was humiliated (Roger Ebert).<<<Anybody who cares for the above will be happy with Vertigo, whoever doesn't will find her- or himself in a minority. So consider this a minority view.216us - Vertigo (Alfred Hitchcock, 1958, 128') -More of the same - 5/12/012"
5,"Hitchcock's best, hands down.",Let's cut to the chase: has there EVER been a better mixture of musical and visual than this brilliant film? This is my favorite film of all-time and this restoration was a God-send. The look and sound are INCREDIBLE. The extras are pure eye candy-a joy to watch. THIS is the film AH should be remembered for. Essential.
5,Wonderful!,"I can't say how cool this movie is. It is eerie, suspensful, and just all around good. It gets better every time you see it."
4,Vertigo a terrific experience!,"This is a Masterpiece! wonderfully restored, Vertigo is one of the few movies that you are possitive you can see time after time and be sure that you are going to love it! Hitchcock's best movie so far! The restoration process is wonderfully described in a full aditional chapter as information about the movie and the Director. A trully piece of collection !"
5,Thought's emotions put to visual film,"Tremendous film, I first saw it when i was 14, as part of a theatre double header with Rear Window. Naturally I liked Rear Window better than Vertigo-but that was then. Vertigo seemed dreamy like and inconclusive. Now, 16 years later and an owner of the dvd, I understand the capriciousness of life and of this movie. I was blown away by the colors and dialogue of this complex film. You truly feel as if you are in the movie, an invisible spirit perched on Scottie's shoulder, perhaps. The colors, the drama, the twists and turns....a glimpse into a San Francisco long gone and human emotions that are eternal. You cannot help but think of obsession and loss after seeing this great film."
5,Sonic Collection,I purchased this Playstation collection for my grandsons (3 of them) and what can I say? They loved it. They whooped and shouted when they opened the package. What else could a grandma want? What they want now is a new Playstation or WII or whatever they are.
2,This game sucks!!!!,"I thought i would like Sonic games and christmas last year i did. But the more i played this game the more boring it got. I couldnt figure out out how to save my game file. When i did save, i still had to start all over again! The other problem i had, which might just might be me, is after a while of playing it when Sonic would go really fast, I got headaches. So i would stop playing. Just thinking about it gives me a headache. Maybe someday ill try it again and maybe it will be fun. Who knows. After playing it my views on Sonic has changed. I will probably never play this game again. If you want a good platformer Mario's 2-D games are AWESOME and Super MArio 64 DS. I have yet to try Mega Man. It kinda looks likes Metroid (Not those Prime games which, i think, is a FPS game) but more kid friendly. Metroid Zero Mission and Super Mario World are much better buys then this boring game. You ever rarely even control SOnic. This makes a better rental."
3,Nostalgic headache,"I really enjoyed these games growing up but I never owned them. Therefore, I was really excited to get the chance to play these games and actually beat them. The problem is that I can barely figure out the controls and I have found it very frustrating trying to get anywhere in the games I remember being so fun in my youth.I don't mind that I bought it, though. The comics are neat and I'm sure I will eventually sort out the controls. Maybe half of the time I can get somewhere with the games and when I do it is fun. I would guess this would be more fun for gamers that were more serious back in the 80's."
2,Sonic game plus,I just got my sonic collection in the mail...Can i actually play this game or is this a greatest hits collection meaning we just watch them play it! Hopes this does not sound too stupid...
2,Something's WRONG,"The game plays itself, almost as if it's in DEMO mode and I cannot play it or figure out how to work it. I'm not a total moron. If you go to the end of the list of games you can play a VERY low res version of this game. Glad I only paid $5. It would cost more in shipping to return it then what it's worth. I also contacted the seller and THEY WERE OF NO HELP TO ME AT ALL. Didn't even GET BACK to me."
4,Sonic Mega,six year old and 4 year old just love this game and it will keep them busy for many hours
4,"Lots of choices, classic gaming","I got this because my kids got into sonic from tv and their friends... there are many different sonic games to choose from, varying in difficulty. My kids have enjoyed the games, its a benign game in terms of any violence for video games for kids. I also enjoyed playing some of the games, having played them myself 20 years ago."
5,Glorius Sonic Memories Relived,"I really loved this collection of sonic games. It was perfect. Its just like having an emulator, except all the games are already on the disk and you get to play through your TV. It even has the ""quicksave"" feature that emulators have, letting you load to any point in the level if you choose. The only slightly negative part is, how you attain some of the bonus games, like knuckles in sonic 3 or knuckles in sonic 2, is you just have to open and close some of the other games you dont really play about 20 times. A stupid way to earn the bonus games, but it didnt take very long. To sum up, its exactly how i remembered it on genesis, except i'm holding a ps2 controller, not genesis."
4,Airtex Fuel Pump,This is a low pressure fuel pump (2.5 - 4 psi) and replaces my mechanical pump on a 1991 Nissan Sunny/Sentra with a 1500cc carburetted engine. The pump did not require a return line to the fuel tank. Mounting it was the most difficult part as the Sunny has very little space near to the fuel tank. Electric pumps tend to be better pushers than pullers so the closer to the tank the better.
1,It was the wrong pump.Right box wrong pump.,The picture on the box was correct. The pump in side the box was wrong. The pump I needed is for in the tank. The one you sent me was for external.
2,good....,"the game. is pretty, has acceptable graficos, is intersante but for my it has a terrible defect. it is handled single with the arrows of the control... is extremely incomodo to handle. and it makes very slow for my taste... quizas for somebody less interactive works well. at my parecio very slow... by demas I arrive myself on time in excellent conditions...."
4,Informative Book,Great starter book for those interested in Student Affairs. The structure of the book makes it easy to follow and comprehend.
2,you think it's butta but it's not it's b***** it margarine,"This cd could be butta,should be butta,and would be butta,it's more like ol skool margarine UWK DJ'S wreck the whole vibe by consistently talking over the tracks and shouting out to each other.You can't listen to more than two tracks without them running they gibbs.Out of the 17 tracks you might get about 5 or 6 uninterrupted tracks.Talking over the MC's ryhmes is whack,The cd has over 21 minutes of this crew shouting out to each other and thats whack, why you trying to outshine the MC'.When i saw the YZ track Masterplan and the Lakim Shabazz Black Is Back i was like yea then these mouth all mighty tounge everlasting diarrhea at the mouth dj's yap thru the whole YZ after i heard that i was done."
3,so close...,"Most of the songs on this album are classics, especially the ones on the black power tip. But, those DJs, the Universal Wack Kings -- er, the Universal Wax Kings -- talk ALL THE WAY through most of the songs. A few shout-outs are okay, but a whole hour of them is seriously wack. A real disappointment from an album that could be tight."
4,Great value,"If you have a child that likes to play pretend, he will love these. And with the price, you can not go wrong! Would have 5 stars, but the band that you place over your fingers will come off. The bands are not hard to put back on though."
1,"Item was okay, poor seller.",I ordered a pack of these as stocking stuffers the lights themselves were fine. Unfortunately the item arrived with the package open and the one colour (green) that I really needed was missing.
4,Lights,"The Lights were great. worked very well. The band on one fell off, but the rest are still being used."
2,horrible,there fun to play with but there cheap and the lights dont work after an hours worth of use and they cut off your circulation
2,Not worth the money,"While the beams were as advertised, small enough to fit small fingers, the cost of the batteries was outrageous! The shipper sent them right away but I woudn't recommend this product."
4,Fun in the dark,I like this product because it is fun in The dark. I also like this product because they fit any size finger except the one of them the clear one did not work.
3,not as good,"it's not to say that the album is bad, per say. I just didn't find it nearly as good as the self-titled record, which I loved. Maybe I would have liked it more if I hadn't known the self-titled album, but it didn't measure up to me."
3,An album that Worhts Buying it!,Its not like the the previous album that u could probably put 5 stars out of five but its definately a good cd that worths buying it!
5,The Best of The BARRIO BOYZZ,Well 2 me this CD is great. It's got some awesome music n' great lyrics. Hans Giraldo makes the cd even better than what it already is. These guys have great voices that combine into 1 great CD. This comment has been short n' sweet. Hope it helps you guys decide on getting this great cd. It's really worth it; I assure it. It's kind of like the latino JAGGED EDGE -O- 112...Well gotta go. N I wanna see some feed back soon.Love me Heidy Michelle
5,best intro to calculus book ever,"Of course, I must be biased, since I have not read every intro to calculus book ever, but yet I maintain my position. :-)I first saw this book when I was about seven years old, and fell in love with the comics. I didn't understand the math at the time, but eventually I got to calculus level mathematics in college, and thanks to this book, I not only had no fear of calculus, but rather looked forward to it.I only wish that the authors had went on to cover integral calculus and infinite series... but I shan't blame them. This book is great enough as it is. :-)"
3,Science fiction meets identity theft,"This science fiction film was poorly received when it came out, but in retrospect was rather underrated. It is adapted from a story by the late Philip K. Dick, whose work also provided the basis for the more successful films Blade Runner and Total Recall. The plot is concerned with the malleability of human identities. In a future society under martial law, an executive who is loyal to the regime suddenly finds himself arrested by the secret police, accused of being an enemy infiltrator, and facing summary execution. Most of the film is concerned with his miraculous escape and desperate fight for survival, until there is a surprising twist that adds a sinister new significance to the events."
4,Surprisingly Good Movie,"Although I am not much into Sci-Fi movies, this one was suprisingly interesting with an unexpecting ending. D'onofirio is just an amazing actor. He should've had the lead, but then again, it doesnt matter what role he plays, he alwyas manages to steal every scene he is in. Worth Watching even if you are not a Sci-Fi fan."
5,The Impostor,"Another movie that was clear and I just love it....I have been looking for this movie for quite a while, and I just love the clarity, sound, and picture."
3,Weird Sci-Fi,"Yeah sure, aren't most sci-fi flicks weird? Okay, still a pretty good plot with exceptional acting from Vincent D'Onofrio, as Hathaway, who seemed a little like his Law & Order; CI character on the hunt for ""Spence,"" played by Gary Sinise. I particularly liked the character of ""Cale,"" played by Mekhi Phifer as the Mercenary who ended up helping Spence in his quest for the truth about himself; and got also the medical supplies needed for his ""merc"" colleagues in the process. Which in the end paid off for the mercenaries."
4,this ain't no B-movie,"Impressed to say the least. The good: it's a great story that kept my attention to the end, the acting was above par (even for secondary roles), and good Sci-fi is so rare. The downside: use of helmets taken directly from ""Starship Troopers"" wardrobe, and somewhat repetitive CGI shots. Overall the CGI was impressive though and seemed to help carry and enhance the story instead of being the feature. The main thing is not to miss this movie if you enjoy good sci-fi. I had never even heard of it while it was in the theatre."
3,"Well-acted, intelligent sf","Philip K. Dick wrote the stories that inspired the movies Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, and Impostor. I think this one will mostly appeal to his fans and to fans of the TV series The Outer Limits. Instead of trying to become some great scifi blockbuster, it focuses on strong acting, intelligence, and plot twists. Still, the frequent action sequences might help it slowly reach a larger audience, even if it initially gets lost among the holiday fluff. I wouldn't call this one of the best science fiction movies ever, but certainly one of the more intelligent and well-acted ones I've seen recently."
3,sci-fi not at it's best,"this movie had potential, gary's portrayal ofthe fugitive scientist was good,..there was wasted time in the middle of the movie,....i feel there was something missingfrom this movie, it did not last long at the box office.however,it can be a movie added to any sci-fi collectionfor the storey line, and effects."

4,what does it mean to be human?,"It's an older movie, i saw it years ago, thought i'd revisit it for my dystopia/apocalytic movie watching.It's theme is what does it mean to be human.It proposes several possible answers:to have human characteristics that a machine can distinguish from non-human.love. striving to stay alive. burning curiosity to know who we are.Something about knowing reasons for God's existence and possessing a soul.It is a nice touch that the secondary trigger was the realization that he was not human. As if to say that frantic search was from the human copied part of him, but when it was satisfied it self destructs, thus the journey itself is the destination. It's not a real deep movie, but worthwhile to watch, and maybe even watch for a second time, years later. It certainly doesn't even scratch the surface of the complexity of the question: what does it mean to be human. But is a nice introduction to thinking about it."
4,Good movie with a great ending.,"Didn't know what to expect when I saw this movie, but I am a Gary Sinese fan and enjoy his work.I was not disappointed. It keeps you thinking and changing your mind throughout.If you are looking for a good sci-fi flick with a great ending, then this is one to watch."
3,guilty pleasure,"Probably the biggest accomplishment of this film is that Sony made a few more dollars by selling the ""Starship Troopers"" costumes to yet ANOTHER buyer (and threw in some stock footage to boot.)But, I'll go see any movie based on Philip K. Dick's stories and there was enough of the sensibility of his scenario-writing here to keep me watching. If you can catch a matinee and can accept more ""Screamers"" and less ""Blade Runner,"" then you might enjoy this."
5,Another great Sci-Fi sleeper movie,"Based on Philip K. Dick's book, this movie is surprisinglt unknown to many who love Sci-Fi. It's theater release was overshadowed at the time, and soon found itself in DVD circulation. A worthy addition to your library for sure. Great acting, and special effects. You won't be sorry."
3,Dr. Kimble gone Sci-Fi,"This movie offers good actors, good visual effects, good production design, good director, and quite a collection of good sci-fi ideas.But all these features can't quite compensate for the fact that the plot is nearly 100% identical with ""The Fugitive"". It's the well-known ""convicted man must infiltrate the hornet's nest to find proof for his innocence while the cops are after him"" story all over again.Fortunately, the ending offers a somewhat suprising variation on the theme. A worthwhile film to watch, but no milestone."
1,stinker of an adaptation of good philip k dick story,I don't know how this was made so crappy it was such an awesome short story. The casting was like united colors of beneton and so forecfully multi racial its laughable. Typical 90s tripe. They mix the story up at end and in middle had so many unlikely things happen that it is really friggin hilarious.
2,could have spent my time on better things...,"This is not a very good movie. The plot was very flat and unconvincing. A substantial amount of the events in the film took place at night, so the pictures were rather dark.Overall, I believe the director could have done a much better job. My major mistake was to have seen this movie before reading the reviews here."
1,Same old boring stuff!,"I thought this film lacks an interesting plot - it turned out to be a repetitive rehash of stock sci-fi's. I advise ""Serenity the movie"" for a well made and unpredictable plot!"
1,This movie was pathetic.,"Sorry, but I had this movie figured out within ten minutes. Talk about formulaic. Friends told me the visual effects were ""awesome"" but I was hard pressed to find anything that hadn't been done better in any number of other sci-fi thrillers. Hard to believe Gary Sinise got involved with this one. I'm not surprised Madeline Stowe was involved...her career has been on a downslide for years. The costume design was weak, set design weary, dim, and gray for no reason, and supporting actors like the military characters were forced."
1,I've seen better film on a sink full of old dishwater,"The plot is tired. I'm sure it was terribly original way back when Phillip K. Dick wrote it fourty or more years ago, but we've seen elaborations on elaborations of this story. the characters are one dimentional stereotypes. The futuristic setting is poorly shot, poorly lit and uninspired (I guess the future is in some sort of power shortage). The 'twist ending' is predictable and anticlimactic. Again, we've seen this bit of 'storytelling' more than once before.This film was made for hardcore science fictions fans, but it uses hardcore science fiction cliches. You draw the conclusion....."
1,sci-fi stupid,"man this movie was really annoying and was long. who cares man, just dont bother with this one. the actors dont save this one. no one can act in it. Gary Sinise has dry emotions and the others like Vincent D'Onofrio are so horrible. at the end with that big explosion is the best thing, yay, hes really an impostor and he blew him self up and all the other people. prepare yourself before watching this junk"
4,The Original Short Film is the prize of this DVD!,"A very close adaptation to Philip K. Dick's 1953 short story, the original short film was later expanded (more like bloated) to a theatrical length, and it shows. Although the short film is missing the CGI effects of Industrial Light & Magic that is displayed in the theatrical version, the presence of a fine cast and tight, flowing script make this short film the reason to buy this DVD. A must for any PKD fan."
4,Much better if you dont know who's the creator of the story,"Luckily I didnt know who the original creator of the story was before watching it so I was charmed by the story and surprised by its ending, important ingredients of my high rating. Not until I read the comment by other reviewers that I found out who the story writer is, and I understood why many were disappointed, for they had expected something more than Total Recall and Blade Runner.In my opinion, this movie is a hybrid of the above two plus the Fugitive, with many positive elements from each of them. Disregarding the similarities in the P.K. Dick's stories, and considering it only as a B Class budget movie, the entertainment and thriller parts are present. With the superb performance of Oscar winner Vincent D'Onofrio, this movie is definitely outstanding amongst any no brainer futuristic thrillers with sheer visual effects."
4,Good overall general reference,"This book was a very colorful, nicely laid out reference for British Airborne and Glider troops in WW2. The book was an easy read and was grouped nicely. Many of the patches appeared to be repros, and several of the rarer unit patches were not present. This book is a must for the beginner, but lacks the in depth feel I was looking for, as an established insignia/uniform collector. With that said, I would still recommend this book to other militaria collectors."
4,Good but overproduced.,This book gives a reasonably complete explanation of photographic lenses for the casual to moderate user. It has some decent explanations of various lens characteristics. I drop it to a 4 rating because it could have been better had the author used pictures purposely aimed at showing lens differences. Unfortunately someone in the advertising department must have gotten a hold of the production decisions and filled the book with cutesy stock-photo advertising type shots that dumb the personality of the book down to a coffee table type book rather than create the educational type experience it could have been. A shame such great information is presented like a PhotoShop retouched advertising brochure.
2,MISLEAD,I THOUGHT THIS BASSINET WAS PERFECT FOR MY BABY GIRL. UNFORUNTALY WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS BROKEN IN SEVERAL PLACES. I DID SEND IT BACK AND RECIEVED A NEW ONE. THE BEDDING LOOKS VERY ELEGENT ONLINE BUT IT IS VERY MISLEADING. MINE HAS A LITTLE GIRL CHRILDREN FISHING AND CLIMBING TREES. NOT WHAT I PICTURED FOR MY DAUGHTER. I AM GOING TO BUY DIFFERET FABRIC AND MAKE A DIFFERNT LOOK.
4,sheets for bassinet,A TWO pack of white sheets to fit the round bassinet are available at Target or www.target.com for $24.99. You can also buy the sheets and add a little bit of fabric dye to easily change the color to match anything in baby's room. Good luck everyone!!!
4,It's beautiful,"I got this as a gift at my shower.. Itis beautiful, and if you have the money to spend, then go right ahead and get one. I personally would not have purchased it, because before my baby reached three months she had already outgrown it. Thank heavens she was starting to sleep in her room, else she would be in bed with us every night, which I am not too keen on.Yes, it is beautiful, but I guess I wouldn't pay so much for something which will be outgrown so fast."
4,Another good Christmas CD....,"I try to pick up at least one or two new Christmas CDs every year, and I was thrilled to see that Third Day put one out this year. It's good. Being Third Day, the music is better than most of the mediocre Christmas CDs that are spit out each holiday season.Unfortunately, they didn't really stretch any Christmas music boundaries. There are only so many variations on ""O Holy Night,"" ""Angels We Have Heard On High,"" and ""Joy to the World,"" and the original music that Third Day wrote for this release is not the most interesting stuff they've ever done.If you're a Third Day fan or you don't own much Christmas music, this is a great CD. If your Christmas collection goes back further than five years, however, this one won't stand out as anything new or unique."
5,Christmas Songs,We bought this for Christmas for our daughter and she loves it. She still plays it in the car even though Christmas is over.
5,awsome!,i love it it brings so muc hjoy and love into my life and i just feel so good singing the words in my head all day long. i love this CD
5,Staple of Christmas listening!,"I am not usually a fan of too much ""reworking"" of Christmas classics, I am a bit of a traditionalist when it comes to Christmas music. This album, however, is a MUST HAVE if you are a Third Day fan. I don't really think there is a song on here that I don't love singing along to, and their take on the old stand-by's breathe new life into them. Great purchase!"
5,Third Day Christmas album,"I bought this album after hearing one of Third Days songs on youtube, I really have enjoyed it."
2,Buy A Kitten Harness with Mini Connectors Instead,"I bought the Feather Tether Bird harness for my Cockatoo. This device works but is unnecessarily difficult to use. The metal clasps require you to use your fingernail to actuate, blindly under a feathered wing. The clasps swivel too, so it takes 5x as long to put this on your bird than a simple kitten harness with tough plastic connector mechanisms. My bird didn't mind the harness once it was on. And actually he liked the whole fiddling process because of all the extra attention. However, my patience was wearing out. I bought a similar styled kitten harness for less that uses the clip connectors you see on luggage except these are size appropriate. With 2 clips the kitten harness was on (3 swivel metal clips for the Feather Tether) and was equally suitable. The kitten harness came with a little bell which my Cockatoo removed after a few minutes."
4,Sweeps You Up,"My experience with Thomas Costain's 1945 novel ""The Black Rose"" is that it sweeps you up in its arms and refuses to let you go. The tale of Walter of Gurnie starts with his radical student days at Oxford University circa 1273, his infatuation with the aristocratic beauty Engaine and then takes you on his adventures with the Mongols into China. His friend Tristam is one of the great supporting characters as is his love for the Black Rose herself, Maryam. The novel is episodic in structure, covering a period of many years. Historical figures like Roger Bacon, Kubli Kahn & King Edward I are referenced. This is a romantic adventure story that is nonstop thrills. By the time I reached page 300, I had to stay up to 4 a.m. to finish the final quarter of the book. I could not put it down. Some of the language was a bit strange with implements used in the Dark Ages referenced, but it gives the novel a good historical grounding. Costain's work is an excellent adventure. Enjoy!"
5,Great Book!,Walter and Tristram go on an adventure from England to Cathay (China) at a time before even Marco Polo. This is one of my favorite books and has been for 10 years.
2,Not Costain's best work.,"This book was a bit of a let down after reading some of Mr. Costain's other works. Somehow I never connected with many of the characters and the story line didn't hold my attention. That being said, I am a fan of Mr. Costain - but he has written other books far more deserving of your time than The Black Rose."
3,Not as good as everyone says,"This seems to be the textbook of choice for a research course for most college instructors. That eliminates being able to choose a better written book of which there are many. I found the text not well organized and at times somewhat confusing with explanations that could have been done with fewer words and far more clarity. Myers' and Hansen's ""Experimental Psychology"" is by far a better choice in my opinion, with better organization, clearer examples and a friendlier style."
5,Fantastic literature,This book is great because it is not soiled and all the pages contain a poem with its theme and pictures.Good for both children and adults. Recommend it for diverse learners and for different age groups.
3,beautiful book,I bought this book for grade 2 children in an elementary school. The poems selected in this book are the typical poems taught and recited in China for Chinese children. The translation is simple and beautiful. It's a good to read aloud for children for feeling different languages.
2,Quite disappointing,"This sounds like a band trying real hard to follow some thrash metal format suggested to them by their record company. There are a few songs on this album that are worth a listen (e.g. Iron Curtain), but overall it lacks originality, a sound of its own.If you like this kind of 80's, very US/macho thrash metal, I would advise you to check out Nasty Savage, Exodus (Bonded by Blood), Savage Grace or Hallow's Eve who were all far better bands than this one."
4,very nice....,"Not quite as sturdy as I thougt, and not good if you are looking for a ton of storage, but easy to assemble, and good space saver. Beautiful too! And great customer service."
1,Have Not Received,"I am very upset because I have not yet received this item. I am hoping someone will help me with this situation. Please, please contact me. I am currently very disapointed and dissatisfied.Have NOT RECEIVED IT. Please help."
1,"Cute, but do they have lead?","I have two of these lunchboxes (the ladybug & penguin), and I think they are super cute. They are a bit on the small side, however, so they don't work for large lunches. BUT, the bigger issue is that lunch boxes that look exactly like these ones, and made by the same manufacturer have been found by the Center for Environmental Health to have high levels of lead.[..]. I haven't tested ours, but I'm no longer using them for kids lunches."
2,print quality,"physically appeared ok. however the print head had dried out and could only get a couple of colors. using the cleaning process did not help, had to soak in alcohol several times and worked breifly then plugged again. Have to continually clean to get it to work, so so."
2,"OK for 6 months, then, caput-","After adjusting for how pink this printer printed photos (had to take the Magenta setting to -15), it was OK for about 6 months. Now, every photo prints incredibly pink. I take photographs of art for a major collection here in Boston. Color matching is very important in my prints. This printer is horrible. By by. Im going to HP.R-"
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this printer two years ago and 1t produced excellent results for the first year. The color quality slowly began to diminsh after that time and eventually required that I perform the head cleaning process before each printing job. I finally received an error message that instructed me that a major malfunction had taken place and to contact customer service. I was then instructed to either ship the unit in for service or consider a new unit. The manufactured would not tell me what the suspected problem was however suggested that it could be the printing head. I believe that not using the printer on a regular bases caused the heads to plug up beyond what the normal deep cleaning process could correct. My advice to anyone who buys into the Canon ink tank system, be sure to print a test page daily and perform the head cleaning process weekly. I don't believe I will own another Canon printer for this reason."
5,Awesome!,"Bought the Canon G5 and i960 printer together. The G5 is great--no complaints--but the i960 is a revelation! Had been using an Epson 785photo printer for 1-2 years and the Canon is 1) faster, 2) quieter, 3) better software, 4) easier to use, 5) lets you print pictures directly from the camera (at least with the G5), 6) has a useful 4X6 slot for direct printing of 4X6 prints and 7) oh, did I mention the pictures? They are fabulous! Far, far better than what I'd been getting with the Epson and I've compared identical pictures on both printers. Prints are sharp and vivid with rich colors that I hadn't thought capable in a photo printer. It's not a printer for text, but for those looking for a quiet, fast, reasonably priced, high quality photo printer, you must check this one out.This is a truly awesome photo printer that has exceeded my expectations in every respect."
5,"It has to be a great printer, cos I own the i950","If anyone is shopping for printers that have absolutely exceptional photo quality without wanting to break the bank, this Canon i960 series printer is top notch. You won't need to process photos at your local photo store anymore. This printer is especially a great buy if you pair it up with a 4 megapixel or higher Canon digital camera. Canon's software is calibrated as such to ensure that highest accuracy between the photo taken and the one you print out on your glossy or matted paper. The colors on a standard 4x6 photo are eye popping -- the blues are really blue, metal is metallic, flesh is fleshy, you get the picture.I personally, am not in the market for a new photo printer right now, because I already own a great Canon Printer from the same family, the i950. But for those shopping for one, and are tired of the so-so output of their HP and Epsons, this model is the one to pick."
4,Easy enough for anyone!,"I got this printer because I read other Amazon.com reviews, and I liked what I read. I found the set-up instructions easy to follow and do. I am a 53-year old grandmother, a baby boomer, and child of the 60's, and a very sheltered Southern Belle. I am ""challenged"" by anything more complicated than ""in/out"" and ""stop/go."" But I set this printer up and printed lovely photos--even different sized ones!One thing that you must get is a Belkin F3U133-06 USB Device Cable (6 FT) (or something) to connect the printer to the computer and the photo paper. Everything else you need is included.I am just learning, but I will write again when I have progressed. The main thing to remember is have fun! I shall give it 5 stars when I feel I have advanced to that caliber."
3,Amazing photo quality on Canon paper only,"Photos printed on Canon paper look like they were developed professionally. They are the best I've ever seen from a photo paper. Photos printed on any other brand of photo paper look pretty shabby, even after fiddling with the printer settings.Printing text is very, very slow on ""normal"" mode and printing envelopes frequently jams the printer."
5,Dear Troglodytes's Reviews,"This is to all the people that have read these reviews. If you notice that all of the 4 Neg reviews have been by one man ""Troglodytes's Reviews"" This printer is way better thatn the Epson printer. You need to try a diffrent printing software. If anything you should only diss on Canons software not the printer.Thanks"
3,It's good quality printing but at slow speed,"Owning a Canon 900 & 9000 I was wanting to add another great printer for faster production. Much to my surprise this is twice as slow as the 900 &9000 (which prints 2 color pages in 1 minute). This does 1 color page per minute, for some reason Canon has slowed this new model down if your looking for speed, this is not your baby."
1,Canon i960 - -Awful -,"This is by far one of the worst purchases I've made...not necessarily Amazon's fault, but not a good printer!! Barely 8 months of mild usage and I have nothing but feed problems....it either does not feed paper or it feeds several sheets at once. Needless to say, I've wasted alot of photo grade paper!! I guess I have an extra boat anchor now."
3,"Too Much ""red"" or ""blue"".","I bought the i960 last year. It will print ""nature"" photos very well -- nature like animals at the zoos. When it comes to printing photos with people, there is entirely too much magenta in the skintones. There is entirely too much cyan in clothing items in the photos of people. I am not as pleased with it as I thought I would be. I am researching other photo printer brands."
5,Stunning pictures with digital SLR,"I purchased this from Amazon, and tried it out last night. It created shockingly good prints from my digital SLR camera, even on full-sized sheets. Set up took a bit longer than expected -- even though the price is reasonable, it's a fairly complex product. Interaction with my Macintosh PowerBook is fantastic. Tried Canon and Kodak paper with it, and the Canon Pro Paper (a sample is included) blew away the Kodak paper. Literally can't tell the difference between a print I had printed by Ofoto and one I made at home."
1,Poor Printer Head / Ink Cartridge Design,I am very disappointed in the Cannon i960 printer. The printer head is very poorly designed. I had great difficulty getting the print head and ink cartridges to work. I had to reseat the printer head 5 times before it would work. I had to reseat the magenta ink cartridge 5 times before it would work. It took 4 hours of reading the manual to diagnose all the errors I was getting and running tests to get this printer where it would print a color picture. Our last printer was an HP 895cse. The HP was easy to set up and ran great for 3 years. I wish we had bought another HP. I am very disappointed in the quality of this printer.
3,Dark colors fade!!!,"Its an excellent printer overall with great picture quality. There is one major drawback... the dark areas fade. I am using OEM ink and Cannon Photo Papper Plus Glossy. I do live in Hawaii but I am not leaving it in direct sunlight. Has anyone else noticed this problem, and if so is there a way to correct it? The reason I am giving it 3 stars and not 5 is I am disappointed with the fact that the colors fade so easily. Again other than that the picture quality is great, and I haven't had any other problems in the 2 months that I have owned this product"
3,Lousy paper feed mechanism,I bought a Canon i960 in June '04 and by September '04 it was jamming every other paper when printing a document. This printer does an excellent job with photo's but don't buy it to print documents. So what I'll end up with is a used (factory reconditioned) printer from Canon for the price of a new one. I'm glad I didn't throw away my 7 year old HP 722C.
2,What can you expect from an inexpensive photo printer,"I bought my Canon I960 on February 11, 2004. Yes I purchased it to print photos. On June 1, 2004, I didn't expect my printhead to go out! Meaning my pictures were coming out with a reddish/pinkish hue. Good thing Canon backs their product with a 1 year limited warranty of which printheads fall under, or I would have been an unhappy camper having to pay $145.00 plus shipping for a new printhead. Otherwise the picture quality is excellent, aside from the printer printing at snails pace."
3,"Printer is the best, but its printhead is the worse","All Canon products are the best comparing to its prices and pictures. However, I have a concern of the new printhead of this printer brand name. The printhead is easy damaged if the user does not use it to print 3 times per week. Because of its new ink technology, the ink as a result will be dried random in its printhead if the user does not use it during a month and a deep clean does not help.Personally, I already had a damaged Canon printhead after 6 months. It failed already on the black and photo cyan colors. If everyone keeps using the Canon photo printers 3 times per week, the users will happy with its pictures for a three-year long. However, I am not because of the cost of Canon inks."
4,Excellent printer for the money,"I read the reviews and did my research. I am very happy with the print quality, using any brand inkjet photo paper. I am a little confused as to why anyone would expect a cable to be included, never seen that one before. Anyone I show the prints to, from this machine, are amazed that they were not done at the local photo shop. I have recommended this printer to others, and have received many thanks for their experiences with this unit as well."
1,NO GOOD,"i am 44 years old. in my case, this product didn't work. i am currently taking another brand which i hope will be better."
5,Hilarious!,"Wish they had more of Don DC Curry! The other artists are funny as well, some are younger shots of current/recent successful comedians, but other than that I would rate it a 8.5. Definitely worth a look!"
2,Not to good,I am actually getting a major in Computer Science and this book was my very first. I think it is a brutal introduction because there is not that much information in the book to help you solve the problems that I think are way too complicated for first timers. I had to get tutoring for the entire semester in order to pass the class and I had to use more than one other book not by the same author to help me understand better what I was doing.
1,This book is a bomb.....,"I was very disappointed in this book. The guy puts his URL in the book and I get a 404 error. Then I send him an e-mail and he never acknowledges it. The laboratories are busy work. They take over an hour each and I did not learn anything from them. They were just to keep you busy. They were not clearly explained. I have worked in IT for 5 years and I was scratching my head most of the time. The topics were scratching the surface and very high level with no substance. At the end of the chapter, I would outline it and it was eight or nine pages explaining something which would have taken me half the page to explain and then it did not explain it clearly. He touched on unimportant concepts and ignored really important and interesting stuff. I pan this book. Terrible. Don't buy it."
2,"Very ""seventies""","Certain tracks a bit ""off the wall"" (pardon the pun) but great for a trip of nastalgia."
2,New Floyd still sucks.,"Ever since the breakup, it is obvious by the re-release of old works that the ideas have dryed up, and the talent has too. Give it up and either become a new band or resolve the differences in the real Pink Floyd."
2,The LP was better,"I'm not going to comment much on the music; you've probably been able to gather that ""Relics"" contains five tracks from the first three Pink Floyd albums plus six non-album tracks from the same time period (1967-69). It's somewhat of an odd collection that I'd give 3-1/2 stars to for just the music.HOWEVER...I'd like to point out some issues that none of the previous reviewers have mentioned. First, this CD has obvious audio defects. ""Interstellar Overdrive"" has at least five audio dropouts. ""Paint Box"" and ""Julia Dream"" each have a moment where one channel loses the high end. To add insult to injury, the track times printed on the CD seem to correspond to the ""More"" CD, not ""Relics"", and the booklet is a complete waste of paper that omits the minimal information (recording dates) from the original US LP.I bought this CD to replace the LP, but in this case the LP was better. Capitol Records should be embarrassed."
4,Contains Rare Songs,"This is still a decent compilation album. It contains Paintbox, Julia Dream, Biding My Time and Careful with That Axe, Eugene (studio version). All are hard to find and thats what makes this great for Floyd completists who have to have everything. Some say the sound quality isnt as great. I dont really hear any noticeable difference at all. Good for Floyd fans and fans of music in general."
4,Maybe the best collection of Floyd songs,"All other Floyd collections offer nothing special, only songs that I could get off the other albums (most of which I own). However, this CD has a bunch of songs that I can't find anywhere else. I will only review these songs (and Careful with that axe)Arnold Layne: Excellent Barrett single about a transvestite. 5/5See Emily Play: Another good Barrett single, not as good as Arnold. Excellent guitar work, although about a minute in, there is some very annoying music (thankfully, it goes away quickly) 4-4.5/5Paintbox: Interesting. Not sure how I feel. Sounds nice. 4/5 (for now)Julia Dream: A beautiful song. 4.5/5Careful With That Axe Eugene: An excellent song, the low rating here is only because of the excellence of the Ummagumma version. 4/5Biding My Time: Beginning is pretty good, but the lack of words for the final fourish minutes is awkward. 3/5"
1,Missed Opportunity,"When the folks at EMI reissued Pink Floyd's Relics on CD they missed a great opportunity to make the definitive Pink Floyd obscurities release. Had they included such gems as Point Me At The Sky, It Would Be So Nice, Apples & Oranges, Nick's Boogie, and Candy And A Currant Bun, this collection would have been as essential as Dark Side or The Wall. This CD is another example of record companies trying to milk as much money out of fans as possible by releasing a few rare songs alongside album tracks.[DW]"
4,"Classic Floyd, though could've been better","Relics is an album of classic Floyd songs from their earlier days, though i think that some songs should've had others in their place, but everybody has their own taste in songs. But any die-hard floyd fan must have this if not just, especially since its the only album that ""Biding my Time"" is on."
5,The best Pink Floyd Album,This album is great! The song Biding My Time is one of the best Floyd songs ever. I think This album is very good. This and Works are both great. I suggest that after buying dark side of the moon you should buy this.
4,Great addition to your PF collection!,"Any die-hard fan of Pink Floyd should complete his/her collection with ""Relics"". It perfectly summarizes the Floyd's early work with classics from ""Piper"" to ""Ummugumma"" (LIVE). It also contains a few really good b-sides, expanding their massive cannon of impressive work. Some of the new songs may seem a little off, but after a few short listens, most of them seem to blend right in. Over all, ""Relics"" is a must for any die-hard fan or person curious of the early days of this legendary band."
5,Capturing the essence of the era,"The timeless quality of these songs written 30 years ago by the band when they were relatively young capture, for me, the naive innocence of the era. The musics' attractiveness is enhanced by the well chosen lyrics, all swimming in an aura of child like wonder,innocence and the joy of living. Those of you who can remember and comprehend the exilaration of the era may recall the profound effect of hearing such unusual, different and inspiring music. I am still moved when I hear them. Only later do Pink Floyd indulge in their compelling theme of bewilderment,sadness and eloquent lament. I constantly marvel at the creativity of Pink Floyd, that continues to this day."
1,Very disapointed,This is one CD that will make a fine drink coaster. I know that some of Pink Floyds recordings are bizzare but in my opinion this disk was a complete waste of money.
1,A boring book with nothing characters,"The main character of this book, Cat, is so incredibly stupid and boring that it made the rest of the book absolutely mundane. In a search for fulfillment in life, Cat goes on a spiritual search and divulges herself in the idea of karma. What is so absurd about this, however, is that while Cat is constantly in search of receiving favorable karmic retribution, she purposefully sleeps with attached men in hopes of breaking up their relationships, but at the same time seems to have NO clue whatsoever that karmic retribution in this case would turn around and burn her.The remainder of the book is a bit boring, and I had trouble keeping track of the other characters because there was nothing defining about them that made them stick out in my mind. I would find myself flipping back to previous pages to jog my memory.Do yourself a favor and read something with more substance to it."
3,The revelation captured me...,"I think that the book was interesting, but it was sort of repetitive. The ending where the main character had her revelation was the best part, because it was partially true. Life is full of struggles and there are life's luxuries that are our pleasures."
5,I loooooooooooved this book!!,Although Cat was a little wierd in the first few chapters (crazy obsession with co worker freaked me out a bit) she was remarkable! She really figures he self out and gets her priorites straight. I absolutly recommend this book. Alexandra Carew did a wonderful job!! Can't wait for her next book!
1,Can I give this book 0 stars?,"Empty, stupid and depressing. Cat, the main character, is hateful. When she starts having suicidal thoughts, you wish she'd just do it already. Full of pseudo-spirituality and yawn-worthy ""revelations,"" this book is the ultimate cure for a chick-lit addiction."
3,;0/,Didn't wow me it was ok something to watch to pass time. I just don't get it though (might be spoiler) how she reached home got out walk around the car to get in the house and not see the guy on the bumper I find that hard to believe it's not like she had a monster truck. Anyway she starts freaking out and gets her boyfriend involve.So ppl PS: don't drink and drive even it's a glass a shot etc. Seriously
1,a stupid mess.,"when i wasted my money on this crap i was expecting more of a good suspense/horror but it was total bore it didn't provide none of that. This boring movie was about a girl getting drunk with her friends and she drives home drunk apparently not knowing she hit someone which the man was dragging under the car the whole time she drove home, she discovers him and instead of doing the right thing like call the cops she tries to hide him while still alive, He comes back and is on a vengeful rage and starts to terrorize the girl, and to top it all off he is bipolar which makes him a even more raving psychopath. this whole movie sucked (i was hoping more of a JOYRIDE type revenge movie) and the ending was very stupid. Do not buy!"
2,Take a Detour Around this One,"This film starts out with an interesting premise. In fact, its premise might almost have allowed it to advertise itself as being ""based on a true story."" There was the actual case of a woman who plowed into a man with her car, then let him die slowly impaled on her hood over a period of hours. This incident could have been the inspiration for a really good story of ghastly, ghostly revenge.However, ""Hit and Run"" doesn't permit itself to gather any momentum from this promising material for horror. After the first half hour or so of suspense, it just runs downhill and degenerates into a rather mindless gore-fest. What's more, a lot of the acting is amateurish. And the boyfriend in the plot is scripted as such a totally unlikable lout, it's impossible to care what happens to him.So all in all, I suggest you pass this one and leave it in your dust."
1,WOW!! How bad was that movie,"Now, to start off im a HUGE scary movie buff, it comes out on video and im going to rent it, no matter what it is. This one isnt even worth getting at a gas station in the $0.99 cent bin. The only plus about the movie is that Kate Beckinsale is in it. NOT WORTH IT!!"
3,Hit And Fun!,"This movie is everything a horror should be. You got some excellect acting, energetic and likable characters, you have your mystery, questions, suspense and plenty of gore. It's got a great soundtrack too and totally worth the watch.The plot is a young girl driving home one night runs her car off the road and doesnt realise until she gets home that she hit someone and they are stuck in her front bumper protection bar. Panicked, she doesnt know what to do, tries to help him but he attacks her and she then proceeds to protect herself and kills him.... or so she thinks. Then like Stephen Kings Creepshow 2 story ""The Hitchiker"" its a game of cat and mouse, paranoia and survival.I think its a fun little flick, get for a Saturday night in with your mates and some popcorn. Its not the most intelligent horror movie you will find but you'll no doubt have a hell of a fun time watching it anyway. 3.5/5 from me."
2,Not worth the money,"I broke my old holster for the Blackberry 7520 after a year of good use. I really loved the factory holster but it was too expensive considering what it is and that I may only use it for a short time as I may upgrade to a newer model soon. Hence, this holster seemed to be a good choice.At first, it looked like it was quality plastic and has the swivel but I was greatly disappointed to see that the holster was designed with the blackberry screen facing OUT and not into your belt.This caused problems as I'm afraid of being in the rain with it or facing having the screen compromised because of its exposure. What a dumb design.You would think that the tab on top of the holster would hold the blackberry in place and it certainly does the job but if the blackberry was out of the holster, the tab is easily compromised in terms of breakage.....which, not even a month, broke off as I laid down.not worth the money for the phone orientation alone."
3,meh,"Well I didn't really expect anything of this album, and I'm glad I didn't. I thought this was pretty boring stuff, I can hardly believe that this got 4 and 1/2 stars when all the songs sound the same. I'd say listen to the guy on the other 3 star review posted. He has it on the money, it could have been lightyears better!Theres a lot of interesting metal out there though, so go for those first. Bands like Skyfire, COB, Kalmah, Wintersun and any of the folk metal bands like Eluveitie, Korpiklaani, Asmegin, Ensiferum and maybe go for some fantasy metal like Bal-Sagoth or Battlelore. Broaden your horizons with better bands like those first, then come back and see if you like this band. My bet is you won't. I guess I've been spoiled. . . Hell, go for the members original bands instead of this stuff, their stuff is way better. . ."
5,I agree with the title of this album,"combining the talents from bands At The Gates, and The Haunted. You just knew you were going to be listening to a great cd. This has found it's way on my top 5 album list. This is arguably the best cd I've heard in a long while, without the cliche' titles."
3,Good overview of the Yablonski murders,"This book provides a good overview of the murders of Joseph ""Jock"" Yablonski, his wife and his daughter. Jock Yablonski ran against the United Mine Workers of America leadership and was killed in retaliation. The book does a decent job of explaining who the various people are and how they connect.Unfortunately, parts of the book are a bit dated. There are some racial characterizations which will make the modern reader cringe, and the author's practice of always describing the appearance of an individual the first time he appears in the story gets a bit tiresome."
4,Fun music!,Only bad thing is tracks are not listed singularly-only 2 tracks with multi songs on each. Music is great for dancing.
5,An astounding adventure story,"In 1937 one Betty Carey embarked on the ultimate adventure, rowing from Puget sound Alaska by dugout canoe but her adventure didn't end there. Her explorations of the Inside Passage and adventures with loggers, lightkeepers, fishermen, missionaries and other residents recounted in Bijaboji: North To Alaska By Oar creates an astounding adventure story armchair readers won't want to miss."
2,A Story of Jealousy,"A woman from nowhere, who is just passing through, sneaks into someone's house and is discovered and welcomed in. She then disrupts the lives of everyone around her."
1,Terrible,I received this product about two weeks ago. I tried hookin it up to my tv but one of the male metal peices was bent and one was missing. Do NOT buy this product!
2,Surprisingly Disappointing Wahl Product,"I have purchased Wahl hair clippers and other items for many years. I'm very surprised that this particular groomer, intended for multi-purpose use, varies between being very ineffective and cutting my skin, but leaving my hair. For now I'm going to stick to the far from perfect Philips Remington body groomer. That product could use some improvement because the shaving cartridge tends to get loose and fall out, but it handles delicate areas much more effectively."
1,not worth buying,this product is terrible. takes 14 hours to charge and loses it's charge after 30 minutes of use. this product is no worth buying. keep away.
2,old school shaver,when i bought this shaver i thought it was their newest and most improved. i was wrong. it is pretty much the same as all other hair clippers i own and doesn't work as well.
1,Unfunctional crap!,I recently bought this trimmer and it never chargedenough for you tu cut any body part maybe mine wasbroken or something but i allready had to throw away mine!ps. It dosent deserve not even one star
4,The Everything Product.,"When you have a product that can do so much that you can't find what next to do, as such it is with this item. This machine has replaced my other grooming equipment COMPLETELY."
2,Poor Quality Shaver,"This product has plastic parts where blades are interchangeable. The plastic parts do not hold up. Within a few months my shaver broke--it's now in the landfill. Look around, don't buy this product--cheaply made."
4,Excellent Cordless Body Trimmer,I recently received this trimmer because I had hair on certain parts of my body that I wanted removed or at least shaved as closely and effortlessly as possible. This trimmer works as advertised and is very affordable. If I could change one thing about this trimmer it would be the head size. I would like to see the head be a little bigger because when you are shaving a large area you want to do it as quickly as possible.
1,Didn't hold a charge,"Used this once, and then it wouldn't work, either plugged in or after recharging. Haven't sought a replacement yet, and I'll give an update if I get some satisfaction. The hair-length attachment is cumbersome to adjust. Miss the old Norelco model that gave up the ghost. Still, this feels sturdy..."
3,Not the best but does it job.,This is not the best product but it sure does it job. Its not very functional for the hair removal on the body as it takes quite a bit and repeated attempts to remove hair. It is a relatively inexpensive option for men. He wasnt exactly super thrilled but it worked.
4,Some unknown classics here,"""Postcard"" and the title track are a bit slow, but overall this is some prime, vintage post-punk. The four-star rating is a comparative one, by the way. I'm basing it on the band's discography, not on an objective 5 point system (i.e., I'm grading on a curve). The angular, jagged art-punk sound of the record is very 1979 (it was recorded in '79 but wasn't released until '80)- think Wire, early Talking Heads, Entertainment-era Gang of Four. Each of those bands were very unique of course, but the next two Comsats albums established a more distinctly Comsats type of sound, a sound that was never quite heard anywhere else (or ever has been)."
5,Must Read,"Even if you already know the story of Goodman, Schwerner, and Chaney, this book is very detailed and interestingly put together. The background information on the freedom summer project and other activists is insightful, and this book reads like a story, and not just as boring facts. I recommend this book to everyone."
4,Only Jim Carrey film I like,"I have never liked Jim Carrey's silly ""Jerry Lewis""-like slap stick silly comdey.... BUT... in this more serious movie, I finally saw a Jim Carrey who can actually do a good job acting.The only Jim Carrey film I like.Nice period piece."
4,Great Film.,"Of all the slapstick comedies that Jim Carry has done, the best film he has done in my opinion is a drama about family, courage, and honor. The Majestic was over looked in the theater, and that is a real shame because not too many movies deal with the kind of courage that it deals with broadly in this film. Jim Carrey really Shows great dramatic chops, Martin Landau is great as always, and should have gotten an Oscar nomination for his role, and Laurie Holden gives a great performance and holds her own with the boys.See it."
4,Absolute Magic!,What a great film. Didn't know what to expect from this film. Darabont did a fantastic directing job. Tattersall's cinematography is breathtaking. Carrey gives his second best acting performance next to Man On The Moon. See this film as soon as you can. It just might bring tears to your eyes.
4,I Was Shocked,"I have never been a huge Jim Carey fan, in fact the only reason I watched this movie is because it was the only one out I hadn't seen. Turn's out I might just have been wrong about Jim Carey, his preformance in this film was outstanding! It turns out the man can actually act he's just had junk roles before now! The movie itself is beautifully done, from the set's to the acting to the cinematography I can't say enough good things about this one!I must say this film was completely underrated, it's 110 percent better then most of the Oscar movies this year! The plot is compelling and unpredictable and totally moving. You'll be missing out if you don't check this one out!"
2,Painfully long,"No one has slammed this movie hard enough, from what I can tell. First off, the issue of Jim Carrey. He's a funny guy. Can also act. We knew this. But to have him do neither in this movie is unconscionable. There's nothing in his character that Jim Carrey could give any of himself to. As has been said here before, anyone could have been in this role, thats how uninvolving it is.Way too long. The drama doesnt start bulding until an hour has passed. Tear jerking is employed. Youre going to have to bring your Suspens-O-Matic to the viewing to process all the disbelief youll be experiencing regularly....the whole town following the reunited lovers...the whole town waiting at the platform when Carrey comes back from Congress...oh, phooey. This is clean family fun, I will admit, if youre an adult without a brain or a high tolerance level for the inane you might finish this two and a half hour affair. Thsi will be Jim Carrey's last film for a while."
2,Yet more whining about the McCarthy era,"I'm so tired of Hollywood whining about the McCarthy era. Most recently it was ""The Contender""; before that, ""The Crucible,"" and before *that,* ""Guilty By Suspicion."" They're like a dog with an old slipper it can't stop chewing. As a somewhat mainstream sometimes-consumer of Hollywood's products, I have a message for Hollywood producers: No one cares about a bunch communists and their fellow travelers who lost their jobs in the 50s!The thirst for victim status manifests itself in far, far too many areas of American society as it is. Hollywood producers, why don't you try to slake that thirst by telling each other at cocktail and coke parties that *you* would have stood in the breach and never given in to political pressure, if only you'd been lucky enough to have been accused. Don't take your desire for victim status out on the rest of us. To paraphrase a famous McCarthy era Hollywood luminary: ""Have you no shame? The McCarthy era is dead!"""
1,Watch me while I pull a rabbit out of this hat!,"Disgusting trash!Women should be very upset about the female love interest's portrayal as a shallow floozy with a fetish for people who resemble her dead hero boyfriend. And communists should be upset that this inbred bit of Hollywood self-diddling (something Woody Allen, in particular, specializes in) chose to belittle their religion. And casualties of war should be upset that they've had to die so that some lookalike can just waltz in and steal your baby and take over your cinema.And for what?So that overly friendly, mostly pale, middle-aged, purposeless country folk can fill their eyeballs up with government-sanctioned, post-war, bargain-of-a-lifetime! propaganda.Yeah, you won, buddy!"
1,Worst movie ever!!!,"I don't even know where to start. This movie is bad in every possible way. The corniest and sappiest plot insults the intelligence of anyone over five years old. It is so predictable and so stupid. I rent on average three movies per week, and I consider myself somewhat of a movie buff. To say that this is the worst movie I have EVER seen should tell you something. I can't believe this is the same director that made ""The Shawshank Redemption"", which is one of my favorite movies. Very, very sad..."
1,Corniest Crime Of The Century (So Far),"This film's first scene actually starts with a bunch of studio execs in an appalling brainstorming session. They are attempting to rewrite the plot for a film they are making (NOT THIS ONE). In the process they create an inept and farfetched story. It struck me as the synopsis for this film. Read other reviews to get the ridiculous plot details for this film. After the REAL writer made his/her pitch for ""The Majestic"", this film should have been canned immediately by the studio."
5,Fantastic!,"I love this movie, Jim Carrey really shines and shows his excellent acting potential outside of a comedy film (not that this isn't comedic at time). A wonderful film and story."
5,Great STORY + Great ACTING = GREAT MOVIE ! ! !,"""THE MAJESTIC""Everyone is fantastic in this movie. Very tight acting and very believable characters. It's easy to care for them and want what they want. Jim Carrey is fantastic, too. He can really bring a tear to the eye when he wants to. He does a SUPERB JOB and I am impressed. I didn't know Ace Ventura had it in him.If you like movies that are meaningful and thought pervoking then I highly recommend 'The Majestic'. Taking a serious movie in, now and then, helps to keep life into perspective. GREAT MOVIE!!!"
4,The Magestic,A great clean movie! Good for the whole family. Makes for a great movie night. Makes me remember why I used to like watching movies!
1,"another Carrey movie, but not the best","Jim Carrey is doing well in the funny role as usual, however this movie is not the best Carrey movie. It is long, or maybe too hollow, or maybe the pace is too slow. At the same time it focusses on just one, rather small place (Lawson), and the time frame is also short . Also there are some political undertones which I could not really always understand. As to the characters, they are are not too ""live"" actually (probably due to the amnesia that stikes Peter/Luke); I was not really impressed by Peter Appleton, Harry Trimble, Irene Teriwilliger, Emmit Smith, Sandra Saint-Clair, Adele Stanton and Lucille Angström Ichtville. The only interesting part of the movie is near the end when Luke (now Mrr Appleton again), reminds us of the 5th and 1st amendments of the Constitution of the United States."
1,Worst Movie of the Year,"What a fool I was not to trust the reviewers. I rarely get mad, but I must admit that I was very [angry] for having wasted [my money] and 2 and 1/2 hours of my life to this piece of... whatever. It's all Jim Carrey mugging, Martin Landau looking really old, and corny political speeches and untruthful sentimentality. I suppose it is retro Frank Capra, but this film is pathetic as compared to classics like ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,"" or ""It Happened One Night."" It's really not just stupid to compare them. It's wrong."
4,Wonderful and touching,"Jim Carrey takes a serious turn in The Majestic. An accident leaves Pete, a Hollywood screenwriter (who is also on the verge of being blacklisted as a Communist), with amnesia and he is welcomed by a small town whose residents believe he is one of their sons come back from the war, Luke. He and his father reopen the town's movie theater, which is a metaphor for bringing the entire town back to life. After months in the town, his own B-movie playing in the theater jogs his memory and forces him to admit to the town that he is not who they think, the same day his beloved father is buried. Pete returns to Hollywood to face the Communist accusations and stands up to the committee in a way Luke would have. The ending brought tears to my eyes and I immediately wanted to watch this movie again. It is a really sweet film and a welcome change."
4,A MOVIE JIM CARREY FANS CAN BE PROUD OF.,All I hear from people is that they didn't like it because he was too serious in this film. You know Jim Carrey is an actor and actors have alot more to offer than just comedy movies. This movie was good altough long it was good either ways. I think this was Jim's second best performance next to Eternal Sunshine. And if you don't like that movie either then maybe you are not the Jim Carrey fan you thought you were. Jim's a good comidian but he is a good actor that should never limit his acting to only comedy.
3,"Good settings, bad script","Funny that a movie about a scriptwriter has a very sweet but unimaginable scenario. From the moment on you have a pretty good idea about what is going to happen. Making the 2,5 hours a long sit.Guy is wanted for communist sympathies - gets amnesia - ends up in a town where they think he is someone else - they find out - he goes back but understands that life is better there than in 1950s LA.The end is even a little too moralizing: The Constitution is open for every belief, even communism!!The acting is however fine, Jim Carrey shows again he is a lot more than the Mask and he almost reaches the standard he set for himself in the superb 'Truman Show', Martin Landau is sweet as his 'father'.The settings of the movie are great, the feeling of the 1950 is perfectly shown. The warm cosiness of a small town glows from the screen and the setting of the movietheater is great.Too bad it's so incredibly predictable."
5,One of the greatest guitar oriented rap records ever,"From the earth-shattering scream in the opening seconds of ""The Fun Lovin' Criminal,"" to the end of ""Methadonia,"" this talented NYC based trio delivers a contemporary rock n' roll classic, full of sharp hooks and intricate beats. This record is one of the most eclectic that has been made in a long while. Drawing on the best elements of hard rock, and urban rap, the FLC create a winning combination. Intelligent songwriting is found throughout the record. The songs here deal with a very wide range of topics, from gangsters, to bank robberies, the lyrics are funny, and witty. Hands down one of the best records of the 1990s, a winning combination of rap and hard rock, perforated with melody, and humor."
5,One of Mexicos Best,This CD is undoubtedly one of the best recordings Antonio Aguilar recorded. If you like the variety of styles Mr. Aguilar recorded then you will love this selection.
2,Not very impressive!!!,"Purchased this Camera expecting it to operate as good or better the the much less expencive BL-C20A did. The picture quality was sub-par for a camera that was 400 dollars more, I expected more. The wireless set up was a ritual in frustration, reset the camera multiple times, repowered, downloaded the updates, packaged it up and am sending it back.I think for a camera that is 650 dollars, it should preform considerably better.The Weather Proofing and WiFi was why I purchased it, so I will look elsewhere for another product."
1,Panasonic BB-HCM-371a,I have owned two of these camera's and neither one ever worked properly. The first once had a main board failure and the second one fails to boot up past the orange light blinbk and then goes solid. This is probable the worst and most problematic camera for the money. There are several others at half the price that are better.
1,Not recommended due to poor security,"I agree with the other reviewers that the lack of wireless WPA security is inexcusable. I wish I had known that before purchasing this unit. I have two other indoor Panasonic cameras and they all have WPA so I did not even think to check if this one had it.I upgraded to the latest firmware released in 2010 and still no WPA security.For those who are not familiar with the limitations of the inadequate WEP security that this camera has, if you don't mind people breaking into your networks and stealing information, then you don't need to worry about it."
3,Decent Noir Reading,"If you like film noir, you would most likely enjoy this book. It's a bit cliche, but it's good as a summer read."
3,Tongue-in-cheek Spoof,"A really cute tongue-in-cheek spoof of the tough private eye genera. I did read it all the way through. However I did get tired of the constant smart-mouth replies. Started to sympathize with the bad guys. Certainly would not want to be around that all the time. The plot was gimmicky but enjoyable. All in all, worth reading."
2,Tall Dolores,"I didn't get very far in this book so it's a little unfair to say it stinks. Lets just say it wasn't my cup of tea. It seemed like every line of dialogue spoken by every body, but especially our hero, was a wise crack. And not funny wise cracks, just wise cracks. Maybe some enjoy that style of flippancy but I don't."
4,Lynx - Varied Power Pop & Rock Classic,"Bought all three Lynx releases in the used bin. Had no idea who they were. What a pleasant surprise. Lynx was a Canadian band working in the late 1970s that are tough to classify. Try this on for size - some Donnie Iris influences (tight harmonies and guitar work) with a bit of BTO on a couple of rockers, a bit of Journey thrown in and a really dandy update of the Stairway To Heaven riff - Hold On. The production quality is crystal clear. Nice use of synths and keys when appropriate. The guitarist is fast but tasteful - melodic riffing. Thundermug comes to mind - another under-rated Canadian band that combined a number of 60s and 70s influences into several rock-pop classics (remember their Move tribute - Orbit?). After a couple of listens, Lynx is in my top 50 overall bands. Wondered what happened to the guitarist? He seemed to get better and better over the course of these three releases."
3,NOT Baby Einstein,"If you have purchased all of the real Baby Einstein videos and are searching anything similar, buy these, otherwise buy Baby Einstein first, they're better.I felt defrauded when I realized I had not purchased another Baby Einstein, but another company which had chosen a nearly suspiciously similar name.This became painfully obvious when the tape started, because of the annoying, intrusive introduction and low-quality ""animation"" (more like bits of drawing slid around the screen) which interrupt the flow of the video every few minutes.Overall, these videos are as similar to the ""real thing"" as the name (read; unoriginal), but the few differences hurt instead of helping. Quite a shame."
2,"Mothers, lets be frank.","To be frank--music good, video non engaging.To compare--videos that are worse:So Smart SeriesBaby Einstein vol. 1 Baby EinsteinBee Smart Baby SeriesBaby's First ImpressionsBrainy BabyVideos that are better:Baby Dolittle 6 months-3 yearsBaby Know-It-All Smartypants 6 months-3 1/2 yearsBaby Know-It-All Lil Bloomer 6 months-3 1/2 yearsBaby Van Gogh 6 months-1 1/2 yearsBlues Clues Big Musical Movie 1 1/2 yr. plusBlues Clues Arts and Crafts 1 1/2 yr. plusBilingual Baby any of them 1-2 1/2 years"
1,Boring,"My child loves the Baby Einstein series -- I bought this video because I thought it would be unique. Unfortunately, it's poorly produced and has not come close to being original. I'm sorry to have purchased it, and my son is completely bored by it."
1,Poor video,"A friend gave this to me. The first time we watched it was when my daughter was about 6 months. She wasn't impressed and neither was I (although I do enjoy the music). I decided to add it to the rotation of Baby Einstein and Curious Buddies that we have - for which my daughter, now 19 months, is glued to the TV. It came up today and after 2 minutes she was off playing with toys and had no interest whatsoever. Sorry my friend wasted her money. It's going in the donation box."
4,I won't lie,"I got this book on a whim from a local book store. Being from Florida, I'm always on the look-out for Florida authors. Sure, these stories have some problems. It's something I'd expect from a new author. But, I have to say that the stories moved along at a good pace, and each is compelling in its own way. And one of them, ""The Weight of Boys"" just about made me cry it was so good. I can't give this book a five-star rating because it's just not Faulkner or Hemingway or Gogol. But if you're looking for a bright, new voice in American fiction, I'd say that you give this guy a try. You really won't be disappointed."
3,Never used,Bought on impulse never installed trying to sell on craigslist. the amp seemed to be the best priced with the features i wanted.
5,Best Documentary,this order arrived promptly and in good order. This is probably the best doucmentary we have ever seen. He was an incredible person.
5,A Great American Success Story!,I saw this film on PBS and subsequently watched it on DVD several times. I find it incredibly inspiring to see how a poor boy from the Lower East side of Manhattan defined his own destiny and found tremendous success in life.This copy is a gift for friends who will love the story equally.
2,Filthy Dirty!,"Rudy Ray Moore is so graphic on this CD that you can smell what he's talking about! Hold on to your stomachs, folks, he makes Redd Foxx sound like the Pope! His claim to (in)fame(y) is the godfather of gangster rap. This dubious honor is well deserved.Record a conversation of loudmouthed, illiterate drunks on the street corner and you'll get the same result."
1,Rudy Ray Moore's Greatest Hits,"Rudy Ray Moore's comedy is not for everyone, just what he does. Baudy and Irreverant to say the least. Small Minded Humor."
4,"Hey, wanna hear something funny?","I'm serious here. Rudy Ray is probably the funniest (and most vulgar) comedian I've ever heard. Told mostly through rhymes, Rudy Ray (a.k.a Dolemite) tells stories of pimps, badasses, and lions, and smartass monkies. You've never heard anything funnier than the time the signifying monkey tried (unsucceesfully) to tell the lion what was up. There's also another version of the Titanic that the movie didn't cover. One of my personal favorites was the tale of Petey Wheatstraw the Devi's Son-in-Law, the BADDEST pimp who ever lived.Known as the ""godfather of hip-hop"" Rudy Ray Moore was the first comedians to ever use four-letter words in his acts. Though some of his tales get a little formulaic (Petey Wheatstraw and Dolemite are VERY similar), they're nevertheless hilarious and inventive. Just check this out. This is a great party album that you DO NOT want to play for your girlfriend, unless you want to get dumped (trust me)."
1,Guarunteed Broken in shipping,"This Delco speaker is packaged in an oversized box with no protection inside.. so it rattles from end to end. The Amazon shipper places that box in a double sized box, with the inner box positoined against one end, with bubble wrap filling the void on the other side. Where the damage occurs I cannot say... but the first part received had on mounting tab broken off - the broken piece was still in the box. The replacement speaker arrived with the snap mount broken off, again the broken piece was still in the box. I jury-rigged a way to mount the speaker, using 2 tab/holes and drilling new holes in the door mounting bracket and applying sheet metal screws. It's not as robust, but I suspect I could go on forever returning this part and receiving replacement parts that are also broken."
5,Chapel Road,"A complex but very rewarding book. There are 3 story lines, all at different times in history, but all set in the same part of Flanders, in Belgium, and all portraying a similar image of injustice and despair. Although they may seem unrelated, the attentive reader will soon discover the links. It is one of the most important books of contemporary Dutch literature. However, readers who dislike modernist may want to stay clear of this one. Personally, I do not care much for modernist fiction, but for Louis Paul Boon I am willing to make a big exception, as this is an exceptionally warm and at times humerous book"
5,words are few,"words are few, when it comes down to reviewing one of the masterpieces of 20th century writing. It is an absolute shame this book and its author is only known to specialists and freaks, even in the authors home-counrty belgium. read it and tell everyone you know how beautifull, tragic, inspiring, funny, confusing, touching and superb it is. and tell them how it changed your life. this is an absolute masterpiece, if kafka is a 20th century classic, or hemingway or joyce or who-ever, then louis-paul boon is too, no doubt whatsoever."
3,Too technical for me,"I'm sure this book is great, but it's above my head. It's too technical. I couldn't get through it, so I re-sold it on eBay to a military air traffic controller who seemed to like it."
2,Some miscasting; wrong director; too American,"Much as I loved Hillary Swank in ""Boys Don't Cry"", she should not have been cast in this movie. She's too contemporary, too American, and not believable as a scheming, manipulative social climber.Christopher Walken has a Gary Oldman hairdo, and a strange role. He also is miscast.The film is beautifully shot, the costumes are gorgeous, but the uneven accents and inconsistent performances are annoying."
1,Amazon Needs Human Copy Editors!,"This should be a decent movie of 118 minutes, but Amazon's inventory of rentals was exclusively populated by 15-minute offerings. Amazing, that Amazon wouldn't have anyone loading these feed rentals would notice the copy that read: ""Run Time, 15 minutes."" Clearly, this made the viewing experience dreadful."
1,hate it,it was only 14 minute long. I thought I was going to watch a full movie. If I knew it was going to be 14 minute long I would not have order it.
1,Watch it with a blindfold and ear plugs.,"What a noxious mess! This hideous disaster of a movie is the perfect example of why Hollywood should forget period films and stick to guns and car chases. Much has been made of Swank's blank-faced performance, but the real failure here is the script. It reeks, and no matter how it's dressed up, the director, actors, costumers, etc. could not turn this pile of bull's droppings into gold (literally, the film cost 20 million to make and grossed 400K). The failure begins with the writer's half-baked idea of taking a fascinating true story and perverting it, transforming the assorted cast of villians (who were motivated purely by greed) into some kind pop-culture heroes. Hence the confusing plot that never ads up to anything believable. Hence Swank's dismal attempt at turning a thief into a saint. Hence the cartoonish dialogue and ham-fisted acting all-around. Do yourselves a favor and skip this one. Read the real story, instead. It's much more entertaining."
2,"Hollywood, get REAL.","American actors butchered the British dialect in this film. Could have been worse I suppose, they might have tried to fake french accents. We should be thankful we were spared that. How did the casting call read, ...If you can get past the burlesque the movie isn't half bad, costumes are magnificent. BUT the drifting back and forth from American to English ruined it for me. Only Jodie Foster could have done worse."
2,Swank flubs it...or is it the script she was given? Yawn.,"Oh, dear. Here's a story and a time in history that should be fabulously dramatic and impossible to ignore. However, that is exactly what I did. I turned it off a third of the way through. I don't think it's the cast. The writing is just insufferably boring. Watch at your own risk. Truly a waste of time."
5,An Affair To Remember,"I try not to buy movies that I haven't seen yet for fear of being stuck with a bad film, but I took a chance with this movie and I was right at doing it. The movie was wonderful and the acting was very good. Many scenes in the movie have a dramatic feel to it that really sets up your emotions. The music is also powerful. If you like history or movies made by true events then I surely recommend people buy this film. When watching this movie you need to pay attention to the diagloue. Missing one scene could get you confused. If you seen it once and didn't like it I recommend you watch it again (alone if possible) and listen carefully. It's a movie worth it."
3,"Beautiful, historical film","While it's not academy award material, I truly enjoyed this film. The costumes and on-location scenes were gorgeous and the story is intriguing--especially because it is true. While the director milked every bit of drama out of each scene possible, Hilary Swank's performance remained poised, if a bit aloof. If you like historical costume dramas, you will enjoy this movie."
3,The straw that broke the camels back.....,"The Affair of the Necklace' chronicles the attempt of 18th century Jeanne Valois to reclaim the estate and good name of her family after its seizure by the pre-revolution French crown. This is supposed to be the affair, which precipitated the fall of Marie Antoinette. And the scenes of the infamous Cagliostro, the legendary sooth sayer/wizard of the times, who helps Jeanne Valois maneuver so that she can her family estates and titles. The famous 2800-carat necklace that was the center of the controversy between the Queen and Cardinal Rohan.The based on a true story...and fun to watch. The script could have easily been written to a higher standard. Though you can see that no expenses were spared in the costumes. Still, there are some intriguing moments in the film. And it did peak my interest to look more into the period.So what more can you ask. Fun to watch, somewhat historical and interesting enough to make you want to look further."
3,Period Piece Based od Historical Fact,"This movie was well acted by a cast of well-known actors, wonderful costuming & cinematography and a must see if you love period pieces based on historical fact.The only major draw back to this movie for me was how slow the storyline seemed to movie and its predictability.... If the movie wasn't so slow or predictable then I would have given it a much higher rating than 3 stars!"
3,The Affair of the Necklace,"I loved the movie! But, I did not like the way it was shipped to me. This is the first one I have ever had a complaint about and I order from Amazon quit a bit!!! It did not come with the cover when it was shipped to me!!! It was just placed in the envelope!! I am very upset about this. The movie itself (luckliey)was unharmed and it plays very well.Thanks,M.Fox"
2,What the heck?,"This film had all the makings of a fabulous film, but something is just wrong. The musical score fails to fit what we are presented with, swank give a so so performance. Don't waste your money buying."
2,Period costumes and music save it,"For those who know me, if I am disappointed with a period film, it has to be bad. I was waiting for this one to come out on DVD because it was only released in art house theatres (as usual). So I rented it--and I was glad I didn't waste my time in the theatre. The story was boring, the actors were so-so, but the scenery, costumes, and soundtrack were absolutely beautiful. Too bad they were used on this, rather than something more exciting within the same time period, like a big-screen adaptaion of ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" (NOT the musical)."
5,Better than the picture,"The bags are so practical, pretty, fashionable, excellent for both mom and dad, all products inside are reachable, the diaper bag inside is a great addition. Love it!"
5,"BEAUTIFUL, PRACTICAL","I love these bags. I carry both if I'm going to be gone for any period of time. The larger stays in the car with formula, diaper, outfits, and I carry the smaller one in the stores with 1 diaper, 1 bottle, or anything else I may need for that short priod of time. It's great to have everything you need but not have to carry it in every store. And it matches the travel system great. I love this set."
3,"Not My Kind Of Movie, But It Has Its Good Moments.","Note: I saw this movie on HBO.This remake of a film released in 1984 which I've not seen is okay. Personally, it's not my kind of film. I saw it because I wanted to know why people were making such a big deal about this remake. It's an okay movie. Worth a one-time viewing only. Not the best or worst movie I've seen (the worst movie I've seen & in my opinion the worst movie ever made is the 1983 Scarface). Rated R."
1,This movie is a joke,come on seriously? i couldnt even sit down and watch it.this movie is so pathetic. robert englund will always be freddy krueger.. they should of not even made this film.. i actually got pissed.. this movie has nothing to do with anything from any of the other films. it took a whole new direaction. and the actors and actresses were so fake and didnt even act.the original krueger movies he was a pedophile and was arrested but realeased becuz someone didnt sign the search warrent and he was free to go.. so the parents of springwood burned him down at his job at a boiler type factory. OMG. i hate hate this new movie and no wonder robert englund didnt want to star in it and this isnt meant to offend anyone but if you like the movie IM SORRY ...you must not be familiar with the other movies... lol
3,This Nightmare Actually Wasn't That Bad...,"To be honest, the updated/remake of Nightmare on Elm Street wasn't as horrible as the other reviewers have made it out to be. The new Freddy is pretty wicked looking and can be funny at moments with phrases like ""How's this for a wet dream.."" The actors did a very good job at portraying their characters, most notable, Kyle Gallner, who played Quentin. I saw this movie twice in theaters, and the sencond time through I wasn't bored or anything. The only problem I had with the movie is that they could of included more death scenes and scary moments that make people jump. But I wasn't disappointed. I recommend this movie to Freddy fans and to people who enjoy horror films."
4,I actually looked forward to this...,"...and I wasn't disappointed!! It wasn't the best remake ever but it stayed faithful to the series pretty much. If you've see the original, you can seen what was taken from that, what was changed & the different ending. I can't say too much without giving it away but it was a good movie. I don't regret paying my $8.00 (student priced tickets! Booya!). I think people should see it & give it a chance before judging it. Some people hear ""remake"" & automatically shut down thinking it won't be good.If anything, I think the movie was more funny than scary but some comic relief is good. It lets your guard down. XD I still think Robert Englund is the best Freddy Krueger but Jackie Earle Haley wasn't terrible. I will buy the DVD when it comes out."
3,its fine,"A Nightmare on Elm Street is an alright Remake that has more story telling than the Older movies. :)I dont know if I should recommend this or not, so I'm gonna say nothing more."
4,Better then the original and I loved the original!,This movie took a good story and modernized it with the latest actors and actrists as well as modern special effect.I loved it.
2,"Whew, Remakes","I can barely sit through this movie. When I first watched it, I thought it was just because I was tired. But no, the movie itself is boring. It feels like TO MUCH of a fantasy world, and my eye tired of the generic, thoughtless scenes. Maybe I'm being harsh, but I just couldn't dig this movie. The second time I watched it, I turned it off half way through and wished I had never spent the money."
3,laugh at my review,you will laugh at me for this but... i didnt even see the movie yet (i will dont worry) but this review is for the dvd cover... I NEVER SEEN a CLASSIC cover like this...this is the most CLASSIC cover i have ever seen in my life...had to let you know. ----UPDATE : i saw the movie today and it is so so...it's boring a little.only the freddy parts are entertaining.
1,heroin addicts on Elm st.,"The original Nightmare on Elm Street is one of the greatest horror films ever made. This film is a disgrace. Nancy and her friends are all anorexic, pill popping heroin addicts this time around and it's hard to feel sorry for them. Nancy in the original movie was a hero, the only one willing to stand up to Freddy and fight back. In this movie, they make her seem like a wimp. Not only are Freddy's victims terrible, but the new Freddy is so pathetic compare to the Robert Englund's Freddy. Maybe rent this movie from the library if you have seen the originals and want more."
3,ok movie,yeah i got it because i live the other nightmares and had to have it to complet. if you are first timer to the movies. dont get it.
3,Connie Britton!!,I'll keep this short and sweet- Connie Britton is a freakin goddess! The best thing about this sub par flick.
3,Freddie is a wimp next to Pinhead of Hellraiser,"This movie is all right, but I'm lukewarm to it for various reasons. I bought the movie really only for comparison with Hellraiser with which I have been familiar. I find Freddie's frighful scenes scary, but the intensity doesn't match my expectation."
2,Not good.,A Nightmare on Elm Street.. Now I have never been attracted to this series so I generally didn't expect a wow movie but this was just crap. I do not recommend this movie. 2 stars
3,Good flick,It was an entertaining piece of horror. A little cheesy but of course it is to be expected in this genre.
4,)ne Two Freddys coming for u!!!!,I think this was a great remake of the 1984 film. Here's my opinion;1.They went into more detail about what Freddy had done before he was murdered.2.They went back in time and we saw him playing with the children without his horrible face.3. This Freddy waws pretty scary. But Robert Englund will alway be my favorite.4. Freddy may be a bit darker in this franchise but he was still able to crack a joke or two!!!I wasn't a big fan of the Nancy character only because the Nancy fron the 1984 movie was tough and more outspoken. This Nancy seemed to be shy and uncomfortable.Besides those few things I thought it was a great remake. I will be hoping for a part 2 considering how the movie ended.
3,Could haver been better,"I am a huge fan of the original movie, but I am also one of those people who can appreciate remakes because I like to see what they can do with new special effects and better equipment. My boyfriend and I rented this movie for that very reason, in the end we both felt it was nothing special. I thought the story was fleshed out a little more than in the original movie, Freddy was exposed for the pervert he actually was and they had some well shot, creepy scenes. However, Nancy was terrible! She made the character boring and often expressionless, nothing compared to Heather Langenkamp. Freddy's makeup made him look like a fish... The original makeup was much more realistic and Englund's signature pose made Freddy unique. I thought that Freddy talking so much took some of the creepiness out of the character, but the taunting was interesting.I think this movie is ok if you watch it keeping in mind that it won't be like the original."
3,Some parts are good...some are bad.,"I got this movie out of pure excitement because of the first movie. However, I knew it was not going to be good after watching the opening scene. Normally, I like it when a movie gets more into the plot in the beginning than just jump right in. If you're looking for a movie with blood, than it's a great movie. Other than that, I prefer the first movie!"
2,If it weren't for Robert Englund we wouldn't be talking here....,"...and I guess that pretty well sums it up for me. I'm a big NOES fan and saw the original batch of films. Now comes this remake. Look, I understand Robert Englund couldn't play Freddy forever and that Jackie Earle Haley is an excellent actor. That being said, I also believe there are just some movies that you shouldn't remake. I think Nightmare and the Freddy character falls into this particular realm. Robert Englund's personality made Freddy a bit better than he was, if that makes any sense. With Jackie Earle Haley, Freddy becomes just another sick child molester. Bottom line, expect no surprises and expect to feel a bit empty when you get to the end of this film."
2,Not Good,"Being a horror fan of many, many years I conclude that this re-make is not very good at all, on the edge of crap. Watched it twice, saw twice as many dislikes. I don't like this Freddy, don't like any of the characters nor do I care for the back story concocted for this mess, absolutely horrible. I can save some of you time here: New ""how Freddy became"" story is garbage, actors not very convincing, film really felt rushed and of course Freddy, something about him that I did not like from the start."
5,I liked it...,"I dread most remakes. I did not care at all for the new Friday the 13th. This isn't the greatest movie in the world. This isn't the classic Nightmare we all grew up with. It isn't meant to be. That being said, I liked it. Even I was surprised, but I really did enjoy this movie. Bought the Blu-Ray to add to my collection. Everyone has an opnion, respectfully, some will like it, some won't. I did."
3,A Nightmare On Elm Street(2010),This new nightmare is not as good as the original it was still okay. I will buy it just for the collection it was some what entertaing i still think the original had more of a sinister fill to it. I do have to agree that Jackie Earl haley did a pretty good job playing freddy. But i think one thing i will have to get used to is the new look i guess if they kept him the same look people might of liked it better. well all in all it was okay. i have to say this one thing Rob Zombie should do remakes to all horror movies. He did awesome on Halloween. ps. robert englund will always be freddy. jackie earl haley did not do a bad job. it was not the acting it was the story. they basicaly did the same thing twice. it would of been better if they did more of an origin story like what rob zombie did on halloween. if you have not seen this movie i recommend you do.
1,Yawn,"This storyline was already familiar. Now that I think about it, there was nothing that was said here that wasn't already said in the first 10 Freddy Krueger films.Save your money."
1,A Nightmare......on any street anywhere.....,Movies this bad are easy to review. Nothing more to say than that it just plain sucked.Nightmare never need to be redone. It was a cash grab and I the only positive thing is that I rented it from my local video store (Queen Video in Toronto).The cast was horrible. The dialogue......well it seems like that room of monkeys on typewriters finally churned out something.....this script.Freddy's new look was actually kinda cool. But the second he opened up his mouth to try and come with clever one liner.....ugh - hilarity.Pass on this or rent the first one.Truly awful excuse of a remake and not recommended for anyone with a brain.
2,DIDNT LIKE THE REMAKE!!!,"actually had high hopes for this remake. It didn't take long of actually sitting in the theater for those hopes to be shot straight out of the sky. My main gripe is with the redesign of Freddie. He looks like Jim Carrey's Grinch That Stole Christmas. Nothing about his appearance was at all frightening. It looked far too plastic and fake. How do special effects from two decades ago look better than anything we can put together now? It is sad really. And they gave him way too many lines in the movie. Less is more when it comes to horror villains. Especially when you have such horrible dialogue as ""Why are you screaming? I haven't even cut you yet."" Freddy's one liners are enough to kill this movie on their own. In fact I could have forgiven the terrible acting from the other stars, the cheesy gore effects and the ridiculous story details the new movie added..... if only they hadn't turned the centerpiece of the series into such a joke."
4,Not quite what I expected,"Ok, I really to put this movie as a 3.5Pros: 4 starsChange in the main storyline from the originalThe micro nap concept, that is pretty coolFreddy seems much darker and not as much of a comedian as the original Freddy.Some jumpy moments caused some girls in the theatre to scream. I jumped a little myself actually.Cons: 3 starsNo creative kills. In today's technological world and improved special effects, I would like to have seen some better kills. Alot of borrowed kills from the original.The movie dragged some in the beginning.The idea that if you are awake long enough you will go into a coma and never wake up. That was lame.The dream sequences were ok, but I would have liked to see some more creativity there too.Other then a few jumpy moments that most ""scary"" movies have, I didn't find myself scared watching this movie. I long for a movie to have that effect on me. Very hard to come by these days."
2,Disappointing,"Michael Bay should stick to big Hollywood action movies. The only character I cared about was Kristen. The new Nancy has no energy and you could care less if she dies. I wish that they did what Rob Zombie did with Halloween. He actually made a whole different movie. Jackie Earle Haley did a good job with the material he was given, but Robert Englund is Freddy. For the Love of God stop remaking the classic horror movies.I Give it 2 out of 5 it's entertaining when nothing else is on."
2,Freddy is back but gone is the imagination that launched the franchise to stardom,"This movie has a few alright moments. But that's like saying you caught a blue gill when you where aiming for a bas. Jackie Earl Haley puts foward a respectable effort as the new Freddy but not even that can salvage this film from the train wreck it is. The plot attempts to coax you into believing things you obviously won't fall for,unless you have no idea what the whole franchise is ,and in the twenty first century movie goers know what this character and his gruesome story is about.Despite all the downfalls that plague this movie i'm still a little curious to see a sequel.Just to see what they would do with it."
2,Friday,"It's good for a view every now and then, never gonna be a classic but I like horror flicks. It was also only 4 bucks....and Bluray."
3,OK remake rent instead of buying,"I am a horror fan of all movies, and this film had a lot of potential and felt rushed. Love how they recalled Freddy's secrets... they stuck for the most part with the original film.. original is much better!!"
3,Blu ray review,"I'm not reviewing the movie, just blu ray release in general... Decent special features and a great picture... Downside is no unrated or extended edition... There's a lot of cool scenes in the featurettes that weren't in the movie which is dissapointing... They should realist now that people want a bunch of added scenes when the movie comes out to buy. With that said I was very dissapointed in the release but the movie is not bad, freddys pretty creepy in this one..."
2,Bootleg Feddy,"This movie was horrible compared to the original Nightmare on Elm street movies. Freddy does not look like freddy at all...I know the original actor for Freddy is old, but I thought they should have gotten someone closer to his body build, and features. This freddy was super skinny, and his face looks nothing like him. What a bore!"
2,NEW FREDDY.,"In response to MR LOCO.If you were really a Freddy fan, You'd know that the back story had never changed. They just played it up a bit more.Freddy was always a pedophile, they just never use that word to describe him. Go back and watch Freddy vs Jason. The opening scene: the licks a pic of a little girl. before killing a live one. Later on in the film: he fondles with his glove hand the main female character and says, your mouth says no, but your bod says yes.Also: In the films there is a little girl saying he likes little children. Especially little girls. Through out the years, there were always the little girl victims who jump roped. Like said. It's always been there. Just like a puzzle. You just have to piece it together."
1,One of the worst remakes,"I have to say this is one of the worst remakes in horror films. Effects wise it was good, but they butchered Freddy's backstory which was unnecessary but made Freddy less of villain. I'm sorry, but making him a child molester instead of a child killer in his human life was utterly ridiculous and took the scary edge off him. And like the remake of Halloween 1 & 2, you really didn't care about the characters and whether they were killed or not.When the movie finished all I thought was WTF? It was a remake that never should have happened."
3,"It's Alright, But Not As Great As The Original","I personally don't like this movie as much as the original. They could of made this remake way better than they did. Even with better actors than they chose. They should have brought back Robert Englund from the original series, because I think no one can take his place as Freddy Kruger, no one can slay like he does, he's the best. This movie didn't scare me at all, but the original did. It would have been better if they didn't make a remake at all, because nothing will ever top the original A Nightmare on Elm St. I don't even see the point in making some remakes of movies. All I can hope for is that they don't remake the whole series, because it would be a shame. Overall I thought this movie was alright, but the remake is not my cup of tea, and not scary at all."
2,the old freddy's dead,what happen to freddy's sense of humor in the original series he would make jokes through the movie on this he just makes comments like after he killed the dog he siad nice puppy.the people who are fans of the original series this is not the film for you.but if you not a fan of the original series you will might like this
2,Could have been a lot better,"Feel like the 80s and early 90s Freddy Krueger appearance looked a lot better than this one. Not to sound rude, but Freddy's voice was annoying in this one."
2,Constant streaming interruptions,The movie itself was like remake but the streaming interruptions were constant and annoying. Amazon's movies on demand normally pretty smooth but this one didn't meet the standards.
3,decent remake,"A bit dark and lacks the campy charm of the original, but also not scary (because it lacks suspense). Thankfully, it wasn't gory. Just okay."
1,Absolutely terrible!!,"I have seen a lot of this original series and loved them. I borrowed this one from my local library since I usually hate remakes of horror movies and this was no exception. This remake is the worse than the Jason remake. I mean, the movie nearly put me to sleep I was so bored with it. You can't have a Freddy with Englund. I'm sorry, but you just can't. This was a remake they should not have even been thought up. This movie is a disgrace to the genre and I would recommend you all spare the hour and a half and do something else more worth your while. I'm I watched it to ward others away from it, but please save yourself the embarrassment and don't watch this pathetic excuse for a movie!!"
1,sucked,"it sucked...it was boreing, no tongue in cheek humor like the org. movies the female lead didnt act very well....the guy who played Freddy was good....save ur money or go rent the org...."
3,Only a decent remake/reboot,"Eh, this is a so-so remake/reboot of A Nightmare on Elm Street. It isn't nearly as good as the original, but it's better than most of the original's sequels. It followed the original story well enough, but not as much as I'd of liked. Non of the characters really seemed to be 'characterized', they seemed kinda flat. Didn't really care about who lived or died. It didn't seem to be as suspenseful either. But, for what was there, and for how it followed the original, it did a decent job. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
2,This is not a movie review,"I bought this item thinking it was a regular DVD. When it came in the mail, the DVD case had RENTAL in large print across the bottom. The DVD itself also said rental on it, which means it has no special features. The product page says nothing about this being a rental copy, and the picture displayed does not say Rental on it like the item I received."
5,Very good remake!,"I loved this movie! The remake is amazing! I watched this 2 times in theaters and couldn't wait to buy this on blu-ray! Very suspenseful and at times, will make you jump! Perfect for around Halloween or any time of the year!"
2,Oh my goodness!,First of all with His dolla store mask yes dolla store.Robert England should sue.The mask was off the voice the everything.Proves there is nothing like the classics.I am so glad I did NOT pay movie theatre prices I would have been so p'd.This Freddy Kruger would have been running from me trying to get my money back.As you would say in the 90'sHATED IT!
1,Total disappointment,"I ran to see this movie the day it came out. I have been a Nightmare on Elm street lover since a child, watching and re-watching all the original movies over and over again and never getting tired of it. I waited with anticipation, trying to relive my childhood horror movies.The first disappointment was that there was no Robert Englund! He was so missed in this movie. Any Nightmare on Elm street movie MUST have Robert Englund, there even wasn't a cameo.The movie itself was an okay horror movie, only that it can not nor should it have been named A Nightmare On Elm street, this movie is not in any caliber with the original movie. You will have a few scare and jumps but nothing like the original horror movie we knew from the 80's, which unfortunately that type of horror was what I was waiting for.Enjoy seeing it"
1,worst,This is the worst remake ever. Not scared not anything...lousy....I can't even put it into words. Robert Englund is the man....This SUCKS.
2,Ok but.....,Its a great movie for what it is....my only issue with the dvd is they did not state it was a rental special and didnt have anything but the movie on it or that it stated on the case on the dvd its self that it was a rental dvd only reason it got two stars was its not a bootleg and has the movie on it i would of opted for another disc if I had known it said rental all over the case and disc
3,A Moderate Horror Film!,"Jackie Earle Haley made a good impression of Freddy Kreuger, but he does not present the classic wise-cracking Freddy everyone loves and fears. Also, instead of being a completely new film with a new plot, it turned out to steal scenes from some of the other Nightmare on Elm Street films like Freddy coming out of the wall above the main character and Freddy's hand creeping out of the bath tub. Once again, Michael Bay has disappointed me! Still, this was a film that kept you wondering where Freddy will appear and slash his victim.The Young Guardians and the Genesis Spell"
2,"Well made technically, but not that good.","I didn't like this much at all. The film itself was very well made and much of the dream stuff looked very good, but it lacked the the scares of the early Freddy films, and lacked the fun of the later ones. I'm not against remakes and reinterpretation, but this had nothing old, and really nothing new. it was mostly boring.the new guy playing Freddy seemed to be trying but the script didn't really give him much to go with. Skip it."
2,A Remake to Kill the Fans...,"It was as if none of these people ever even the originals. The movie is not scary at all just mostly a quick stab and kill with extra blood to make some more gore. The dialogue is stupid and not believable. Freddy rarely speaks and when he does its some pointless chessy line. The acting is semi believable when the ""teens"" are trying to be scared in their dreams or awake. But just wasn't that great. Terrible unscary intro to the movie too. Even the ending to how they ""kill"" Freddy is cheesy since all that's done is his glove hand is cut off and his throat is sliced real quick. But after that at the very end obviously they show that he's still alive. I would give this movie a C-."
2,"LOVE Jackie, Don't love the new Freddy.","I adore Jackie Earle Haley as an actor. He's one of the best, I actually enjoyed the whole cast, but I don't appreciate them trying to recreate Freddy. I understand that they were trying to make him scarier, but that's just not who Freddy is. He's a little scary at times, but he also likes to crack jokes at every opportunity. That's just who Freddy is, it doesn't work any other way. They might as well try to create a whole new villain with Freddy's MO... never mind, I don't want them doing that either. Just, leave Freddy alone. ROBERT FOREVER."
4,THE RETURN OF FREDDY KRUEGER,freddy is back and this time hes saying good bye to 1 liners and nes power gloves now in this true remake freddy is back to his old self like he was in the 1st but still not the same but thats a good thing haley will be the new freddy for years to come i hope his acting was the best in the film sum of the other actors where poor but the movie is good i will be buying this dvd
2,Remake,"This is a remake of the 1984 film of the same name, only Freddy's body count film becomes predictable. Though at least credit the film makers for trying to update the tired Nightmare film franchise. Robert Englund is missing in the cast as lead villain Freddy Krueger and the new guy's makeup and costume are much more ""ghetto,"" giving it a little old school feeling. Worth seeing once for horror buffs, but overall the film wasn't satisfying, or scary."
4,A nightmare on elm street,"Undoubtedly you've read some bad reviews about this movie, but they are unfounded. Having seen the original ""Freddy"" movies with Robert Englund, this new version trumps it in spades. Jackie Earle Haley (Rorschach in ""Watchmen) dons the clawed hand in this new addition to Wes Craven's horror camp. Finally we see the origins of Krueger and why he's just so angry at the world. As with many horror films, the victims are almost obnoxiously stupid, but if they were smart, we wouldn't be half as scared right. I highly recommend this movie, If you loved the original then you'll love this film. But don't see it alone"
1,Sleeping On Your Back Won't Help,"Platinum Dunes never let their scripts leave the marketing department; they threw thousands of dollars for the trades to read, ""Watchmen actor and Nirvana director prepare for restlessness in Nightmare reboot"", but never cared if either Jackie Earle Haley or Sam Bayer were right for the job. They weren't. Bayer can't seem to find a tripod or pacing and Haley's decided to play every character with a Rorschach croak. But even if they'd gotten different talent there's no saving a movie with a script congealed in a scab writer's gutter.So what is Freddy all about this time? Our Twilight cast approach the audience, point to the burned scarecrow in the gay Christmas sweater and say as somberly as possible, ""He touched me."" That's it. No vibrant mindbenders or interesting kills or character arcs or knife hand building. Krueger was a sexual torturer, the kids he diddled turn eighteen and the chase continues.This hits the bottom of remake hell with a dull thud."
2,Good for a matinée and nothing more!!!,"Yeah. Where is Robert England when you need him? Probably somewhere shaking his head at this. This Freddy remake didn't do it for me. It wasn't totally awful but it wasn't that great either. The acting was mediocre and forgettable and I really didn't connect with any of the characters the way I did in the old series. The new mask Freddy has looks terrible. It looks as if somebody chewed a bunch of Bazooka gum and just slapped it on the actor's face. And the guy that played him sounded as if he had candy in his mouth during the whole film. That was a major distraction for me. To sum up, this is okay to watch if you are bored out of your mind and you simply can't find anything better to do. But I wouldn't waste too much gas traveling to the theater to catch this one. If you just have to see this please go see it at the matinée price or better yet wait till it comes on HBO."
2,An Unneeded and Pointless Remake,Jackie Earle Haley actually did a pretty good job in this. Other than that this is a mediocre excuse for a remake that just tries to replicate some of the original scenes while leaving certain ones out(Johnny Depp being sucked into the bed and coming out in a blood geyser). Meanwhile it turns Freddy into a pedophile instead of just a child-killer like the original. The blood and other special effects also don't work as well as they did in the original. CGI blood usually doesn't look good.While this isn't quite as bad as Freddy's Dead it is pretty close making it the second worst of the series.Overall this was a pointless remake of the original horror classic that should have never been made. If you feel a need to watch it because you're a Freddy fan rent this but definately do not buy this film.
4,No for the purists-J.E.H was brilliant,"I loved the NOES reboot.Usually, as it's been mentioned by other readers here, I'm wary of remakes. There were aspects of this movie I didn't like (such as the rotating room/girlfriend murder scene. This new one was hollow and stale), but I will say, even having not seen him in Watchmen before hand, Jackie Earl was BRILLIANT.People are comparing JEH's Freddy to Englunds Freddy, but what people are failing to see with this reboot is that the makers wanted to distance themselves from a comic Freddy and go strait for true grit and suspense. They succeeded with Jackie and his artistry. Englunds Freddy I laughed at as a kid. I doubt had I of seen JEH's freddy when I was 7 I could say I'd of done the same.Four stars for JEH's performance. Minus one for Nancy's shallow and the screw up of the iconic murder-on-the-ceiling scene."
4,Can't go wrong,"What can I say. This book is amazing. The transcriptions are fantastic and there are awesome images throughout the book. The only minor thing I would change is its binding. It's a bit tight. Being a piano book, I would have preferred a spiral bind or something easier to keep open."
5,Well organized. Easy to use.,This is a very helpful tool for anyone wanting to enhance their communication skills.
4,It works like it is supposed to,"If you want a heart rate monitor for when you are vigoriously working out, you need a chest strap model like Polar. This monitor works as it should. You have to stop to take a reading. I have found this model to be a good performing monitor, easy to see readout, and a great price."
3,Colorfull Faeries,"The drawings of the faeries in this book are beautiful, and very colorfull.But, there are no directions for the use of the patterns.Still, it is a very nice addition to the collection of those who love faeries."
4,Lots of Web-specific Detail for the Advanced Programmer,">>Layout: good and easy to follow >>Content Relavence: I found the material to be very well put together and relavent to the topic of web related database design >>Examples: While not as detailed as a beginner would have liked, the examples were sufficient enough for an intermediate to advanced programmer to follow (hence the book's ""Accomplished to Expert"" User Level rating. >>Accompanying CD-ROM: Good examples with lots of source to see just how it's done.. This went a long way in assisting me in understanding other (larger) databases in Perl and Rexx. >>Price/Value: A bit pricey (but then again every technical book in Canada is). I found it close to the worth the money that I paid!"
5,A book directed chiefly to the families of Anorexia Nervosa,"20 years ago being a parent to an Anorexia Nervosa patient often meant being subjected to scrutiny bordering on assumption that there must be some family ""problem"", overenmeshment etc. causing the child's illness. Dr. Luca's book sets the story straight and is genuinely helpful to parent's struggling with this disorder in an offspring, e.g. p 17, ""Work with patient's) parents focused on helping them to cope better with Andrea's illness and on assuring them that they were not at fault.""This book is written in a very readable style and, reflecting Dr. Luca's academic credentials, it is accurate and informative.I enthusiastically recommend it to my patients & their families."
4,Bleeding of the Stone,"Set in southwestern Libya near Ghat, ""The Bleeding of the Stone"" is the life story of an isolated Bedouin herdsman. Faced with the absurdities of modern life, herdsman Asouf is forced to examine every aspect of his life and beliefs in deciding how to respond. Testimony to a lifestye rapidly disappearing in Libya and elsewhere in North Africa and the Middle East, the protagonist prizes the purity and simplicy of bedouin life and identifies closely with the creatures found in the desert. The first of Ibrahim al-Koni's novels to be translated into English, it is hoped this novel will be followed by many more."
1,It was not the item I`ve bought.,I`ve received a male/male cable and I need a male/female cable extention. It`s not worth to return it because It`s too cheap for the time needed. Hope this helps for someone else.
5,Good product,"After searching similar products, I decided to buy this item. Excellent price, product arrived on time, good quality construction. Exact what I wanted."
1,"Wrong item shipped, total waste of my time!","I was shipped a standard male to male VGA cable, not the M/F extension I ordered. When I try to return the item on Amazon's website I get into a loop where I keep being told the item requires ""special handling"" and then sent back to the Return Center for another go-round.Thanks for wasting my time guys. You've been warned people."
1,Ordered a M/F cable and received a M/M cable.,"I ordered a Male/Female Monitor cable with the express shipping. Received the item within 2 days; however, it is the wrong cable. The one I received is a Male/Male ?"
1,Dead on Arrival,"I took the sander out of the box and had used it for about ten minutes when it shut itself off and that was that.I had to ship it back to the manufacturer at my expense and who knows how long it will take to hear from them or getit replaced/fixed. I've had good luck with reconditioned products in the past; however, this was a huge disappointment.It was nice while it lasted. If you need a sander for a pending project, don't buy this one unless it's brand new!"
2,"It's just what I bought the ""cheap one""","I'm completely disappointed of buying this product. I saw it really cheap and I took the risk and turned out that it was a bad product. You could still use it if you are going to transfer images on white T-shirts, but if your looking for good quality transfer paper do not buy this one. This has a clear background, which means that if you try to transfer the image to a color T-shirt, you won't be able to see it (you will only see a Dark shape). However, If you don't mind to transfer your image on a white T-shirt and your image to come out a little rough, go right ahead and buy it. At least it took me out of a problem."
5,Love it,"Just noticed no reviews of this, so just want to say there are some really great five-star tracks on here, specifically After Sunrise, Crickets Sing Anamaria, Blues A Volente, Adam Adam, Zanzibar, and Upa Neguinho. The rest are pretty good too, except for three that are so-so. Just my opinion, but there you have it."
4,A dose of bittersweet reality,"This book was above my almost-four-year-olds head, but I can see the positive educational impact it might have for older children in a classroom setting - perhaps children learning about life in war-torn countries.The illustrations are beautiful and the story is bittersweet - there's war going on all around the poor narrator and the future is so frightening and uncertain. A neighbor - a cellist - makes a brave move to brighten the lives of his neighbors - just a little bit - and help make them feel less afraid.I'd recommend this book for mid-level gradeschoolers and be prepared to discuss this further with them, using current/recent events for examples."
5,Excellent book,This is an excellent book about how music calms the spirits of children and their families in a war torn country. This story is written in such a way that it could take place in any country or city undergoing war.
2,didn't help me,This is a very talked about cough remedy but for me it did not work. The taste is also terrible
2,Tin is VERY difficult to open,"I'm a long-time user of Thayer's lozenges, and thought the tin might be nice n my purse. Two problems: tin is quite large, and is impractical due to its nearly impossible to open design flaw. I'm afraid they missed the boat on the packaging, but lozenges were high quality as always."
4,dry mouth treatment,this product helps with the treatment of the uncomfortable feeling of dry mouth. The taste is mild and allowing one to dissolve in you mouth lasts for quite a while. I was glad to find this online as it is no longer available in local stores where we live.
1,Lozenges,"I had read about this lozenges and had anticipated that they would taste good. I don't know if what I received was old and stale, but they are unedible. Don't buy them."
1,mythoughts,My 92 year old motherinlaw has been complaining about dry mouth so I thought I would give this a try. My wife took a lozenge as well as my motherinlaw at the same time. My wife is sick to her stomach in bed and was considering going to the emergency room. My motherinlaw complained of feeling stomach cramps and dizziness. The lozenges have been placed in the trash.
5,You can't have a house without a foundation,"Merle Haggard is one of the pillars upon which country music is built upon, making this collection a must for any serious fan of the genre."
5,Merle Haggard just the best,"I remember Merle from the Club 21 in Natioal City, CA. when he was just getting his start in the music busines. Merle and Bonney would do shows togeather at times, he was great then and still is. By the way I was the bartender and spent a few nights in TJ drinking with Merle so I kind of got to know him a little."
4,"Disturbing, But Good","Have you ever listened to music that just made you feel all creepy? Well, when I heard ""Branded Man"", that's what happened. He sings that if he doesn't tell the authorities where he is all the time and forever, they'll send him back to prison. It makes you wonder what he did.Don't get me wrong, this is really good stuff. But it makes me feel a little bit dirty.You should buy this. Sometimes it's good to feel weird."
2,Not a good cover of Haggard's Career,I cant believe I wasted my money on this box. It does a a lousy job of covering anything other then his Capitol years (doesnt surprise me being a Capitol box set) and I dont believe it even does a good job of that. Its a good thing its out of print and I wouldnt recommend anyone wasting their time trying to find a copy.
2,I Love Merle Haggerd,I love this guy I think his music is total boss. To bad there ain't no more Okie from Masgokie on the tube anymore. I used to sing along to that song in my station wagon all the time. Great music from a man of many talents.
4,Nice Sandal.Good Price.,"Nice sandal at a fairly decent price.Wait till they go on sale if you can as the price seems to fluctuate.Also,buy a 1/2 size bigger too as they seem to run a little smaller than usual."
4,College Text Book,"We began looking for this book as soon as my wife found out it would be required for her English class at the community college. It arrived in excellent condition with the exception of a little smudge on the cover that was easily cleaned off with a wet rag. The only thing I would do different is use a little faster shipping method rather than the standard shipping. I thought that seeing how the store it was coming from was in Auburn Washington and we were in Spokane washington it would only take a couple days to get, in plenty of time before her classes started. It finally did arrive, the Saturday before her first class the following Monday. I have found Amazon.com a great resource for obtaining text books at a fraction of what they would cost new. Great place to save money, even if you use expedited shipping it is still probably going to cost you less than buying it brand new. Thanks Amazon."
4,Lunch Cooler,I am very pleased with the ebags TechWeave Lunch Cooler. It is spacious enough to hold a good size lunch. It looks very nice too. I like the Pomegranate color. I have had compliments from co-workers. It is worth the price.
3,"Not bad, but could be better.","It works, but need more cowbell!Heating element doesn't go all the way around the handlebar. Wish it did.Also wish there was more heat. I have seen OEM heated grips from various manufacturers that provide more heat. These get warm, but not hot.Better than nothing, but wish it performed a little bit better."
4,Well received gift,"I bought this as a gift for my dad, who really loves the song ""Cielito Lindo"". This version of the song isn't his favorite, but he said there are about 6 songs that he has grown to really like. I have never listened to the CD, but I would recommend the product based on his review."
4,"good, though somewhat redundant album","I'm an admitted enthusiast of John Coltrane's relatively aggressive recordings of his last years. Fans of 'Trane's post-Classic Quartet work will find the two cuts on which he appears to be quite satisfying. There weren't too many opportunities to document the musical exchanges between Trane, Pharoah Sanders, Alice, Jimmy Garrison, and Rashied Ali, so this album definitely fills in a much needed gap. Needless to say, those performances are quite spirited. Unfortunately two of these cuts also appear on the U.S. release of Alice Coltrane's ""Monastic Trio"" album, thus making this release seem somewhat redundant, especially given its steep price tag. Worth acquiring for devoted fans of late-period Coltrane. Others might want to skip this release and hope that the album in some form or another is given a proper U.S. release."
3,"COSMIC MUSIC: good, but confusing (3.5 stars)","the first 2 songs are incredible with track 2 being the standout. amazing. John is a revelation here. the final two songs are already released on Alice Coltrane records. why are they here? sure, they are good songs, but i don't see much point in grouping them together. but the music contained is great."
4,Lots of Info on Shih Tzu,Jo Ann White is the Shih Tzu expert! This book tells you everything you need to know about the Shih Tzu. A must have for someone who is seriously considering this breed of dog.
4,"ABC does hard rock? New Wave ""Metal"" with Sax.","I remember seeing that written in a review on this album when it came out. Naturally, I bought the record because of it. It's definitely a unique collection of songs and certainly a far cry from what you'd expect from this band. The real star on this record is the studio drummer, Andy Numark, the master of the 4-piece drum kit. Although not much technically challenging about the songs, each song features a ""big"" sound - similar to Bonham's big drum sound. Otherwise, the songs feature big, crunchy guitars and saxophones intertwining: kind of an unusual texture and definitely a matter of taste. This collection is a departure from the new wave pop sound by which you recognize them - it may as well be another band. Somehow, this worked against them - their notion of what was to come next wasn't in alignment with what the world was ready for. Personally, I liked this album better than any of their other stuff. Saxophone-haters should avoid this."
3,Okay....,"I can undertand why this album is quite misunderstood. The beat did not quite match their debut album ""Lexicon of Love"". However, I did like the hits ""That Was Then, But This Is Now"", ""Unzip"", and ""S. O. S."", so I'm not too disappointed."
3,Not that bad...,"Lets be honest, Lexicon of Love was one of the best albums of all time, when you`ve been to the moon, what else is left? This is a perfectly adequate collections of songs, and is worth the price for the immortal lyric ""cant complain, mustnt grumble, help yourself to another piece of apple crumble"".. well... try an listen to it as if you didnt know that Lexicon existed.. go on, dare you.."
3,An album with great potential but dissappoints in the end.,"ABC's second LP starts off as a good attempt to distance itself from the romantic influences of the ""Lexicon of Love."" In fact, the first 3 tracks -- although too harsh for ""lexicon"" fans -- are a brilliant attempt to combine Martin Frye's rythmic and lyrical genius with a attacking lead guitar. After listening to ""If I Ever Thought You Would be Lonely,"" you begin to anticipate greatness. Unfortunately - with the exception of the mini-hit ""S.O.S."" ,the rest of the album is a bit dissappointing. Although some people have referred to ""Beauty Stab"" as a failure, it did produce 4 great songs that never get boring."
4,A Loving Homage to one of music's BEST ALBUMS!,"Najee creates the songs from Wonder's Grammy-winning tour de force so closely that it's hard to distinguish some from their original versions. All that's needed are Stevie's vocals and harmonica. There is very little variation, with only ""Sir Duke"" having a jazzier take, obviously a tribute to both Wonder and Ellington.The saxophonist/flautist is in top form here. He's not just a ""black Kenny G"". There is more soul and jazz in these performances than Mr. G has ever done in his long and popular career.These ""songs"" are worthy to be heard!"
5,Najee Plays Songs From the Key of Life: A Tribute to Stevie Wonder,"This is one of the best CDs I have ever heard! I love the songs, the arrangements, the instrumentation. I listen to it frequently, whether I'm in the car, at work, at home. It's great!"
3,Not worth twice the price of Attics (Quick Guides).,"Published by the same press as ""Attics"" (Creative Homeowner Press) this book has lovely color illustrations, but adds little to the simpler book."
3,Not too bad,"While I did enjoy watching the film, being an avid Jackie Chan fan I found that the information that I recieved in the film was not anything I did not know before. I was also quite disapointed by the cheaply created opening and cut scenes. The voice over for some of the injury videos was also quite appaling.If you dont know much about Jackie Chan though it has some very interesting parts about his injuries and most dangerous stunts.I would have liked him to go more indepth about his family life and history in the Chinese Opera School though.Bela"
4,Great teaching tool,"If you are teaching (or interested in learning about) Medieval and Renaissance musical instruments, this is a valuable tool. It consists of performances of realized or existing pieces from both historical periods using instruments alone and in various authentic combinations with and without voices. I teach Music History at a music conservatory and find that this is a wonderful supplement to Grout/Palisca/Burkholder's A History of Western Music. I use the recording along with a PowerPoint presentation I've created with various images of the instruments being played by modern players and in period iconography. The ""Dictionary"" also has a nicely detailed booklet with useful supplementary information on the instruments, their uses, and the literature. Most importantly, the performances are high calibre. Fortunately, what it does not do, is have a narrator or a demonstration of instruments playing scales."
1,Sloppy but introductory,"I bought this book and another about SS7 to try and learn a subject I knew little about.After a few pages, I began to wonder about all the typos. It has all the appearance of never being proofread; it obviously hadn't been run through a word processor's spelling corrector. It looks like the prior version was mechanically scanned.I think I found several inconsistencies in the content as well; inconsistent diagrams, for example. Also it fails to answer some obvious questions in the course of explanation.So I don't know if there's a competitive book that introduces all the material in 200 pages; but I'd suggest you spend more and read more and have more confidence that what you are reading is correct."
1,Bad Times at Northern Tool,"This platform truck is a good truck, if you can get one. When I ordered on from northern tool, the shipping company damaged it and it was undeliverable. The second one came a week later and was missing parts. When I asked the company if they could just sent the parts, they said it wouyld take 6-8 weeks because the parts had to shipped from CHINA!!! I couldn't believe that they couldn't just go into the warehouse and get some screws out of another box. So they ended up shipping me another one. This is about a month after I had sent the original order in. So that one arrived and we refused it becase it was damaged as well. We then tried to get our money back, but we had to send the one unit back and they had to receive it at their warehouse. End of story, it has been almost 8 weeks now since I ordered and I have no platform truck and no money. THANKS A LOT NORTHERN TOOL."
5,Book,"I haven't read the book yet, but I am so excited to read it. It will help me with working with a nonverbal student. The book came on time and in great condition."
4,Nice bench.,"This bench is really sharp looking. It goes from 90 degrees to a decline of 17 degrees, just like advertised. Some benches I researched had handles that prevented the decline or just didn't decline as advertised. So I was very pleased that this bench does indeed work as it's supposed to. Another feature I like is the removable leg hold-down brace for added decline position support. Assembly is required, and wasn't that bad. The directions were fairly good, and one person was all that was needed. I agree with other reviewers about the wheels; you have to raise the bench up quite a bit to make them useful. Other than that, I really don't have anything bad to say about this product."
4,Bowflex SelectTech 5.1,"This is a very good workout bench. Like previous posters stated, it is very sturdy and does not wobble at all. I would buy it again."
4,On to the weights,The product was excellent well built. There should have been exercises with it or opportunity for videos that displayed exercises for the bench.
3,"Ok, not great","Feels cheap, took a few weeks for the smell of the plastic to go away. Seat wobbles a little when I bench regardless of how tight the nuts are attaching it. I use this with my select tech dumbbells. Next time I'd look for something with a solid, welded frame with cushions pre-attached."
5,BOWFLEX SELECT TECH ADJUSTABLE BENCH SERIES 5.1,"This bench adjusts to 6 different positions. It's sturdy & great for crunches too. The wheels work fine on any type of smooth floor surface but not so much on carpet. Just lift it up in the front, & roll it back. Fits nicely in the corner of a room. Fairly easy to assemble. The split that separates the back from the seat could be improved upon though. It's uncomfortable in certain positions but not enough to warrant returning the item. This is a keeper!"
4,Solid bench. A bit long,"A very solid bench. Built well, near commercial quality. The box was completely shredded and felt lucky that all of the parts were in there.The back leg is too long. I am unable to use it with my Smith Machine as the back leg hits the support struts.As a free standing bench for fly's etc.. I would say absolutely. Also was a bit disappointed that it did not provide a decline position just 5 flat to full incline bench.I ended up picking up a similar Marcy Bench off craigslist for $40 and use that with my smith machine and this is now my floating bench used for fly's etc.Great bench if you have the space for something this big, and aren't trying to use it with a smith machine."
4,Bowflex,"Good, solid bench. Easy setupHowever, No real need for the three extra positions provided in the 5.1 as opposed to the 3.1."
4,Fashion Worthy but not worth the Cash,Looks good but cost way too much! Other benches with the same features for less is what I would buy the next time.
5,GREATEST BENCH EVER!!!!,"PROS-Great positions-Sturdy frame-Easy to move-Easy to buildCONS-NONEFINAL WORDSA must have, no other bench like it."
4,Bowflex weight bench,"good quality, good variety of adjustment angles, nice to have a flat - incline - decline 'all in one' work out bench."
4,Very good all-purpose bench,"I purchased this bench with the intention of being able to complete a solid dumbell workout on those days that I could not get to my local gym. The assembly instructions are clear (which apparently is an improvement). The bench is easily assembled in about an hour. The construction is solid and there is no significant wobble. Position adjustments are quick. Although the gap between the butt and back pad bothers some people, it does not seem to be a major issue with me. As others have mentioned, the bench does not move on its roller wheels very well. All in all, the quality of this bench is comparable to what one would find in most fitness centers."
4,Love this exercise bench!,"I absolutely love this exercise bench. It was very easy to assemble, with all the tools needed included in the package. Because it's easy to change the seating angles on this bench, I don't have to spend a lot of time fiddling with adjusting pins. Paired with the bowflex selecttech dumbbells, I've been able to cut down my workout time drastically (which is quite important due to my busy schedule). My one gripe (shared by a number of other reviewers) is that you have to practically raise the bench vertically in order to make use of the wheels in order to move the bench. I try to store my bench in my walk in closet, so transporting it in/out does take some effort. But overall, I'm thoroughly pleased with this product."
3,good,Versatile and very sturdy. I would reccommend a mat to go underneath if you plan on using it on carpet to save wear and tear. I only wonder how long the cover on it will last because it seems medium tickness but great so far.
1,Beware of Quality Control Problems,"One would think: a sturdy weight bench, manufactured by a well-known and respected company. A simple piece of equipment with simple assembly -- that is, assuming the parts fit together. The bench I ordered was defective. The front bracket was far too narrow and misshapen to accept the front stabilizer bar. The heavy steel bracket displayed no damage or paint chipping, suggesting that the problem occurred at the point of manufacture. And it's not an easy fix. This is clearly a quality control problem -- since one finds so few separate parts to be checked for quality. Buyer beware."
5,Nice Bench,"I was a little concerned about the bench being sturdy and hard to assemble after reading reviews. However, this is a great product. It went together very easily and is a very solid and high quality bench. I really like it. Some complain about the gap between the back and the seat parts, but there is not much that can be done about that. The gap is needed to allow the seat to move upright. A towel will probably help. I like the fact that the seat can tilt up to keep you from sliding out. I look forward to a great workout."
5,"Little More Than I wanted To Spend, But Well Worth It","I'm 5'11, 230lbs, large build, on a budget.I searched 2 months all over Amazon and the net for a bench that was solid, not expensive, and would support me without the rattle or shakes that you would expect from cheap benches. I initially didn't want to spend no more than $150, but after reading some of the reviews on this and others, I told myself you get what you pay for and decided on the Bowflex 5.1.I've had it for a month now and I am glad I decided to pay a bit more for quality. It's solid, supports my head for flat bench presses, doesn't rattle at all (helps if you buy some floor matts), looks and functions like gym quality benches (If not better). Has more options in angles for incline than the cheaper benches. I would reccomend it for anyone looking for a quality bench but are afraid to pay $230."
4,Well made and sturdy,"Well worth the price. Very sturdy bench that allows you to do every type of exercise you expect in an incline bench. Only con is the somewhat high price you are paying for the ""Bowflex"" name. I would recommend this bench to others."
1,Received Damaged,The cushions on this product were damaged. I sure hate buying something for close to $200 that is not in perfect condition. This was to be a Christmas present so I am not sure what to do with it now?
3,Bowflex SelectTech Adjustable Bench Series 5.1,"bench is nice very good and strong but when I got home and seen how it came, I thought the ups truck must of been in a tornado because the box was destroyed. All was there but my seat cushion had a small tare in it.. thinking about returning it. most likely UPS fault."
4,Very nice bench,"Only problem is that mine is difficult to get it up to the top position. Other than that, it is fully functioning."
4,Great Bench,"This bench is pricier than the other benches. The only con I had was fighting to get the screws in. Other than that, I love this bench. It doesnt slip, does not slide when using it.The extra bar added is GREAT for doing situps and locking your legs in place."
5,Gym Quality at Home,"Tough, high-quality, adjustable bench. At the time I bought this, I was over 300lbs and regularly used this bench for 200+lb work. It is very well engineered & solid.Highly recommend this product."
4,Perfect for Home Gym,This is a perfectly useful bench for use in a home gym. It is customizable into a number of different positions to allow the user to perfrom a variety of exercises.
5,Everything I thought it was,"It has great appeal to it and matches my Selecttech weights. Like others have addressed, it has a gap between the seat part and the adjustable back part which I wasn't really expecting but you need it to allot for the 90 degree position of the adjustable back part. For those like me who were concerned about the decline position on the bench being nothing useful, I was quite happy with the degree of decline on it that could be used for decline crunches or decline bench. I just might have to sell my Selecttech dumb bell set for the heavier, newer model Nautilus has designed. After a certain time, you'll be wanting to do the same."
4,Great bench!,"The bench works great. An issue that I've experienced though is that the plastic stoppers on the adjustment bar fall off whenever you change the bench's incline setting. The bench is also a little taller than other benches I've used before. I am 6' tall and have an inseam of 33"". I usually like to lay a couple of inches lower than what I do on this bench. But, it's just my preference."
2,Quality Control / Customer Service Issues,"My bench was unfortunately defective right out of the box. (The wheels on the rear stabilizer were completely bent by about 20 deg, so they could not roll at all.) My assembly instructions were apparently also incomplete, because when I called customer service to request a repair part, they told me I should first send in the registration form from the last few pages of my instruction book, which I did not have. Finally, they just let me fax in a copy of my sales receipt, and I was supposed to receive a replacement part in 6-10 days. After 6 weeks, I still have not received a thing. I have called back and started the whole process over again, and we'll see if it's any different this time."
3,Seat Gap,"Though I'm a fan of the dumbbells I also purchased 5.1 workout bench which I feel is just ok. For the most part it's fully functional, however there's a gap between the upper part and the seat that just feels uncomfortable. I would purchase an extra piece to slide in there when I use 90% of the bench workouts, instead on the one or two exercises when I have the chair fully reclined. Currently I just roll up a towel to place there, but for a $200 piece of equipment this shouldn't be a requirement."
4,Great Bench,"So there is definitely an issue with the position of the seat on the bench, but nothing worth complaining about. For the price, this is definitely one of the top contenders, it feels sturdy, I have no question about its stability and construction.Highly recommended"
3,Talk about a rocky start to a marriage. . .,"This marriage has a horrid beginning. The first love scene is a bit rough. The characters do indeed hate each other. In fact with as much as they hate each other in the beginning, they have no right to be as in love with each other as they are by the end. Actually, I'm amazed that Balogh pulled it off. I liked both characters by the end despite how terrible they were at the beginning, and that has to take talent. Not Balogh's best, but still very readable."
1,Annoying - not entertaining,"Most hateful, spiteful, mean-mouthed, bitchy heroine EVER. I honestly only finished the book because I was hoping the hero would slap her. The words most often used to describe her in the book are marble statue and ice cold. She blames the hero for everything and makes the monumentally bad decision to make his life miserable by never letting him forget it. So while the hero is left trying to make something livable out of a bad situation, she pouts and complains and says nasty things to him. Even with this going on the author decides to write in sex scenes which are really just uncomfortable since you know she hates him and can't wait to say something mean and sarcastic just to ruin the mood. Hated it."
3,Not my Fave Mary Balogh,"Im a Mary Balogh fan, but this is probably my least favorite story yet. It had great potential, but seemed to fall short for some reason.I always expect 5 stars from her books, stories, characters, plot, etc, but this one is not one I will reread with any regularity as I do the others!"
3,Gentleman?,"The hero and heroine did not like each other at the start for their own reasons. Due to his intense dislike, Randolph does not treat her with care when they first come together. He actually feels bad afterward for being rough with her. This made it hard for me to like him in the end. I wanted to like him and I wanted to believe that he was this fine upstanding gentleman, but my thoughts kept going back to that first time with them. I think a true gentleman would not behave like that, no matter how mad he was or how much he felt he hated the other person. I did tear up at the end, but more for her grief than for their newfound love. The rest of the book in regards to her family was pleasant to read. I felt that the character of Randolph was conflicting and that made it hard to cheer for them."
3,"Just okay story, but the Christmas scenes were nice","I liked the concept of this book and particularly enjoyed the first part of the book. After the marriage though, the plot became quite trite, predictable and boring (filler). I did enjoy the heavy emphasis on the Christmas season, along with heartwarming family traditions. Might be worth reading if you need a holiday fix right before Christmas."
4,Good mental challenge,"Although this game does involve reflexes and timing, it's really more of a puzzle than an action game. In each level, it is necessary to figure out where to go and what to do to get to the end. Many of these puzzles are very imaginative and interesting. Many times our whole family would sit down and watch, giving suggestions and advice, while I tried to complete the latest level.My biggest gripe: the second-to-last level (of about 28) is a ""mini-game"" that requires very quick reflexes and precise timing. The trouble is, the game doesn't respond to the controls precisely enough to make the level playable. Even with 7 lives, I don't know if I'll ever finish that level.Even with that, the game was fun for the whole family, even those who were just watching."
2,Not happy!,"I'm extremely pleased with my Parrish cake pan, but this pan has disappointed me. It bakes well but already has a dent and a few pits (tiny holes) even though I didn't make anything acidic in it!!! Very poor quality."
1,Look somewhere else for model barbed wire,"The fault with this product must be with the manufacturer and not with the seller, because the quality of the ""barbed wire"" is just awful. It's plastic, so the tiny, feather-like ""barbs"" are so feeble that there are sections that have no barbs at all, it was just a big disappointment and a waste of time and money. I'm not sure that it's possible to get realistic plastic barbed wire at all, after seeing this attempt at it."
1,Batteries died in less than one year.,One of the batteries died in less than six months. The others started failing shortly after that. The batteries are very expensive. I had solar lights before this that lasted for many years without failing. This is planned obsolescence and environmentally irresponsible. I wrote to Malibu but never received an answer. Water leaks into all of them.
5,What a great Album!,"What a great Album! If you're a Tull fan you probably already have this one, we wore out the first one and this is in the same perfect shape as the original!"
4,Typically excellent Tull release.,"Contrary to some of the reviews below, ""Too Old..."" is actually a very good album with some terrific musical moments. Ian is at his cynical best, both lyrically and vocally, and the band plays superbly. ""Salamander,"" ""Pied Piper,"" ""Crazed Institution""... these are all great songs. And the title track is a classic. While not as brilliant as ""Songs from the Wood"" or ""Thick As A Brick,"" ""Too Old..."" is still a great addition to your Tull library."
4,A very fun Tull record,"This record, apart from one abominable song (Bad Eyed 'n' Loveless), is great. It's one of the more fun Tull records, and a good one to listen to when you're feeling down (at least for me). Very Upbeat."
2,Not as promised!,"I saw the kit in the picture and that is what I wanted -- The case, book and cards as seen. I just got the book. I was very disappointed and felt the ad was deceitful. When I wrote to them, the didn't respond very well-- they sent only part of the product. Their response was that they were sorry for the condition of the book but I had not even mentioned that. I asked for a full refund (shipping and cost) and at least I got a refund without having to returning it. That, I was happy about. But now I am gun shy in buying again because the pictures and descriptions are not to be trusted."
5,A book filled with delight and discovery with each new page,"Jane Kirkpatrick has done it again! MYSTIC SWEET COMMUNION is my favorite book yet by this talented author. She weaves her stories with literary grace and emotional depth, and builds worlds filled with characters that live on in your heart long after the last page is read. I am in awe of Ivy Stranahan, her compassion, honor, and perseverance. What we can learn from this woman's life journey! I highly recommend this book."
5,A real life story of true devotion!,"This is a wonderful story of two amazing people--Ivy and Frank Stranahan. Ivy's dream to become a teacher turned into much more when she married Frank Stranahan. They became very important in the growth of Ft. Lauderdale and to the Seminole Indians who lived there. They were a unique couple with a very surprising relationship. As I read the book, I felt as though I knew Ivy and Frank and could visual the area. It is an inspiring book about two very real people. Jane has the ability to make you ""feel a part of"" what is happening in the book! Enjoy!"
2,Fact or Fiction?,"Very disappointing. The author has written a fictional, in-the-first-person, autobiography. Quite a contradiction. The extremely personal details of Ivy Stranahan's life should not have been included, as the reader has no idea where fact and fiction begin and end. One cannot imagine that Mrs. Stranahan would have wanted these details, if they are true, to be available to anyone who happens to pick up the book. Perhaps speculation of this sort would be more acceptable if the main character were one who had lived centuries ago rather than a 20th century individual. The bizarre details of her private life tend to distract from Mrs. Stranahan's accomplishments. This book can vaguely be categorized as historical fiction, and there are no illustrations."
1,Not very interesting,After reading the Kinship and Courage series I excpected this book to be just as good. I was very dissapointed. I did not like all the boring history. I also did not care for the characters very much.
2,This one just didn't quite engross me.,"The history of Florida was interesting but the book didn't make much sense to me. The plot never really was developed and the characters didn't seem real. A lot happened to the characters but without being able to feel what they felt, it was just a history lesson. I did finish the book but it was a struggle. It was such a disppointment after reading Love to Water My Soul."
4,A small flaw,"I met Jane Kirkpatrick and have tremendously enjoyed all her books....this was no exception. But you know how when something just doesn't fit, it sort of takes away from it? Well, when she describes the birth and the mom asks Ivy to help and Ivy freezes and the baby dies it was just not real. No mother who is conscious during and after the birth would wait for and rely on anyone to clear the baby's airway. No way...not real."
1,tough love in all its many sick forms,"If you're into S & M, brutish and unfeeling Viking women, then this book is for you . . . I didn't like this book. The sex scenes were brutal, humiliating, and not erotic. I'd give this book no stars but Amazon wouldn't let me. Icky porno book."
5,Rika Rules!,"This was an amazing book - I'm still finding it hard to believe that it's been hidden away under the genre of erotica and therefore been deprived of the praise it deserves. I first read a review of it in SFX magazine and was sceptical. I thought I'd try it anyway, though, and was I in for a shock: beneath the Viking storyline are several equally important themes - for example, I found in the novel an examination of the nature of violence and a scathing critique of religion. So the novel has those layers in addition to being one of the sexiest reads of the year and a sword-'n'-sorcery fable that puts Xena to shame. Viva Rika! I want more."
1,Bad Purchase,"I admit I made a mistake by buying a cologne without trying it first. But sincerely, the scent of this one really deserves de name Clean, but not for simulating a shower recently taken. It's rather like a recently cleaned restroom. It smells like cleaning products, floor soap or things like that. I strongly suggest you to try this previously. I'll never do this kind of nonsense again. Anyway, it's a good product to splash on the bathroom as a home fragrance."
4,Fine and clear treatment of electrodynamics,"RMC is a clear textbook about electrodynamics. You don't have to have much previos knowledge about the subject to follow the theory, but you should be familiar with the basics of vector analysis. There are quite many examples and the problems are reasonably difficult (answers are provided).As a whole this book covers the theory well and some of the applications too."
4,Great book for Mathematical proof of Physical Phenomena,The book clearly explains (mathematically) the existence of physical phenomena. Proof of experimental facts can be described through physical laws and proven by mathematics. One had to be mathematically proficient to verify the validity of the arguments presented. Vector algebra and calculus with some knowlege of differential equations will greatly help in keeping up with the material.
2,Be Careful,"Paul Althaus who was an outspoken supporter of Hitler and the Nazi party. In 1933 Althaus spoke of Hitler's rise as ""a gift and miracle of God."" An excellent book on this subject is ""Theologians Under Hitler."""
4,A movie well worth seeing.,The book is certainly better than the movie but the movie is a semi-faithful version and has its own qualities.
5,Greatly surprised,"This book surprised me greatly. I was familiar with the first edition of the book. When I bought the book I expected improvements in this second edition, but to my surprise the improvements were a lot more than I had expected. I highly recommend the book for any trainer or trainee."
1,Like Watching Paint Dry!,"While I do think that this book does offer some valuable information, I also think that a reader can only get so much information out of a book that is thoroughly unenjoyable to read. The book would be far more effective if reading it wasn't such a painful task. The material is very dry and many of the explanations within the text are very unclear. I found myself reading the same pages over and over again because the book just couldn't hold my attention . Overall, I do not recommend this book. It's far too dull to get much out of."
3,Mediocre book for a graduate class,"I am not at all impressed with this book. It's the required book for a graduate class I'm taking, Teaching a 2nd Language. I have never in my life seen so many quotes in a text book. I would say there are at least 5-6 on each page with at least one being so long, it can't be put into quotation marks, but rather has to be set off in small font with an indented margin. It also bothers me that in most of the quotes, information is omitted. It seems like a paraphrase would have been more practical. Also, like I mentioned, I'm using this book in a graduate class, but I feel like it goes entirely too deep into the background of the methodologies with very little emphasis put on explanation of the process of the methodologies. I'm sure there has to be a better book in print."
3,?,I actually bought it for someone else but all arrived in timely fashion and good condition. thank you
2,Just didn't engage my children after the first showing,"The first time we put this video in, our 4 month old Kaia watched it, but our 26 month old, Emmie just didn't care a bit for it. She took it out of the video machine after 15 minutes, and does the same thing everytime. I think it's because it is very slow compared to her new favorites, the Baby Know-It-All videos and Baby Animals videos. She will watch Baby Einstein if it is on, without the same ill reaction, so its not because of the straight classical music. I think there is just too much use of the computer animated graphics, and the lack of narration also makes for lack of interactivity."
1,Sketchy Cartoons and Sketchy Philosophy,"I like Buddhism and I like cartoons. However, the cartoons in this book are sketchy and most don't seem to have much of a point. The cartoons are not well drawn at all. I'm surprized they could get this published. I guess fools like me buy them hoping for something better."
3,An honest book by an author who has been there.,"First let me acknowledge I don't recall liking ""Red Badge of Courage"" that much. The heart of this book are the battlefield experiences of the protagonist, an infantryman in World War II. They ring true, and are informative. The main character is reasonably well drawn, and there are two minor characters of some interest. I did not find any aspect of the book emotionally gripping, and I found the author's writing a bit heavy handed and repetitious."
4,Famous Bible stories with pictures for kids to enjoy!,Each individual Bible story is short and easy to read. The colorful pictures keep their attention. Our children have grown to know the characters and have learned a great deal about them. This is a terrific tool for making children readers of the Word.
5,This is a great first bible for toddlers.,"The simplified stories are easy for a toddler to understand, and the illustrations keep their interst and attention. A great first bible."
3,It could have been a little better,"I bought this book for my 3 year old and although he liked it, I found myself re-wording some of the passages to make it easier for him to comprehend. It's not a book that he begs to read over and over, and although I'm glad I bought it, I would recommend it more for younger toddlers and infants."
4,Great Guitar Rock!,"Have seen these guys half a dozen times over the years and they have been great every time. Cross between Dokken and Motley Crue. If you get this CD, you WILL need to get the follow up - Hungry."
5,"good service, good time, good product","the product arrive on time, it work perfect. price very good. I will shop more from this company"
2,Too vague.,This book is entirely too vague. I would have liked a bit more factual information. There is a lot of fluff to sort through to get to the meat of the text!
3,Good condition,"THE BOOK WAS IN GOOD CONDITION. IT HAS A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION, SAME CONTENT THAT LAST EDITION."
1,bad shipping,"book was supposed to arrive at Sept 27, its Oct. 6, and i haven't got the book yet. Never gonna buy a book here again"
3,The Beginning of the Middle Section,"Not really a separate novel, this is the start of the middle section ofThe Night's Dawn Trilogy, which started withThe Reality Dysfunction Part I: Emergenceand will conclude withThe Naked God, Part 2: Faith. Again, a pretty good read, but it drags in spots. All in all, it was good enough to keep me reading.watziznaym@gmail.com"
2,Dickens Lives!,"I think Hamilton has some great ideas, but in trying to tell twenty stories he's lost the ability to tell even one properly. I found myself skipping whole paragraphs at the beginning of each chapter because I didn't care to get bogged down in the ecology of another fantasy star system or the details of another invented technology.If the ""big deal"" is the how and why of souls returning from the dead, then why are crucial details shunted into side conversations that have little other meaning? If that's not the big deal, what is? Joshua Calvert's next conquest? The wonder weapon to finally seal the breach opened to the Beyond by the Li-Cylph (remember them)?All the enthusiasm I had generated during reading Reality Dysfunctions has petered out, finally squelched when I found out the sequel to this book isn't the end of the saga. I think he had enough ideas for 2 or 3 books, not 5."
2,Could not get through it,"I am a huge fan of hard science fiction, but this book I put down a quarter of the way through and can't make myself pick it up again. If you like pain, gore, and unpleasant images, you may love it. I did not."
2,The series falls on its face with installment #3,"After having read the first two books in the series, I am sorely disappointed by this book.It would appear that Hamilton has run out of ideas and is instead resorting to the ""Star Trek"" trap of including elements of the present (Al Capone anyone?) into the future for the purposes writing a story.The characters carried over from the first two books are just as interesting. The ideas contained in this series are just as intriguing. Alas, this book contributes nothing new to the series, and actually brings down the overall quality of it.I read the book, I finished the book, and I am reading the sequels. However, most people will not find themselves able to read through the drek that this book constitutes. Perhaps skipping ahead to _The Naked God_ might be a better idea."
1,Violence too depressing,"I found the violence too depressing to continue reading the rest of the book. But I'm ordering some of his other books, hoping this isn't a thread in all of his fiction."
2,Peter Hamilton has Been Possessed,and he's trying to steal my soul by boring me to death!!I hardly ever flat out stop reading a book and give up. That's what I did with Neutronium Alchemist. Even more tedious than the first book - Reality Dysfunction. Just as goofy (dead coming back to possess the living?!?). Even more intricate subplots that disappear for what seems like hundreds of pages at a time. Just as much gratuitous sex and gore. And finally Hamilton pushes it over the top by bringing back Al Capone. Gimme a break.<...
5,Cyberpunk: The Next Generation,"This book is sooo hot. It's a rare mixture of slam bang action, high technology, ancient magic, and a really big philosophical question that's been dogging mankind since we crawled down from the trees. I don't know whether to wish for the series to conclude so I can see how it comes out or if I should just hope that Hamilton turns it into an encyclopedia so I can keep on reading forever!"
3,"great story, [bad] paperback quality...","I love this story, I am almost finished with this novel and am moving on to number two.However, this is my only gripe:The quality of the paperbacks a horrible. I made a HUGE effort to not so much as bend the spine on my book and the cover fell off half way through the book.If you buy these books, the cover WILL come off. It's as if they were manufactured with rubber cement.Don't expect a lot of resale value on these paperbacks."
1,Filter for Pondmaster pump,The filter doesn't last long. But then again neither does the Pondmaster PMK 190 pump that we bought the filters for. The Pump lasts about 4 to 6 weeks. We gave up after 3 of them.
3,"Fun, but only includes chord charts and lyrics","This is an enjoyable book for campfire or other gatherings. I was surprised, however, when it arrived. What is included is more of a set of lyrics pages, with chord charts above each line. There is no musical notation or tablature. I'm glad I have it, and my family enjoyed using it for a three-guitar and mandolin jam session and sing-along at a beach house. The book is fun, and I'm glad I bought it, but I wanted to provide a more detailed description of what you are looking at."
4,fun at a campout,"I would agree with the other reviewer that the book is mostly lyrics and chords, but I would still recommend this book. I had one copy for a couple of years and finally bought two more so the ""singers"" could share some copies and not have to look over my shoulder. the chords are simple and you get to do your own thing as far as strumming style is concerned, which is about perfect when you are sitting around a campfire. The book is a combination of old folk, classic rock and even a gospel song or two. Most of the songs would be familiar to most people (well, most adults anyway). I just starting to pack for a mini family reunion/camp out and several people have already reminded me to bring my guitar, this will be the book that I bring along."
3,A disappointment,"I'm very sorry for all the enthusiastic fans that have written other reviews, but I don't like this CD. I must admit that the only reason that I bought it was to have an original copy of ""Machine gun"", which in my opinion is the best funky instrumental song of all times. So, 6 stars for ""Machine gun"". Most of the rest is poor stuff, especially when Lionel Richie takes the lead... I don't like any of his ballads (except ""Easy"", perhaps). Two or three other songs (for instance ""Brick house"") are groovy, but none as good as ""Machine gun"". I guess there must be some really fun Commodores album out there, but not this one..."
5,Uncensored at last!,"For those of us with a sick sense of humor that is timely (refers to people and events in the news just recently) and funny and full of trash talk, this is it! This is the first set in the English dub new series of DVDs that is NOT censored. Thank you for that!"
4,"Part 1 was great, Part 2 not bad","After purchasing the first part and loving it. I found out that part 2 was going to be released soon. When it came out I bought it. It is funny, and obscene like the first, but I don't think it is as good as the first. I still recommend for a good laugh. The Super Pooper episode is so funny. Season 2 is to come out soon I think and I will probably buy that one too, because this little guy is so funny. I love it."
2,Gotta love the Editorial Review,Wow. Did someone actually write that? Makes me want to buy this DVD set. Not! Once again funimation turns Shin-chan into low brow comedy you would see on Family Guy or South Park. Maybe if they stuck to the original script it wouldn't be that bad.
4,Good solar marking lights,"These lights are not for illumination, just for marking the edges of a driveway or walkway. They look very well, in a Mission-like design. The solar cells work well and seemed to collect enough energy for lighting up at night, even after a cloudy day. I no longer worry about driving into a ditch while turning into my driveway at night."
2,wood with holes,"As a woodcarver I was looking forward to creating an interesting object in butternut. The block I received had so many holes (probably worms) that only a little more than half is useable. I examined the piece carefully and noted that the holes go quite deep. Even a ""practice"" block should be of better quality."
4,not a bad start,i bought these blocks to start to learn to carve wood. they are a good size and fairly easy to carve into. the shipping was fast and arrived before expected.
1,MY HUSBAND THE NEW WOOD CARVER,I GOT THE BLOCKS WHEN I ORDERED THE WOOD CARVING KIT FOR MY HUSBAND. THE KIT WAS GREAT BUT HE SAID THE BLOCKS ARE WORTHLESS. THE FINGER GUARDS WORK GREAT.
3,An informative bio of the world's oldest living aviatrix,"Bobbi Trout, is alive and well, and perhaps one of the most overlooked aviatrixes. Bobbie set several world records and comming up on January 2nd, 1999, is the 70th anneversary of her world endurance record for women; twelve hours and eleven minutes. Bobbi is also the only survivor of the original Powder Puff Derby.This book, full of Bobbi's magazine and newspapper clippings, tells the story of this gifted and healthy lady's life as a pioneer in aviation. A must for all aviation buffs.Stan McClain, Pasadena CA"
4,Great footage - no cheese,"This DVD and ""Out of The Blue"" are certainly the most satisfying documentaries on the UFO subject. Don't let the silly cover design fool you, this is quality content. The video footage alone is worth the price.Once you see these UFOs captured on tape, you don't need a narrator or eye-witness accounts to convince you something extraordinary is in the skies. I'm not convinced by the surgery portion of this doc. because the findings of that doctor were effectively challeged on a Sci-Fi network show, but as a skeptic, the videos will certainly open your eyes."
4,Very good Video of UFOS,"I really liked this video alot which provided for me alot of information and video. The video was well done and had alot of details. Interviews with Bob Lazaar, Roger Leir, Gordon Cooper, Linda Howe and more! Definetly a must for any UFO seeker. I was impressed. Good get it already!!!"
1,Close Encounters:Proof of Alien Contact,"I am a believer but this almost put me to sleep, there isn't anything overwhelming here,It could have been better,it had the potential."
5,Rudy Ray Moore - Greatest Hits,I enjoyed listening to the CD. It was of good quality. I have no issues with the sCD at all.
2,Sanyo 4700 Car charger,"Shipping was fast, customer service was good. The item received was the wrong item, it seems to be that they didn't have what i was looking for so they sent a different item in it's place. I sent it back for a return with no questions asked."
5,Songs of the century,"If a lively girl sings, we lose the world and when she becomes silent,we lose her.So ifeel better lose world rather than lopez"

4,Almost Perfect,"Wanted to be able to archive data and place it in a fire safe. For this purpose it works great. Couple of minor issues, the led indicator on the front only works with certain drives (or so I suspect from Promise's website. I don't get accurate led indications with my 2TB Western Digital GP drive. Also, have to manually activate the disk when the system recognizes it and have to shutdown the computer to remove it (doesn't show up like a removable disk). Not a big deal for weekly/bi-weekly archives."
4,Thats a good album,"i can say that i like this album but in no way that i love it. Its not another October rust or Blood kisses . Its just a typical nice album by type o negative. It takes some listening s to like this album, but it worth's the time."
1,Disappointing....They once used to be a very creative band,"and all that's left are some clueless, punk wanna be/california, banal songs that don't even get close to the old TON dark, melodic psychedelic melancholy.....ehh. Waist of time and money by all means; and by the way pictured Rasputin have with all this talent less banging and simple lyrics?"
3,another type o cd,"i have all there cds i dont know why i like them but i do.im so glad the drums are back in the mix,i thought life is killing the drums were buried.again i dont know what makes type o negative sound so addictive but it is and profits of doom is shure to please us confused mediocre type o fans."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this release. The reasons is because more than half the album is noisy feedback, and Peter Steele's songwriting shows how jaded he is with life, and the band. The lyrics are very juvenile and uncreative, and musically, just noisy feedback that lasts for 15 minutes a track.The only song I like off this album is 'These Three Things'. I really didn't even care for September Sun, reminds me of Adam Sandler's song that he sang to Drew Barrymore in the movie ""Wedding Singer"". This is the first TON album that I can honestly say that I do not like. I only like one song off the album, and even then its not what I call a radio friendly hit.Sorry Peter and Crew, but your not getting any younger, and the music isn't getting better. Quit while you are ahead so I can enjoy the great music that was once October Rust and Bloody Kisses. I guess this is what happens when you run out of ideas when you are pushing 50.The Dream really is dead."
1,I HEAR DEAD PEOPLE,"My god what have these guy's done. What a mixed mess. Josh Silver used to produce a band called pist-on and there cd was called NO 1. Well this should be called NO 2. Because it sure smells like it. Better yet there last cd should have been called DEAD and this one DEAD AGAIN. ILL bet Roadrunner Records are glad to get rid of these guy's. They take a 10 minute song and make it sound like 20 minutes, Its like the energizer bunny it goes on an on and on and on. They have one song that sounded pretty good but than they have to ruin it with a stupid Russian chant. It's an old saying if it ain't broken don't fix it. You guy's better go back listen to some of your old cd's and WAKE UP, WAKE UP. Call you next cd Awake Again."
2,What happened to my favorite band from Brooklyn??,I have to say I was far from impressed with the most recent outing of the Boys from Brooklyn's talents. Ok I know not every CD can be as good as October Rust and I wouldn't want a repeat performance but geez! Out of the entire CD there were only 2 tracks that were even remotely close to the kind of music that I love and expect from one of my favorite rock bands (and even those were so unmemoroable that I can't recall them at the moment) How disappointing! I'm sorry to say I expected much much more from these guys than the generic thrash metal bang clang roar that I heard here. I think I'll go play some of their REAL music and sob in my corner now.
4,More like 4.5 but close enough,"The mixed reviews here are very interesting. People either love it or hate it. I've had this CD for over a week and I love it. With the exception to ""Ode to Locksmiths"" this is an album you can listen to from begining to end. It's like everything good about previous albums rolled into one. I think what upsets some people is that it is less ""gothy"" sounding, less romantic than previous albums. This to me is just a reflection of the rough few years the band has been through. I can't imagine any longtime fans being disapointed with this one. Trust me, this one will grow on you like fungus!"
5,wow! over an hour of musicianship,"Type O Negative definitely sped up their music a notch. their early work, up to October Rust, was slow and heavy, but they have gotten heavier over time. to me, it sounds like they mixed a little Danzig into their music. somewhere, it was said that they were influenced by Sisters of Mercy and Bauhaus. evidently, they are also influenced by Black Sabbath and Danzig as well, the 1st and second songs are faster than previous works, and Peter Steele's baritone voice is replaced by the band's melodic singing. on song no. 3, Peter adapts a hardcore voice at first, and then his signature baritone voice is on and off. he must have been reading the Bible, because the song is about the Apocalypse. one minor complaint is that the lyrics are hard to read, but they make up for it with excellent musicianship. this album is hour and 17 minutes long and the third song alone is 10 minutes long. this is an interesting listen."
2,Plain and Simple,"I don't want to say I hate this album but, I won't say I like it either. For as long as it took for this to come out, I figured something may be worth looking at. In my opinion it's kind of boring. Most of the start of the album sounds the same. Without going overboard and writing a ridiculous long review. It's okay for the completist to add to the collection but, nothing really stands out. It's just Type O."
2,Disappointing. Sadly.,"I waited for a very long time for Type O to come out with a new release and like many others, I was sadly disappointed with Dead Again. It is uninspired and BORING. There isn't much else to say except I wish it was more 'goth' because no other band I know could ever do the vampire goth music like Type O. This is just boring music."
1,What happened?,"Let me start by saying i am a huge Type O fan, have been since the early 90's. This is album is by no way the Type O negative I know and love. It sounds like a weak attempt to sound more like Carnivore, which it does not. (Carnivore albums are much better than this. Will i say I hate the album? No, i think September Sun is a great track, the best track on the album. I can honestly say it is my least favorite Type o album."
2,Not woth the wait,I'll be the odd one out in this review but here it goes. October Rust was the best album ever. I've been waiting for this album like most hardcore fans for sometime expecting the creativety and musical magic of TON but this album is basically disappointing. I always believed that Peter Steele wrote the lyrics of TON while taking a dump and unfotunately this one stinks bad.Is it worth buying ? I'd say most are buying because the wait has been so long. If your a big fan like me BUY IT and hopefuly yo'll enjoy it more than I did.
4,A Strong Return for Type O Negative,"Okay, my guess is that there are two types of people who are approaching this cd: One, who is the hardcore fan of Type O, owning most (if not all) of their cds. The other type would be the person who's heard very little to nothing of Type O Negative, and is interested in listening to more. In either case, I would suggest ""Dead Again"" because not only is it an interesting cd with a focused hard rock sound , but it's both pleasing to a hardcore fan and the casual listener. My only other recommendation would be for the casual fan to check out ""Bloody Kisses"" or ""Life is Killing Me"" first, because they have Type O's most popular songs and are the most accessable (respectively). But if you are curious what Type O really sound like, ""Dead Again"" defines their style accurately and has awesome songs."
2,Worst Type O album,"I found this album quite boring for Type O Negative. It lacked the dark humor and heavy-metal musicality that the other albums have. Sorry Type O Negative, but don't buy this album, I couldn't even listen to the whole thing once. Spend your money on my fav, October Rust."
5,Dead but not forgotten,Seller sent purchased item in reasonable time and was in perfect condition.Will not think twice when ordering from them again.
4,Catholic???,"This is my second favorite Type O record, with ""Slow, Deep and Hard"" being the first. With that said, this album is what everyone has been waiting for since ""October Rust"" came out and ruined all the hardness that was left of the band. ""World Coming Down"" was heavy but slow and not very intense. This album grabs you and throws you to the ground. My only complaint is some of the lyrical content, there are lots of Apocalyptic and Catholic tones, and it's from the guy who wrote ""Jesus Hitler"" no less... still a 4/5."
1,A departure from anything GOOD,"As a loyal fan of Type O going back to Bloody Kisses, it pains me to say that in my opinion the band has lost their way with Dead Again. It feels derivative, lazy and uninteresting. I gave it three listens, trying to find something in it appealing, and aside from September Sun, came up short.Took it out of the changer, put in their previous work, and I was much happier."
3,Disappointed,"Got this CD a couple of weeks ago. I was really disappointed with the depth of the music. After listening to ""World Coming Down"" which was the ultimate to me in doom/death metal it was hard to get into this cd. Aside from a couple of tracks it was way too easy sounding plus I started to hear other tones to the music that put me off. Maybe I should have listened to a few other Negative O cds before I got this one but the cut throat sound of Negative O is not on this cd."
2,Good Photos...But Nothing more ...,"This is not the book you are looking for i think.. It offers more when you buy it but gives nearly nothing.A weak content, very simple ideas. May be some of the how to's may be usefull if you look in an optimistic way.Indeed, in my opinion, what you get is not what you expect..."
4,Gospel of Mary of Magdala,"This book is interesting and easy to read. It provides a fresh look at women as disciples, and a different slant on 'sin'. The author discusses the teachings of Jesus in the context of the teachings of Plato and the Stoics. Understanding the philosophical context of Jesus' times provides insight into what he taught, and what Mary of Magdala had to say about his teachings. It's worth reading."
5,Best of Mary Magdelene,"Having studied many very well done works on Mary Magdelene by top rated experts in the field I rate this as the most comprehensive, well documented,easy to read and understand, and far reaching text in regard to scholarly referencing and early church history available.King's book on the Gospel of Mary is an easier read and the most fascinating and best documented historical text on Mary Magdalene as the 1st Lady of Christianity,wife of Jesus, and designated primary Apostle meant to lead the teachings of the early church on the passing of Yeshua.The tragedy of the loss of the original female role in early Christian priesthood/teaching is made clear in an academically rational manner. An inspired work that flows easily, smoothly, and clearly for the reader."
3,Not what I expected,"The author is a feminist. I didn't think it would make a difference. It does. She translated the phrase that is normally translated as ""Son of Man"" as ""child of true humanity"", because it is gender neutral. Similarly, ""kingdom"" became ""realm"". With what amounts to a chapter's worth of gospel, she then extrapolates enough information to fill the remaining 160 pages, plus 35 pages of notes and references. I am not a gnostic scholar, and most of the material is lost on me. Considering her assumption of Mary Magdala's intentions, along with her modifications of standard translation, I stopped reading.I don't have an infinite amount of time or energy when it comes to reading, and I decided to put it on the back burner. Someday, maybe I'll get back to it. This is neither a recommendation nor a true critique. Just my two cents."
3,"Good book. Minimal content of the actual gospel, though.","Most of the book is interpretation and elaboration... the gospel translation is a small portion of it, contained in the first couple of chapters."
5,Interesting writing,The author is very articulate and gifted in bringing some good enlightment to a forgotten Gospel and the true diversity of Christianity in the first and second century.
4,Thot Provolking,"Although only fragments of the entire Gospel of Mary have been found, the author uses these to give the reader an in depth picture of the thinking and ""real life"" pictue of philosophies in the early Christian era. A number of citations are made from other writings of the early Church, which are not part of our current Bible. Very thought provolking. Challanges the reader to step outside their ""comfort zone"" of religious understanding."
3,"Interesting, but....","I haven't finished reading it yet, but my immediate impression just in the first few chapters is the author has a strong feminist leaning with some barely veiled hostility at times. I prefer more objectivity."
3,"A question, please?","Admired this book. Enjoyed it. But why does the author assume Mary is from Magdala? This bothers me. If in all her obvious research, she's found proof of Mary having anything at all to do with the little town of Magdala I'd like to know what that is. Magdala might not even have been the name of the town at the time. Magdala comes from a root word meaning tower. The name Magdalene, with its obvious reference to a tower, could have come from any number of sources. The one that springs to my mind is Magdal-eder, She of the Temple Tower...which would connect rather well to a sect around at the time led by a Mariamne, called ""priest."" To decide Mary was born in a small Galilean fishing village called Magdala is, well, to be blunt, sloppy scholarship. Not that it might not be true, but that it's so much accepted as true by Ms. King, she uses it in her title, thus making it appear true. This makes all the rest of her work somewhat suspect to me. So I had to settle for three stars."
2,A rehash of old data,"This book brings together supposedly historical documents supporting the idea that Mary Magdlene was wife of Jesus, and also the thirteenth apostle. It contains original documents of sects in old Egypt after Christ which prove there was definitely a cult of worshippers who took her as a holy woman and one with Jesus Christ in bringing God to the people."
3,Not written for EVERYONE,"Author has written this work for a specific audience, mainly the highly educated, i.e., PhD or higher. Jesus spoke so all could understand, which cannot be said for this work. I happen to have the ""appropriate"" education to comprehend this valuable and informative work. Sad to think of all the individuals that will miss out on this most important work."
4,Gospel of Mary of Magdala,The book gave me new light on how we are to think of ourselves as spiritual beings..within our human limitations.
4,thanks.,Satisfactory. Same appreciation as above. Many of the CD's and books that I have ordered easily have been received quickly and in good condition would not have been obtainable elsewhere.
2,not as good...,I have listened to this CD and find Chynna Phillip's songs nothing short of boring and redone. Her CD sounds exactly like the 80s girl bands that came and went. Her singing is nothing special nor noteworthy. Sorry Chynna maybe next century...
1,Alarm; what alarm?,"When I hear the word ""alarm"" I think of something that will grab attention. This device's alarm is so weak you couldn't hear it in your shirt pocket. My cell phone beeps louder than this unit. Don't waste your money!"
5,The New Settlement Cookbook: First Classic Collection of American Ethnic Recipes,"This arrived sooner than promised. The book was in good condition as promised. The paper cover was a bit worn at the top though, which is to be expected in this used book. Some of the recipies that were in the previous edition were not there though. It is a great value for 1 cent."
2,beautiful but temp not acurate,I wish I had seen the previous reviewer before I bought this! It is 5 degrees lower than the actual temp. It is beautiful but a thermometer is to be acurate.
3,Guzzi workshop manual,Still this is useful as a basic manual for basic service and basic knowledge on the older Guzzis. I am preparing for spring and summer tours.
2,bo-ring,"The ideas are trite, the prose is pre-sophomoric, and the little introductions by the author that precede each story are nauseatingly self-centered. One of them (preceding ""Shadow of the Mothaship"") says: ""The way I write stories is really stupid [...]"". Hear, hear! I can't imagine why Bruce Sterling endorsed this puerile effluvium."
4,"Great but for a bit of a ""bugout""","After reading one of Doctorow's short stories in another collection, I was intrigued enough to follow up with an entire collection of his and was not disappointed. The stories - for the most part - are all very engaging, funny and draw the reader in, even when the ideas, concepts and sometime technologies that Doctorow has created are a shade on the complex side.I will say that I was less enamored of the ""bugout"" stories (of which there are three) mostly because of how little of the world is documented, making it very difficult to understand some of the motivations of the characters described.All in all a very good collection."
3,its okay,i didnt have an aha moment or anything while reading this book. theres a lot of sensitive topics on sexual crimes that are at the root of shame which is disturbing. and talk about the innerchild is strange to me as a full grown adult.
2,"Good attempt, missed target.","I was given this book by my therapist. Immediately upon reading the book, I found it to be old-fashioned and sexist. For example, on page 4 Bradshaw says, ""What a child needs is a firm but understanding caretaker, who needs to be getting her own needs met through her spouse."" Further on in the book he talks about how a mother is supposed to bake pies, a daughter is supposed to do the dishes, the son is supposed to save the family from a fire, and the father is supposed to take the family on vacation.Even disregarding the sexist comments, the book offers very little new information. For the most part, Bradshaw is pulling from other authors such as Alice Miller, who has obviously written about these subjects in a much more logical and efficient manner. Bradshaw is redundant, often commits circular reasoning, and does not appeal to the gifted individual he speaks about so often."
3,Nope,"I dont know, others have said this is a good book, but I cant get into it. It makes sense, somewhat, maybe I am just not ready for it."
4,Flawed but worthy,"This was one of the first Popular psychology books I ever read.It made a big impression on me.It's easy to read and I promise you'll get a lot out of it.Put it on your ""must read"" list."
1,Cant make sense of this one,"Sorry..I know this author is suppose to be groundbreaking and fabulous, but this reads more like someones master degree thesis...It only offers case histories, no real direction for healing."
1,This book is really bad.,"This book shamelessly regurgitates the ideas of others without documenting the sources with footnotes. Moreover, Bradshaw fundamentally misunderstands and misrepresents seminal ideas drawn from psychoanalytic theory, Gestalt therapy, Transactional analysis, and other schools of thought. The result is confusing and will lead many people down a false path in their attempts to address mental health problems."
3,Shame is shame,"When the author describes the damage of shame he is right on. However, he describes shame as a normal healthy emotion. It is not. He describes 'toxic shame' as the unhealthy emotion. Shame, straight from Webster's: 1a. A painful feeling brought about by a strong sense of guilt, embarrassment, unworthiness, or disgrace. b. Capacity for such a feeling 2. One that brings dishonor, disgrace, or condemnation. There isn't anything normal or healthy in that definition. Yet, the author creates the illusion of a 'healthy shame.' As long as the reader stays true to shame as 'not healthy' and disregards any imaginary reference of 'healthy shame,' 'Healing the Shame That Binds You' has insightful views in the realm of shame."
1,nauseating psycho-babble,"i couldn't even get 25 pages into this book...it is so full of ""techno-speak"" littered with terms from counseling and psychoanalysis which are bewildering and unintelligiblethe whole premise of ""healthy shame"" is like saying ""good murder""-it makes no sense..."
5,A fine addition to the Die Hard Soundtracks,"The composer, who never scored any prior Die Hard movies, has done a terrific job of capturing the sound of the earlier film soundtracks while adding his own new material to it. This album is a fine addition to the Die Hard albums the preceded it and if you liked the music of Die Hard, Die Harder and Die Hard with a Vengence, this new album will not only satisfy you, in many ways it has more of the exciting parts that score the action and does well in the sneaking around music that also typifies these films. In a year when other films that were series from the past such as Harry Potter V and Superman Returns were disappointing, this album really delivers for the listener."
2,Die Soft,"I felt the music was very disappointing in this one. It was dry and boring. The composer utterly failed to capture the pace and excitement that has become a trademark of the Die Hard series soundtrack. His music is atmospheric to the point where you can hear crickets chirping practically. A Die Hard film's score has to be fast and loud. The only times anything resembling quality music occurs is when the composer reuses themes from the previous films, but even then he fails to capture their original intensity."
4,The one that all will know...,"Ok, let's face it, you're buying this disc for one of two reasons: a)you like NIN and this is a must own for your collection (and it IS) or b) you, along with those other people who like the song Closer, are just buying it because you don't want to get into NIN, but just want this one song, along with a few remixes, on a disc. Either way, the fan will be satisified.Closer to God, the opening track, is a remix of Closer. Not only is it a great track (my favorite of the cd) but it surpasses the original version. This one has a great, and catchy, drum beat, synth-lines, and guitar riff. Not only that, but some of the lyrics are different as well.The other standout track on this single is Memorbilla, a great dance track.Besides that, I won't be saying much else, because after the first listen, those tracks which I spoke of became my favorites on the single. Yet all in all, you will NOT be disappointed. But on we move...Further Down The Spiral..."
2,palm trees,Looks nice...but poorly manufactured. One of the trees was damaged when it arrived. The final section of leaves doesn't fit because the stem on which the leaves are anchored isn't long enough.
4,Good alternative to scratch made Palm Tree,"I just received a couple sets of these Palm trees by Pegasus hobbies. I ordered the ""A"" and the ""B"" types since they are pretty inexpensive and really didn't know without seeing exactly what I liked better. Anyway, on to the review. These trees are made pretty durable with a flexible plastic....not the harder plastic that you typically find in scale plastic models. The downside of that is the detail isn't as crisp. For scale modelers that might be looking for these trees in a diorama....they would work just fine but will need some touching up. A good paint job followed by a wash and simulated weathering with paints will really make these trees look pretty good. I plan to use them in a diorama with a 1/32 scale aircraft as the main subject."
5,standard training leash,not much to say if you've ever used these before. very lightweight fabric that wont hold up for anything but training but works wonderfully for that.
5,Amazing!,"This book opens up the world of the Old Testement, showing how God in his infinite wisdom has paved the way for Christ ever since creation. Baylis sheds much light on the prophecies that came true in Christ, and the beautiful love story that God has written for us. A wonderful tool for any wishing to study and explore the Old Testement."
2,disappointed,"I'm sorry to say I was really disappointed in this book. After just reading it a little while, I got really irritated by the absolute approach to the Bible. For the sake of clarity; I regard Genesis 1 & 2 as a story of how God created the world, but not as historically factual.Because the book seems thorough, I nevertheless give it two stars."
1,A clear treatment of God's dealings in human history,"I just finished my first reading of this book. It presented a wonderfully clear summary of God's progressive dealings with mankind throughout the Old Testament. I envision referring to this book frequently in my research and teaching, and wholeheartedly recommend it to any student of God's Word."
3,Spicy sputtering,"Important especially in its creative early free-jazz context, these rambling often atonal jams do come packed with enough fused Miles-esque integrity to keep things engaging enough, but lacks the melodic propulsion that separates tastefully lasting experiment from tried and true classic. Spicy sputtering"
4,Engineering a Future,"London based quartet The Engineers are a very talented band, proof is found no further than their debut effort Folly. Coming in the shape of a six track ep, it is a wonderful and at times mesmerizing array of indie beauty arriving from the same camp as My Bloody Valentine, Air and Doves.Swirling harmonies and sweeping contrasts provide the basis of the sound, whilst the majestic vocal talent of Simon Phipps creates imaginative scope thats on a different playing field to any other band at the moment.Engineers are forging their own highly original, deeply intense, utterly original sonic masterpiece. Odds on to be magnificent next year, the talent is certainly there but are the mainstream ready to open their minds to the groundbreaking sound of this band. Lets hope so."
5,a great academic study on lewis and clark,"Okay, so the Lewis and Clark bicentennial era has come and gone, but this remains a very good study of a sensitive subject - lewis and clark's encounters with Native Americans. Not given to empassioned conjecture or political polemic, Rhonda considers context, comparable expeditions, and lots of careful, well-documented research in telling the story of and drawing thoughtful conclusions about the expedition's recorded perceptions of the inhabitants they encountered and their responsibility for subsequent treatment of Native Americans in the West. The late historian cum history-book-factory Stephen Ambrose deemed this book worthy enough to fill an entire (albeit footnoted)chapter of his popular work Undaunted Courage almost exclusively from Rhonda's text."
4,Quaker Breakfast bars,The Quaker breakfast bars are pretty good for breakfast bars. They are pretty small though.
2,Intermatic LZ3 Malibu Solar Powered Light,"Initially this product had great potential because we live on 5 acres in southern California and the lights were planned to highlight the drive and other areas of foot traffic without running cable. We purchased a dozen lights and they performed as expected for a while although the light intensity is very low and not sufficient for foot trafic safety. BUT, after about 10 months of use only 5 are still operational. Apparently the electronics for charging the batteries failed as new batteries were inserted to verify this. We will now lay cable for non-solar lights."
2,Not very bright,I ordered these because I needed the amber light to match the low voltage lights I had in another part of the yard. They came pretty close to matching the other ones but are definitely what I would call bright. They are rather dim as is typical for solar lights but since I needed just two they seemed to fit the bill.
1,Total waste of money,This light is a total waste of your money. The ad is misleading and it states lights which is plural meaning more than one. So I thought I was buying a pair. The light is cheap plastic and I am very dissapointed with Amazon for even offering it.
5,Great Book!,"What can I say about this book?!?! I am 15 years old and started my path in Wicca a year ago and believe me this book helped alot. I would recommend this to ALL beginners, but yet it is still for the seasoned Witch! All I have to say is that Michele Morgan is now one of my favorite writers ever! Buy this book! ~:o)"
3,Title Says It All,The title of this book says it all. A good book for beginner beginners. A great reference book for advanced learners.
3,Good Basic Book,"Good information for those interested in Wicca, but not the top of the line. The author is a Washington State psychic and spiritual counselor. She mentions she is a double Sagittarius, something I find interesting for some reason. She also says she does not like to do research, which I find a bit odd in a double Sagittarius.Never the less, this is an excellent book for beginners and those who might wish to practice as solitary witches, as it has an introduction to ritual and some useful spells in it. I would have no hesitation in recommending it as a good starter book to those interested in Wicca or other nature religions.Recommended, especially to the novice witch."
5,Excellent Wicca 101...,"I found this book at my local library and pickedit up to see if it was much different from other""Wicca 101"" books. I was pleaseantly surprised tofind some new ""flavors"" for an over-worked subject.Yes, this book is very basic and still follows the maintenets of Wicca, but the author adds her own ""spices"" whichreally helps to freshen up the subject. But most of all,the writing and concepts are extremely straight forward and understandable.A perfect combo for any newbie!This book is a very enjoyable read.....I would reccomend it to anyone who is interestedin Wicca whether as a practitioner or just curious.If you ARE a beginner, this book, coupled with SilverRavenWolf's ""To Ride a Silver Broomstick"", would bean excellent choice to get you started in your studies.Now that I've finished this book and have to returnit to the library, I'm going to go out and buy myown copy. It will make a wonderful addition to myWicca reference collection.Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!Ravenwinds"
3,For people with kids over 9,"I had great expectations for this book. I respect Dr Cooper and his work. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the book. There are 115 pages of nutriton related information mostly suggested menus and recipes - there are lots of good nutrition books for kids. The fitness evaluations were mostly for kids 10 and older. He recommends an active lifestyle and sports, but that's not worth the money to me. I'd say check this book out at the library for the fitness test information but keep your money in your pocket on this one."
5,Absolutely The Best Yet!,"I've been a Clay Walker fan from day one and I had been anticipating the release of his seventh album, Say No More. I was not disappointed with the final product. I have every one of his albums and he just keeps getting better. Every song on Say No More is excellent. His vocal range is spectacular. He has fun songs like La Bamba and soulful songs like You Deliver Me. This is one cd that is a must have."
1,inaccurate readings!,"Bought one based on previous reviews. This machine will not accurately read blood pressure (some of the numbers that i got would suggest that I could not possibly be conscious, let alone sitting here typing a review!) Successive readings would yield totally different numbers, and you would expect the numbers to be in close range of one another. Sent it back for an exchange -- same thing on the second machine. Returned the second one as well. Save your time and look elsewhere!"
1,Worst product I've ever had,"This is one of the worst product I've ever known. I bought it as a birthday gift for my 70-year-old mother. She was very happy with it, since she wanted one for a while. She opened the box and tried right away. She got 150/110. Then I tried. I used to be a semi-profession soccer player. My heart rate is around 50, and blood pressure is around 90/60. But this machine gave me 128/92. Even worse, 3 days later, my mom told me she'd got 185/150, and similar results 3 times in a roll. That really pissed me off, since I didn't mean to spending my hard earned money on garbage like that, especially on my mom's birthday gift. At that time, I still didn't think the product was badly designed. So, I bought an exactly same model from Target. If this one works well, I'll return the other one to Amazon. To my suprise, the new one acts just like the previous one. What can I say, HoMedics?"
1,BPA-200 Revies,"I've had the BPA-200 for about a year. Last week I checked my blood pressure and the BPA-200 read 190/128. I tried again and got various readings, all high. I changed the batteries, and there was no improvement. I went to urgent care. They said my blood pressure was 110/77. What a relief.I've tried the unit several times this week and the readings were scattered, but all were high. Previously I had a Panasonic manual unit. It never malfunctioned. I threw the BPA-200 away and ordered a new unit of another brand."
2,"Operation is easy, but....","I don't get consistent or accurate readings. Have checked with supplier to make sure I understand instructions and have followed written instructions to the letter, BUT....I have double checked it 7-8 times at 2 doctor's offices and twice with the local firestation/emt, and in all cases this unit has consistently been 15-20 points higher than the others. The doctors/emt recommend that I get one with an upper arm cuff because they have a larger measuring area than the typically small wrist types. We shall see. I may have gotten a defective unit, but Amazon was great with my return."
4,ANIMALS AND GREAT MUSIC,"THIS VIDEO IS A GREAT CHANGE FROM THE USUAL""TODDLER LOVES"". IT FEATURES KIDS, ANIMALS,MUSIC, AND A FEW CARTOON CHARACTERS THATPOP UP ONCE IN A WHILE. NO TALKING JUSTMUSIC. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR CHILDRENWHO LOVE TV, BUT PARENTS WHO DON'T."
4,Good for what it does,"I purchased this logger in July of 2006. I have not had any problems with it since. The external sensor went in 2010 and i have replaced that since. I wanted to get a cheap temperature station that recorded data and that i could save on the computer and look up past history when needed. The program that comes with it is pretty cheezy. It saves the temperature & humidity data in a line item fashion & then you could export it into excel to make graphs. I did not find this too user friendly. Luckily, i was able to find an outside weather program (WSWIN32)that imports this data and saves it in a way that is very user friendly."
1,Stay away from La-crosse products at all costs.,"I purchased this product 1 year ago. I liked the pc interface, internal logger, and small design. After a week and 1 year the sensor failed. Exactly 1 week after that the console goes postal. With indoor temperature and humidity readings of 99. To reset it you need to remove the batteries for their is no reset button. Screen comes back on and again with the 99 degrees and %. The software is worthless. It'self. You only view the data, but you need excel to create things like charts and graphs. With faulty data (99) this whole station is worthless. customer service is non existant. Everyone avoid La-crosse products. Try Oregon Scientific instead. I have their bar609hga for 3 years and still works today."
4,Does the Job,"CHF-11S is pretty much the only power-steering fluid you can use in Mini Coopers (apparently), but it does the job. My power steering has stopped whining when I turn, so I'm satisfied."
4,Seems good - way too large,This seemed to be the only game in town for my 2004 mercedes power steering. It is a shame it isn't offered in a tiny top-off quantity.
2,Had the look but lacked in details,"I ordered this holster bag expecting it to be the same quality as my Botkier trigger bag. It lacked some major details. It should have had a magnetic closure on the two main outside compartments. The side pockets also should have had a better closure. The flaps would not stay closed! The blue color is beautiful and the look of it is nice. It's just not worth the money, so I returned it."
2,Okay overview but too much fluff,"I don't need to be guided through browser selection, Netscape v. IIS, or a re-hashing of the OSI model. The core of this book, IMHO, is found in chapters 9-13. If you're willing to spend the money for a 400 page reference with 100 pages of solid material, then it's worth buying."
1,Disappointing,The pieces don't hold together good and the window hatch doesn't even connect to the rest of the model. My 9 year old son was extremely disappointed in the quality.
3,"Fast, easy, but threads aren't as strong.","The threads on this are a bit slimmer than when you do a manual tap. Although for fast applications this is fine, for high strength, or constant wear, this may not be what you're looking for.The included countersink, and drill help to speed up use significantly, but for some applications I'll stick to my trusty manual tap and die set.Although for steel, thick materials, or low usage items this will do just fine.Not recommended (imo) under heavy use for: wood, aluminum, or plastics."
4,Captain Jack and the Dalton Gang,"This book is very well written, The story quickly moves from page to page about a period in our nation's history before automobiles. Trains were the major mode of transportation, Our great-grandparents lived a daily life of danger and threats of crime much like today. The western prairie was a very dangerous place!Hanging Judge Parker was quite an interesting person to read about.This book should be read by any person interested in our history."
5,Leon at his best,"This album has some of the best music Leon Russell has ever done, and that says a lot. It has some of my all-time favorite love songs."
4,Back to the Island,"This is a very good CD, but not a typical of Leon Russell. It has a flavor of blues to it with a southern drawl. I recommend it..it is easy listening and it seems to be from the heart."
5,Leon Russell CD,I was so happy to recieve this CD so fast and I am still listening to it..Very happy with my purchase...Lisa
5,This is Leon Russell's defining masterwork.,"Although, Leon Russell's work covers the gamut of musical genre, this it the one album of his that really touches my soul. I've owned this album in every format possible. From vinyl, 8-track, cassette, to CD and it never fails to bring a warm feeling to my heart, even on the most cloudy, dismal days. While, Leon hit it big with his classic ""Lady Blue"" and ""Bluebird,"" to me, these are just two of the man's truly moving masterpieces in the collection of jewels that populate this album. Do yourself a favor and take a trip ""Back to the Island"" to spend some time in a ""Little Hideaway"" just ""Laying Right Here In Heaven."" I promise it will ""Make You Feel Good"" even on your worst day."
5,Better than ever,This is a good remake of Leon's album. Very good quality. Good price. Fast delivery.
5,Jimmy JAMS!,"They weren't around very long, but the Communards recorded some amazing music in the 1980s. There are 14 tracks on this CD, and you'll enjoy most, if not all, of them. If you love your New Wave, then this is a must have for your collection!"
5,Great Compilation with some long-lost B sides,Track Listing1. You Are My World2. Czardas3. So Cold The Night4. Tomorrow5. Annie6. Hold On Tight7. If I Could Tell You8. There's More To Love (Than Boy Meets Girl)9. Zing Went The Strings Of My Heart10. I Do It All For Love11. Sanctified12. Judgement Day13. Heavens Above14. Victims
3,socks,"I am not particularly happy with these socks. They are a bit tight in the ankle and have more elastic in the top than I like. They work OK in summer with close fitting shoes, and I do use them, but I am always happy to take them off when I get home. I have worn gold toe crew type socks for many years and like them, but these don't suit me so well. For people with thinner ankles and calves they might be just fine, they are relatively dressy."
3,Dynamic Kick Lives up to its title !,"Its a well-detailed photo instructions that are still quite good. Some of the techniques presented by the author are difficult for beginners to execute. Nonetheless, its worth having it in your collection."
1,not what you probably think,"I picked this up for a penny (plus shipping). It's a small 4x6inch thick book of quotes from assorted books that caught the author's fancy. They are sailing related. Even so, I found it rather dull and thought that whole stories would be told, which is not the case. The quotes range from one to four sentences, and each page has a different quote, arranged by topic. Not recommended by me. I would like to add, that Chris Caswell is my favorite columnist from Sailing Magazine!"
5,A must read,This is an excellent & easy reading book for those new to prayer or those just wanting some guidance. Men & women will benefit from these methods. It has enhanced my private prayer time as well as family & group prayer time.I highly recommend this book to all God's children.
4,for prayer group,Well written and easy to read book. Enjoyed using in our church women's bible study and fellowship. Words Words Words
1,Defect,The book was torn in many places and has many missing pages. It was impossible to make use of the book. I will have to say that it was deceptive to sell such a book.
2,Very hard to read,"This book is widely used in finance courses in my university, a puzzling fact because books should rarely sell if they're hard to read. The bookfs authors introduce a broad array of investment theories and discoveries. Thatfs a plus. But their wordy sentences, which grow wordier and harder to follow as they delve into each chapterfs key concepts, offset the plus. The authorsf inconsistent use of terminology is another drawback. As I move on to later chapters, I feel as if the authors were growing more verbose. That benefits no readers, given the later chapters discussing higher-level concepts.When they revise this book for the next edition, they should hire proofreaders, journalists if possible. They care about readers and can help rewrite the entire book into a readable piece that helps students instead of confusing them."
1,Grueling Read,"The authors make even the interesting areas of finance unimaginably dull with long, confusing sentences and few real world examples. I also think the textbook is setting students up for failure by presenting formulas without enough discussion of the assumptions going into those formulas. All in all, it's a text by academics for academics.Also, one of the authors is said to have ""spent two years at Fredie Mac, where he helped to develop MORTGAGE PRICING and CREDIT RISK MODELS.""Ummmm?"
1,Needs work.,"I found the frequent inconsistency of terminology disconcerting. There are concept checks, while helpful are necessry because the authors have trouble explaining key concepts. Not intending to be spiteful, the authors could gain a lot from reading Strunk and Whites book. The author has the need to write clearly and directly. Insufficient explanation of key concepts."
3,Great for starters. Interesting news captions.,This book is great for blooming finance professionals and MBA students. Not too advanced and is aimed at simplifying thoughts and Wall Street practice for the average man. News captions are interesting but not exactly superb.
5,Great Condition!,I got the book in perfect condition and it even SMELLS new! Now I just need to get the one that came BEFORE it!
5,I can't get enough of these Marvel Zombies!,"Better than expected. A must have. The book came in a nice protective package with a backboard. The book itself was amazing. I've learned to trust anything that Kirkman has written. About to order ""Dead Days"" soon."
4,Entertaining on both a visual and reading level,"A lot has already been said about this through all of the other reviews, so I will not waste your time in reading the same things over again. Suffice it to say that this is a wonderful little gem that is very entertaining. If your into Marvel and into Zombies, well, your in for a treat. Don't expect a real in depth story, they went for a primarily guts and gore fest with some wonderful wit and 'commentary'. Your favorite heroes keep their personalities and traits that make them endearing when they were, well, alive. Otherwise this is a fun read that you can read multiple times.The real pleasure here is the art work. If gore turns you off, then steer clear, but there is no denying that it is good. Granted, comic book artists are all good in their own way, but some just have a skill that really gives the graphic piece that 'POP' that it needs. Sean Phillips and Arthur Suydam did their job well."
2,"Fun read, horrible end to the story","I loved book 1 and Dead Days, even Army of Darkness crossover. This book though, disappointed so much because of the ending. There was no real solution to the problem and the wrong people were left ""alive."" I feel cheated a dirty and I hope Marvel has some more side story projects, especially the one about what happens to Ultimate universe Dr. Doom. They left his story wide open."
3,"Good Start, But.....","I had to write a review on this....I felt that the first MZ book was hysterically funny, and should have been left with just those stories. Dead Days was actually very good as well, with the Army Of Darkness spin-off rounding off an already tired storyline.This story should have been much more solid, but I can only deduce that Mr. Suydam's artwork is what kept this series going....because Mr. Kirkman seemed to have run out of ideas. I gave this three stars because although the beginning is interesting, the end is atrocious; horribly cliched dialogue and an overall feeling of disappointment. I recommend all the volumes for collectors, but really, this series needs to end with this; even if there is a possibility of dragging out another story, enough is enough."
1,TERRIBLE STORY,"Even a five-year old could write a better story than this one.It was a big disappointment, specially because the write is the creator of `The Walking Dead`. I really thought he could do better than this.And the art is also horrible. There is no background in a lot of frames, giving the impression of a rushed work.I really do not recommend this to anyone older than 8."
4,That ending TRULY suucked....,"Man... If that was the ending, then that TRULY, TRULY, sucked... The series is only 7 books long? WHAT?! That is messed up. I was interested in the series and it was rreeeeaaaaally good, but if book 7 was the last book, then I'm TRULY disappointed.... Well, otherwise the series is very good, but I don't get it.... exactly WHAT IS the relationship between Raenef and Eclipse?!! They are both GUYS aren't they... So why did someone say that they should have kissed??? Well, another thing, what about Raenef's engagement??? @_@ I hope this series continues......"
2,"Pretty, but empty.","The art is delightful, the comedy is okay, but the boys-love is far too light. It's absolutely a tease. Not even one kiss! I wouldn't even reccomend this as a first boys-love to someone new to the genre; they'll want something harder before they finish the series."
2,Solar - don't beleive the claims,"Hello:I purchased 20 of the solar lights. I am located in California and have a very good share of sunshine. Dispite that, the best I get if 5-6 hours of light before each is dead or goes off. Therefore, in the winter, these lights are going to be very poor. The cheaper amber color lights have 2 AA cells, these only have one.Ever tried getting technical support, no email or toll free number!My advice, go elsewhere.Kevin"
1,Junk - application tubes split open,"This product is junk. When I tried to apply the solution on my cat per directions, the tube split along the seams on the side and I got the solution all over my hand instead. I checked to make sure the nozzle was clear and it was fine. I tried with a second tube, this time making sure the nozzle was clear before I tried applying the solution on my cat. Same result - the tube split along the seam. I'm getting a refund for this overpriced junk."
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT,This product is terrible! Made my cat very sick. Don't try the cheap way out with this. Definetly pay a little more money for a more trusted product from your vet. It doesnt work and there are hundreds of reviews on this product all over the internet so many pets have been made ill from it!
1,Worthless,"The product is certainly more affordable but absolutely does not work. My 4 cats had no adverse reaction however- neither did the fleas. They're still very much alive and biting. The higher priced products work, work quickly and work reliably. If you genuinely can't afford them I'd recommend using a flea comb every day, washing all bedding and vacuuming regularly to help control the fleas. (Putting a flea collar in your vacuum cleaner's dust bag helps too.)"
1,Sergeant's sliver sequeeze-on for cats and kittens,"I rate this product as being very very poor, as it does not work. My cat's fleas are worst and have treated several times with this application as well as give them a bath. It does not work and is a waste of money."
1,Beware,Beware of this product. It is not worth buying. The product had a very very strong odor like a pesticide. It was very runny while applying on my cat. She did not like it and ran away after only about half the product was added. Hours later little did I know but I notice a red spot on my cats skin where the product was applied. I will not be using this product again on any animal. It is not worth a dime paying for.
1,My cat is loosing his hair,"After applying this to my cat I have noticed that the flea problem has not gone away or decreased and my cat is loosing his hair when he had a perfectly fine coat before using this product. I will not recommend this product. Be careful if you use it, I wish I had spent the money on the name brand. Never again."
5,Love this book,"have purchased this book years ago for myself as well as for others. This purchase is the second one for my mother, as she has worn out her old copy. This is a very good book."
2,"Looks great, but broke very easily!","I love the way this strap looks, but unfortunately it broke after just a few days. Not really strong enough to be an affective Camera Strap!"
1,Revolutionary Martyr Story,"In the People's Republic, tales of Japanese atrocities in WWII are still popular. This is a little different because it's about German atrocities in WWII. The story reminded me of a medieval story of a Christian martyr. The Germans do leer in this movie; the victims are pure in heart, and true revolutionary comrades. All in all, a boring propaganda movie.It's in color, and in focus. Very little of the dialogue is in Chinese. Most of the actors speak German or Russian."
2,The Description is Incorrect,"I ordered this DVD in Spanish because they stopped releasing the normal DVD's right in the middle of the series. Instead of completing the set and releasing the rest of the season, FUNimation started to release the ""widescreen"" version of the show in the orange boxes. The Saiyan Prince was the last disc released in the Ultimate Uncut series and can only be found in Spanish. Amazon's description said it comes with English subtitles, which I would have been fine with. However, the English subtitles do not exist on this disc. It is Spanish audio and text. Nothing else."
3,A Cops First Hand Account,"The author gives many anecdotes of his life as a police officer in Wichita,Kansas. There is also a section of general law enforcement information with tips for the reader on how to interact if he or she has encounters with the police as well as tips on driver safety,personal safety and home security."
4,"Great text, recommend",Shipping fast and packing appropriate. Text is good reference work for understanding the titled subjects without unnecessary use of jargon. All jargon and key terms are defined well in the text. Charts and diagrams are helpful to the text and style is direct statement of information presented. Recommend for learning and understanding subject.
3,decent book,"If you're a mechanical or chemical engineer and you want to start learning the petroleum industry, this book is a good starting place. it's not a ""dummies guide to..."" but it simplifies the topics enough for folks with little to no back ground. I am transitioning from aerospace to petroleum and this has been a really great way to teach myself how to keep up in meetings with all the lingo and technical concepts."
3,shocking,"this book had me readin with my mouth hangin open...there is nothin erotic about this book it's completely nasty and even perverse, but i keep readin to see what would happen to this 14yr old sex crazed child....well to say the least the story line took a turn straight to weird. i finished this book and didn't know what the [heck] it was about!"
3,One Wild Book!!,"This was one wild book! It was just mind blowing the different things going on with a fourteen year old girl. I'm not sure what it truly was about...Maybe about Annette finding herself?!?! The book kept my attention but it was really not my kind of book. However, I kept reading just to see what would happen. Overall I gave it three stars."
3,"Not bad, but not good","Off Keck Road chronicles Bea Maxwell, daughter of a well-to-do family in Green Bay,Wisconsinand her journey apart from the expectations of her times. Bea is never openly rebellious, in fact she is passive, floating from one reaction to another. As her life unfolds (almost without any direction from Bea, she simply reacts to what life doles out) she collects a group of the cast offs of the town, people who reside on and near Keck Road. I was really put off the passive tone of the book, found it hard to follow. The characters are well-drawn, but not people you really are drawn to. The wonderful writing is weakened by the fact that you can't muster up too much concern or interest in thse people. A real let down, especially following the previous books by Mona Simpson."
3,I'm weighing in against the tide,"I wanted to like this book much more than I actually did. I loved ANYWHERE BUT HERE and looked forward to another Simpson experience, but I felt oddly 'left out' of this story.Bea Maxwell started out sympathetic but, in the end, she became so tightly wound and fussy that I just couldn't continue to like her.I actually liked Bea's mother and her best friend much better than Bea. They had lives...they laughed a lot and neither were afraid to live.I can't recommend this book. Wish I could, but I just can't.Maybe next time."
2,Disappointingly Shallow,"The ideal reader of this novella would be someone who grew up in a unexceptional suburb of Green Bay, Wisconsin, so count me out. I kept waiting for something to really happen, and it never did. I remember a professor saying once, ""No one can write fiction that's like real life because it would be too boring."" Here's an example. One thing happens after another and it adds up to zilch."
1,Amazon Fraud,"Hey, talk about fraud! The product picture shows a case of tape and lists the normal price as $236 (which is what you's expect for a case of this tape.) It's advertised as 94% off (or $14.96). Makes sense, right? So what do you get when you order it? One roll of tape that supposedly ""normally"" costs 236 dollars? I called and complained about this rip-off a month ago, but it's still here. Buyer beware! Amazon does have fraudulent advertising!"
1,false advertising!,The exact same thing that happened to the first reviewer happened to me. Should've read it before purchase. you would think amazon would want to keep their reputation clean. Do not ever order from these people. You will be very disappointed!
3,Savannah Sheet Sets,"The sheets are very cute, but the material is thin and scratchy. I would recommend you buy a good quality solid sheet to go along with the Comforter."
4,Good product for the money,"I bought the BlueAnt T8 in 2007 after reading reviews on quality, price, battery life, talk time, etc. I got it for about $20 at the time. The battery life and talk time are FANTASTIC. I use and abuse this little bluetooth on a daily basis and it works beautifully. The biggest negative I've had is that the earpiece only is one size and it's really bigger than my ear. If I had bigger ears, even like my Dad's (sorry Dad!), it would be a perfect fit. I have found it needs to be cleaned off periodically on the earbud to keep the sound quality. But, despite these minor drawbacks, it's been excellent with pairing with my Motorola Razr V3 (about 5 years old now), takes the abuse, is very lightweight, charges quickly and maintains the charge. If they could modify the earpiece for those with smaller ears, I'd buy it again!"
1,"Good design, awful sound quality","Good design, but people I called said that I sounded as if I was speaking through a tin can covered with socks... Too bad, very disappointing. Don't bother."
1,Very poor audio,"Bought this handset about a year ago. Wanted something different from the usual BT headsets and paid a premium for it. But totally disappointed...the audio is terrible...there's too much static and you have to speak at the top of your voice to get heard on the other side...that is if you get lucky. The customer service from the company is good though, they've patiently replaced 2 units so far for when i contacted them with the audio problem (I would have preferred that they acknowledge the problem with the product and replaced it with their best seller),"
5,An amazing story!,"In July we took the Alaskan Inland Passage cruise and myhusband became interested in the Chilkoot Pass history.As soon as we got home I went to Amazon, found this book,got it for his birthday and he has thoroughly enjoyed it.He only wished he'd read the book before we took our cruise."
2,Cobra NavOne GPS,"I bought this GPS about 2 years ago and it has worked fine. I have taken it with me on many trips including AL, TN, CA and around FL. It has always found my destination. I have recently bought a new GPS to replace this one. Here is why. This unit is now about 5 years old in technology. At the time it first came out it was state of the art. But not anymore. It is big and heavy. It does not have a touch screen, but it was not hard to program in a destination. The map is always displayed with north facing up and the cursor will go in the direction you are heading so if going south then the cursor is heading down. Newer GPS's change the orientation of the map so you are always heading straight ahead.I got a very good price on this unit when I bought it but GPS's with more features are less expensive now. I would not recommend buying this unit, buy a new one and you will be more satisfied."
3,Surfaris Drummer Ron Wilson's Great Vocals,"This compilation highlights Ron Wilson's vocal talents along with earlier instrumentals by The Surfaris. The new vocals feature post-British Invasion hits the likes of Dylan, Turtles, Grassroots, Everlys and others in strong versions of the originals. Ron Wilson's voice is strong, rock-valid and pleasing to both the casual and serious listener alike. This is a great gathering of The Surfaris last works."
3,Odd Compilation but has some Gems,"This is an odd compilation of albums but it is interesting in that it has some things that you won't find anywhere else. While it's true that the Surfaris were at their best when doing their trademark instrumentals, they did some great vocal stuff too(usually with Ron Wilson or Jim Fuller on lead)while working with Gary Usher. It also has some very different sounding stuff(although not my favorite) from their last album, which is unavailable. It kind of falls into the folksy/hippie/protest rock that was so popular from around 66 or 67. They had clearly lost their way by then and were trying to stay commercially viable, and I think only Ron Wilson and Bob Berryhill were still in the band. Everyone had left in protest and were replaced with studio musicians by their record label. But this CD does fill in a few blanks, I'm glad I have it but I would prefer to play their earlier albums instead."
1,It doesn't work anymore,"I've used this for about 4 weeks now, and it started out great, but no longer registers properly. I know this because I walk 2 miles on my treadmill every morning, and the pedometer is now erratic and incorrect. I've replaced the battery and it started working okay for a couple of days, and now its back to erratica."
5,Nice cable,"This is not some cheap thin cable that so many others sell. If all their products are of the same quality, they have a new customer for life."
4,Should have bought a Roku box,Bought this to connect the computer to old TV to watch Netflix. Then I heard about Roku that will connect Netflix to any TV without a computer.
3,What happend to Bono`s voice?,"I consider ""POP"" a good U2 work. Far from TJT and Achtung Baby albuns, but in the same level of Zooropa, what means it's worth buying. When this video reached the market, my expectations were high, specially because this band used to perform musically better on stage than in studio ( to back this statement up I quote "" under a blood red sky"") or as well ("" Rattle and Hum"" ). Now the band is more worried about "" acting"" and musical part itself is being forgotten, specially one of the most important instruments in the irish band: Bono`s vocals. I don't regret this video aquisition, but I have no doubts that the old Bono performer is much much superior than the one that came up on ZooTV and is present in this show."
4,POP is not a LEMON,"The POP tour was the 2nd time I'd seen U2 live with ZOO TV being the first. It is great to have a good quality record of the over the top event that it was. As with any U2 show, the magic is in the music and this particular show does not really get off the ground until about the third song, but after that it flies. This band has no equal when it comes to a live performance. The extras are great as with all the recent DVD releases."
3,A big disappointment,"First thing I noticed was the terrible sound quality on the VHS version. Then as the concert droned on, I began to feel the lack of intimacy and emotional connection between Bono and the audience. Since the camera had to pan wide to catch the enormity of the light show behind the band, the band often appears tiny, overwhelmed by the silly spectacle going on behind it, which is unfocused and loses its power by being pointless most of the time. I much prefer the later videos of the Elevation tour when they toned it down enough so you could actually focus on the band. There are some great moments though, especially Edge's solo version of Sunday Bloody Sunday. Maybe it was better for those who were there, but the video leaves me cold."
3,Lots of showmanship and sensory stimuli.,"I love U2's music, always have, and likely always will. Bono's thoughtful lyrics and vocal intensity is matched only by Edge's virtuoso guitar, Adam Clayton's absolutely essential bass, and Larry Mullen Jr's unparalleled drums! They are the four tightest players in rock I can think of.And they get restless, like any good artists do. So they expand, and change and try new things. The Popmart tour was evidence of this. Heavy on spectacle, with enough flashing lights and images to send an epileptic into seizures; someone must have advised them that bigger is better. It isn't. The best parts of this performance are the quiet times. Edge's lovely vocal solo of Sunday, Bloody Sunday, for instance, makes you wonder why he isn't featured more that way. Popmart is a good concert video, after all, it's U2. It just reminds me why I don't attend live rock concerts."
5,LOVE FOR U2,THIS CONCERT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE GREATEST PRODUCTIONS EVER...A MUST FOR EVERY U2 FAN AND FOR ANY FAN OF REAL MUSIC!!
3,Fun to watch as a period piece.,"If you collect U2 concert DVDs, this one is worth seeing especially if you weren't paying attention to them during their POP period. It's a hoot to see them attempt this huge undertaking. And of course, if you like the POP album this DVD is a must because after this tour the band rarely plays any tracks from that album. If you are just a casual fan and are looking to buy only one U2 concert DVD then skip this one and buy the Slane Castle DVD which best captures the live U2 experience."
2,PQ is horrendous....Videophiles beware!!!,"I have been looking forward to this coming out for months and they release this FULL SCREEN?!?!? And to make matters worse, it looks like the concert was done using sony handycams or something. This is pathetic. I am very disappointed."
1,Popmart Sucks,"If you want to see why the Popmart CD and concert got a bad wrap from U2 fans, buy this DVD.I saw the Popmart concert in 1997 in Miami. The concert was lame then and it is lame on DVD. It is not the video quality, but the material itself. Popmart was really a diversion for U2. The concert is disjointed and the music isn't U2's best.In the Popmart DVD Bono reminds me of one of those mediocre Techno Miami superficial artists. Alot of superficial lights and video, but not much substance with respect to the music. The excessive showmanship overshadows the band and the music.I am so glad U2 decided to return to their Alternative Rock roots with the ""Elevation"" and ""Virtigo"" Tours. Otherwise I would no longer be a dedicated fan."
5,I was in this concert,"I was in this concert, I was only 20 years old and I remember that in many radio segments saids that U2 didn't going to play that day because they had a sereius problem one day before with the son of the president of Mexico, but they didn't cancel the concert and played one of the best concert on they history.This DVD really doesn't have price"
5,I was there... and this DVD has much more!!!,"I was there in December 1997, and I was just 12 feet from the scenario, and I remembered it was the best show I have been, and now with this DVD I confirm it.The DVD got it all... even things that I didn't see from the arena... the video and its edition is excellent and the audio is great in DTS format.I have the Elevation Tour DVD too, which is great, but this POP Tour is much much passionate... the video and audio edition, lights, stage, cameras points of view, the band, the big screen behind the scenario and its images and videos, get you into the concert....If you like U2, you have to get it!!!!"
4,A Beautiful Lemon (YUM!),"The huge screen behind them with the racing comic book imagery gives me a headache after watching more than two songs, but an extraordinary tour from an extradinary band. You know you're a great rock band when what you considered your worst failures are still spectacularly awesome and loved by millions! Rock on, boys!"
5,A must have for any U2 fan!,"U2's POPMART LIVE FROM MEXICO CITY is way better than ZOO tv, U2 gives the best on this home vid, the show starts with pop musik, and then mofo, they play their best songs. the only video i can recall that is as good as this one is Pink Floyd's P.U.L.S.E."
4,Jessi is being laughed at Liz is being admired.,"I LOVED IT!Jessica thought that a new school would be a chance to meet new guys and be the most popular girl at school.Elizabeth thought that the new school would stink mostly because she wasn't going to be on the school paper.Jessica,instead of the most popular girl she was the laughfing stalk of the whole school.Elizabeth met 2 new friends and 2 cute boys have acrush on her! Everything is weird!"
4,Good!,"It's a nice change from Sweet Valley Twins. Although it's kinda unrealistic how somehow only the twins get transferred to another school, it still makes you want to read the next book."
3,NICE BOOK!,"Well,to me,i'll say this book is cool.It's a bit unrealistic though.There were so few Sweet Valley Middle Schoolers and plenty of the rest.It's a bit sad for Jessica when everything turns out BAD for her and good for Liz.They'll be separated from their long time best friends for a real long time. Sweet Valley Middle School will never be the same. There's no more Unicorn Clubs and no more Sixers or the 7&8 Gazzette.Well,i say that if you read this book, i think you'll only like it."
4,Almost Perfect,"Although the world of Sweet Valley is often like a soap opera, this book is a little bit too unbelievable. I mean, what are the chances of ONLY Liz and Jess getting shipped to the new school, and NOT EVEN ONE of their other friends getting rezoned? Other than that, It's a great book, very funny. I'd definetely recommend it."
3,Re-zoning was a bit of a bad idea...,"I'm not sure I like the idea of Jess and Liz being shipped off to this Sweet Valley Junior High at the beginning of their eighth grade year. I like the first person accounts and some of the new characters are intriguing, but I would have had the original characters finish eighth grade at Sweet Valley Middle School, then if Francine wanted a slew of new characters, she would have done better to wait until ninth grade. Ninth grade is usually an interesting year and it would have been better to start a new series like Sweet Valley Freshmen or something like that and brought in the new characters then."
1,Disappointing new series,"Yes I am surprised it is so popular.Sweet Valley Twins was fab,and so was Sweet Valley High,and now both are finished for boring,boring series that I never buy.Jr high and espesially SR high are a major disapointment,and I would suggest reading Sweet Valley Twins instead of this yawnsome rot."
4,Great,"I love this series! It is so interesting, because the story is told from each character's point of view. Each character has their own personality, which makes the story very entertaining and fun to read. This book, inparticular, is mostly about Jessica and Elizabeth, and their transfering to Sweet Valley Junior High, having no friends and almsot no idea what lies ahead. Definately a good introduction book. I enjoy the books where everyone knows everyone, and has already made friends and enemies, but you might need to read this book to understand the others better."
4,Better Than The Unicorn Club,"None of Elizabeth and Jessica's friends got rezoned, but it doesn't matter. The story makes up for it. It's better than the previous series, but not exactly what I expected. I had expected it to be a little deeper since they're older now. I keep reading them."
4,A great book!!!!,"I really liked this book because Jessica & Elizabeth really seemed to have grown up. It might have been a little more realistic if at least one of their friends went to Sweet Valley Jr. High with them. But overall, it's a really great book."
5,"The best, but the coming-up books are even better!","I ordered this book from a book club, and since then, I've been a faithful reader. This book is really different from Sweet Valley Twins. The story just ends, and you don't know whats going to happen, plus things don't always end happily ever after. I think it's so cool how Jess and Liz are so shy. Jess can't show her feelings for Damon, and Liz likes a guy who isn't quiet and studious, in fact he's just the opposite! You'll really enjoy this book, if you have my kind of taste!"
5,My trumpet playing child finds this very helpful,"We learned about this product from our trumpet teacher. Since I've never used it, I'm not sure why some find it better than other lip balm, but it was the only way my child was going to use balm faithfully. I'm giving it a 5 because it does work well and my child actually uses it. We bought a second one for his stocking."
5,chop chops,The product is not greasy and the taste and fragrance is fruity and aromatic. I really like this product and after practicing on my trumpet chop saver soothes my chops
4,Good Product,This product is cheaper to buy on the internet than in a local music store. This stuff really did make me able to play longer than usual.
2,"Best Lip Balm I've Ever Used, Worst Seller","I am a trombone player in college and have been using this for a few months, buying it from the local music store. I love it, as it helps my lips feel better after playing for a while, and it doesn't have any harmful ingredients. I decided to buy several online to save some money in the long run. When I received them, all three were dried up and uncomfortable to use. For the product, 5 stars. For the seller, 0 stars. Next time I'll just buy it in a store."
3,Great Product if you don't mind the taste of Castor Oil.,"I tried Chopsaver based on reliable testimony. I normally use Blistex DCT or Carmex. At first it seemed really great. Nice smooth feel. Not greasy like DCT and not the medicinal taste of Carmex. After a few days the taste of its main ingredient, Castor oil, started to come through. It is now intolerable and prompts feelings of reverse peristalsis. If you don't mind the taste, I think it is a really good product and recommend it."
1,Careful!,"I used this product and had a bad allergic reaction. Even though the all natural aspect of this product sounds great, I can't recommend this product to anyone."
5,My son loves this series,"My 10 year-old son is a Star Wars fanatic and found this series at the school library. Unfortunately, they had only a couple...just enough to get him really into it! So we purchased the ones the library was missing. There are 18 in all and they were a pretty quick read for him. They take place before The Phantom Menace and feature Qui-gon Jinn and Obi Wan. My son definitely recommends these and I recommend them for young adults."
4,Outstanding Conclusion to Great Story,"The Dangerous Rescue brings to an end the story begun in The Deadly Hunter and continued in The Evil Experiment. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan must track down an evil scientist and confront a deadly bounty hunter in an adventure guaranteed to satisfy even the most demanding of readers. The Dangerous Rescue also features the return of Adi Gallia (one of the council members seen in Episode I) and her abrasive Padawan, Siri. There's drama, suspense, intrigue - in short, everything one could hope for except a bit of romance (but, after all, as the ads for Episode II told us, a Jedi may not know love . . . .)."
5,Great,"Love this show. Glad I bought the DVD's for my anime collection. Everything was shipped very fast, will do business again."
1,One piece Season 1,I never received this product. But I was charged for this product. Would like a refund. Thank you
1,NOT WORTH READING!,"Oh my goodness, what can I say. This is not even fit for TBN junkies. This is the worst presentation of preterism I have ever read. Just note the lack of indexed information in it. Had these guys really read even the few books that they listed. It is as though these guys are hinding the fact that they have really only read Chilton or ""Last Days Madness."" This is not the work of men learned in this field of study. These are guys just trying to sell a book to their church members and families. One gets the feeling that they are just wanting to write anything to make a few dollars. A current and better book from a preterist view is R.C. Sproul's book."
2,Don't buy this one!,"This trike is not well made and there is a better alternative for less money! I bought this one, realized that you can't steer it at all with the push bar, it's actually even difficult just to go straight . I returned it and purchased the radio flyer deluxe steer and stroll trike instead and we are much happier as you can steer the front wheel with the push bar and it seems to be made better!"
1,Inaccurate,"After extensive internet research and consultation with a pharmacist, I purchased this blood pressure monitor. It seemed to have the least bad reviews on Amazon. Even though I had been warned that wrist monitors are not as accurate as arm cuffs, I liked the features and packaging of this one. I have always had borderline high BP, and made an appointment with my doctor. I wanted to bring a record of my BP over 2-3 days before my appointment. Most, if not all of the measurements taken by this unit were at least 15-20 points higher than the ones taken by my doctor and his nurse at his office the ""old fashioned way"" (arm cuff and stethescope). Back it went to Walgreens in exchange for an Omron 780, which measured my BP very close to the numbers obtained at my doctors office. Although I liked the size, features and convenience of the Homedics BPW-200, I cannot in good conscience recommend it."
5,great product,great way to monitor your blood pressure at home.checked the accuracy between home and the doctor's office and it was very accurate.would most certainly recommend it.
1,do not bother!,"This cuff did not live up to the hype. It consistently measured my pressure incorrectly after I followed all directions. When I discussed this with my doctor, he informed me that these cuffs are precarious at best!I am back to the good old arm cuff. Do not waste your money on this one."
4,Good book only for experienced sewers,"The sewing diagrams and instructions are good only for experienced sewers. I recommend the author to look at ""Burda"" German magazine and see how to draw clear and understandable diagrams and instructions."
3,"One Broken, One Working","I bought two of these chairs for my dorm room. Within my first week at school, one of the chairs broke and was unusable. Though the other still works, I am very upset that my chair broke. It did not break at a joint like you may believe, but right down the middle of a connecting piece. Be careful using this chair."
4,the chair,"i got this chair on sale, i love it except when i got it up to college the first or second day it broke on me, i'm still able to use it, i just have to be careful when i sit down. But it is so comfy."
4,comfy but broke,"i love this chair, and i bought it on sale which was a bonus but....like everyone else it seems, it broke. the joint broke but i can still sit in it comfortablly but i'm very sad it wasn't more durable."
1,"Teach decision making, not guilt!","In a world where teens are exposed to a lot of sexual information and sexual stimulation, it does not help to attempt to control their behavior by preaching morality and attempting to instill guilt and shame. Early sex-negative indoctrination is not easily reversed and can impact later adult sexual relationships.Books for teens should focus on responsible decision making, realistic appraisal of consequences, and endorsement of freedom to be naturally curious. Sexual feelings are not immoral, sexual thoughts are not sinful, and all informed sexual options should be carefully considered."
2,No Sex and the Teenager,"In these modern times, books that promote abstinence are irrelevant to teenagers. Teens who are developing relationships need advice to keep them safe from the inevitable consequences of intimacy, not religion based abstinence. If the point of this book is to steer teenagers into early marriage before developing maturity and the skills to promote lasting relationships, the divorce rate, single parent rate and STD rate will continue to be unacceptably high."
1,What did they do to deserve this?,"What have the youth of America do to deserve this weak, uninformed, factless, baseless attack on their self image and sexuality. I am completely against the idea of book-burning, but the entrie print run on this one should be reserved for use as ballast when sand is running low for filling sandbags."
1,JUST A BAD BOOK,"This book is so lightweight it could float. Read UNCLE MAX by this author and found it fresh, funny and innovative. Well Mr. Kenry has certainly made a downward spiral with this so called novel after such great promise.The book has absolutely no in-depth characterizations, the story is totally unreal . The book is just very amateurish. There is some excellent gay fiction out there by some very talented writers. This book is not one of them. I honestly couldn't finish it. One of the worst I've ever read.Just trying to help some of you not waste your time."
5,Fondly Remembered,"Over the span of my life I have read more books than I can remember and most of them are forgotten, but this one stuck with me. I read it over 3 years ago and can still remember the pull it had on me. I can remember being captivated by this man's journey and by the way NY changed around him. I remember re-reading sections to be sure I got the full gist of the story and finding it difficult to put down at night. I remember the satisfaction and world of thoughts that it caused me to experience.This book put simply is an experience... It is not just another book you read before turning out the light, but one you will remember for years to come. I highly recommend it - though don't expect to zip through it in an evening..."
1,A Rare Book I Threw Out,"I went into this book looking forward to something great from Pete Hamill. Uunfortunately I was severly disappointed. The main character is someone you grow to be indifferent about and the story is predictable, too long and boring. Mr. Hamill is obsessed with certain topics and that is clearly apparent. Don't waste your time on this one."
3,"It was okay, but possibly not worth the time needed.","I felt that the story had a great build in the first half of the book, but after the initial section of his life (the point up until Cormac attains eternal life), the story falls short. The author skips time in big sections and doesn't match the time devoted to the beginning to the other sections of time. The historical aspect and views of America in the past in current vernacular makes it a good historical novel, but the magical parts are hard to believe and you are left wondering about characters that played major parts in the protagonists life. The ending is greatly disappointing for its lack of direction, but even with all of its faults, it is quite readable and the setting is interesting enough to keep the reader reading."
2,Could have been a good book,....but he got carried away with wanting to list all the people who have ever been connected with New York...which was quite boring. I started out liking it and the Irish history but about half way through questioned whether or not I'd finish it. The story line was lost so many times in the name dropping. I skipped over the last 10 chapters and am still not finished. I give up!
3,Walking through literary sludge,"Dear Readers, Reading this book is like driving behind a person who uses their brakes sporadically and never keeps a consistant speed! Sometimes, Hamill's prose caused my imagination to take flight, only to be shot down into the quicksand of Hamill's seemingly liberal, stereotypical takes on the evil, greedy wealthy and the can-do-no-wrong minorities and poor white trash. I'm a poor white boy and don't need to be reminded of how miserable it can be. I just wanted Pete to entertain me and allow me to put myself in the center of one of man's prime fantasies; immortality! Cormac never seemed happy to have everlasting life either! There are grand moments in the book, but like sex that starts with vigor and ends in impotent embarrassment, the climax left me feeling cheated out of moments I could've spent having sex rather then reading! The ending was so ""hollywood."" Peace, Trevor"
2,Not worth the time,"I bought the book very excited about 'visiting' New York through the past centuries. Hamill does not include enough description to create the places in the story for the reader. I felt like I was just in the tiny world surrounding Cormac. And after 600 pages, I have not come to care about Cormac O'Connor or what happens to him. Hamill does not effectively communicate any real feeling from him, though his experiences should be incredibly emotional and intense. The plot is predictable and disappointing."
5,NYC Historical Fiction - at its best.,This is a great piece of historical fiction - especially if you're interested in the history and evolution of New York City. On top of that the story line is great. Totally worth the read - you'll be recommending this book.
2,My reaction? Meh.,"The premise of this book was the reason I bought it. Given immortality, a man experiences pretty much the entirety of the history of NYC. I must have missed the part where he witnessed history. New York played a big part in this country's past, but it has been reduced to a couple of the sentences in the lengthy and tedious love life of a man who barely rates as a character in the book. The character is told that in order to be immortal, he has to actually LIVE. He didn't do that, in my estimation. Other than an association with Boss Tweed and an eyewitness account of 9/11, he seems to have missed every single historical event that took place in New York. Immortality was definitely wasted on this guy."
1,Pay attention to the review distribution,"Do you people see that the reviews are NOT top-heavy with the positives? There is a reason for that. I can't remember reading a more ridiculous example of pc nonsense, with the author imposing our modern sensibilities on a character some 300 years back. There is no character development, no change, no learning, NO relationship dynamics. Awful. Don't waste your money. If I could give this book negative stars, I would do so infinitely."
1,Don't bother,I read the author's Snow in August and liked it very much although I had to suspend belief. But this one goes over the edge and I couldn't make sense of it all. Read about the first half and then decided it wasn't worth my time. No more Pete Hamill books.
2,"It takes ""Forever ""to read.","Interesting from a historical point of view, but tedious to wade through.The concept of multi-generational revenge doesn't make sense."
3,A little disappointed,"Since I loved Hamill's 'Snow in August' my expectations were high. However, 'Forever' didn't hold my interest. I had problems wallowing into the novel's fantasy element despite my efforts to suspend disbelief. The characters were easily forgotten once I put the book down. I usually read a novel within a few days, but I had to slap myself to stay awake just to read this one in a month. It pains me to say this, being a fan of Mr. Hamill's previous novels, but I didn't care for this one too much.Chrissy K. McVay'Souls of the North Wind'"
4,A fascinating journey through the history of New York,I absolutely loved this book! Cormac O'Connor comes from Ireland in the 18th century to seek vengeance on a man that has tormented his family. He finds himself in a young and raw New York teeming with immigrants and energy. Through some heroic deeds he is granted the power of immortality but the only thing is he cannot leave Manhattan. New York in its infancy was nothing like the metropolis it is today. It's a fascinating story of the birth pains of a city.Pete Hamill does an outstanding job of describing New York at various points in history and I was fascinated by a story about New York I had never heard of. The fact that he meets historical characters and in affect changes history makes the story that much more fun to read. A little long and the ending's a little anticlimactic but a must read for any historical novel lover.
2,Unfulfilled expectations,"Being familiar with this author's work, I immediately bought this book. I was hoping for an extraordinary piece of fiction set against the rich historical background on NYC. But I was severely disappointed. While I enjoyed the upfront part of the book and the story of the character's life in Ireland and the ongoing religious struggle, this kind of depth did not continue when the book shifted to New York. Furthermore, I found it distasteful that 9-11 was used as a device to bring on the book's denouement. Not only was it insensitive, in my opinion, but the set up was so transparent that one could see it coming a mile away."
1,This was a waste.......,"Pete Hamill is a good writer, I read him all the time in the Daily News and enjoy seeing him expound on the history of NYC on the NY PBS specials, etc - I even liked seeing him in ""King of New York"". However, this book, and the idea for the story, though it was amazing, was a blown opportunity. Making Cormac a figure that rubbed elbows with George Washington, Boss Tweed, etc., was too much, and the 'suspense' leading up to September 11 was a bit ridiculous. His writing seemed like he had to ensure 550+ pages to his publisher, at times. The story from Ireland to NY was great, but he really got carrid away and made too much of well known history (Draft Riots, Tammany, and others) and not enough of daily life. I felt like I was 300 years old by the time I finished the disappointing ending, and, as a New Yorker and someone that works downtown Manhattan, almost insulted by the ending. Nevertheless, I still like Pete, I just wouldn't recommed this book."
4,Lots of New York history.,I liked this book. It contained so much history about New York in earlier centuries. I really enjoy Pete Hammil's books.
4,Great read,"I read this over a trip to NYC, and it was surreal to walk around lower Manhattan and envision the events and landscapes Hamill evokes."
4,Very good,"I just finished this and was unable to put it down most of the time. As others have said it is rathar slow and plodding in the begining, but improves later. At that point the book flies. I feel it is a book I could read again and again. The descriptions of New York are magnificent."
3,Ambitious yet flawed.,"For a novel based in historical events, I would have expected the author to have had a better handle on period prose. His adjectorial use of a certain swear word is all too frequent and historically anachronistic. I did enjoy his character development but for a novel that spans such a large period of time, the work seems rushed - I was disappointed that more of the story wasn't told during the mid-19th and early 20th centuries."
1,A major disappointment,"This is what the novel supposedly is about: ""This is the magical, epic tale of Cormac O'Connor, who arrives in New York City from Ireland in 1741 and remains, well, forever. For Cormac has been given the gift of immortality, but only on the condition that he never leave the island of Manhattan."" Well I got as far as page 211 and gave up since this plot still hasn't occurred in the book. If Hamill ever got around to it, it might have been a good story, but I don't like authors wasting hours of my time waiting for a story that hasn't occurred."
2,Disappointing Conclusion,"Although the pace of this novel was, as other reviewers pointed out, a bit slow, the story did contain interesting historical and cultural information. If you buy-into the magical elements (which was a bit of a stretch even for a paranormal enthusiast such as myself), the story of Cormac's journey through history is engaging.However...I found the ending disappointing to the point of being annoying. Cormac's choices and ultimate fate were more like that of a romance novel than a respectable work of fiction. Considering his long journey through Irish, African and American history, his final choice (I won't be a spoiler and reveal it here) was inconsistent with both the character and common sense. Cormac, of all people, should have a better perspective on the fleeting nature of life...but he doesn't!"
2,More episodic than epic.,"As many other reviewers have said, the idea is intriguing. Could have made for a great historical epic. I loved ""Snow In August,"" a fantasy full of authenticity ... something about ""Forever"" didn't seem quite so authentic. I had doubts early on when Cormac's father suddenly told ""Robert"" that he was a Celt named Cormac O'Connor -- especially because what his father described sounded more like contemporary New Age 'Celtic paganism' (i.e. post-1950) than the multi-faceted warrior culture that Hamill seems to want it to be. A lot of things about the family seemed out-of-place in 18th Century Ireland. I also thought that it should have started with Cormac's desire for revenge, and that Hamill should have sent him to America right away.""Snow In August"" was a believable fantasy; this wasn't."
1,Awful,"I am a fan of historical fiction, a fan of all things Irish, and of New York City history so when I saw this book I picked it up immediately and excitedly. What a huge disappointment! I have not read Peter Hamill before, but I know a good story from a bad one and this is all bad. Try watching Star Wars on an old black and white TV with a broken static-filled speaker and you may have an idea of what it like to read this book. Characters were two-dimensional. I repeatedly got the impression that Pete Hamill had to finish this book as quickly as possible with little heed for telling a good story. I certainly did not lose any sleep on this one. Try Kevin Baker's Dreamland or Joseph O'Connor's Star of the Sea if you want a riveting story."
1,A Book Written By And For The Author; Not For The Reader,"Pete Hamill is a fine writer and his ""Snow In August"" is one of my all-time favs. But this ""Forever"" fantasy lacked a theme. The story was not unified like, for instance, a river... instead it fell all over the place, like rain. Some parts of New York;s history (and its characters) were ignored, others over exphasized. The sex and the hero's unusual, dream-like sexual partners strained the imagination. I can understand the ""pull"" these things have for a writer when spinning a fantasy, but I thought the author over indulged himself in that vein. Also, is it possible that Hamill's hero could live hundreds of years and learn so little? Develop so meagerly? I read every word because I trust Pete Hamill. I wasted my time. But - hey! - even the Babe struck out now and again."
2,Fluff and fantasy,"As some other reviewers, I was hugely disappointed in this book. I enjoyed some of the historical scenes but some of the dialogue and situations just made me roll my eyes. I could never quite get connected with Cormac who lives forever. Just when I was into the history, some bizarre feat of fantasy would interrupt. I especially felt the ending was contrived. The book had potential, but just did not live up to it."
2,Unexpected disappointment!,"I found this book to scratch so many historic surfaces yet never once did I find any depth. Hamill's writing causes me to read and want more, but never got it!"
3,Such potential..,"What a great idea. To write a book about a young idealistic 18th century Irishman who, after journeying to New York to avenge his father's death, is granted immortality under the condition that he remain in Manhattan.For me, the best part of the book were the scenes (and smells!!) from New York, and the history we learn. I wish we had more of that.I thought the beginning of the book that took place in Ireland went on a little too long for my taste...as I said, I enjoyed the New York stuff more. I also thought the book read a little bit like a Young Adult novel, especially in the beginning, with Cormac's family a little too ""perfect"" for my taste.And lastly, I felt that the book tended to show a lot of stereotypes. And I just couldn't seem to kick that feeling that the book was meant for a younger audience.Overall, the book was entertaining, and the mortality issue and end of the book was resolved in a satisfying way."
4,Very good...but not great.,"Educational, lyrical, a lot of fun. Bogs down in parts, and gets overly sentimental here and there...but now that I'm finished with it, I miss my pal Cormac. Like the Amazon review says, Forever requires suspension of disbelief in large measures, but if you can do that, and slog through the treacly parts, it's worth it."
3,Gaps and Unanswered questions,"The premise of Forever grabbed my attention - an Irishman living for eternity on the island of Manhattan. Usually, I am more interested in the characters, but I was more facinated by the historical references of New York - the uprising of the Irish and African slaves and the destruction of lower Manhattan. I was bored with the main character (what's his name again?). He seemed inconsistent as a person. He was vengeful but compassionate. Poor but living in an big apartment. Old, acted old, but looked young. He was aimless in life with the exception of finding his sword and killing the murderer's ancestors. The historical references of New York was jumpy and often times made me wonder more about the aftereffects of New York City rather than the main character, what's his face."
2,"A poor man's version of Helprins' ""Winter's Tale""","In fact, did Hamill take Helprins outline and just change things around?Here are the similarities: 1) An epic told over several centuries 2) based in New York 3) with weather as a key 'character' 4) with young male immigrant protagonist 5) who is orphaned except 6) has a relationship with a magical flying horse which appears in desperate times of need.7) Protagonist also is saved from the brink of death ,8) is given immortality 9) learns many languages and trades- 10) oh did i mention that he was also a newspaper man??? 11) In the end finds himself ""actualized"" through the predetermined love of woman.I'm sure i could go on but it's been two years since I read the much more rewarding ""Winters Tale"". 12)I should mention that both Hamill and Helprin are journalists and novelists."
3,A different shade of Tweed,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Great original concept and story. The empathy you have for the protagonist could not be greater. But....the way in which Hamill shows his political bias is comical to say the least. He paints Boss Tweed as a nice man who did more good than harm. The fact that he was the most corrupt politician in American history just never seems to come up. He never mentions Tammany Hall or the Democratic Party political machine that fixed elections and had black men swinging from lamp posts during the Draft Riots. Instead he blames it all on Bush, mentioning the corrupt Republicans in Albany as the root cause several times. This is the biggest rewrite of history in a historical novel I have ever read. What a spinmeister Mr. Hamill has become or maybe always was as I really was unfamiliar with him until now."
5,Absolutely amazing,"I could not put this book down. I had one of those incredible experiences of wanting to read the entire thing -- fast -- so I'd find out what happens, but wanted to read it slowly because I didn't want it to end.I understand Hamill re-wrote the ending (since he finished the book on Sept. 10) and his description of 9/11 is shattering. I loved every moment of this magnificent book, and will buy copies for everyone I know."
4,Good summer read for lovers of Big Apple,"For a writer like Hamill whose best work is centered on New York, it's a shame that ""Forever"" seems to lose a bit of steam as soon as the main character sets foot on Manhattan island. The first chapters set in a devastated and demon-haunted Ireland are beautifully written and compelling. But Cormac's adventures in the New World take on a high school history class slideshow-like quality as the novel skips from period to period. And as much as I admire Hamill's multiculturalism, by about the fourth dusky femme fatale that Cormac conquers it started to curdle into a kind of condescending exoticism. Hamill can still write the pants off most authors out there, however, and glimpses of some lesser-known periods of New York history are fascinating. Altogether well worth a look."
1,"Annoying, Boring, Crap.","Noticed how I cleverly used ABC in the title of my review. Those are the first 3 letters in the alphabet! Get it. That's about how clever Forever is. I became so annoyed with this boring book that I abandonded it somewhere in Thailand. It was the last book I brought on my trip, but, after a few hundred pages, I felt no book was better than this book. If you like books about a person who has a telepathic relationship with his horse and dog and vice versa, then this book is for you.I rarely review books on Amazon, but this book was such a waste of money, time and paper that I felt it my duty to warn fellow readers. If you like children's books, then read one of those, not this fantastical Easy Cheese."
2,"Way Too Wordy, Pacing Way Too Slow","I also read this book, as another reviewer did, because of my love for New York, but the first several chapters lingered way too long in Ireland and I forced myself not to skim that part, to get to New York already. I believe Mr. Hamill could have told this story in about half the time, because of the plethora of unnecessary details that didn't push the story forward. As an author and an editor, I also found it wasn't very well written--there was much use of passive voice, some grammatical errors, and the prose could have been much tighter. It read like Mr. Hamill wrote a first draft, dashed it off to the publisher who didn't spend much time on copyediting, and rushed it into print. A DRINKING LIFE was worlds better."
1,Disappointment,"I like historical novels which is why I bought this book. It turned out to be a disappointment. It is badly in need of editing. Very wordy, boring and a very tedious read. After finding that I was skipping large amounts of text just to ""get on with it,"" i decided to quit reading. Not worth the time."
2,Fantasy writing at its worst,"I started this book with high hopes, but by page 290 I was fed up and had to ditch it for my own sanity. I liked the beginning of the story about the main character's upbringing in Ireland and also when he moved to NYC. But once the riots began and the war broke out the book just seemed to get weirder by the page. The writing in the middle of the book is rather choppy and disjointed; difficult to follow. What I thought would be a beautiful and well written novel turned out to be nothing more than fantasy writing -- and not good fantasy writing."
2,"Readable, but that's about it.","Suspension of disbelief is impossible with this novel. Our hero very conveniently knows everyone who's anyone, and gets to participate in all the major events in NYC history, Zelig style. Cormac is raised with 21st century values by his 18th century Jewish/Irish parents, which is convenient for the reader -- no messy racist attitudes for our Cormac (and I have to quibble with Hamill's explanation that Noah's daughters were the Jewish ancestors of Cormac's mother -- Noah wasn't Jewish, the beginnings of Judaism date from the covenant with Abraham, many generations later).Hamill keeps things moving, though, and if you have a day or so with nothing to do, the mise-en-scene descriptions of old New York are certainly worth the time."
3,Fell short,"It had promise. I read through it hopeing it'd get better. But Cormac just didn't come to life. Even before he turned immortal I just couldn't get a feel for him, he felt more like a random body tossed in and used to tell the stories around him. Which could have worked but the stories around him failed to be as interesting as they should have been. The one charecter that captured my attention (Mary Burton) was gone almost just as quickly, and it seems like Cormac never feels anything. Except for when it's extream grief and need for revenge. Could have been better. Much Better. But if somone else (or even the same author) gave it another shot I'd read it."
2,Forever fails!,"Not a great choice for women- too much talk of balls, and sh%^, not to mention revolutions and sex without commitment. The premise is appealing- a person that gets to live effectively many different lives. But the stories are more like disconnected vignettes than one coherent tale (it is not surprising other reviewers have either loved the ireland vignette or the new york vignettes). More importantly, it fails because it is dark without levity for balance. Without levity, we cannot ""really live life"" or ""remove the sludge"" - the very things the author commands us to do. If you're tempted by the history of new york, you're better off with a text book."
5,Awesome historical fiction,I found this book irresistable. I loved the journey through NY's history- and am not one to dwell on plausibilty (re: the plot). If you love NYC and seeing 250 years of history through one person's eyes- you will love this book. An awesome read.
2,"Great Beginning, poor middle - didn't finish it","This was my first Peter Hamill book. I had heard much good stuff on reviews about this author. I choose the book at random, well mostly at random - i was interested in the NewYork theme. I was overjoyed when i read the first 39 chapters - don't get excited that was only 150 pages!. I was immersed in the story and I loved the North or Ireland story of growing up in south Belfast many years ago. A place I have spent many years in myself. When the story moves to NY the pace of the story changes and the quality of the plot changes with it. I got really bored with Cormac the reporter theme. Maybe it was my own fault for enjoying the Irish theme too much and not wanting it to change. Maybe I have no patience. Either way I didn't finish it and donated the book to my work book club. With so much choice of books today I moved on."
1,Skip it....,"Although this novel is filled with the extremely interesting history of New York, and, the premise is promising the character development is so weak that I soon found myself rolling my eyes and wondering if, indeed, the book would go on ""Forever"". Skip this one..."
5,Amazingly Comfortable and Lightweight!,These shoes are amongst the best I have ever tried for people with wider feet. I run a good deal (20-25 miles/wk) and these shoes hold up very well under a great deal of duress. I'm now on my third pair of these and will continue to purchase them for as long as they are available for purchase.
4,Waiters with voices,"This is an engaging story of activism in the early days of AIDS. But that's only the backdrop: it's really more the story of how lives can change suddenly and dramatically. The setting, mostly, is the upscale world of New York diners, who treat the gay waiters like their servants. The guys cope with the advent of this strange new disease and the new out-there protest group (ACT-UP) that appears.The main character, Lee, is attracted to this vocal, policy-changing mob, and feels like with social activism, he might have found his passion in life. Other characters are equally colorful: Brian, who tries life as a hustler; a club-hopper boy, a bi-curious sculptor, and more.It's a colorful, detailed look at a moment in time in our history--with all the laughs, tears and drama you'd expect."
2,"World class,east or west...","With TNT on hiatus,Tony Harnell did not waste any time putting together another great band:Westworld.This is their amazing debut album,and every minute of it bears the mark of a supergroup(Westworld comprises members of TNT,Danger Danger,Riot ,and Rainbow).Great vocal harmonies and amazing arrangements will keep the listener interested spin after spin...it is bands like this that will put rock'n'roll back on the map.A four star album!"
3,WESTWORLD ........ its worth checking out,"WESTWORLD ,.....is a decent debut ,....TONY HARNELL sounds great on this CD ........they are no TNT ,.....but its still a good 1st effort , worth buying."
4,written for a general audience,"Dr. Seager's book is a fine introduction to the problems of mental illness among the homeless. Written as a first-person narrative (which at times does become a little too melodramatic), he still manages to discuss the problem. If you're a mental health professional, some of the material is a little basic, but this is a good book to give to your friends to help them to understand what you do on a daily basis. Seager's portraits put a human face on the homeless and mentally ill. Those who read this book may never be able to pass by that guy on the street begging for change again."
4,Excellent for Preprofessional Instructors,"FOUNDATIONS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION provides an excellent basis for preprofessional instructors (students who are going to become teachers). The history and philosophy sections are not too involved with jargon to be useful to undergraduates. On the other hand, for those who have been away from teaching for a few years, for parents who want to find out what's going on, and for students who haven't previously examined education as history, this is a good start. The insets and anecdotes that are set apart from the main body of the text by boxes and underlining are somewhat confusing, but they also contain ideas that should be explored. The prose ranges from stilted to nicely-flowing."
4,TEL 505 book,It's a pretty good book for a textbook. Focuses on the historical data and analysis of how American Education came to be as it is today; from it's roots as small unorganized Quaker schools in the new world.
4,Laying foundations,"I purchased this book for a graduate course in education. Switching from a business major, I lack the basic foundation of the education industry. This book provides a great introduction to the basics of foundation including how the knowledge will help you in the certification process, applicable laws to know, philophies of education, and will lead you to a deeper understanding of INTASC standards. In addition to this it gives you a brief history of education in America.Note - this books DOES NOT include access to MyEducationLab. I found this book beneficial without this feature. However, you also DO NOT have access to the Insight feature which are videos that further clarify various points in the text. This information would be very beneficial and would have helped clarify a few questions I had."
4,mixed feelings,"As far as the item that I got is concerned it is everything that I wanted. What frustrates me is the time it took to get it. It came on the last possible day of the supposed shipping time, which happens to be over a month from the time I actually ordered it. Waiting a month to get a textbook for a class is not helpful!"
1,Bad Sound and Terrible Selection - Luther Deserves Better,"What is the problem. Mastering off the vinyl - you can still hear the pops on this disc. In this age of digital the audience deserves better. Luther was great and recorded a lot of great stuff, but they left off the best recordings on this one."
1,Good eyes required...,"Good eyes are required to enjoy this item. Did thorough research prior to purchase, hoping to find a user friendly screen. This product clearly looked most promising, at least as described and in pictures online. In reality, the screen is too dark for comfortable, other than brief play. Would definitely not recommend for seniors and is questionable for those interested in a portable device."
1,I threw away my money,"Excalibur LCD Deluxe BridgeThis product is useless, a complete waste!! The printed numbers are so small and the print so poor as to be indecipherable. With great concentration, I can tell one suit from another, but it makes the going slow. It bears little resemblance to actually playing bridge. I do play bridge online, and thought this might be a good substitute, but it's no fun and too hard to read. I wish I could get my money back."
2,Cover is more interesting than the book turns out to be,"This cover drew me with its fresh colors, but once I got inside I realized that it didn't give me as much as I expected. There are other decorating books that do an even better job of teaching decorating basics than this one."
2,"Good basics in a unique, tabbed format","I agree with an earlier reviewer who said that this book is helpful, because it explains design theory and underlying principles. However, I have found that another book, titled The New Decorating Book (by Better Homes and Gardens magazine), does a better job of this. It's beautiful but also serves as a teacher. I learned about The New Decorating Book last winter when my daughter brought it home from school where it's being used to teach interior design basics."
5,Instructional,"This was a great book in explaining the elements of decorating. It doesn't have room pictures, but it throughly explores important aspects of decorating, such as color, fabric, flooring, and architecture. It is a great teaching book."
4,Great Decorating Book,"Great pictures and detailed information. e.g., proper measurement of windows, etc. Very good but I liked Domino: The Book of Decorating: A Room-by-Room Guide to Creating a Home That Makes You Happy, much more."
5,Best Decorating Book on the Market,"Room Redux is by far the best decorating book out on the market today. There is an incredible amount of information in this book, but it is presented in an abundantly clear and easy-to-access format. To me, it's like the Joy of Cooking for home design--for anything you need help with, an answer resides within. You also get the feeling that the authors are good friends talking you through each step, unlike so many dry and boring decorating books out there. Lastly, there are wonderful features to this book like pockets for paint chips and fabric swatches and cut-out furniture pieces for floor plans. If you're going to buy one decorating book, this is the one to buy. And, believe me, I know--I've read just about every book out there!"
4,"Loved this book, and it was very helpful!","I was looking for a basic, in-layman's-terms book that would give me a general knowledge of home decorating, and this book definitely did that. This book is like a decorating 101 course. It has pop-out furniture pieces that you can use to rearrange your furniture, pockets to keep paint samples and clippings handy, graph paper to sketch out room designs, etc. I really liked the chapter on color, too. My husband and I are building our first home, and this book will really come in handy as we go through the building process. I'm glad that I bought it."
4,Super guitar album,"If you're into guitar music of any kind (I love Eric and Jimmy Page and many others) or you're into ""Latin"" music, you will love this album. In my dreams I can play guitar like these guys. Oh well, maybe in another life. Super, super stuff. Their live performances are better, catch them if you can."
5,Outstanding!,"Intimo is a joy to listen to from beginning to end. The percussionists, the bass, the guitars...they're all excellent! Play it in the background at a dinner party and I guarantee someone will ask you what it is and where to get their own copy. Over 70 minutes long and not a dull moment. I will absolutely be expanding my collection in the near future!"
4,Good heat and good flavor,"This sauce has a good delicately balanced flavor, I can understand why it is a favorite sauce among it's fans. The flavor is balanced with no one particular one ingredient taking over. It is a farily simple hot sauce flavor profile with vinegar, garlic and onion boosted with citrus to make it interesting.I have to admit, it was not quite as hot as I was expecting after seeing it had both habaneros and pepper extract in the ingredients, and from the many warnings on the label about how dangerously hot it was. Don't be fooled though, this is still a very, very hot sauce. I have had other sauces without extracts that were as hot as this which is the only reason I bring this up. I suppose it could be possible the batch I got was weak for some reason and I did not get a typical sample.This is a good sauce, I would recommend it to others."
5,Best Hot Sauce Ever!,This stuff is HOT but has a great flavor. I am a hot sauce collector and have over 250 different hot sauces. This is my absolute favorite.
4,LADY LAISTEE BEST FEMALE RAPPER???,"Lady Laistee's first album is quite good. Yo, this female can rap. Although I do agree with another customer that most of the songs are quite simalar, and you can get bored from this album very soon, nonetheless, i dont think you can find another female rapper with skill and talent that Lady Laistee has. She touches all aspects of life with her lyrics. The best song on this cd is ""Les Keufs Me Matent"", that song will make you listen to it over and over again.Any comments on French Rap or Hip-Hop, please e-mail me.Peace out everyone"
2,it's ok,the shape of this item is not as I expected and I'm not 100% percent happy with this purchase. I expected something of a better quality.
1,aquamarine cz band,"As in the other rings of same style from same vendor, I am very disappointed. The stones fall out immediately on first wear and they are not brilliant as one would like. Can not clean them as the silver goes dark, and since there is silver between each stone the ring is dull. I wore each of the 4 (diff colors) I purchased only once. So I would consider these disposable rings and will not be purchasing from this vendor again."
3,Teacher's Grade: B,"I'm a second grade teacher and found Coville's book to have a lot of strengths, but also found it to be overlong and drawn out.The story itself is timeless: Kill a dragon destroying the kingdom. The characters are caricatures, however, and all seem to have come out of a character-factory. The story zips along nicely, with plenty of action, but gets muddled due to an excessive amount of characters who have very little to do to the plot besides pad the pages.Overall, I'm not sure what audience Coville was trying to reach. The dialogue and some of the situations seem designed for Grades 5-8, but the lack of details and amount of silliness seem intended for kids in grades 2-4.I wouldn't read this aloud to my 2nd grades, but might give it to a 4th grade teacher to share."
3,WHAT A GOOOOD BOOK,"In the book 'The Dragonslayers"" there were 2 witches who made a dragon who caused a lot of trouble. My favorite character is the princess because she wanted to kill the dragon but her dad would not let her but she did any way. My favorite part was when the witches were arguing about what to put in the mix to create the dragon. I would encourage any body to read this book if they like witches that argue and mean dragons. Its a real good book."
3,"A Bit Talky, Underwhelming Princess Becomes Dragonslayer Story",I was disappointed by this book but will make reservations to see how my students like it. To me this story was talky (lots of dialog) that goes nowhere and meanders along until the end. The story is the typical not typical fairy tale of a princess who wants to do the things boys do. She goes out into the world to become a dragonslayer. Yeah! Unfortunately this new twist on an old tale has become an old tired twist that isn't very refreshing.
5,What I Thought Of Bruce Coville's The Dragonslayers,I thought the book was very good it had a very interesting plot. Some of the characters traits were kind of weird such as a talking bear or fox. I think Coville Caught all readers attention in the first chapter. The first few sentences really hook you and draw you in to what the book is going to be like. Altogether it was a very good exciting book I think Coville is a very talented writer. He has hooked me with this book I think the next book that I am going to read is going to be is aliens ate my homework. I like this author he has drawn me in to his web of writing talents.
4,A semi-great book,I think it was a good book. It had a rather interesting large plot with good character develoment. I like how he placed every thing to happen at a certain time in the book to make it more exciting. i would recomend it. :-)
4,"Allthough Dave is gone, the magic is still there","I viewed this DVD with pessimistic thoughts in mind. But after about ten seconds of Michael Anthony's Ultra Bass, I was in shock. I almost told Drieho to call an ambulance. It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen done with a bass guitar. Also, Eddie Van Halen's guitar is astounding throughout the entire disc. I would recommend this Digital Video Disc to a music fan of any genre."
5,"By far, one of the greatest live bands ever.","This video is one of the best examples of what a rock concert should be like. I can pretty much guarantee, for those that like this video, that actually going to one of Van Halen's concerts will blow you away. It is truly an amazing thing to see."
2,DOES NOT COME CLOSE TO CONCERTS OF EARLY YEARS (1978-1984),"Van Halen has been my band since I was five years old. However, I cannot delude myself and accept that this is the best they have to offer. First, I had to fast forward through all the songs because I couldn't stand listening to Sammy Hagar screech. Second, if this version of the band is so great, why do they play some of their old classics? Face it VH fans, when the band was in its glory days, David Lee Roth was outrageous on stage and Eddie was ferocious on guitar. ""Right Here, Right Now"" had neither of these two elements; which makes it a waste of time. VH fans should go to Amazon Auctions and bid on rare concert footage that includes Roth."
2,Van Halen live,To bad this concert is only available in a dolby 2.0 sound version. Also the concert is filmed over a two day period which makes it very strange to look at as the members change clothes during each song.Wish they would have made a DVD of their last tour in 2004. Hopefully they will film the 2007 tour with David Lee Roth.
1,"Van Halen DVD Right Here, Right Now","Disk was supposed to have been brand new, but was scratched, and unplayable. Totally unsatisfactory. Would like to send this back for a new replacement, but the instructions say it cannot be sent back if it was opened. How do you know if a product is new if you cannot open it to find out? Looked like a repackaging of a used DVD to me. I am very unhappy with your service provided at this time, and will be telling my friends unless a replacement is sent immediately.Sincerely unsatisfied,Christine Johnson"
2,Bad Investment,"If you want to own ONE Van Halen CD, this is not the one! The sound quality is terrible... sounds like someone smuggled in a tape recorder then attempted to burn it onto a CD. Very poor quality."
2,Van Hagar finally loses the plot.,This DVD starts well for about 8 minutes and then slowly puts the watcher to sleep. Bits and pieces cut up to make up a concert. It's obvious to me that VH cannot play a concert through without things going wrong. Eddie's guitar solo piece is particularly disappointing as he makes so many mistakes. The other disappointment is that he has not written any additional original guitar solo work since the 'without a net' video. Shame Dave Lee Roth never released a live DVD when he was with Steve Vai. It would have made Van Hagar look like a bunch of amateurs.
3,almost perfect but not quite,this video is ok but Live Without a Net is the real deal hope it comes out on dvd soon
4,"Great performance, horrible editing.","I'll just add to the litany of dissatisfaction with this video. First off, since this is the only live DVD, I have to recommend it, just to see them play and listen to the incredible sounding music. The performance is great, they don't miss a note.Unfortunately, the original high quality video shooting is utterly butchered by editing two shows together. As mentioned by many others, it destroys any sense of ""being there"". It's basically the equivalent of lip-syncing, but worse. It's like reverse lip-syncing, the moron director syncing a different performance to the music.And another annoying factor is how often the director cuts away from Eddie right in the middle of a guitar solo in a song. Quite unbelievable.Nevertheless, like I said, this is all we got, as far as DVD, so it's certainly better than nothing. Just sit back, squint your eyes to not focus on the video too much, and enjoy the music."
2,Image and sound quality are not very well.,"The video quality of this DVD is average and this DVD has only PCM sound, no surround available.The image quality isThe bass is big, but not clear. The treble is average also."
1,worthless,"I love Van Halen, but this is a joke!, it's not a real concert, in many parts it's kind of a playback!, you see them playing the same song and they're dress different! (they use footage from several nights I guess).Bottomline: Don't waste your money, just listen to the cd."
5,I forgot to add this to my first review...,"About the controversial editing,I think that it's both outstanding and mediocre.It's brilliant because the DVD combines the best elements of both nights of the concert,which makes the concert absolutely amazing.But the problem is that instead of focusing on a single band member or the band as a whole,the camera shoots from a far distance.This happens a lot,and it's pretty annoying.Nevertheless,the editing as a whole is spectacular and brilliant.When they shoot Eddie,they focus on his hands most fo the time.What a feeling it is,watching a close up of the greatest guitarist in the world doing a blisteringly fast solo."
5,"Who cares, it's Van Halen","You can quibble about the lighting and sound of this recording--you never see the performers fully lit for instance. Whatever comments and suggestions others may make, this is Van Halen...if you are a fan, buy this...period. The guitar work itself, if there were no vocals, would be worth the price of admission..I mean, it's Van Halen, man!"
2,Horrible sound on an amazing concert...,It's incredible the bad quality of the sound of this DVD. Sammy Hagar voice is extremely low. A shame! It's a better video the 'Live without a Net' VHS. Would love to see that in DVD!!
4,"Good, gentle but a bit drying","I found this soap very good to my face but it is always essential to use a good moisturizer. If you have a good moisturizer that does not feel too greasy, then this soap is perfect for you. I found the bar to last me roughly 2 months after every day use twice a day. The smell is not particularly good, but can be tolerated. It foams nicely during wash, something I like as it makes it easier to apply onto my face."
3,I liked the Purpose Gentle Cleansing Bar a ...,I liked the Purpose Gentle Cleansing Bar a lot. It was a gentle soap that I felt comfortable using on my face and my baby's skin. The soap lathered nicely and had a pleasant smell. It left my skin feeling very clean and soft. I'll definitely buy this product in the future.
3,I found this to be particularly good for ...,"I found this to be particularly good for my sometimes overly sensitive skin, though I did find it a bit drying. However, it was non-irritating. It wasn't especially good at removing make-up and I found I needed a makeup remover first, followed by the soap."
