3,great until it stopped working,Its maybe 2yrs old and now it always says paper jam even when it has been cleared. I have tried everything and will prob have to send it to the landfill and get another one.
4,"Good Value, Good Results","I have had this all-in-one up and running for three weeks now. Overall, I am very satisfied with it. It is not the very best of anything, but it does a good job at everything. Installation was easy. Un-boxing through software loading to printing took about 30 minutes. No problems what so ever using Microsoft XP Home SP2 operating system.Document printing: reasonably fast and images and text are clear.Photo printing: About what you would expect at this price level. Images are mostly sharp, and colors are slightly off. Don't buy if you are expecting professional quality photo printing. For a quick print of a digital snapshot, it's perfect. Make sure to use the glossy photo paper for best results.Scanning: using the higher resolution settings, images are sharp and clear. Default settings are not.Overall, it is a very good value. You would have to spend a lot more to see noticeably better results."
1,Bad Printer..Had to return for full refund..Tech Support no help,"I bought the printer due to all the positive remarks but I guess I was the unlucky one. First time I Turned on the printer and troubleshooting is already required. I called tech support and he could not help. He said I have a ""faulty printer, thanks for calling, bye"". Oh well, on to the next printer."
5,How to save the family.,"A compilation of G.K. Chesterton's writings on men and women, children, sex, divorce, marriage, and the family, Chesterton's essays are as appropriate today as they were when they were written.Chesteron, as only Chesterton can, defends the sacredness of marriage and the home so desperately in need of salvaging today.Broken into short chapters, the book is easily read and very enjoyable."
1,Not impressive,"Although decorated well, the homes picutred were not dream interiors. The pictures were poor in parts and the text uninspiring. I paid too much for so little."
5,an amazing work,"Dictee is a seminal work that has strongly influenced those poets lucky enough to have read it in the decades since it first appeared. It has had an underground reputation for decades, and now is beginning to be known to the mainstream. Yes, Dictee is rooted in the specifics of her family's immigrant experience, in the specifics of Korea and of America, in the specifics of gender, but it explodes across time, space and cultures, it transcends form, and ultimately it transforms the reader's consciousness of what can be done with writing and how you can perceive your life. I am tempted to say ""if Cha had lived longer she would have been one of our major writers"" but in fact she *is* one of the major writers of the second half of the 20th century, on the strength of this one work alone. I am delighted that Dictee is soon to appear in an addition with more of Cha's work."
2,Condition and fast delivery good,"Well this book was a bit confusing. If you like a challenge well then this book is for you. The best part was the images, aside from quick delivery that I needed it ASAP for a class."
1,Chaotic and Painful,"As a piece of art perhaps it would work, but as a piece of literature it stands as a scathing indictment of postmodernity, in love with its own disjointed voice. Its lack of punctuation and dodging between languages and fragmented ""stories"" seems to purposeless expression. Professors of graduate literature programs and Asian Studies programs will likely make you suffer through this at some point, and gush about its commentary on disenfranchised Asian-Americans."
5,Traveling Light Years To My Mailbox,"Happy Happy! I ordered this CD Feb. 2nd, paying witha check. My check arrived last week, and this was sent out to me Feb. 20th. The suggested dates of acquirement was Feb. 23-March 1. Well today is the 23rd, and my CD has traveled right into my CD Player! :)My first order (and not my last) from Amazon, and my first Kylie album (and not my last). This CD is an excellent dance pop collection, loaded with high-octane dance spitfires like ""Disco Down"" and ""Your Disco"", rockin' pop tunes like ""Kids"", and top hits like ""Spinning Around"" and ""On a Night"". I'm definitely not regretting this purchase! After this, I hope Kylie can get her albums some release over here, hopefully her next will be released here! :)"
5,"Buy this disc NOW !! Before they ""Americanize"" it !","This disc kicks major backside! From start to finish you'll hear Kylie Minogue at her unbelievable best. ""Butterfly"", ""Disco down"", ""Spinning around"" and ""Your disco needs you"" are tons of fun. This disc is supposed to be released in the U.S. in the fall of 2001, but after its been edited and made more accessible for the American audience thats obsessed with teenage pop singers and boy bands (all of which are interchangable). I suggest you get the original before its ruined. And if thats not enough, she has a real ""new"" album coming out overseas called ""Fever"" that already has a smash single to its credit(Cant get you out of my head)."
5,An amazing pop CD,Kylie Minogue's Light Years has got to be one of the best CD's out there.I recently heard abpout her from amazon recamendations and searched the net for places to download a couple of the songs off Light Years to hear what her music was like.I was very impressed by what I had heard so I took a chance on Light Years and instantly fell head over heels for the CD.All the songs are a amazing.Kylie has a very much unique voice and very original lyrics which is somthing you don't find a lot.I can't wait for the next Kylie CD.Her new single off her new CD(Can't Get You Out Of My Head)is amazing.Keep up the great work Kylie.
2,In The Past,"After quite a lot of hype about this c.d. (well - there was in the UK) I was pretty dissappointed when I finally got around to buying and listening to it. The two dance(ish) songs - 'Spinning Around' and 'On a Night Like This' are fairly good, although pretty average as far as a dance tune goes. The duet with Robbie - 'Kids' is also good (but if you want to have this single buy the Robbie album instead - 'Sing when your Winning'). However, the rest of the album is utterly awful - all the songs seem to be stuck in the 80's. Its a shame to say that Kylie hasn't moved on!! Its also worth noting that the three fairly good songs on the album (mentoined above) are the only ones not written with Kylie's input. The rest of the songs are written partly by Kylie and they certainly do reflect her influence as they are all bad 80's style songs."
1,The cover says it all...,"After attempting to listen to the awful musical train-wreck called ""Fever"", I thought that I would see if her earlier work was any good. After all, some performers' earlier work is better that their new stuff. But I'm afraid this CD is just as terrible as ""Fever"", her only talent seems to be displaying her booty on the cover (although it is a very nice booty). I'm spoiled I guess, listening to good house/club music like Ben Watt, Sasha&Digweed, Faithless and others. Why do people like bad club garbage like this? It always mystifies me. Support good music, watch her videos if you must (I recommend turning the sound down while watching her bounce around the screen) don't buy this lame CD."
5,The Princesses Return To The Disco!,This album is probably her most well put together of the 2000's though I love all of her albums this one sticks out as top dog. From Spinning around till the amazing club banging song Light years this cd delivers the goods plus if you play it on a regular stereo or walkman (not your computer) and you rewind it before the song Spinning around there you'll find the hidden track Password which is really a gem. Every fan should own this buy it now!
5,This CD Made me a fan!,"This CD made me a fan from the first track ""Spinning Around"", to the last, ""Light Years"". My favorite track is ""Kids"", her duet with Robbie Williams. I would recommend this CD to anyone who isn't familiar with Kylie's style of music. If you like a mixture of dance/techno you'll love this album!"
1,blah blah.......boring.,"This album is so not the kylie music i adore. It's not worth the cost and, in my opinion, there is only if that one good song (spinning around). If you are new to kylie....i suggest getting her lastest, fever, it's surely the best."
3,OK.,"Some great tracks, but hit-or-miss songwriting delivers a weak overall effort. Village People knock-offs hurt the disk. It's the poor songs in the disk (about 40%) that keep Kylie from becoming the international superstar she could be.Get better songwriters!"
2,Unnecessary to buy!,"I don't understand why many people think highly of this album...To me,it's just dull,dull,dull!I think this album is totally imbalanced,the rest of the CD make extreme contrast to the singles,which are the only songs worth listening to.Some people describe it as camp fun,well,I don't know what that is,but I'm sure camping would be much more fun without necessarily playing this music.Personally,I think this is the most unconsistent album Kylie Minogue has ever made by far!Guys,if you wanna get your hands on Kylie,I only recommend buying or downloading ""Fever"" and ""Impossible Princess"",those are the only Kylie records worth buying."
2,Skip This One,"There are only 2 good songs on this album: ""Spinning Around"" and ""On a Night Like This"". Both are availible on her ""Ultimate Kylie"" compilation, so there's no need to purchase this album. Well, ""Love Boat"" is also okay, but you don't NEED to own it."
5,This is the coolest thing ever...,I actually got this for my boss for Christmas one year (I should have gotten one for myself). It it the coolest thing I have ever seen. When she first took it out of the box it was pretty to look at but there wasn't much to it then you start seeing things growing and it changing!
5,12+ years and still going strong,"I have had a 5 inch ecosphere for over 12 years. It came with 3 shrimp. The first 2 died within the first few months but the 3rd shrimp is still going strong after 12 years. People are amazed when they hear how old ""shrimpy"" is. My kids love explaining how the ecosphere works to their friends. A fellow reviewer was right, they really don't need too much light. Indirect light in a bright room is best."
2,Very Dissapointed,I was out of town and ordered it for my wife on line. When I was able to see it I was totally shocked how small it was. The picture over stated its size.
2,Cannot justify the price,"I tried dowelmax and it worked well, but I could not justify the price for my applications. Finally I picked up Jessem dowel jig over dowelmax. IMO, Jessem is better than, at least as good as dowelmax but much cheaper. When you are looking for a decent dowel jig, you may want to look at both jigs to make a decision."
4,One small problem,"Fantastic jig,use it all he time. No need to ramble on ...my one problem is, the dowelmax jig should be fabricated from a less flexable material. The aluminum will flex when using on hardwoods, enough to have a negative impact on overall precision. Who cares about weight? ...use something stronger.......other than that I give it a 5........"
5,"Excellent tool, very versatile","This is easily the most versatile doweling jig on the market. It lets you place dowels relative to a reference face with great precision. Note that this is a lot more useful than a standard doweling jig that only places dowels in a self centering location. Also, you can place sequential dowels with similarly excellent precision.The tool is easy to use and the accompanying documentation and video is excellent. The jig is well made and sturdy.My only gripe with the product itself is that it would be somewhat easier to use if it were slightly larger. The jig is only about four inches long.Having said that, it is an excellent tool and a nice complement to biscuit and pocket hole joinery. It adds a lot of flexibility to woodworking. I would buy it again."
5,First job perfect! Used over 60 dowels,"First all the people who say this is an engineering work of art - they are correct. It's beautiful to look at and hold (if you love tools).I did my first job with it yesterday - joining two 2""x8""x10' boards together lengthwise. As this is going to be a desktop with one board not supported I wanted a very strong joint. I drilled holes for ~60 dowels in a double row along each board. When I joined them they all lined up perfectly. It was super easy and fast to do. I can't imagine having done this with a ""cheapo"" jig.It's expensive but it'll save you lots of time and money from not messing up your materials. Do it right the first time - use the right tool!The only problem is I can see myself needing lots more dowels. It is easy go overboard with the number of dowels you use. I may order several hundred the next time!I can also see myself buying the kit for the smaller dowels in the future."
4,Well... It was OK....,"It wasn't that bad, but not as good as I expected... I liked some. So... check it out!"
5,Love this book,This book is very cute. My little girl loves it. Jules Feiffer really gets kids.We are very happy with our purchase.
3,Parent's alert,"We borrowed this book from the library, and my son loved it. He began playacting that he'd lost his bear after one read and asked to hear the story frequently. A word of caution, though: the book contains the script ""If you lose my [stuffed toy], I'll kill you!"" You can change the dialog, as we did when we read it -- but if it troubles you, you might want to reconsider buying this book."
4,Nice read,"If you're looking for a smooth weekend read, you won't be disappointed in this book. The characters are rounded and the plot is believable. My only gripe is that the ending is a little predictable and it drags on just a bit. But an overall nice book and I'll be looking for this author's next work."
2,trashy romance novel meets inconceivably unimaginative plot,"i was disappointed with this novel, especially after reading its rave reviews from this site. the characters are relatively flat, the plot is predictable and uninteresting, and the typos and overall poor writing is the icing on the lesbian meatloaf.try Tipping the Velvet if you enjoy thoughtful writing with intriguing character development. i'm selling this book on ebay. :)"
4,Woowhee this was fun!,"This was a really fun read and diverting on a lot of levels. I like thrillers and while lots of lesbians are writing mysteries, I think only Therese Szymanski is writing thrillers, so I was pleased to read this book for that reason alone.Better yet, this is the work of a professional. I am so tired of self-published documents disguised as books being hyped and sold at high prices -- I've been burned. Cameron Abbott knows how to write a correct sentence, and intriguing, character-driven dialog. Compare the sample on her website to what you'll find at the website for Around We Go (for example) and you'll see exactly what I mean. There's just no comparison. To the Edge is an excellent novel produced by professionals and worth every penny.You'll notice that writer Lori Lake has also written a review for this book and I won't bother repeating the things she said, which are all true."
4,"Interesting read, but a bit predictable.","The book is a marvelous first attempt; the plot is neat, the main characters interesting and mature as they age, and the villains are easy to hate. The narrative weaves much of the magic, although the sequencing can be a bit predictable. I love how Abbott portrays the the rawness of emotions in the little plot twists. I hope she continues on this level of fine writing for her future productions..."
4,Great Deal Great Product,I think it was a great deal and a great product and I will purchase Hawthorne products in the future.Thank you
2,tstispp,"When I purchased the set, I only neded the 1/4"" bit, but the price was too good to pass up. I now know why. Ten minutes into my first use, the 1/4"" bit broke cleanly in half, just below the carbide insert. I was milling cherry at a steady feed rate, so I can only blame the bit. Maybe the other sizes will hold up better, but this is my first (and last) set of Grizzly router bits."
2,annoying interviews,"Yes, the music was good... But in between each song is an interview. And some songs are only partial songs. Ozzy seems drunk throughout and seems obcessed with constantly screaming out the ""F"" word. It would have been nice if someone would have labeled the DVD with 'parental guidance suggested'. Ozzy, also moons the crowd to the guitarist's enjoyment. Also, the soundtrack must have been overdubbed, the songs don't always match Ozzy's lips. Maybe Epic could have made a toned down version or alerted the buyer to the obcenity on the DVD."
1,"CHT, PERTH, WESTERN AUSTRALIA","Thanks to Ramon Fonseca Molina for the warning. Beware of Thin Lizzy as well so called 'Live & Dangerous' DVD. Its all about chord changes. Save your hard earn money, guys."
3,"black sabbath as they really are, very good dvd ++++","this is a very good dvd as good as live and loud , its a very good insight into the real black sabbath cheers Geoff"
1,An Audiophile Viewer,"What a terrible production DVD with these interviews interrupted the concert ! Ozzy, Tony..... please for God's sake, get this concert remastered again without interviews and reproduce to the market. A refund for this DVD who purchased ?? A big joke !"
1,"IF YOU WANT A CONCERT VIDEO, AVOID THIS","I caught this tour in Memphis and was looking forward to the video. I picked it up without doing any research. I regret my decision. With the exception of War Pigs, EVERY song on this is interrupted with interview footage."
2,Argh!,"Haven't the DVD producers ever heard of a commentary track or bonus sections? The interviews kill what would've been a great great show. Two stars for the music you do get to see and hear and Geezer is a madman on this disc. Sadly Ozzy is off key in many songs but he's Ozzy so its forgivable.Hopefully the next DVD they make won't be produced with MyDVD and I've learned my lesson of not impulsely buying any concert dvd without checking out these reviews first.Ruined. I'll reiterate what many have said, ""It's a shame""."
3,"Great Concert, less technical options","I'm a fan of Black Sabbath and the concert is really fantastic! But I miss all the options a DVD gives to the viewer! Nearly all songs are interrupted by interviews you can't turn off. I think, there should be released fast a new version, all the abilities of the new medium are included. For all fans it is a MUST to own this one, because Ozzy, Tony, Geezer and Bill are in great form and you dont't know if they will do one more Tour together!"
1,monkey at the controls!!!,"the show starts with an incredible performance of war pigs. unbelievable! everybody - ozzy, geezer, ward and iommi - are in great form!the next song is nib. just when tony iommi breaks into the immortal solo, that's the time these freaks to insert an interview! i was speechless, my heart was in my friggin hand and every known expletive spewing from my mouth - the m*%$#r f#$%^rs ...likewise it is with every song that follows.what must have been a truly great show is ruined in this dvd!this is one of the moments you wish something like the texas chainsaw massacre happened in these stupid music companies!"
2,Disappointing,"Black Sabbath is one of the greatest heavy rock bands of all times, if not the greatest. When I saw this DVD at the music store, I was thrilled to learn that there was a live concert of their reunion so I bought it right away thinking I was going to see a great live concert. It started great but I was quickly disappointed when in the middle of the first song the music died because it was interrupted by interviews of the band members. Why would anyone think it's cool to be listening to a great song and all of a sudden stop the music to hear someone talking? All the interruptions in the middle of the songs ruined the pleasure of anjoying the music. I have to say this is a very disappointing DVD but I still give it 2 stars because I did enjoy the parts where there is no talking."
1,Attention: Producers and Buyers of Concert dvds.,"Dvd concerts are a wonderful way to entertain friends. It doesn't matter if you are watching them on a television set with one speaker or a full blown, dedicated, high end home theater system. However be sure of what you are buying. Read the reviews. The single worst thing a producer can do to an otherwise quality performance like ""The Last Supper"" is to interrupt the show with interviews and such. Extras are wonderful but the appropriate place for them is in the ""extras"" area of the disk NOT in between songs or worst yet in the middle of a song. Too bad for this title..... ""The Last Supper"" Black Sabbath was in peak form and sounded great. If you want a live-like concert experience, buy something else."
3,Great concert but....,"Without a doubt, this the ultimate Black Sabbath concert dvd to own. However there are two things very wrong with this dvd release: Close captioning is mysteriously absent and would have helped considerably during the interview segments. Sadly, there are interviews interrupting the performances. This was really irritating for me as I watched. I would have hoped for a uninterrupted concert and then the interviews at the end. Why this dvd was edited in this manner is unknown but it was clearly the wrong choice. Sound quality and picture are very good and the performances are classic although there are a few songs absent when compared to the 'Reunion' cd."
4,Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,"This is one hell of a show that walks you through the lives of Ozzie,Tony, Gezzer and Bill being on the road and the concerts are brilliant. You American and English fans can think yourselves lucky to see such a great Rock 'N' Roll band, (wish Sabbath would come to the land of OZ (Australia)). The humor between the band when talking of past experiences is first class. I recommend this DVD to any Black Sabbath fan. If there is one draw back its the interruptions of the songs when the band members talk of how the song came about. This small hiccup is eventually over looked when you seat back crank up the volume and drift off with with the Masters of Reality."
2,Great Band- Bad DVD,"Don't expect to enjoy a Black Sabbath concert. Almost every song is interrupted (in most cases at a critical point in the song) by interviews with band members. Why not put the interviews at the end or on a bonus DVD? When you're actually listening to the concert, the band is raging but the interviews (although somewhat interesting and funny) totally ruin the mood. On the positive, Ozzy sounds great, remembers the words, and is into the performances. Unfortunately he reminds me of an elderly person shuffling around looking like he's going to fall on his face at any moment. Borrow it, don't buy it."
2,I thought I was buying a concert film,"Everytime I was getting into a song I was really starting to enjoy, a stupid interview with the band would intrude and ruin the song for me. This happens many, many times and just ruined what would of been a killer concert. When I buy a concert DVD, I want to watch a concert. Put the interviews in the special features!!"
1,Good music,Why do they interrupt the music with interviews? Thats what the special feature function on DVD's are for!John
5,back from hell,"Come on now!. We have all heard these songs before! I admitt it is exciting to hear the original Sabbath playing these tunes again but its just as equally exciting to hear them ""finally"" talking about how these tunes came about! Just revel in both!. Buy the cd if you just want to hear the music for gods sake people!. The interviews are ""not"" an intrusion but a treat!"
1,Disgraceful,"This DVD is a disgrace. Pathetic. It's actually an outstanding film of a Black Sabbath concert, but the producers ruined it by interrupting the songs with interviews... How can the members of Black Sabbath allow the record company to butcher the songs like that? Don't they have enough interest in their own music to pay attention to what gets released? My only hope is that they will release these performances someday in their entirety, but they probably won't... Such a shame that corporations and record labels show such disrespect for music. Black Sabbath is one of the greatest live bands of all time and there isn't very much concert footage that has been released, so why did they have to ruin this wonderful concert?"
1,Thanks,"Thank you all people, i was going to buy this DVD but not anymore... if the songs are cut because of the interview, it's just not worth it."
5,BLACK SABBATH IS GOD,the viedo kicks ***. it is the best mix of liv and behind the stage footage any fan of this killer band could want. i showed it to a friend of mine and made him a sabbath fan. Sabbath Rules
2,Too much fogey footage,"Sorry, no disrespect intended. Black Sabbath Rule! This dvdunfortunately does not.The tracks are performed really well but itstotally ruined, i think, by the songs cutting off half way through andslapped straight to an interview.This was silly.If you dont mindseeing 2 minutes of killer songs like Spiral Architect, or maybe aminute of Iron Man, go ahead. Otherwise, pick up a bootleg from ebay -you'll get more enjoyment out of it!The intereview are pretty lame- nothing that hasnt been said before.Its unfortunate that the onlygood stuff on this dvd is marred by uninteresting, annoying andpointlessly placed interview footage.This should be gathering dustfor the next few years..."
3,Great DVD,"Very good but les talking are more LIVE songs would have been great, they cut off some great live meterial!"
2,Poorly edited.,"One might find it annoying to watch this due to its poor editing, songs were interrupted by interviews, this lousy kind of editing have been previously done in the Black Sabbath Story Vol 2, at least that one was a documentary while this one, The Last Supper, was a concert/live show and the playing should not be interrupted by interviews in the middle of the songs. Anyway I kept this DVD just for my collection."
4,This Needs Re-Released!,"The performance is great, but they should NOT interrupt the concert with the interviews! They could have easily put them as a separate option to watch apart from the concert itself! That and they blended footage from 6 concerts together, which you begin to wonder how Ozzy can throw 3 buckets of water on the crowd, wearing 3 different outfits, in the span of 30 seconds."
4,"Do over, PLEASE!","I've had this DVD since it came out and haven't watched it in years. I just pulled it back out and remembered why. I am reading through all these other reviews and everyone says the same thing. The interview interruptions are unforgivable. Don't get me wrong, I love a good documentary and I will watch one about a band I don't even like, like Nirvana, just to learn the history and hear the characters tell their stories. This could have been a magnificent DVD if they had allowed all the songs to play though uninterrupted and save all the interviews for in between or a separate disc. It's great to hear Bill tell the story of the opium-induced title for NIB, BUT NOT DURING THE SONG. If anyone who has anything to do with Sabbath (SHARON!!!) is reading this, please go back to the drawing board and do this video right. Also, why 1999? Isn't there footage from the TRUE 1997 Reunion shows???"
1,They were great concerts...BUT,"The concerts were really great. Black Sabbath was in top form. Ozzy's vocals fantastic. The interviews were interesting and funny. But whom ever put the DVD together really screwed it up bad. You see and hear the beginning of a song then it changes to an interview, goes back for the ending of the song then does the same in EVERY SINGLE SONG!!! It would have been great if they had the concert by its self and the interviews either before or after it. Or seperate as a special feature. Then I would have given it 5 stars. As it is my advice is don't bother it's not worth the money."
3,Black Sabbath - The Last supper,"What were they thinking , when they put an interview right in the middle of some the songs ! If that did not happen I would give this DVD a 5 star rating . The sound is a 5 star. I hope they come out with some more of the original member BLack Sabbath concerts recorded in 5.1 dolby digital ."
2,Concert or interview?,"I was happy when this DVD has been published and happier when I bought it. Arriving home, my first moves have been: switch on Tv, Amplifier, DVD player and Subwoofer. I sit on the sofa, at the center of a 5+1 speakers crossfire and the concert starts with War Pigs....I raise the volume and enjoy the Sabbath classic sound, at last! The magic ends when, in the middle of the song, a (brief, but breaking) interview starts. I think that such an important reunion has an interesting background, so I listen to the interview. The next song starts, interrupted by another spoken insert. So, I adjust the volume and explore the DVD: every song is mutilated by interviews! Why inserting them in the live songs? DVD carry a huge information amount: there is room for hours and hours of footage....I would have surely watched a full interview, after watching the concert. This DVD is, in my opinion, really disappointing! Sergio"
2,Black Sabbath Interrupted,"The only thing about this DVD that really bums me out, is that the interviews are in the middle of the songs. I think to be able to enjoy a live concert, the songs should not be interrupted by interviews and stuff that should be in the special features part of the DVD.I hope if they release another live DVD, the concert will be the main focus."
4,A Movie with a Heart,"This film was one which worked purely on emotional levels. Matt Dillon and Joan Chen give fine performances as individuals whose cultures' although widely different bring them together in a poignant but tragic way. Although the film tries to cover a large segment of time and simplifies the conflicts exhibited by the 50's and 70's from the cold war to the peace generation it does not lose track with its focus upon how events impact human relationships. Conscience, guilt, love, ambition, and redemption of the human spirit are sensitively embodied in this film. Sounds ""corny"", but it works. The entire cast does a fine job and the music score by Elliot Goldenthal is beautiful to hear. Bring a hankerchief. This is a film with a heart."
2,"Works okay, but comes apart","I just bought this with my new Cingular phone. I was pretty pleased with it...until I had to charge it. The second or third time I disconnected the charging cord, it pulled off the entire top of the unit and exposed the underlying electronics. I stuck the piece back on, but it now comes off EVERY time I disconnect the charger. I'll be taking this back for a refund or replacement."
1,Buyer beware- Sorry!,"In all honesty, I have been very dissatisfied with my Aliph jawbone. I work in a nightclub and invested in the Jawbone in hopes of the claims of noise reduction being true. I tested it in my car, with moderate stereo volume in the background. There was no reduction in the background noise level with the Jawbone noise reduction on or off. The only difference I noted was a slight improvement in the clarity of my voice. I thought I had a defective one. The same night, I talked to one of our doormen who also had one, but keeps it in his pocket, due to his dissatisfaction with it. Buyers beware, you may be victims of one the best orchestrated scams I have ever seen. [...]. Until then, all I can say is the product DOES NOT reduce background noise, unless maybe you are using very sensitive measuring equipment than can measure DB fractions. Sorry Aliph, thus far it looks like you took this risk and now your busted."
4,Their First and a Pretty Good One!,"This album first got me aquainted with the duo from San Diego. The tracks, ""Africa"" and the haunting tune ""Traveling"" are the best things about the CD. Though it's not as good as their future recordings, it's still worth listening to. Long out of print, it would be a bargain if you can find it on the cheap."
5,Revisiting an old friend,"The production values of the American Grammaphone company were put to the test by this very talented pair of musicians. Each composition evokes a different emotional response - all of them warm and compassionate. Checkfield is aural candy to my ears. I have had these songs on cassette tape for years, but wanted them on the media they sound best on - CD! Glad I found this on Amazon."
2,A disappointment,"I had an old headset made by Anycom but the somewhat bulky earpiece made it very uncomfortable for wearing it for a long time. After I saw this IOGear it looks more attractive so I bought it.The more I use it, the more I dislike it. The ear hook is too flimsy that it is not holding it in place. Whenever I move my head, the whole earpiece moves away from my face. It did not fall down completely from my ear, just hanging there with the piece pointing 45 degrees from my face!More importantly, it frequently connects/disconnects while in standby mode, sometimes several times a minute. This is very annoying because your ear is filled with the ding-dong's (it chimes when it connects or disconnects) all the time. Sometimes when you want to take a phone call you'd find out that your headset is not connected!I've returned it once and got a replacement, but the replacement has the same problem. I hope I can get my money back."
2,WORTH THE PRICE,The headset seems to have a lot of static sounds in the backround issues.Don't conform to ear or around ear very easily or securely. Always feels as if it is going to fall off your ear.Reason being the price was very inexpensive. If you can deal with the above issues and not be bothered by them then this item is for you.
2,not worth it,"i have used over 4 different bluetooth headsets with my Razr V3, and i can say unequivocally this headset is definitely NOT worth the price.PROS--fits well and is comfortable for long wear--my friends say that they hear me well and they don't hear an echoCONS--staticy even when i'm only 2-3 feet away--the pairing with my Razr is maddeningly annoying: when it is on standby and connected to my phone, it keeps connecting-disconnecting- connecting-disconnecting every 20-60 seconds. aghh! some of my other headsets do this too, but NOWHERE as frequently. the strange thing is that it doesn't disconnect when i'm actually using headset talking to someone... only when it's standing byi recommend for this price either the Cardo Systems SCALA 500, and for a little bit more: samsung WEP200. both of which have better sound quality, almost no static, and no connection problems."
3,It still gets hot,I puchased this to used with the lodge dutch oven. I cut it in half so I could put one on each handle but it didn't help. The wrap gets very hot during cooking so I can't pick up the pot so it doesn't help. It might work better if you wrap it around a pan handle like the picture but if you want it for the same purpose as me then forget about it.
3,"Good Words, Bad Form","The vocab in this book is very appropriate for a low scorer who must raise their score, but if you are a high scorer you will be unimpressed by most of the words. I ended taking out about 5 words from each of the 30+ lessons and making my own word lists, not to say that those words didn't help me. My score rose 70 points, but I also made my own word lists and flash card using words from here and 10 Real SATs.The exercises are awful. The other words in the analogies are more diffcult than the vocab. I ended up ignoring all of them.If you are looking for a quick way to study for the SAT vocab, then buy flashcards. In the end that was the most useful format."
4,Great book,"I think this is a great book for increasing vocabulary. Grouping similar words together helped me to retain more definitions. Although, I wish it had more detailed definitions to illustrate the different connotations of similar words. ""Choose the Right Word"" by Hayakawa really helped me to learn the connotations of words. And thanks Amazon for your customers also bought recommendations which makes it much easier to find whatever I'm looking for."
1,Don't even think about it,A leading consumer organization tested this model. All five units they tested were defective! Other Haier models have received poor grades from Amazon reviewers. Need I say more?
4,Great but it could be more visual,"I really liked the simplicity of the book but I wish that it showed some visual references to explain the ideas more clearly. I am an educator as well and I have found students like to see examples especially when they are trying to learn to be visual thinkers. The author did not define logo in his book. Why not? The colors chosen for this book are too close in value and when printed next to each other made it very difficult on the eyes. It is so bad in some areas (example: see Unity) that it seemed as though the printer purposely did not trap the colors (orange type in a grey field) because the reader could not of read the type. The typeface that was chosen for the main text was very difficult to read - Design Language missed the mark on legibility in some parts of the book. In fact, the author did not even define legibility within the book - it may of helped the designer who laid out the book."
5,Concise,Tim McCreight's Design Language provides concise definitions for terms used in the arts. I have found it helpful in my introduction to art concepts class.
3,Who fell asleep during the design process?,"Basically, this book is just plain tough to read. The contrast of typeface color over the page color is ""arty"" but totally impractical for easy reading. Interesting concept for a book, though, and some good ideas. Still, I put it into the tag sale pile for spriing clean-up, if you're interested. Toobaad since i like all of his other work."
4,Nice case if you carry your phone in your pocket.,"I work in construction and always carry my phone in my left front pocket to protect it from, well, construction stuff! This case works perfectly because it has no 'clip' of any kind protruding from the back of the case. The case slides easily in and out of a front pocket. The case is metal with hard rubber around the periphery. It is nice looking and the fit and finish is very good. I've dropped my phone twice on concrete surfaces since installing this case and my phone received (pardon the pun) no damage. The only negative is the case won't allow full insertion of your charger in the mini port. While it allows enough of it in to make contact, it's a bit of an annoyance. Other than that, I highly recommend this case, especially for the price."
2,Sharp edges and fingerprints marks,"Product has sharp edges, makes me want to file it on a rock! Stainless Steel central part is SUPER prone to fingerprints marks so the phone always looks like it dirty, horrible! I was looking for a sleek look and this is not it.Pro: fits very well on phone leaving space for camera and charger, easy to snap on."
4,doing the job,"bought it, put it on, done. thats it it protects my phone it has already hit the the ground no problem it does its job"
3,Metalocalypse does pirate songs...,"If you're looking at this as a suggestion from Alestorm, you'll be disappointed. Sounds more like the Adult Swim's Metalocalypse than anything else. Music is great, singer leaves something to be desired. I gave this away to a friend who likes Metalocalypse."
2,"With a Better Vocalist, Maybe...","I've been a classic-thrash fan since the 80s... SWASHBUCKLE should not be compared with the likes of early ANTHRAX or EXODUS. They DON'T sound like them at all! While the music is ok, there's nothing catchy or special about any of the tracks. And then there's the vocalist... Just horrible! He sounds like he wants to be in a death metal band, not thrashing. Can't understand a SINGLE word he roars and he's never on key. Just crap on his part... This CD is headed straight to trade-in at my local music store...If you're looking for some good, new thrash bands, SWASHBUCKLE isn't one of them. Check out FUELED BY FIRE, MERCILESS DEATH, AVENGER OF BLOOD or WARBRINGER for a start. They won't let you down."
1,Glorified Tour of Taleisin,"This video is horrible. Has nothing to do with get ready to cross ocean, but more with all the neat things that Lin & Larry did in building Taleisin. If you are a modern day cruiser, this video really doesn't apply. If you have the same boat as Larry, then.. maybe.. that is.. if you can make through the horrible production quality, dry monologues and really really basic and boring content."
1,Not worth it,I bought this overpriced ($21) arm band to help in my tennis elbow treatment. It is uncomfortable and did not really provide relief or support. The velcro wears away quickly and after a few weeks will not hold. Also the gel pack never gets cold. I put it in my freezer overnight and the next day wore it with no effect. Go with a different brand like the McDavid tennis elbow band. It only costs about $10 and doesn't have the worthless gel pack. It does have a comfortable foam band under the velcro. It also seems to last longer.
1,Andy H,There was no issues with shipping or receiving the product. I wore the product for 4 weeks and have come to the conclusion that it does not work in relieving pain.
2,Graphics too bizarre,Looks like it was made in someone's house - not preofessionally done -- I think it's a little creepy the way the characters look and act -- definitely wish I did not purchase this -- but it seems to keep my 3 year olds attention.
5,Best of the Series,"The Great Philosophers series is generally a mixed bag of accessible and inaccessible or dry material. Their treatment of Ayer is the most engaging and thought provoking of the series, most likely because his Logical Positivist philosophy is not nearly as obtuse as say Bertrand Russell's mathmatical conundrums. This book is highly recommended to both students and casual readers."
5,Great tenor voice,"Not only is he a great singer, but who he choses to play with makes this a great cd. Buy it , you will enjoy it!"
5,Awesome,"My late husband introduced me to Checkfield many years ago and I treasure the two CD's I own: A View from the Edge and Distant Thunder.Whenever I'm feeling the effects of stress or can't sleep I put on A View from the Edge and all my troubles just seem to float away on the wings of the music. I feel relaxed, rejuvenated, free as a bird. Listening to A View from the Edge is almost a religious experience for me!Hitchhiker is one of my favorites. It makes me think of California and driving up the Pacific Coast Highway--I don't know why, since I live in Indianapolis.To Look for America is so sweet it's almost painful--it never fails to bring tears to my eyes.This CD passes the litmus test I assign to all music: it takes me away from myself, my time, and my place on the earth. It delivers me to another plane altogether."
4,Works well,"This products works as advertised. It scans and prints well. The software works, the interface is clear, you don't have to fool around trying to figure it out. Everything works just the way you would expect it to.Great product!"
3,Cartridge problems.,"Have had printer for 6 months - works fine except that it makes a lot of weird noises - seems a little clunky compared to my old HP. When the ink ran out, I tried to replace the 3 color cartridges - one worked, the other 2 would not light up, no matter what I did. I e-mailed Canon, and (after insisting on knowing the serial number, and my phone number (why?)) they agreed to send me new cartridges. We'll see what happens. At the moment, I cannot print anything. Cartridges that are THAT expensive ought to work."
3,NICE PRINTER BUT ONE BOTHERSOME FLAW ...,"I recently bought this printer from Amazon, generally like it, but it has one problem: when I have not used printer for a time (1 - 7 days, this problem more likely & severe the longer it has been) colors are often very bad, eg no red at all, sometimes no red and no yellow, on first page or 2 that I print. After 1-2 pages everything works fine until printer is unused for another few-day period. This problem always leaves me the choice of reprinting 1 or 2 pages (spending precious time and draining expensive ink) or accepting a lousy looking printout. Note there may be a fix out there, I am too lazy/busy to hunt it down. And if you are running this printer long and hard, on a daily basis, you will probably not experience this problem. But if you use printer only for small and occasional jobs (say a 4 page job 3 times a week) I think this printer is a bad choice, you can probably get more dependable quality from a less expensive printer."
2,Is not a great photo printer,"My first pictures out of this printer were disappointing. I could see grain in the darker areas of faces, which actually turned out to be ink pooling. (The problem was not my camera.) I posted a question about it in an online forum for advice and was told to use only Canon paper. No Kodak, HP or anything else that I had been using. I noticed only minimal improvement with Canon paper. Photos are still not to my satisfaction. I tried changing every possible printer setting imaginable. No improvement. Cleaned the printer and no improvement. I'm pretty disgusted with it. Based on everyone's reviews, I expected it to produce pictures similar in quality to any photo processing center. Not the case. I haven't used this printer for anything else, so I cannot comment on it's other capabilities. But for those of you thinking about using it primarily for photos, I would definitely recommend against it."
5,Very Well Pleased !!!,"First of all, I want to GIVE KUDOS to AMAZON; BUY from them, and them ONLY -- if it at all possible! I had (2) issues with the order, which included other items: (1) minor, and (1) major -- They RESOLVED them both, essentially in ONE CALL each (+ (1) folllow-up call)!Now, for the MP500 Printer: I just installed, and started using this printer two days ago, however I am already THRILLED with its' performance (and I am very demanding, in regards to quality for my money). Also, VERY important is that I called Tech Support from Canon, to get some quick assistance in completing two tasks. They were GREAT in helping me, and even WANTED to walk me through both of my questions: step by step!!! Thirdly, make sure you get the BELKIN PRO Series USB Cable (10 ft.) for about $3.50 w/your Printer."
2,Does not meet expectations,"Enticed by a rebate, the looks, and the ostensible functions of this printer I bought it. For those thinking of buying, a few notes:-Does not print envelopes-Picture print quality is low (Color)-Does not scan wirelessly (what's the point of having some features wireless and other wired? why have wireless capability at all?)-Copying is comparativly slow-Not Adobe (photoshop) friendly"
4,Great printer,"I purchased this printer and when I started printing my photos with Photoshop, I had really bad quality prints. I thought my printer was defected. So I return it in exchange for another one. When the print quality was the same, I called tech support to see what was going on. It turns out that I needed to use the program that comes with the printer in order to make photo quality printing. After using the software, my prints were identical if not better than the original. My only gripe is not being able to use other softwares to print good quality."
5,Wow,"Everything that I wanted in an all-in-one! Can do everything I need to do with one piece of equipment on the desk, and what a price! The print quality is great and functions beautifully out of the box. Very satisfied with the purchase - fast delivery. What more can one ask?"
3,Not Switchable,"The printer works fine, but connectivity is a problem. I have a rotary-type A/B switch I use to switch my printer between two PCs. This setup worked fine with my Epson CX5200, but it won't work with my new MP500. Customer support told me this printer doesn't support using a selector switch. I also found out that this printer can't be used with a print server. Print servers only support printing and will not support the scanning function on multifunction printers like the MP500. Why doesn't the product literature mention these basic limitations?"
1,Worst Printer Ever!!,"I absolutely detest this printer. The idea is nice, but the machine is horrible. The first one broke after 2 weeks and we got a warranty replacement. The warranty replacement has issues with the ink catridges sometimes not being read by the machine. It is very difficult to use, so confusing. And the online help is worthless. I will NEVER buy another Canon product. They used to be a good company, but no longer."
5,Move over Epson!,"I bought this printer after much research and going through 3 Epson printers. I liked Epson because of the print quality but hated that famous 'change the ink and it dies' problem. So after going through 3 Epson printers all dead from the same problem I thought there must be a better way!. This thing is just AWESOME. It prints, scans, copies, and even to my surprise it even has a slot for my memory card from my digital camera. Print quality is EXCELLENT, it doesn't drink ink, and ink is much cheaper than Epson. I LOVE this printer! Thank you Canon for restoring my faith!"
3,Very Good Deal!,"I recently purchased this printer, and so far have been very impressed with it. The print quality is incredible, in particular photo printing is outstanding. I would have given it five stars, but the included screen doesn't do pictures justice. If you are trying to edit them with the printer alone, it can be a bit difficult. It is still a handy function, as is the printers' ability to serve as a memory card reader for older computers. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good all-in-one printer."
5,Canon MP 500 all in one,"Setting up the printer and figuring out the paper trays was not exactly intuitive, but the effort paid off!! I was very skeptical as to whether or not the colors would be as good as my HP, but they were beautiful. The scanner works great. I also read the printer only printed great pics on the Canon photo paper, but I purchased Kodak premium paper (on sale) and received the same results. The printer prints very quickly and the copier is great too! I got the printer for $119.00 which retails for $199 at other stores. Great multifunction item. So far very pleased with performance."
1,Junk,I bought this unit in April of 2006. It stopped working in four months and Canon only will send you a used unit to replace it. It has to break in 30 days to get a NEW replacement. Don't be fooled by the hype. Its the Warrenty that counts. J.P. Romeo
3,No banner printing,"This printer does not support banner printing, so if your kids need a banner for a school project, you cannot do that.According to the tech support, there is no plans to include this feature in the future versions of the driver. This is a real disappointment, because banner printing is a common feature of many inkjets, and banner paper for inkjets is sold everywhere."
3,Slow Printing,"Very good on photo work and copying but very slow on printing with occasional ink color errors so if you do a lot of printing from Word, MS Works Processing etc. you might do better to buy a Canon printer."
2,Piece of Crap,This Canon MP 500 all in one has terible software. When the print is set for 8 X 10 it prints 7.1 X 9. I can not print my panoramic shots because the largest size paper I can use is 8.5 X 23.3. I have to take them to my friend with a $99 Epson to get a 8.5 X 36 print I have wasted 20 sheets of photo paper trying to get a copy of a 8 X 10 to frame for my Parents anniversary. Finally had to get a frame for a 7 X 9. At times I can also hear my dad swaring on the printer. I think this one will go in the garbage and be replaced with a Epson.
3,Not satisfied,"I was extremely happy to buy this and test it out since it was highly recommended. It is my first canon however.I found i had alot to do to set it up, with alignin printer heads n ink catridges n all dat but wasnt a problem. I 1st test the copier which did so well the scanner was ok aswell. Now the printing i must say i am exxxtrrreeeeemmmmmly disappointed with. I immediately loaded up an image to print in standard quality,only to find a grainy print out where i couldnt see the persons face. i then went on high, and met the same results, the image was only darker. my old HP photo printer, without doubt puts this to shame on its normal quality...not even high. ooooh the grainyness. I do hoever like the lcd, and the easy adjustment options. but the print quality is a horror. I would have to switch between printers for printing images."
3,good when works,"The printer is great when it works. Photos and text all look very nice. Text is on par with a twice more expensive HP AIO, and photos are actually better. However, mine borked on its third set of genuine cartridges, deciding to stop recognizing the blue cartridge, requiring a restart. Bothering with the warranty is not worth it because shipping would cost more than the thing itself - to the garbage it goes....Others must have had a better luck with this machine. As for me, I am paying extra to go to another brand."
2,"OK, but unnecessarily complex","This device performs ok, but it is unnecessarily complex to operate. When coping it inexplicably often reset itself to an odd paper size and type, and you must struggle through the menu to set it to the 8.5 by 11 plain paper size most of us usually use. It has two paper feeds and if you don't need to keep two types of paper stored in the machine, this is just another setting to get wrong when printing. I would look for a simpler user interface if I was buying again."
4,Canon Piwma MP500,"I truly like this printer. The only fault I find with it after about two months use is that sometimes it takes the machine too long to get in gear and begin printing. But the speed and quality are great.Len Kramer, WA"
4,Love the printer,"I bought the Pixma MP500 last October and was disappointed in it. I called Canon directly and explained the problems I was having. After putting the printer through all kinds of tests, the technician agreed that the printer was faulty and they immediately sent a brand new one. I have been very happy with the new one. It prints and scans perfectly and does a good job with pictures."
5,"Great for Mac, Long Life","Mac users: This works painlessly with Tiger. Even the scanning software works well. You won't get that from most other companies.Everyone: One of the best features is that the print nozzles can be replaced, and there's a dust cover when not in use. All ink jet printers clog really easily if exposed to dust, giving white streaks across the printout. The built in dust cover (the paper door flips up to cover the opening) has prevented this from happening even in a fairly dusty environment. Even better, if it ever *does* clog up, the ink jet nozzles are attached to a replaceable snap-in platform, so the printer can be restored in no time at all. Most other ink jet printers have permanent nozzles, or the nozzles are replaced with every single ink cartridge making the cartridges way more expensive."
5,Awesome,"Uses very little ink. Ive printed over 60 sheets of half color and half black birthday cards and several 8X10 full color prints on the highest print quality setting and have not seen the ink levels change. The color photograph prints are stunning. It definitely out does my old epson color c84. And it prints them faster than any color printer I have ever seen. My old epson took around 15 to 20 minutes to print something that this printer will print in under 2 minutes. Haven't used the copy function yet but the printer quality is much more than I expected. Canon has done a great job.And by the way I am a very picky person about everything, so if it impressed me, it will impress you."
3,Ugh... it's a great printer but the errors are killing me...,So I've seen a few people on Amazon have the same problem. The printer will throw an error because it thinks that there are more than one of the same color ink tanks installed when there are not. The only solution is to pull the plug on the printer and hope you can get your job out when you plug it back in.Cannon customer support has been VERY responsive though. So Kudos to them. However the solution is for them to send me a new ink tank. The only problem now is that stupid ink tank is on BACKORDER! ahh! (as of 11-9-06)... I wonder if that's because so many of the same ink tank are throwing an error? Sounds like the ink tanks are defective...Anyway... the printer is slick and the quality is nice.. just wish it worked more consistently.
2,NOT the ORIGINAL!,"Apparently the ORIGINAL Twix Peanut Butter (PB) bar has been discontinued and was replaced with this inferior version (I guess at least a couple of years ago). Wish I had known that before ordering these bars! Yet another perfectly GOOD product needlessly messed up by the manufacturer! This version has a dark chocolate cookie, which I guess is okay; but it does not taste near as good to my tastebuds as the original PB bar with the standard cookie! I guess I will have to look for something else the next time I get a peanut butter candy/cookie urge that needs satisfying. Again, for whatever reasons, companies just can never seem to leave well enough alone, go figure?"
5,A ball,"Excellent and humorous story of Tibetan Buddhist monks obtaining a satellite disk in order to watch the 1998 Soccer World Cup. Based on real people and events, with Tibetan refugees playing the parts. Wonderful to watch.Spoken in Tibetan with English subtitles."
5,Lovely Captivating Film but has screen format problem,"I can't say much more than others about this wonderful film. A little overacting by the children perhaps but otherwise it is charming and will make you smile. Since the price is a little high for my usual DVD purchase I bought this through the Amazon Marketplace. I am disappointed in the screen width, although it is advertised as Widescreen and Enhanced for 16x9 TVs, what appears is a small widescreen, it does NOT fill the whole screen. If I zoom in with my set, the subtitles get chopped off. It's not a major problem but I don't think anyone else has mentioned it. There may be several versions out there and I guess i got this format."
5,I'd give it 10 stars if I could!,"I cannot reccommend The Cup too highly! It is a DVD to be watched over and over. Peaceful and with a deceptively 'ordinary' plot, I found it very suspenseful on first viewing. It abounds with quiet humour but it never lacks tension. The ""actors"" are all to be congratulated, as is Khyentse Norbu himself. May he make many more movies!"
2,Everybody loves the world's sport--soccer,"This is a sweet film, quiet and inoffensive. The boy reminds me of the Artful Dodger, and more than once I thought of Dickens' Fagin as I watched young Buddhist monks going about their lives under the tutelege of an old man. This is an unfamiliar world where boys grow up in a place of contemplation, yet they are energetic boys. Tibetan (or Bhutanese) teens have a hard time adjusting to being monks. What better outlet for their energies than a passion for soccer? This is no ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" a wonderfully funny family film, but it's a pleasant and poignant little look into a foreign culture."
3,Tibetan realities,"Also moviemakers push a FREE TIBET idea wherever they can in this funny work of a modern Tibetan Buddhist school, the most one understood was a significant change in mentality of youth preferred satellite TV and world football championship to all stories their parents paid monks to teach their kids of.Not explicitly sexy asSamsara [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.4 Import - Australia], but educative and broadening knowledge of cultural issues and Tibetan realities."
4,go pack go!,"shipped and arrived on time. great size, perfect fit, and always the talk of the venue when i'm wearing it out to view a game."
1,Order carefully,"When I purchased the iRobot Dirt Dog Workshop Robot, this cleaning solution was recommended as a product to use with the Dirt Dog. However, the Dirt Dog doesn't have a cleaning option so this solution was a wasted purchase. Be careful when ordering recommended products!"
4,Works fine but white vinegar is just as good,"This product works well. The iScooba it is meant to work with is excellent. However, we've taken to using white vinegar in the iScooba because it is more cost effective, does as good a job, and does not void the iScooba warranty."
1,Do not buy here - way too expensive!,49.99 for a bottle of cleaning fluid is crazy. This originally retailed at 3.99 at roomba 1 year ago.I SPRAY PINE SOL WITH WATER OUT OF A SPRAYER onto the floor AND let the roomba suck it upMUCH CHEAPER!
1,OVERPRICED!!!,"From all the reviews, I thought I was getting a pack of cleaning bottles for $50. Nope. Just one.It's effective, but there have to be cheaper options!"
1,Buyer Be Aware,"This product from this vendor is way overpriced. For $50.00, I thought I was purchasing 6 bottles of the cleaner because I have purchased it from other sites at about that price. To my surprise only one bottle was shipped. Check IRobot directly and you will find it much more reasonably priced. $50.00 per bottle is ridiculous. I won't be buying anything from this site again.Granted, I's my own fault, but they should make it clear the price is for one bottle.Bob FPhoenix"
1,stuff is great but very very very over priced,These people bought it at $8.00 a bottle and now they are selling it at $50. a bottle. It's a great product but not that great. Save your money.
1,Rip Off,I bought this product thinking that I was getting 9 bottles of solution. It doesn't say in the product description how many but in the first review it says that IRobot has 9 bottles for $39.99. Therefore I assumes that I would be getting 9 bottles. Imagine my surprise when just 1 bottle showed up.
1,Helpful hint! Buy something like this instead...,Hopefully the beware of rip-off reviews will short circuit any other victims to this seller.Try something like this instead - it works for me. Get a non-soap based hospital grade cleaner like this:http://www.amazon.com/Citrus-Hospital-Germicidal-Deodorizing-Cleaner/dp/B0002XIYVC/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1297451746&sr;=1-2There are other non-soap based hospital cleaners out there that will work as well at keeping the Scooba from slipping. There's no reason to buy any cleaner from this individual or iRobot for that matter.I use the same amt of hospital cleaner in the Scooba as this Clorox cleaner. Floors stay clean. Hope this helps!
1,Is the price for 1 - 32oz bottle correct? Any idea when the 5 bottle deal is coming back?,"Just received my iRobot Scooba 330 today, I was wondering if anyone else has found that finding the Clorox Scooba cleaning solution very troublesome to purchase? I am unable to find it anywhere, either locally or online... The only place I am able to find is here on Amazon, and Amazaon wants to sell it for $50.00 for a 32oz. bottle. Just doesn't seem right about that price. If anyone can post any sites of where it can be bought at, I would greatly appreciate it. I believe the 5 bottle deal would be very cost efficient. I just don't want to have to use white vinegar and have my kitchen smelling like salad dressing. Did perhaps Clorox discontinue this brand? Help!"
1,Idiotic price,"Not sure what is more idiotic, the person that would price this for ONE BOTTLE, or any idiot that would pay this price. They don't make this anymore and this company probably doesn't have it."
1,Not all that,"Does not clean that well (leaves a film, streaky). Vinegar, which iRobot also recommends, works great for a fraction of the price. The vinegar smell evaporates in several minutes plus it's all natural.iRobot used to sell this Clorox solution for $4.33 a bottle including S&H.; Plus, what you're buying now is (years) old stock that has been discontinued."
5,"Great Product, Smells Good and Cleans without Streaks!","This cleaning solution is great. Before my Scooba, I was on the hunt for a product that would clean my floors without (literally) giving me a headache and without leaving streaks. I tried countless brands and spent lots of money. Many, many products gave me headaches, I'm not sure if it was the tons of fragrance or the chemicals overall. Also, many of them also left my laminate and marble floors with visible streaks. It drove me crazy! The Scooba cleaning solution has a very mild scent and doesn't leave streaks on my floors. It may seem pricey, I get about 20+ uses per bottle. (I don't always need to use the full 1.5 oz per use, I use about half of that when cleaning my smaller rooms.)Having said all of this, the Scooba doesn't HAVE to take this solution, it could take plain white vinegar as well.Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, if you shop around you could possibly find it for a lower price."
4,Does it's job as advertised.,"This soap works well in the Roomba Scooba, and works far better than plain vinegar, which the documentation for the Roomba Scooba says is an option. This provides a good smell and leaves a great sheen on linolium. I can't say it makes wood shine, but my wood also needs polished.Using plain water in the Scooba will leave you with a scooba that has no traction and will constantly tell you it is stuck.The only reason this is 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish it was more concentrated, came in a smaller bottle and required less solution per cycle."
2,overpriced,"This is a super product that works well with my scooba. I can purchase the same item for $6.99 at many other sites on the web, I mean why pay $49.99 if you don't have to. This was a real letdown for me as far as Amazon 's pricing goes."
3,Expensive and for a rather useless product,"Smells nice, cleans well in the Scooba, but my remanufactured scooba started to leave my hardwood wetter than I was comfortable with after 3 runs, so it's going back (as soon as I get AllergyBeGone to issue an RA number, not such a trivial task it seems)."
3,Get it at the local grocery store!!!,"The scooba works great. I order this product but the product was placed on backorder.I had a party coming up and had to use the Scooba (as I'm lazy cleaning person), so I went to Safeway and found a Clorox floor cleaning product that looked identical to this product, except 'Scooba' wasn't on the label. The instructions indicated I should use aprox 1/2 the amount of the Scooba product. It worked like Clorox 'Scooba' but didn't smell as nice as Clorox 'Scooba'. It costed $2.99 (reg price). I'll try to cancel the back-order. Now, I wished I checked the grocery isles before logging into amazon."
3,NOT AT HIS BEST,"I am a big fan of William Joyce's work. He has such a wonderful style and tells such great, imaginative stories. This early work from him isn't one of my favorites though. It's a cute story, but the illustrations, the true stars of his books, are a bit different than what he normally does. The illustrations are too light or something. Still the character desings are cute and it's well worth the price of purchase but it's just not as satisfying as his other works."
2,heavily edited,"This CD must have been heavily edited.I bought it last year and thought this new performer was a very accomplished one. However, motivated by the CD I went recently to a concert presented by the Bonk Festival in Tampa area where I live and was extremely dissapointed with the performance of Sergio Barroso's Viola Desnuda. Neither the wonderful sound nor technical mastery found on the CD was evident in the live performance given by Ms. Wilcox. Day and night!It is very frustrating these days that ""performers"" can simulate high artistic levels with the aid of master editors. (In this case it seems to have been the composer himself).One never knows.Based on this experience I assume the other works on this CD went through the same grand editing process."
3,Beyond Elvis' Memphis,"I loved the Magical History Tour dvd and I was looking forward to this dvd. This dvd was ok. It didn't show as many places as the other dvd and while the interviews were nice to listen to, I probably couldn't watch them more than once. It's still a nice dvd to have for Elvis fans, but I preferred the Magical History dvd."
1,Very sad indeed...,"A friend of mine recommended this book to me because she knows I love erotic fiction with interesting twists. Unfortunately, for all Kate Douglas' skills as a writer, ""Wolf Tales"" falls far short of the glowing Five star reviews it seems to be garnering here.The characters are cold and very difficult to identify with. Sex scenes without good characters are a chore to sit through, and some of the descriptive phrases used were *not* sexy at all."
3,wow,I still haven't finished this one but it seems... well... pretty good its very racey for my taste I think lol
1,So wrong,"Do not buy this book! A lot of people say they thought it was sexy but it was just nasty. After they described his ""member"" as looking like a dogs that was it! I like books with sex senes but these were sooo weird and not in a good way at all. I wish I didn't buy the book it was a waste of money."
3,Expected More ...,"I believe you can pick up any of these books and not have to read any previous ones in the series to understand what is going on. I have only read book 1 and am currently reading book 2. So far, it appears to be very similiar to book 1. The connection between characters was ok and found it a bit hard to believe how quickly Keisha trusted after what she'd been through. Great that the girls could support each other and the guys were gentle and slow...when needed. This book just didn't keep my undivided attention or the desire to keep reading and not put it down. The anticipation of what was next didn't exist. I decided to read book 2 to see if the writing gets better or continues along the same lines.I would not highly recommend this book, but would suggest giving it a read if all your ""must reads"" have been read."
2,Stupid storyline,"I love erotic books but this book was awful. The storyline was ridiculous i mean it was actually laughable. I hated the names of the characters and i didn't like any of them. The sexual interludes were o.k. in the beginning of the book but then they became really cheesy. In fact the whole book was just so cheesy. Don't waste your time. There are plenty of other erotic books to read, skip this one."
5,delivers all the title promises... and more,"This addition of Wolf Tales delivers all the title promises -- hot shifter sex, steamy erotica, and a complex plot. Interwoven and deeply intertwined with the ancient Werewolf legends, this tale attempts to find the logic behind the mystery. It's enough to make you believe werewolves really did -- and do -- exist. But the creatures Kate Douglas brings us are far, far sexier than those of legend -- though just as deadly if you cross them. And did I mention HOT? M/F, M/M, ménage, and more. Kate Douglas holds nothing back -- prepare to have your fingers scorched -- amazing the pages didn't burst into flame. If you enjoy erotica, don't miss Wolf Tales. A romp in the park will never look quite the same again."
5,"And can I just say one word ""FIRE!""","Kate Douglas sets the reader on Fire (the kind you need a cold shower for) with Wolf Tales. It's not for vanilla tastes, but if you read this book, I can almost guarantee your partner, spouse, lover, etc, will be begging you to read it again. This one is a total keeper, and Kate Douglas is fast becoming one of my favs. I will be keeping an eye out for more books from this author."
5,Wolf Tales,Kate Douglas has outdone herself with this novel. A beautifully crafted tale that that will keep you warm on these cold nights. I strongly recommend this read to other lovers of erotic romance.
1,OH?,"This book is just a little too much for me. It really does border on bestiality in my view. If I remember correctly there is also a couple of M/M scenes which can be okay if written well but put the two together and it was just to much, YUCK!"
3,Should have been better,The first half of the book was quite good. Then it just sort of dulled out. It's sad to say that this story actually bored me after such a nice start. Read the first half and then don't hold your breath because it may easily disappoint you too.
5,wolf tales,"I think to this day that the first Wolf Tales will always be my favorite. When Xandi slides off the road and is sure she will die, she is rescued by an unknown saviour. She wakens in his arms in one of the hottest love scenes I have ever read in my life. I really thought the book would spontaneously combust on me.When she discovers Stephen's true personage she doesn't turn her back on him but begins the road to the true love of her life. We also meet Antoine and Keisha as well as he helps her heal from the brutality of man.Like i said it's my favorite of the series,but then I have yet to read wolf tales VII. I can't wait."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I like a weird and unique werewolf novel, and while this definitely fit the weird bill, the incredible lack of plot and explanation was too much for me to handle. I don't know if there's a sequel to this, but I'd hope not, because the first book was so full of plot holes and lack of explanation that I don't know how they could go anywhere with it."
4,"Great CD, But if this is available why is it $50?","Came to Amazon to buy this yesterday, $50? Wow, I thought some company had re-released it.....I found it at Great Escape Nashville for $6.99........oh well, have been a Babys fan all my life, seen them live 6 or 8 times and hung with John W. many times...........I agree it is a close second to Headfirst, I keep asking Tony B. when they're going to re-unite and he says,""Ask John!"" So, if anybody reading this is involved, how about a vintage Babys concert on DVD, goodness knows they were way ahead of the game as far as video presentation goes. Great CD, buy it if you can afford it!"
5,"On An Roll with ""Union Jacks""","After the extemely successful 1978's ""Head First"", The Babys continued their growing success as a band with 1980's ""Union Jacks"". Adding extremely talented songwriter and keyboardist Jonathan Cain along with bassist Ricky Phillips, the group delivered a solid 9-song album that had the huge hits ""Back On My Feet Again"" and ""Midnight Rendezvous"" constantly blaring from FM radio stations.John Waite again shines brightly with his vocal prowess and shows continued versatility throughout as this album differs just a bit from the previous as it takes a very successful, overall harder power pop posture primarily dominated from the masterful keyboard power of the talented Cain. That combined with a growing maturity in their songwriting helped with the inclusion of Cain as well as Phillips proved ""Union Jacks"" another winner!"
4,great looking pair of sandals,they are really cute casual sandals but the sole is wooden and after walking in them it was hurting the ball of my foot i would recommend those new gel pads as inserts for more comfort.
3,good as a second reference,"For an introductory classical mechanics book, Marion is definitely lacking. I have been using his book, though, as a second resource to Goldstein's Classical Dynamics, since his examples (particularly the Lagrange problems and small oscillation problems) are very helpful. I agree with other reviews in that he does not delve deeply enough, theoretically, into the heart of classical mechanics."
2,DO NOT USE THIS AS A FIRST BOOK!!,"This book contains for more math than words, and should only be used by readers who are already fairly familiar with mechanics. Not that there is nothing to be learned from this book--there is! There is plenty of theory contained here, but if you don't know the ropes already, you'll be lost faster than Gore in his backyard. You need to be at least an undergrad who has taken an intro. to mechanics course before reading this text."
3,"Good text, worthless binding.","This text is well written and enjoyable. Thornton takes pains to explain in English what he's doing with the mathematics. However, the manufacture of the book is terrible. I had only been using the book for a few months when it split in half right down the spine."
4,"Great at Lagrangian & Hamiltonian Dynamics,","I am unsure on why the ratings of this textbook are so low, it is a very solid textbook on undergraduate mechanics. Its treatment of the caclulus of varations and Lagrangian & Hamiltonian dynamics is very elegant and clear. It is the best treatment out there at the undergraduate level.In other topics it is strong as well, but not as strong as the Lagrangian/Hamiltonian treatment. The physical ideas conveyed are very good. The math is not really that formal, it just requires what is needed to do Analytical mechanics: the normal calculus sequence, Differential Equations, and Linear Algebra. The problems are not easy, but you can not expect them to be at this level of physics.The only stumbling block of the textbook is at times the mathematical notation (outside of Lagrangian/Hamiltonian Dynamics) is cumbersome and just plain bad. It is just notation however, and it just needs getting used to."
4,A not-so-bad book on mechanics,"I don't understand why the reviews are so negative on the book. It's certainly not at the top level of undergrad physics books, like Griffiths E&M for example. however, it present the basics in a fairly easy to read and easy to follow way. The price is ridiculous, but most physics textbooks aren't far off from the amount. If you want to see a truly bad undergrad physics textbook that should have been buried long ago, go look at Reif's Stat. Phys. book."
1,Professors: Please do NOT adopt this text.,"If the physics community is wondering why we are producing physicists at the lowest rate in 40 years, they might consider the quality of their pedagogy. Thornton provides an unnecessary character-building experience while failing to explain the problems that every physics graduate must know. While we are all impressed that his wife was an astronaut, he succeeds only in spoiling the work of the late, great Marion. It was only because of an outstanding professor at Cal State Chico that I learned what I did."
1,A mathematically formal piece of crap.,"The table of contents sure looks promising. Buta pretentious and unnecessary mathematical formalism obscures everything. Simple concepts are made obscure by lousy explanations. Apparently the authors assume that the student is born knowing these concepts. The physical concepts are not motivated, only presented in a facy polished way which is totally useless to the student.This book is a notorious, famous stinker which will hopefully be soon put out to pasture. Lousy overall!"
1,horrible book,"I had the displeasure of using this book over the course of two semesters. ""Classical Dynamics"" is poorly constructed, gives weak examples, and the explanations are less than clear. The first five chapters seem like a pitiful extension to physics 1. My plea to professors, please stop using certain textbooks just out of tradition."
1,I wish there were a lower rating than one star,"Why the hell does this book cost 110$ ... its bound badly, the problems are hellishly ambiguous and a number of other bad bad things that i cant think of due to the fury that i am experiencing due to this book and the amount it has just cost me!"
5,Classical Dynamics of particles and systems,"Book arrived in slightly lower condition than I expected. Other than that a good experience, would buy from same vender again."
2,If I already knew the material it wouldn't be so bad.,"I'm taking physics 105 at UC Berkeley and we're using Marion and Thornton in my class. I like using the book as a reference, but I think that each chapter does a poor job of explaining how to solve the problems that appear in the end of each chapter. There are also very few simple problems in the book that allow one to become used to using new methods (like hamiltonian mechanics, and the use of lagrangians) before using them to solve difficult problems. I would reccommend another mechanics book such as ""Mechanics"" by Landau and Lifschitz or ""Mechanics"" by Symon. Unless you have an excellent instructor, Marion and Thronton is not very much fun to use."
2,it is basically awful,this book does not give any insight on the classical theory of mechanics.Also there is not enough explanations on the subjects.and as an additional disadvantage to all these it does not provide good examples for the reader. the writer should have provided much more figures for the reader in order to make his subjects more clear
2,Leave Goldstein Alone!,"Marion is dead and Mr.Thornton should have left the text be. The only changes Thornton made were bad ones. The examples are incomplete, Symbols are introduced without definition. The problems are challenging if one could ever discern what the question is! To top it all off the author almost blindly takes word for word sections straight out of Goldstein's classic text. Now this is not particularly bad, he is given reference, but Goldstein is thorough. This text is lost in laziness. The key steps which I feel a student needs specific direction, are left out! So a word to instructors who teach undergraduate mechanics...just use Goldstein, and design problems of your own. Marion and Thornton's text is in need for replacement"
1,An awful text,"I had the misfortune of taking a class that used this book. This book contains piles of mathematical expressions barely any of which are adequatelly explained. This text is intended to be used in courses that introduce mathematical methods in physics, what it actually does, is present some qualitative ideas and some equations that don't really seem to connect to the text unless you already know the material. This book would make a nice rewiew material for someone who learned the subject already, however, in no way it provides any real insight into the priciples of physics that it attempts to explain.This book really is one of those unfortunate examples that are targeted at beginnig students, but are only readable to professors."
2,Overrated Mechanics text,"I fail to understand why is this book become a standard required text for undergrad mechanics in all the major American universities. The book describes at length esoteric problems and concepts (such as the falling chain tension using energy conservation in chater 9) while completely ignores basic things such as Principle of Virtual work,statics & stability in systems of Particles. In all it is an average text with lot of useless space age stuff which the author seems to brag about."
4,"Good -- IF you have a good instructor, too","I was fortunate to have an excellent instructor for my mechanics courses, and we used this book in both semesters. Although it *is* true that the problems are rather vaguely stated, if one has an instructor who's good, and is willing to help figure out what the problems ask for, it's a good text. Quite a few grad schools assume its depth for preparation, too. And the sections on the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches are quite good, although an intuitive ""feeling"" for them is not communicated or developed. I wish Feynman had spent more time on them in his Lectures!"
3,KJV Bible mp3,"I found the narration to be well paced for me. He reads the text accurately and with proper enunciation, faithfully following the KJV Authorized Edition. Other versions are liberal with their reading by often substituting difficult phrases with their private interpretation sometimes changing critical meaning. This is one of the attributes that attracted me to this version. At times I found the background music distracting but at other times it was just OK. I value the recording.But, my mp3 players will not play all of the tracks in my car. For example, the first cd seems to end on I Samuel 22 but on my computer cd-rom I can address all of the tracks through I Kings. I actually bought the cd for my car to redeem the time that I drive so this is disapointing but only midly detracts. I worked around this by ripping to my own cd which made me smile! It is a good version."
1,"Monotonous, unexpressive, rushed recording","I did not like this version at all. I think the narrator is rushed, monotonous, unexpressive and boring. I could not absorb the material, it was read so quickly that I didn't have time to think about anything. If you want a really good recording, one that is well-paced, and thoughtfully and expressively done, look at the Scourby or Waggoner editions. I think Scourby is the best without a doubt, but Waggoner is a close second, for a very enjoyable learning experience."
3,Good Graphics...... BUT !,"The graphics improved much. That's good! But now I can't get my printer to print. A computer repair man said the printer just quit. NO, NO, NO. The printer just doesn't get the signal to print. The printer hasn't changed, but it is now useless.I blame your ASUS - graphics adapter.Sorry to report this, but it's true.J. Carl MellingerPS - The printer is a HP 600C Deskjet"
3,mediocre play from one of broadway's greatest,"i'm a huge fan of sondheim's musicals and i quite like his and furth's collaboration on -company-. w/ that said, this play was quite disappointing. the play has the same type of new york characters as in -company-, but here they're much, much more like stereotypes and caricatures. as for the plot, i was expecting it to be a mystery which is quite untrue as the murderer is revealed before the act 1 curtain. the actual subtitle is ""a comedy thriller"" and although there are indeed some funny moments as well as some ""horror"" elements, there's just not enough of either. there are some attempts at social comedy, but those don't really go anywhere either. i'd recommend it only if you're a sondheim completist like i am."
4,Self tanner towels,I did not want to lay in the sun this summer. This product worked so good that people did not know it wasn't a tan from the sun.
4,Looks natural,"I'm very fair and was looking for a product that looked natural and wouldn't streak. I've been using this product for years. The only challenge I have with it is my feet, as any shoes with tight fitting areas will rub off the tan color and make my feet look blotchy."
3,I want to be tan!,"Unfortunately, I have not been successful in getting my legs tanned without streaking no matter how I apply. No problems with my arms or face. My friends who use this product have not had similar problems. Maybe my legs are too white to cover! :-)"
3,Not crazy about them,These towels roll up while you are using them so they do not give complete and even coverage. There is streaking & you can't know about it until a day or two. Wouldn't waste my money on these again. The original tan towels are much better
2,not as good as tan towels,"Last year I used TanTowels, which I loved. Could not find a good deal so I tried these. So far I have had lots of splotchy coverage. what's more- the formula is such that the cloth is really wet when you first open it , then cloth dries really fast so it is hard to get even coverage. I am going back to TanTowels."
5,Quality fan.,"Looks great. Simple to install, with great directions. Perfectly balanced as it came from the box. You can pay MUCH more for a fan, but why? Completely silent on low and medium speed. My handyman, who installed this with my ""supervision"", said this was the nicest fan he ever put up. Getr this."
2,Hunter let me down,"The fan is attractive but very hard to install and operate. I had it professionally installed by a contractor who is used to hard work. When it proved to be too much for one person, another had to be called in. If I want to change the speed, I have to get a step stool and manfully (womanfully?) pull on the chain. It tips the fan almost sideways before it will engage. On the highest speed, the fan sways until I'm afraid it will work itself loose from the ceiling so I use either the lowest speed or the mid speed. I've had Hunter fans before that were great but I wouldn't buy another one of this type."
1,Surprisingly Boring,"The story is a continuous conversation....as if you're patiently waiting for the person to get to the point. Very predictable and many pages can be skipped when reading and you won't miss a thing. I actually looked at the cover to make sure that I downloaded a Danielle Steel book or thought maybe it was written by someone with the same name, different spelling. It just wasn't up to the ""Steel"" standards in my opinion."
5,Loved it!!,"This was a great read. A little predictable towards the end, but still a great story. This is one of my new favorites!"
1,Very predictable,"After reading ""The Kiss"", I've given up on Danielle Steel. This book is very predictable. Also, the book is longer than it needs to be, as the last several chapters could have been condensed in to one. The same thing is said over and over and it's just a waste of time. I find with Danielle Steel's later novels is that she recycles the same plot, and only changes the character names, and sometimes the setting."
2,Second star given grudgingly,"You have to have a little respect for someone who can find a way to say the same thing a hundred different times. Oh my goodness, Steel can create great plots but it boggles my mind that her editors let this repetition go unchecked. Of course, I keep buying this stuff because of its pure fluff value. I love chick lit. This audiobook has had me throwing things at my ipod speakers, though."
4,DS is back again!,"I have been a fan of Danielle Steel for many years...I have read all her books, and I wait patiently for each new book to come out so I can run out to buy it. The past few books I have been disappointed, feeling like it is not her normal quality great story. In fact, after I would read her book, I would tell myself that the next book I would get at the library or wait until it went to paperback (but of course, I always end up running to the bookstore to buy it when it is released). So I wasn't sure what to expect from The Kiss. I was very pleased. While showing how horrible both Isabelle and Bill's marriage are, making us hate their spouses, you feel the love and the bond that Isabelle and Bill have for each other. You fall in love with their love, and stand behind them while they fight for their lives, and for their love. I finished this book even more excited for her next book to be released. Thank you Danielle, for showing us why we fell in love with your writing!"
1,The Kiss: An Intensely Laborious Waste of Paper,"I have never read a Danielle Steele novel before, but the promised story line and the Gustav Klimt cover drew me in. It sounded like a good, romantic read and I knew Ms. Steele was a very famous and popular author, she must be good, right? Was I ever in for a surprise! This book spews forth the most redundant character analyses I have ever heard in my life! Over and over we hear about how Isabelle has to care for her invalid son Teddy, how her husband is extremely selfish and neglectful, how Bill, her true love, has a very selfish wife. The descriptions are flushed around and around, over and over, like something foul that just can't be gotten rid of. Please, do yourself a tremendous favor, Ms. Steele, and take some time off before attempting to write anything as completely empty and intolerable as this total waste of paper! Highly do not recommend this book! :("
1,That's It,"Ms.Steel is truly the Queen of repition. She needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor. I see that is the ongoing critism of her books. I swore I was never going to read another of her soaps(I can't stand those either) but this given to me by friends that said it was sooo good. I'll stick with the authours I know I like from now on. And I hope she finds some new descriptions to use besides impeccably and exquisite/exquisitely, she has worn these out. BUT she's laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers."
2,Disappointing,"I had never read a Danielle Steel book before, and decided to give her a try, given that she is so popular and has so many books published. I was pretty disappointed. I agree with the other reviewers that the plot is unrealistic; however, if a book is unrealistic but well-written and engaging, I would still like it. I think the biggest problem with this book is the author's excessive repetitiveness. Yes, I get that this character is really cold and unloving---that was already covered 50 pages ago! In addition, character traits could have been better conveyed through situations, rather than simply stating, ""so and so was a devoted mother"" and repeating this fact again and again and again. These flaws in the author's writing kept me skipping through whole sections of the book. This book did not leave me wanting to read more of Ms. Steel's books. It is an ok book if you like romance and very easy, repetitive reading."
2,Romance close to reality,"I enjoyed the romance that went on between Isabelle and Bill. I could understand why they found solace in one another. However, it wasn't one of her better books. I really liked The Promise, which was an earlier book. Maybe that is why this story doesn't have the same simplicity and reality combined. Although it was a good read to pass the time, a better read is Cherrie Kimbrough's Rosewood."
3,An ok read,"This book wasn't bad. A little far-fetched and also a ton of repetitive descriptions. I actually said aloud more than once, ""Ok! I get it already!"" I was quite surprised that Bill didn't have a 100% recovery which gave the story a bit more credibility. I was happy I could read this book, because there have been a couple of her more recent novels that I simply could not get into. So I would recommend this one for a light read."
3,An OK read,"I enjoyed this book, but not as much as some other ones of Steel's. My mother-in-law borrowed this book and enjoyed it more than I did, though."
2,Boring!,"Being an avid D.S. reader for years, this book has been a disappointment. That wasn't too surprising since all her recent books were bad. The Kiss repeated itself over and over so much. Isabelle's character got annoying since she was so weak and kept on defending her husband. I wanted to slap her after awhile. I think in the future, I'll just read the summary of the book on the flaps. I'll probably get just as much doing that than reading the entire book."
2,There are much better books out there...,This book was pretty boring. I only finished it because it was the only book I had with me while on a flight. It is repeatitive and the dialogue is not believable. I would not recommend it.
1,Horrible,I gave up on this one halfway through. I couldn't get into the story and the characters annoyed me. I've read a few other Steel novels and this one read like a mash up of them. Better luck next time.
4,You Will Not Be Disappointed,You will love this book. If you weren't a Danielle Steel Fan is the past. This book will definetely make up for it.
1,"I'm Done, Danielle","Have you ever read an author's book that you disliked so much, you couldn't get it out of your mind? This is another one. This story is so unrealistic, I don't know where to start. One thing for sure no one lacks for money in Ms. Steel's stories, jetting everywhere, staying in 4 Star hotels, calling for cars to take them everywhere. It's a world I can't comprehend. Most people would have been bankrupt after a 2 month hospital stay and 9 months in a top notch rehab. Also a small detail but how does Bill hop into the shower from his wheelchair? None of the hotels I've stayed in have a shower you can roll into and I'm sure Isabella did not reserve a room for physically challenged.I was VERY disappointed in the end when Gordon did not get his come uppance. Better luck with your next effort Ms. Steel"
3,Slow.........,"I have read many of DS's books, this was not my favorite. I think the chracters were very well written, but way toooooooo much about Bill and Isabelle's feelings, the chapters went on and on about how they felt about each other. You get the message loud and clear on that after about three chapters. The ending was not what I expected. It just kinda of ended with - no bang. This is a good read if you want to pass the time reading a love story, but if you want a page turner, don't bother. My favorite by Steele is still by far, Malice."
5,Pure energy,I have not played soccer in years but have children that play and am a big fan of the game. This DVD was riveting and inspiring but most of all FUN. It made me want to get back in the game. My whole family loved the music and stopped what they were doing to watch. I hope there are some sequels coming out. I can't wait to see Freddy! I have given this DVD as a gift to my children's soccer coaches and friends that play soccer.
3,One word - mediocre production,"As a big fan of the Chicago Fire and MLS, I enjoyed the DVD, but it's evident that the production is not of the best quality. The background music kinda stinks also. I don't regret buying it, but I hope that they improve the quality of these DVD's MLS puts out."
1,Not Worth It,"I bought this video with the expectation that i'd be seeing a lot of really good goals, and while there are many good goals, there are also a lot of fairly average goals that don't bear revisiting. The producers were culling goals from the mere eight years the league had existed and they missed a surprising number of really spectacular goals. I also agree with the prior reviewer that some goals are replayed too often (this is a DVD, I can replay it myself if I want to), and the ""special effects"" are gratuitous and distracting.I've been a fan of MLS since they opened shop and there are a lot of highlights missing from this DVD. You're left with the distinct impression that the people who put this DVD together didn't have access to everything they should have to create what purports to be the definitive collection of MLS goals.By the way, I am a D.C. United fan and I may be a little partial, but to show only 3 (maybe 4) goals from the three-time champions of the league is an insult."
4,Sisterhood,I loved this book. Having no siblings myself it gave me a true look at sisterhood. Briscoe looks at 3 sisters who all have their share of problems but pettiness and pride keeps them from reaching out to one another for love and support. This book really makes you think about how we treat our family and weather we truly value what we have.
1,Book NOT in good condition,"Quick shipping but was disappointed with the condition of the book. I was not in ""good"" condition. The pages were all yellow and it looked like it had water damage. I was supposed to share it with another member of my Book Club but was too embarrassed to lend it to her. Very disappointed. Will not order from this merchant again."
2,Nothing Happens,"Absolutely nothing happens in this story. There's minimal character development and growth and it's totally predictable--except you're left wondering how and why it took them so long, and the one, semi-interesting twist was ruined with the first lingering stare. We follow three boring and rather irritating sisters through their dramas, horrid mistakes, and general obnoxiousness. As for the men as a whole being weak, pathetic, crazy, and/or ball-less, there actually are men like that, but they are by no means the majority. Overall, it was a pretty disgusting portrayal of men, and the women were pretty despicable, too."
4,What Waiting to Exhale could be in the hands of a superior writer.,"Briscoe does a wonderful job of creating characters that have a life of their own. Another thing she does well, and what Terry McMillan failed to do so miserable in Waiting to Exhale, was to create symphathetic characters. I could find it in my heart to fell bad for Bevery, Charmaine, and Evelyn, who though are all flawed, are each trying their best to make it in life. Unlike the ladies in McMillan's novel, who just want everything handed to them on a silver platter with no regard of how they conduct themselves or treat others.I thouroughly enjoyed the novel, and though it lagged a bit at the end, felt it was the most satisfying read i've had in a while."
3,Nice Work,"I started reading this book, and because of other things happening in my life, I had to stop and restart. I must say that this was a good piece of work. I related to these ladies and their everyday issues. I think that it was good how Connie gave all three sisters a different lifestyle from one another, it kind of added a bit of spice to the story.jnb"
3,Male Bashing,"The writing overall was good, but the content of the book was tearing down the black man. I understand where the sisters in the book were coming from, but they made it seem that most black men are bad. With the exception of Kevin, Evelyn's husband, every man in the book was a nut case or just no good. The book could have been written better and showed more unity."
5,Very satisfied customer,The shipment was recieved in excellent condition.Item works great.Were very satisfied
3,Gish the great,"i love silent movies,i love lilian Gish,i loved this film,Griffith's master piece,iwould have given it 5 or 7 stars BUT.... the irritating soundtrack spoiled the enjoyment,my advice is to watch it with volume OFF."
4,One of the silent classics,"I recently purchased this DVD to replace my battered old VHS copy. The picture quality is quite good for the most part, although allowances have to be made for a movie that's ninety years old. My only real quibble with this DVD is that includes no special features. Otherwise, I highly recommend purchasing this film."
2,Avoid this version,"I would give the movie five stars - it is one of my favorite silent films - but the low rating is for the Alpha DVD. It is of a bad print, very dark and scratchy. But the worst is the dreary, monotonous organ score - absolutely horrible! As a longtime fan of silent films, I believe firmly that a quality musical score is essential to our enjoyment, particularly of a lengthy drama such as this one. Choose either the Kino or the Image DVD."
4,Silent Classic,"I had the fortune of seeing this film, via Turner Classic Movies about a year ago. Its story rings true for all time periods. A silent film has a great benefit over talkies; You must Act to the fullest of acting, in order to portray your character. The actors and actresses of the twenties used every resource, but their voices to convey a story. That's what makes this movie such a treat. You sympathize with Lillian's character when she is betrayed and you cheer for her when she is victorious. The film is long, but worth the watch."
1,Lousy DVD Print,"Impossible to enjoy this DVD due to terrible, washed-out, fussy print.Film needs major restoration!!!"
4,Good print but not the original version,"This Alpha release of ""Way Down East"" is easily one of the better ones the company has on the market. The print is extremely watchable and tastefully packaged (completely unlike their version of ""Orphans Of The Storm""). However, note that the print used is a re-edited version Griffith recut for the film's re-release in 1930, a decade after the movie's original release.So that means that Griffith fans will want to have this dvd in their collections but also need to have the original version from the Image or Kino releases..."
3,Can't push buttons while in the case,"I had the same problem with this product as other reviewers: I couldn't push the buttons through the plastic screen. I ended up just cutting off the part of the screen over the controls, which wasn't very difficult, and now it works pretty well. I don't have any issues with the rubbery case emptying my pockets, but then I don't usually keep it in my pockets. I also don't find the velcro strap to be unstable: I just wrap it a little tighter and it works great for my runs. There aren't many armband cases for the zen micro on the market, so sure it would be great if there were a better one, but this one isn't bad and it's the best one I've found."
2,Bad for Controls,Attractive design other than I could not get the controls to work thru the clear plastic. The plastic needs to be thinner.
4,Good Sequel,"Despite what our illiterate friend above has said, this is actually a very above-average series. Anyone who has seen the first ROD will definitely like to see the fleshing out of both Yomiko's and The British Library Force's background. The action sequences are fun to watch, and the character development is quite good."
5,Awakening by Facet-Eyes,"The aim of the story-to awaken the readers to the detrimental practices of humans in the environment- is well achieved through a science fiction story of a young scientist transmutated into a bee. The most telling scene in the story to me was the description of a devastation by aerial spraying with insectides. How much destruction to avert a small perceived danger to the crop? The novel offers also a well researched insight into the lives, physiology of the bees. What a delicate, advanced beings, inhabitants of the earth for so many million years. A well wortwhile reading for everybody and a great potential for a movie manuscript."
1,If only there were zero stars,"Rarely has a book succeeded whose only mission was to denigrate and negate the heartfelt report of an uncommon experience. Rarely has such a book inspired compassion, or lofty, noble ideals. In the very rare persuasive rebuttals of this sort, artistry and a level of authenticity have been present... Unfortunately, this book is not rare."
3,watered down work from otherwise one of Russia's greatest writers,"There's some shock value in this understated portrayal of a day in a Russian forced labor camp. As a snapshot of a day a lifestyle where keeping warm and getting an extra crumb to eat are constant obsessions, this is effective. But this is not really a novel. There's no plot, not a lot of character development, very little suspense, and not even a lot of dialogue.If you were only to read one book by Solzenhitsyn, this should not be it. This short work doesn't even begin to approach the brilliant character development and insight into human motivations of one of Solzhenitsyn's longer works, such as First Circle."
3,wouldn't read it again,"The novel is one of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's earlier creations. I am very patient, and I did finish it but it seemed like it took forever. I know this is not one of those fast cliché stories and it's not supposed to be an easy read but sadly it didn't hold my attention. Author's writing style was disjointed, overwhelming and hard to follow. I am NOT not recommending it, I am suggesting that before purchasing this book please consider reading Solzhenitsyn's later novels first, he got better at writing (Cancer Ward, The First Circle, The Gulag Archipelago). If you start with this novel, you may decide that Solzhenitsyn works are not for you, but they are really worth reading... I have read each of them at least twice, and will do it again some day, I will not go back to One day in the life of ID. It's resting on my special torture-to-read shelf..."
3,O book feel it a bit over rated,I heard a lot about this book and was looking forward to reading it. To be hones I found it quite mediocre and forced my way through it rather then enjoyed it.
5,"Only 3,650 more to go...","This slim volume gives us a close up look at one day in a Stalin-era labor camp. Not much more can be added to the volumes of commentary about Solzhenitsyn's masterful little horror story. Why is it important for us to read it? Because the U.S. may no longer be on the outside of the gulag business looking in. If you are beginning to think that torturing prisoners just might be a good idea, you know, efficient, not to mention possibly essential to protecting the Homeland...read the book. Or if some small part of you thinks ""You know, maybe that Joe Arpaio guy is right, teaching those criminals a lesson in accountability,"" read what happens when we forget the guys in the striped pajamas are also human beings. Read what happens to us when we brutalize them.Just read the book."
5,All classics,"I have read most of Solzhenitsyn's books both in English and German, each time forgetting time and space when I was reading. Then I traveled Russia and stayed in the hotel in Khabarovsk in the Russian Far East where he stayed upon his return to Russia, and I cruised the Amur River along which the Gulags he so vividly described existed. Alone near the front of the boat in the early morning hours, I pictured his prisoners in the bitter cold, totally isolated in a huge area that is cut off from the world except for the winters because of the marshes, but also escape-proof in winter because no one can survive those temperatures.What literature, what landscape, what a country!"
4,enter a new world...for a day,"what makes this book worth four stars is as much what is says as what it does not. going into painstaking detail about one day in the life of a prisoner in the gulag - one of like 10,000 days of his prisoner life - this book conjures up a whole world.at points it was a little tedious and hard to follow, but the main thrust of the roughness of his life just made the journey from cover to cover one worth following.main plus of the book and thing making it worth reading: snapped me out of my little world for a few hours and made me grateful about how my life is...about my freedom. that guy was a modern slave. and i'm not. like bob marley says: emancipate yourself from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our minds. well, this book helps."
5,I was fascinated with A Day in the Life...,"Solshenitzyn portrays with lucidness and realism the horrors that took place in the Soviet Union's prison camps. Many of the tactics used by the USSR are depicted in the novel. What intrigued me the most was how labor was used to eliminate any sense of time and contact with the outside world. It demonstrates how Soviet psychology, which delved in mind-manipulating techniques, implemented its horrid program of human conditioning. The book, above every thing else, depicts the endurance of the human spirit in the midst of the most horrid conditions that man is capabale of creating. A Day in the Life... is a must read."
5,Moving,"When I picked up this book and noted the page length, I thought there wasn't going to be much to this book. How wrong was I? I was bowled over by the powerful yet unembelished prose. Solzhenitsyn tells it like it is without grasping at any purpleness that would push the book over the edge. Cold, hungry, forced to work under horrible conditions, Ivan Denisovich and his gang members make do while somehow managing to not lose the things that make them who they are in the real world."
4,One Day in the life of Ivan Denisovich,"when I was about 13/14 years of age I read this book, and found it interesting what can I say I read it again now, after knowing so much more as I did then about 'Gulags' life and my empathy for the underprivileged and having friends now from Russia I understand much more, Judy"
3,Good content and ideas but slow story line,"One Day expresses important themes of optimism that was needed to survive in a concentration camp like Ivan Denosivich does in this book. He does this very well by putting Ivan though a day filled with simplistic activities. However, the book can seem booring at times because of the booring and unimportant events. You think to yourself ""do we really need to read this much about him building a brick wall?"" Overall, the book had a good purpose and themes but the storyline was a little unexpresive."
3,Required Reading,I bought this for my daughter because it was assigned reading. I don't think it was something she would have read on her own. The focus of the class was to think about what life is/was like in different countries at different times. For that this was a good book. it took her outside 2011 America and helped her to realize how different live is around the world.
3,"Wouldn't really be worth your time, if it wasn't so short.","I'd give this book 2 stars if it weren't for the historical and political significance it has accrued. Like a lot of ""dissident"" literature, Solzhenitsyn's work has become overrated. The narrative voice here changes abruptly from an erudite prose to ""Shukhov"" speaking colloquially, and back again. The political points made are as unsubtle as the characters themselves. And really, when you think about it, Ivan Denisovich Shukhov doesn't really have that bad of a day...just a dull one."
2,One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,"A detailed book involving creativity and lots of describing words about Ivan Denisovich in a Russian prison camp. Ivan Denisovich was put in jail for treason and sentenced to ten years in prison. Through the book it talks about Ivan and what his life is like in cold northern Russia. It is a slow book, that is not very exciting, but has lots of details of how the setting is and has a creative plot."
5,A must for classic fans,"One of the best books I've ever read. A must for anyone intrested in the subject of stalinism. Very short, straight to the point, straight to your heart. I've you ever thought that life is unjust and cruel, read this book and your thankful of everything you have."
5,Something Everyone Should Read,"I was assigned to read this book in a Russian History & Lit Class. I found it impossible to enjoy because I hated the class so much. However, this year in a World Lit class I've re-read it and discovered how wonderful it is. It tells of a story that very few people actually experience in a lifetime. If one is at all interested in history, psychology, literature, censorship, or the Russian way of life under Communism, I strongly recoment this novel"
3,Tough to get through but worth it,"Of the Russian/Soviet writers only three are noteworthy and Solzhenitsyn is one of the best. While this was my first book by the author, I knew its impact would be great. The basis behind the book is the life of prisoners in the GULAG. Unless you are a die-hard historian or really enjoy this type of bare bones information, you may not like this book. I find it valuable for 20th Century history to show the extremes man has forced on himself and others and how man can survive no matter what."
1,Boorrring!-David,"First of all I am an 13 yr old who was told to read this book for my Ad English class, I found this book to be very boring. Keep in mind that i am 13. I think this book is for people over 20 at least unless they don't want to get bored out of their wits!"
2,Read Dostoevsky--forget Solzhenitsyn.,"Read ""Crime & Punnishment"". Read ""The Brothers Karmazov"". Read ""Night"", by Elie Wiesel if you want a better look at prison/labor camps, but for heavensake...forget Ivan Desinovich!"
4,Makes you want to know more about Soviet past,"I can't believe that I was this interested in a book that takes place over a single day. The concept sounds boring, but it makes you realize that there are situations where the small things in life really do matter, and everyplace has its rules. The character is street wise and very likeable. I read this during the Northeast heatwave in the 90 degree range with no air conditioning and fantasized about the sub-zero cold!"
3,"Very sad, but educational","Not many of us can say we have experienced anything as dramatic as what the characters in this book have to experience on a daily basis.With that in mind, this book is highly educational, showing us one ordinary day in the life of one of the thousands of people who lived, and in some countries still live under terrible conditions.The story is a sad one, not because of violence, which it has virtually none, but because the idea of living that life every single day is brutal, and it just tears your heart apart.I am not sure I loved the way it was written, it seemed too simple, but it did make the reading go faster."
5,One Good Day in the Gulag,"First read this book in the 1970s, have read it again many times since. These days I read it if I am feeling depressed. It is not the suffering discribed in the book but the wonder and hope that the smallest of gifts of fortune bring to the main character that gives me the uplift I need to over come my depression. The old saying, ""There go I but for the grace of God."", comes to mind as well.I think that this book should be required reading for every high school kid, every convict in prison, every prison guard, and anyone who has given up hope.There is a movie released in 1970. Can find it in VHS, $38 to $130 used. Think I will stick to the book until I win the Lotto Jackpot."
5,Succulents: The Illustrated Dictionary,"Truly a succulent bible, if you grow these plants, you cannot be without this book."
1,This is not a good curler.,"I cant get this thing to curl at all. Even when i can get all my lashes into this strange contraption, it still does not curl them. Dont waste your money."
3,"Excellent, out-of-date, and expensive","Like many people, I cannot justify the great expense of upgrading to Adobe's Photoshop5. Since I already had Photoshop4, I just needed some extra information on using the software for web based design (Photoshop4's area of weakness). That's where this book comes in.It really is an excellent book, but having already had its 2nd birthday, it is now showing its age in many areas. Thus it is a catch22 situation. Its a great book and one of few that still deals with an older software package, yet it needs some revision. I'm not sure I'll keep it yet.Perhaps if the out-of-date sections were removed OR the price was dropped so that it was more realistic, it would remain a winner.Email me if you want to know more about how useful it actually is (and whether I kept it)."
4,best horse that ever lived,Great little reminder of the best horse that ever lived. I bought one of these for one of my kids and then the others wanted one.
5,"Secretariat Beanie--good, but why are there nioFILLY Beanies?","I got this 'Secretariat"" beanie (along with the '133rd Kentucky Derby Horse' beanie) about a month ago--it's beautiful, but I can;t help wondering why there are so many 'colt' beanies & NO 'filkly' beanies--I mean, FOUR of Barbaro? That's overkill! Meanwhile, deserving FILLIES like Ruffian, Genuine Risk, & Rags to Riches go unrecognized, which I think is HIGHLY UNFAIR...!"
5,Enchanting,"David T. Carter is brilliant! He had my heart in two minutes. His poetic lyrics are enchanting and richly soulful. His style fresh and unique. This Renaissance Man is a true romantic and hypnotically captivating. Once you are under his spell, hang on to your heart, for the stories he weaves will take you through the gamut and then some. His highly skilled and trancelike fingerpicking, whether country, jazz or blues, inspires awe. A profoundly talented songwriter and one who has fully lived his tales, David T. Carter's music escapes categorization as he plays far outside the box. Powerful and playful to tender and sexy. His songs are purely delightful!!"
5,Excellent Find!,This is one of the best finds in my reading for 2002. A great introduction to Sean Russell's great stories and deep plots it has everything a great story needs. After reading this I couldn't help myself but get his other books and I am not dissapointed! If you like fantasy or science fiction then this book is a must.While the characters are slow to be introduced it is a problem every writer faces and is well made up for by there human-like qualities in a world completely believable. Great work Sean Russell!
3,It was a good fun read,"I thought that this book was exciting and well written. It kept me on the tip of my chair and enthused. However, it wasnt as good a book to read if you want to read a very good and worth while book for depth. This was a book that i would suggest just reading in spare time for the fun of it."
1,A bore,"I purchased this book based on all the good reviews, however, I was very disappointed in this book and could barely finish it. I found the characters to be very vague and unfriendly. I did not care for them nor cared what happened to them. I found myself knowing as little at the ending of the book as I did at the beginning. I realize that this is only the first book however, my interest was never sparked and I have little curosity in the outcome of the story. I, for one, will not be searching for the next book in the series."
5,Very practical guide for beginners,"The reviews in the media are quite favorable and do justice to the book. I just wanted to add that due to this guide I saved anywhere between 15k and 20k by not buying during a hard sell timeshare presentation. Thanks Michael, the timeshare does not fir my lifestyle."
2,"Some good information, very effectively disguised","It's hard to believe I read the same book as the other reviewers. While I believe there is some really useful information in this book, it is very hard to identify it. It seems every page has grammatical and spelling errors, missing words, and seemingly random thoughts assembled into a paragraph. This book could probably be one-third the size if the information was organized and presented just once instead of popping up randomly over and over.[...] should be embarrassed by their association with this result. It shows what self-publishing can produce and shows by its absence the value of editing and proofreading."
5,"THE BABYS ""ON THE EDGE""","This whole CD is just great from begining to end, whether you are a John Waite fan or not you will love this high energy CD. Just gets you moving and singing along. Starting with ""Turn and Walk Away"" the great vocals from all and guitar licks from Wally Stocker & Jonathan Cain. To the heart-full vocals of John Waite on ""Darker Side Of Town"" . Then to the really rocking vocals of Jonathan Cain with ""Too Far Gone"". This CD along with ""Anthology"" is not to to be forgotten, out of any John Waite or Babys' collection."
1,Little or no spanish,"While the pictures are pretty, I was very disappointed with the spanish words ""scattered"" through out the poems. Some poems don't contain any spanish at all; others only one word. This is not a book for introducing spanish by intermingling spanish with english. Very disappointing. I also purchased Pelitos and Oye al desierto and was myc happier with those books. Don't waste your money on this book if you're wanting to combine spanish and english."
5,Awesome CD!!!,"I saw Neurosonic live in DC, and they sound exactly the same as on this CD. They played with Puddle of Mudd, and if you like them, you'll love Neurosonic!!! The first song on the CD is about Ashley Simpson if you don't figure it out from the references. The whole album is great!!!"
1,The cat whisperer,I find it hard to believe that the author has ever met a cat.The Cat Whisperer: The Secret of How to Talk to Your Cat
1,Do Yourself A Favor And SKIP This Book,"I've read dozens of cat books in the last few years, and frankly I just thought this one was a waste of money. There is no new info here, no new point of view, nothing that isn't available in a dozen other cat books, and better written at that. Someone who picked up ""Cats For Dummies"" would get more plentiful, useful information."
2,The Cat Whisperer: The Secret of How to Talk to Your Cat,"At the beginning of this book, the author attempts to get us to understand from a cat's perspective on what it must be like to live with humans by comparing cats to Eskimos who suddenly move to the jungle. I nearly couldn't read any further. It is a distracting and unappetizing comparison with which Native people may be all too familiar.Throughout the book, the author seems to go on and on about the relative popularity of dogs to cats. She includes far too much about dogs and their behavior characterstics in relation to people. If this were a book about cats and dogs that might have been appropriate. However, in this book, it was simply another distraction.There are a few interesting things, but overall doesn't cover any new ground that Desmond Morris hasn't already covered."
4,The Cat Whisperer,"I have been looking for a book to help understand normal cat behavior for a while and this is the first one that comes close to being useful. The writing style is very good and it makes for an enjoyable read. The author obviously loves cats and I felt she was approaching her subject with great kindness.Even though I am a cat lover, the details given in the book about what makes cats ""tick"" seemed just about right for a layperson and really did help me see my cat in a new, better way.For anyone just curious about what their cat is up to, this would make a nice resource for them I highly recommend it."
1,The Cat Whisperer: The Secret of How to Talk to Your Cat,"Aside from the catchy title, I found little of use in this book that supposedly deals with cat communication. Any 'tasty morsels' were far and few between. Does the author even own a cat?"
1,Does not fit cars,this looks to be a great item and it may be for a lot of truckers. It was too big for my daughters GrandAm. I don't know if this works or not but I got it so I would be able to do a break job on my daughters car. She is away at colledge and the lock key broke when she came home to get them fixed. I ordered this product and it was a good price but it was too big to even try. I had her come back home to try again after getting this product and was again not able to get the locks off. My neighbor pounded a socket onto the lock and took off all four locks so I could do the break job. It looks like it would be much easier if it were the right size.
3,Ordered and delivered,"The product arrived quickly, but it needs some instructions as I could not get it to work. I took the car to a trusted mechanic and watched him do it. you need to hammer it a few times before engaging the pneumatic impact wrench/gun. additionally you need to use a quality impact gun as you need the torque and force to engage the nut to the keyed lugs. Good product, it just needs some instructions."
2,Too big!,Read all the reviews.. you really have to measure out the lug that needs to be pulled before you buy these so-called do all kits that claim they will pull most standard size lugs. I have regular size 16inch truck wheels and these removal lugs are several milimeters too big!
2,Does Not Fit on My McGARD LockNut,"I lost the key to my McGard LockNut. I bought this set in hopes of removing the locking nut. While the design/concept appears to be the answer, the two sockets are too big. Even the smaller one just fits over the nut and can't grip it. I have tried it with both an impact driver and an impact wrench. The only thing left to try is to possibly wrap the nut with some Gorilla Tape and try to tighten the hold on the nut."
1,Ugly shoes,"The first Steve Madden shoes I didn't like them..!! They look like they have oil stains..!! for a country cowboy looks will be OK, but not for city looks...!!!"
4,Great sound but...,This is a great sounding CD as far as audio quality goes but you either have to LOVE classical or be familiar with the particular works played to get the most enjoyment out of it.
1,Hard to believe this is still being sold.,"I was hoping this text would have information that might be helpful for any disaster. Unfortunately about half of it explains why we should be worried about y2k. The other half has very dated examples of what some are doing and references other sources. Many of the internet resources referenced are no longer in service or have no content like year200.com.Utne paints this utopia that will form as we get to know our neighbors better when many services we take for granted fail and we have to fend for ourselves in Year 2000.A casual look around at utne.com found no mention of this book, Y2K, or preparing for disaters. Perhaps this book was an embarassment after Y2K came and went with out incident.At this point the book is only useful as a window into history and the thinking of some people at the time. There is much better information out there on disaster preparedness."
3,Not bad for the price,"This little book is compilation of articles written by 10-15 authors. Several of the opening articles repeat information presented by earlier authors. It has some good information on what you can do to get the your community involved, make some personal preparation, and a few pages on preparing yourself for the potential psychological challenges. Overall, it's a good introduction and overview of Y2K issues and preparedness. A small book that's easy to read. I wouldn't want to pay more than $5 for it though."
3,Bad Sound Quality,Great album but the MP3 sound quality is poor. Noise and pops are present through out most of the tracks. Plus one song 'The Turn Again' is only 0:16 when the song is really over 5 minutes long. Bad job who ever cut out the MP3 files.
2,Do Not Buy This Version,"As one other reviewer pointed out, the quality is poor. At least 3 of the tracks have noise, and one of the tracks was truncated. You cannot get your money back. Bhakti Point is really nice, but buy it from a different MP3 vendor."
4,A Gem in your pocket !,"Crammed full of useful and practical advice. Font is hard to read sometimes. Still, a must have for anyone who wants to learn."
4,Great service,Fast shipping! Hub functions correctly. Cosmetically there was tape on the top of the hub indicating what the previous owner had plugged into each port. Would purchase again from this vendor.
2,disapointed,The wallet has 2 flaps and after about 1 week of use the fastener under the upper flap is pulling away from the leather. I noticed it was a little tight to fasten and unfasten and then it began to tear loose. Very disapointed
2,cheap material,"I'm disappointed in this item, expected better of Buxton. For the price I didn't expect leather but did think it would be a quality substitute. This feels nasty. The only reason it gets two stars is the design. It is exactly what I need to pop in and out of the large (nice leather) bag I need for work. I'll use it til I find a better substitute, if it doesn't fall apart first."
4,Purchase for Birthday Gift,The bag arrived and was well received by my friend to whom I sent it as a gift. She was pleased with the color andconvenience of it and emailed her delight at receiving it.
3,Nice BUT,"This is not leather if it is very cheap and the double flaps make it difficult to navigate inside it is hard to snap the closure snap i cut inside flap off easily, and my husband notice that cards inside the flap slots could easily fall out. The height is incorrect it is more like 4"" tall with both flaps on and i needed 5"" tall. It still hold a lot but will see how long it last that is why i wanted leather."
1,This bag is not purple as advertised,"The bag is pretty, but was advertised as purple, but it is pink, and will be returned to the company."
2,Not up to her usual standard.,This effort is published now after more than a decade on the shelf. Perhaps it should have been left there.
4,Great information for all levels of video conference administrators,"This book covers all the small details of video conferencing providing valuable information for beginners to experts. Being new to video conferencing, this book provided a great history of the subject and helped me understand the role of each of the protocols. However now being 12 years old, some of the information is dated so the newer version (2005) may have more recent info."
2,Great efforts to collect all the info,"That why almost 50% of the book are appendices. You will get the very general big picture, but no more deep knowledge."
3,Nashville Skyline the sole standout on this otherwise-lackluster compilation,"Flame me if you will, but neither John Wesley Harding nor New Morning ever did much for me. The former seemed to me like a dull load of overtly-religous messages with occasional great songs thrown in just for good measure, and the latter a dull attempt to capture the joy of the domestic life. Only Nashville Skyline stands out here, in my mind. Though it isn't Bob's album by several country miles, it's still good fun. So just pick up Nashville Skyline and Greatest Hits Volume II."
5,great product,"Heavy duty, and quiet. If you have a stereo guitar, or want to record from a headphone out on an amp, then this is the one you want. The cable that came with my $3,000 parker guitar, was thin and noisy, especialy on the acoustic end, this solved the issues."
3,Works...,"I frequently have trouble falling asleep, which is a big problem because if I don't get 8 hours I have a lot of trouble waking up in the morning for work. I sometimes take Bennadryl, because it makes you really drowsy, but I was afraid there might be negative effects to taking bennadryl on a regular basis, so I decided to try this out. It did work in that I was able to fall asleep, however I woke up ~3 hours ago and I still feel drowsy/spacey. I did take two Midol (which contain caffeine) to try and offset it. I wouldn't recommend this product to someone like me who frequently suffers from insomnia as it does make you feel weird the next day."
2,Don't Take When Pregnant or Nursing!,"I took Unisom before I knew I was pregnant and then read that the active ingredient, doxylamine succinate, has been linked to birth defects, including oral and cleft palate and missing limbs (!!!) I spent months in total terror (baby is ok, fortunately). It can also be dangerous if a mom who breastfeeds takes it and her baby has apnea. So don't take it if you're pregnant or nursing!"
3,Wonderful Book!,"I really loved reading this book. I am a korean who grew up making and eating korean foods, so I am always happy to get a new korean cookbooks whenever it becomes available. I just wish that this book have some color pictures in it. Also, I have tried several receipes in this book, but foods that I had eaten with korean families and eaten in korean restaurants in korea was much better. For example, I had made green onion kimchee (which is one of my favorite kimchee beside radish kimchee) from this book several weeks ago, which had really strong taste of green onions. I had eaten green onion kimchee in korea from my korean family and from our family friends' homes, and green onion kimchee was delicious and did not have that strong green onion taste. No matter which korean cookbooks are sold in america out there (which I own plenty of), it seems none of the cookbooks can create the foods that I had growing up in korea."
5,eating korean,"This cookbook not only teaches you how to cook Korean food but is also entertaining as well. Yes, it may not be a book on all things Korean, but it gives you the essential and traditional recipes. It has personal anecdotes and they're quite amusing. I'm glad I got this book. Almost all the recipes are easy to follow."
4,More than just a recipe collection,I like this book and flip through it quite often looking for inspiration. Beginners probably won't find it that useful as there are very few illustrations but most foodies will enjoy it. The author recounts memories from early life as they relate to food and so the book is more than just a bare recipe collection; it is eminently readable as well. I particularly like it because it provides a lot of simple recipes for the 'basics' and also gives a pretty good selection of make-ahead side dishes.
5,Wonderful Memories,"This is a great cookbook that brings back wonderful memories of my own childhood! The recipes are easy to follow and the explanations are clear. I really enjoyed the photos that made it so personal! This book really inspires me to cook more Korean food. Excellent job, Ms. Lee!"
2,eating korean,I prefer books that show you the pictures of the recipes and also not as much of their family background but more choice of recipes.
1,And Your Life Story is ......,"If you like Maya Angelou's cookbook, you'll like this. Otherwise, keep searching for a cookbook that actually gives you recipes. Because that is what you are really looking for, right?This book should be under autobiographies."
4,Great Background,"This is an excellent cookbook, albiet one written by a Korean-American. Like most younger Korean-Americans, she has toned down the fire. This is not a problem because almost all of her dishes can be heated up or energized by adding ground Korean Chilli Pepper. She gives excellent background on the dishes and this book is one of the best Korean Cookbooks I have seen in English. The only other comment I have is that she like many young people adds a bit too much sugar for my taste in her recipes."
3,So-so,"This book has a lot of recipes that come to mind when one thinks of Korean food. Some of the recipes are good, however, some are just bad. It's a hit-or-miss kind of a book. For example, the recipe for pinenut porridge, that was a disaster. My mom, who was born and raised in Korea who is a lauded cook, tasted the food I made and she was like, what is this? Also, the fried chicken recipe was not good at all. However, the bulgogi recipe is good. So as I stated, some are good (however, not excellent), while others are just plain BAD. I would just go ahead and buy a book that has more consistently."
5,Nobel Worthy Book!,The alternatingly touching and huh-larious stories Lee recounts of her growing up in Korea provide the perfect context for her easy-to-follow and scrumptious recipes. Each one I've tried was delicious -- almost as if a master chef had made them herself. Genius!
4,Very Lightweight Rain Suit,"I have used my rain suit loads of times. For some reason, the bum of my pants is always wet after riding my bike while the ground is wet. I use the rain jacket and the rain pants, and the jacket comes below the top of the pants. The rain is not coming from the top of the pants and leaking down. I have observed that much. It seems to be coming from the seam; but when I inspect the seam, it appears intact. It's kind of a mystery to me. Othan than at my bum, it does keep the rain out very well and is also a very good shield from the wind. I like the suit very much. It is very lightweight and portable and works very well, but I had to downgrade from 5 stars for the wet-bum issue."
5,Great for older dogs,"Attractive with fairly sturdy construction. The additional height makes it easier for larger, older dogs to get at water and food bowls. Stainless steel bowls clean easily."
4,Old Wilbur Loves It!,"The stand is nice! will likely remount the legs on a custom top to match kitchen floor and cabinets. would be a good chance to increase the bowl size two. Bowls are almost the two quarts they claim, but functionally they have a working volume of 1.5 qts. And Old Wilbur thinks he is a camel, so that means the bowls must both be filled with water between meals.... No big deal - would buy again, just the next size up!"
1,Material used for this product is POOR!,"I bought this for my 5 month old Bullmastiff puppy. It is WAY smaller than it seems. Aside from that the ""Oak"" laminate came off after a few weeks. Now she is 6 months old and it is way way to small and it looks ugly. It's composite wood. Not sturdy. I would NOT recommend this to a friend."
2,Misleading,"Don't be misled by the ""3 adjustable sizes"". This means the height goes from about 1 inch to about 3 inches. I got this for my golden retriever and laughed until I cried when I opened the box. FOR SMALL DOGS ONLY!!"
3,a bit wobbly!,"This is not the most stable product. It is nice because you can adjust the height, but it wobbles. I use it for a vacation place and not full time. If you are looking for a sturdy every day feeding setup, this is not it."
4,Perfect Height for 70 Pound Lab,I bought the adjustable feeder for my 70 pound black lab to help make his dinner easier to digest. The shortest setting is the perfect height for him and the bowls are more than large enough. I probably could have gotten the size smaller as the 3 quart bowls are huge. The product looks nice in my kitchen and it was shipped already assembled. I also like that the bowls are dishwasher safe.
3,Lacking in quality,"This product is ok but the biggest complaint I have is that the stainless steel bowls are very thin and lightweight causing them to move around and make noise when my dog eats. The bowls do not fit securely in place. I bought two, one is a 2 quart diner and my dog is clearly not thrilled with the bowl banging around. If a heavier bowl were used that would solve the problem. The 1 quart bowls are the same low quality and I'm disappointed about this. The stand itself is ok, we'll see how long it lasts. I wasn't intending to have to buy another set of bowls but meal time is supposed to be pleasant for them and the clanking and moving around of the bowls is annoying for them. Not sure I would buy this product again unless bowls were upgraded. I have three dogs but won't buy another of this type."
2,"Poor packaging, wobbly legs, but will do.","When I received this, the inside box containing the item was broken in several places with the metal poking through the box. There was no set-up, which was nice but the legs are quite wobbly. I wish there was a way to fix this but I cannot seem to find one. All in all, the 'diner' will do for us and our dog is much happier now (after her first night with it) that she is not eating off the floor. I really enjoy that this design is not bulky and takes up minimal space. I hope it remains in tact and there are no further issues."
3,Regular...,I bought the pro Posture to give it to my son's dog. The dishes are excellent and also the adjustment of the legs. Unfortunately the wood's surface has risen.
3,Okay,"This product is mediocre. The paint peels off really badly when it gets wet, which, since it's designed to hold a bowl of water, will inevitably happen. Looked great when I first bought it, but after several months, it looks pretty bad. Will be getting rid of this and replacing it with a different product."
1,Not what I thought it would be,"This product is very unsteady at the tallest setting for my Golden Retriever. Also, I found BOTH bowls right out of the box with a dent on each corner bottom. I have always been a fan of Amazon, but lately everything I have ordered from this website has either been dented, broke, or doesn't work after a short period of time. I thought everything was to be new, I am starting to think I am buying used, or defective products."
3,Decent,"I Got this product for my large lab who is aging and can't bend over to eat off the ground any more. It does this task very well, and could be adjusted to fit nearly any mid sized to large dog. It looks nice and seems pretty well built. The bowls move around just a little but not enough to really make a difference. I would have given more stars BUT when the product came it had a pretty big scratch in the wood and one of the legs was missing the pin to keep it locked in place. I made it work, but for a new product it should show up nearly flawless in my opinion. Otherwise it was well worth the money and I am thinking about purchasing another similar product for my other lab."
5,HAPPY PUPPY,THIS PET SET IS PERFECT. WE HAVE A NEW CHOW PUPPY AND SHE WAS GETTING HER FOOD AND WATER ALL OVER HER NECK. BY ELIVATING HER FOOD DISHES THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED. NOW AS SHE GROWS WE CAN RAISE IT WITH HER HEIGHT. GREAT IN HOUSE PRODUCT.THANKSJERRY HOOSIER
5,Love the bag love the shoes love it,"Obviously trying to write a biography of a city is a daunting task and you can't include everything, nor go into huge amounts of detail. This book is nonetheless masterful, with just the right amounts of information on the various events in the history of Paris. I can't speak highly enough of this book - informative and enjoyable to read."
3,Interesting history but hard to follow,I was hoping that this would be a history of paris the city but it really is a history of that part of france with many references to cities and Areas that If you don't know France already they make no sense. It seems badly translated with many Grammatical errors and there are also many many quotes in french that is you don't speak French don't make sense. It does give you some great insights to how paris was through the ages but is is a hard book to get through sometimes.
4,Massive History of a Vastely Interesting City,"Alistair Horne has taken on a large task in telling the tale of the city of Paris from the Middle Ages until the fall of de Gaulle. The job is divded into the Seven Ages of Paris to create more bite-size morsels for the reader but it is the character of the city and the characters within the city which make spanning the centuries so much fun. The author includes most of the bloody bits of the history (and with Paris, there was much of that) but also pauses to brings in elements of the arts and culture, particularly in the wonderful sections detailing the past hundred and fifty years. The architecture of the city is told in great detail and may be of interest to some readers, primarily those who have seen Paris. This book was a joy. The author touched on all the important periods and, though a favourite personality may be missing here or there, makes it an interesting read for everyone."
2,Mistitled and disappointing,"The trouble with Alistair Horne's ""Seven Ages of Paris"" is the set of expectations it raises and then fails to deliver upon. Naturally, when picking up a history of a given city, I expect to get a narrative that concentrates on the subject. But too much of this book is taken up by generalized history of the French nation, with only incidental discussion of the impact of wider events on the capital. Admittedly, France has become such a centralized nation in recent centuries that it is tempting to take country and city as intimately intertwined. Yet I'm not sure this was always true.The book is also oddly stingy with illustrations and maps. The growth of Paris would seem to present all sorts of opportunities for vivid illustration (check out the Musee Carnavalet in the Marais for several hundred candidates for inclusion), but all we get here is a few sparse city maps and a few pages of glossy pictures."
2,Disappointing,This vacuum certainly cleans your carpets however I was disappointed that it doesn't clean right to the edges and the on board tools are always falling out. Now after less than two years of use the connections are so worn that the brushes no longer rotate. Needless to say I'm very disappointed. I chose a canister so that I could clean under beds with ease. Now I suppose I'll have to make do with an upright. I won't buy this brand though (my friend did that and it lasted an ever shorter time than this one.)
2,Disappointing,"This vacuum certainly has some power (when I first got it I was amazed at the amount it picked up) but it's a shame that the brush head doesn't clean right to the edge. I was continually irritated by the ""on board"" attachments refusing to do just that. In the end I took one of the brushes out but then of course I never used it again.I can't reccommend this vacuum because after less than two years of use the connections are broken and the brushes no longer rotate. I can only use it for the wooden floors now."
2,Great on carpets only,"My house is 50% carpets and 50% bare floors. On one side, this vaccum perfoms wonderfully on carpets, giving them a ""fresh"" and new look. On the other side, I was very disappointed by its performance on hard wood floors, tilles, and kitchen liners. Terrible! This thing doesn't even pick up a cherrios or a grain of rice!Too much money for a non-versatile vaccum."
1,Looks great! Falls apart quick...,"I have owned this vacuum for three years, so my review is realistic. The first month, the cord reel broke. The wheels which are just pressed on fall off constantly. I just push them back on. The cord is very short which requires you to change outlets constantly. The hose is very flimsy and kinks frequently. You lose suction when the container is about half full. The vacuum has these tiny wheels in the front which cause the unit to tip over when you try and pull it along. Sometimes I got so irratated I just leave it flipped over and keep working. Today it quit running which is good news for me. I can go out and get something reliable..."
1,Not what I expected for the money.,"I was impressed with the pick up power of this vacuum. I've had mine for three years and had to take it in to be repaired in the first year because an overheat fuse. That was repaired under the warrantee. Shortly after the warrantee ran out the neck on the power head broke we superglued it together and have had to do so several times. Cleaning it out is not that convient I have to empty the canister more than once whenever I vacuum our 1600sf home with wall to wall carpeting, and the canister doesn't clean completely without washing. The hepa filter is expensive to replace. I'll replace the vacuum before putting any more money into this, and I be sure to check the reviews before buying another vacuum. There has got to be something better than this out there."
4,A great value for the dollars spent,"I recently purchased a Fantom Lightning on the advice from my wife, who keeps up to date with research and use of household products. She had followed the Fantom line of products over a year ago, and simply putting it, we could not afford a ""Fantom Lightning"" vacuum, .... We purchased ours ...(Brand New) at Amazon.com a few Months ago and the results are great. We noticed a great improvement in carpet cleanliness, over and above the ""Panasonic"" model we were using. The cannister requires no bags, and cleans carpets and floors, without leaving reside or ""Second hand dirt"". We are definitely satisfied with this marvelous product and highly recommend it for those requiring a vacuum that does it all.Don."
2,Works well but..,It works fine but it keeps breaking. I have had it for 1 year now and set it to the shop 3 times.
1,Don't expect to get replacement parts,I've had this vacuum for just over a year and it's already stopped working. First the wand broke and there's no way to get another one. I've tried all over. Fantom said they were no longer being made because of a defect! That's why I need a new one. Now it's just stopped working. I would never put this much money into a vacuum the company won't stand behind.
1,Worst product I've owned,"I have never had a worse vacuum. It is supposed to keep odors out, instead it redistributes the odors each time you vacuum-(thats after replacing the...hepa filter after only a year).The hose that connects to the canister continually comes off as you move with the vacuum. The on/off button has sprung off. If that is not enough, there is too much work that needs to be done each time you vacuum, such as:emptying out the canister.cleaning the filter out every vacuum.The bagless vacuum (at least this one) is not, in any way, convenient."
1,Good & Bad,I did like my fantom sweeper very much but it did break the 1st year I had it and I think when they fixed it they made it worse than it was. Now the swivel broke and it can't even be glued. I did find out that Fantom is in Chapter 11. You can find parts for it at [website].
2,"10,000 Rabbit Trails","This is a very fine translation of one of the most important books from the ancient world. Be forewarned, this is not easy reading for the ordinary or casual reader of history. The university level teacher or classical scholar will savor every page. Herodotus does not give you a simple narrative. He starts you out and then runs you down ten thousand rabbit trails so you may forget where you started and where you were trying to go. He introduces names and places in a staggering volume in just a few pages. He will introduce a person and then tell you all about his great grandfather,grandfather,father,mother,siblings, every person he killed and every woman he ever slept with. He goes to great length to tell you how the Greeks chose their commanding general at the Battle of Marathon but he gives you sparse detail about how they actually won that famous conflict. The breadth of people and events Herodotus covers is huge but the pathway is not linear."
4,Deport Laporte,I bought this book solely based on the fact that Leo wrote it. Leo has got to be the coolest geek in the world. I like this book because the structure is unique. Each day of the calendar year Leo gives a new tidbit of information so you can start your day with something new for the whole year. Keep in mind this book is mainly for beginning computer users. Most advanced users will not get much out of this book. I liked it though because it's Leo and he's funny and writes like he runs his shows. I did learn a thing or two as well. Definitely a must have for the Leo fan and the beginning to intermediate computer enthusiast.
5,leos almanac,"Even if you are really geeky, you are bound to learn something from this book . There is so much stuff. Its like having a years worth of tips and ideas he has on his techtv show crammed into one book. Some stuff I knew, but learning shortcuts and such I didnt know made it well worth it. One dea can save lots of time money or aggravation. Good bathroom reading too. In his next years book perhaps the publisher will splurge and do color on the inside pages, making it easier to seperate different sections and types of information , but dont let that stop you from learning somethings you don't know. Get it."
5,Awesome,"Poor Leo's 2002 Computer Almaqnac is a must read, there is so much information. Just the little things make a big difference. This book has taught me alot, and I still pick it up and thumb through it and find something new. I cannot wait for the 2003 edition, as I have heard it will be bigger, and better. Leo keep up the GREAT work, think geek!"
1,DOn't waste your time,"When I ordered, the book had a different cover. Was looking for a forestry review book, but when I got into it, so much stuff was outdated and virtually worthless. Book had a copyright date of 1922. Don't know how much I paid, maybe nothing (Kindle), but even nothing is too much, due to the time wasted trying to go through it. I'd rate it as a minus 5 stars. For me, I think Amazon ought to be ashamed of itself for offering such a book. At least the new offering gives more of a clue as to how out-of-date the book is. I'd say more, but I've got to figure out how to delete this...............book from my kindle."
4,The most coherent Anthony Marsiglia movie.,"The only conceit is her otherworldly naivete. There aren't male characters played by hot women or animals played by balls of hair and at no time should you suddenly realize that you have no idea what is happening, two gripes I have with Lust For Dracula and Sinful(Mine). Chantal makes sense. You can see how the scene you are watching follows from the scenes before. And they lead someplace; you don't just end up there. The whole female portion of the cast is yummy, which really is what sells these frisbees, but in the case of Chantal, the story is good too. With these Seduction Cinema titles, you can't always say that."
2,Very old school soft porn - not what I exepcted,Very old school soft porn - not what I exepcted from the description. I doubt I will revisit the actress or the series
5,"An unforgetable book, I've used it's priciples since school.","This book was the single most valuable book which I ever read, since it explains how people distort agruments through emotions. The book clearly explains what is happening and then teaches you how to handle the situation."
5,"Concise, much of substance and very usuable.",The single most useful book dealing with the techniques of discussion and argumentation that I've read. Still use its principles 10 years later !. Good to know what professional persuaders (politicians etc.) have in their armoury.
5,"Readable, handy info for those who engage in debate","This book deals with situations where we sabotage ourselves with crooked thinking and how we can arrive at reasonable and sane conclusions by reducing arguments down to the facts, especially around controversial areas as politics, religion and morals. It also tells how to innoculate oneself from other people's crooked thinking or unscrupulous intent. Interesting are the thirty-eight dishonest tricks which are commonly used in argument and the methods of overcoming them."
1,"too long, too late",The time it takes to get to your door doesn't justify any lower price. Next time I buy a simple product like this I will drive to the nearest store. (it took 14 days for a $5.00 item !!)
1,Please Do Not Buy,"I have purchased this for my Nokia 6650(AT&T),and it does not fit. I am sure it does not fit most of the models it says it does! If you have a flip phone like mine the chances of NOT fitting are very high. Its extremely low price tag might be tempting, but it is not worth the shipping you pay, Stay away!"
3,"Just a fun, crunchy li'l ditty...","I don't remember how I stumbled across Strata, but one day, their track ""When It's All Burning"" magically appeared in my Winamp playlist. That song is, quite simply, a polished, slick modern rock track with breathless vocals. From it, I guessed that their music could go in a couple of directions: it could be something bothered and searing like, say, Matthew Good; it could also be just a radio-friendly watering-down of heavy bands from which Strata take influence. Unfortunately, we got the later on the full-length.If you just want a rock CD, well, this fits the bill and fills the void. If you're looking for something challenging or expansive, though, look elsewhere. Regardless, it's not bad for a debut; maybe on later releases they'll come into their own."
2,Mediocre ... at best,"Before I listened to this album, I had already heard it. It's the same generic garbage as is all over the radio (Papa Roach, Chevelle, Evans Blue, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus; yes, they're all generic too). The songs on this album have such mind-blowing choruses as ""You were never there, you were never there"". Wow, I'll never be the same after hearing that. Two stars only because it's better than hip hop."
4,These Guys Will Go Places,Awesome album i just purchased a few days and can't stop listening to it. I love how they switch up from soft to hard rock in the middle of a song. If you ever get a chance to go see these guys do it. I saw them at the HOB in north myrtle beach last wk and they def rocked out peace!
4,They had me within a minute...,"I went to see Finger Eleven over the summer, and I am the type of person to pay absolutely NO attention to opening bands and just throw myself into the pit until the band I came to see comes on. Well then Strata appeared. Not only was the singer gorgeous (noticed that first, hehe), but their shear talent really caught my attention. I went and bought the album not too long after that and was extremely happy I had found out about them through that show. They had great stage presence and sound great live. The CD is really good too, for a band of their experience. I am mostly a listener of Otep, Kittie, etc., but if something softer comes along that is actually original then good, and Strata does just that. Tracks 1, 3, 5, 8 and 12 are my favorites- the music really stands out and the lyrics are well versed. I can't wait to see how awesome Strata gets with a little more experience and albums under their belt. Going to see them in march yet again, can't wait!"
5,There is no Downside in buying this,I've had the pleasure of knowing of this band for quiet a while now. Since before they were even called Strata. They've had these songs around for a while but they improved on them and they sound outstanding. I really hope this band goes a long way. These guys are great and they deserve all the success they can get.
2,BLAH,"I bought this cd because I read awesome reviews for it and because according to Amazon, people who bought Submersed's ""On due time"" also bought this cd...I've given the cd a couple of plays and I just can't get into it. I feel like I'm listening to 30 Seconds to Mars, good, yet boring, lacking chemestry. So far all the songs sound just about the same. There are some good songs in there, but definetively not worth my 13 bucks."
4,Extremely good,"My lord AZ's new album is soo good. I have noticed he has grown and matured a lot from his last album. The two songs that really shine on the album are, ""Problems"" and ""Mo Money, Mo Murder, and Homicide."" In those songs he talks about growing up from a troubled boy in the ghetto to now living large with friends and family. I bought the album the day it came out and I'm still listening to it over and over. When you listen to his album you can tell the difference between him and all the other cats in the game. His voice is rough and smooth which is enjoyable to listen to. I can't wait till the videos come out for those songs. Buy this album!!!!!!!!!"
4,Wonderful Pre-Trip Read,"Finished reading my PR guide last night. I truly enjoyed learning more about PR's history and culture. One thing I particularly loved about this 'guide' were the beautiful color photos that you won't find in most other books on PR. This guide is not something that can help you plan out the details of your trip, but it is a nice base to determine specific areas you'd like to see during your visit. We'll be using our Fodor's guide to pick out restaurants and other activities. 16 more days to go..."
5,Sacred Chants of Buddha,This is one of the most beautiful CD I have ever listen to.It is a must to have. Beautiful in every way. You life will be tansform by it. I will keep it for ever.
2,Impossible to change cartridge,"This faucet was in the house I bought, and has been leaking. I had an easy time replacing the cartridge to the Moen faucet in my downstairs bathroom so I thought this would also be easy--nope. Buying the cartridge was easy, finding the ""special tool"" was fruitless unless I want to wait to order it online. Nevermind buying this special tool--my faucet has a plastic retainer nut, which is what the tool would have been used to remove--it is so stuck the tool wouldn't have done a thing--imagine using metal to remove a stuck piece of plastic. So, right now the retainer nut is stripped and mangled because I had to beat the crap out of it and I'm wondering if in my efforts to fix the thing I'll be buying a new faucet."
4,"Neo-Soul United, Vol 2 - actually 4.5 stars","This is an excellent compilation disc! More than the first Neo-Soul United offering, every single track introduced me to new singers with georgeous voices and excellent musical production.After a few spins, my favorite tracks are:MAKE LOVE LAST FOREVER - Michael Bohannon (very Marvin Gaye-esque; beautiful voice & music)SPIRIT - Theresa Morton (neo-soul gospel at its finest)LITTLE THINGS - Dan MetreyeonIF I NEED TO MOVE ON - Ladybug MeccaUTOPIA - Keith RobinsonLAST TEAR - LisalaIf you like neo-soul and are interested in hearing some new voices, I'd highly recommend getting this disc over the previous one - this one is less eclectic and more straight-forward soul."
3,"cape breton highlands area, grossly neglected....","After doing my homework on the internet and searching for areas of great hiking in Nova Scotia,I came across the Cape Breton Highlands National Park area, the Cabot trail scenic drive, etc...and although I understand that the author/hiker wanted to include all regions of Nova Scotia in his book, I was terribly disappointed to see that there are only five hikes mentioned from the Cape Breton Island area. To be honest, I was able to retrieve much more info, simply by doing searches on the internet. L'Acadien, Skyline trail, Corney Brook, Coastal trail, and many more of what seem to be the most significant hikes in this area; were all left out of this book. On the positive side, it seems to include many great details about the wildlife in the area, the topo maps look like they will be helpful, and and directions to the trailheads seem thorough."
2,Woefully short on info,"I bought this book before our recent vacation to Nova Scotia, where we spent most of our trip on Cape Breton Island. This book covers only a small fraction of the available trails. We did ""Middle Head"" (which is covered in the book), but, at the suggestion of the ranger at the National Park information center, we also did Franey Mountain (just a short distance from Middle Head) and Skyline (on the other side of the park), both of which were more substantial and rewarding and not even mentioned in the book.Save the cost of the book and stop by a visitor information center or National Park information center. You'll hear about a lot more choices."
1,"DON""T!",Buy the dvd version only! Amazon is allowing this rip off to be sold. I don't know why-it's a piss pour copy from old tape and has no sound track! How could you even allow this dreck?
2,disappointing Fox musical,"I am a huge fan of the Fox musicals of the 1930s, 1940s and some from the 1950s - especially those starring Alice Faye, Sonja Henie, Betty Grable, Carmen Miranda and Marilyn Monroe. The Girl Next Door features two talented and pleasant stars in Dan Dailey and June Haver and the color looks great, but the songs, the dance routines and the cartoon sequences are surprisingly uninspired. Add Dennis Day to the mix, and the film suffers even more. I never understood his appeal. When I think of Dan Dailey, Mother Wore Tights and When My Baby Smiles At Me comes to mind. June Haver shines in The Dolly Sisters, I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now and Look For The Silver Lining (at Warners). With great musicals as these waiting for release, I wonder why this minor effort made it to DVD? I guess it's worth watching if you truly love movie musicals, but I can't imagine ever sitting through it again."
1,The most horrible DVD EVER!!!!!!,"I am a big J-Lo fan, no matter what people think of her, I thought this DVD was going to be like VH1's Behind the Music you know a well put together behind the scene look at her. It was behind the scene alright, and horrible. It was like some highschool kids put together some pictures of J-lo from magazines and just displayed them across the screen to some horrible back drop music. I was so upset and disappointed for wasting a DIME on this DVD. It is 60 minutes long but I fell asleep after 15. I cannot even believe Amazon would advertise such a horrible and boot leg project, this DVD does not tell you anything we don't already know or read about her. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY I DON'T WANT YOU TO BECOME THE NEXT VICTIM. Whoever made this should be paying us to watch it.....HORRIBLE!!!!"
3,jenny from the block,"I am looking to buy new or used, 'JENNY FROM THE BLOCK "" music viedo, with Ben with her. Also the music video with Marc Anthony the spanish song any idea"
1,I don't know if this is any good or not,"But who cares? It's gota great cover. What? You were expecting depth, revelation, the holy grail? It looks like eye candy to me..."
4,The O/D Saxon Songs Crank !!,"Well....while i was hoping for a full fledged ""Oliver Dawson Saxon"" studio release,i guess this will have to do.""Second Wave"" is a compilation album from ""Girlschool"",""Tygers Of Pan Tang"" and ""O/D Saxon"",celebrating the anniversary of the NWOBHM.All of the bands do pretty well with their respective material,especially the ""O/D Saxon"".Graham and Steve have put together a d*mn good line-up with this band -along with Haydn,John and Nigel they kick a ton of ass on these newer songs.I don't wanna hear the ""this is a sub-par Saxon cash-in, imitation,rip-off"" crap argument either! I love ""Saxon"",but c'mon if you listen to O/D Saxon and can't appreciate them,you don't like metal ...This gets a 4 and not a 5 just for the mere fact that ""Girlschool"" should have surrendered their set to ODS and let em' put a few more on there . Crank It !"
3,NWOBHM still alive....,"I stumbled upon this one surfing around. I always had an interest in Tygers of Pan Tang, as John Sykes used to play with them in the early days. I bought this disc for the Tygers material, but the reunion Saxon tracks arent bad at all. They have a bit of old Savatage/early Metal Church (David Wayne era) feel to them. Girlschool I wasnt familiar with."
3,'Second Wave' (Communique Records) Various Artists,"A twelve track split CD(I guess one could call this release).Here,you get four(4)cuts each from the 'New Wave Of British Heavy Metal' artists Oliver-Dawson Saxon and some previously unreleased material from Girlschool and Tygers Of Pan Tang.I only borrowed a copy of this CD from a friend,and WON'T be interested in getting my own copy.Not really a bad compilation,but pretty much aimed toward the die-hard fans.The music here is maybe nothing to write home about,but okay."
5,Magical -- a Feast for the Eyes and Mind,"I'd never seen a live Cirque du Soleil performance, so I expected some fine, but predictable acrobatics and sets. Nothing in this beautiful production is ordinary or predictable, and the decision to shoot it as an IMAX 3-D film was necessary to capture the essence of these fine actors and gymnasts. The 3-D experience combined with the exquisite performances are very powerful, and I saw many people in tears after the show.The only dissapointment is that the movie ends too soon!"
4,"Great, but to short","The best video production of a Cirque de Soleil I have ever seen. The reason it gets 4 stars, because it's only 32 minutes long. I was still on my popcorn as the movie ended. It felt that the producers robed me. This DVD should have been called a trailer but not the whole feature. Otherwise it's so beautiful that I had to play it again. A word to the producers, please release part 2, and make it this time at least an hour long, let me finish my popcorn."
3,Poor video quality on older shows,"The early shows are almost unwatchable because the video quality is so poor. The content is really dated too. The music, costumes and acts are nothing like the modern shows. Starting with Drallion (1999) things got much better. In this time period, they didn't start using too many harnesses and safety devices. Moving forward in time, there is a noticable increase in safety gear which protects the performers but detracts from the overall experience.I'd say 5 of the 12 DVDs are pretty good. The others are really poor quality even when up-converted to 1080i."
2,Not as expected,We have seen many Cirque shows & this one was not nearly as interesting as the live shows. The 3D effects weren't very good either.
1,Instant view is not what it seems,"I'm a big fan of Cirque du Soleil, so I hate to leave a bad review. I'm sure this collection is amazing, but after purchasing this collection on instant view, I'm saddened to realize that what I actually bought was ONE 38 minute long video, and NOT the collection. Definitely not worth the $10. I could have bought the DVD for less. True, this was the first time I'd ever purchased an instant view title, and I see now that it says ""Journey of Man"" (the movie that you ACTUALLY get), but I'm a long-time amazon user and like every other order I've ever placed (with no problems), I expected to get the item that I'm looking at, not something else.In short, just be aware that if you buy this collection for instant view, you're just getting a 38 minute video, NOT the 12 disc collection that the listing is for. LAME."
2,Not worth it!,"This movie was well worth the NYC $10 I paid to see it in the IMAX theater. However, that was because it was in 3D!!! It was beautifully amazing with 3D glasses and for $10 I didn't mind that it was only 40 minutes long. But this is definitely not worth the money you pay on here, unless they give you 3D glasses with it and you can see it how it should be seen!"
1,Do Not Buy,This blu-ray disc does not play on my LG 3D blu-ray player. To date I have about twenty 3D titles on blu-ray and this is the only one that does not work properly. I tried it also on my pioneer blu-ray burner and it did not play properly. The quality of the blu-ray disc seems much cheaper than the others that I have - disc is very flimsy.
2,I Feel I Have Been Taken Advantage Of,"Until I purchased a packet of two Cirque du Soleil DVDs, I had only seen it on television. Since I was always impressed by the professionalism, beauty and originality of their productions, I was really disappointed with this DVD. When I got home and read that it was only thirty some minutes long, I thought I had misread it and read it again. In my opinion, the show was also very boring in spots, especially the underwater ballet. The acrobats were fantastic and I was sorry to see their act end."
5,Great quakity DVD of fabulous perfromaces,"Beautifully photographed and edited Cirque Du Soliel performances. A must have set for any home entertainment collection. With an HD TV, it is an overwhelming experience. Different from being there personally, but equally as enthralling."
1,Disappointed,"I am a Cirque du Soleil fan and waited eagerly for the release of the Journey of Man. With the hype and previews, I expected this one to outshine the recent others. Much to my dismay, not only was it about half as long, but had only two acts I considered equal to their reputation.Much of the time was taken up with scenes and music that are common to many a movie/performance. I normally love the story lines that accompany the performances, but this one spent way too much of the already short time on ""nothing"".The two performances that were worth veiwing were still not enough to make me want to keep the video. I sent it back."
2,Disappointing - not the actual circus show,"I bought this right after getting my first 3D television, thinking it was a full circus show, as seen on some PBS stations.No.It is an all too short, choppy 'story' about someone growing up, and to be honest, only part of it is even 'circusy' in nature.Overall, a pretty big disappoitnment for those expecting the real Cirque du Soleil experience."
4,Journey of Man (A Great 3D Bluray!),"Our family members are Cirque du Soleil fans. We all enjoyed watching Journey of Man in 3D high-def. It was short, but well done, and the 3D was fantastic! Journey of Man is now one of our better 3D examples to be showing off to our friends."
3,"good 3D, very short show","This dvd is 35 minutes, more like an adverising for what it can be..Rent you can, not worth the full dvd price"
3,50% GOOD~~~50%BAD.....,"I have to say that this set is in short terms one half good and one half not so good. It is good in the start and moving on.....then slowly starts to stray away from the Cirque we all love......the worst in MY opinion was the last one (a one-time performance...luckily)""Midnight Sun"" ACK!!! There were no costume efforts, and there were no acts or performances we are used to. Just a cheap show for the International Jazz Festival. Now granted...these performers can perform WAY better than myself...not taking anything away from them...but when you are used to the extraordinary...the simple does not cut it. I felt the performances should IMPROVE...not evaporate."
3,Not terribly impressed,This was okay for a one time viewing but will proably not be watching it again. I was expecting more amazing artistic and acrobatic feats than what is delivered here.
2,Might be good on movie screen but not a home screen,"I was NOT impressed with the 3D in most areas largely because they had the camera zoomed out so far that even on a good size home TV (55in) the images are small and unimpressive. While many good 3D movies might have long shots in 3D, normally they will mix it up and often zoom in to close up shots. I can see why this might be a good movie for effects on IMAX screens, but it is one of the least impressive I have bought for a home TV. Without the visual images to engage you, the movie does become pretty boring."
4,Good,"This collection is good, has the most of the videos and some of them are very good, are videos that cannot miss in your house, but it would be excellent if it included the special shows."
5,Amazing!,"This DVD is amazing, the visual effects, the performance of the artist, colors and the music. This DVD is a ""must have"" in your collection. If you don't have any of the dvd's of the Cirque du Soleil is a great buy the 3 pack (Journey of man, Dralion and Quidam) those 3 are great!"
5,Awesome Cirque Video,"""Journey of Man"" is the quintessential Cirque du Soleil production. This is the definitive Cirque containing all of the elements that make every Cirque show brilliant: stunning gymnastics and acrobatics, vivid colors, emotive music and the simple message of life from birth to beyond. A ""must-see""."
3,Fine,"We sincerely expect a lot more than video, is very good but very short on time and history fell short"
4,Fco. L. saprissa,"Very interesting and entertaining, I think for young people is a good distraction, have a clear picture on BD but I think that the presentation is a bit short for what you pay for."
4,Good 3D DVD but has technical problems,"The story content is a bit esoteric and underlying vision development requires patience on the part of the viewer but the performances are unworldly. The 3D cinematography was spot on as you would expect from Cirque. I'd give it 5 stars except for the short length. I did have trouble, as did other reviewers, with getting it to work on any of my DVD players - 2D or 3D. Even the third copy sent only works on my 3D player though Sony proclaims it can be played in 2D. Perhaps, they meant it can be played in 2D mode on a 3D player. Anyway, If I could give 10 stars to Amazon Customer Service I would. They replaced the first two defective discs by overnight delivery no questions asked. Kudos to the best customer service department of any out there. I usually place my orders with Amazon direct even though their price may be a little higher than that offered by other sites. The experience with this affirms that choice. Thank you Amazon!"
1,Very poor effort for Cirque,"Let's start by saying that I love Cirque, and all of their live shows. I wish this was one of them. Instead, it's a very short kid's show, and a boring one at that. It has none of the pizazz of one of their live shows, and left me wanting something, well, anything else. Really, if you're going to put out a 3D blu ray, it should be your best material, not your worst...Next time, put a real show on 3D blu ray!"
5,Good 3D Effects,Wanted DVD's in 3D and this was one that I chose. Glad I did. Effects were quite good and as usual Cirque de Soleil performance outstanding. Looking for good 3D effects this DVD will not disappoint!
1,I love CDS. I hate this DVD,"At the opposite of the C.D.S. spirit. This DVD sounds like an old fashion Hollywood film. They tried to use SFX, but that's really too much and we can't enter the adventure.There are only 3 real performances, one from Quidam, one from saltimbanco.The esthetic of the film sounds like plastic. Really too expensive. Uninteresting. Keep your money or let's buy the dvd of saltimbanco, alegria or quidam."
2,Cannot view in 3-D?,"I was able to watch it in 2-D but not 3-D. I have a Samsung 9000 series 3-D HDTV and a Samsung 3-D player. Oddly the Menu is in 3-D but the ""you need a 3-D capable TV and player"" message keeps popping up no matter what I put the settings on. Very Frustrating to say the least."
2,Poor Presentation,"I was terribly disappointed in this book. I teach construction law at a community college and was assigned to use this book my first semester. I'll not use it again. The organization of the information was questionable. Many statements contained in the book were flat wrong or presented only a misrepresentative portion of a bigger picture. Many key topics were completely unaddressed. I can say that where the book is correct, the information is presented in plain English and provides the student with useable information about the basics."
4,undercover angel,this is really good it has a great story to it. another good film with yasmine bleeth in is road rage.
5,Great and entrtaining,"This movie brings great entertainment to the whole family, you will enjoy laughs and crys it's delightful!"
4,Broken CD case,"I really enjoy this CD. Brings back memories. However, when I received this, the case was broken. The CD is fine though. I have since put it in a new case and all is well. But so you know maybe better packaging for mailing is needed in the future. Of course, I will continue to buy my CD's from Amazon.Thanks, Amazon."
1,Pages out of order,"I have ordered two copies of this book. Both have had pages significantly out of order (the ""first"" page is actually 146, and the table of contents turns up half way through the book)."
1,"If you know basic writing principles, this book is not for you.","This book was extremely disappointing. Barzun suggests some writing essentials that I (and most well-educated people, I would assume) learned when I was pretty young. I hoped this book would offer insight and techniques for advancing my writing ability. Instead, it was a slightly more advanced review of what I learned before I entered high school. If you have any substantial training, don't waste your time with this book."
5,One of the Triumvirate,"Barzun has written one of the best guides to prose composition, one to be set on the shelf with Strunk & White's ""Elements of Style"" and Graves & Hodge's ""Reader Over Your Shoulder"" and consulted often. All three of these books adhere to the Strict Taskmaster method and demand that the writer PAY ATTENTION to what he (or she) is doing. Prissy? Perhaps. Overbearing? At times. But such discipline is the first essential step towards becoming a real writer.Only after one has internalized the Taskmasters and made their advice an ingrained habit can one then go on to profit from such excellent books as Joseph Williams's ""Style,"" Thomas Kane's ""Oxford Essential Guide to Writing,"" and Arthur Quinn's ""Figures of Speech""."
3,Review of Simple and Direct: A Rhetoric for Writers,"There were some items that I could take away from reading this book from cover to cover. This was a 'should read' in another book. Perhaps at some later date, I'll reread the book and gain mor insight."
2,Outdated and opinionated,"This old essay doesn't explain much about the religions it cites, but only calls them barbaric. Except for Christianity of course. This piece of writing doesn't so much compare religions as it does bash any that are inferior to Christianity (a.k.a. all the other ones). However, you can't blame the writer - it's a product of its time."
1,Does a book stink in the woods?,"Anyone seeking a copy of this book can have mine. While I enjoyed the author's interesting perspectives on nature and lifestyle, the pace of this book was that of a bear in hibernation. The author is just too zany for his own good. Although he laughs at his mistakes, if he wasn't so clueless he wouldn't make them in the first place. It was when I got to the interminable section where the author battles a lightning storm from atop tree (a highly recommended stunt!) that I realized the book was better served helping to balance my washing machine. And we wonder why this thing is out of print?"
2,TOO EXPENSIVE,I DONT LIKE ALL THE FLAVORS AND THERE WASN'T A LOT FOR THE PRICE I PAID. BUT I AM OUT OF OPTIONS SINCE MOST PLACES DON'T SELL THIS.
2,disappointing - beans were stale,"The order arrived fairly quickly - but I was disappointed because the candy was stale and there were not many ""recipes"" included in the box for mixing the flavours"
2,Wouldn't Do Again,I bougt these for my diabetic girlfriend and they were not the hit I was hoping they'd be. She ate less than half the box in matter of few weeks and threw the rest away. The taste wasn't good and she stated they left an aftertaste. I would not recommend this although I don't know of any sugar-free candy that does taste good.
3,Some flavors work better than others,"Of the ten flavors, only the juicy pear, licorice and sizzling cinnamon are worth eating. The more subtle, pure fruit flavors are spoiled by the hard, chalky shell IMO."
3,Looks good,"I have not used it yet, but the delivery was quick and looks exactly as expected. i hope it works as good as it looks."
1,Wind Chaser Car Humidifier,This item worked great! For the first week then it quit working. This is the second one i've had that have quit working within the first week. Do not buy this product. It's junk!
1,Makes a loud squealing noise!,"I bought this for my office from another website and paid $20 for it. Within minutes of plugging it in it began to make this super high pitch squeal! I tried everything to fix it, with no luck. The whole office would laugh when I turned it on! I agree with the other reviewer....this was junk."
1,unit lasts only for 1-2 hours after refill,"as per the features it supposed to stay for 6- 8 hours, 6-8 hours is a n average trip . but i have to fill this for every two hours."
2,Not recommended,"Unlike most of the other unhappy customers, my product worked TOO GOOD. What was supposed to be a vapor mist was way too wet and not a mist at all but rather a wet almost stream of moisture that got the dashboard, gearshift and everything else near the unit sopping wet; the mist was too dense to be effective as a humidifier that is designed to relieve dry air throughout the vehicle. Thus, this unit was of no value for me."
1,save your money,"The first one of these lasted a week. the company was good enough to send me another one, which lasted 3 days, then stopped.I do not need a third one to tell you this is junk. Please save your money."
2,Display Weight?,"The description shows an item weight of 21 lbs, but a shipping weight of 5-ish lbs. So it is misleading. Please correct"
5,"Beautiful Melodies, Great Playing","This is definitely a CD worth checking out. All compositions are originals by Marco and highlite his unique and exceptionally talented nylon-string guitar playing. The rhythms on this album vary from a jazz waltz to an upbeat samba to a very ""hot"" baiao. While the peices demonstrate the wide range of influences and studies in Marco's background, he always maintains a hold on his Brazilian roots. The talents of the accompanying musicians, including Hans Teuber, Lucas Robatto, Tad Britton and Daniel Carvalho only add to what is a fine instrumental project. If you are a fan of Brazilian jazz, especially Tamba Trio, Jobim, Helio Delmiro or even Villa-Lobos you are sure to enjoy Marco's CD."
3,Stright up JLH nothing fancy....,"Looking for DVD with just music on it. This is it! Song choice is good, video quality is OK. Taking into account the original recording wasn't great. I don't think they had much to work with. If you're a Hooker fan you will like this. Looking for history, stories, guitar riffs, or anything else find it else where."
4,it's a great bible study!,I have ordered 12 of these (11 came from Amazon and included a version for my Kindle). We used them for a great study at church! Really made you see bible stories in a more personal way.
2,Defective,"Overall, this shower curtain is fine. It is exactly the length I needed and it is nice and heavy. However, it is missing a grommet at the top. I could have gone through the whole process of returning it and getting a new one, but I just didn't want to. I did not contact the seller."
2,Dusty Shower Curtain,"Upon unfolding this curtain, it was coated in some sort of powdery substance. I have not had many death threats and am I pretty likable person so I knew it wasn't laced with anthrax. The powder because a slime when it got wet, so cleaning my new shower curtain has been a chore. It is a very long shower curtain."
5,Powerful plot and memorable characterizations.,A man compelled to investigate religious accounts of Jesus' return meets his match in the form of an elderly Brazilian woman who claims to be Jesus. Will the Second Coming be born out of a third-world ghetto and a band of survivors? The plot and characterization are indeed powerful as journalist Mike Mason's pursuit of the truth lands him in political and personal danger in a rapidly changing world.
1,Pendant is nice; Chain is a rip-off,"I am really disgusted with the Cat Pendant that arrived today. I bought it as a gift for someone else, and there is no time to return it and get a replacement before Christmas. The open-work cat pendant is really cute and nicely done, but the chain that it floats on is about as thin as a hair. It would break if someone sneezed on it. When I see something described as a ""rope chain"" I think of something a little more substantial.The necklace arrived in a box wrapped around a slotted, folded envelope stuffed with tissue paper and cushioned with a tiny scrap of bubblewrap. In other words, if you buy this necklace, you will also need to purchase another gift box to present it in because the one that came with the necklace looks like trash.I am really angry to have paid $45 for what was probably worth only $15."
5,jeans,why not get it better prices of the cds because alot people they can't pay that much money so i think its a crazy price for this cds people
4,Law & Gravity,"Never read this author before, however, from the beginning it got to me. It is slightly different than other books I have read about CIA, FBI, etc.I would buy more of his books."
2,Mediocre at best,"You would think that I would praise this book since the author is an acquaintance. However, maybe I have read too many spy novels or legal thrillers but this plot was boring to me. Maybe I should write a book since within the first 20 pages I acurately predicted the plotline and the resulting drama. Looking at the other reviews, maybe to them it wasn't too obivious but since I know the author and I saw the characters and I know a little bit about history--I put it together and there you go. I did miss one twist so I guess it wasn't the worst book I have read but maybe a $4 book(out of $10)."
2,Law of Gravity,"This was a boring book. I had been looking forward to reading it, because I read Horn's first book and liked it very much. It was tight and fresh.This one comes across as the obligatory follow-up to a success; written before the author had anything really new to tell his readers..."
4,A nice surprise,"I bought this at a used book sale without high expectations. When I finally picked it up to read a few months later, I was pleasantly surprised. It's rare that I read a work by an author I've not heard of and think, ""I'll have to look up other things he's written"" but I did with this. The characters may be a little underdeveloped but they are fairly believable, the plot moves along, and there are enough twists to keep you thinking."
3,complaint,"i got the 3 channels. howerver, they seem the wasted items (many scratches on them)how can i order more?"
5,Must Have for Toddlers in the Hose!!,"I LOVE this!! I put one in the kid's bathroom, bedroom, and play room. I used to hate hearing, ""mom - I need you to come turn on the light!!"" always while I was in the middle of cooking or something like that. Then, they would leave the room and the light would stay on because they cannot reach to turn it off. Now they love the independence of being able to turn the light on and off on their own! They have learned to turn it off when they leave the room, saving my energy bill $$! Very easy to install!!"
1,Good idea - terrible execution,"This product is a great idea in concept but it doesn't execute well. First of all, the product didn't fit over my light switch plate. While this wasn't a big investment, I had to go buy a different plate and install the product. Once the product was installed, I never felt it was secured because the screws unscrew with each flip of the switch.The product was up for less than 12 hours before it snapped off in my sons little hand. The plastic is not that great of quality. Not happy at all with this product."
2,wonderful journey!,this is a good sequel to the newberry novel winning book mrs frisby and the rats of nimh but it was not as good and i think the way mrs frisby and the rats of nimh ended there was not supposed to be a sequel so there for i do note rate it well
4,Very good sequel,"This book is a sequel to the excellent ""Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of N.I.M.H."" This second book is not written by the author the first, Robert C. O'Brien: this author is his daughter. Despite that, this is a very creditable sequel to the first book. Fortunately, the poor animated movie sequel to ""The Rats of N.I.M.H."" is *NOT* based on this book. Only minor inconsistencies exist with O'Brien's work. The book generates less of a sense of wonder and mystery, but is nevertheless highly recommended to anyone who enjoyed the first book. The third book in the series, ""R-T, Margaret and the Rats of N.I.M.H."" is not as enjoyable, and I only recommend it to die-hard fans of the Rats of N.I.M.H."
4,NIHM Continued,"This sequel to ""Mrs Frisby and the rats of NIHM"" does not have the brilliance of the original novel, however it is enjoyable and quite touching. The novel's primary character is Mrs Frisby's son, Timothy, and focusses on the Rats in their new home and new society. A good sequel."
1,A shadow of the original,"This entire book was weak, from the characters to the battle against the construction company. I've read better fanfiction than this collection of character archtypes, Racso the Mary Sue, and the stultification of the solid characters that made Mrs. Frisby so rich. The damn builders could have been replaced with any number of ""bad companies out to maim and destroy"" including NIMH."
2,I was disappointed in this sequel.,"Even though I enjoyed this book, I found that it lacked continuity with Robert O'Brien's original book, ""Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH."" The book was an easier read, but it doesn't have the detail that the first book had. I read both aloud to my students. My students all said they liked the original book better."
2,I hated this book,"I am a 5th grader, and recently I was given an assignment to read this book. Earlier in the school year, we read Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh, which was good, but I didn't enjoy it as much since I had read it many times in kindergarten and first grade. The book is boring and fast-paced, and it seems like Jane Leslie Conly has perhaps watered down the writing, perhaps to make it less difficult. The book got considerably better in the end, but still it was poorly written and boring. The plot was actually quite good, but the way everything went so quickly was confusing, and yes, I didn't like it. It was also too long for such a dull book. Usually I would think that 278 pages is short, but the way it drags on, it was a slow read for me. However, some parts were interesting, nevertheless, the first one was much better. I enjoy books by J.K Rowling, Brian Jacques, Anne McCaffrey and others."
5,Tou Lee's review of Racso and the Rats of Nimh,"The sequel to the outrageously wonderful, Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh, Racso and the Rats of Nimh is just as entertaining and fun to read. A new rat from the city, named Racso, is trying to find these rats of Nimh, but little do they know that Racso has a lot in common with their history."
1,Poor Quality Control,"These boots were defective, the harness was obviously too short and poorly connected on the right boot. I don't know how they made it past QC at the factory. Worse yet, I returned them to Amazon and got the EXACT same defective pair back as a supposed replacement. Needless to say I returned them AGAIN for a full refund. Poor showing, Amazon and Frye."
5,Threw these on for this fist time on Turkey Day...,"And had no problems whatsoever. Felt terrific. Not every boot would be so merciful the fist time on and out the door. Chestnut and burgundy go together splendidly. And the little belt set-up looks dressier than the plain harness. It can also be fiddled with to resemble a regular waist belt. Show your love with some Obenaufs.Fryes have the edge in look and build. Don't hope for a better price, these are American with American cost of living."
2,It was okay...,"This book was just okay. Boring at times, but I got through it. Definitely doesn't even compare to Husseini's Kite Runner and Thousand Splendid Suns. Try reading those, they're among the best books I've ever read."
3,"Really lacking in quantum mechanics, but full of data","This is a classic 60's graduate text.Orthogonal polynomials, Lasers and Hilbert spaces are almost entirely lacking,but data on real world systems abounds.Most of the mathematics is well groundedand the basics are covered as this was a course textfor those in organic Chemistry as well as physical Chemistry.Decay of forbidden and metastable states and Einstein transition probabilitiesis discussed as more statistical mechanical than quantum mechanical in basis.As a graduate text in the 60's it wasn't enougheven with all the observational data included."
4,A Lark,Through the eyes of a young boy we are treated to nature in simplistic terms. All thinking is childlike as well as meandering. No lessons or moral. Just a boy who mindlessly releases three horses. The horses find him and follow him home. A book for the enjoyment of children and adults.
5,Here are the Good Companions,"""How blue the skies, Oh, sweet surprise"" as Marian McPartland sails into the Wilder blue yonder. Sparkling, evanescent luminosities. Brilliant renditions of some of Alec Wilder's best tunes."
4,Still a good belt but not as good as the old days,"This lined belt is still a good one but not as good as before. This used to be a total top quality belt, beautifully made and crafted. It is still OK but there has definately been a quality shift. The stiching is no longer white, aparently batch died after the belt is finished. The leather is not as high quality and it is stamped ""Made in Mexico"" The older ones were not so marked."
5,Keeping cool,I purchased this to set on my kitchen counter to keep me cool while working at the sink. Love it because of its size and effectiveness. It is also light weight and the silver color matches my color scheme.
3,Quiet and effective,"I was looking for this particular brand for quite sometime, and was able to find it on Amazon.com, I placed my order and was able to get within the time period that they suggested that I would receive it. It is very quiet it it is effective for a one person in a small office or cubicle. Not enough to power to cool a room of three people or more, so I had to purchase another to get a grand effect."
3,Good condition,"I bought this keyboard and never got to use it because it wasn't the right one for my laptop, but it was nice to actually get a new keyboard as opposed to a gently used one."
5,Hurricane II Sandal,"Teva makes great sandals. This is my second pair, and I wear them constantly. Thank Heavens for Amazon where I got them for $10 off."
3,Don't watch out of order,"Cute movie. My 4 yo wanted to watch this first so we didn't understand references made that happened in the earlier movies. There were a few pop cultural references he didn't understand either, but that's just the sign of the times. (We don't own a phone, corded nonetheless??) anyway, Amazon shipped fast and the item itself was cheap. Cute and will watch someday again in order!"
5,Go BLT!!!,"Great movie, completely entertaining for kids and parents. Not as good as the first one, but still really cute. Had my 2 year old and my 8 year old spellbound!"
5,satisfied customer,got our movie as said in time frame is a excellent deal for the money and my 3 yr old couldn't be happier
3,Cute but a little farfetched sequel.,"In this ""Brave Little Toaster"" sequel, the talking toaster and his pals build their own spaceship to travel to Mars and save their master's baby son. This is already a little corny. Even the reason for which the master's baby is sent to Mars is strange - an original hearing aid once belonging to Albert Einstein but now living with the master tries to send himself to Mars, but the baby is sent instead by mistake! Then there's the refrigerator who's the Supreme Commander but who really has a strange secret identity. The strangest aspect of the film is the relationship between a space machine on Mars and a Christmas fairy who a little kid left in the machine. However, despite its uniquely strange parts, ""The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars"" is still cute enough to receive three stars by my system."
5,Everything you will ever need to know about mathematics.,It is the most complete book about mathematics I know. I never ever found any mistake in any formula. It is recommendable to every scientist.
3,not a good reference book for mathematician,"It's probably a good book for engineers, but definitely not the right one for mathematician or anybody who needs to do serious math."
3,Great toy but made with stickers that peel easily.,"My two year old loves this plane set, particularly the airplane itself. My only complaint is that all the jet blue branding is on stickers that are already peeling off the plane. Painted on or more durable branding would have been great."
3,Mixed Bag,"I used this set to decorate a cake and then gave it to the birthday boy to play with. This is kind of a mixed bag of quality. The catering truck didn't last a day. The tall signs didn't last much longer. The luggage pieces both came apart and had to be super glued together. The plane is a favorite piece--goes everywhere the birthday boy goes--and is still in great shape. The stickers are starting to peel off the body, but he doesn't seem to mind. The stickers on the other pieces are in various states of well-being.In short, GREAT for the cake, not as great for daily play."
1,Did not recieve.,"I never recieved this item, but was informed that it had been refused. My cost was refunded"
3,A princess remembers,Interesting and honest description of personal life events in the back drop of colonial India. One of the few books that do not speak against the occupying forces. Gives enough peep into private and rather personal palace life in erstwhile princely states. Some portions of the text could have been improved but poor composition doesn't affect reader's interest or book value. Highly recommended if you are interested in colonial era of Indian history. Not a history book but ample authentic information of historical significance is included. Overall it makes good reading. ***
1,Ripped off,I ordered a hard copy of a book for $16.49 and received a damaged small paperback version that I could have purchased from a used bookstore for $1.00. What a rip-off!!
1,thin peice of junk,Don't listen to the high reviews. They must work for this company. This is a piece of plastic covered in thin foam and black fabric. It's actually horrible. Very uncomfortable. You would be better off buying a cheap pillow from WalMart and putting it in a black pillow case. I can't believe they even produced such a stupid product. It does nothing. Your weight will crush it instantly. What a joke and waste of money.
1,Very uncomfortable seat pad,This looked like a decent product for car seat pad for someone with a bad back. The issue is the hard plastic inserts that jab into your thighs. I could not get those to turn outward at all to reduce the new pain.
5,"Expensive, but well worth the cost.","This cushion saved my butt on a long car trip! I have periodic flareups of sciatica and hip pain, aggravated by riding in the car. Even short trips around town usually have me squirming in my seat. With the ObusForme cushion I can ride or drive pain free for hours at a time. I also brought it to a football game, and was comfortable for over three hours on the bleacher seat. It seems like a lot of money to spend on a cushion, and I was really skeptical about ordering it, but I'm so glad I gave it a chance. Well worth the money!!! Amazon had the best price I found, it was $99 at Walgreens."
3,Great design but very little cushioning.,"In terms of shape and form this is a well-designed product, but it is hard to understand why it contains so little foam material. After two weeks it became flat to the point of irrelevance, in such a way that I ended up purchasing a more expensive Wondergel cushion, which features a much simpler design but far better cushioning."
2,Disappointed,I have purchased 3 of these. 2 were great and made my antique kitchen chair and computer seat feel very comfortable. One of the latest I purchased is actually painful from the first few moments on it. I can feel the metal bar pressing into my distal thighs. I am disappointed and sorry that I didn't have the time to exchange it as I had given my other two away to my parents and husband. I would recommend you keep your box and receipt while you try it out just in case you get a lemon. D.
3,Not Thick Enough,"The cushion of seat not thick enough; It does provide adequate alignment/support, but due to its hard edges and base, it hurts the sit bones when one sitting for longer periods of time."
2,Not for big people,"This cushion is not made to be used by men over medium size. It has an interior plastic frame. The sides of the frame swoop upward. The padding is soft, not dense, and the edges of the frame dig into thighs and upper legs. No way I could get used to that."
2,Not as comfortable as I would have liked,"After sitting in my recliner too much and triggering a bout of back pain (that later turned into a severely herniated disc) I purchased the Obus Ultra Forme backrest for added support. I was so happy with the backrest that I decided that adding the seat was called for. It unfortunately turned out to be fairly uncomfortable. The support was pretty good, and the problem might have been that it was too small for my recliner, but I ended up returning it. I'm 6'4"", 200lbs, so maybe I don't have enough built in padding, but regardless, I was disappointed in the seat after being so happy with the backrest."
4,Love it!,"The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that there should be a strap to hold the seat down around my office chair like there is for the back. I have a slippery office chair and this slides around a lot, so I have to put it in the correct spot each time I sit. Otherwise it is a great, comfy seat! I am 5'4 and 130 pounds...if you are a large/wide person this seat may not be wide enough for you. Works great for me!"
3,OK...but not Disney OK,"I got this as Christmas gifts for my niece and nephew. They're decent, but I don't consider them to be high Disney quality. For a child, it's perfect. It won't break. Good product for the money."
3,1yr old boy likes this ok,"my 1yr old boy likes this pretty well, mostly the airplane, firetruck and police car ... he enjoys the rattling noises of the police car and one of the other cars too ... but he likes his bigger Tonka Wheels Pals trucks better."
2,Bad for programmer,"If you are a software programmer who use Borland JBuilder, this suite definitely not for you because you can't launch JBuilder unless you shutdown Zonealarm."
1,Very disappointing experience with this product...,"As on of the other reviewers said, go to their forum and do some research! This is a buggy program that I could not get to install and work properly. It caused immediate blue screens, and had to be removed in safe mode. Apparently this is a common experience. Based on my experiences I can not recommend this program, which is unfortunate given how good their software has been in the past."
1,Verdict: guilty as charged.,"After having seen the glowing review in PC Magazine and the mixed reviews of Amazon customers, I decided to reserve judgment till I'd tested the program myself. Well, the verdict is in. Every time I downloaded ZoneAlarm into a computer, that computer would lose the ability to connect to my on-line service. Guilty as charged."
4,"Good product, bad installer","I purchased this product to upgrade from the 2005 version. The written instructions tell you that the installer will give you the choice of a clean install or upgrade, but it never got that far when I ran it. Instead I got a message that this product could not be used to upgrade. After reading through their (very helpful) online FAQs, I determined that I would first need to uninstall the previous version, then do a clean install. That worked fine, except that every so often when I start up the computer I get a message that my subscription has expired (even though it clearly hasn't.) I emailed support, and they quickly sent a reply with the procedure for correcting the problem... which involves uninstalling, reinstalling, deleting a registry key, blah blah blah. Other than this, I think the product is fine. The only negative thing I can think of with the actual software is that the email protection is very slow, though that may have to do with the size of my inbox."
5,"Effective, Easy & kept my computer's performance","I like it. I'm a big gamer and build performance machines.Another brand was affecting my benchmarks negatively and was even causing intermittent lock-ups on my laptop, which is brand new. After removing the other product and installing the free trial version of ZoneAlarm I was sold and bought the boxed version. I haven't had any trouble whatsoever since. Managing ports for on-line gaming was even easier. Its a simple program that gets the job done. Just take a look at the bloated hard drive requirements on the side of the other brand's box and compare it to ZoneAlarm. There are some free download sites that you can download a trial version from. I recommend trying it for yourself. Don't get me wrong. I used earlier versions of the other product with no trouble. The 2004 version of the other product hurt me. Later versions may be better but the reviews aren't. I intentionally replaced the name of the other product in my review to be fair."
4,Meets my needs...,no product makes up for common sense when playing on the net...but at least this one lets you configure and manage the risks and not just make yes or no decisions. You can still decide wrong and get into trouble but take advantage of the tool suite and do a little research and you should be okay. Installation is clean and software overhead doesn't seam overly intrusive. Good product fair price.
1,Terrible Causes MS Outlook to Crash - Nonresponsive Customer Service,"Terrible Product! I installed it and it made my MS Outlook crash several times a day. Twice I had to reinstall Outlook. Contacted their customer service about the problem. No help, they kept telling me how to reset my Zone Alarm account password. Obviously they don't read their incoming emails and just send out some canned message. After several days of this, I uninstalled Zone Alarm and installed PC-cillin. I had no further problems with Outlook. I previously used Norton and never had my email crash with their product either. My recommendation, don't buy unless you enjoy having Outlook crash and you like to reload software. Interestingly, when I asked for a refund they never answered my emails - go figure."
5,zone alarm security suite field test,"I've used many anti-virus suites and firewalls, but by far this is the easiest I've tried. It is easy to set up and works well."
4,Happy Customer,"After unacceptable experiences with Norton products and Trend Micro's PC-Cillin, Zone Alarm's Internet Security Suite restores my faith in Good Product and Customer Service."
1,Lack of support,"Up until version 6 of Zonealarm, I would have given a hearty two thumbs up for this product. With version 6, and Check Point's take over of zonelabs, they have stumbled hard. Contrary to their assertions, Windows 2000 Pro and XP Pro are NOT fully supported. If you are a running a windows based network with multiple users, active directory, roaming profiles, this product will cause no end of grief for the client machines. New users will not be able to log on. Users will not be able to log onto different computers, unless you uninstall Zonealarm. Zonelabs tech support's response is that they do not support these integral features to Windows. Instead they try to shift you to their 'corporate' Integrity product, which is waaaaaayy too much product for most ZA users and waaaay to expensive."
3,Zone Alarm Security Suite,"I had Zone Alarm Pro all along and decided to get the suite. It was fine until I wanted to upload pictures from my digital camera. My system crashed. I needed support immediately. I found out that Zone Alarm charges nearly $3.00 per minute for telephone support, even for new customers. It took three hours on the phone with Microsoft at a cost of $35.00 total to find out that a file from Zone Alarm ""vsdata95.vxd"" was the problem. This file causes lots of problems. Their product is good, but their tech support is not."
2,Too slow but seems to do the trick,"I purchased Zone Alarm Security Suite 2006 as a replacement for Norton Internet Security 2005. I had been using Norton for several years but decided to change because of what I had been reading about the new Norton 2006 edition. Perhaps this was a big mistake? Zone Alarm loaded easily enough and I was able to set all settings without any problem. However, after loading and starting up, all, and I mean all of my other applications ran extremely slowly from this point on. I have decided to keep Zone alarm in hopes a future update will correct this problem but I doubt that it can or will. I would NOT recommend this software unless ZA fixes this problem in future upgrades. Although it seems to do the job fairly well, it is just too slow and slows down every application I run."
2,"Good in theory, bad in practice","The individual components are very highly rated, but the suite is a resource hog. On a 3.4Ghz overclocked Intel 630 machine with 1GB of RAM there is a considerable slowdown, especially if you have Outlook, Word and Google Desktop running. I was using Norton AV and ZoneAlarm free firewall with Spybot and the difference is noticable. Memory usage for Outlook jumped from 30MB to almost 80MB and it was not unusual to have 100% CPU usage. I decided to unistall this product and use the old combination.I know that there is a known memory leak for Zonealarm Pro, I am dissapointed that they still have not fixed it."
2,No better then Norton Internet Security,"I have purchased this product in hope it will be faster then sluggish NIS, howether this was a mistake. It does not support Thunderbird; it takes minutes to scan mail in Outlook Express after download. Sometimes OE just hangs up so it must be killed and restarted. CPU usage of zlclient.exe and vsmon.exe frequently goes up to 100% and stays there for minutes. Next year I will try AVG."
1,ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite 2006 Fails,"I ordered ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite 2006 after a PC magazine review, I have a 3 month old HP Media Center PC. Th software totaly locked up my machine on install twice. Each ocasion requireing me to reboot in safe mode and to use the restore function to even use my computer. I lost 6 - 8 hours of work befoe I decided to return it. I did receive my refund 8 to 10 weeks after returning the product. I am now using Norton Internet Security with no problems. I transfered it from an older abandoned PC.I mave been a PC user since 82 and am fairly knowledge about hardware and software. This is one of the few programs I could not instal. I have used the free Zone Alarm Firewall without problems.ewb"
3,good virus protection but software update doesn't work on my XP box,works ok as long as i don't update
5,Great luck with Zone Alarm Security Suite,I've used the Zone Alarm Internet Security Suite for the past two years. I've been problem free. It seems to catch and correct any problem that would crop up.
2,Substancial Processing HangUps,"I could not install from the disk, it must have a reading error. So I downloaded ZA Security Suite from their web site and did a CLEAN install with no problems. Then I registered it & downloaded some updates. AND that's when EVERYTHING slowed down or just stopped working. I tried deactivating different features to no avail. I never did find an answer (the wait was too long). So I've uninstalled it and am using Windows firewall and Symantics Anti Virus software."
1,zone alarm suite,Your computer generated questionaire was much appreciated. IT REMINDED ME THAT THIS IS ONE OF (NOW) FOUR ORDERS ONLINE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN RECEIVED. I checked my bank records and it was paid for--please ship!!!!
1,"TRIED TO RETURN, AMAZON SAID NO: ""OPENED MEDIA""","PROBLEMS:(1) within a month of installation, I started getting the message that my subscription for updates had expired.(2) programs running java ran EXTREMELY slowly, taking up massive CPU cycles (IBM Thinkpad T43, 1.5GB RAM, latest Java release from Sun)SOLUTION:uninstalled ZoneAlarm & reinstalled Trend Micro."
3,1 THUMB UP FOR THE PRODUCT AND 2 THUMBS DOWN FOR POOR / NO CUSTOMER SERVICE,I got this ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite 2006 and installed it the instant i got a new computer.I like its internet features and i do feel comfortable that it is doing what it is to do. I can set it to scan for spy ware and virus daily weekly etc and it always finds thing and automatically blocks/de activates them. I really enjoy the email features it also has for spam and email fraud. I do feel protected. THE WORST THING ABOUT THIS SOFTWARE IS THEIR LACK OF CUSTOMER SUPPORT!!! IT IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN!!! THIS PRODUCT WAS NOT CHEAP AND TO PROVIDE LITTLE TO NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS THE WORST!!!!THEY WILL ONLY HELP YOU VIA FAX OR EMAIL! THERE IS NO PHONE TO CALL FOR HELP AND THERE ARE SOME KINKS YOU MUST IRON OUT WHEN USING THE NEW SOFTWARE. (...)
5,Excellent Spanish-Language Pop Songs,"I love female Mexican pop stars like Thal?a and Paulina Rubio, so when I saw the cover of Belinda's CD in Mexico, I was intrigued. But, alas, it was in the children's section of the store, even though the song titles didn't seem like they were addressed towards children. Later, I happened to buy a CD mix that included Belinda's ""Lo siento"" and I knew right away that I had to buy the album.Though only 15, Belinda has a strong, steady voice, which is capable of expressing emotions with a pleasantly sweet rawness, as in ""?D?nde ir? yo?"" All of the songs on this CD are well-written. And all show sophisticated instrumentalization, as exemplified in the low, rumbling start to ""Sin dolor.""If you are looking for well-crafted, yet nicely sweet pop songs, you can't go wrong with Belinda."
4,"Just like HER NAME, She is LINDA and TALENTED!!!","My little cousins all have seen all of her TV Mini Series. She acts really cool. Some poeople say that she is the next SHAKIRA or THALIA. But BELINDA INSISTS saying that she is Unique to her own style and that she admires THALIA and other singers as well.Anyways, THIS CD IS A MUST HAVE. Her name represents all the TALENT SHE HAS. The CD starts with a CATCHY AND AWESOME SONG, Then it goes into Punk and POP. I did not five it a 5 because I REALLY DON""T LIKE PUNK and so I SKIPPED like 2 songs only. THE REST ARE REALLY FRESCHING, RELAXING, CATCHY, and GOOD LYRICS for a girl her age. You won't regret buying THIS CD."
1,Pobrecita....,"Pobrecita la verdad este cd tiene ALGUNAS casiones que estan mas o menos, pero ponganla a cantar en vivo y entonces si arruina las canciones....pero bueno cada quien con sus gustos. La verdad yo no recomiendo este cd. ademas q esta rated como Rock y eso no es nada de rock...."
5,Great CD!!!,I love this CD. It's the best CD she's ever done. I love the song VIVIR from Corazones Al Limite. I had to order it online though because I couldn't find it at any stores. I'm a big fan of hers and for those people who don't like her they suck.
4,Bewitching,"There are times when you listen to an album for the first time and it feels perfect for the moment. Think of Coldplay's Parachutes or Feeder's Echo Park. The Picture show contains utterly beautiful, bitter-sweet, spirit lifting tunes, the sort of music that you hear snatches of during scenes of high emotion in Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Roswell. Kieran Scragg's haunting voice delivers lyrics which are deep, moody and moving over swirling keyboards and strings.Yet there are accelerator tracks of urgent guitars and driving drum rythms. A wonderfull uplifting and spiritual work of pop rock."
3,yep...not bad,"there's a little song that keeps popping up on my ipod lately, the song is called ""Barricade"" and it's been played several times in random mode on my train ride to work, that i had to pull my ipod out of my bag and see who is singing this song. well, it turned out to be the Buffseeds. i had had this cd and their ""sparkle me"" ep for a few months but never gave them the proper listening attention they needed. so i sat down and listened again. my conclusion...these are good songs and the Buffseeds are a good band with promise. alot of pretty good songs with a few great ones. but overall, i tend to get just a little bit bored. a nice little record, nonetheless."
3,A Minute With You,"This band from Devon, England has an interesting pop sound, even if the sounds seem to have largely the same loud jangly guitars and peppy midtempo percussion which tends to make the songs run together. ""Who Stole the Weekend"" seems to pop along with a strong melody, ""A minute with you is better than a year with myself."" ""Ocean Blue"" thunders pleasantly with Kieran Scragg's vocals always containing a bit of heartache. ""The Picture Show"" is a good effort that with a bit more variety in the songwriting and arrangements might be quite memorable. Enjoy!"
4,Great Documentary,"I grew up in Southern Indiana, and my grandparents were in this tornado, near Griffin, Indiana which was wiped out. So I grew up hearing the stories and watching their faces everytime the sky took on that greenish tint. I really appreciated the interviews with the folks that were there. Many of them are getting up in years, so its important to record their stories about what happened. This documentary also does a nice job of following the track of the is monster tornado, which was on the ground for a long time in Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana, and supposes that instead of one big tornado, it was more likely a series of multiple vortex tornadoes dropped from one big storm system. I would have given the content five stars, but it gets four because the quality of the burn was a little iffy. The DVD played fine on the computer, but had a couple of sticky spots on my portable DVD player. Highly recommended!"
5,I now know every song...,My daughter loves the Cheetah girls. I thought that by uing this CD I would be tormeted for hours by four girls singing. I was wrong sometimes I listen to it when my daughter is not in the car with me. Very cute album
5,AWESOME!!!!!,"I LOVE the songs from the cheetah girls so much!! They are prefect for kids my age!! I'm ten. I think the cheetah girls should be for girls from at least 6 years old to 14 years old. Believe me, if you like cheetah girls, then you'll LOVE this soundtrack so much!! My favorite songs are The party's just begun, Step Up, Dance with me, and Why wait. It's AWESOME!!!!!"
4,Great for your little Cheetah Girl,"After listening to the first Cheetah Girls soundtrack, I couldn't wait to purchase this one for my 9 year old daughter. The Cheetah Girl's songs have such a positive message for girls of all ages. The only thing better is hearing them in concert. All I have to say is WOW! These girls (minus Raven since she doesn't perform with them on stage) can really sing. They sound great live, so you know their voices aren't played with on their cds. My daughter and I listen to both Cheetah girls cd's in our van and it takes us right back to the concert."
4,Too Old To Listen,"Okay, I may be too old to listen to the Cheetah Girls, but their second soundtrack is great. There music is made for older audiences and some of it you can relate to. If you don't listen to anything please listen to ""It's Gonna Be Alright"" by Raven-Symone she co-wrote this song and is amazing."
5,Latin with a Cheetahlicious Twist!,"The Cheetah Girls just seem to be getting better and better.Their voices sound much stronger, and they each compliment each other in every song.I love how they incorporated Latin beats in both the movie and soundtrack. I enjoy every song on this track, the lyrics are positive, and it sends out great messages of friendship.I feel they should have included Raven in the Barcelona Mix of ""Cheetah Sisters"". Adding Belinda to the songs was also a nice twist to the Cheetah Songs.Once you buy this for your kids (or yourself!) You won't wanna stop listening. Great buy."
1,my eardrums are broken.........,"ok, yeah.....this was so interesting. WHAT WAS WITH THAT STUPID ANGEL GUY???!!!! i mean, what does Raven(or ""galleria"") even see in that weirdo-stalker???? my ear drums are permanentally damaged thanks to his high pitched whailing sound at the end of that song Strut. i mean it was all ""WAAAHHHHHAAHHAHAHAH""!!! thats all."
4,One of the Best!,"Bernard DeVoto ranks among the most prominent historians of the last century. His writing reflects an early, somewhat oratorical style that was common in the middle 1900s. Don't be put off by a writing style that verges on the florid. This is a beatifully written account of one year (1846) in America's history. DeVoto describes aspects of American culture, economics, politics and philosophy in a manner that makes each topic a fascinating one. He's not afraid to prick with a writer's pin the nitwits and boobs of our history and he can be absolutely hilarious when he does. In his conclusion he draws together all these disparate elements to demonstrate that 1846 truly was a ""year of decision"" in our nation and that it contained ingredients fundamental to our character and development.If you read only one history of the United States in the 19th century, this should be your choice."
1,Dated and boring,"Written in 1942 in a style that is at best outdated, this book is a collection of dis-jointed stories that have no real theme. If you are a reader of recently written history books you will be severly disappointed by this recitation of meaningless characters, distractions and lack of action. How DeVoto has managed to take one of the most interesting times in U.S. history and make it so unengaging is staggering.The publishers of this book have taken an out of date work, slapped a mimimal introduction from Stephen Ambrose in front of it and are hoping to catch the coat tails of Ambrose and the interest of readers of American history. If this one is a success they will probably bring out the rest of the DeVoto trilogy. Great marketing idea, boring book.I fell for it. Don't waste your money.PS. I just read a great book, ""Six Frigates"" by Ian Toll."
2,Pretty opinionated historian,"If you ask me, Mr. DeVoto is kinda full of himself. Maybe that's how history was written in his day. I'm looking for something more objective. I will admit, by the way he writes he can tell an interesting story. I'd just rather not hear so many judgments pronounced."
4,The Year of Decision 1846,A great read. Reading this book provided insight into an era of our history that I was not familiar with while filling in gaps and bringing historical characters to life.
3,I would rather have a corded version,"When I first got this item a couple of years ago, it was great. I have noticed, however, that the battery life on it is not very long (just a few minutes) and then it takes hours to recharge. Also, it seems that if you just leave it plugged in all the time (as I do, in case I have an accidental spill, I want it to be charged) then the battery life shortens dramatically. The suction is OK and it does a pretty good job on the messes like hairballs and even red wine (provided you start cleaning it up before it gets a chance to soak into the carpet), but like I said, the fact that it's battery operated instead of just plugged in makes it kind of a hassle."
2,just ok,"its from the late 70s or early 80ds video , not worth the money , very little on ship wrecks..nice photo on the tin box.."
1,Ship wrecks,"The product was received in damaged packaging, the metal container was dented and the plastic wrap was torn. The DVD's were interesting."
1,Short on length,"Did not come as listed, it was many inches to short which was kind of a surprise as very few people would be able to use them at that length.We had to returned them.We hope they would have been fine had they been the correct length."
3,Shower stall curtain liner in white vinyl,I was looking for a vinyl shower stall curtain liner in white and couldn't find one in stores so ordered it here. The curtain is advertised as heavy duty and I find it to be pretty lightweight. But you can't beat the price. I'm satisfied.
3,What happened?,"I remember loving the IMAX release of Titanica, and I finally picked up the DVD. Now, I didn't expect the visuals to match those of the big screen (that's why IMAX is what it is), but I was appalled by the ""blue-light special"" editing job. While the original theatrical release was some 90 minutes long, this DVD was only an hour long, yet it somehow boasted ""additional footage""! The result is a version of Titanica-lite that skips a LOT of footage, both underwater as well as biological and scientific insights courtesy of the Russian crew. This is very, very disappointing, seeing as this now feels like half a documentary."
1,Save your money,"This IMAX DVD is very disappointing. Much of it consists of old newsreel footage and still images of the Titanic rather than the stunning IMAX photography I was expecting. There is even quite a bit of time devoted to images of the submersible crews looking out their window and operating the subs. If you are looking for a short, semi-documentary on the Titanic, this might appeal to you, but if you are looking for IMAX images of the ship then this DVD is a total flop."
2,not that good,"I have seen many Imax films, and this has to be one of the worst. There is not much footage of the ship, only a long winded story of her history.Also where are the extras!!!!. This film is best seen on a Imax screen and nowhere else."
4,How Much Is Your Safety Worth?,"They don't fit the tightest around the legs, they aren't the prettiest color, but what they do, & well, is give you a stopping layer of protection from a chain moving @ more than 10,000 rpm. I hope they are never put to the test!BTW, these safety chaps do not look anything like the above picture of a two-line phone splitter!"
2,Too Big!!!,"I am 6 feet tall and weigh about 180lbs. Unless you have legs like tree trunks these are simply too big, especially around the legs. The cinch straps wont tighten enough on these meaning they are free to rotate around and leave your legs dangerously exposed. For just a little bit more money you can buy properly fitting Stihl chaps from the store. I wouldn't recommend these to anybody apart from Nellie the Elephant or Dumbo."
2,Poor fit for average sized guy,"At 5'11 and 200lbs, I guess I am fairly average sized. These chaps are enormous for 'one size fits all'. They should advertise that they protect your stomach and chest since you have to cinch the belt up near your nipples to keep from tripping over the bottoms. One remark I heard was that I appeared to be a 90 year old man with my Sansabelt slacks pulled up sky high. I wore boots & jeans and they were still very baggy.I didnt test the function of the chaps, but they seemed to be fairly easy to work in. They were hot though...I had to take them off every half hour to cool off.All in all, if they do what they are supposed to, I'll be happy to put up with the poor fit and odd looks to keep my legs attached to the rest of my body."
1,Gap in protection,"Because of the way these chaps are cut and the one-size-fits-all fitting (my waist is 34""), the leggings tend to rotate so that my inner calfs and thighs are very exposed. It seems that the inner legs are as likely to get hit as the outer legs, so I think this is a pretty major design flaw. I plan on returning mine and trying something else."
2,Not really one size fits all,"The quality of these chaps seems pretty good, but the claim of one size fits all is misrepresentation.Unless you are 6 foot plus, 200lbs and have a hefty build, especially thighs and legs, these will not fit you.I'm 5 feet 9, 168 lbs. and they were a good 6 inches too long and with the straps tightened all the way were still very loose on my legs."
1,Not a Pleasant Taste,"I enjoy chocolate covered marshmallow candy - but I had to spit out bites from the two of these that I tried. The marshmallow appears to be yellowing. Although the expiration date is 2014, the candy tastes very stale."
3,Cute,"Works as advertised but has only 12 seconds to tape a brief message, which means all it can do is ""twitter."""
5,No coffeetable should be without it....,For anyone who loves the shadowy world of film noir this collection of full page photo's is a great gift.
1,Pathetic,"I'm a fan of Greg Plitt, but you won't learn anything here that you didn't learn in junior high gym class.How ridiculous to have a fitness genius like Plitt available and not allow him to really teach and train his incredible philosphy on working out."
1,20 minutes!,"This was a waste of money. Only 20 minutes and was overpriced. Greg Plitt does not help, its only for him to show off. If one is looking for a DVD workout their are better."
5,Great workout for me..,THE ALL DUMBBELL DVD was great If you are training at home and using dumbbell this will work fine all you need is time and your hard work.
3,susan,"I thought the product was fine - it was what my daughter wanted for the nursery. However, the registered third-party seller named Smart Deals, Inc. really ripped me off on the shipping charges. I ordered this item along with 2 other small, light weight items and standard shipping was nearly $22.00. They were poorly packed in one box and should have cost no more than $10.00 to ship. I would never buy from these people again!"
1,Bad Decision,"I bought this mobile thinking it would bo so cute and I was wrong. The canopy top piece of the mobile was fine, but the boats hanging from it looked terrible. The boats looked like oval balls and the stiching also looked of poor quality."
2,Looks Nice,The mobile looks nice in my baby's room but it doesn't spin like it should. It seems like the mobile part is too wide and gets in the way of the base and isn't able to spin.
4,good so far,"This was easy to put together, I did it myself in about 3 minutes and it was easy to attach to the crib. We are expecting our daughter in 4 days so we will see if she likes it."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!,OK SO IT DOES NOT FIT ON MY CRIB. AS A MATTER OF FACT I DONT THINK IT WOULD FIT ON ANY WOOD CRIB. WOULD PROBABLY ONLY FIT ON ONE OF THOSE CHEAP METAL CRIBS. TRID TO RETURN ITEM BUT PAID ALMOST AS MUCH FOR THE ORIGINAL SHIPPING AS I DID THE MOBILE AND THEN WAS TOLD I WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO SHIP IT BACK SO I KEPT IT OUT OF SPITE. BY THE TIME THEY REFUNDED ME THE 14.99 FOR THE MOBILE I WOULD HAVE PAID 30 DOLLARS IN SHIPPING. NOT HAPPY!!!!
3,poor quality item/even worse shipping,"When I first saw this adorable looking (online) crib mobile I was excited. The look was great and the price better. Unfortunately, it arrived in a crushed box and the plastic pieces were just stuffed into the box with out a plastic container. It looked as if someone found it in a warehouse on the floor and shoved it into a box. Just a suggestion to the seller. The product must arrive looking as appealing as it does online. I'm returning it ASAP. Warning...you get what you pay for!Debbie in New Mexico."
2,doesnt fit the crib,This might be a great product except for the small fact that I can't use it at all because it will not attach to the crib.
1,DON'T BUY!,"I read the reviews of others having problems with the seller and figured it's a small problem. Apparently it's not. We received the mobile with 2 missing parts and 1 WRONG part (the image in the diagram is different).Tried to return, and not only do you pay for the return shipping, but they also charge a 20% restocking fee. The math looks like this - $39.99 + $14(s/h)=$54 + $10 (return s/h)- $32 (refund) = $32. So to return this item still costs you $32!To top it all off, the quality of the mobile is questionable.Do yourself a favor, stay away from JoJo products and stay away from Beyond Bedding. Amazon should investigate the seller seeing as how this issue appears to be widespread."
3,Expensive,This mobile was extremely expensive.....my baby girl's crib set of 12 pieces only cost me 150 from another site but this one piece from this site cost me 41. I only bought it since this was my first child and I wanted her to have a matching set.
1,HORRIBLE CHEAP DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,This is the worst item I have ever purchased on Amazon the music box wasnt powerful enough to turn the mobile! I called to ask for a new one or exchange but they wanted me to pay the shipping back for what I call a defective item. The arm of the mobile is barely long/deep enough for it to spin when I switched out the music box for one that I have had for over 10 years and had been passed down through 4 other kids. The only good thing is that is matched the bedding and that is it!! DO NOT BUY THIS!! I didnt even want to give it one star as it didnt even deserve that!!
3,Could have a better attachment device,"The mobile is nice, but the design could be a little different. We have a brand new crib & in order to keep it from getting all scratched from the tightening device I had to put something in between the crib & the base that attaches to the crib. Not a crisis, but for the price of the mobile I would have expected a better device for attaching to the crib."
3,"Not the best, But looks great!!!","Looks fabulous in the room, but as far as mobiles go, its weak...For my purposes it's fine, I just set up a nursery for my grandson who visits occasionally. This is not the perfect mobile for everyday use."
5,Beautiful Book!,Highly professional effort printed on high resolution clay faced photographic paper using real photo offset for the reproductions. Many full page prints in this beautiful folio containing 84 illustrations! 6 stars out of five; especially considering the low price.
2,zzzzzz,Too slow moving for my taste. And when the horror comes it's really cheesy. Should be called vampire boredom. Zzzzzzz.
1,Guaranteed eyestrain,"This isn't so much a review of the movie as much as the Eclectic DVD transfer of Vampire's Night Orgy (aka Orgy of the Vampires). I like the movie. It's a cool, very atmospheric 70's Spanish origin vampire flick featuring Helga Line, a personal fave.The problem is the image quality of this Sinema Diable/ Eclectic DVD. It's letterboxed as advertised on the cover, but it's so dark it's actually unwatchable. It seems to become darker as the film progresses as well. The color is also so washed out it's bordering on black and white. A very disappointing experience."
1,Saw it on youtube. Pass it.,"Saw the full thing on youtube movies, It's horrible, really bad, I wish I can give it a less than zero Rating. Horrible Cheesy Dubbed In English, Spanish Film. Least scariest vampires ever. Not worthy of buying or renting. Thank God I saw it for free."
1,The Vampire's Night Orgy-Movie?,"Saw the full thing on youtube movies, It's horrible, really bad, I wish I can give it a less than zero Rating. Horrible Cheesy Dubbed In English, Spanish Film. Least scariest vampires ever. Not worthy of buying or renting. Thank God I saw it for free."
2,Faulty CD,I love the Wright Bros. The only problem is with the CD. The beginning of the first song had a glitch so a few words of the first song were skipped.
3,A collection of beautiful images,"It is no more than this. It has some fair techniques on how to achieve several effects, but someone cannot expect to learn how to make digital sci-fi art.Also, it seems a little outdated now, even though the copyright says 2004.My opinion is do not waste money on some collection of outdated artwork and look for something else."
3,Far from Step-by-Step,"Step-by-Step is somewhat of a misnomer. It's more like a summary of techniques with a general guideline for how it's done in various commonly used graphics software packages. Once you get into the details, there's a lot missing unless you already know how to use the software. But the pictures are exquisite and worth the money just for inspiration alone."
2,Not a good tape.,"FALSE ALARMS, THREE PESTS IN A MESS, FLAT FOOT STOOGES. The only good one is FALSE ALARMSFALSE ALARMS (1936) is in my top ten Curly films because of all the great gags. There's a great big car chase at the end. Car chases are always fun to watch.THREE PESTS IN A MESS (1945)- A bad short, well, maybe not all of it. The first half of the film is great, with funny gags including Christine McIntrye beating up Curly. The Stooges try to run, but accidentally shoot a window dummy. That's where the short gets bad. They take the ""body"" to a pet graveyard and the owners show up in scary costumes. This part is inapropriate for general audiences. The second half of the film is not related to the plot of the first half. This also happened in BOOBY DUPES, the following short.FLAT FOOT STOOGES (1938) is not great, but not terrible either. There's just nothing special about it. Too weird of a plot.Not a good tape, one great short, two weak ones."
3,"Solid, not spectacular.","I have to agree more with the Editorial review than with all the glowing customer reviews. After listening to four LaFave albums on the recommendation of a friend, I have to say that I am missing the attraction. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of Texas music--I count Townes Van Zandt, Robert Earl Keen, Lyle Lovett, Steve Earle and James McMurtry among my very favorite songwriters. But, while I do think LaFave has a cool voice, his songwriting lacks the spark and intelligence of the above-mentioned songwriters. The songs are not bad, but they are merely serviceable. I have yet to hear a LaFave song that makes me think, wow, I've got to hear that one again. If your musical diet consists of a lot of radio country, then yeah, LaFave is a breath of fresh air. But if you've been weaned on true quality Texas songwriting, then LaFave's efforts will leave you feeling unsatisfied."
3,Small adjustments needed.,"(Using amazon reader on my computer and Droid X)Purchased the text book awhile ago and been using it as a review guide for class. Noticed a few problems. First the page numbers are way off. Scrolling from page to page is difficult because it jumps from page 1 to 7, 23, etc, making it difficult to scroll back to pages you've read on the location bar. Second the diagrams are difficult to read. Would be nice if they formatted the diagrams to fit the pages some of the scanned images are good but others become blurry when I zoom in.The upside is that it has been much more convenient having it on my ereader than carrying a huge text book along with everything else in my bag. Once problems are fixed I'll give it 5 stars.A Concise Review of Clinical Laboratory Science"
3,a long way to go,"i bought this book on the premise that the book was for students and working techs alike. keep it around the lab...The written information is clear and to the point.On the other hand, the image bank is lacking, especially in parasitology just a couple drawing(not very good ones at that)not diagrams just 5year old drawings. Other pics that hit me as vague(at best) was the 1 of basophilic stippling of RBCs. if i was on a bench looking at it, i would never be able to pick it up with this book's online picture. i.e. i have seen Baso stippling.the good is that book is great for basic basics, but if u want anything specific on the individual disciplining(micro.b, haemo, parasite, histo.cyto) look for books focusing on the individual grouping"
5,Good book.,Good book. I studied with this book among other books and passed both the MT and the MLT(ASCP) exams. The information is not too in depth but can give the reader a good general (concise?) review of Clinical Laboratory Science.
5,This is a wonderful book for college student,This book is excellent for people that are in College and majoring in Hemotology or any kind of Medical Technology. I am in my fifth year of college and when I needed to get certified I used this book and it was remarkable. I couldn't believe how much I learned and how easy it was compared to other books I have read. If you need to get certified in this field this book is great.
3,Written like a condensed textbook.,"I bought this study guide because the one that the Navy provided me to use for the ASCP certification was the BOC which is straight questions and answers with some explanations to follow if you're lucky. Although this textbook is condensed and has key words in bold which helps them to stick in your mind, I feel as though it's leaving a lot out.I've taken quite a few practice exams and this material was missing quite a few topics, however I like the format in which it's presented. I accessed the online ""pictures"" hoping for more, but it's only the pictures that are already in the book, but in color. Also, I wish there were practice questions in the text at the end of each section so that you can do somewhat of a review, but there isn't.Honestly, if you're trying to get MLT / MT ASCP certified, I highly recommend Lab CE online. You need to pay for it, but it has excellent questions, answers, and explanations."
3,hard to set up,It is nice but it is hard for my kids to set up alone. I was hopping it would be easy to set up.
1,Don't buy it!,"My 5 year-old son received this as a gift for his birthday. I feel bad that my SIL spent this much money on it. It took quite a while to put together. The quality is quite poor! Every time he tries to play with it, it falls apart. I have to fix it for him each time he uses the ramp. Extremely disappointing! I was also surprised that it didn't come with a single airplane or car."
1,"Terrible, stupid toy!","We asked Grandma for a toy with which my son could play his matchbox cars, something with a ramp. She thought she was doing us a favor by buying something you fold up and use to store the cars, along with a ramp and ""lift"". As the other reviews say, you can't use it for storage until you take off ALL the pieces you spent a lot of cursing getting putting together. The lift was broken by Christmas afternoon and the ramp doesn't stay on :-("
2,Junky,Have to agree with the rest of the reviewers. My son was excited to receive this as a gift but the quality is poor and the ramp doesn't stay together at all. There's no way to easily get it back into the case without taking it completely apart - which would be difficult for a 5 or 6 year old. Very disappointed.
2,Falls apart not mobile.,"This looked great. A carrying case and everything. But zillion small parts take an adult about 30 minutes to assemble, and don't snap securely-- thus it falls apart almost right away with regular play. Plus you have to unassemble everything to use the carrying case. So there's no point to the carrying case. We spent christmas with relatives and left it behind because it was such a headache. How could santa give us such an expensive piece of junk?"
5,great gift,"I bought this for a new college grad to put in his new office, and he loves it! The shrimp and plants are doing great, and it gives him a nice little break from working on the computer all day. Everyone who sees it is also very intrigued, so I'd say it is an all around great gift."
1,A fool and their money,"If you have nothing else better to do but waste your money with this dust collector, then go for it. The shrimp do NOT last for years. I think it's sick and unrealistic to think anything can live in this sealed up container -"
1,DONT BUY,I bought it. It was a ripoff. It is about $3 worth of supplies. These shrimp are bred prolifically so it is a tremendous profit. It is animal cruelty. They barely grow and struggle to survive with the lack of food.
3,Kind of Sucks,"This book is written in captions like ""When bad diseases happen to good girls"" It's stupid. Any the information I wanted was almost non-existant. I'm sure there are much better books out there, which is probably why this is out of print."
5,Singin' it on & on & on....,"My daughter is 5 years old. She's no stranger to learning about differences between people's appearances, but this book was different in a positive, important way. Half-way through our first reading, she said for the first time ever ""hey mama it just doens't matter what who [anyone] looks like!"" She also picked up the repetitive, sing-songy-ness of this book after only a couple pages, retelling me the story as we went. She has requested for me to read this book more than any other & she continues telling it happily to herself while she plays. I believe this is an excellent addition to any home or early childhood education library, but especially for the musically inclined kids."
5,Fun and Teaches a Valuable Lesson,"This book has a rhythm that is fun and unique. It also teaches children how everyone looks different from the color of our skin, our noses, our hair, and more yet we can enjoy being together, being friends, and being family. What a wonderful book."
2,Beginners beware,"I bought Inspired 3D Character Setup hoping to find a smarter workflow for my own character rigs. As a veteran animator, I am always looking for new and more efficient techniques.I found this book full of great tips and knowledge on character setup, but unfortunately it was also full of errors and missing steps. I managed to find my way around the mistakes and eventually get the desired setup (I think), but it wasn't an easy task. I was pulling my hair out on more than one occasion and I've been doing this for seven years.Overall, I would not recommend this book to a beginner if you plan to learn from the tutorials. The authors should have taken more time to proofread and test their workflows or at least included a supplementary guide on the website that corrects the obvious errors."
3,semper gumbi (always flexable),"I have been using Maya extensively now for two years and bought this book to try to take myself into the intermediate level of character rigging.The first problem I encountered with this book is that I opened it and the spine broke! Not exactly what you would expect from a [$$$] book.I think it went downhill from there. Yes the pictures are beautiful and the it really showcases what you can do with Maya(or what others have done), but the editing in this book is terrible. Examples include naming of nodes that on the same page have two different names. The downloads don't match the book. e.g. ch13 has the low-res geo download that doesnt include the sphereCTRL or the cubeCTRL but sure has the proxyGEO. Anyone think i'm messed up? send me the right one please..Otherwise, you are better off with the Art of Maya, or Secrets of the Pros. I think this is one not quite worth the money."
3,This book should have stated that it is MAYA specific,"Hard for me to rate this book, while the presentation is very good with real world application and opinions on the CG industry, the material jumps around too often with no apparent cohesive to follow for one example to another. It does present very good information on rigging characters, but as I mentioned it really needed organization of the material in a clear and structure manner instead of being all over the place. I MUST mention that this book will go very nicely if you are a MAYA user, but will be problematic for non-MAYA users as all the examples require Maya to follow along, and are of course very MAYA specific."
3,Not bad book but the bonus material doesn't exist,"the book offers a great initiation for the beginers users. The text explains the concepts of ik, fk, pole vectors etc are great and have detailed and useful information. But the great problem of this book is when you start the advanced lessons.The web site where you can find the bonus material is under construction. I've buyed the book by second hand and it's an old edition.I'm sure than years ago was avalible,but actually the book is incomplete."
1,service/scam,"SCAM, SCAM, SCAM, THIEFS....I ordered ""The Fighting Grasshoppers: US Liaison Aircraft Operations in Erope"". Paid for quicker service as I teach Aerospace Technologies at the high school level in Florida. This book was an important piece needed.I NEVER RECEIVED IT... however, the delivery party said it was delivered to my address (which is a mail box), but the personnel at the UPS store said that it was never delivered. So what could have happened... SOMEONE SCAMMED ME AND STOLED MY BOOK.They told me there were no other books available, this was a lie. I checked online and saw that their was, however, the price has increased. I went throught the motion to ordered and it did confirm my suspension that the book was still available. But I would have to pay more. WHAT A SCAM...Myself and my students were looking forward to reveiwing this book as we were building a replica of this airplane, but now we cannot. DO NOT DO BUINESS WITH AMAZON.COM. THEY WILL LIE TO YOU TO GET MORE MONEY..."
3,Others are better,"I absolutely love Tom Kenyon and I think his stuff is amazing. That said, I would recommend that you get The Gandharva Experience if you really want to tap into the power that he offers. This one isn't my favorite."
5,An enlightening look at Shakespeare's plays.,Frye expertly reviews and comments on over half-a-dozen of the Bard's best works. The only problem with the book is that he doesn't look at more of Shakespeare's works!
2,Pulp-fiction readers only,"Monkey Station is a rather shallow, apocalyptic story withthe slightly novel twist of the survivors being hidden in the Amazon. Unfortunately the rest of the book lacks imaginative writing. Killer plagues? Yawn. Lonely band of survivors ekeing out a back-to-basics existence? Yawn again. Super-intelligent monkeys? zzzzz...."
5,Beneath These Waters,Book was in new condition. I was very pleased to find this book and I didn't expect it to be in new condition for the price I paid.
3,Subs sound good,I ordered four of these subwoofers and had the first three in my hands in just a few days. The fourth came a few days later. The woofers preformed as expected and sounded pretty good for the money. My only complaint is that the fourth woofer was a few noticeable shades different in color then the first three I received. I suspect they were made at different times and the quality control was not in place to prevent this.
2,Cheap,I only bought these because they were cheap and I needed them at the time. They don't last too long. You should probably try a different brand.
2,Why Did I Buy These Again?,"Not much of a shelf live here, you're much better off making the conversion to rechargeable batteries that will save u money over the long-run & are much more eco-friendly."
5,normal run of the mill AA,"Not much to say here, your normal run of the mill AA batteries. They were of good quality and did not die in 2 hours like some low end AA's Would purchase them again."
4,Standard batteries,"I mean, what more do could you want from batteries? These get the job done, so they performed exactly how I wanted them to."
3,Basic Battery !!,"I agree with other reviews here, these are basic, good for a remote, but not something like a defibelator, kidding there.. Basic batteries at a basic price, at least they did not leak like the cheap ones I bought from Radio Shack,(their brand)"
1,The worst,Panasonic batteries are low quality dreck that explode and destroy the devices in which they are used. Buy them if you hate your consumer electronics and want an excuse to get new ones.
1,Poor capacity,"Extremely poor capacity, my mouse last for 2 weeks with those! Dont buy, and buy another brandnot worth the price"
1,Batteries Exhausted!,"Opened package and placed them in my digital camera to take pictures on Christmas Day. Message came up that said ""BATTERIES EXHAUSTED"". Brand new batteries that had no charge! Got ripped off on a product that did not work! Buyer Beware"
2,Blech.,"Only bought this for a college class... I'm sorry, but it's boring. I suppose the book is good for its purpose, but... just... blech."
2,"Poor Instructional Material... If You Are An Instructor, DO NOT UseThis Book In Your Classes","This book is next to useless in helping students to understand fallacies and identify them. It is probably the poorest instructional material I have encountered in all of my years in college. Humor was incorporated into this text in an effort to help students better understand the material, however, that effort is a big failure when it comes to this student, and probably also for many others.Instead of helping, the humor detracts from the instructional value of the material and distracts the student rather than helping him or her to comprehend. Chapters 4, 5 and 6 deal with rhetoric and fallacies, however, I have found those three chapters to be the most incomprehensible and unhelpful chapters in the entire book. I am glad I got a used copy of this book... it is certainly NOT worth the price tag placed on a new copy."
1,Faulty Product/Hassle to Have Warranty Honored,"Farm Innovators Ice Chaser Cast Aluminum Floating Plastic Tank De-Icer Model H-418, 1,250-WattThe unit did not last but a few days beyond the 30 days that would permit a return to the seller. The manufacturer suggested unsafe methods of use to remedy the problem. They wanted me to bypass the ground fault breaker by using an extension cord to a non GFI outlet and stopped returning emails when I asked how to make a warranty claim. The warranty is for three years, but means little as I search for a replacement unit. I would have been better off paying more at a local retailer who would make the return beyond the thirty days on a product that did not work. As result, I have lost confidence in the seller, ANTonline, Farm Innovators and Amazon.com."
3,Broke after one season,"The product works fine until it breaks. That said, mine tripped the GFI (ground fault interrupter safety outlet that MUST be used to prevent electrocution) after the first season. I dried it out and tried another GFI on a different circuit and the same thing happened. One of the Amazon reviews tells of another user's interaction with the manufacturer in an attempt to receive warranty satisfaction. Having read that review I decided to buy a different product to replace this one. If the product fails in the dead of winter the pond will freeze over then it's very difficult to insert a replacement heater."
5,Best way to find the one you have is to buy a new one.,"We bought one of these last winter to keep the horses water thawed and then forgot about it. After chipping ice for a month we ordered a new one and when it arrived we found the old one. Oh well, now we have a backup. We have a 250 gallon plastic tank and it works quite well, keeping the surface liquid until the temps drop below 10 degrees and then the edges begin to freeze. At minus 10 it still leaves a 18"" circle open. Plenty for the horses to get at. We also have Farm Innovators de-icer for our chickens and rabbit. I wasn't certain about the rabbit one being only 25 watts but it has kept the water thawed down to zero."
2,Not bad,"Not a bad product, the only problem I am having is that the automatic updates do not work. Have to manually download updates from the website.I suppose I am getting better protection if i am using a Pro version, but not really sure.Spyware never seems to update when i click on the ""update spyware"" link, alwasy reads ""not responding"".If I could go back in time, I would have stayed with the free version.I wouldn't recommend it nor would I buy it again."
3,Mixed feelings about this product,"I bought this product because I had downloaded a demo version from their site that worked pretty well. I had to reformat and reinstall my programs, and when I tried the product again, it slowed the internet connection to the point of it being useless. I have since removed the software, and I am a bit reluctant to install it again on the system, even though I have the licensed version, afraid that it will mess things up to the point of having to reformat and reinstall, which would be a small catastrophe in my case. The first time worked like a charm, the second time it was awful. I don't know what to do with it now. I am waiting for a ""computer wiz"" friend to help me decide if it is a good idea to install it or not."
3,Bought to upgrade to new version for 20% of cost,"Bought this old version to upgrade to 2007 version, worked fine and only cost 20% of current version. Software works ok...buy and update the sw-->then dload the update which is really 2007-->good to go"
1,Use someone else',"The Windows XP kept crashing my system. The customer support engineer was helpful but provided list of insturctions that anyone would lose patience to try lenghty workaround.Try Kerio, Norton or someone else's"
4,Great step up from blocks,"This toy is a great step up from Duplo/lego style blocks. This seems really great for challenging my pre-schooler with fine motor skills.After I ordered I was surprised to see a note that this includes parts that are a choking hazard. If you get only the rings (star) shaped pieces, I can't see a choking hazard - they are about 2 1/2 in diameter and 1/2"" thick and far to large to swallow.They are however, a little hard to stick together so this is not a good toy for a younger (under 2) toddler. But ages 2-3 would be fine.These are well made and very versatile. Makes a great alternative to quiet time play when legos/duplo style blocks are getting boring. Only complaint is that the the lid to the box does not fit well and never seems to stay on."
5,Interstar Rings - Great Fun - Inspire Creativity,"Interstar Rings were purchased for my grandchild. The item was fairly priced, arrived promptly and was packed well. When the gift was opened, my grandchild eagerly began building the structures only the imagination of a child can visualize. Each structure was a complete success! Interstar Rings appear to be very durable and well worth the investment!"
5,Love this for kids!,"This nativity is awesome for kids! My daughter can actually play with it, instead of me constantly telling her not to touch the silver one I have. A great teaching tool to get my 3 year old to learn the true meaning of Christmas!"
5,Christmas for Sam,"Our grandson loves this playset! If we rearrange the little people, he can put them right back where they belong - and that was after our explaining it to him only once! We have a lot of fun sharing the Christmas story with him and he loves the musical angel on top the best. He'll carry baby ""Ez-us"" around with him for hours and loves to ""dance"" to Away in a Manger. This arrived early, in perfect condition, and is study enough to withstand lots of play time by little hands. Will be sure to order from this seller again. Thanks!"
1,WRONG SET SHOWN,"This seller is a great person, and honest, she listed this product at a great price. But when I received it, it was not the set that is pictured. Amazon, continues to show this picture with other sellers as well. I have tried to purchase it twice since, but contacted the sellers first. It is Amazon's responsibility to show a picture of the product, not the sellers, therefore you are buying the wrong set. I recommend that you contact the sellers and have them verify the set before you purchase. The set that you will receive is the ""Deluxe"" version that does not have Touch-N-Feel characters and it only has 12 characters (no cat). The one you want has a cat and characters with furry heads. The seller refunded me promptly, and sent me a return label. Amazon needs to correct this problem. In the meantime, I am still trying to find the set that is pictured at a good price. So if anyone actually has this set please contact me at nanc@norvellfixture.comThanks!"
5,great set!,"I purchased this for my 16 month old grandson for Christmas 2012.My 35 year old son called me to say ""Mom, this is the coolest nativity set ever!"" He loved it!It's very sturdy so my grandson couldn't break the little people. They are also VERY cute. It's a nice big set with all the animals, and the manger scene.Thanks, Fisher Price, for one more quality toy!!WJNP.S. I purchased a second set for my younger son and his wife, even though they don't have children yet. Someday, when they have kids, I'll give them the second set. (I was afraid I might not be able to find another set in a few years.)"
5,Great Nativity for little ones,"I bought this Nativity set for our grandson. He has thoroughly enjoyed all the characters and is learning the animal sounds. His favorite part is removing the angel, pushing the button and listening to the music. It is a great set for toddlers and preschoolers."
5,Perfect Planner,This appointment book meets my needs to a tee. It is not too bulky and fits in my bag perfectly. I particularly like the weekly 15 min. intervals. It is just what I need for my business. The only thing I would love to see is a faux leather cover in a different color - prefer red. Great buy for the money!
4,as advertized,"This vac was all it promised. it did come with some minor marks and dings, but it still preformed excellent. In fact it pulled a couple of pounds of that darn ""carpet cleaning"" powder out of our living room carpet that the old vac couldn't get out. we didn't know it was even in there. The kids enjoy using it becauses its fun to watch the dust and stuff swirling around inside (a little added bonus for us parents) Don't hesitate to buy this vac, it really cleans up."
2,Not up to expectations,"I ordered this mainly based on the glowing reviews. I am disappointed, however, and am now returning it. I don't think anything is wrong with the vacuum cleaner, but it hasn't done anything the two I already own don't do. It's also very heavy, which makes it hard to push around. I guess I'll stick with my 15-year-old Hoover canister vac for now."
2,Complete junk,"This vacuum is complete junk, and I believe the company is now out of business anyway. Can't find parts for it either."
3,Fantom Thunder power problem,"I own a Fantom and I love the way it picks up the dirt, and the bagless feature. However, the darn thing keeps shutting down for no reason and I have to unplug it for a time and plug it back in. We've taken it apart and found no apparent reason for it stopping. I only get about 2-3 minutes of vacuuming before it powers down. I've tried to reach the company but they seem to be out of business now. Does anybody know their status or have you experienced the same problem?"
5,if you want a thing bad enough to go out and fight for it...,"this book was outstanding when les first handed it (signed) to me back at a motivational speaking/business seminar many many years ago that i was also speaking at...and it is just as grande and effective now. the ditty 'if you want a thing bad enough...' became a personal motto. i have learned to 'be unreasonable' in my expectations of myself...knowing that 'no matter how many times life knocks you down...if you can look up, you can get up!' i managed at 35 to get into the army, and then to surpass not only what was expected of my age group in fitness (APFTs)...but also of better than half of those 10 years my junior! it has very much become this soldiers credo...and too now is effecting others as i continue to preach it.i would highly recommend this book to just about anyone."
5,Good News for Modern Man,"Les Brown is a great motivator. His writing style is easy to read and right to the point. Les has an interesting background, coming from poverty and literally pulling himself up by the bootstraps to achieve success as a state legislature, disc jockey, and motivational speaker/writer.Les wraps each of his lessons into stories of actual people who have demonstrated the feasibility of his theories for success. His message throughout is to ""take control of your life,"" and ""say Yes to life."" This book was written in 1992 but is timeless. His stories and lessons are not specific to any industry, business, or religious beliefs, and would be suitable for any reader--young adults included.You may also want to read ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napoleon Hill and ""The 17 Principles of Creating Wealth"" by Phillip Collinsworth."
2,"""You Gotta Be Greedy!""","The first chapter of this preachy book would more aptly be entitled ""The Incredible Ego of Les Brown"". Although the writing style is good, seldom in my experience has the obvious been stated so boastfully, as though it were a revelation.One wonders how anyone would benefit from Mr. Brown's self aggrandizing anecdotes, though they are mildly entertaining."
2,OK book,"Lots of catchy buzz words, maybe some interesting personal experiences, but not much how-to stuff here. Anyone looking for inspiration would be pretty much better off reading something by Zig Ziglar."
5,Awesome Book from Les Brown,"This is an AWESOME book from Les Brown. Very inspirational. Challenges you to ""live your dreams."" Les shares his personal experiences so you don't feel alone in facing the challenges that come with trying to have a better life. I recommend the book for all age groups! Purchase it for a friend or family member that you care about."
4,Lively brass sound,"If you are familiar with Drum Corps International, you will truly enjoy this album. The first thing that comes to mind is the Blue Devils. These are familiar songs orchestrated in much the way you would hear them on the field. Actually, I am extremely curious if these musicians are not all former Blue Devils members.The group is not that tight musically, but they are all good players and the arrangements are smooth and have a nice groove. I enjoyed it and would recommend other albums by this group if any exist."
3,Average,"After using the Battlefield 2 keyset for about a week:Overall I enjoy using this keyset, as it makes it easier to find keys that you don't normally use. The quality of the keyboard is good, and it has a nice feel to it.The only negative that I can say is that it is not as easy to use when you are trying to send messages to other players, as the keyboard is designed slightly differently (shorter space bar is the biggest issue).I think after using it for a few more weeks, the above will not be as much of an issue."
3,Supernatural live: Santana,I bought it and the music was good. Would have enjoyed it more in HD. I will not buy another product that is not HD-blue ray
5,Classical Carlos,Carlos brings with him an outstanding collection of artists who inspire and energize the viewer. He mixes his guitar solos with a band (and guest performers) who amazed me with their talents and passion for great music. A joy to watch. I only wish I could have been at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium to be part of the experience!!
3,"Santana is great, but DVD had problems","Wife and I love Santana, so were very disappointed to find that the recording quality of this DVD was poor. Distorted picture and sound at times...maybe we just recieved a bad copy. I would recommend this IF the quality is just an isolated occurance, becuase the content was great."
3,"Its Carlos but not the ""Old Carlos""","I would not say this dvd is ""Mezmerizing,"" or ""The best ever!"" No way. I didn't see the early Santana band from the 1st 3 albums, but I did see Carlos in 1975, 76, 78, 79, 82, 90 and 2000. I loved the old Carlos Santana when he would rip on the guitar and his music was ""Street/Latin/Rock!"" It was straight up ""Chicano Rock!"" It had a Latin rock groove and every song had ripping guitar work. His 1st 3 albums leaned more towards a hard rock sound. I saw the Supernatural concert here in Portland and I loved it. But I didn't buy the cd bcz it was all Spanish cumbias and every song sounded like a Tejano dance group. Sure, you could say that he's growing and he does what he does, yes I've heard it before and I agree with that. It's just too bad he doesn't rock like he used to. Us early Santana fans miss that. I miss songs like ""Taboo,"" ""Toussaint,"" ""Flor D Luna,"" ""Shades of Time,"" and the entire Santana 3 album... Thats the Carlos I miss."
2,High expectations lead to disappointment.,"First let me say that I'm a Carlos Santana fan. No one plays Carlos' signature riffs better than Carlos himself. But ask him to play something outside of his comfort zone and Carlos is a fair to middling guitarist at best, especially when you consider he's been playing guitar for over 50 years. His attempts to add something with acoustic guitar to songs like Sarah McLachlan's ANGEL failed miserably. He looked lost during song intervals that ""begged"" for guitar riffs and when he did play, the riffs were amaterish and distracted from the song. And the fact that his solos are limited to about a dozen signature riffs wouldn't be so bad if he didn't insist on making the solos so long accompanied by facial expressions designed to convince us of the ""supernatural"" effort behind them."
5,Dads gonna love it,"Aw yeah, I don't know what to type here, santana's awesome, about to hit my word limit, consider yourself reviewed!"
5,Santana fans this one for you,"The day i saw this DVD my whole day was great from the music expirence i have lived with santana . The best thing is the DTS sound & ofcourse the unique style of santana`s music , he`s the master of lead guitar , but i missed 2 songs El farol & corazon espinado. 2 thumbs up."
3,"Santana live, or was it?","I have been a Santana fan for almost 40 years. It is impossible to have continuity for that long. Chicago, the band, for instance, has most of the major players from the 1st band, yet it is very different today, with two new lead singers. Santana on this DVD is there, up front. Yet, with different lead singers than the original, and with a different breakdown of the percussion section than the 1st iteration, there is something imperceptible that is lacking.To be brief, I was prepared to love this DVD album but found it mediocre. If you are a fan of the original band with its driving rhythms and lilting vocals, save your money. There may not be anything available except the Woodstock film or other concerts that they did years ago. Good luck."
2,Not as good as it could be,The quality and sound of this DVD are truly great. The performance and venue are subpar. The guests were unnecessary although it makes for an accurate rendition of the CD performance. Overall this DVD is a struggle to sit through the whole thing without flipping forward to find the good parts.
2,Ok,"This is an ok video. I don't like the songs performed here though. I don't like what Santana is doing lately either. Why is so impossible to get a DVD like ""BEST OF MUSIKLADEN 1971"" and this DVD is everywhere? Chester Thompson plays so great Hammond Organ solos, but GREGG ROLIE will always be the greatest keyboardist that Santana ever had. And after him, Tom Coster.I would like to know if Santana is interested in his old fans to release a DVD one day of a concert from 1970, 1971 or the Lotus era. Let's have a balance here. It's being released a video for every pop song lately but nothing from the stuff that makes him what he is and what he will be remembered. The fans he may have now will forget about him with the next ""best"" thing to come out in fashion, but we won't ;-)"
2,A Mixed Bag,I rented this thinking I may buy it. After watching I decided not to buy it. It is a mixed bag with Smooth being the best and the rest of it not that great. This one did not make my top 20 dvd concert collection.
3,A nice mix of music,"There is a lot of good music on this DVD. And there's no denying that Santana is great at what he does. But he is not at his best here.He brings out a string of guest musicians, whom he does nothing more than accompany with some sporadic and terse guitar runs. He doesn't really seem to get into the performances at all.The performance is simply Santana's failed attempt to recapture his heyday.Still, it's worth having if you're a Santana fan. He could have left out the R&B; and hip hop pieces and it would have made for a much better compilation. But much of the music is fine."
3,NOT BAD,"well, for me this is Santana 'lite'. This is not the Santana I grew up with. Of course the musicians are good and the DVD is pretty good overall but it lacks bite. Is it any wonder the masses ate up the CD of the same name?! Easily digestible, just the way most people like their music. I laugh when I hear that Supernatural was Santana's 'comeback' CD, as if he actually went away. He never stopped making music, it was the audience who went away and then came back. Give Carlos credit though, for hooking up with the artists he did because that gave him wider appeal, hence the massive sales. I'll always have a soft spot for Carlos but I prefer the Santana that recorded their first 3 CDs. For me....THAT...was Santana!"
5,Wow....,"All, I can really say is wow. This book is what I have needed in my life. Thank you so much for writing it."
3,Decent little book,"This book shows the most common fossils of new york and goes into some detail about the time period in which the animals lived. I really needed something more comprehensive, but this guide is good for a small range of common fossils."
4,Highly recommend for beginners,"Although this book is a little outdated,if you are beginner with Boland C++ Builder,this book is just for you.It provides the fundamentals of C++Builder much enough.If you finish reading it, I recommend ""C++Builder HowTo"" as second step.PS. Day19, which explains DLL, is exceptionally bad, because some sample codes is not able to compile on BCB5.See ""C++ Builder5 Developer's Guide""."
3,Alright only for beginners,"This book is ok for beginners to introduce them to the BCB environment, but it does not teach you the c++ language. It will not take you a long time to learn BCB and after a while you will wonder why you spent so much money for a book that really doesnt teach you that much."
1,poor poor customer service,"i placed my order on sep 8th 2002, i have sent them 3 emails to check the status of the order. they have not answered one of them. do not buy anything through bookwizardus, that is my advice. spare yourself a bad experience."
3,Good for basics but not for advanced programmers,"This book covers only the basics and is good for people that haven't been working with c++ for a long period of time. It lacks severly on advanced topics. The book is a good way in to builder, a very good one indeed but when you feel like moving on you haven't got anything to move on to."
3,Good starter but no advanced topics or HOW-TO detail.,"This is a good book for the beginner C++Builder programmer. Don't look here if you are a fairly fluent to advanced C++ programmer looking to start using a Visual tool. Good guide to the basics of the IDE and general product components, constructions etc. No information on how to take a working C++ program and convert it to the C++Builder/Windows application."

3,"Great toy, but scoop broke!","My son loves this toy, but the string that makes the scoop lift & dump broke very soon after we got it. We replaced the string with some heavy-gauge fishing wire, which did the trick, but it's still a bummer that it broke so quickly.Both of our children love the pose-able figures and the bulldozer is a great size for toddlers/preschoolers. The paint and everything else on the toy held up great except for that scoop!Julie ArtzToysNaturally.com"
1,Third One and The Scoop Broke AGAIN!,This is the third time we've ordered this and the scoop string either breaks or the scoop mechanism is broken when we open it. Every time it's been for a birthday so you can imagine how disappointed my kids were when I told them we had to return it.
3,decent camera protection for when it's raining.,"Works well to protect the camera from rain. Had to use this a couple times on my recent trip to Alaska. My only problem is it takes some time to get this thing on the camera properly, once it's on it's difficult to manipulate the lens zoom. Also if you're using a shorter lens then this thing is pretty much pointless since there's too much excess sleeve and nowhere to put it. The product itself is a high quality plastic too, not cheap like a grocery store bag.Small and compact, folded up tiny and shoved it in my backpack, acted as extra padding for my lenses. :)It worked great with the Canon 40d and Canon 70-200mm f/2.8L IS lens.It worked good with the 40d and Canon 17-40mm f/4.0L.I gave up trying with my 40d and Canon 50mm f/1.8."
5,very good,"Excellent so far, very usable. I would buy a few more of these just to have as backups. Definitely would do business with them again."
3,Good to have,"it is good to have a rainsleeve,you get what you pay for,it does the work but not professionally designed.good but not perfect"
4,Good defense,"What can I say, a good protector, but for this price the manufacturer could put two more pieces in the set, as they are perishable."
3,OK in a Pinch,"I'll keep these handy when using my Canon T3i and 100mm macro, but they are really too much for a standard lens. I'll keep them in my bag for an emergency, but doubt I'll use them much."
5,Keep it for camera safety in downpours,I bought this sleeve to allow me to take pictures in bad weather. I live in Seattle in the Northwest which is known for constant rain. I plan on using this for my D300 with a lens as large as 18-200mm. It is essentially a plastic bag with elastic around your arm and the lens. Another plus is that they fold up into your bag. Each bag contains two of them
4,a bit longer for my cannon camera,"I have a Cannon camera with a long lens built in. Even with the lens in full telephoto it is still long, but I think I could make this work for me."
4,Not bad for the price,Just got this so I haven't yet used it but was happy with the weight of the plastic. Seems to be just what I want to have in my bag for emergency. Bought it to take on an Alaskan cruise because of their frequent rains. Don't think it will be great for a downpour but it should be good protection for those times when it starts to rain lightly in the middle of a shoot. I like the hole for the eye piece. Snapping the eye piece over the hole keeps the bag in place. Play with it a bit to get the hang of extending your lens in the plastic so you aren't fumbling on the first shoot. Think this will do the job. Item came fast in sturdy box.
3,Works only so-so,"Nice concept, but the sleeve's viewing hole kept slipping off my Canon viewfinder eyepiece. I couldn't figure out a means to keep the little opening aligned with the eyepiece. It's darn difficult to see through wet plastic! May be best suited for use with long telephoto lenses. My camera body stayed dry, but water drops still got on the front of my lens with a short lens hood. A drawstring holds the sleeve in place on the lens."
5,a must have,works just what they say it will.. good construction and materials works just what they say it will.. good construction and materials
2,Not worth your money,You can get similar result by using a grocery bag. I feel so stupid paying $6 for two such bags. Don't buy them.
2,It is a touch thicker than a plastic bag from a grocery store,"Ok yeah so it was cheap.. however.. it is something that would be in a dollar store for a dollar. At least they give you two of them. And the string is good quality. But the bag... wow.. it is very cheap quality plastic.. like the title of my review says, it is a little bit thicker than a grocery store's plastic bag. I recommend paying a little more and getting a rain cover that is of a thicker material and not a plastic bag like this.I gave it two stars because there were two bags in the package not just one and it is ok for a lightweight carry around bag, just in case you have your camera out and it starts raining."
3,I have not used this Sleeve yet,"However, once again I received this item very quickly. There was no issues of damage to the product at all. Once I use it I'll be sure to update my review."
4,Too big for my camera,"This 18"" rain sleeve is really for a huge sports camera, not for a Nikon P510. Sorry I had to send it back, but I didn't want to cut it up to fit. It was just way too much plastic to use with my camera."
1,nothing but plastic bag,"Do not buy this. It is just a plastic bag. The product pic looks cool though, don't be fooled. Just use any plastic bag instead."
4,It's a good thing to keep handy,Works pretty good.. Easy to store away for a rainy day.. I would definitely recommend it to anybody who likes to be prepared for any situations that may pop up... Worth the price all day.....
1,Poor vender!,I never recieved this item! Nonexistant customer service! Do not do business with these people.
2,peek a boo review,This product was an ok purchase. The top didn't fit as well as hoped. But still was ok.
1,This is a bad martial arts DVD,"The adaptive techniques that are shown in this DVD aren't that very impressive or practical, except for two good ones. When Jerry Meyers executes the techniques, he does so without speed or fluidity, his explanations are disjointed and lack specifics. Disregard the review of the person who trained under Jerry Meyers for 30 years, it is extremely bias and is not objective."
3,This albulm is O.K.,"If you've never listened to alkaline trio before do not get this albulm, its ok i guess, but it is nothing compared to goddamnit! or self-titled"
4,It's all relative,"I think this album is not up to par with their prior work, its not even in the same ballpark. I think they turned away from being ""punk"" and it's definetly more of a straightforward rock album and many songs blend together. It's missing that edge that all their previous albums had. I think the lyrics aren't as much fun (that is darkly humorous), the voices sound dulled and the music is much too bland. Upon first listen I just kept waiting for those lyrics that made me smirk or some emotion to register in the voices, but it never came, the edge is missing. But at the same time if you compare this album to most music out there I still think its better than most, its just not up to the standards AK3 have built for themselves with being so brilliant to this point."
4,"41/2, but it's still a must own for trioheads.","Alkaline Trio is back again. After 2003's successful ""Good Mourning"", the band has finally shifted into a new direction. And that new direction? More rhythum, not so much punk rock. The dark lyrics, allthough present on this album, are not nearly as dark as the Alk 3 we are all use too. This album is also 99% curse free, minus one s word. Strange for the Alkaline Trio.Time To Waste is by far the best song on the album, and the first single. But other great songs include ""Burn"", ""I Was A Prayer"", ""Mercy Me"", ""Deathbed"", and ""Sadie"". But this whole album sparks a much different turn for the Alkaline Trio.Someone told me awhile ago that this album is what thier last sounded like, and they went back into the studio and changed it at the last minute. Intersting. Well ""Crimson"" is a great album, and is very much an Alkaline Trio album, I can't help but say that ""Good Mourning"" was a better album, as well as all the other albums."
2,Ak3 get an Unsatisfactory in the Effort department,"I have always been a fan of the Alkaline Trio, but with this album they just seem to be going through the motions. Crimson, like Ak3's recent Good Mourning, lacks the raw energy and lyrical wit of their previous releases. Of the newer Ak3 releases, From Here to Infirmary is the most coherent, since it combines solid songwriting and energy of prior releases with slick production. These songs just seem uninspired. I want the Ak3 that made me feel the hangovers, envision a baby crack from work related stress, and taste sour home Chicago."
3,Chitling Soup,This album is mediocore....a little over produced....a little too clean and poppy...not lyrically mysterious enough....and by far the worst album the trio have made...I love alkaline trio and still do....just wish they would have spent more time making a decent album like the first three
4,This album really isnt horrible,"i have listened to crimson a couple times through now and to be honest it really isnt horrible true it may not be good as some of their earlier efforts such as good mourning, or from here to the infirmery but hey everyband eventually starts to grow up and grow out of their old music.. its just that alkaline trio is starting to mature and in accordance with that their albums are going to be different for example to take another band that this very same thing happend to is green day, they went from dookie to warning to american idiot all of which are different then dookie but we all still seem to to like Green Day."
4,Better to experience these guys live!!,"Oh man, i saw Alkaline Trio in DC a few weeks ago and they were amazing. They breathed life into some of the less living tracks on the new cd and some of the old ones as well. A high point for me was the crowd singing along to ""This Could Be Love."" Great show, go see 'em live it makes the new album much more listener friendly."
2,sadness,"The one thing I can say this album is it reminded me of why I used to like old, defunct bands that have broken up already. To hear the alkaline trio record something like this is like watching your pet dog you've had for 7 years get hit by a car, both of which are slightly less painful than seeing them on MTV made up like the killers. The only song i do like on this album is ""If we never go outside..."", and it still pales in comparison to the band I fell in love with and got tattooed on me 5+ years ago. If you have any sense, buy one of their first 3 releases (Goddamnit, S-T, Maybe I'll Catch Fire.) If you're a big fan such as I, you have to buy this, but dont say I didn't warn you. I'm going into my room now to put on Goddamnit for the 40,000th time, and pretending this album doesn't exist."
2,Boring overall,"I've gotten to the point now where i just download singles and make mixtapes. ""crimson"", as with most rock records these days, carries more fillers than killers. Mercy me and Time to waste are exceptional, but the rest fall short. One after another song just fails to meet the expectations set by Time and Mercy, and at the end, you're left wondering how ""crimson"" even made it past pre-production. If you're a typical top 40 buyer, you've probably grown used to the trend of 5 or more fillers per record, but if you're more into those solid 10 track indie epics, you've come to the wrong place."
5,"Stop Complaining, it's good, take it at that","I honestly don't get this, they change their sound and everyone and their brother starts talking about how Alkaline Trio ""sold out"", blah blah blah. Now if they had never changed their style, these same idiots would go on about ""every album's the same they never get better"" and all that worthless junk.Face it, Crimson is a very good CD, is it like their old stuff? No. Is it better? I think so.Bands grow up, change and mature, if they didn't we'd end up with thousands of Blink 182's and worthless stuff like that, no one wants that.It is a good CD take it at that or only buy artists first CD's bands are gonna change deal with it.Crimson is worth whatever you need to pay for it, period."
4,Solid.,"This is one album you can buy and expect to listen too all the way through and not get bored. Although it's not as dark as previous albums, Alkaline trio has not lost thier edge by ANY means. In my opinion, musically they change for the better every album, while being consistent in their upbeat yet edgy lyrics."
4,"crimson, and other alkaline trio albums","With ""Good Mourning"", most of Dan's songs were stronger than Matt's songs. It's the opposite with ""Crimson"". ""Crimson"" is much better than ""Good Mourning"", and about equal to ""From Here to Infirmary"". Although ""Goddamnit"" has the most raw emotion, it's a little too raw and sloppy for me, but that's because I'm a perfectionist. ""Maybe I'll Catch Fire"" wasn't as sloppy, but still had a lot of raw emotion. ""Maybe I'll Catch Fire"" was just underproduced enough to sound authentic and not glossy, as their last three albums have sounded. ""Maybe I'll Catch Fire"", ""From Here to Infirmary"", and ""Crimson"" are equally good in different ways."
4,confessions,"I must confess that I only bought this album so that I could be somewhat acquainted with Alkaline Trio before attending a My Chemical Romance concert where they would be playing. I fell in love with this band the instant I popped the cd in. The lyrics are very deep and the music is fantastic. I listened to the cd non stop until I had learned every word. It set a tone and a standard for a lot of my own writing. I haven't heard anything else that Alkaline has put out, but this album made me a fan. It's a must for anyone looking for some good gothic, melodic, easy rock music. Highly enjoyable."
2,Decline,"By far the trio's worst album, they started at the top of a hill and have fallen significantly with every album."
3,Organization could be better,"The information seems pretty thorough, but Fizzell has organized the book mainly by types of plants -- vegetables, annuals, perennials, trees, and so on -- and then month-by-month under each group. So when you're trying to figure out what to do in May, you have to look up ""May"" under ""Annuals,"" then ""May"" under ""Perennials,"" then ""May"" under ""Trees"" .... I'd much rather he'd used the months as main categories, and each type of plant as a subcategory of those.And Fizzell is pesticide- and herbicide-crazy! Forget it if you're an organic gardener. (I'm still looking for a book on organic gardening in Michigan.)"
2,Usefull for timing reference is LP,"The timing info in this book is useful, if you live in Michigan's average area. Skip it if you live in Northern Michigan. Very little of the timing will apply to you. One other thing I didn't like was how many chemicals (of various sorts) they tell you to dump on your lawn. Every month it seems like they're telling you it's time to put one or two more on your lawn or in your beds. This type of gardening is not for me, and it scares me to think that people just strating with gardening might read this and think that they are all necessary."
2,"Reillustrated ""If Jesus Came to My House"" disappoints","Not seeing Jesus in the reillustrated version of ""If Jesus Came To My House"" took away the entire meaning of the book. I have purchased many copies of the original volume and I was very disappointed to see the illustrations in the revised edition. Nothing was improved upon in the reillustrated volume. Make no mistake, it is the original for me.Lola J. SellIndian River, Mi"
5,lesson for life,I remember this book as a child and think it taught me many lessons that I use in life. Excellent for all kids and adults.
2,New book looks used,The book is wonderful but in shipping or otherwise the books (3 copies) that we give away as gifts were dirty and looked used (but purchased as new!!Not happy!!
4,For all ages,"A sweet book (sentimental from my childhood) about how we all should treat others. ""Love thy neighbor as thyself"". Excellent book for children."
5,There is no real Saxon anymore,"Saxon broke up - get over it. The only REAL saxon included Byford, Oliver, Dawson, Quinn and Gill. That Saxon is no more. Biff uses the name, but it's not really Saxon.So we have 2 completely ""new groups"". One has the voice (and the name ""Saxon""), and the other the music. On a blind listen, any discerning listener would rate ODS as the superior band. Oliver and Dawson contributed so much to the sound and the legend of Saxon. And that ""true"" saxon sound is here in this DVD.No real Saxon fan would ever criticise Oliver and Dawson. Why not just enjoy their music?"
1,Doesn't play,"Can't comment on the concert amazon has it listed as NTSC but it turned out to be PAL formatted. UPC 8712273110486. :(I am referring to the version with the band on the cover. I have yet to try the ""skull"" cover version or the Angel Air DVD which specifically stated on their website that two versions exist:NJPDVD603 (PAL Version)NJPDVD603N (NTSC Version)Last look on amazon had the Angel Air released ""O/D Saxon - Rock Has Landed: It's Alive"" DVD as out of print."
2,Saxon - 'Rock Has Landed - It's Alive' (MVD) Running time: 65 minutes,"Nice try,guys!Main reason I'm giving this hour long DVD a two-star rating is the price.Obviously,this DVD title isn't moving.Wonder WHY?Could it BE that guitarist Graham Oliver and bassist Steve Dawson CHOSE to go under the Saxon monicker WITHOUT vocalist/frontman Biff Byford?Might possibly be.This DVD is quite a let down,I'm sorry to say.You need to look at the cover REAL good and notice that it reads 'Oliver/Dawson' above where it reads Saxon. Tunes played here live,such as ""Eagle Has Landed"", ""Power And The Glory"", ""747"" and ""Devil Rides Out"" are so-so, I guess. It's just simply not the same without Biff. An audio CD of this show would likely be easier to accept. For completists only, I'm afraid. Hope you get more from this DVD than I did."
1,Are you serious?,"I give this DVD 1 star, and that's only because I had to....this is soo bad. Yes, Oliver and Dawson were original members of Saxon and to see them reduced to performing w/ the likes of that singer (does he want to be Gary Glitter in the worst way or what?)is really sad to see.$10 bucks says that the people who gave postive reviews of this DVD are either in ODS or their friends."
1,Oliver-Dawson Saxon: you must be joking....,"YOu must be joking. Steve Dawson left SAxon years ago. Some yeasr later, Graham Oliver did the same. So, out of the blue, they decid their have the right to use the name SAXON??!!! are they out of their minds?This is a sad DVD."
5,Start Here,"Fairly quick, but vitally important read to anyone studying the media, communication, and politics. Experimental design demonstrates the media has the ability to set the national agenda, prime what people think is important within issues, and frame the way we think about the world. This is the seminal and original work in the field."
5,Samsung SYNC SGH-A707 Elite Leather Case,I think I like the case more than the phone. It's a good buy.
3,Disappointed,"I selected this cd for the traditional, old-time gospel songs and music. The arrangements and the words are not the traditional songs. It is an ok cd--I was expecting sometime different."
4,It's all right,"It's all right, it's mainly about Phillip Pullman and not as much about the book. Kind of lame graphics and reuses lots of the same pictures/video clips but it doesn't take away from how informative it is. I hate how people like the other ""reviewer"" jhteacher (if you can call him a reviewer, he's just some moron who probably hasn't even read those books to make up his own mind). The books are wonderful and this dvd gives you some interesting background information about everything. I even consider myself a Christian, yet I still love Pullman's books."
4,weekend treats,"This small book contains only 30 recipes that are perfect for those ""breakfasts in bed"" or treating your family to something sweet and savory on the weekend. I thought the recipes were easy to follow and many of the recipes can be prepared in less than 30 minutes. I like the color photographs, but most important, I like the fact that I can plan, prepare, bake or freeze the recipes in advance. Weekends will never be comprised of cold cereal or plain pancakes again thanks to this tasty book."
5,Delicious,"Freshly baked breakfast food is wonderful, and this book provides the process for bringing fresh organic ingredients to life. The lemon-almond-blueberry muffins are excellent. We are going to try the coffee cake soon."
2,Neither fish nor fowl & not what I expected,"Every weekend my family and I cook at least one big breakfast together. I collect breakfast& brunch cookbooks, because we are always ready to try something new. I found this book overpriced for the thirty recipes which it contains, although the accompanying photographs are nice. The recipes themselves are pretentious, and require ingredients or combinations of ingredients that are not in most pantries, unless you work for Dean & Delucca. Saffron, thick-cut Seville marmalade, ripe peaches, steel-cut oats, sea salt and Stilton cheese. These ingredients are obtaintable in cities of 85,000 and over, or online, but it is necessary to plan ahead. No spontaneity in the morning allowed here! The author must have realized this at some point, or why would she have included yet another recipe for pancakes, for waffles and for the ubiquitous sticky bun? Borrow this book from the library and try some of the quick breads, then return it."
3,Buyer Beware!!!,"I bought this vacuum aboot 4-5 months ago. The biggest problem I've run into is that if the 2 filters are not kept absolutely clean, the vacuum clogs. Even worse the company is now out of business. I tried getting replacement filters from my local store and they told me they can't get them because Fantom is out of business. Go figure Enron and now Fantom! So I've been left to devise my own rigged filters to keep this thing running. My wife will never let me choose appliances again!!!Thanks Fantom."
1,Beware,The vacuum worked well for two weeks. Then I had to return the vacuum beacuse the motor burnt up. Tried calling Fantom and they no longer answer their phones.
2,Don't buy this vacuum..clogs easily,"I have the Fantom Fury, it worked really well when it was new, but now (2 years later) its really fragile. The filter has to be cleaned (w/water and air dried) every time I vacuum the floor since the vacuum looses serious suction ability if the filter(s) are not perfectly clean.I bought a bagless vacuum so I wouldn't have to worry about the vacuum everytime I used it. That is no longer the case and is really a pain in the neck.Go buy a hoover..!"
1,I hate this vacuum!,"I bought this to replace a 5 year old Fantom Thunder which I loved. At first, the Crosswind really seemed superior but after a couple of days, it quit working. Thinking it was defective, I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one. Had the exact same problem! The store will not do anything and Fantom just sent me an email telling me how to check for a blockage. There is no blockage. There is a filter that has to be washed after nearly after vacuuming and it must be air dried for 24 hours before using again. This vacuum is a good concept but very poor design. Nothing but a pain and I have lost nearly 300 dollars on it!"
1,Pet Hair Hell,"The Crosswind 600XL does not come up to the usual quality that I have come to expect from Fantom. I sold my Fury and Thunder to upgrade to the Crosswind. Worst mistake I ever made! I have 1 cat and 1 dog. The Fury and the Thunder handled the pethair effortlessly. The Crosswind will only run 5 mins before the automatic shut off kicks in because it overheats. You have to wait 30 mins before it will restart. Spent the whole afternoon trying to vacuum a livingroom, diningroom and hallwy. I'm awaiting Europro's response now that they have taken over what was once a good product."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"This is the worst cleaner that I have ever purchased!! It over heats constantly, needs to be cleaner after ""EVERY USE"", and is just a plain piece of [garbage]!!"
1,Absolute JUNK,"What good is a product that you cannot get service on.I have called the 800 number and was told ""THE OFFICE WAS CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE"".The web site is shut down and here i sit with a $150.00 piece of ""JUNK"". Might I SUGEST YOU LOOK INTO THIS BEFORE YOU TRY TO UNLOAD ANY MORE OF THESE ON ANYONE ELSE.I await a replyDaniel ORourke 02/08/2002"
2,Good for 1 year.,Basically this vacuum is falling apart after 18 months. The headlights lasted 3 months ( not a big deal) but now the brush doesn't even spin. So much for doing carpets. If you want to buy a new expensive vacuum every year or so this one is for you.
1,Al,"I bought similar model about two years ago and it is already broken. It has cheap plastic parts, the service is very bad. I went to fantom site and placed my order for replacement parts and it has been over 3 month and I didn't receive any parts. I am going to go and buy a new vacuum cleaner and not to deal with this company anymore.I don't have any recomendations for what type of vacuum cleaner to buy, but don't buy Fantom."
5,Best One,"First of all, my vacuum has worked perfectly. I only clean mine after my canister is full and it works perfectly. Your house must be very, very dirty. What are you talking about you can't get filters, go to Fantom.com, and order them. Fantom was only taken over by Euro-Pro. As for a manual go tho Fantom.Com again. Anyone who has a problem with this vacuum cant take care of it and their house must be filthy. Fantom is one of the best brands there is in vacuums. As for buying a cheaper kenmore or hoover, thats idiotic. Any vacuum under 179.99 is typically very cheaply made and is a an imitation. Kenmore and hoover use cheap plastic, motors and parts."
1,STAY AWAY,"I had once purchased a Fantom Fury, I like most everyone, loved it at first. I was amazed at how well it picked everything up. Within a month I started to have problems, the thing broke. I contacted Fantom for a replacement, instead they ""insisted"" on walking me through step by step on the phone how to fix it. It didn't work. I was given incredible run arounds on returning it for a replacemnt. They wanted me to have it serviced, I insisted on a replacement. Bottom line, they were impossible to deal with. Even the top managers just didn't care. They begrudgingly sent me another one, but first I had to ship the old one at MY OWN expense. Yeah, they sent me another one, in a ripped up box, obviously a used vaccuum. That one too, ultimately broke within a few months. Don't waste your money on junk, the Fantom company are thieves. period."
1,Very disappointed in this one!!!!!,"5 years ago, for a wedding gift, my husband and I recieved a Fantom Fury. It was wonderful and really still kind of is, except I cannot get the hose to work anymore. I bought this Fantom Crosswind off my boss and to say the least, I paid MUCH more for it than it is worth! I didn't get a manual, so I don't even have any idea what to look for as the problem. The thing does not suck and when I can get it to pick anything up, it usually overheats and everything I sucked up, falls out of it! I am very disappointed in this vacuum since I liked my Fury so much. I should have gone to Sears and bought a Kenmore! would have been cheaper at least!"
1,lasted less than a month,"yes I bought this item before I read all of these reviews. The vacuum did well at first, I really liked using it until one day it shut off and would not come back on, I could not understand why because I kept the filters very clean and I had only had it for less than a month. I will not ever buy another fantom."
2,Don't buy a fantom,I had always heard about Fantom's! Thought they were wonderful! When searching for a new vacuum we ran across the Fantom Wildcat! We thought we were getting a deal! All it does is CLOG!!!! You can't even get to the beater brush without tearing it apart with 3 strong men and TOOLS! It gets cleared out....runs for one more run...and CLOGS! We thought...wow never buy bags again.....never buy a belt again. We were sure snowed! Then we thought...let's buy a new beater brush....we can just order directly. NO WRONG! They don't exist anymore. Great customer service! Stick to the names that have been around for a long time........Hoover....Eureka......Etc. I am sure they will be taking care of you. Now we have to go back to the drawing board and buy another new vacuum.
1,"Great when new, but...","We bought a Fantom 3 years ago and it was great when it was new. After about a year the accessories broke. It also has problems with clogging the internal ports in the machine. It is unfortunate, I really liked it when it worked. It was very expensive, too."
5,A Gem of a Book,"I have purchased this book approximately 4 times in the last 30 years. The reason being I lend it to friends and I never get it back. This book is a classic and should be given to everyone in high school and should be required reading. The title has is not in anyway a description of the subject of this book, in my opinion. Each chapter is a pearl of wisdom that if taken to heart will help you through many a rough patch in your life at any age. I most especially love the last chapter and have often recited it to myself over the years. Please do yourself a huge favor and purchase this book. I absolutely promise you will not be disappointed."
2,Reader from PA,"Oh what can I say about this book, except it has absolutely nothing to do with lovers being friends at all. I don't know how it got that title, had a few nice things in it about friends and some good advice here and there, but it just was not what I thought it would be at all."
4,nice boots,"These are nice quality boots for the price. They are a little stiff at first and quite tall, but on a large horse are just right.Protective cuffs at bottom don't seem that they will wear out any time soon. Worth the price."
4,Very well written,"True to form, Fleeman does a fabulous job recreating the life and death of the victim and his murderess. My only complaint is, when I pay full price for a book, I expect it to be free of spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors...and this was not. I believe the fault lies in the conversion to the Kindle format because, for example, the name OLLIE is consistently written as 011IE - the letters O and L being read as the numbers 0 and 1 instead. There are also MANY misplaced periods, which interupt the flow when reading. The word ""detective"" was missing several letters as well.However, these types of errors are HUGE pet peeves of mine and may not be as bothersome to others.The photo quality in the Kindle version is also HORRIBLE. I don't think the person responsible for the conversion even bothered to edit it afterwards, and unfortunately I've seen this way too much in this format of Feeman's books."
3,This was a good read.,I enjoyed this story. I would have rated 3.5 to close to a 4 maybe. But I try to be conservative. Worth the purchase.
4,Maynard Shows his stuff....again,"Well, the Boss has reinvented himself again. This is more standard type pieces than his old showtune stuff, and he again shows off his range, but also his soloing ability more so than in his older albums.The Big Bop Nouveau group again shows why they're part of the elite. Staggering Solos and duets pepper this album. For you straight-ahead jazz types that before would steer away from Maynard, give this one a try. Who knows? Maybe you'll find a new appreciation for him. I did."
5,Good,The book came in great condition. Helped so much for my class. Strongly recommend if trying to learn biomechanics and physics.
1,misleading video,"The T V show ""Hail to the chief"" starring Patty Duke Astin is believed to be what is on the video. But only the 41 presidents is on the video. I have yet to get the TV show on video."
4,review on Pasion,"I bought this DVD of telenovela, couse I've seen it and I liked it, so I wanted to have it in my shelf in case i would like to wach it again.I like about this DVD that it is 950 min, so the movie is not shortened.Not nice things are:1. it does not have any other language subtitles.2. DVD packadge does not incloode anything else except 4 DVD's. If I am paying this money, I would like to have at least some photos of telenovela, actors."
3,No esta completa,Yo queria ver la novela completa como la anunciaron en la descripcion. Pero en realidad esta corta no tiene muchisimas partes. La unica razon que supe que pasaba fue por que ya habia visto la novela antes.
1,requeim from the darkness - turmoil lf the flesh (vol.1) + series box,"this is one of those scams they tell you about. this is one disck. and a box that holds 4 discks. you can buy the only dick in this set for much cheaper and not alot of extra cardboard.so to review, scam scam scam."
2,Useless as a cookbook,"I found this book useless as a cookbook. The techniques are way too complicated and the ingredients nearly impossible to attain unless you are a Korean farmer living in the countryside 60 years ago. Most Koreans don't live and cook like this book describes; it was a way of life for the privileged quite some time ago, and was not common even then.It's more of a food-related memoir, with many descriptions of life as a rich family in a small town in Korea in the early 20th century. The pictures are amateurish, blurry, and black and white. As Korean culinary history, it's interesting, but anyone trying to cook from it will be frustrated."
2,Growing up in a Korean Kitchen: A cookbook,"I was so disappointed with the book. It is not a cookbook, it is text book. It contains no color pictures; only color picture is the cover. A few picture in the book are black and white and very unappetizing."
2,What's up with the walnuts?,"To be fair, I've only made two recipes so far: the cucumber salad and the spinach salad. I should have known that something was not quite right when the recipe called for lemon juice and parsley, two ingredients that are never found in the Korean kitchen! Still, I toiled away for nearly 40 minutes, only to be told by my (very Korean) mother that it is too sweet and that I had wasted my time squeezing the cucumbers! She quickly threw together her Korean cucumber salad in about 10 minutes! Tasting them side by side, it really hit home that the version I made was definitely Americanized.So if you're looking for unnecessarily labor-intensive, Korean-fusion cookbook, then this is the one for you. If you're looking for a good, solid, everyday Korean food cooking, then this is NOT it.And what's up with the walnuts added to everything? My theory is that the author's family must have had a large walnut tree. ; )And yes, I am Korean for those of you wondering."
3,Not what I expected.,"I bought this book after I got married, in the hopes that it would save me from calling my mother every time I wanted to make dinner. This book uses too many fancy non-essential ingredients and seems to make everything a lot more complicated than it needs to be. I've tried several of the recipies but they don't even really taste like what I consider authentic Korean."
3,"Decent, but not the best.","I appreciate the thoroughness of the recipes but it's not really what I was looking for. For everyday meals, the recipes are somewhat inconvenient. I've had better luck finding recipes online. There are some great soup recipes in it so I'll definitely try my hand at one of those this winter."
4,Homestyle cooking at its best,I finally bought this cookbook after checking it out more than 5 times from the local public library. It has many traditional recipes that were fun to cook for my diverse family. We especially liked learning how to use korean spices to achieve complex flavors!!!! Yum!
5,A real gem,"This delightful little book is one of the gems in my large collection of cookbooks. The book suffers a little from not having much in the way of good illustrations but the rest of it makes up so much for this deficiency that I still feel it deserves five stars. The book contains a lot of detail about life in Korea and the author's childhood memories of food and it intersperses this autobiographical material with great recipes and a lot of very useful information about Korean ingredients and cuisine. When my wife went to Korea on a trip recently, I gave her this book to use as a food guide both in restaurants and in the markets. She found it very useful and I benefited myself as she was able to find and purchase quite a lot of ingredients for me that I would be hard pressed to find at home. I often browse through this book and enjoy it very much."
4,"Easy to understand, Great Recipes!",I wanted to continue growing my knowledge of Korean cuisine and this book helped me a lot. I love the history on the authors background as well it makes the recipes and food much more special. One thing that was lacking was more pictures of the food! I would have loved to see the end result of what the author had made. But all the same I got some really good recipes and new ideas on Korean food.
3,"Too complicated to use, too boring for food porn","I have at least half a dozen Korean cookbooks, and this is the only one that I don't use. Every recipe is at least twice as complicated and time consuming as the other recipes--many requiring ingredients that have been made days, weeks or months in advance. There's a lot of interesting info, but with very few pictures, color, and a bland design, you're not going to end up using this cookbook for much.However, if you aren't just looking to make Korean food and want old-fashioned, traditional recipes, this is definitely the book for you. I found it too complicated to use, but it was certainly interesting."
4,Reality or ?,Another fast moving thriller from Alex Abella where he again displays his unique ability to mingle reality with the supernatural. The reader is never quite sure until the very end. Mr. Abella also exhibits rare expertise in the social culture of his native Cuba and the innerworkings of the Los Angeles criminal justice system.
3,Disappointing end to Morrell trilogy,"""Final Acts"" tries to recapture the magic of the two books that preceeded it, especially ""Killing of the Saints"", but it fails in this regard. Charlie's voice in this looks like a novelization of what he had experienced while on the lam for a series of murders that he didn't commit. There's hints of a large shadow conspiracy, which tend to be a part of bad or meriocre novels. Most of the story is told by Charlie Morrell's lawyer, Rita Carr. She's an ok narrator, but nothing great. All in all, doesn't live up to the first two, but Charlie's riff on the Beatles song with ""Once there was a way..."" is brilliant, and the lone good part."
3,Five Books of Miriam,"While this is an entertaining book, I found it to be disappointing as a commentory on the Torah. Questions asked seemed to be rhetorical, because they were certainly not answered, especially the questions (asked several times) ""why does God treat us this way, why is He an unforgiving God?"" Some grave instances in the book seemed to be schlepped over, for instance, why does God kill two of Aaron's sons for offering fire? The fire was given in offering for the love of God? So why would God kill His children for offering love? Yes, I understand that this book offers insight to the amazing women in our Torah, but I felt we could have been far more rewarded with a more critical view of the Torah."
2,Interesting,"The title grabbed my attention, so I bought the book. Unfortunately, I was very underwhelmed, however, it is interesting. I would say Jewish women should like to at least read the book, as it and books like this can open the mind to new possibilities. It is always good to get other perspectives.What the Torah Teaches us About SurvivalCompanion Workbook to What The Torah Teaches Us About SurvivalWhat The Torah Teaches Us About Spirituality/ Through Isaac's Own Spiritual Journey"
3,Too short,"We had previously ordered the Tall Bariatric Offset Cane 500 pound capacity and were very pleased with it, but it was not available when we needed to reorder for my 6 ft 3 in husband. My husband noted that he still had some notches to go on the tall one and reasoned that this regular version would work out OK if fully extended. It really doesn't. He will keep the canes as a back up, but he has to hunch over to use them (he uses 2 canes) even when fully extended."
5,fun romance,"I loved the story and the writing. The plot was tight and full of action, no words wasted. Both characters were very real. I am happy to read a Kendrick novel where the heroine does not let the hero walk all over her!! Yeah!"
5,Excellent Text,Simply excellent introductory text of the subject. Turns is an excellent educator and author and makes the introduction to the subject as easy as possible. I used it as a grad student at Purdue and loved it.
5,"Great book, late delivery","This is a fantastic book. Highly recommended. However, didn't receive the book on time. The delivery took way too long and somewhat it was sent to the wrong address. It was really hard to get customer service support on this matter."
5,Amazing Book,I'm been reading this to my daughter since she was born....she LOVES it! I wish I could buy the whole series for her. The Pop-ups are cute and easy to distinguish between. Perfect for a young or older child.
4,From Copenhagen with love,"For the price is a very good after shave, with a balanced fragance. The only problem in that the ink cap in contact with the liquid become sticky."
5,Arche-Ambient,"Mellotron beds and washes abound, as do simple acoustic guitar textures; Richard Pinhas' electric leads throughout are even more dutifully Frippish and sinewy than on the debut. The synths are ardently and appropriately noodly. And 'Moebius' sounds like - - well, Dieter Moebius, of course. It all comes off so arch, in fact, that it's hard to take any of it seriously - - and that's good, as it's really music about other music. Meta-music? Bien sur, et c'est all about l'ambiance anyhoo."
4,GREAT BOOK,"It's a very good book for young women. I got it when I really became a teen and I loved it. Great book, not to overdone but simple and sweet and some great ideas in it too. Great book!"
2,Dont Waste Your Money,"When I bought this vacum, I had real high expectations because of previous Fantoms that I had owned in the past. Fantom has really gone downhill, because this thing is junk. First, it seems to clog up all the time, I am constantly cleaning the filter out. Second the piece that holds the floor attachment broke off when I slightly bumped something! So it must not of been very well put together! Im giving this thing 2 stars, which is being nice... go buy a Hoover!"
4,great old movie,This was a blast from the past I really enjoyed watching it again. It was one that I used to watch with my mom. My mom has passed away so I was able to remember her and watch a movie I loved as a kid.
5,"""By Myself"" documentary not on blu ray edition","Finally received the blu ray I've been waiting for and it looks and sounds amazing--BUT the American Masters documentary ""By Myself"" is not included,even tho it's listed on the back cover. What happened???"
5,Easter Parade is the Easter Serenade!!,"This motion picture, full of laughter, hapiness and wonderful music stars Judy Garland & Fred Astaire in their only film together. Judy plays Hannah Brown, a struggling ""cabaret-ish"" performer who is discovered by Don Hewes (Fred Astaire). As the minutes of this movie run you find romancetaking its roll and the wonderful music that accompanies this matsterpiece of Metro Goldwyn Mayer. This movie is one of the greatest musicals with no one better than Miss Judy Garland and Fred Astaire. Film Fact: Gene Kelly was to play opposite of Judy, but due to a broken leg suggested that they give the role of don Hewes to his good collegue Fred Astaire. Fred Astaire was in retirement at the time, but came out to work with Judy. All in all this film glorifies every aspect of the musical motion picture. I give you Judy Garland, Fred Astaire, Ann Miller, and Peter Lawford in Glorious Technicolor, Easter Parade 1948. Enjoy!!!"
3,The Old Pygmalion Story--Again!,"I love Fred and Judy as much as anyone, but this is really worth watching primarily for the stars and their numbers. The songs and performances are great, but the script lets them down--not particularly witty or original. It's the old Pygmalion story (again!), and most of the humor is leaden. For a musical-comedy, there's not much comedy. You can tell that the script was written primarily as a vehicle to use as many Berlin songs as possible. Perhaps the best number was deleted from the final film--Judy's stunning ""Mr. Monotany."" It's available on ""That's Entertainment III (and maybe on the bonus disc here?)."
5,Easter Parade,Love this classic Easter Holiday movie! We watch it every Easter after our meal. Previously on a VCR tape; now on DVD.
1,Judy! Judy! Judy!,"NO two-hour ""Judy Garland: By Myself"" PBS documentary = NO purchase of the ""Easter Parade"" Blu-ray! Somehow, we need to teach the WB corporate vampires a lesson we mean business when it comes to falsifying the cover art that a documentary is included with our purchase of ""Easter Parade"" when there is NO documentary included!"
4,Almost perfect,"I am so happy to see Warner is FINALLY moving away from their inferior digipacks and using the industry standard Amaray cases, as they did with this one and The Band Wagon. This is an excellent set with a crisp, clean picture and good extras. However, I am a bit annoyed that the studios release anything with ""Special Edition"" on it and then not put 5.1 surround sound on it -- this one is in Mono! Universal is guilty of doing the same thing on some of their SE's. Oh well, it is far better than VHS. Of course, there is no much to say about this movie that hasn't already been said. What an excellent show to watch when spring is upon us!"
5,Wonderful Movie!!!,I fell in love with this movie the very first time I watched it. Definitely a must have if you love classic movies.
5,WONDERFUL MOVIE!!!,I just love the movie. I'm a big fan of Judy Garland and I love all her movies and this one is just wonderful...I hope many people watched and enjoy it the way I did...
5,Wonderful book!,"My son (2 years old) absolutely adores this book! We typically read a minimum of three books together every evening, and this, is always one of them! (The other constant is another Don and Audrey Wood book - The mouse, the red ripe strawberry and the big hungry bear). The ""quick as a cricket"", ""slow as a snail"" similies through the book are wonderful. I would highly recommend it!"
5,Quick as a Cricket,"Cute book! There are puppets that can be purchased to go along with the story, they are great for kids to keep them engaged and involoved."
1,Quick As A Cricket,I purchased four copies of Quick As A Cricket at around $10.00 a copy last fall to give as gifts over the course of the year. One of the copies I gave as a gift is seriously flawed. I was embarrassed. Inside the book there are pages that were omitted and multiple pages of the same pictures in their place. I have been hesitant to purchase books since this incident.
5,review for: Quick as a Cricket,I love this book!It has beautiful pictures that are fun & intresting & lets kids know that everyone/thing has their own traits & qualities. Being different is what makes you special.BOTTOM LINE: This is a must have for all parents of young children.
5,Excellent toddler book!,One of my favorite children's books ever. Love the illustrations! Read it over and over to my 27 yr old son. Purchased as a baby shower gift
3,Too many glitches,"The performances are very good and the sound quality is good, but there are many digital sounding glitches similar to a poor MP3. It is sad that such a great band is marred by such sloppy mastering. A fan will want this, but a perfectionist might be a bit annoyed. They tour often, and there is no reason for a CD to be released that is imperfect like this. Again, a great performance that is worth checking out, but just be ready for some distortions that get in the way of the performance."
1,The Return of the Voice?,"I am a life long Bunnymen fan, since I first heard 'Rescue' seep through a neighbour's wall in London in 1980. They are my favourite Liverpool combo bar none. The songs and albums and great gigs stay with me forever. New York 1982. London 1984. Dublin 1986. London comeback 1996. Brussels 2001.Today I bought this album. It was recorded in London in late 2005 at Shepherds Bush. The track listing is great, all my favourites, and I could not wait to get home to hear it. It takes a while to get going and for the first seven songs 'the voice' sound very thin and wasted but the band are great throughout and by the middle of the set things start to catch fire and 'Mac' return to us. A triumph of mind over matter? Cant help wondering if he laid off the ciggies for a while we would have a classic Bunnymen set once again."
4,Agneta Nilsson,"This is one of the finest examples of Synthesizer Music I've ever heard. A combination of Vangelis and Tangerine Dream styles and yet, at the same time, has a distinct style of it's own. The opening track, ""Perspective I"", itself is the mainstay, I feel. If ever there was a Cybernetic Anthem, this is it! ""Perspective II"" is getting back to the original idea of Electronic Music. Short but pure Electronic Music. The next two tracks seem to stray a little I think, but interesting all the same. The final track is almost a review of all the pieces previous to it, although I can't help feeling it loses it's way a little. If the whole album was like the first two tracks it would be magnificent, but in this instance I can say it's only really good."
3,"Dylan's poetry, Cabot's delivery","I first heard this album in the 60's, so it takes me back every time I listen to it. It's fun to either concentrate on meaning or to sit back and just go with the flow of the delivery."
1,Why and what's the reason for?,"British actor Sebastian Cabot was best known for playing the butler, ""Mr. French"", on the sitcomFamily Affair. On this album, Cabot ""acts out"" the lyrics to songs by Bob Dylan. It's as ridiculous as it sounds. Cabot affects different accents to play various ""characters"" in the songs, and manages to overact in every instance. It's very bad, but ""so bad it's good"". Very entertaining for fans of bad music."
3,For the Ultimate Collector,"OK....so the album is a little hokey. However I ended up buying the original vinyl and now I have it on CD. Sebastian Cabot had a wonderful voice and his interpretation of Dylan is to say the least ""interesting.""This is definitely one for a fanatic collector."
2,"A song or two, okay,,,,,,,,,,a dozen,,,,,,,torturous.","I heard SC's version of LIKE A ROLLING STONE, and was really intrigued.I bought the disc,,,,,,,,,,,,,It's just tooooooo, tooooooooo, much.Like the title says, a dozen songs, is about 10 too many.For the Dylan Completist only."
1,worthless book,"I bought this book at my local auto parts store when I had to replace a blower motor and the blower motor switch. This book was so off the mark in reference to taking the dashboard apart to access the blower motor switch (it did not tell you that you had to loosen the under panel under the steering wheel in addition to the instrument bezel cluster) and so off the mark in reference to the blower motor (there were five screws instead of three screws and the manual did not tell you that the stud that the coolant resevoir mounted to gets in the way of removing the blower motor. You literally have to remove the stud to get the blower motor out of the truck)A pathetic excuse for a manual. Next time, I will buy a Chiltons"
5,Cool frame,Exactly what my husband wanted and as described. It goes very well with the rest of his skull theme on his truck.
5,great techniques head to toe/ very thorough/ easy to follow,"this product can help you give massages like a professional or sometimes even better. it covers head, neck, shoulder,back, legs,& hands, fingers- everything. ive bought/borrowed several videos on massage & this is the best one."
2,Disappointed,"I was hoping to have a video walk me through performing a basic massage. This video provided very little verbal instruction. It would be helpful if the massage specific terminology used was defined or described. The verbal instruction ofetn did not relate to the masssge technique being shown. Often the camera angle was blocked by the person performing the massage so you could not see how to do the massage. They did provide overhead camera angles which would have been ideal for the entire video, but rarely used it. So the quality of the production leaves a lot to be desire, I needed a massage after viewing this video."
5,A Big Wow For This Heartfelt Journey To Find Home,"I hoped MULTICOLORED MEMORIES OF A BLACK SOUTHERN GIRL would continue past its 173 pages. I just finished the book, and I want more. Kitty Oliver's journey from a small Florida town to her travels around the world feel very real. ""When a trip is over for me, however, I enjoy observing the way life falls back into place. The toothbrush slides into the cup waiting empty on the sink.""Kitty's honest account of her childhood, her family, her personal encounters with integration and her journey to find ""home"" resonate with each description and heartfelt memory. I'm a fan of her writing and look forward to more, soon!"
4,It's Senor Coconut!,"Good brand new music from Senor Coconut. Fourteen tracks, all instrumentals, with a few samples of vocals. Kind of mellow, almost easy listening, with the Latin beat. All sampled and synthesized. Very enjoyable!"
1,Avoid at all costs!,"I too have guilt about having fed this to my dogs for so long. My dogs had been gassy (almost perpetually, it seemed), and I wrote it off to just something dogs did. Then, one of my dogs (I have 2 beagles) became sick (unrelated to the food) and we had to switch foods, and wound up just going and switching for both. It didn't dawn on me until a few weeks later that my dogs were no longer gassy (and we all breathe much easier!). I doubt very seriously that this is coincidence since they both had the problem and now they don't.My advice is to avoid this stuff like the plague!"
4,Heldon - 'Interface' (Cuneiform),"Originally released in 1976, looks to be Heldon's fourth effort. It's been noted that 'Interface' shows off the true intellectual musicianship of Richsrd Pinhas. Have to pretty much agree with that. Liked the ten-minute ""Jet Girl"" as well as the intricate ""Bal-A-Fou"". Also was impressed with the CD reissue's last three tracks - ""Interface, Part 1"", ""Interface, Part 2"" and the nineteen-minute complex title cut ""Interface"". Line-up: Pinhas-synthesizer, guitar & moog, Patrick Gauthier-keyboards, Didier Batard-bass and Francois Auger-synthesizer & drums. A should-have."
2,Not!!,This product was and is too harsh on my stomach. As soon as I take it I had to go to the restroom. Not good when you take it before you go to the gym.
3,It's ok. (flavor-wise),"Based solely off of taste, this is the worst protein I've tried from Dymatize Elite. It's better mixed with other things, so if you're planning on mixing this with other ingredients anyways, then you'll love it. Plain, though, a bit on the bland side."
5,IT'S MY BREAKFAST AND DINNER,Taste alot better than the rest and comes in handy for those who live on the go.
4,An introduction to scrap quilting,"This book introduces scrap quilts to someone who is not sure yet about scrap quilting. It includes some nice basic patterns with each quilt shown in a color plate. There is some adivce on how to decide on a color scheme for your quilt. Another section shows different layout possiblities for some of the patterns in the book.Not a faboulos book, but a solide one."
3,Underrated Movie- Did anyone even watch WATERWORLD...Its not that bad,"I admit the movie has some flaws and its still a descent film. Not one of my favourites but I was entertained nonetheless. If someone today said mentions WATERWORLD, they just say ""urh thats a terrible movie"". The chances are they probably haven't even seen the movie. People just follow everyone elses opinion because they want to be with the crowd. I am not a Costner fan. He does not fit the bill well for our fish-man lead. Mostly because there wasn't much development in characters. Ok the bit when Costner drinks his own pee was just awful. Its not the first thing you want to see when you enter a movie. The world flooded is quite impossible but theres your story. What pissed me off was it was too much like ""Roadwarrior"". If you can forget about that you might think the movie is okay. The special effects were great. It was nice to see a movie without any CGI. This was not one of the most expensive movies for nothing."
5,"""Gentlemanlike Guppy""","Waterworld is a great film, but you won't understand it unless you see it several times. Kevin Costner stars as Mariner, who is despised for his amphibious mutation. Cruel treatment by humans his has made him bitter and he wonders if there are others like him in the world. Dennis Hopper plays the leader and false prophet of the ""Smokers"", who is searching for him and a map showing an area with dry land. At the end, Mariner finds his own version of humanity and continues his search."
2,Visually Stimulating...and not much else,"This movie dazzles you with visual effects, but the adventure, action, and plot moved too slowly. I like the Waterworld attraction at Universal Studios Hollywood, though. That's how the movie should have been made."
4,DTS IS REALLY WORTH THE WAIT!!!,"I am a Home Theater buff who has waited and waited for something to be released on DTS DVD, finally Waterworld arrives and let me tell you, it was worth the wait! This movie presented in all its DTS glory sounds incredible not to say the video is superb also. Watch the first ten minutes of this DVD in Dolby Digital, then start it over and watch it in DTS and you will be blown away, I absolutely loved it. My fronts,center,surrounds, and subwoofer came to life with such clarity, which is one word that explains DTS, that once you hear what DTS is capable of you will be looking to buy your next DVD with DTS sound. This is a great movie to give you a taste of what DTS is all about. I highly recommend this to all of you with DTS capable systems. Don't have one? Get one! You won't regret it."
3,cut version,When I originally saw this in the theatre there were extra scenes shown. But the video versions were edited and the movie shortened. You get scene cuts in the movie and you realize that something extra was supposed to be there. If you want to see the full version they show on the sci-fi channel every so often.
4,Entertaining with older kids,"My husband and I watched this with our son who is in high school. Definitely not a great movie, but it was entertaining for all of us without being too inappropriate (these are sometimes hard for us to find)."
1,Doesn't load,This is the first HDD DV that I've ordered and it doesn't work in any of the 4 DVD players that I have. The website for upgrading the DVD players software is no longer available and I'm at a loss as to whether it's the DVD or the players. It's more of a bother to send the DVD back than to just chuck it.
1,I'd rather watch paint dry!,"The year was 1995. I was only nine years old and even as a nine year old, I knew how stupid and senseless this movie's plot was. The idea that the continents could be drowned by the oceans is incorrect and wildly exagerated. Even if all the ice on earth melted like it did in the movie, it would only raise sea level by a few feet or so. To suggest that even the highest mountains, several miles higher than the oceans, could be submerged by melting polar ice is just absurd! Thats like saying that the ice cubes in your freezer are going to flood your entire house if you turn the heat up too high! I can't reccommend Waterworld to anybody. Global warming is nothing more than a whacko doomsday theory, and a story about it does not make a movie entertaining--it just causes stupifying boredom! Even watching paint dry is more fun than watching Waterworld!"
2,Disappointed.,"Nowhere that I could find in the description of ""Waterworld"" did it say that there would be subtitles in Chinese. Very distracting when watching the film. and I cannot remove them. Unfortunately I did not retain the paper work as I would like to return this item and hope to find one without the Chinese subtitles. What do you suggest?Eileen"
4,I enjoyed it,"The little girl in the movie, well, she made the whole movie. This is a good story, something we don't think about. It has it moments, but overall, an enjoyable film."
3,Dissapointed,"I was very happy to find out Waterworld is coming out on blu-ray, that is until I saw that it will not include the extended version witch is almost a full 45 mins longer. I am going to wait and hope that the extended version is released on blu-ray in the near future."
1,Beware: HD DVD can ONLY be played on an HD player,"As the title states this DVD can only be played on a special player. Therefore, it was useless to me. My fault. I didn't realize that when I bought it. I thought it was like watching HD television, if you don't have that service, it's just not as clear. I was wrong. An HD DVD REQUIRES and HD player.I LOVE this movie which is why I was looking for a copy for my library."
1,SO BAD!,This is maybe the worst film ever! TERRIBLE! I have to talk about this with my psychiatry....AWFUL! I would like more to commit suicide than watch this movie again!
1,This could of been a great transfer to Blu Ray but...,"This could of been a great transfer to Blu Ray but... This movie sucks period. I'm really surprized this was even on the blu ray burners when theres so much better movies waiting for blu ray. Never understood why companies give crap old and new movies for the first few years of new formats. DvD did same in the years before PS2.""Save your money on this one and invest in a gun and bulet."""
1,The world will never flood!,The very concept of global warming is so stupid. Has it ever occured to anybody that the oceans contain 97% of all water on Earth? Only 3% of this planet's water isn't already in the oceans! There's simply not enough water in the world to drown the continents.
1,Hollywood: Take Science Classes For God's Sake!,"Did no one do any homework before this turkey was OK'd? IF there were enough water to cover all the land masses on earth, the first place to find land would be Mt. Everest! Being that Mt. Everest is over 29,000 feet high, earth would#1: Be a perfect iceball. Better to name this movie Ski World.#2: No one could breathe at 29,000', so all of mankind is either dead from altitude or frozen like popsicles.Can't Kevin Costner find another plot? Always bad guys come in, take over a territory (Postman, Dances With Wolves, Open Range, Waterworld.) Does no one own a comb or take a bath?Terrible movie, so many good scripts out there languishing that will never see the light of day! But this crap does!"
4,Still waiting for the sequel,"This movie made me a Kevin Costner fan. I watched it ten times in ten days. Action from beginning to end. Funny at times, you can't help but like the bad guy (Dennis Hopper). The little girl did a great acting job. It took you away to a different time. Don't listen to the critics it's a good science FICTION adventure, I thought well worth the money. Bittersweet ending, I know they did that on purpose to make a Waterworld Two, I am still waiting? Anyone knowing where I can buy the full version please e-mail me."
3,An sci-fi action movie that takes place in the future!,Kevin Costner stars in this sci-fi action movie in the future where the earth is covered by water! This movie is action packed and still fun despite the critics bashing it! To think this movie at the time was budget as much as Titanic(and we know what happened with that movie! ) This movie should be for fans of Dennis Hopper and Kevin Cosnter! The only problem I have with the movie is too much water gets me seasick! Plus were are the delated parts that were on the tv broadcast of this movie!maybe it's time the studio reissues this movie with all the missing parts from the tv broadcast!
1,Someone Likes this film?,"I cannot believe that there are positive reviews for one of Kevin Costner's worst films. Predictable plot full of stereotypes and bad links to current affairs - villans are called ""Smokers"" and ride around in the Exxon Valdez. People with cigarettes in an oil tanker? In the end a dribble that cannot even compare to Mad Max films which were made on shoestring budget for the most part. Even the weakest entry - the 3rd was better than this movie."
2,Where is the extended version,"I am like many of the other reviewers in thinking that when I purchased the Blu-ray disk I would be getting the extended version. I am getting tired of the studios putting out multiple versions just to make a buck. Just look at Watchmen (three versions before you could take a breath). Like several of my friends, I am simply going to wait a few months and see how long it takes for the good one to be released. If I need a movie fix I will rent one. Buy the way, despite everything else I like the movie. When you watch a movie, live it, enjoy it. Taking the time to find its faults is a waste of your time. If you have the time to do that, turn the movie off and walk away."
3,great movie,love the movie so had to have it but wish they would put out the uncut version .if they do i will buy it again
4,...water version of the Road Warrior...,i never understood why people didnt like this movie. its like the Road Warrior but with lots of water instead of dirt. Costner played the perfect character as the Mariner in this' movie and Hopper was a fun villian as the Deacon. plus no fake looking CGI and lots of action!...repeat viewings for me :)
1,Blu-Ray Review,"No Extended Cut, No Purchase. WTF is wrong with these Greedy Studios? Just like the Rest of America, all about Greed. It's sickening."
2,Um... Yeah,"In the scene where the little girl is in the water and Kevin Costner bungees down to get her, even if Costner had not retrieved the girl, the two water-jetting enemies would have crashed into each other anyway.I just wanted to point out this humerous fact, I'm sorry."
1,Product defective!-Junk,"Item was defective! Was not worth the time and effort to return, shipping and my time and gas would make it cheaper to buy another DVD from a brick and mortar store. Amazon usually has good stuff, but if they keep this kind of practice up, they will go the way of Circuit City."
1,DANCES WITH(out) BRAIN (part one),Wash down this s**t down the toilet together with people who made this expensive insult to the post-apocalyptic films. What evil forces sponsored this trash which polute our minds and oceans ?
2,No Extended Version!?,"I'm a big fan of this movie.I had preordered it and thought it included the Extended version. I would have rather owned the versionthat adds 40 minutes and makes a more enjoyable movie experience.I was dissapointed to find out it was the original theatrical version only.If I had known that, I wouldn't have purchased it. It's great have Waterworld on Bluray, it looks amazing,but I would have rather waited for the extended version that I'm sure will come out eventually. The movie companies always have to find a way to make an extra buck at our expense by making us by the same movie twice."
3,EXTENDED EDITION IS ABC CUT!!,"A few years after Waterworld was released on video ABC aired an extended cut on public television. I have been waiting for a long time for the extended edition to be released and now it finally has been. While watching it I relied something that shocked me that is the ABC version, the cussing is gone, the violence is soften and some scenes have been cut out, and no Helen bare back shot. Even some of the sound effects and music has been changed. After doing more research I found this to be true. Instead of revising a 'true' extended edition Universal just put the ABC version on here (without commercials of course) and just added a 5.1 soundtrack to it. What a waste of money this was/is. I guess that's why it is only 15 bucks, I would have gladly spent 50 bucks for an unedited extended cut."
4,Timeless adventure classic!,Great adventure flick with some mad max attitude!HD-DVD is great in picture quality but don't expect to much on the extras.
3,They should release the extended version,"I first saw this movie as a rental of the theatrical version. It was okay. But I liked it much better when I saw the extended version on broadcast tv. About 45 minutes of footage is added to the extended version, which actually helps the movie a great deal in my opinion. While the extended version is shown on sci-fi channel from time to time (in a four hour time slot), it is not available on video. Nor is the additional footage contained on the DVD release - to my knowledge. So they should release the extended version on DVD, which would be worth buying."
4,Apocalypse Wow!,"Kevin Reynold's is obviously a student of Coppola's work. KR's films (The Beast, Rapa Nui, Waterworld) are all reminiscent in one way or another of Coppola's Vietnam War epic. Yet, WW is original. The idea of setting the action almost entirely at sea is a previously unused concept. Jeanne Tripplehorn is excellent in her role as the lonely damsel-in-distress type. Deniis Hopper's performance is forgettable, except for its Apocalypse Now reference, once again. But, the picture has utterly spectacular stunt scenes, the watery horizon helping out there. Too bad the film got so much bad pre-release press its box-office days were numbered the day it premiered. Because of the film's failure, Hollywood's going to wait a long time before it invests another Fort Knox budget into an epic film that's purely action . . . ((sigh))."
5,From disappointed to fascinated...,"When I first watched the movie I thought - what's this?? I was utterly disappointed! Then I watched it again, nice... and a third time - WOW. It's true, it is absolutley underrated and according to my own experience becomes better and better each time you watch it. One customer wrote: Buy the DTS version. I can only agree: It is really worth it. I think that Kevin Costner pays special attention of how his movies appear in public. The movie has NO extras (subtitles, making of, etc.) but picture and sound quality is one of the best. The story has action, suspense and humor and gives you the good feeling of being entertained very well. Get it for your collection - the DTS one - it's worth it."
4,Movie classic,"I am a big Kevin Costner fan and like him in most things, so good movie that will be watched often in our household."
4,We're safe behind this wall,"Waterworld DVDWaterworld is a fantasy movie about all the polar ice caps melting and flooding the entire globe( right, fill a glass with ice cubes, fill it up to the brim with water, wait until all the ice has melted and the water level rises up until the water spills out of the glass.) Hint- don't hold your breath.Anyhow the bad guys are ""SMOKERS"" and their base is an oil tanker. You guessed itSPOILER ALERTThe Exxon ValdezRecommended for people who believe the Hollywood fantasies being put out.This just in:THE POLAR ICECAPS ARE MELTING.OM MARS!Gunner December, 2007"
2,half and half,Out the two disc only 1 was in good condition . The extended cut played fine but original cut disc 1 was scratch and damage but I did get it for the extended cut so I kept it.
3,somebody goofed editing this one,"Ya I admit it, I love trailers, and I get really [mad] when someone puts movie clips in the trailer that is not in the movie. Jeanne Tripplehorn belly-acking to the elders about dry land in the trailer and not in the movie. Vary bad move.Maybe someone should mention to the editers, when you put mention of a music box in the the mid part of the movie you should put one in befor not at the end.Perhaps it would have done better at the box office if more of the movie was left in or do we get to look forword to a remix of this when someone needs a little extra fair publisity."
4,A BOMB? Or Explosive?,"Waterworld is very much like Mad Max: The Road Warrior on water. Is that bad? I don't think so, since I like both movies. Yet Waterworld has some beautiful cinematography that gets easily overlooked by those who think this movie wasn't worth their time. What do I like about it? The setting, music, and even the story. Costner's independent and tough character actually carries a level of humor and charm.I think the greatest visual disappointment was when the underwater city was shown; very bad CGI/background effects; I think I'd rather leave that scene to my imagination. At any rate, eveything else was a roller-coaster of fun and adventure.The DVD has NO special features (I think the non-DTS has a promo), so don't expect beautiful menus, but all-in-all it's a great film, give it a chance."
4,A picture of our future?,"At last! 10 years I was looking for this 135 min release!I missed the TV show, my VCR did not work, and the bootleg VHS was too bad to watch... I was finally thinking this movie was doomed not only for ""Mr. Cost-ner"".Today I can say it is a good action sci-fie movie with memorables scenes and sentences (Denis Hopper whith his fake eye talking to the Mariner attacking the Exxon Valdez: ""Golly gee! A single tear rolls down my cheek."").It is an interesting picture of what some people want us to believe: Ice-melting in the North-Pole will cause oceans covering every flat land. Are you sure?When ice-cubes melt in my glass the coktail is not overflowing...Please live happy!"
3,its a nice movie,"I cannt believe they were a lot of negative things about that movies, yes it was very expensive but its a nice futuristic thrillerIts has actions and funny things"
1,Waterworld - DVD wrong format,We cannot view this DVD because it is not in universal region code and in australia we are on Universal or Pal.

You cats don't waana come thru New Jerusalem or Brick City, stay yo punk asses in Cali!This album's aight not as tight as his first album in 93!"
5,A great book to learn about hamsters!,"This book is great! I teach third grade and bought this book for my classroom library when we got our first hamster. When we got another species, I couldn't find the book! It's always in someone's desk so they can read it next!!There are a lot of pictures and it's laid out in a simple manner. It's not confusing to read and laid out in a manner that I learned a lot and my third graders are learning a lot. It is great for children because it doesn't go too in depth on mating issues...it explains basics without graphic detail like I've seen in other books.The best section is on the hamster life cycle! I got two Dwarfs who happened to be male and female (unknown to me!) They've already had too litters and the kids are learning now about the hamster life cycle. This book has been invaluable for that. The kids are able to view pictures of the newborn babies without having to disturb mom."

4,Excellent and Informative for my first Marketing class,"Marketing: Connecting with Customers has been an excellent and informative book for my first college Marketing class. I have been debating whether or not to major in Business Marketing. This book has helped me to think I would like to be apart of our Marketing department. I like that this book is fairly new and updated. The charts, lists, and especially the Internet links are easy to read and very convenient. I have been able to go to the Internet sites and learn extra information that my teacher would not be able to spend time on. My mom is the Dean of Business at a college; so I have been able to suggest this book and varies sites that may help her and her department. I really like the Connecting with Diversity and Case Studies sections. It is always beneficial to understand the information in a real life situation. Hope you enjoy Marketing: Connecting with Customers also."
4,nice focus on quality and satisfaction!,"Finally ... a principles of marketing textbook organized around quality and customer satisfaction! In addition to a chapter dealing with these topics, both are woven through the remainder of the text as well. Lots of excellent contemporary examples, including many web URLs. One fault: lack of strategic integration in any meaningful way. But that's something that hopefully a professor can add to a principles class."
3,Harrell and Frazier...one and one-half thumbs up,"As a college student, I found this book to be one of the easier texts to follow. It gave illustrations for those of us who are visual learners and provided the literary information necessary to do somewhat well on tests...however, I think there was an excess of fluff (i.e. charts, diagrams, pictures, etc.) which only makes poor college students pay more for a textbook that will be out of date next year!"
4,This is a great book.,Marketing Connecting with customersby Gilbert Harrell and Gary Frazier is a very well. I have found that the chapter summaries at the end of each chapter is great for studying for tests. Each Chapter has interesting information and excellent illustrations. This book has helped make my college Marketing Class interesting and enjoyable to attend.
3,A Day Late and a Dollar Short,"Marketing: Connecting with Customers is a textbook that focuses on marketing products and services to customers by the most effective and efficient means possible. There are quite a few figures, charts, and examples that supplement the basic wording and teaching of the text. If studied properly difficult concepts can be grasped. This book was written for someone with no basic knowlege of marketing and marketing tactics to get them up and running in the marketing field. Over all it is a good book but the reading appears boring and easy to skip over without grasping all the concepts."
4,This book is applicable and useful in todays world.,"Marketing, Connecting with Customers is a very useful book. The information and topics expressed in the reading are easy to read and enjoyable for a text book. I have taken other business clases and the books are full of pig latin. This book however is understandible and clear. I feel that this book would be a valuable resource to anyone in a marketing class."
2,Marketing: Connecting with Customers,"The graphs and charts that the authors used in the book were of fairly good quality, but the charts were postioned poorly. I do not wish to keep this book a the end of the semester I will trade it back for part of my money back. The changes that I would make on this book is that the authors need to put the figures in where the figure is introduced in the text, some are on totally different pages at times. For example on page 350 the book says, ""in figure 12-4 indicates..."" the figure is actually located on page 352. The authors introduce so much information in one chapter and then in the next have very little. The author also have a dendecy to repeat the same stuff over and over again to make ready very boring. Over all I really did not like the book, and reinforced my decision not to go into Marketing as a career. One useful feature the book had is that it came with a cdrom that was not to bad, just that we did not use it in class."
4,Pum Pum Gone Wild,if you like a lot of booties with raggae beats this is the master piece of street parties!
3,Uneven performances,"It is a delight to listen to the Lizst transcriptions of the Beethoven Symhonies, however the symhonies lend themselves to dual piano performers rather than a single piano as featured in this album. Many of the transcriptions in this set are quite nicely performed, particularly the first 6 symphonies, with the exception of the Eroica which is not well played. The 7th and 8th are OK and the 9th is, what can I say, perhaps the greatest piece of music ever composed, but less than a satisfying performance in this album, particularly the 4th movement. All in all, worth it's moderate pricing, but don't buy it if you're looking for Beethoven masterpiece recordings. If you are very familiar with the symhonies and want to hear someting unusual, then this is a good addition to your collection.-"
2,VHS?,I assumed this was a DVD and was shocked that there are still VHS tapes floating around out there or VHS players for that matter. The product description did not clearly indicate that this was a VHS tape. Great video though. Something all soccer organizations should consider.
4,"Good deal, but...the dimensions are incorrect...","[TO AMAZON: THE PRODUCT DIMENSIONS FOR THIS ITEM ARE INCORRECTLY LISTED.]A1260C/and HAPF60 are both shown as being 11.2 X 6.6 X 1.8I just received a sealed bulk 4-pack of these carbon replacement filters. They are actually 9.25 X 6 X 1/8 and are not the size I was actually looking for. However they are of good quality, and after cutting them to size I actually ended up with 12 ""custom"" replacement filters of the dimensions I needed.Nov 1, 2011NOTE: I probably should have mentioned that I purchased these to create a carbon pre-filter for my Honeywell TrueAir Purifier, and was simply looking for a certain size...I wanted to keep my HEPA filter cleaner for a longer time, as well as boosting the overall air filtration. These work beautifully for that purpose! The carbon filter goes right in front of my HEPA filter without affecting the intake cowling, making this a very inexpensive upgrade for the excellent Honeywell product."
1,Don't waist your money,I have tried these and they don't do any good except filter the bigger stuff like hair and some dust. What I did was go to Home Depot and buy the WEB Electrostatic filters which comes in a big sheet and cut it to size covering the inside of the door opening. These filters the smoke and other odors and saves the inner filters from being replaced so often saving money.
3,This is an Analysis of Art of War not Art of War,"So... Just so you know. Remember, anyone can review any product on Amazon, and for the most part few actually review the product itself. This particular eBook is thick with in-depth information on Art of War and its author. It takes about 3 chapters to even begin to reach the chapter. First a discussion of Sun Tsu's existence, then of the books existence, then of the 13 critics that will be interjected as you read the book. And the interjections don't wait till the end or are footnoted, they're put wherever and however long need be.It's not bad, in fact, it's really informative; but I just wanted the 13 chapters. If you think you'd be apply to just push through the square bracket passages be ready for a real challenge. I'd want to rate it 1 to offset the other ratings but this 'edition' isn't that bad, just not what was expected."
1,Extremely Disappointed - Falsely Advertised,"When I search for ""Art of War"" using Amazon's search engine, the first book on the results list should NOT be an extremely short, cliff's notes version of the book. When I purchased this, I was under the impression it would be the full length book. This is a case of false representation, and I do not recommend this book to anyone. I would rate this book (and my overall experience) with 0 stars if that was an option."
1,A confusing publication that would benfit from understanding the book itself,"It is horrid. It isn't the book on The Art of War, it is a publication of the cliff notes."
1,A Horrible Format for a Great Book,"The actual book by Sun Tzu is amazing. I imagine all the high star ratings for this come from people who didn't read this version, because this translation is written by somebody who thinks he's arrogant enough to have his comments interrupt the middle of the actual text. It becomes confusing, and more importantly, it becomes unreadable. I did however find out how to delete things off my Kindle and my account because this was so bad. So, please do yourself a favor and avoid this copy of the book."
2,Not What I Expected,I was hoping for something that was more readable and understandable. I thought that this book provided strategies in short form but it does not.
3,Ugh,"This is a pretty brutal read. There may be really good parts to this but as far as reading this from front to back, good luck with that!"
3,too much commentary,The person rewriting this classic piece of work adds in too much of his own commentary. It makes for difficult reading in regards to when sunzi is instructing and when this rewriter is commenting. It was like reading 2books.
3,Words only a warrior could love,"Much to much background. A lot of ""he said, she said"" by the author that overwhelms Sunzi. Many people have mentioned his sayings yet one has to pick through the bale of hay to find those needles of wisdom so delicately placed."
4,A fine edition of a fine text,"Sun Tzu's treatise is treated tremendously in this translation. Most folks are aware of the importance of this work, and Clavell's version adds to its importance by improving its readability."
4,For class,"The Art of War is a good book that applies to all aspects of life. Once you get over the layout of the book it is an easy read, and has some grate insights. It was nice to get some history and practical examples to see how the strategies worked out in ancient warfare."
2,Overrated,"This is a silly little book. I suspect that it is popular because of the Michael Douglas character in that movie...""Wall Street""?There are some clever little sayings of advice. I would not base a whole strategy, be it war or business or life, on it though.""No town should be attacked which, if taken, cannot be held, or if left alone, will not cause any trouble."" (page 37)Brilliant."
1,why is this not avaliable in the asia pacific region!???,"why is this not avaliable in the asia pacific region!???I mean come on, its hundreds of years old and in the public domain, why cant i get the kindle edition?"
4,Practical,This book was easy to read with the notations and references. It is also practical for everyday use in getting ahead in your career ; especially in corporate America. Just use your imagination!
4,"""The Art of War"", a 3000 year old ""How to Make War"" classic","Wow! This is not only about war, but you can apply this to almost any endeavor and learn how to win consistently. It teaches you that winning is mostly about preparation, planning, teamwork, and above all, knowing both yourself and your opponent. It does not just say these things, it also tells you the how and the why, with examples. Be aware this is a translation from ancient Chinese, so the translator has inserted notes about the difficulty of translating the true meaning of certain passages. However, in all he does a great job. This is the book that ALL great generals have read. Charge on!"
3,not sure,Seems like many peoople complained about the translation and the format of the book. I am not sure if I should get it. Is there another version with better translation?
4,The Art of War,I realized it is written like a campfire scout group meeting where the focus is on the Master but in using these words of a philisophical ideology you can use it far beyond the initial meanings and thoughts. This is such a wide spread useful tool many people trying to find ways of handling themselves can get value from this book!
2,"Translation and history, more than the book",Translator seems to be writing his own book about the famous book. Very hard to follow as it is became a very boring history book about a book.
2,Muddled,"The introduction is the best part of this book. I think that's the closest you can get to a biography of Sunzi, so that's good. But the book itself is very confusingly formatted. The organization is completely unclear; it does not read like a text so much as a list. There are so many additions and footnotes that it is not clear where Sunzi ends and where Cleary begins."
2,bought e-edition,"The book is a short version of the actual one, but it seems to jump around too much and lacks a description of whats going on."
1,NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECT! I DIDN'T LIKE IT!,Very hard read that was writin awful. Wish i would have saved my money. Dont make the same mistake i did.
3,Good book but the practice is a bit silly...,"The invention of the atom bomb and many other new technologies have pretty much had an impact on the philosophy of this book but it is still a good read. A few things do stand out though, like others have mentioned. How good are the Chinese at fighting war? Japan certainly slapped them around. Most of that was the result of biological warfare and the development of medical practices during war times.Read the book for the philosophy which is pretty good but I certainly would not count on this to get you out of trouble in a dark alley at night. I would also not count on it to help you win a war."
1,Ok but not relevant!,I guess all in all it was alright but I can't see any use for the information. It took me several days to read because I just couldn't get into it. I liked Shogun much better.
5,Human Nature,"The reason this book is a timeless classic is because it analyzes all aspects of war from the standpoint of human nature, and makes a solid case that any endeavor that fails to take into account human nature is doomed to failure. Because the subject is warfare, including its causes, and the analysis is solid, one is left with not only the first order result (how to handle a war situation effectively) but also a life changing understanding of the humbling constraints of human existence and the pragmatics of applied psychology. Anyone who is bored by this book (and this particular one is excellent) is not yet ready to learn basic lessons about human existence. Anyone who is capable of humility will be changed by this book. It should be read by everyone, several times throughout life."
1,poor layout - poorly edited,"Fortunately, I only tried the sample on my Kindle. Would have been a 100% loss since the text seems to be hardly edited and incomplete.The layout on the Kindle is terrible.Dont't buy this. Shame on Amazon for trying to sell such a flawed product!I'd rather go for a free and complete edition by Project Gutenberg. Or look for a different edition."
5,One of the greatest,"A must read for anyone interested in politics/business/philosophy or just life in general. This has a lot of meaning to those who read it properly, though understanding all of it may take time."
2,Great book. Awful version,"I don't know why did I buy this instead of geting a free, better version. Don't make the same mistake."
1,Not for me,"Although this is an acclaimed book, popular apparently in business schools andelsewhere, I found it utterly unreadable.Not for me."
5,Bringing love to the garden,What Murray does with her poetic text and beautiful photos is show us how love and commitment to life shape gardens! I have had the book many years and frequently refer back to it for its wisdom and beauty.
4,"What's next, a cosmic omelette?","I thought from the title that this book told the story of my less than illustrious birth, but silly me, it's actually a philosophy book. By way of perhaps egging you on to crack this book, I would say it's actually a pretty decent one, and the author discusses the ideas of writers as diverse as Teilhard de Chardin, Paul Tillich, C.G. Jung, Jesus, Carlos Castaneda, and Jean Piaget to show how we may envision a different existence for ourselves and a different future for the human race."
3,It's made of particle-board,"I just got off the phone with Visiondecor. I thought I'd do some snooping before I purchased this. I'm glad I did. It turns out the this desk is actually made of particle-board, and _not_ solid wood.It's more expensive than the Target desk of the same designed. The Target desk _is_ made of solid wood."
3,came damaged,"Size is perfect, however the quality is not. It arrived with a corner bashed in the top corner. It is very heavy. Sending it back for a replacement will happen, but very difficult to accomplish due to weight."
4,SUPERMAN THE ANIMATED SERIES,"I would still rank Batman as a better animated series as it truly embraced the essence of the Dark Knight however Superman is not without his merits, this series manages to introduce a lot of characters and paves the way for Justice League.My favorite episodes was Mxyzpixilated I enjoy the lighthearted yet power this character brings to the Man of Steel.I would recommend this for younger viewing although Superman will always be a timeless hero for all ages."
5,LOVE THE WHOLE SERIES,IF YOU LOVE SUPERMAN THEN YOU WILL LOVE THIS WHOLE SERIES. I HAD TO HAVE THIS WHOLE COLLECTION BECAUSE I GOT THE WHOLE COLLECTION OF THE JUSTICE LEAGUE & JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED & I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT IN THOSE EPISODES SO NOW A LOT IS EXPLAINED BY WATCHING THE SUPERMAN SERIES. LOVE THEM ALL
3,Volume 3 Doesn't Have English Subtitles!,"Can someone explain to me why Volumes 1&2 have English subtitles, but Volume 3 doesn't? I'm hard of hearing so therefore I missed most of the dialogue. I would have rated Volume 3 higher if there were English subtitles. The Closed Caption feature is not coming through....TV, DVD Player or Disc problems? HDMI connected."
4,TURTLE POWER !!!!!!!,MY SON LOVED HIS BACKPACK AND I LOVED THE PRICE! THE BACKPACK IS BIG AND ALSO COMES WITH A WATER BOTTLE. MY SON WILL BE USING TO TRANSPORT HIS STUFFED DOGS AND TOYS FOR HE IS ONLY 2!
4,Envy.,"It's Brother Bear's birthday and he's gotten all sorts of cool presents. Sister Bear is unaffected by Brother's good fortune. Until Mama and Papa bring out their gift: a brand new green bicycle. Sister turns green in a fit of envy. Mama talks to her about being careful around the ""green-eyed monster"", but Sister doesn't seem to listen.This story isn't as interesting as some of the Berenstain Bears books. I think part of the reason is that the plot takes place in a 24-hour period. However, the book has a great message and kids love looking at the ugly green bike that causes all the problems."
2,Disappointing,"Pros: The size is great, the shape is good, the timer and warmer functions are a good idea, but...Cons: The outside gets too hot, the timer function limits you to 2 or 4 hours (high) and 6 or 8 hours (low) with nothing in between. Worst of all, the lid doesn't fit snugly enough to keep in the heat, resulting in uneven cooking.I returned the unit to where I bought it. While there, I noticed another Rival unit without the timer, a little bigger, shaped about the same, and... (here's the pertinent point) using the same lid. The lid fits that unit nice and snugly. Looks to me like they just didn't want to take the trouble to manufacture two different lids. Dumb."
1,customer service- whatta JOKE!,"my rival went out after 3 uses!!! Their customer service stinks! they wanted me to send the whole unit back PLUS (money). I didn't take their offer. Needless to say, I DID NOT BUY A RIVAL!"
2,Don't Buy It!,"I have had a crockpot for many years and loved it but I wanted a larger one. I got this one as a gift and hate it. It gets too hot inside and outside. I only used mine 3 times and each time I used it, it cooked my food quicker and quicker. By the 3rd time it cooked my food (that was supposed to take 8 hours on low) in about 1 1/2 hours!I called customer service and was told that I had to pay to send the bottom of the crockpot back and send along a check for $10.00 to cover the cost of sending it back to me! They said it would take one month. I did it and thankfully it only took 2 1/2 weeks. They sent me another WHOLE crockpot (in a damaged box). I just got it back yesterday so I am anxious to try it out and see if the same thing happens. Hopefully this one will work."
1,Piece of GARBAGE!,"This crock pot is awful. First of all, the ONLY thing it's going to heat is your kitchen. The outside gets so hot, it will burn your children's fingers, while your food remains cold.I even tried boiling some beans first and then putting them in the pot and setting it on high. The beans didn't come back up to boiling for hours. I finally gave up, and put them back on the stove. (And the beans were presoaked!)Not sure what makes this one so different from some of the other pots that seem similar and are rated pretty highly."
1,It's great if you like uncooked soup!,"I have had this crock pot for 2 years now and about twice a year I wonder why I don't use it, get it out and try to make soup with it. And what I find out every time is that this thing is a piece of garbage!!! I just tried to make pea soup with it and after 10 hours on high, yes 10 hours, it still wasn't close to being done. The outside gets hot enough to roast marshmallows, and the inside still had my split peas and carrots uncooked, swimming around in water. Save yourself and others from having to eat half cooked soup and don't buy this pot-o-crock!"
4,Complete Book of Drills for Winning Soccer,"This is a old book, some of the exercises aren't use nowadays because soccer training has suffer an evolution but despite that it's an useful book and you can use many drills to maximize your team performance."
5,The Explanation to a confused nation & religion,"Step by step, page by page, the actions of terrorism and hate forthe innocent is dis-spelled by this false religion by a false prophet (Muhammad). It is amazing to see that the distortion of the truth by Muhammad; to distort the mind of his people for the sheer convenience of his lifestyle as a petafile, and adulterer. I am glad that Dr. John Leo has expounded upon the truth of this religion from the common fact of History and Muhammad's destructive intent upon his people. This book explains the very nature of today's events in the middle east down to prophecy foretold."
5,Beautifully Illustrated,How very wonderful to find such a beautifully illustrated book that can reach into the heart of children. I highly recommend this book.
4,"Chic TV stand, good customer service by Walker Edison","Very pretty table that goes well with different decor. We had a missing part and when we called Walker Edison, they were very responsive and they immediately took care of the problem. It took my husband 40 minutes to assemble (and he is not very handy at times). Also, came with a cable management system which you have the option of using if you want to."
5,Amazing!,"Amazing. What else could I say? Inspired me to finally write a review. This book is laid out in easy to read chapters that focus on commonly believed ""healthy"" ideas; including fluoridation,soy, and green tea, with very well researched material thats cuts through the hype."
1,Don't be taken.,"These cameras/camcorders are of cheap quality. They fall apart quickly. (We got ours last night and this morning had trouble getting it to work.) The company does not supply the right drivers for the camera to work with Windows Xp and they are not available from the website. Filming in low lighting is a joke - all you see is a black screen. The zoom is only digital zoom, so if you zoom in closely, the pixels are huge. On the camera it says ""Effective 3.1 MP - MAXIMUM 12 MP"" Pretty much - you never get 12 mp quality (false advertising). If you want that kind of quality, go spend the 1500-2000 dollars that reliable retailers are asking. This looks and works like a child's toy."
1,RIPOFF!!!,Silicon Valley Peripherals is good at one thing only and that is complete and absolute deception. They sell the most inferior product on the market and charge $30.00 in shipping for what actual cost is $7.00.Please do yourself a favor before making a purchase with them and look up their ebay trade name clippercutie or Silicon Valley Peripherals with Ripoff Report or Google.You will be glad you did.Any good reviews for this company were most likely generated by the company itself.
1,Worst camera ever,"I made the mistake of not reading the reviews first. I purchased this cute camera in the hopes the 12MP would be remarkable. Problem is, the camera is only 5.1 MP, with a maximum of 12 MP! I took a few pictures using the tripod in excellent light and got the fuzziest, worst pictures ever. When I complained I was told this product is a camcorder, and only a digital camera secondary. What?! Why is it called a digital camera. Do yourself a favor and don't give this, whatever it is, a second thought."
2,Very Low Quality,"Its a very low quality product.Very bad picture and video quality. Its nice that it plays mp3, thats a positive side but other than that I would not suggest it. pay some more and get a decent product or else it will be lying at a dusty corner..."
3,Not a bad film,Phase 7 is not a horror film but what would happen if an outbreak was to happen outside and you have to stay in an apartment complex where you live and what the residents would do to each other to survive. Definitely worth checking out.
4,An enjoyable flick,"I had seen previews of this movie and couldn't decide if I wanted to give it a try. I'm glad I did.The story starts with a couple grocery shopping and then a flood of people enter and start grabbing everything. They make it home without knowing what was going on all around them.I don't think this was meant as a too serious End of the world film because it isn't. Some of the acting was almost over the top but over all they did a good job.This isn't a horror story or a Rambo story. Its a simple little film of the people who live in an Apartment building who are closed off from the rest of the city because a virus is running amuck and there are deaths all over from it.From the husband who really isn't sure of how he should act, the couple of low life neighbors who decide to take supplies from an elderly gentleman ( who happens to be a big game hunter) to the next door neighbor who appears to be ready for anything.This is a fun little movie worth buying and watching."
1,"Sorry excuse for a movie, entertainment or ""educational""","Worst waste of money I've spent in a long while. Poor quality, very boring, shut it off before halfway point."
1,waste of time,"Total waste of time and 4 dollars, if you dont have nothing to watch, watch the Teletubies instead of this, incredible boring, cheap, no content movie.Ps: I speak spanish, and even understeanding the dialog , this movie is bad."
2,Not recommended for under a year!,"I tried this for my 6 month old, who had a bad reaction apparently to the raspberries, as he had been introduced to pears prior to that. My pediatrician chastised me and said that berries of any kind shouldn't be introducted to infants until they are at least a year old. We love Earth's Best baby foods, but now I know to do extra research and not assume that just because the label says ""6 months and up"" doesn't make it okay!"
5,Oh yum,Love the Pears and Raspberries blend! It is a great sweet blend. As I have said on many reviews before we are loyal Earth's Best fans.
2,A GREAT COVER,"Well, I liked the cover. I liked the storyline. I could not get into the writing and had to stop pretty early on which always pains me. I often wonder if things would change and if nothing else, where the writer was going to take the story. But I've learned that life is too short and there are just too many books waiting to be read. I just don't have the time to muddle through one that is poorly written. This was the first book I've read by this authors so it may very well have just been an off book for her."
2,THE COVER WAS GREAT.,"Well, I liked the cover. I liked the storyline. I could not get into the writing and had to stop pretty early on which always pains me.

4,Pnuematic Nibbler,I used the nibbler on 22 gauge 304 stainless. The sheet was embossed with a tread plate. For the most part the tool performed well. However performance dropped if the compressor dropped below 150 psi constant. Nibbler heads wore quickly however stainless is not a soft material.The tool was used to cut out a backsplash for uour kitchen. I purchased 5 additional nibbler dies to complete job. The tool did the job and it was of reasonable cost even with the purchase of additional dies ($10 each).
3,Returned Item,I bought this item because I needed to cut Alumumin soffits The tool is just like a Dremal type machine except more expensive I guess it cuts only flat metals
1,Broken,"This pneumatic nibbler was broken and useless. Unfortunately I ordered it for my adult son for Christmas, and he didn't attempt to use it until June. By then it was too late to return it. I guess I learned to avoid this brand, and to inspect everything carefully immediately."
3,not a bad tool,not a bad tool. doesn't last long on 16ga steel. buy extra dies if you need to do many feet of steel.
1,data cable,didnt really work for me. the cable didnt work for my phone. was unable to transfer data from my phone to my computer. kinda mad about that.
2,Pointless,"This is honestly a very pointless and useless device. I used it once the day it came and never used it again. You will think all your phone downloading problems will be over with this, little did you know that they have just begun."
1,It smells like fish and a cheap metal,I BOUGHT THIS FOR CAMPING.BUT WHEN IT ARRIVED IT SMELLED LIKE FISH AND WAS DIRTY.I WANT TO RETURN IT AND IT WAS NOT NEW WHEN IT CAME .I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS PRODUCT.
2,Cheap imitation of Esbit,"I bought this as an experiment to see how it performed against the Esbit stove.Initial impression was that the metal used is much thinner and more flexible than the Esbit. I also don't understand why it was painted. Solid fuel will blacken the stove anyway, maybe they thought it would be more attractive. However, the paint bubbled immediately, and it seemed pointless to have it painted.Next, I put in the fuel, and opened the stove to the narrower of two positions to accommodate a camp pot. About 5 seconds later, one side of the stove collapsed, spilling water all over the place.I tried again, and it collapsed again, so I opened it full sized, and delicately balanced the pot.At this point, the stove worked as designed, and boiled my water in a reasonable fashion. However, I would not be able to use this stove with several of my other camp mess equipment.The price is OK, and the fuel tablets are much less expensive than Esbit - but the stove is built a little too cheaply."
4,Good little stove,"I liked this stove. Very small and lightweight, perfect for backpacking. With 2 fuel pellets I boiled 2 cups of water in less than 10 min. It was about 55 degrees that night. i was supprised how much flame I got out of it. Not fancy but a good bare essential stove that is small and light and really works."
3,"Good, except for the paint","As another reviewer notes, it is painted black and the paint burns off in the first fire. It got all over my brand new titanium pot and made it smell funny. I'm seeing if the dishwasher takes it off. That's what earned this three stars. Yes, it only happens the first time, but this is an annoying problem with a simple fix due to something that doesn't benefit the stove whatsoever.Other than that, this is a great stove. It will be perfect for my 7 day backpacking trip. I tested it out, bringing 2 cups of water to a rolling boil in 10+ minutes with 2 tablets plus some twigs. I did not try the tablets alone on the water, but I did try a couple under a pan with nothing in it in order to make sure it was the black paint and not residue from the tablets that came off on my pot... They made a respectable fire."
2,Is this the real Watchman Nee?,"Some of these late offerings of works that are supposed to be authentic are very weak and lack the anointing that is on his other works. This is one of the worst. It lacks the depth and authenticity of other works. Read ""The Body of Christ a Reality"" instead."
3,Alright book,I really didn't like or dislike this book. It has some pretty good information. It's not just one of those books that JUMPS OUT at me with lots of new information.
4,What a Wonderful Book,"I first ran into Classical Loop-in-Loop Chains in it's paperback form while a student at GIA in Carlsbad. I made a couple chains while a student and found I like it very much. The book gave clear understandable instructions and the step by step format was easy to follow.I have noticed in making some of the chains that there are discrepancies between text and photographs, so be careful in using some of the photographs as guides. Remember, measure twice, cut once. Also, the toggle catch described in chapter 9 has never worked well for me when following their directions. The bar the describe is too short for the size of the opening in the mating ring. I have stopped using that and now use a toggle catch of my own design.All in all an excellent resource. I would heartily recommend it."
4,Good Read !,I found the book very compelling .. I'm not very religious. but found the book very easy to read. The characters were well brought out and there was a feeling of suspense and expectation right to the last chapter. Well Done !
3,"Okay pics, not a lot of substance","It has a lot of good video, and a little background information, but it seeemed disjointed and not very well organized. Not bad, just not very good. I would not recommend this one."
3,"Wireless Optical Desktop for Mac - Oh, really?!","I decided on this keyboard primarily because of the 22 Hotkeys feature. I'm running 10.4 Tiger OS and, as recommended, I downloaded Kensington's latest driver. Well, guess what? Their latest software hasn't been updated since 12-2003, which barely covers 10.3 Panther OS! It may work just fine with Panther - I don't have any way to check - but most of the hotkeys (and who knows what else?) simply do not function with Tiger. I'm not going with a lower rating only because I'm guessing this is probably a decent product when used with an older Mac OS. But come on Kensington - if you're going to market a product for Mac, the least you could do is make some effort to keep your drivers current with the latest Mac OS!"
1,Mouse ok but keyboard does't work,"No matter how hard I tried, the keyboard would never sync. The tech support was useless too."
1,Piece of Junk,I concur with the other negaative reviews. I cannnot useee thee thing aand hd to replacee it. No matter how fresh the batteries the signal is veeery weak. Even from a distance of 4-5 inches from the transmitter the keyboard mises about 1/3 of the key strokes or erverses the order of the eltters.Youuu neeever nkow wat wil coome out. Even a brief exxxcursion onlineee can be veeery frustratingggg.
1,Terrible product,"I have never been as disappointed in a computer peripheral as I am with this keyboard. For starters, the mouse never worked - it shipped DOA. The keyboard was constantly skipping letters and duplicating entries. The only troubleshooting for this symptom from the manufacturer was to ""re-sync"" the keyboard with the base station. I did this several times, and still got results like ttttthis. I adjusted the keypress speed and repeat in the control panel with no luck. I cannot recommend this product to anyone."
5,"Get to know Dali, a genious","If you like Dali paintings, you will love this book, it is ultra funny and crazy, it shows you Dali's toughts and every day life, a life that can be everything but common, it is written in a style that will make you finish reading it faster than any other book and craving for more of Dali's writings.GM"
1,Disappointed In Bionaire Product,"The first Bionaire air cleaner that I purchased in 2004 broke down within 3 months of use...Amazon had it replaced, and now the replacement has also broken down and won't start. What's going on with these Bionaire air cleaners? ModelBAP1175 Quietech HEPA Air Cleaner."
1,DON'T BUY- DEFECTIVE,"Several other reviews list this exact same problem. It worked the first day, then stopped working sometime in the middle of the night and never turned on again. I'm returning and switching brands.It's not really quiet, either, but maybe mine was (obviously) defective. I just bought a Holmes which is quieter than the Bionaire, and the Holmes is not even advertised as ""Quietech"". What a piece of junk!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"Unfortunately, I didn't pay attention to the Amazon reviews before buying and I paid the price. The Bioaire worked fine for exactly one month and then it died. I called Bionaire and they told me to reset it by unplugging the machine for 15 minutes and then plugging it back in. That worked for two days, then it died completely. I cannot believe Bionaire continues to sell a machine that CLEARLY has serious motor issues. In any case, I'm returning it to Amazon and getting a refund. What a waste."
1,Stopped working after a few weeks.,"I liked the item when it first arrived. It was compact and very quiet. However, it stopped working after a few weeks! It died and never worked again. I'm waiting for a return pickup. Based on the other reviews I don't want a replacement."
1,I experienced loud flapping when I turned it on,"It was extremely loud and by the time the unit was on the high setting, I thought it was going to take off. I sent it back and now must wait a month for the replacement."
1,DOES NOT WORK!!!!,"I purchased 2 of these and neither of them worked right out of the box!Unbelievable!!!! These are terrible. Why does Amazon sell defective merchandise? Look at the reviews, these DON'T WORK!! STAY AWAY FROM BIOAIRE."
1,Quite Loud,"While I have no experience with other air filters, I thought this unit was unreasonably loud. I had planned on sleeping with the unit in my bedroom because it was advertised as the most quiet on the market. On the lowest (sleep) setting there was a ""buzz saw"" sound I cannot sleep with and that, from the noise I heard, may have been caused by tape as described by other reviewers. However, after opening the unit and looking at the fan, I couldn't see any tape. Spinning the fan with my hand elicited a sound like something scraping against the fan blades, but the sound came from an unreachable place inside the unit. I have requested an exchange and hope the next unit performs better."
1,Yikes look at these reviews! Mine is dead too.,"I bought a BAP3175 from Target and thought I was getting a good deal since it was clearance priced ($89). Worked great for about 2-3 weeks then everything went south. When I do get it to run, it only runs on 'Low' and then shuts off for no reason. I had thoughts of trying to fix it, but now I'm just gonna pitch it and buy another brand. I'm amazed at these reviews out here. How can a simple appliance be such a consistent POS? Good Job Bionaire!"
1,Add mine to the List - DEAD,"I had high hopes, mine worked for 2 months. Long story short, DEAD. Customer Service was NO help at all. POS"
1,Bionaire BAP 1175,This is the second one I am getting (the first one was replaced within 2 weeks of receipt)and it broke again. The electronic breaks down with no reason and we received the item with a loose screw to start...Very disappointing. Do NOT Buy
4,Quiet and Does the Job,"I have allergies. I hate dust and sneeze when working in the yard. I suffered for years, and added two of these units to our home a year ago. Now, with one in the bedroom and den, I can't image life without them. I can tell the difference and I sleep better and hardly sneeze at all. The three stage filters are a snap to clean and change. The unit is quiet and I love the romote on the larger unit. I am a believer in HEPA filters and what they do. I have no negative comments."
1,Don't bother...,"I bought this as a gift for my parents. It worked for about 48 hours after we opened it up on ""Christmas Day and then it died never to be revived. We just sent it back and I foolishly asked for another before checking here to find that lots of others (think of how many more considered posting but did not) had the very same experience.I had purchased a Friedrich C-90A for myself a couple of months earlier. It is great, no problems so far and it really cleans the air well (it was raited #1 by Consumer Reports btw). Pricey but I imagine it will last years instead of hours. If you want something that really works -- and you can easily clean the filters -- spring for the Friedrich. Your health is worth it."
1,Defective And Not Reliable,I ordered this air cleaner for my parents as a gift. They received the item brand new and it seemed to have worked fine for one day and then the fan just stopped working. They sent it back and a replacement was sent. The replacement worked for a few days just fine and then the same problem with the fan occurred. I told them to send it back for the refund. This item starts off working fine but then it just dies on you. It seems to have some sort of defect and is not reliable at all. I do not recommend this item at all.
1,2nd unit same defect,"This is the second unit with the same defect. works for a couple of days, if the Bionaire BAP1175 is then powered off it will not power back on again. Also unable to change speed settings. I have asked for another replacement but based on other reviews I expect to receive another lemon. I will ask for a refund if the third unit is defective."
4,well worth the $,"this is one of those products that does what it is said to do.the 4 level fan is a great addition, try one out--this is a keeper"
1,Must be disposable,"My daughter has had some severe respiratory issues, so my husband and I decided to purchase the 1175. Within a month of running it 27/7 on low, the display on the unit, disappeared and a couple of the fans stopped working. Thinking that there was an issue with just my unit and foolishly not looking on here, we asked for a replacement. When we received it, the same thing happened, the display faded and this time, we woke up one morning to nothing - the motor had quit. Needless to say, we didn't even bother to ask for a replacement, just a refund."
1,Repeatedly defective,"The Bionaire BAP1175 air filter worked for a few days and then two out of the four fans speeds stopped working. The unit was replaced, only to find that the replacement lasted a matter of hours before the fan stopped completely."
1,Don't waste your money!,"If you want to invite frustration into your life, order this air purifier. It is nothing but a waste of time, money and energy. This company should be sued for the volume of defective units it sells. I tried out a total of three brand new identical units and all stopped working after a month. The display screen got all funky and the fan just stops randomly, then it never goes back on again. Competely frustrating. I purchased a second unit thinking there was something wrong with the first. After the second broke down I called Bionaire and they sent me a new third unit to try, but only after I paid $25 to send my disfunctional unit back. This unit direct from the factory had the same exact problems. After all is said and done, it was such a waste of time and money. Please don't buy this unit. Bionaire needs to take responsibility for the poor quality product they are peddling."
4,"A Dark, Twisted Fairy Tale......Loved it.","""Running Scared"" is one of the movies that gets plastered by professional critics, and it doesn't deserve that at all. This film is 100% Balls to the Wall energy from start to finish. It is intense, dark, violent, disturbing and A LOT OF FUN! Alot of people take the film TOO literally. When you watch it take notice of the fact some things are sped up, images and shadows are distorted into nightmarish figures, some of the characters are way over the top, but they are wonderfully fleshed out and acted on screen. ""Running Scared"" is one of those films that delivers the thrills and the action. It is a strange, urban fairytale that puts you on edge. If your on the fence, I hope you read this review and take the chance, I doubt you will be dissapointed.....that being said it is in no way suitable for children...for you parents out there."
4,One of Paul Walkers better action flick.,There ares so many different dub-plots in this movie you might be afraid of losing track. You won't in this one. Both sentimental AND tough story lines converge into an ending that could go either way. It is exciting with enough of American violence to keep the most jaded interested.
3,Disturbing or great?,"Im not sure if this film is incredibly great, or incredibly disturbing. There are a lot of parts in the film that are just plain not right, however there are topics that are rarely discussed in films.The whole movie is just plain violent. A lot of killing right from the beginning. It goes from drugs, to sleazy families, to dysfunctional children and deprived people.Im not a big Paul Walker fan, but he did an ok job in this one. Involving a child in films where they carry a gun and ""shoot"" at people is a little weird too.Overall, its a movie that gets into topics and shows scenes that are really disturbing. However, it gives insight into what really goes on with dysfunctional people.Not sure if it makes the movie great, or just plain wrong."
2,"""Grand Theft Auto: The Movie"" is more like it!","This movie was soooo ridiculous it was truly a friggin shame. It kind of plays out like a ""Sin City"" rip-off, but without a linear storyline. This movie was put together like a bunch of college kids who origianly came up with a good idea for movie but didnt know how to put it together. The story is choppy and it goes every which way, and in the end you are not even sure if the plot even makes sense or if it even exist! The guys who wrote this movie wrote it like a comicbook mini-series, in the sense the story is told in blocks and chunks. That style of writing is great for a comic book, but when you want to make a movie you have to pull every thing together. The visuals were pretty good though."
3,"Good, but still Paul Walker...","I was actually very surprised at enjoying this movie . There are a hand full of seens that are really, really good . The plot is good enough to hold your interest, and the climax is worth the wait. I never had any interest in Running Scared , because it stars Paul(worst actor in the world) Walker . He is one of a increasingly large number of talentless actors who I can't stand to watch . In the spirit of that theme, I will note that he adds nothing significant to this movie. Actually I could think of many actors who could have done a better job with the role . His character, Joey, spends the majority of the movie evading multiple groups of dangerous people who are looking for him , and trying to find a gun that was in his care and was used in two seperate crimes . I would recommend seeing it, and I will probably watch it again myself ."
5,FAVORITE MOVIE,VERY SUSPENSEFUL ... Movie changes direction a lot.. roller coaster of a movie .. hope everyone watches and enjoys this movie
4,"(Used) Wrong Case, Great Movie","If you like this movie, it's worth the $3 (including shipping). The CD was in great condition for being used and the case artwork is in phenominal shape. The only problem is that it's in a blockbuster case that is a nucense to snap shut and that no pamphlet came with it on the inside."
3,GOOD ACTION FILM MUCH BETTER THAN AVERAGE,This movie is way better than I expected.The action never stops and the story is interesting enough to keep you in the groove. The DVD transfer is excellent and is a worth a look for sure.
1,violence for violence sake,"This movie doesnt even make sense. Your watching it and saying to yourself ""what? why? how?"" The point of the movie seems to be to TRY ( and fail ) to connect an endless stream of scenes of violence and trying to kill children. The scene of the couple making child porn and murdering the children was especially sick. The writer / director of this movie has some issues. This movie is for the fans of extreme close ups of graphic bloody violence and no one else."
1,Too Long,"This movie was too long and there were too many characters in it. It would've been interesting if the Muppets were thrown in there, you know, for some humor. Thanks to the dumb rappers, I got to hear a white guy call another white guy the n-word. Other than that, this movie is too dark and no children should've starred in it. Adult midgets should've been used instead. There was too much second-hand smoke going around too. Anyway, if dude would've gotten rid of the gun in the first place, he wouldn't have had no problems."
5,Paul Walker and Vera Farmigia Best Roles,"This is an incredibly adrenalin-pumping violent action thriller with brilliant acting, direction, casting and soundtrack. Some of the sub-plots are downright chilling. The title design alone has been since copied by other films. Can't wait to see this on Blu-ray, will let you know."
4,Great Action Film,"This is a great action film, even if a little hyperbolic. For those with short attention spans, it also moves at a blistering pace--though not, I should mention, in the same way as a Ridley Scott film. The musical score also suits the film quite well."
2,I hunting this movie down to give it two stars,"The reasons why this gets a two.1: There is not one normal person in this movie. Everyone carries a gun, knife, everyone deals drugs, everyone is a perv. Each character that comes in the movie is messed up. Completely stupid.2: the word f**k is used so much, I was almost laughing at one scene that was suppose to be serious. imdb.com records 328 it is said, the movie itself is only 122 minutes. Do the math and figure how many times you'll hear it a minute. Thats abusing it,taking away the effect of the word.but its also pretty sick and gory, which is cool. so expect a haedcore action movie that is completely unbelieveable."
5,Surprisingly good movie,"I loved the fact that Vera Farmiga was so tough in this movie. I saw this movie in the theatre, rented it on Netflix...twice, and now I purchased it."
3,Movietime/Amazon,"I enjoy watching movies and purchased this good, action movie that I enjoyed watching and always wanted for my movie library. The movie arrived in good condition and right on time. I will definitely order from Amazon again."
2,Red Door Shower Gel,"Although package arrived in a timely manner, I can't give this product a great review. My wife's favorite perfume is Red Door and according to her this shower gel smells nothing like Red Door. A bit disappointing."
1,Returns,"I am still waiting on an answer to my qoestion about returning 1 pair for a widerr size. It's been 2 weeks.have not heard anything at all, Shame!"
4,Women Safety Kit,"I really loved the nice blue and silver case. The items inside are quite handy, and I've have used several of them. The only down side is the poor quality of the fashlight. It does not work, and is a bit flimsy. The kit I purchased for a friend, also has a bad flashlight. I wanted to return the flashlight, but felt foolish about sending back one item. So I purchased a flashlight to keep in the kit. Overall, a good item to keep in your car, and a great gift for friends. Just replace the flashlight!!"
5,I purchased this for all my clients,"Wow, if you are an entrepreneur or small business owner who wants to stay motivated and on track, this book is for you. I purchased it when it was first published and have purchased dozens of copies since for my clients. Chellie Campbell provides just the right mix of business advice, motherly nagging and beautifully woven metaphor-stories that can motivate me even on my most stubborn days. From this book I have learned how to give up the ""I am so tired blues"" and how to find and play with dolphin (the best) type of clients. A story I return to over and over is the story of Bijan - the knight in shining armor tow truck driver who reminds us that even in what seems to be bad circumstances, we really are very lucky. Do yourself a favor. Buy this book and savor it. I have - since 2002."
5,"You'll Laugh, You'll Cry","The Wealthy Spirit is not a book about money. It is a book about how to live a rich, full, beautiful life and make money along the way, doing what you love. It is full of amazing, true stories of real people who, if you follow the principles they followed, will inspire you to your greatness. Each story starts with an amazing quote by someone famous and then each story is followed by an uplifting affirmation, that if repeated, will help the reader be happier and richer! The writings are so well done and poignant. I can't wait to give this book to everyone I know."
4,The Wealthy Spirit,This self-help book is designed to be used a page at a time for a year. The author intends for her readers to free themselves from debt and take control of their finances. A good book for those who feel they are not in control of their money.
5,"Healthy, Wealthy and Wise","In THE WEALTHY SPIRIT, Chellie Campbell turns the crusty adage ""money can't buy you happiness"" inside out. Here she has minted a fresher and healthier revelation: ""happiness can buy you money."" She begins in the heart and moves to the head and creates an approach that is elegant in simplicity and universal in language. The reader feels that Chellie's passion is compassion and that it extends beyond the mere attraction of dollars. What we put out to the world in our optimism, faith and true personal worthiness comes back to us in our quality of relationships as well. Her compendium of wisdom is gleaned from experience and will greet the reader with that ""I've been there"" assurance. As her approach to financial recovery is more about the journey, THE WEALTHY SPIRIT makes an easygoing traveling companion along the road to personal and professional enrichment."
2,Beware The Glue Idiots,"Beware the glue idiots. This company does not test it's products for longevity whatsoever and 3 years after owning this mouse the soft rubber 'side panel inlays' are coming off all by themselves and the 'glue' that 'held' them in place is decomposing on it's own and becoming a sticky unusable gooey mess that renders the mouse useless, gets all over you, gets all over the mouse pad and is unbelievably annoying. To Kensington: Idiots, Test your products."
4,Very nice mouse,"Everything about it is comfortable and functions smoothly. I have an Apple G4 and hate the mouse they come with. Ugh, they're soooo terrible. But this is a great replacement, with the right-click working in OS 10.3 with NO software installations or anything.One problem - it doesn't work on a wooden surface, or at least it wouldn't work on my desk. Can you believe that??? WTF? I had to buy a piece of contact paper and cut it to fit my computer desk's mouse area. Now its all good, but that sure was annoying, I almost thought it was broken! So, prepare to get something to put under it if you are one of the millions and millions of people using a wooden desk! Other than that, its brilliant."
2,Unclear and difficult to follow,"This dvd was very hard to follow. Sometimes the dancers feet weren't even visible. There were no instructions on leads, and just the bare minimum on footwork, and most of the time there wasn't any instruction at all. The instruction for the woman was ""the woman does the natural opposite"". That's it! If you can learn just by watching a couple dance then this dvd is fine. If you want an ""instructional"" dvd, the Dance Authority series is much better."
3,"Unfortunately, it SOUNDS too much like a bootleg...","I bought this CD mainly for the Pussycat Song. Heard it on the radio a while back, it's hilarious. However, I think anyone who attempts to listen to the CD might need a radio station's gear and/or expertise to resurrect the vocals, which are buried deeply in the background, with lots of crowd noise, laughing, etc. in the foreground. Could barely make out what was being sung. I had to look up the song's lyrics on the web, just to follow along (printed lyrics aren't included with the CD's front material, by the way). A bit of a disappointment, I'm afraid. Too bad..."
4,Exciting and breathtaking...and that's just the scenery!,"I'll start by saying Meryl Streep can do no wrong. Kevin Bacon is the difinitive bad guy. Edge of your seat excitemnt running the rapids, and the cinematography is awesome. This is one film that should be released in blueray format."
3,"Good movie, bad download","This was my first video download from amazon and the video quality was horrible. Such a shame for a film with such awesome scenery. I'll give amazon video on demand one more try but if the quality isn't better, I'll just be content that I had gotten a free code for it."
5,The River Wild,"Kevin Bacon is so bad (devious & evil), he's good!Meryl Streep also puts in a good performance.Entertainment with suspense. I enjoyed watching it.I watched 3 other films with Kevin Bacon in malicious roles,so he died 4 times that day!! Then I watched Footloose..."
4,excellent movie,"excellent movie with great acting. there are some holes in why what the husbands does in the end works, but not a big issue."
5,Meryl Streep Fan,"I received a Kindle Fire for Christmas from my family. It has not been out of my sight ever since. I wanted to put some go to movies for me since I travel quite a bit. The River Wild is a strong woman type of film, where in the end she gets her man in more ways than one. The scenery is great and have traveled to where they filmed on the Rogue River in southern Oregon. Hard to believe it was filmed in 1994. You can pick apart any movie, I just have really liked this for years."
3,Entertaining action yarn,"Entertaining, yet stretching the boundaries of credibility, yarn puts Meryl Streep into G.I Jane action mode and places her character on a river rafting expedition with her emotionally distant husband and loving child. Trying to utilize the river as a basis for brining the family closer together again, that is all rapidly sped up when two escaped convicts join the raft as their means of escape. Meryl is convincingly good as usual and Kevin Bacon, as one of the escaped thugs, gives an alarmingly icy performance. The scenery is picture perfect postcard material and the direction under the oft under used Curtis Hanson is subtle and raw in all the right places."
3,"Good action, but could have been much better","Meryl Streep does an action heroine turn as Gail, a river guide in an unhappy marriage to David Sraithairn. For a change of pace, they hit the waters, where the family is forced to aid two runaway criminals (Kevin Bacon and John C. Reilly). This is a very different role for Streep, and she manages to make it fit and seems very believable. Bacon is somewhat threatening, and the river action scenes are all very good. BUT, this movie gets bogged down by the hokey plot contrivances (their dog who happens to magically appear at precise moments, Ranger Johnny (Benjamin Bratt, before Law & Order) and other plot holes. Good, but could have been a much better story."
5,"""The River Wild"" DVD","I received the DVD ""The River Wild"" very quickly, and it arrived well packaged and in perfect condition as promised. I was very impressed with the professionalism of this seller and won't hesitate to purchase from them again. I buy a lot of movies, mostly DVDs but VHS as well, on Amazon.com and from their Marketplace sellers; I would put this seller right on top with the best of them for their terrific service and integrity. Thanks for the pleasant transaction!"
3,Good But Not Great,"I was a nice change, lots of great actors. but it seamed to be missing that certain something. Seeing it once was enough."
3,The River Wild Review,"If I were to give a rating for the scenery and the filming it would be five stars. However the story and the acting don't rate more that three stars. Having said that, the story held my interest to the end and I found that as the movie progressed it got better as far as the acting. So it is just okay, but if you like Montana scenery or the mountains or river rafting, I highly recommend watching."
3,Streep Does Her Best With a Somewhat Cheesy Script,"There were quite a few moments in the film that just weren't well acted or that believable. Actually, the problem was more with the script than the acting. There were too many plot points in which we are required to suspend disbelief and go along with an absurd moment that makes absolutely no sense. This movie has more in common with a low budget action flick with a contrived ending than a high quality suspense film that keeps you guessing. There was definitely no guessing about the end of this movie. About halfway through the movie you know exactly how it's going to turn out.Still, if you're looking for a couple of hours of dumb fun mixed with a modicum of suspense, this might work."
4,The Wild River,My grandson is a Meryl Streep fan and I decided to give him some of her earlier work that I had enjoyed as we are working to completed his colletion.
4,White Water Rafting Thrills With Streep And Bacon,The opening scenes of THE RIVER WILD show a very buff Meryl Streep rowing in Boston's Charles River accompanied by stirring theme music by Jerry Goldsmith. This promise of quality is fulfilled throughout the suspenseful albeit rather predictable movie after the setting switches to the western wilderness. Meryl Streep and Kevin Bacon are among Hollywood's most talented and versatile actors and in this outing Streep believably plays a mom who meets extreme physical and emotional challenges (while piloting a white river raft no less) after she encounters Bacon a cunning criminal psychopath. The river scenes are beautiful and I've read that Streep actually did her own stunts for the most part. There are a couple of surprises along the way to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. A good movie for anyone but especially a family with older kids who want a little bit but not too much edge to their viewing experience.
5,I LOVE IT,I LIKE IT VERRY MUCH I LIKE THE WAY JOSEPH MAZZELLO LOOKS IN THE MOVIE.ANYWAY THE MOVIE ISDA BOMB
1,The word that describes this movie does not exist,"This movie was dull, predictable and dull. I guessed before the movie was half over that Kevin Bacon was the bad guy who held up the Livestock Auction. I also guessed that the Husband who was ""dead"" would make like Lazarus and come back to life and along with the runaway Dog would save everyone from certain death. Meryl Streep acted as though she was half awake and bored during the entire movie, she hardly woke up when the raft went down the rapids. Save your time and money and pick a different film."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"The mini-tramp part is only 20 minutes--about 10 minutes of that is warm up, abs and cool down!!! The pilates section is about 18 minutes--probably okay, but I bought the workout because it said it is Cardio and Core Mini-Tramp! I am very disappointed!"
2,not as rigorous,I was a little disappointed in the intensity of the cardio workout with this DVD. The pilates is pretty good.
2,A First Attempt,"From reading over the reviews, I see that I'll be in the minority but I am currently reading this book and it is a bit frustrating. There are great endorsements by writers of prominence in the African American community and I'm wondering if they read the book or the excerpt. The latter is excellent and I thought the storyline was great but the writing is disappointing. The transitions and dialogue between the characters don't jibe and I'm finding them to be unbelievable. I'm not connecting with them. While I understand this is a first novel, I have read much better."
2,Poor grammar,"I read the first three chapters of this book and decided not to continue. I had a problem with the grammar. It's terrible and made it difficult for me to follow the story. It's probably a good story but I'll never know. Read the ""Look Inside"" first pages before deciding on this book."
1,pearl,"this book is a ""must read"", a story of getting on with your life after heartbreak, and on having the courage and faith in who you are to live your life your own way. pearl knows who she is and learns what she truly is like through her friendship with sugar. this book shows us what friendship,love,lies,death,betryal can do to our lives. and that we can let them overcome us, or let them make us better. bravo ms mcfadden!"
5,"""Sugar"" by Bernice McFadden","It's rare to read a book that touches you so much you think about it long after you've read the last page. Sugar was one of those books. Both Sugar and Pearl will be with me for a long time, and I really, really hope Ms. McFadden's next book will be a sequel. I HIGHLY recommend this one...even suggested it to a book club I belong to. I really want to discuss Sugar in a group! Wonderful job, Ms. McFadden, and PLEASE do a sequel."
4,A Fresh Literary Talent,"Although open minded, I naturally have a tendency to be skeptical when it comes to modern day quality literature. But I am happy to say that I was sorely proven wrong by Ms. McFadden's novel, Sugar. The lyrical exposition present at its beginning pulled me in and made it difficult for me to let it go. Ms. McFadden's descriptions of the ante-Civil Rights South are reminiscent of those that Langston Hughes expunged in the tales of Simple and Not Without Laughter. Sugar is a poignant depiction of Pearl's desire to help Sugar make her life respectable. Despite Sugar's intial resistance, she and Pearl form a bond that rekindles a maternal love in Pearl that was never fully realized because her own daughter was lost to murder many years before. Ms. McFadden does an excellent job of interweaving several plot lines together to provide the reader with a cohesive storyline that is neither confusing nor exhausting. Definitely a good read!"
5,Honey Chile!!,"Read this book, read this book! It starts out a little slow but once it picks up, boy is it good! That Sugar stirred up some stuff! Once you read this one you must read the sequel This Bitter Earth."
4,"Wonderful, Fast Read","This is a must read. It was symbolic in a sense. I understood forgiveness, regret, and remorse. This book captures your attention from the first page. I started reading the book about 12:00p.m. I was finished at 11:00p.m. I could not put it down. It may be graphic for some, but it gave just enough detail for the reader to understand. I did not like the ending because I wanted more. Read it!"
3,"Great writing, Great Story Line!","This us a good book club selection. The story keeps moving and the author does an excellent job making sureshe gets right to the point. Characters come alive in this tale. There is a good deal of ""sexcapades"" in the book...but I think it rings true to form. 3 stars because I just finished a true 5 star book and the 2 are not in the same leag ue. Still a great read and I plan to read more from this author."
4,Just outstanding,"I've read Sugar, this bitter earth and camilla's roses...ALL GREAT books. Bernice does a wonderful job telling a compelling story, you're not going to be able to put the book down.Sometimes her stories are a bit depressing but they are still great!, I do feel that her endings seem a bit rushed, that's my only issue, other than that, it's great!"
5,A MUST READ! VERRRRRRRRRY GOOD!,"Sugar, by Bernice Mcfadden, is all things I like in a book. It has history, envy, crime, and most of all, intrigue. This is a must read for every one. I had one problem with the book, I wanted Sugar and her Great-Grandmother to have it out, to put her in her place. I also wanted Pearl to tell Sugar that Shirley was her Great-Grandmother. It also would have been nice if Joe, had told Sugar that he was her father. Other than that, it still was a very very good book. So good that I didn't want it to end. Keep up the good work Ms. McFadden, I eagerly await the next book."
5,Slow Start But Worth The Wait,"This book was difficult for me to get into at first but I was determined to hang in there and glad that I did. I found the writing and character development great. The story however was very sad, particularly what ultimately happens to Sugar and her revelation that she is who she is and 2 weeks won't change it. However, I loved the way that she stood up for herself in church just before she left. Neither the characters or story line were superficial and seemed to be the product of careful thought and deliberation. The only regret is that I wished the lineage between Sugar and Shirley would have been revealed, if for no other reason than to put Shirley in her place...does this mean a sequel? I think there are so many lessons one can take from this book starting with personal redemption, judgement, acceptance of people who are different and on to unconditional love. I loved this book."
5,Absolutely Perfect!,"Bernice McFadden writes with an eloquence that I haven't seen in a long time. Her writing is powerful, sincere and hits you with emotions about struggles in life, poverty, racism, sex and rape from situations of long ago and we can certainly apply those same situations to our lives today. Bigalow exists in every city and town and there's definitely a little ""Sugar"" in all of us. Congratulations Ms. McFadden...looking forward to reading more fantastic books in the future!"
4,A very touching story,"For a while, I could not figure out where this book was going or the relationship between the characters. Once it was revealed, then the whole story started to make sense. I loved how Sugar awakened Pearl out of her grief and how Pearl pushed Sugar to follow her dreams to be a singer. These two make an endearing pair. This was a very good told story"
4,Good Read,"The story of Sugar is beautiful, tragic, happy, hopeful and sad all at the same time. Well-developed characters and wonderful writing and dialogue. The author is excellent! I highly recommend this one!"
5,May I have more stars?,"This book was sooooo goooood.The way the story starts you would not think that at the end all of the strings will tie together, but they tie together beautifully and suprisingly.Sugar is a very strong woman and a woman who can not and should not be ignored."
4,Compelling read,"This is a compelling story of love hate misfortune and friendship. I thought it was a little too sexually descriptive esp at the beginning with Jude and several other times throughout book with Sugar. In all, I enjoyed this book and so did my 12 bookclub members. We are planning to read the sequel ""Bitter Earth"" for next meeting."
5,It was great,"Sugar was so good, i just love books like this, Sugar is the story of Pearl, a older chrisitan woman who be befriends the new lady in town Sugar who happens to be a prostitute. There was a lot of gossip about their friendship. Sugar reminds Pearl of her daugther who was brutally killed and raped. I kept waiting to see the connection between Pearl and Sugar. Boy was i end for a shock when it was revealed in the book. You don't want to miss reading ""Sugar"
5,Worth reading,First let me say that I love your this book. It's been a long time since I read something with such much depth. This is a story that is truly believable. I wonder how many Sugars have we met in our life and formed a opinion about them before we even get to know them.
3,"Good start, but got slow and unreal near the end","****WARNING***** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!""Sugar"" was the story of 2 different women who end up becoming friends. It's about looking beyond the outside of a person.The book overall was good, but it kind of lost me 1/2 way through. I found it hard to believe a prude, almost senior woman would all of a sudden wear packs of makeup and act like a 20 something. Also it seemed unreal after all those years of being very modest and not doing ""it"" with her husband, all of a sudden getting bold & crazy in bed with her hubby. In addition, I don't see any husband who would come home, see his woman all made over, acting all sexed up and wonder what the heck was going on. Joe seemed too accepting.I did not care that Lappy was not held accountable for any of the nasty things he did. The ending seemed unresolved, but maybe the sequel to this book ties things up."
4,Good Condition and Timely Mailed,The book was in good condition and stated. Received the book in a very timely manner. Well pleased with the transaction. Thank you.
5,Phenomenal...,"Happy Tenth Anniversary for one of the best books I ever read!Margaret Johnson-Hodge, Author of""Red Light Green Light""""Butterscotch Blues""""A Journey To Here""""True Lies'""Warm Hands""""This Time""""A New Day""""Some Sunday""""The Real Deal"""
5,REAL,"The very first page captures you in disbelief, so much that you read it over to make sure you read correctly. You can see the sunset, smell the rain, feel the pain! This book embodied every emotion imaginable. It's a MUST read!!! The sequel is just as equal with an unbelievable twisted ending."
4,Great but left me Wanting,"This book is a Fantastic read, Full of useful information for those of us interested in the Prison Ministry. My only complaint is at under 100 pages it left me wanting more. The book also has important contact information for newbies to get started ministering in a jail/prison type of atmosphere. Well worth the money."
5,Fit the bill!,"User friendly guide. I am interested in jail ministry as a lay person and found this guide a good introduction. Easy to understand, logical advice with interesting stories and examples. I will refer back to this book often."
5,Introduction to Prison Ministry,"Thinking About Jail and Prison Ministries is a tiny book about a weighty subject. It is written for those of us who are considering entering prison ministry. It lays out four basic areas in which the lay minister volunteer can minister behind bars - praise and worship ministry, lay chaplaincy, event ministry, and correspondence ministry. Neilson describes what each of these ministries involves and provides insight that might help a volunteer decide where he/she is called to work. The book is very high level, but very appropriate for the newcomer. As I enter into the world of prison ministry, I feel that I will return to this book again and again."
2,SUGAR MELTS,"Saga has a special friend, Sugar, a weather fairy visible only to her, who at times makes you drown in her sickly saccharine sweetness. She actually would be a little cute if she just kept her mouth shut! With her annoying voice it makes you want to step on her. These two episodes are a flashback of sorts from the perspective of an older Saga as she remembers when her class put on a school play. As Saga's class prepares, Sugar and her fairy friends also begin to produce their own play, with more humorous results.The problem with this show is that it lives by cuteness, but Sugar is more grating than sweet. The only comedy relief you get is from the class prima donna, Greta, who is a walking cliche, and the other fairies. But it's not enough to make this special interesting or engaging. I can't imagine anyone sitting through the 24 episodes of the regular TV series after seeing this sample.I would recommend the anime Figure 17 for a good example of mixing cuteness and plot."
5,One Of The Best,"My 11 year-old neice enjoys ghost stories as much as I do and we both enjoy reading (and re-reading) this book. A lot of stories, most stories are short, some are scary and some are not."
4,"Haunting, but not Scary","This book was one that I had seen advertised for quite a while, so I finally decided to order it. When i received it, I thought that I would be getting a collection of terrifying stories and encounters. What I got instead was a collection on normal citizens encounters, in their own words. This was much more than I was expecting.Some of the stories left me looking over my shoulder at each sound, while some of them left me a little disappointed. All in all, this was a great book, and I recommend it to everyone. The fact that there were this many people that were willing to come forward to a nationwide publication and tell their story made me feel that the world of the unknown will someday be more widely accepted."
3,Short accounts of ghostly content,"These are stories from actual readers, so some of the encounters are a bit short and not scary, but valid paranormal accounts. So read this one if you want to compare some ghostly encounter you may have experienced with theirs.Also its a book that can be put down for awhile and easily picked up where you left off, found it practical when I was very busy and had little time to read."
3,i like this book,"i like this book but have read better , still it was a good read . it is good to hear what other people have seen with their own eyes"
1,Quite possibly the most banal thing ever written,Reads like a newsgroup instead of a book. This book offers nothing by way of insight or commentary on the collected stories. It's a rather dismal attempt to create an anthology of stories.
1,Hideous,"""Hideous!"" was the first thing that came out of my mouth when I opened up this poster. The whole poster is practically blue, and since it's a large size it's even more obvious. Trust me on this, find another poster with colors that are closer to the original."
3,Not a bad book but not a quick course,"The idea that anyone can satisfactorily learn a language in seven days is ludicrous but, I took the bait and bought the book. Given the fact that it is popularly priced, I didn't waste any money. The seven days are actually seven lessons. Each lesson might be mastered in a week, not a day. The premise of the book is that a family takes a trip to Spain and each lesson represents a day in their week's journey. Each day presents different situations. The characters in the book are in Spain for seven days but the lessons cannot be mastered that quickly. If you accept the fact that you should use the book over several weeks, it's not a bad book but I am relying on other sources to learn Spanish .. most notably, Berlitz's fine cassette course ""Basic Spanish"""
3,The tapes and book were great!!,"Learn the basic words necessary to communicate when traveling Tapes provide correct pronunciation and are easy to listen too when driving. Each Lesson can be mastered in one day if one is diligent, however, it may take others 10-12 days!! Give it a try, you have nothing to loose"
4,Converstional Spanish in 7 days,I am using this book as part of a 10 week Spanish class. It is a good textas a support for the class.
2,Not very useful,I'm sure this is very useful IF:1- You have absolutely no background in Spanish2- You're British3- You plan to use your spanish on a vacation or business trip to Spain
1,Trust the bad reviews...,"I thought that maybe I'd get a functioning unit, despite the bad reviews I'd read here at Amazon. I thought that surely such a maligned product would have either seen its quality improved or been removed from the Amazon catalog. I thought wrong.My Bionaire BAP 1300-U was every bit as bad as the units other people are complaining about; tempermental on/off, no high fan, only 39% of filter life remaining right out of the box, etc.This fan is a piece of junk; if you order one, you'll just end up returning it. Like I did. I will commend Amazon for a smooth and timely return process/refund, however. The question remains: Why are they still selling this thing?Rich Erickson"
1,Defective Item,"If my air cleaner would have worked properly, I would have kept it. It malfunctioned within the first week of use. I returned the item becuase it stopped working on the low setting and then began to work only on the sleep setting. Additionally, when I received the item, it was improperly assembled, with the side seam disjointed.On the plus, it was not unduly noisy, particularly on the sleep setting. Size and shape were reasonable, color neutral."
2,BAP 1300 - Strike 1 - 2 days of use,"Also after seeing plenty of reviews and doing some 'bang for the buck' analysis... I decided to settle down and order this unit from Bionaire (BAP1300). It had the best CFM for the price. You just take a risk with all the consistent negative feedback on the durability of the unit.I've used this unit for a little under 2 days. The unit stopped responding to the controls and was stuck in the low setting. After unplugging the unit, it completely stopped responding. I will return this unit for a new one, and see if it gets better mileage... perhaps this faulty unit was just a fluke. I'm willing to give them another chance before just doing a complete return on the unit."
1,Horrible Quality Control,"The air cleaner that was shipped to me worked for less than one day before just stopping. I called Bionaire and after being transferred many times I finally got someone who agreed to ship out a new one. It arrived promptly, worked for one day but then would not turn off. After unplugging it and plugging it back in, it did not work at all! I called again. The third one has been working for two weeks now but I had also bought a smaller version, the 1175 for another room in my house and it too is dead after less than a week - the display panel went blank even though it was still running. Now I have to deal with sending it back. There must be some major problem in the electronics - I would never ever buy one of their products again!"
1,Great (when it actually works),"Bought this cleaner and was happily using it. Till one day (2 months later) it was stuck on low. I could not change it, could not turn it off. Called the company and sent the computer to warehouse. Once I got the new cleaner, it was broken. All four welding spots that hold the fan in the center were broken and the fan was floating free. I thought that welding spots were done very cheap. But I will blame UPS for rough shipping and handling. Returned and got the third cleaner. Two weeks, it stops working. I was moving my apartment, thus I decided to toss it in trash. and swore to never buy Holms products again. Back then I was a second year medicals student. I lost money. I lost more time in these exchanges than sleeplessness due to my roommates smoking."
1,Stay away from this product,"I ordered the product in May. Received it in June and it ran for three days and then stopped working. Returned the product with free shipping label and told Holmes (Bionaire) to cancel the order and issue a credit request. They balked and said they would not. I called my credit card and had them cancel payment. About four weeks later another unit showed up on my door. Called Holmes again. They said they would get back in touch with me, of course, they never did. Other unit stiil in the box never opened."
1,Don't order this one,"I ordered this product around Jan/Feb 2005 from AMAZON. It has not been shipped yet. It is delayed to Jun17. I am not sure I can get it at that time. Amazon may delay for another one, two or more months."
2,"Worked very well, then broke","I purchased the Bionare 1300. The unit worked VERY well and I was delighted with many of the design features. I especially liked that the unit could be placed against a wall and still have good air flow. My allergy attacks were reduced significantly. After 2 weeks of use, the unit stopped working. The fan would not turn on at any speed. The display worked fine, but the fan would not turn on no matter what speed was selected. I hope a replacement will last longer because I like the features of this unit so much."
1,Strung out by Amazon,"I can't comment on the quality of this product since my order was never filled by Amazon. I ordered the item on Dec 8 when the claimed delivery was 5-7 days. When I came back just before Christmas to check status, expected delivery had changed to ""Jan 13 - Jan 31"". Then today (Jan 26), Amazon sent me an email asking me to confirm a new delivery of ""Feb 28 - Mar 18"". This was to be a Christmas present in 2004 not 2005! Amazon has a lot of nerve waiting until the last five days before notifying me of another delay of up to a month and a half! Is Amazon that far out in left field with respect to their suppliers? Does Amazon really think this is the way to grow a business? Doesn't Amazon realize that they are not the only distributor out there? Consider an order through Amazon carefully!"
1,BAP 1300 - Don't Buy It,"After waiting too long for Amazon to take this unit into stock I finally cancelled my order as we were well past the start of allergy season. I therefore purchased from Bed, Bath & Beyond... anyway, it didn't matter as for the results. My first unit I tried the digital filter usage display stopped displaying some of the digits and I could therefore not make out the true reading. So I ordered a replacement, this 2nd unit didn't work upon arrival. The LCD power came on... but the fan motor inside did not work. I'm really surprised Bionaire would have such poor product quality as to allow these types of problems to go out the door!"
1,Lemon Unit,"Perhaps I got a lemon, but the unit stopped functioning after 5 days of operation. I returned the unit for full refund though."
1,Item died within 1 month. OEM Samsung is cheaper. Buy it instead.,"This item died within one month of installation. Also, between the time I ordered it and the time it arrived, I found reviews on the net that indicate that Lighting Technologies replacement bulbs are not as good as the OEM Philips bulbs used by Samsung. After my infant mortality I would have to agree. Amazon itself was fantastic providing a full refund - they just need to carry the ""real"" bulbs. Ironically, the OEM Philips bulbs are available from Samsung directly, and they're less expensive than this Lighting Technologies bulb."
5,Fascinating & exciting,A page turner in its own way. Thrilling flying but equally important was the journey of self discovery. Great book for flyers and non flyers. Very readable and well written
1,"A case study of how NOT to be ""pilot in command""","This book was a long slog of often embarassing ""introspection"" by the author to get to the main point which is that if you are going to be pilot in command, YOU have to be pilot in command. There are better aviation books and better authors to learn this lesson from. The photography is beautiful, though."
3,good for airplane nerds,"If you own an airplane and have been wondering why your insurance company won't let you take it south of Mexico, this book will clear up the confusion. The risks of flying over unfamiliar territory, without intermediate weather reports, in the pre-GPS days are astonishing. The book starts off weak, with a lot of psychobabblish pondering that is unlikely to appeal to the pilots for whom the latter portion of the book will be interesting. Beautifully printed and bound. Unless you plan to be immortal, however, I wouldn't recommend the book to a non-pilot; there are better books with which to occupy your limited time on the planet."
